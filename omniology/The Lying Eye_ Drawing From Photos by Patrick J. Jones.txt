grew up in Alaska in the 1960s and 70s. I know Patrick fed from an equally art-bare cup-
board in his part of the world. 
But . . . there was the pulp fantasy and science fiction art to go on. Until I hit my twenties, it 
gave me more than enough. It became the escape pod I both craved and loved. Oh yes, I loved 
the stories when they were at all lovable. But mostly, it was about the art. I loved the often very 
peculiar realism, along with the superhuman grace and strength, the best artists infused into 
their work. Even for the most uneven of stories, great artwork more than made up the differ-
ence.
Much of my childhood was spent pouring over comic books and comic strips for their extraor-
dinary figure drawings: such artists as John Buscema, Hal Foster, and Alex Raymond. For pulp 
novel paperbacks, it was the paintings of course. Those included James Bama, Boris Vallejo, 
Frank Frazetta.
Looking back on my early heroes, I realize the common thread was their gifts for bringing 
strength and grace seamlessly together. And I loved that they did it, in a heightened way, in 
— what seemed to a teenager — a superhuman way. Now, after forty years of looking at and 
doing art, I’ve seen very few figurative artists who’ve been able cultivate “the chops” to pull off 
that superhumanness, let alone pull it off effortlessly. 
Patrick Jones happens to be one of those artists. You won’t be surprised to know that I’ve been 
blown away by Patrick’s work for years. 
However, it’s only been through a happy arrangement of events in the last few months that I 
have had the great pleasure to get to know the human being. Normally given such relatively 
brief history between us, when asked to write an introduction to even such extraordinary work as we 
have here, I would have certainly, politely declined. Instead, I am delighted. And also flat out excited. 
Because it means I get to pass on a little secret about Patrick . . . 
I get the great pleasure of informing you and the rest of the world that the strength and grace we all see 
in Patrick’s artwork is equally matched with the striking kindness and grace of the man himself. That 
makes him world class on two fronts. And it makes it my great pleasure to call hm a friend. And also 
it makes him the ideal mentor to shepherd you through a subject that, in its own way, is as critical to 
creating successful art as is learning how to construct a nose, or a thigh, or a full-figured pose. Because 
the latter is entirely dependent on the former.
So, I leave you in the very privileged position of getting to feast your eyes on the amazing art of my 
friend while being immersed in a master class of how to shoot and and then use the reference from 
the gifted mind that’s done it all so beautifully.
Happy journeys and kind regards, 
Steve Huston

his book is based on a year’s worth of workshops originally written for ImagineFX 
magazine back in 2018. Fun and breezy as a magazine article is to write, there is only 
so much that can be said in a given word length over eight pages a week.
The world has gone through devastating change in that short period and I decided it was 
time to rewrite and build further on the workshops, focusing more on the use of photog-
raphy by artists. I’m writing these words in the midst of the 2020 worldwide Coronavirus 
pandemic which has created an environment where gatherings are forbidden in order to 
prevent the spread of the virus, meaning, among many social events,  life drawing classes 
are cancelled. This makes the use of photographic models as reference, rather than a live 
model, a necessary topic for renewed investigation and discussion.
The use of photography as reference for artists has been an incredible gift, but has also cre-
ated a shift away from observing life, in fact there is no doubt more artists the world over 
now work from photography than from life. 
So, what is the downside? Well the problems, of which there are many, reside in the cold 
cyclopic eye of the camera lens and its relatively primitive idea of depth and focus. We 
have all grown up bombarded by images from this singular lens to the point where most 
of us no longer notice the flaws, even though our binocular eyes see the world in a vastly 
different way. There are programmes that fix photo-distortion to some degree but they 
won’t fix tangents or inform us what certain obscure shadows may represent, and more 
importantly, they don’t train us to see the world as our human eyes do. There’s good reason 
why the Old Masters’ paintings, created in a camera free world, still have so much depth 
and atmosphere.
Opposite is a photo with obvious distortion, which can be dramatic when created pur-
posely as I have done here. But most times the distortion is more subtle and can creep into 
our drawings and betray us. In the following workshops I will work with two of my most 
treasured artistic collaborators, Alana Brekelmans and Katy Woods. Together we will delve 
deep into the multitude of problems regarding distortion, proportion, edges, shadows and 
tangents conjured by light during that brief moment in time when the camera blinks and 
whispers its lies.

lthough I had taught drawing techniques in schools for many years it wasn’t until the 
publication of my first drawing book, ‘The Anatomy of Style’ that I was invited to 
teach live workshops. Since the book was the spur for these private workshops I decided 
to name the workshops after the book. The Anatomy of Style workshops then evolved over 
time to include more advanced teachings based on my follow up book, ‘Figures from Life’. 
Over the course of these chaptered workshops I will draw from photographs to recreate 
the atmosphere of my live workshops and will conduct each demonstration as if class is 
in session with a live model posing. This will offer you a first class seat to watch over my 
shoulder and draw along. I will explain my personal  process and insights as we explore the 
beauty of line and form found in the anatomy of the human figure. A photographic model 
will take the place of a live model and will pose opposite the drawing stages.
Since we will be working from photos I will also focus on guiding us through the typical 
minefield of problems and solutions associated with photo-reference. The camera’s eye can 
be very deceptive and we must be suspicious of every photo we work from, with the prime 
suspects being distortion, often unseen to the untrained eye, as we have come to accept 
the distortion of photos as ‘normal’. Unfortunately that level of acceptance doesn’t extend 
to drawings that are distorted, so we trace photos at our pearl. I believe only professional 
artists up against deadlines should rely on tracing, and even then only as a quick aid to 
get the main elements down. In order not to lean on the crutch of tracing and the many 
evils inherent in that practice I will demonstrate the sheer joy and freedom of drawing 
freehand.

hat duplicitous eye! Our cyclopic nemesis, the camera lens, a 
teller of falsehoods and deceptions. The camera is now in the 
pocket of billions of people on Earth. An amazing revolution 
if we think back to the beginning of the 20th Century when a pho-
tographer needed an able assistant to help carry all their photographic 
equipment.
The camera is so common now that literally trillions of photographs 
are produced every year, most of them through a warped 20-35mm 
lens. This has resulted in a world of  people adjusted to accepting our 
average distorted photos as reality. Show most people a photo and 
they will most likely not see the distortion unless they themselves are 
in the photo, especially near the outer edges of the photo where most 
of the distortion lies. 
Due to an unlimited choice of photo-reference crowding the internet 
artists can easily become lazy cobblers, grabbing what suits their pur-
pose and frankensteining it all together. The unfortunate problem is 
that although we have learned ‘not to see’ distortions and over-sharp 
edges in photos we haven’t yet ‘learned not to see’ those same anoma-
lies in an artist’s drawings. The majority of drawings I observe often 
have a strangeness that reveals the photo-reference source. When a 
drawing is close to reality in the sense of ‘camera lens reality’ it be-
comes unsettling. We have all seen realistic drawings that are a bit 
awkward, not quite perfect, but still realistic in a warped way. Non 
artists may not see the camera distortion in a drawing, but they still 
know something is wrong. When I see a beautiful figure drawing it 
is usually drawn from life, or from a photograph in the hands of an 
artist that knows how to see and correct photo distortion and lens 
anomalies to represent the human eye. In this workshop I will guide 
you on your way to becoming that kind of artist.

oday we will be drawing Katy. Katy is 
a marvellous model who takes no pris-
oners when posing, which is exactly what I 
hope for when posing a model. An exciting 
pose will both challenge us as figurative art-
ists and help expand our imagination. 
In my first figure drawing book, ‘The Anato-
my of Style’, I covered average figure propor-
tions, a practice we should return to often. 
Once thoroughly learned we can store these 
proportions in our subconscious should we 
need them. We must keep in mind, though, 
they are only a guide. Trying to shoehorn 
every figure to fit an eight-head-high ideal 
is the recipe for stiff, uninspired drawings.
When working with models we can add fan-
tasy elements by costuming the model or by 
studying the contours of the figure then add 
them using our imagination, which is the 
path I will demonstrate in this workshop. 
In order to achieve style we need to work 
with gesture, which is the spirit of the pose 
and the fluid nature in line. If we take ges-
ture too far, though, our drawing will look 
wobbly. To counter this problem we need 
to also work with a solid structure, but too 
much structure can make for a stiff draw-
ing, and therein lies the great balancing act 
of figurative art that we will explore together 
throughout these following workshops: the 
artistic balancing act of gesture and struc-
ture.

1 The Eye of the Cyclops: 
Here is Katy perfectly lit and beautifully posed, we could wish for nothing more…until we take a closer 
look. I shot this photo with a 50mm Sigma Prime Lens, the closest lens to the human eye, yet even the 
best lens is still only a single eye; the eye of a cyclops. A single eye is poor at judging depth compared to 
our human binocular vision. Look how small the foot (A) is compared to the head for instance and how 
long the torso has become. The distance from the shoulder to the navel should be similar to the distance 
from the navel to the curve of the upper thigh in a standing pose (B) (the bottom of the gluteus from the 
back view). With that in mind we can appreciate how much distortion we accepted when first looking at 
this photo. By knowing the camera is a lie I approach every drawing from photo reference with extreme 
scrutiny before making a single mark. We must make it part of our artistic tool box to learn to see photo 
distortion firstly, then other problems as we go, such as focal depth, meaning the difference between how 
we focus our vision to see depth compared to how the camera sees depth.
2 The Slave Betrayed
Analyse the photo reference with me as I draw. Let’s start with 
our attention level set to high. Using a small two-finger wide 
piece of charcoal I lay in basic proportions. Aware of the lens 
distortion noted above I continue to examine and correct pro-
portion as I go. I don’t need to measure, it’s mostly a matter 
of what ‘feels’ right. Learning to see and constant life drawing 
with our binocular vision will attune us to seeing real-world 
shapes and proportions. I see the far leg (C) is so foreshortened 
it looks amputated. This is a major fix. 
I also bring the thigh forward to both create more rhythm with-
in the figure and to show more of the far leg. I draw the thigh 
using natural foreshortening. Our own eyes see objects shorten 
as they come toward us but not to the degree of a camera lens.  
Now all of this fixation on proportion my seem like I’m overly 
concerned with correct proportion, but it’s not that, as I will 
often push proportion for effect. What I’m changing is the me-
chanical mistakes of the camera lens so they don’t show in my 
drawing and betray me to the world as a slave to the camera.

3 Drawing with Rhythm
Once again I look to real world proportions for guidance. On a standing figure we are basically two heads 
long down to the nipples. Even allowing for natural foreshortening I needed to draw the head bigger and 
wider. In real life Katy has a heart-shaped face, yet in the photo she appears to have a long face. Professional 
portrait painters in particular usually draw sketches from life first when they intend to work from photos of 
their subject to be aware of distortion. Learning to see and learning to draw are essential skills for a painter.
By starting with basic shapes it’s easier to draw more sophisticated lines on top. I’ve drawn the face using 
small shapes inside a big shape. This is two of my disciplines in action at once: Big to Small and Simple to 
Sophisticated. Note the gestural pencil grip in action. Drawing with our gestural hand we use the rhythm of 
our entire arm rather than the stifled wrist movement of our writing grip.
4 A Tilt of the Head
On closer inspection what appears to be a foot (A) is actually the ankle twisting. In reality we would simply 
tilt our head to see and understand this in 3D space. We need to inspect every anomaly within a 2D image 
such as a photo. I decide to draw the classic shape of a foot to make the drawing more clear. I’m improving 
what I see in terms of artistic mark making. Note also how many times I exaggerate the curves to make the 
drawing more lively using the gestural pencil grip. The gestural grip allows the freedom to draw long fluid 
lines from a multitude of angles.

5 An Odd Drawing
At this stage I step back from the art to check the drawing has solid structure. I lay in broad tones with my 
charcoal. Remember, our main goal here is to interpret the reference. If we gauge success on how close we 
copy we will end up with a stiff drawing that looks like a distorted photo. As stated in the introduction, 
people will forgive a distorted photo but will see a distorted drawing as wrong. As a learning experience it’s 
worth tracing on top of this photo to compare it to the adjusted drawing to understand how strange camera 
distortion becomes evident when transformed into traced lines. The tracing will be an odd drawing.
6 A More Interesting Drawing
Up until this point I’ve juggled the fluid nature of gesture and the solid discipline of structure. It’s an OK 
drawing at this point, but nothing stylish. This is the journey person stage, from which we can now stamp 
our personal style onto. Using tissue I blend tone into form, this also fades the drawing allowing me a second 
chance to draw better on top. This is an interesting point to consider: The camera, unlike our eye, has a depth 
of focus that over sharpens edges and also over blurs out of focus edges. Our human eye has a depth of focus 
that sees sharp edges without the next edge butting right up in equal focus. In real life If I focused on Katy’s 
face at this distance her hips would be less sharp, but not blurred. In a drawing I use softer lines and broken 
lines to give the impression of this idea.
Note how even the difference in line darkness has already made the drawing more interesting and less heavy 
handed. This is the first indication of a drawing approaching an artist’s personal style, rather than a drawing 
as a documentation. Style need not be a wild abstraction, which it can be; for me style is the recognisable 
hand of the artist who draws with thought, rather than one who simply copies.

7 A Small Investment
Here I’m making small structural adjustments and adding more tonal gestures with charcoal and finger 
smudging, considering those softer lines and edges as the forms turn. We tend to see more tone than the 
camera and so our forms should not ‘burn out’ as quickly approaching light. Note how sharp Katy’s hips are 
in the photo against the dark background. 
Adding broken lines and tone adds vigour to the drawing and freshens it up, giving it a more painterly qual-
ity. It also helps us feel the drawing as a holistic idea rather than a bits and pieces idea. This second time 
around goes quickly, just a matter of minutes, which is a small investment for an hour long drawing. From 
this point onward my quest is to further explore style in the drawing and begin the process of breaking away 
from the photo source for reference.
8 All That Matters
I use shadows to push the gesture but in a considered choice I omit the shadow of the Xiphoid Process ( the 
small bone under the pointed arch of the ribcage ). It looks odd here, and even though it’s correct it violates 
one of my art laws: ‘If it looks wrong, it’s wrong, even if it’s right!’ The drawing is all that matters in the 
end— not what we see exactly, or the correct proportions—only the drawing.

9 Stumpy Fingers
Using a paper stump I push around the charcoal already on the paper rather than lay more charcoal down. 
This keeps the drawing light and fresh. I’m also mindful to always be drawing even when blending. To keep 
from smudging the drawing I use a sheet of paper, this also stops the oil from our skin leaving marks on the 
drawing. I also keep my hands dirty with charcoal as this also prevents oil transfer and allows me to draw 
and smudge with my fingers. You can also use surgical gloves if you like and use various-sized paper stumps 
to blend with, whatever works for you. For me finger blending is the most natural way to work, followed by 
the more precise paper stump blending.
10 Our Photo Friend
I ‘draw’ highlights with a kneadable eraser. I think of the eraser as a drawing tool rather than a correction 
tool. Photography can be our friend in finding highlights that may be hard to detect. Photoshop and even 
apps on our ipads have features to enhance contrast. Old paper book cover artists would have their refer-
ence images overexposed and also underexposed to see all the tones that might be tricky to see in the master 
photo. The danger here is to lean to much on one or the other. The master ‘original’ photo is still the main 
go-to for the final drawing. 
Slowly does it, especially in the early stages. I believe drawing faster than our thoughts is a false economy – If 
we rush a drawing we inevitably spend most of our time fixing mistakes. Every mark should be a thought.

11 The Bug Bears
I take a short coffee break away from the drawing and come back with a fresh eye. A break helps me see the 
bug bears more clearly when I return. Bug Bears is the term I use for elements in the picture that bug me. 
Sometimes I don’t know exactly what the problem is, sometimes I do and refer to notes I make as I work re-
garding what needs fixed. A break will normally help me see problems that weren’t clear when I was too close 
to the work, meaning I was so busy working on individual elements that the holistic nature of the drawing 
was suffering. 
Another thing to be aware of with photographs is that we are looking at a frozen moment in time when 
gravity may not yet have taken its full course of action during the model’s movement into the pose. I see the 
breasts are too close in shape, this may be a moment when the breasts had not fully re-formed into a more 
natural shape during the click of the shutter lens. The lower rib cage looks too smooth due to reflected light. 
I make minor changes to both bug bears and am ready for the big finish.
12 Killing Two Birds
I lay down a large swath of charcoal using a tissue. Jars of charcoal dust can be bought from art stores but I 
simply dab the tissue on my sandpaper block which is always thick with dust from my constant pencil sharp-
ening, this also cleans the sandpaper block which is a satisfying way to kill two birds with one stone. I then 
smudge and tonk (dab) the applied charcoal with both the tissue and also a shammy leather cloth, playing 
with textures as I go. The tissue creates harder edged marks than the softer shammy. A paper kitchen-towel 
will give us even harder edged marks. Between the three we can get unique textures. I learned of the shammy 
from Glen Vilppu a few years back and it has been part of my drawing arsenal ever since. Here I use it for 
abstract marks to ‘ground’ the figure and add style.

13 The Elements of Fantasy
I usually give the model a story to work with, but for this photoshoot I asked Katy to transition from one 
pose to another using her emotions based on my prompts. Fear, horror, loss, anger, loneliness were some of 
the emotional word prompts used to bring out a constant stream of poses that transitioned into an spiritual 
ballet. From this moment onward I take the pose further and imagine a vampire in a blood-lust trance. With 
large charcoal sticks I draw abstract shapes to create a magical dark mood. I push the hair up into the night 
air as if it has a life of its own. I then pencil in the breast plates and jewelry using hard erasers for highlights. 
The variance in line width throughout the figure takes our eye on a liquid journey over the undulating forms, 
creating a sense of movement even within a still image.
14 The Distrustful Friend
I stop referencing the photo completely, beautiful though it is. For if we continue referring the photo as 
being ‘correct’ we might believe every change is a mistake. I finish the drawing with gestural freedom. We 
must learn to separate the photo-reference from the drawing—as the drawing must stand alone. Look only 
at the drawing now and you will see the artist’s style come through due to choices of line, tone, proportion, 
light and dark, all based on the very decisions to change and move beyond the photo-reference that was our 
initial source of inspiration. The photo, we must remember, is not our enemy, just a companion that tells us 
lies once in a while.

o we end our first workshop with a drawing which, although, resembles the photograph ref-
erence as the same basic pose, is now a world apart as far as it’s emotional reach extends. If I 
was to show only the photograph as the final result of my artist collaboration with Katy the 
conversation would tend toward the lighting and what a marvelous model Katy is, and that would 
pretty much be it. If I were to only show the drawing the conversation would explode in all manner 
of directions. “Who was the mysterious model that posed for this creature of the night, she must have 
been amazing to work with?’ ‘She was indeed!’ I would reply, but there would be so much more to 
discuss. ‘What does the title mean?’, ‘Is she changing into a vampire via her trance?’, ‘What happens 
next in the story?’.
Study now the difference between the photo and the finished drawing. I have made notes to give a 
rudimentary idea of some stylistic choices made during the process. These are a good go-to if you 
are starting out but they are not hard-and-fast rules, just a beginning. Some techniques I find lift the 
art out of the mundane, such as bringing reflected light into the shadows, but sometimes I darken a 
shadow that is too light to be more like the photo-reference, it depends what the rest of the drawing 
looks like in relationship to the shadow.
We began with a photo and we fought the lies it told us and rejoiced in the frozen image conjured. It 
gave  us the ability to study the figure for a long period of time without the model shifting position, 
a feat impossible in reality. It is our friend and foe all wrapped up in a miraculous paradox.
The fact that the final process ends with a drawing rather than a traced image means the artist has 
invested further thought and emotion into the art, far beyond the photoshoot, so far that the photo 
is no longer involved in the process. The drawing now has a life of its own. The photo remains in its 
own unique place as a documented memory of time, but the art has gained an eternal quality due to 
the fact the viewer can interpret their own stories based on the image. The drawing may have stirred 
the imagination of the viewer, but now they have something more personal, they have ownership. 
I’ve studied Frank Frazetta’s ‘Egyptian Queen’ so many times over the years I’m certain I’ve spent 
more time looking at it than the time it took Frank to paint it. I own it and I own the stories I imag-
ined based on it, they are mine to treasure. Frank started a conversation that is eternal and belongs to 
us all. What a gift! This is what makes art magical.

n our flat paper surface we can only draw across two di-
mensions, we can draw up and down, left and right, but 
we obviously can’t draw ‘inside’ the flat paper, for therein 
lies the impossible third dimension of depth. Yet, that doesn’t mean 
we can’t create an ‘illusion’ of the third dimension.
It was the illusion of the third dimension that first drew gasps of 
amazement when the Old Masters such as Rembrandt and Cara-
vaggio displayed their huge oil painted masterworks to the public. 
Imagine those times when photography and cinema didn’t exist, 
then imagine a giant canvas filled with heroic figures, painted with 
the illusion of 3D space. Having stood in front of these giant paint-
ings myself I can attest to the fact that you can almost feel it’s pos-
sible to step inside the canvas. This was not only the height of visual 
entertainment centuries ago - to the average person it was a feat of 
magic!
Using charcoals and pencils make the illusion of depth a harder task 
to fulfill as we don’t have the benefit of colour and glazes, and in 
most cases scale, as pencil drawings are usually a small affair, but it 
can still be done. 
In this workshop we will explore the world of illusion and endeav-
our through line and tone to trick the eye into believing we are look-
ing at beyond a flat surface.

2  Vague Shapes
To give the pose more movement I 
tilt the shoulders toward the higher 
hip. The shoulders will naturally 
tilt with the ribcage but because 
the scapulae (the wing bones of the 
upper back) work independently 
this can change. Using a small 
piece of willow charcoal I also pull 
the right arm out a little to give the 
pose a more quirky feel. 
Note the sacrum triangle above 
the gluteal divide, this is a central 
landmark to look for as it indicates 
the end of the spine and the begin-
ning of the hips. As the hips are 
fused they can only tilt and twist. 
The sacrum and its dimples are the 
cornerstone to look for to begin 
our structure. In photographs shot 
straight ahead the sacrum and 
its dimples can be hard to find. I 
recommend paying special atten-
tion to this area in life drawing and 
shifting to a position where you 
can see the sacrum shape from the 
side. This we can’t do with a photo, 
but constant study will help use 
see these vague shapes as I have 
indicated in our photo here.
Placing the sacrum gives us a 
landmark to line up the hip bones 
and gluteal bottom. The top 
corners will often show as dimples 
where we can run an imaginary 
line that informs the tilt of the 
hips. Once we have the hip tilt we 
have an imaginary box form to 
work within, making the complex 
structure of the hips a simple idea 
to begin with.

oday we will draw Alana, with 
focus on the gluteus while 
creating depth using tonal value. I 
have added to the task by choosing 
a photo with very little foreshort-
ening in it. Apart from the foot 
coming at us the limbs, torso and 
head are roughly within the flatter 
2D planes: left to right and up and 
down.
To create the illusion of depth we 
work with a few ideas. Firstly we 
need to think like a sculptor and 
draw the body as if it’s a dimen-
sional landscape of overlapping 
forms with a sense of weight and 
volume. To achieve this we work 
with tonal value, from the darkest 
value ‘black’, toward the lightest 
value ‘white’. In this case the white 
value is the bare paper.
As usual I begin with simple 
shapes, big to small, taking time 
to assess how I will construct the 
drawing before I make a mark. 
Always be on high alert in the 
early stages as there is no point 
in rendering a badly constructed 
drawing. 
   
1 Feeling the Pinch
Although this looks like a sym-
metrical stance, the hips are tilted 
downwards to the right and the 
ribcage to the left. Look to the 
left side pinch of the waist for the 
clue. The hips are a fused mass, so 
the tilt affects each side. The pinch 
indicates the oblique muscles bulg-
ing between the ribcage and the 
hips.

The Butterfly Effect
3 The Butterfly Effect
I explore the body landscape, feeling the 
depth of flesh, as if drawing in the third 
dimension. Drawing the corners of the 
gluteus as I would a box, but with softer 
edges help clarify the idea. Note the back 
side of the gluteal masses resemble an 
upside down butterfly. This is a visual 
clue, known as a Mnemonic, which 
helps me not make the mistake of mak-
ing the upper gluteus and lower gluteus 
equal sized volumes. The lower gluteal 
masses are called the Gluteus Maximus 
for good reason.
4 The Power of Illusion
With everything in place I add some 
grayscale tone with the broad side of my 
charcoal. The tone immediately adds a 
sense of volume to our illusion of the 
third dimension. I’m keeping everything 
light to begin with in order to have the 
freedom to change shapes and tones 
before going into detail.

5 Think like a Sculptor
There’s now enough charcoal on the 
newsprint surface for me to shape the 
flesh using my fingers alone. I’m think-
ing like a sculptor. This makes the illu-
sion of flesh softer and fades the image. 
With the image faded I now have a less 
confusing drawing to put line on top of.
6 The Paper Solution
I use a scrap piece of newsprint to stop 
from smudging the charcoal as I draw. 
I could use re-workable spray fixative at 
this stage to hold the charcoal but it can 
make erasing highlights difficult later. 
The paper solution leaves my erasing 
options open as long as possible as well 
as making it easier to smudge, fade, and 
redraw lines.
Here I’m drawing the area of the great 
trochanter bone (ball of the femur) at the 
widest part of the hips.

7 Murky Areas
Alternating between finger smudging 
and penciling I work from dark to light 
tones to find further illusions of depth. 
Within photographic images we tend to 
find murky areas which we can’t simply 
brighten with a light switch, so we need 
to know our anatomy should we decide 
to bring those unseen areas into light. I 
decide to pull the standing leg inward 
more before detailing. Remember: the 
early stages are the least painful time to 
make changes.
8 Improving the Drawing
By adjusting the leg in the last step the 
figure is more solidly balanced. I was 
lucky to spot the opportunity for change 
before I added heavier line work, which 
is more difficult to erase. 
Every stage is a new opportunity to re-
think and improve the drawing based on 
the photo (or live model), interpreting 
what we see rather than copying without 
thought.

9 The Shapeshifter
I continue to smudge into the flesh 
until I have a good mid-tone to pull out 
highlights with my kneadable eraser. By 
reshaping the pliable kneadable eraser as 
I go I can vary the shape making. I think 
of my erasers as drawing tools rather 
than mistake-fixers.
I don’t fear the hard edged marks the 
kneadable eraser makes as I’m thinking 
ahead to the next blending stage. Note 
how dark the eraser is. A dirty eraser is 
more subtle eraser and leaves less gummy 
marks.
10 A light Touch
With a pencil eraser I ‘draw’ the brightest 
highlights. On flesh extreme highlights 
are usually found on oily parts of the 
skin such as the nose and forehead, but 
also where flesh gets pinched. The pencil 
eraser also has a brush on the end for 
sweeping erased particles.

11 Black Magic
Now I work into the absolute darks to 
get further dimension. The darkest darks 
will be in the occlusion shadows, where 
flesh meets flesh, such as in the creases 
of the gluteus and arms. I also add some 
energetic strokes here to bring back my 
gestural hand, which can become stiff, in 
the ‘drawing’ sense of the word, after a 
lot of structural drawing. Abstract marks 
are one of the strengths an artist has 
over the camera, which, beyond captur-
ing light, has no real thought process to 
speak of.
12 The Mysterious
To finish I tame the strokes down and 
shape them with my smudgy fingers, 
erasers and tissue to create a mystical 
swirl.  What is the mysterious ‘Entity’ in 
the title? Well, I’ll leave that up to your 
imagination as I like my drawings to be 
open to interpretation. Leaving mystery 
creates a connection between the artist 
and the viewer.

he term Contrapposto means counterpoise, or counterbalance, and refers to a 
figure balanced with most weight on one side, usually the straight-leg side of the 
body, in a standing pose. 
The most famous contrapposto artwork is probably Michelangelo’s statue of David sculpt-
ed between 1501 and 1504. Incredibly Michelangelo was a mere 26 years old when he 
started chipping into that massive 17ft block of marble!
The earliest example of contrapposto can be traced back to the ‘Kritios Boy’ sculpted 
around 480BC. Before Kritios figures were usually symmetrical or flat graphics such as the 
hieroglyphics found in ancient Egyptian temples. I guess it took a long time for a relaxed 
pose to be taken seriously.
What is it that makes counter-balanced figures in art so appealing? For me it’s the fluid 
asymmetry. When we are counterbalanced we are in a state of flux. I’ve stared up into the 
eyes of counterbalanced greek statues in silence and could understand how bygone people 
believed they saw them move, or even speak, long ago in those ancient temples.
Artists starting out usually find photographic reference poses in magazines or on the inter-
net, but with phones becoming cheaper and pixel resolution getting stronger we can now 
take our own reference shots. The cheapest models are our friends and ourselves. In this 
workshop I will use myself as a model as I have done since the start of my career. All we 
need when using the world’s cheapest model is a friend to  take the shot, or a self-timer, 
an understanding of rhythmic balance, and a sense of the dramatic.

2 Begin the Sanguine
For this drawing I’m using a 
sanguine pastel pencil on toned 
paper. Sanguine means ‘blood’ and 
sanguine pencils can range be-
tween dark brown to almost pink. 
I’ve chosen a dark sanguine and a 
warm, midtone paper. To find the 
right tone just match the paper to 
the basic midtone of your pencil. 
The midtone doesn’t need to be 
exact, just close. The paper will 
now represent the midtone of the 
figure. 
As usual I start with basic shapes, 
then identify the weight bearing 
straight leg and tilt the shoulder 
toward it for more balance, then 
I tilt the head toward the higher 
shoulder. This is the ideal balance, 
but as with the statue of David I 
am holding and object which tilts 
the shoulders a little toward the re-
laxed leg, which throws us off from 
the ideal contrapposto tilt. Tricky, 
but common to see.
I usually err on the side of a small-
er head rather than a bigger head. 
A smaller head is more heroic as 
it makes the figure more majestic, 
whereas a big head can look comi-
cal—though a tiny head will also 
look comical. 
It’s relatively easy to enlarge a 
head that’s too small by adding to 
the jaw or top of the head, but to 
make a very big head smaller we 
will have most likely need to draw 
all the features such as lips and 
eyes smaller, and that’s a big fix. 
In that case it would be a better, 
and fresher choice, to redraw again 
from scratch.
T
oday we will draw a male 
figure in contrapposto. To 
fill in for Michelangelo’s David I 
will employ my most reliable male 
model. He’s always on time and I 
pay him with simple foods such as 
cheese. A great deal for both of us.
I’ve measured myself in heads and 
come in at around seven and three 
quarter heads high (head includ-
ed), which is close to the average 
proportion of seven and a half 
heads high. You can see basic land-
marks: the bottom of head two 
lands just above the nipple and the 
bottom of head three just below 
the navel. The bottom of head four 
hits the ideal half way mark of the 
great trochanter (hip bone) and 
the bottom of head six lands just 
below the tibial nose. 
An ideal division is eight heads 
which would line those major 
landmarks up evenly, which is 
what David appears to be. I ex-
pected maybe less as he has a large 
head, but he has a long femur. 
I have a small head and at first 
glance I expected I might be eight 
heads too, but I have a shorter 
femur. The point is everyone is 
slightly different. Although we can 
vary greatly in height most of us 
are close in basic proportion.
1 Always on Time
Look closely at my hand and you 
will see I’m holding a remote timer 
button to take the shot. Place a full 
length mirror next to your camera 
and you are ready to pose.

3 An Individual Style
I draw smaller shapes inside the big sim-
ple shapes. Note how I treat the rhythm 
of the legs, drawing from one side to the 
other. Study how the knees have a low, 
overlapping curve on the inside and how 
the calves are high on the outside. This 
is the natural rhythm of the body. Look 
back and forth at the photo and draw-
ing to see the micro changes I make as 
I go. They may not all be for the better, 
but each decision adds to my individual 
style, and also keeps me interested and 
constantly thinking, which by it’s very 
nature makes the drawing more vigorous 
rather than a stiff copy.
4 Ghosting the Image
I’m using a high grade pastel art paper. 
Pastel paper has a smooth and a rough 
side, I choose the smooth side, but it still 
has a ’tooth’, meaning it has micro pits 
that hold the pastel pigment. I blend 
with tissue to smooth the pigment into 
the grain and also to ghost the image 
back.

5 Get out of Jail Free
I stand back from the art and see with a 
fresh eye that the head needs to be slight-
ly bigger. I add to the skull and that’s all 
that’s required, it’s a simple tip to try that 
will save us re-sizing all the features of 
the face. As long as we are not drawing a 
portrait likeness this is a good ‘get out of 
jail free’ card. The great thing about us-
ing photos is we can quickly reduce them 
in size to see the basic proportions better, 
rather than have to walk to the back of 
the life draw class.
Happy with the new head size and basic 
proportions I start detailing the anatomy.
 
6 Don’t be Stumped
I blend the edges with a paper stump, 
improving as I go by reshaping and 
pushing the pigment around. I keep two 
sets of paper stumps and kneadable eras-
ers, one set for sanguine and one set for 
charcoal so as not to dirty my drawings. 
Always be thinking as you render and 
your drawing will reflect your inner feel-
ings and energy in every mark.
52

7
7 A Simple Plan
As with the blending stump I use the 
eraser with the same mind-set, and 
think of it as a drawing tool. Kneadable 
erasers are pliable and can be moulded 
and shaped to pull out highlights. Note 
how the knees are changing from simple 
shapes into something more sophisti-
cated. Simple to complex is the best ap-
proach. A good tip for knees is to imag-
ine an ice cream cone to begin with, this 
will represent the patella and its ligament
8 The Same Squint
Keeping a piece of paper under my hand, 
as I soften edges with tissue, prevents 
oil transferring to the paper. Natural oil 
from our hands can be invisible then 
appear as blots when we blend pigment 
later. No big deal on a textured back-
ground but it could spoil the flawless 
skin tone you had hoped for.
To find the mass shapes of shadow and 
light simply quint at the photo as you 
would in life class.

9 The Big Crowd Pleaser
It’s been a long time coming but here it 
is, the white pastel pencil for the high-
lights. Make sure the drawing is strong 
structurally and gesturally as the white 
effect should not be a crutch to prop up 
a poor drawing. It’s also important not to 
mix the sanguine with the white. Since 
the midtone paper represents the mid-
tone flesh there is no logical reason for 
the highlights to reach the dark tones. 
This can be tricky as we sometimes have 
to butt the highlights up against the 
darkest areas where flesh compresses. 
Take care as white and sanguine mixed 
create an unpleasant pink colour that 
screams ‘Amateur!’.
10 Blend and Push
Using all my tools I blend and push the 
white pigment into the surface. Note 
how fleshy everything has become based 
on three simple values; the darks of the 
sanguine, the midtown of the paper and 
the highlights of the white. I use the 
pencil eraser with the brush end a lot 
in sanguine drawing for brushing away 
eraser debris.
56

11 The Dreaded Pink
Time to address the small stuff and 
explore the beauty of anatomy and form. 
Constant study of the knees is important 
as everyone’s knees are different due to 
variable ‘bursa’ shapes, which are little 
fatty pads that protect the joints. Note 
I’m using a clean paper stump to avoid 
the dreaded pink tone while blending 
whites.
12 Spinning Rubber
Using a mono eraser pencil I thin some 
of the line widths. I also use an electric 
eraser, as shown her, to add textures and 
erase stubborn areas. Test the electric 
eraser on a scrap piece of paper first as it 
can run across your drawing if you are 
caught unawares by its spinning rubber. 
Pastel paper is wonderful to work with, 
but due to the grain it’s a fight to get 
thin lines when working on a relatively 
small scale. Ideally this drawing would be 
easier to work with at twice this size, but 
there are always work-arounds.
58

I 
title the piece, ‘The Tracker’ based on the stories of indigenous warriors who were em-
ployed by occupying forces to track down their own people. This happened the world 
over as colonial might took control. Having a back story, theme, emotion, or symbolism 
within our drawings gives adds depth. Betrayal is a strong theme in my art due to the 
desperation and heartache it evokes, and it connects strongly to every viewer as we have 
all felt betrayed in our lives at some point.
Making marks with erasers, tissue and paper stumps for background texture draw the eye 
to the contrasting tones of the smooth skin. Sanguine on toned paper is slow, but worth 
the effort. I probably spent three hours or more pushing and blending into the grainy 
surface. 
I tone down the whites with tissue and paper stumps to take away the metallic look that 
can sneak up on the over zealous artist who has become seduced by the eye-popping effect 
of dimension. The less white we use the more timeless the image will be. My advice is to 
take out as much as possible and keep it concentrated in the areas we want the viewer to 
see, which will be the focus we consider most important. Note how there is less and less 
white the further we travel down the body. This keeps the focus on the torso and head. 
Looking back on this drawing I would, with hindsight, take away all the highlights on 
the face. This would make the metal headdress read more as jewelry and would also add 
mystery to the shrouded face.
One of the reasons I think  some artists are just that bit better than most is in the care 
given to the final moments. I almost always leave a drawing overnight before sending 
it off to a collector or publisher as we tend not to see the flaws during the battle. Some 
drawings viewed the next day can be littered with errors that just weren’t visible the day 
before. This is known as seeing with a ‘fresh eye’. Turn the drawing upside down, or look 
at it in a mirror to find even more adjustments we could make. Allowing some time away 
from the art then spending a few minutes, or even hours, improving line, tone and details 
can turn an OK work into an exceptional piece of art that will stand the test of time. Take 
some extra time and thought over your drawings and you will be rewarded.

rawings are usually a series of lines on a flat surface and ex-
ist without movement. How can we possibly suggest mo-
tion based on this premise? We can add tonal values and 
overlapping forms to trick the eye into seeing an illusion of depth, 
but an illusion of movement is usually the domain of animators 
working with multiple drawings flickering past at a speed that sug-
gests we are no longer looking at a series of static images, but at 
actual moving images.
Animators may have the ultimate answer in making drawings come 
alive in the mind’s eye, but we also have the tools to suggest move-
ment in a static drawing. We may be working with a still image but 
by using the power of gestural lines and rhythmic strokes we can 
create the impression of life and movement within a single image. 
Another method to suggest movement, and even chaos, is to throw 
the figure off balance. With contrapposto we explored the beauty of 
balance using one side of the body as the support and leaving the 
other side relaxed, using the asymmetry to create life and energy. We 
can push the idea of energy created from asymmetry by forcing the 
figure off balance or to have a figure fall or fly.
Another powerful tool in the quest for movement in drawing is the 
gestural rhythms found in foreshortened figures 
In this workshop I will delve deep into these methods to project 
movement onto the static two dimensional surface we have chosen 
as our artistic domain.

oday we will draw Alana, with focus on the torso and breasts, particularly on how the breasts 
change shape due to compression and gravity. 
On first impression these simple forms look easy to draw, and for that reason they are often drawn 
poorly. A common mistake is treating them as solid globes, instead of shape-shifting mounds that 
move, fall, bob, and flatten out. Another common error is drawing them as if both are facing front 
like a pair of eyes, when in fact each breast sits on the curve of the ribcage. I have chosen this pose to 
demonstrate the changing shape of the breasts due to their shifting weight against a solid rib cage, and 
the pull of gravity, evident even on a young woman in peak physical shape.
Apart from drawing the illusion of soft flesh against a hard surface we will also deal with relationships 
of form. Although the ribcage expands when we breathe, the hips and ribcage are basically solid, with 
all the twisting done by the abdominals and obliques (the waist side muscles). These hard shapes 
against soft shapes cause pinching flesh, most noticeably at the waist.
I believe learning proportions is important for the figurative artist but I don’t see it as an inflexible 
rule, especially when drawing from photos. Note how long the arms appear though the camera’s eye 
as the first obvious measurement to attend to. As always I measure the forms by eye, analysing their 
shapes against each other, their boxed or tubular nature, drawing the biggest shapes first. With a twist-
ing form we will have a longer side being stretched and a shorter side being compressed. This is due to 
the incredible flexibility of the abdominals and the obliques. Measuring on the pinch side of the figure 
is easier where shapes are closer together and spaces are shorter, for instance notice the difference in 
stretch and pinch distance indicated by the arrow lengths from the top of the breasts to the top of the 
lateral portions of the hip crests indicated in the photo.
If we keep all these ideas in mind as we draw we will create a fluid figure that still feels like it is made 
of flesh and bone, but more importantly we will draw a figure that gives the impression of a living, 
breathing being that looks as if it’s ready to move gracefully into another position. When I approach 
this moment of grace and fluidity in a drawing I think of it as a state of ‘Stillness in Motion’.

hen it comes to drawing the figure I think of how the basic structures work together. Making 
structural drawings such as this one helps me understand how everything locks together. Learn-
ing to see structure as a form of simplified anatomy is key to drawing with confidence.
Before the photoshoot I sit with Alana and discuss our planned shoot. Having already communicated 
via email we have a good idea of where to go artistically. I had sent lots of ideas regarding  mood such 
as photos from surrealists and experimental artists and dancers, and Alana added her own collection 
of interesting ideas and emotional themes. Although we are seeking inspiration we are keen to ex-
trapolate on themes that have gone before rather than repeating ideas verbatim, in fact seeking out the 
past is a good way to make sure we don’t do something that has been done before. It’s amazing how 
many ‘original’ concepts we think we came up with only to find they have already been explored and 
exhausted to artistic death.
I decide on ‘Creation’ as the motivating theme. To make sure we create a fresh adaptation on the idea 
I call out; cruelty, spite, anger, joy, elation, while Alana moves from one pose to another. As fun and 
’Austin Powers-like’ as this may sound, it works. With this sorcery pose Alana becomes a raging sym-
bol of creation.
I draw lightly using a small piece of willow charcoal. As usual I treat the photo with deep suspicion. 
I adjust the long arms and the head feels a little small. I want the body to be flying rather than lying 
over a support, therefore I lengthen the foreshortened midsection.

ith our motivational theme of creation in place I think on what kind of creature Alana is as 
I draw. She can fly without wings and therefore must be a supernatural being rather than a 
winged fantasy figure from another world. I decide she is a witch conjuring spells and name the draw-
ing ‘The Wake of the Black Witch’. With a title and motivation the drawing gains a driving force. 
From here on I can build further on the theme and the title. A ship creates a wake in the water as it 
churns though the waves and I imagine what kind of wake a witch would make in space and time as 
she conjures her black magic and how that would manifest itself as energy. A task to ponder on as I 
draw the form and feed off the energy of the pose for further inspiration regarding gesture and life.
Having an artistic collaborator rather than a posed model is what brings life to my drawings, a life they 
would not have if my model was merely a mannequin to be posed joint-by-joint. For this reason I no 
longer stick religiously to production sketches, in fact I now make my sketches more abstract to al-
low further freedom of interpretation. With Alana free to express the overall theme without worrying 
about every limb meeting contact points we have a fluidity uncommon in life drawing poses. From 
this point it’s up to me to add additional life, which I will do with the overlapping forms created by 
foreshortening. As a figure comes toward us forms overlap, such as the breasts in front of the hill of 
the ribcage, and the hill of the ribcage in front of the abdominals. Foreshortening by its overlapping 
nature creates rhythm not found so easily in a standing figure.
Here I’m marking out angles as I would for my live figure drawing classes, such as the high and low 
relationships of the forearms and the oblong width of the head. I’ve also bent Alana’s right arm to add 
more curve to the straightness, implying more of a conjuring gesture as she flies through space.

sing my fingers I smudge tones around using the charcoal already laid down on the newsprint 
paper then refine a little with a paper stump. Here we see the transition between the underdraw-
ing and the next stage of refinement. It’s important in the early stages to keep the drawing light as this 
method allows for changes. I’m chasing the echoes of similar forms as I go, blending nature’s rhythmic 
shapes down the body. With the structural proportions pretty much nailed down I move forward with 
line quality and gesture in mind, which is the life of the thing. From here onward we are on a quest 
to escape from structural hell and attain the nirvana of gestural heaven, especially with a flying figure, 
which needs to convey gestural elegance.
I step back from the drawing and take time to evaluate before committing to darker lines. I feel the 
overall drawing has solidity, and more importantly, a sense of movement. I lay in darker lines placing 
a sheet of paper under my hand to keep the surface clean. Using the broad side of the pencil dropped 
low gives me a thicker line. Rolling my cupped gestural hand up onto its fingers and down onto its 
knuckles allows me ultimate freedom of expression in line and tone. 
Another disciple is the pressure required to blend light and dark tone. I recommend lots of mark 
making on a blank piece of newsprint paper before starting a drawing. With practice we build a sub-
conscious art engine that fuels our drawings. Once again I am aware of the hyper crisp edges that pho-
tography creates compared to the less contrasting edges we see with our eyes. Take a photo of a glass  
of water on a table then compare the photo to the same glass of water on a table with your own eyes, 
you will see harder edges in the photo, often with a crisp light edge after a dark edge. These are optical 
artifacts within the camera’s lens. With that in mind I thin the line along the hip to soften the edge.

I 
continue adding line and tone down the body, moving from side to side as I go, always aware of 
what one arm is doing as I draw the other, never myopically zoomed into one area, which is one 
of the big traps when working with photos. I resist zooming in until the final details, at which point 
photo-reference becomes our friend, as we can’t zoom in on a live model. 
It’s important not to be drawing in ‘parts’ as this will lead us into structural hell. I’m constantly aware 
of the figure as a living thing with every imbalance being counteracted in the natural flow of motion 
across anatomy. If one side is pinched at the waist, the other side will be more stretched. Our aware-
ness of the figure in its entirety from toes to fingertips will make us the boss of our art. By being aware 
we take charge of the situation, rather than flying by the seat of our pants hoping for the best.
Add gravity to the situation and the breasts change shape. See how each breast is slightly different –be-
cause they always are. Note also how the nipples change shape as the breasts stretch or flatten out. We 
are not only studying anatomy as we draw, but also the skin suit we wear, which stretches and folds 
like seamless silk. As the nipples are on top of our skin suit they change shape when stretched. Take 
time to study these ever changing forms.
A major tip is to draw the breasts after the shape of the ribcage is drawn in place, rather than draw 
them first, because the ribcage will define the shapes based on factors such as gravity pressing them 
against the hard bone surface. In this upside down view the breasts are more square shaped as they 
compress over the upper ribs, which has a flatter surface than the lower ribs where the breasts would 
normally fall.

hen drawing hands there are notes to keep in mind, for instance, the forefinger and middle 
finger take up more than half the hand’s width, and the little finger splays outward at an angle 
as it shares a carpal at the wrist with the ring finger. Drawing the outer edges of the little finger and 
thumb first makes it easier to plot and place the other fingers. A rookie error is to draw the fingers one 
at a time as we go as this usually results in a giant, misshapen hand. That said, I have watched incred-
ible artists, such as Kim Jung Gi and Eliza Ivanova, manage to draw great hands as they go, one digit 
at a time. Try and see, maybe you are a rare case of genius. For the rest of us mere mortals drawing the 
basic shape of the hand first is the best way to go.
I make the bent lower leg and foot longer to adjust for the camera distortion and also to fit my choice 
to elongate the torso. A glance back and forth between the drawing will expose how short the leg is in 
the photo-reference.
There is enough charcoal on the newsprint paper for me to blend with a paper stump and I improve 
the forms as I push the charcoal around. I also dim the torso area by lifting off some tone with tissue. 
This suggests a central light source which draws our eye down the drawing toward the face.
Our natural senses draw our eye toward light and contrast, this gives artists a powerful tool to use in 
composition. Composing with light is as important in my art as is composition of shapes. Shapes can 
be beautiful and elegant, but light and tone are atmospheric and emotional triggers. A misty day has 
it’s own unique sense as does a hazy summer day, yet they have different elemental light shifts. Let’s 
embrace all the elements of nature at our disposal.

ith photos we often draw what we see in the background without thinking of further possibili-
ties, as it’s hard not to be influenced by what’s in front of us. Here I blot texture down with 
tissue dipped in charcoal powder, moving, twisting and reshaping the tissue as I go so as not to create 
duplicate patterns. You can buy charcoal powder but I use the stuff already on the sandpaper pad left 
over from sharpening my pencils. 
Within the textures I use a kneadable eraser to pull out highlights. I ‘draw’ textures with a kneadable 
eraser reshaping it as I go just like the tissue technique. 
I also lighten the flesh. A dirty eraser creates softer highlights whereas a clean eraser will give us a 
harder edged highlight, each has its own look. If you work in a blocky style then hard highlights will 
work, but for this kind of soft blended flesh a dirty eraser is better, it also gives us the chance to pull 
out tone slowly with several ponces at a time. If the erased marks are too hard-edged we can come back 
and soften the edges with fingers, tissue, or paper stumps. 
Slowly does it, especially in the early stages. Take all the time you need to get where you need to be. 
The confidence gained due to the emerging drawing magically taking shape before our eyes never gets 
old. Drawing fast is a false economy – If we rush a drawing we inevitably spend most of our time in 
the negative world of fixing mistakes, which in turn dulls our confidence, resulting in dull artwork. 
Ironically, to draw fast we often need to slow down.

he moody chiaroscuro lighting in the photo has inspired me to darken the background. One of 
the advantages of photography is that can pose the model in a dark room then draw them in the 
light of my studio. 
Using a large compressed charcoal stick I draw large swirls, twisting the stick as I draw for thick and 
thin marks to suggest sorcery afoot. The compressed charcoal is more dense than the willow charcoal, 
as the name suggests, and for this reason it needs a light touch as the marks go down as black as night. 
This could be ruinous to the delicate work already achieved as the compressed charcoal is also more 
difficult to wipe back or erase. My advice is to practice how light and dark you can control the stick 
using one continuous stroke on a separate sheet of paper. This practice will not only be fun but it will 
make your hand more confident. When I apply the charcoal strokes I do so with the ultimate confi-
dence as any doubt will show through with nervous mark making. Time to be brave and sure.
I engage my electric eraser to suggest crackling energy then use a Faber Castell grip eraser to change 
the swirls into more interesting shapes. I do this directly after the charcoal mark making as I still have 
the gestural nature in my hand. In other words we shouldn’t take a break between the charcoal swirls 
and the erasing alterations, it should be done in one sitting. 
Note how the figure appears visibly brighter now. This is mostly due to the darkened background and 
less to do with the small amount of highlight erasing on the figure since the previous step. This chiar-
oscuro light brings the black witch back into focus.

ith smudgy fingers, thumbs and tissue I make the swirls more gestural, then using a kneadable 
eraser and grip eraser I further reshape them. Finally I carry the swirls upward with compressed 
charcoal. I have darkened the bent lower leg along the way to further highlight the upper torso. We 
are working with light as composition here as our eye will naturally track from the dimly lit foot down 
toward the more contrasting torso. The lighting in the photo has helped immensely here by guiding 
the atmosphere, so it’s not all bad news on the camera front.
Putting in the small stuff of detail is always a danger as we tend to tinker and lose sight of the big 
overall picture. I’m feeling it’s time to stop before the drawing suffers. Was this drawing better the step 
before? Perhaps, but no one will ever see that stage, unless you write a book like this one or post prog-
ress shots on the internet. Had I not pushed further I may not have discovered the atmosphere created 
in fading the hair into inky blackness. By constantly exploring we get to understand more and will 
learn to feel the moment of completion in future artworks. As always mileage, the act of drawing lots, 
will not only build our memory muscles, it will also inform our general awareness of when a drawing 
is finished, or close to finished. 
When I look back at my progress stages I would say most of my drawings tip past their best moment, 
but those best moments may never have happened had I not always chased a dream of better line and 
tone, to seek out emotional depth with story, atmospheric and light, in the quest to create the ever 
elusive ‘masterpiece’.

n our workshops we have explored the balance of contrapposto, the rhythm of asym-
metry, the illusion of depth, and all the time we were working with the biggest illusion 
of all, the illusion light to create an image in the mind of the viewer. In reality a draw-
ing is simply dirty marks on a flat surface arranged to fool the eye into believing it sees an 
image. In a similar manner light enters the camera’s aperture, burning light into shadow 
to create tonal forms. The aperture, that winking eye we see in the camera lens, represents 
our pupil and iris. When a room is dark the iris opens our pupils wider to let more light 
in, just as a camera’s aperture opens wider for the same reason, and when there is too much 
light our pupils shrink. The brighter the environment the less we need to open the lens of 
our eyes. 
The photo opposite is a micro second in time, a click of a button, and the opening of an 
aperture; enough time for the camera’s eye to capture the light and dark of a classroom in 
various tones to make us believe we are looking into the past. What we are really looking 
at is a memory shaped by shadow and light. There is no depth, it’s just an illusion. The 
moment we realise this we can see it’s a flat image. The people at the back are as close as 
the people in front. This is mostly due to the broad lighting of the room.
In order for us to create a drawing with depth and atmosphere we need to simplify the 
lighting and create a more focused display of light and shadow. This brings us back to 
chiaroscuro. 
Let’s explore further...

oday we will draw Alana, with focus 
on chiaroscuro. Chiaroscuro, pro-
nounced ‘keiruscuro’, is the composition of 
light and shadow to create depth, but more 
importantly, mood. Chiaroscuro creates an 
emotional atmosphere in both art and film. 
Movies that engaged us with their skillful 
play of light and dark, are sometimes re-
ferred to as Film Noir, meaning ‘dark film’, 
but their moody lighting can be seen in cen-
turies old oil paintings such as the startling, 
‘An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump’ 
by Joseph Wright, painted in 1768, which is 
housed in the National Gallery in London. 
It has to be seen in person to truly appreci-
ate the skill of the painter working in an era 
before photography was invented.
Movies with artistic light are often the col-
laborative work of a director and a cinema-
tographer. When I first watched ‘Apocalypse 
Now’ I was entranced by the cinematogra-
phy and how it created a constant mood 
flowing from one scene to the next. As an 
artist it felt to me like the emotional and ges-
tural flow through great figurative art.
There’s no need to buy an expensive lighting 
set up to create a chiaroscuro photoshoot, all 
that’s needed is a sunny day and a dark back-
ground. An old abandoned factory with a 
hole in the roof will give you the right light, 
or any indoor space with an open roof. Add 
a cell phone on a makeshift tripod and you 
can create a professional photoshoot.
And so we begin our own chiaroscuro ad-
venture of shifting emotional shadows and 
light using our humble charcoals and pen-
cils.

1 Separate Lives
Above we have our wonderful photo and pose to draw from. We can see how clearly the figure 
stands out from the background, clearly defined, dimensional and atmospheric in tone, and for 
that reason it holds our attention. This is due to the single directional light source and a dark 
uncluttered background. My lights are positioned high to recreate an artificial afternoon sun, in a 
dark studio background. One benefit of artificial light is that it’s unchanging and remains constant 
with no dimming due to passing clouds. But how can a drawing compete with such a great photo-
graph? Well, it doesn’t have to as photographs and drawings live separate lives in the world of art. 
2 Major Structures
With my willow charcoal I plot out the figure with two major structures, a long tube for the upper 
torso and a ball for the hips. Working big shapes to small I add the scapula (wing bone) and below 
the scapula I indicate the serratus and latissimus bulges as a converging ‘V’ shape.
3 Versions of Anatomy
I continue adding smaller structural shapes to define areas such as the hip bone. Structural shapes 
are simple versions of anatomy. If I were to draw the intricacies of each anatomical shape as I go 
the drawing would get so complicated that I might lose the sense of the whole figure.

4 Burning Candles
Note how the reference photo carves out the form, almost like a statue. Chiaroscuro is the most 
dimensional lighting we have to create an illusion of depth and reveals natural muscle form like 
no other light. Caravaggio would have given anything to have photography to help with his chiar-
oscuro paintings. Gone are the days when artists had to burn candles all night in order to paint a 
figure lit like this to keep the light constant after daylight ended. 
From here we begin to reap the benefits of strong structure. As I go over the drawing’s simple 
shapes again it’s easy to add smaller anatomical details such as the ribs, the sacrum pad above the 
gluteus, and the two serratus notches visible at the left of the breast.
5 Flickering Changes
I smudge the charcoal into softer forms to freshen the image and introduce tone. In life-draw 
classes I have my students step back at this stage and glance back and forth at the model until they 
see every flickering change between their drawing and the pose in order to make adjustments. 
Time spent analysing forms early, is time saved later.

6 Interlocking Forms
With all due diligence done I step back again from the art for a final assessment. This doesn’t mean 
I want exact proportions, I’m simply making sure the anatomy and interlocking forms work both 
structurally and gesturally, such as the hip crest fitting into the obliques. The chiaroscuro lighting 
makes the drawing go in fast as I’m not searching so hard for the muscle definition as I often do in 
poorly lit life draw classes. With everything working to plan I pencil on top.
7 The Magic Light
I’m strolling down easy street now as I continue penciling over my self-approved structure, or so it 
seems… in my quest to make every line more gestural I’ve made the raised scapula too rounded. 
Keep in mind that structure and gesture are a fine balance of back and forth that can fall apart at 
any time.
Now onto the subject at hand; the magical chiaroscuro. I’m thinking of the single source of light 
and how it tumbles across the forms as I blend with my fingers. To study the power of chiaroscuro 
turn any object under a desk light and observe the strong changes in light and shadow produced.

8 Sfumato
I make the shadows darker than I need so I can judge the light better. As charcoal is ‘live’ meaning 
it never ‘sets’ like paint, I can choose to lighten these darks later with a dab of soft tissue. In order 
to seal the charcoal I wait until the end before spraying a few coats of fixative. I could also choose 
to spray a light spray of re-workable fixative between stages for a drawing that can still be smudged. 
If you fix the drawing, though, it will need more push and harder erasing as the hold on the paper 
will be stronger, this will slow down the drawing and is the reason I leave it to the end.
Note the misty quality of the shadowed leg, this is called Sfumato and gives us both atmosphere 
and a clearer focus toward the more contrasting upper figure. Often what we don’t show is more 
interesting than what we do show. One of the most dangerous aspects of working from photogra-
phy is that we tend to draw every detail and miss out on the beauty of sfumato.
9 A Lighter Affair
I’ve finally addressed that pesky scapula by drawing a straight line across the upper curve. Placing 
straight lines on top of curves can add authority to a line, something I do more often on the male 
figure to add a more rugged look, but it can work on the female figure too. After a round of tis-
sue blending the drawing becomes a lighter affair. I add some head ornament with an eraser then 
pencil in detail. I could call the drawing finished at this stage, but it’s a little too bright and breezy. 
I will explore further in search of more depth, mood and atmosphere.

10 Echoing Textures
With a block of square compressed charcoal I lay in a gestural abstract background. Artists, most 
notably Rembrandt, often kept their backgrounds dark, and sometimes black, to bring the figures 
forward for the ultimate Chiaroscuro effect. The echoing texture also adds suggested movement 
to the figure.
11 The Artist’s Hand
I continue texturing the background with tissue, shammy, and kneadable eraser, turning my hand 
as I make shapes to avoid repetition. Texture not only adds interest, it can also make flesh seem 
softer by contrast. At this point I use a paper stump to soften some edges.
As long as the light comes mostly from a powerful single source the figure will appear to be carved 
from light and shadow, regardless of time or place. I call the drawing finished. The photograph, as 
incredible an asset as it was, is already a distant memory, a component that has been put aside to 
live its own life elsewhere. Look now only at the drawing. It stands alone now, a new-born creation 
of organic line, tone, and gestural energy; an energy that can only come from an artist’s hand.

oday we will do a study of the male back and arms, exploring the natural rhythm 
of muscles and the expressive nature they display as they counter-balance and 
work in union to move the body with style and grace. As someone who loves 
anatomy this is simply a beautiful thing to observe, but being an artist it also opens a 
world of possibilities, of flowing shapes, lines and rhythmic tones. 
But why do live anatomical studies when we have anatomy books to study from? The 
answer is simple: anatomy looks basically the same for everyone in a non-action pose, 
but the moment we move, the muscles change shape and affect each other as they jostle 
and push for position. In other words, muscles are shape-shifters. This is a marvellous 
thing. Add to the fact that we are all different shapes and sizes with different personali-
ties and degrees of bearing and we end up with unlimited chances for expression within 
the human figure. Look at the way a boxer moves, or even stands, compared to a bal-
lerina and you will see a world of difference in aspects of line and tone within what is 
basically the same human anatomy. 
With that said studies by nature are a notoriously slow affair, with a studied drawing 
usually ending up on the stiff side. Photos are also frozen in time, adding to stiff art if we 
stick too close to copying. This is when life drawing trumps working from photos and 
why I always recommend in my life draw classes to study the model as they move in and out of 
the pose to truly understand how the muscles shift in position.
Unfortunately I had also not drawn for a month before this assignment as I’d been in 
America for the wonderful IX show on imaginative realism, where I was giving a lecture 
on my, then, latest book, ‘Figures from Life’, which ironically is about creating gesture 
through the understanding of anatomy. 
Although I was rusty from my time away my schedule left no time for fluffing around as 
the assignment was due within days of my return, and that leads us to our next adven-
ture concerning the pearls of an artist working with rusted arms, and the value in failure.

In this photo the rhythm of life in muscle movement is evident— when we learn to see it. Note 
the waves created when the ribcage bites into the side obliques, and the rolling muscular hills. 
Here the body suggests motion even in stillness. I have struck a fluid pose by acting the part of a 
fisherman, then stopping, but most posed models can be a lot stiffer if they are directed with limbs 
positioned to match a rigid sketch. If you have the chance to do a photoshoot I recommend giving 
the model the freedom to interpret the sketch rather than mimic it. 
Opposite is my final drawing based on the photo reference. I consider this a failed drawing, for 
within this drawing I entered many hells, firstly structural hell where I was over concerned with 
getting proportion correct, which Ironically can result in getting proportion wrong. The reason 
for this is we tend to measure parts rather than relating broader shapes. By measuring structure to 
the detriment of rhythm and gesture will naturally result in a stiff drawing. Now, I know this, and 
was aware of the balance required, and still I struggled. 
Why did I struggle? Well, sometimes we just have an off day and it’s worth remembering that 
should we ever doubt ourselves, we are still better artists on our worse day than we were previously 
when we did our best drawing, as long as we have been constantly drawing, and therein lay the 
main problem, which was a dip in mileage. A month away from drawing had left its rust on my 
muscle memory. My hand had lost its fluidity. The mind was willing but the rhythm had stifled, I 
even resorted to the worst sin of all and entered render hell in order to bamboozle the unwary. Lets 
explore what is not usually discussed in books on art, which is a flawed drawing, and how difficult 
a drawing can be when we enter various hells, but most importantly, how to embrace the failure.

1 The Spectre of Doubt
Using my two-finger-wide sharpened charcoal piece I draw in the simple shapes to begin with. The 
male figure is notoriously ‘blocky’ and therefore I need to find as much gesture as I can. By finding 
simplicity we can uncover gesture, even in blocks. All is going well here as I did a few warm up 
gesture drawings beforehand which loosened some of the rust, but in the back of my mind lurks 
the spectre of doubt. The art is due for submission by the end of the day so I only have one go at 
this. I can already feel I’m not on my game and so the seeds of ego are also sown. 
2 An old Adage
I work on the ‘pinched’ side of the body first as the distances between forms is shorter and easier to 
judge than on the wider, longer, stretch side of the body. An invaluable tip I learned from master 
draftsman, Steve Huston. How could I not see this simple tip after years of drawing and painting? 
This reminds me of the old adage ‘We should never graduate from drawing’.
As usual I’m working with simple shapes first to easier deal with the complexities ahead. I can feel 
the head is too small but as this is a heroic pose I lean toward the smaller head and know the ad-
dition of hair will visually enlarge the cranium, so, I’m not too concerned.

3 Time to Dance
Gesture is king. If we work only with structure in mind our drawings will be stiff. Keep lines long 
and loose whenever possible. With the block-in stage mostly complete I once again employ the 
help of gesture to regain some fluidity. By working from one muscle to another it becomes ap-
parent they share similar shapes at their borders. It’s time to dance, time to chase the rhythms of 
muscle and flesh. 
Working with gesture has relieved some of the doubt and for a while I ride the crest of a wave, but I 
have sailed by without properly examining the reference, which, in this case, is not badly distorted, 
and have drawn the upper right arm too short, which by contrast makes the left arm seem overly 
long. The reason: I have fallen for one of the most ridiculous rookie errors, which is to try to fit the 
image on the page at the result of a short arm in the hope of fixing it later, when there is obviously 
no page left to make the arm longer! I’m embarrassed to even admit it, but there it is.
With a major rookie error identified I would normally stop the drawing, get a new sheet of paper 
and start again, but I’m not in my right mind here for in the background a camera was also rolling, 
recording the drawing as a movie, which was part of the commission. There was too much going 
on and I was running out of time. Pressure is not a friend of the artist.

4  To the Ends of the Earth
I put the short arm problem in my subconscious for now and work down the model’s left arm, 
continuing my rhythmic dance by drawing from one side to the other. Note the natural flow of 
things, how the forearm bulges are higher on the outside, much like the calves of the legs. I’m 
chasing rhythms again: left to right as usual but also high to low. All great method, which would 
normally see me through, but that arm isn’t going to fix itself and is constantly on my mind.
This is a rare occasion where the photo is more successful than the drawing. Having been a mer-
chant seaman as a young man it was easy for me to harness the adventure of those incredible years. 
Brief as they were in the scale of my life they contained a lifetime of experience and exposed me to 
the tropics, the arctic, and cultures far and wide, to the ends of the Earth, literally. 
The reason I have back-lit this photo, which is unusual for me, is to recreate a moonlight low on 
the horizon, one of the most atmospheric and beautiful times to be at sea. The ability to light a 
night scene during the day makes a camera an remarkable asset for artists.

5 Echoes of Rhythm
I title the art, ’The Pearl Fishers’, after a haunting piece of opera remembered from my childhood. 
In order to get into the mood I play the music as I work and find it a great motivator with its 
similar echoes of rhythm and gesture. I add a broad belt echoing the tilt of the hips. Note how 
the sacrum dimples above the shorts dictate the tilt. On a nude model we can use the dimples as 
a indicator for tilting belts or imaginary clothing by tracing a line through them. As the hips are 
fused these dimples will always line up.
6 The Shame
With the rhythms taken care of I dust the drawing back with tissue in order to get a softer un-
dercoat to work the darks and lights out of. I begin rendering the forearm and work up into the 
upper arm, rendering with the same rhythm as before. To my deepest shame I am relying on ren-
der to trick the eye into believing the arm is fine in its proportions. And therein lies the problem 
with rendering from photographic sources. When we see lots of detail we lose sight of proportion 
within photo-distortion, we simply accept that all is well because it looks ‘realistic’. I know this 
and reverse my usual method of fixing distortion, using my powers for evil rather than good.

7 The Language of Rhythm
Laying in the darks reveals the nature of muscles pushing into flesh to create ripples. See how the 
scapula pushes into the rhomboid muscles creating wave-like echoes all the way down the spine to 
the sacrum dimples of the hips. All this poetry leads me to draw a sensitive face, such is the power 
and language of rhythm. I think at this stage the figure is at its best, but because my ego is dented 
I decide to continue, playing the hero who can still win this fight. This leads to one of my mantras: 
leave your ego at the art studio door (you can always pick it back up on the way out).
8 Render Hell
With the game afoot I continue further into the depths of ‘Render Hell’. Having pulled back some 
confidence and some level of dignity I draw a thicker rope than the anemic one I posed with in the 
reference. Harking back to my Merchant Navy days I am well aware of the kind of ropes used on a 
ship and how thick they can be. The drawing gains a mass of authenticity from that one thought. 
My past life helps me rekindle the atmosphere of life on deck: the salt sea air and how it adds 
moisture to the skin; the overly tanned forearms; the matted hair, all comes back to me. All good 
honest stuff, but I am also using the thick rope to shorten the appearance of the forearm, which 
is less honest.

9 The Depths of Hell
Drawing the arm bracelet leads me into a stiff corner, and the depths of Render Hell I break out a 
piece of compressed charcoal and engage my gestural hand again. I also add some abstract shapes 
in the background with willow charcoal for added movement. Normally a textured background 
will help bring a figure forward and make the flesh look more fleshy by contrast, but here it high-
lights the short arm. If we look back at the previous stage we can see that the white background 
made the arm seem longer due to the amount of space behind it, which demonstrates the law of 
relationships and how it affects or perceptions, such as dark clothes making us appear slimmer. 
The texture also makes the outreaching nature of the arm seem like less of a distance.
Adding a metal hair ring and a row of bolts to the belt adds further exotic elements and more 
movement, but the chimes of doom cannot be quelled. At this point I have all but conceded that 
the drawing is a magnificent failure, but nothing kills creativity more than doubt, and so I blaze 
ahead regardless. Working broad strokes  into the native Lavalava sarong brings some hope of 
redemption and stokes my optimism that the drawing can still be saved. This is a perfect time to 
take a break and reassess the situation and plan a strategy to escape this hell of my own making.

10 The Beautiful Antagonist
I return to the drawing with renewed energy. If I may give myself one affirmation it is my eternal 
optimism. If you lack optimism, then fake it until it becomes true inside. Tell yourself you are a 
magnificent artist as you draw as there will be plenty of time during the break for critique. Of all 
the skills I have acquired, it is my natural born optimism that is my main strength, for which I 
credit my mother who displayed that strength in abundance. 
I continue highlighting with erasers and detailing with pencils. Despite the shortness of the raised 
arm I enjoy rendering the beautiful antagonistic nature of the triceps and biceps as they work in 
sync. The triceps are lengthening to allow the biceps to contract and shorten. The opposite is hap-
pening on the straight arm.
The back-lit photo is my crutch now and I cling to it for much needed strength, and it provides. I 
work an oily sheen into the flesh by contrasting the darks and lights more I add ‘gold’ spots to the 
sarong with an eraser, which feels a touch feminine for a fisherman, but I like the spots too much 
to let them go. To counter this I draw a rugged face. This is a more interesting face but may not be 
an improvement as the head is now larger, making the arm appear shorter still.

11 An Old Dog
As I suspected the continued rendering has killed a lot of the gestural energy of the earlier stages 
and I counter with further swirls of charcoal to express an abstract storm and windy rain. From 
this point onward I fight to regain footing with a more scattered pattern of dots on the sarong and 
jangly gold to the head dressing. The rendering and line work recover the drawing in some way, 
as all those hard fought for skills are on show. An old dog can put up a hell of a fight when it’s 
cornered. To the average eye it’s now an adequate drawing, but falls well below my original aim 
due to its proportional flaws. I will continue past this point to the result shown at the beginning 
of this workshop to further flash more style around for my penance.
When I called this a ‘failed drawing’ earlier it was an attention seeking call to arms, as there are no 
real failures in art, only learning experiences. If we don’t experience ‘failure’ then there is no going 
forward. Embrace the fear! Experimentation wins out when playing the long game of art, despite 
the pitfalls, and I’m all-in as far as the long game goes. As with most longer studies I’m left with 
a drawing more rendered than I would like, but for all its flaws I’ve gained further knowledge of 
how muscles shape-shift and work together, and planted the knowledge into my subconscious art 
engine for the future drawings to come.

very once in a while I meet up with two artist friends of mine, 
Richard Denham and Andrew Trimmer, to talk art. We are an art 
brotherhood in search of a name. One time we met they were both 
enthused about a book by George Leonard, entitled :‘Mastery: The Keys 
to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment. The title of the book would have 
had me sway past it in any book store as it sounded like a get-rich-quick 
kind of deal, but it turned to be a book about discipline, particularly the 
discipline found in martial arts, and it touched upon a buried weakness of 
mine— the will to surrender. 
Surrendering to the discipline of practice was an echo from my past when 
I first surrendered to ego, which I will discuss further in this workshop. It 
became obvious that I had been working with these principles on a sub-
conscious level for many years, but like a good psychiatrist Mr. Leonard 
made it clear to me when he spoke of the plateau. 
What is a plateau beyond being a high mountainous ledge? In martial arts 
its the period of repetition needed to acquire a skilled move, so fluid that 
it can be done instinctively, almost without thinking. 
In art the plateau is often rushed as it’s the period when we seem stuck in 
one place and are no longer learning anything new. With art, like all skills, 
we need to practice repetition in order to master our medium, be it pencil, 
oils, or most of all, expressive mark making. We need to surrender to the 
fact that this takes discipline and time. 
Once we accept the discipline of practice we experience an unexpected bo-
nus—the joy of the plateau. The moment I learned to surrender and enjoy 
the learning experience I realised what true art is, which is not the final 
destination, but a lifetime of practicing the process of art itself. By enjoy-
ing the practice of each new skill I found myself always in the moment, 
and never in pursuit of something else.

oday we will draw Katy while 
discussing the anatomy of 
style and the disciplines of art.
As a young artist I was driven by 
my love of art, and my devotion 
to drawing. I believed love and 
devotion were the only disciplines 
needed to scale each new wall and 
reach each new plateau, but one 
day, many years into my career, 
I realised my taste in art had 
changed. I faced a colossal wall 
carved with the unforgiving words: 
‘Why are you unhappy?’
‘I want to draw with more style 
and freedom,’ I replied. 
‘What’s stopping you?’ the wall 
asked. 
‘I’m a photo-realist, my work 
makes people gasp with admira-
tion,’ I said. ‘If I change now I 
won’t be so impressive’. 
‘Then surrender your ego,’ the wall 
demanded. And in my silent sur-
render a giant wall toppled and I 
ascended to a new plateau.
I wrote three words that would 
anchor me in future moments of 
doubt: Love, Devotion and Sur-
render, and writing them down 
changed everything.
Good fortune had gifted me the 
first two disciplines of love and 
devotion, yet the act of surrender 
proved difficult. In my quest for 
artistic freedom I was all over the 
place, painting and drawing, ob-
sessed with high ambitions, leaving 
little time to practice each new 
skill. With this headless chicken 
approach my art seemed to get 
worse. I needed to slow down. I 
surrendered to the fact that true 
progression takes time and was 
1
able to hone my skills until I reached 
each new plateau. I learned once more 
that surrender could be a discipline. 
Art, I discovered, was not like anything 
else.
In the past when I art directed my 
models like mannequins, adjusting 
every finger and tilt to echo the sketch,  
Invariably ended up with stiff poses. 
I needed to surrender my ego once 
more and allow the model interpretive 
freedom. The fact that Katy’s poses are 
so fluid is the result of her own artistic 
disciplines.  The fact that I managed to 
harness this force of nature in a photo 
is the result of my discipline to surren-
der to Katy’s interpretations.
1 What’s Wrong with this Photo?
Let’s take a little time to praise the 
camera and its ability to capture a 
frozen moment of motion. If this pose 
was from life Katy would start to flag 
and shift microscopically and would 
lose the energy found in the split 
second the photo was taken. Let’s also 
study the problems with this photo. 
Firstly Katy’s left hand looks odd and 
kills the rhythmic flow, secondly the 
stretch side of the body is almost a 
straight line. These are just the obvious 
problems so I need stay on high alert 
as I draw.
2 Sweet Surrender
I start with the rhythmic flow of the 
figure, back and forth from one side 
to the other. I used to measure pro-
portions with great importance but 
ended up with dull drawings. Once I 
surrendered to rhythm more for my 
proportional guide my drawings were 
no longer so ‘correct’ but they were 
more interesting, gestural, and filled 
with life.

3 The Lifeless Dummy
Here I’ve interpreted the photo reference 
toward the dynamic. The stretch side 
has more gesture due to the hip popping 
forward more, with more overlaps, and 
undulations all the way down. I delete 
Katy’s hand as it looks odd, like a lifeless 
dummy’s hand. I’ve also dropped Katy’s 
left arm in order for the deleted hand to 
appear as if it’s behind her back. Many 
studious hours committed to the love 
and devotion of craft has made this bal-
ance of gesture and structure possible.
4 Play the Accordion
With the extra bend of the torso I make 
sure the pinch side is counterpoised with 
wider distances on the stretch side, like 
an accordion. Imagine a line through 
the nipples, rib pinch, and hip crests to 
see what I mean. At this stage I title the 
drawing, ‘The Storm Bringer’ which sets 
the mood to come.

5 The lost Depth
I block in the core shadows. The stretch 
side of the photo-reference was visually 
flat due to tangent lines (converging lines 
that destroy the illusion of depth). Study 
the flatness brought about by tangents in 
the photo compared to the newly applied 
overlapping forms of the drawing. I have 
overlapped Katy’s ribcage with her right 
breast and pushed the hip and tenth rib 
forward to regain the lost depth. If your 
photo-reference lacks depth see if you 
can create overlapping forms.
6 Surrender to the Rhythm
Using tissue I soften the forms. My fig-
ure is shorter in proportion but the natu-
ral rhythm gained is more important. If 
I were to go in now and make the legs 
longer it would kill the organic rhythm 
and the drawing would become horribly 
stiff. I feel surrendering to the rhythm 
was the right choice and I lay-in gestural 
lines on top of the structures.

7 Stay Focused
I bring out Katy’s right shoulder and 
triceps and overlap the ribcage across the 
obliques to continue to find more illu-
sion of depth with overlaps. As I smudge 
tone I’m aware that the head had grown 
bigger as I added details and note to my-
self to trim it down later, for now I’m on 
a mission to find depth and don’t what 
to be distracted with fixes which could 
kill my focus and rhythm. I also note the 
cast shadow of Katy’s left leg has created 
a bow-legged look to her right leg.
8 If it Looks Wrong, it’s Wrong!
I step back and assess the drawing. I 
decide the cast shadow of the arm should 
drop over the ribcage instead of across 
the breast. It now reads more clearly and 
dimensionally, and has more gestural 
appeal. In my live workshops I say: If it 
looks wrong, it’s wrong, even if it’s right! 
This conundrum is always guaranteed to 
raise student’s eyebrows.

9 Energy and Purpose
We have done a lot of work taming 
this photo and it’s paying off with fresh 
energy and rhythm. I work on the edges, 
softening core shadows and fading Katy’s 
left arm into a sfumato mist. I slant 
Katy’s head making it more dynamic and 
smaller. The head needs to be smaller still 
and I think on it as I highlight the upper 
torso. Thinking ahead as I work adds 
energy and purpose to my hand, which 
is different from multi-tasking where 
we constantly interrupt the flow of one 
thing only to do another thing just as 
badly.
10 A Metaphorical Storm
Alternating between my drawing tools 
I reduce the head and fade the right leg 
into shadow to kill the bow-legged look. 
With this new shadow shape I’m con-
sidering both story and style and plan 
to run a line of action through the body 
in the shape of a metaphorical storm. 
Always going forward, always thinking 
ahead.

11 A Insecure Decision
Katy’s hand may seem big here next to 
her foreshortened forearm, but I find 
hands and feet look better bigger rather 
than smaller. If I were to make the hand 
smaller it would feel like an insecure 
decision. When we look at the photo it’s 
actually the head that’s too small regard-
ing photo-distortion. Here I add sublim-
inal rhythm with gold head bands which 
echo the shape of the skull. The mono 
eraser is great for this.
12 Engage the Storm
Time for the metaphorical storm. With 
a block of compressed charcoal I en-
gage the gestural hand with fluidity set 
at maximum to bring out the raging 
tempest. 
Compressed charcoal is dark and may 
hinder confidence with its stark nature. 
To draw with bold confidence try prac-
ticing on some scrap newsprint before 
drawing on your art. Light strokes build-
ing to dark strokes is the best approach.
11
129

13 It’s a Kind of magic
Reshaping the gestural lines to repre-
sent a storm has killed some gestural 
flow. There are trade-offs as we draw but 
keeping our disciplines in place, while 
also taking chances, enables us to learn 
something new. Next time I use this 
rhythmic charcoal technique I’ll surren-
der more to the natural rhythm and not 
try to control it as much. This is a bal-
ancing act watercolourist know all about. 
Sometimes we must let the medium do 
as it likes in order to find freshness and 
energy. It’s also exciting when the art 
surprises the artist. It’s a kind of magic.
14 Love, Devotion and Surrender
We are a world away from the reference 
photo now and the micro changes to 
structure and gesture have created a style 
uniquely mine, and if you have drawn 
along you will have a drawing uniquely 
yours. Embracing the disciplines of love, 
devotion and surrender don’t limit our 
art, instead, they embolden us with free-
dom of expression.

or most of  this book I have been casting my eyes of suspicion upon the 
magic box that is the camera with its primitive processing brain and wonky 
eye. As I look back at myself with some reproach I feel a little cruel, for, after 
all if we strip away the technical marvel that is its creation we are left with only a 
dim-witted servant. The problem is the camera has become the master of many art-
ists and has achieved a level of malignancy that is unparalleled in art history. The 
servant has become the master. How do we regain control of an automation that is 
running amok spreading lies about proportions and depth? We must first lose the 
fear of its control. In this final part of our exploration in working with photos I will 
show how we can regain mastery and lead with our emotion and our artistic nature 
at the fore.
Opposite is a photo of professional model and dancer, Katy  Woods. The camera 
has told mostly the truth here due to Katy staying within its focal plane. None of 
her limbs are coming toward or away from us in any drastic manner, she stands 
within the 2D realm of up and down and side to side, therefore she retains her pro-
portions almost as our human eyes see her. She has been shot with a 50mm prime 
lens from a distance, then the surrounding background, the outer area of the lens 
containing the most distortion, was cropped out. That’s as good as it gets through 
the eye of the camera. A student took a photo of me at a weekend workshop a while 
back with her iphone and it looked like my head had been sucked into a vortex just 
off screen. If you are on a budget I recommend buying a good secondhand camera 
from a professional photographer who is upgrading and selling.
Apart from the inevitable tonal banding  ‘sudden value shifts’ the flesh is blending 
without too much information missing, so all is tip-top. Let’s look at some less for-
tunate photos and along the way some praise for our poor one-eyed friend.

e have all at some point watched an artist work and wondered 
how they make it look so easy, when it comes so hard to us. If 
we don’t want to think too much we could say it’s ‘talent’ and 
stroll off uninformed. I recently watched Rodger Dean paint a picture 
and he spent two thirds of the process looking and thinking before mak-
ing a flawless mark. That flawless mark of course came from a lifetime of 
application, passion, and study. Once we understand that all artists work 
hard to achieve their vision then we have opened our minds to follow 
that same path. The only problem then is we can’t read minds. When an 
artist gives a workshop there are moments when they are quiet. Ironically 
this is the artist most likely working with their deepest thoughts.
In this workshop we will not draw the figure, but simply analyse and un-
derstand what we looking at. This is that quiet moment I talked about— 
the inner workings of the mind. I often talk about my process of Analyse, 
Understand and Draw: A.U.D. We can always see the drawing part of an 
artist’s  process, but here I will stop short of mark-making to show the 
other two thirds of that process, which are the most important, for with-
out understanding we may as well try grabbing a handful of smoke.
As we are working with photos there is more analysing to do regarding 
distortion and depth, but most of what we will examine next contains the 
same thought processes I use when drawing from life.

One of my favourite quotes is: ‘It is necessary to keep one’s compass in one’s eyes and not in the hand, for the 
hands execute, but the eye judges’. This pearl of wisdom was from none other than the great Michelangelo. But 
what did he mean? Well’ in academic art circles there is a method know as the ‘sight size’ method, which is a bit 
of an oxymoron as it requires measuring with tools. For instance they might use a plumb line, which is a line 
with a weight at the end. When held up the line will find a perfect straight regardless of  uneven ground. With 
a plumb line we can relate how certain landmarks of the body line up. It’s a marvelous method to begin with, 
and to continue with if it is your preference, but I prefer the Michelangelo method for one solid reason; and 
that is gesture. I’ve watched masters of academic art maintain the gesture using the sight sized method but I have 
chosen the path of ‘learning to see’ the lines of measurement as imaginary lines as it’s simply more natural to me.

Let’s look at the plumb line idea. Imagine I’m holding the weighted line with one eye closed. I hold the line 
high enough that it runs through the whole body. I then move the line across any pose, especially a difficult 
pose like this one, and search for relationships. I have found three examples, the nipple to the index finger, the 
bottom lip to the top of the ear, and the bottom of the chin to the insertion of the biceps femoris tendon. A 
useful exorcise would be to try the plumb line method to begin with and then see if you can learn to see these 
relationships with imaginary straight lines. I‘ve found using imagination much more enjoyable and no longer 
use the sight size method, as it’s not as necessary in my analytical approach to drawing the figure,  but we can 
learn a lot from it as we will see.

Clavicle Peaks
Another important factor when analysing relationships between landmarks of the body is to imagine a net cast 
over the figure. This is often referred to as an ‘envelope’, but I prefer a net as it’s more evocative. Here we can 
almost imagine a mermaid struggle to get free. I run the net from one knee to the other and on to the outmost 
fingers then up to the ribcage and hips. The spaces in between the net and body are known as ‘negative space’ 
and help us see shapes that break down the figure into a more manageable set of steps, rather than one muddled 
mass. Casting a net can also help us fit the figure onto the page. I will often draw a net if I need to do this, 
therefore the net idea is recommended if you find your figure drawings often run off the page proportionally.
A plumb line that finds up and down relationships is a great start, but it’s a pretty narrow experience. What if 
we take the line taut in two hands and turn it at angles? Now a whole world of relationships open up. Look how 
the accordion rhythm of the body looks as we measure lines across the landmarks of the body such as the hip 
bone ridges, clavicle peaks, the nipples and the ridge of the rib cage. I also make note of the ear position as it’s 
a great indicator of how the head is tilted. As the figure is no longer standing straight we observe the landmarks 
have shifted to our advantage, giving us fluid asymmetry. Here I’m showing the inner workings of my mind’s 
eye when analysing a figure before making a mark on paper, all based on the sight sized method.

Another analytical process is to understand the figure in 3D space. Here photos have one supreme advantage 
over life drawing in that we can draw on the ‘virtual’ model. If you have a programme such as Photoshop, which 
I have used here, start by drawing contours on the body as if it has dimension. This helps us understand the 
anatomy as dimensional rather than mindlessly copying a flat illusion of form onto a page. Note the interlock-
ing shapes of the arm as a structural idea here and the box nature of the hand. In this example most thought pro-
cesses are on show plus the analyses of structural muscle shapes. Remember not all of these thought processes are 
happening at the same time, meaning I don’t draw all this beforehand, what I do is analyse everything broadly 
to begin with then continue the analyse throughout as I draw—A.U.D: Analyse, Understand, and Draw.
If you refer back to my drawings you will see that I don’t begin a drawing with these lines, apart from the occa-
sional net, but they are constantly in my mind’s eye when analysing relationships. With these imaginary markers 
I can draw gesturally without the need to use actual plumb lines or pencil measurements, which is the classic 
stance of an artist closing one eye using a thumb and pencil to measure. As we are working from a flat photo I 
take extra note of overlaps as they will help with the illusion of depth. Note the overlaps of the breast, gluteus 
maximus, which is also overlapping it’s own tendon and the biceps femoris after the tendon. Here I also analyse 
smaller plumb lines, gauging the negative space between the chin and nose, then the nose and forehead. This I 
analyse as I draw big shapes to small shapes. You could think along the lines of  big mass analysis to small mass 
analysis.

Let’s look at a pose more perspectively warped by the camera’s eye than our human eyes would see. This is more 
of a fly’s eye view with Alana being relatively a hundred feet long. Here the torso alone is longer than the legs due 
to the extreme foreshortening of the lens. We get natural foreshortening through our human vision of course, 
but we need to learn the difference when analysing photos, otherwise or drawings will look like poor renditions 
of photos with all the flaws intact. Finding the basic mid point of the great trochanter hip bone to the top of the 
head is a good start to get a notion of what a basic mid-way point would be on a standing figure. 
Once we see the extreme nature of the distortion we can reign it in a bit. This is when hand measurements are 
‘handy’. The hand on the floor is in the 2D non-distorted horizontal zone. We can check it now as a basic length 
for other hand long landmarks such as: the clavicles, the sternum, the sternum to the tenth rib, and the length 
of  the top of the foot. We could also use it for the chin to the hairline, but the camera has done a good job and 
I see no unnatural foreshortening here. It feels like the natural foreshortening seen through human eyes. By 
using yardsticks, such as hand lengths, as a basic guide we then use our feelings to also not fall into the trap of 
shoehorning measurements. We need to learn to feel as well as to learn to see what is wrong.
We know the camera struggles with the idea of the third dimension (depth) but modern cameras, especially 
50mm fixed lenses, do very well with any objects on the straight vertical or horizontal plane and is the reason 
why a 50mm lens is the photographer’s first choice for portrait photography. The focal depth from the nose to 
the cheek and the side plane of the face to the ear is not a big deal and will look perfectly normal, but once we 
have a leg or arm come forward or go backward in space the camera, literally, out of its depth. For that reason 
I always look for objects  on the vertical and horizontal to judge the camera’s eye against. There are photo apps 
that fix camera distortion but usually distort something else in doing so. I encourage artists to learn to see distor-
tion, for one thing we won’t always have our computer programmes with us, and for another thing we will have 
gained stronger ‘learning to see’ skills.
In this photo the most obvious objects on the basic vertical and horizontal planes are the upper arm portion 
of the arm leaning on the floor and the almost horizontal forearm and hand. These are the least distorted ele-
ments from which we can judge everything else. The breasts are also within the same vertical depth (plane) even 
though they are slightly tilted. Learning to play the horizontal and vertical two dimensional game simplifies our 
quest for natural proportions.

When we work from photos we are gifted a frozen pose, which is both a curse and a godsend. Gone are the 
slight movements of the model over time and also the play of muscles changing due to fatigue. As the model 
gets tired they engage fresher muscles to take over from tired muscles, and the body often hunches forward in a 
standing pose. This particular pose would be unsustainable after five minutes at best. For this kind of pose and 
also action poses the camera is an incredible asset to the artist. So here I am praising the camera, as I should, as 
it is a miracle of science, we just need to be wary of its shortcomings.
One shortcoming of the camera is in its flattening of form. There is hardly any definition in the torso here. The 
mid tones merge to together as do the light tones and highlights. One trick is to bring the photo into Photoshop 
or a similar a programme and bring the levels together. By doing this we reveal hidden forms. The old paperback 
artists such as James Avati would create three separate exposures of  the same photo to get a clearer idea of light 
and form and also for dramatic lighting ideas, taking information from each exposure to dramatise his work. I 
do this too for my paintings. In the photo opposite I’ve dimmed the light using Photoshop levels to reveal more 
mid-tones. This has killed all  the information in the shadows but between both exposures we have all the infor-
mation we need to find anatomical detail. The thing then is to not to fall into the trap of drawing everything we 
find in both exposures,  otherwise we will end up with an over detailed drawing, it’s just a way to see some forms 
that got lost in the exposure then pick and choose what we want to emphasise, just as our old friend James did.
Here I’ve adjusted the  levels to reveal more anatomy within the lighter areas. This creates  a deeper chiaroscuro 
light. You can now use this more dramatic light to draw or paint like the old masters and let the details disappear 
into the shadows, or use it along with the original photos to simply see the anatomy that wasn’t so obviously vis-
ible. This is further praise for the camera. Although I could recreate this light using studio equipment, it would 
take much longer than the time spent pulling three sliders around in a computer programme.
Note how we are almost box-shaped at the lateral side of our body and how it makes us aware of the gestural 
ledge leading down the leg all the way from the corner of the ribcage. If we put our hands at he side of our rib-
cage it can be surprising how flat that area is, we only feel the curve as we push over the tenth rib to the front. I 
consider the tenth rib to be the ‘corner’ point of the torso. The term ‘core shadow, makes clear sense here as we 
can see the ‘cor’ner change from light into dark. The major landmarks such as the iliac peak and the tenth rib 
are clearer to see in this darkened photo due to their sharp bony edges, but the main benefit is in finding those 
muscles lost in over-exposed light such as the junction where the latissimus meet the ribcage. Also note how 
the gluteus comes from the side to disappear behind the obliques, that’s why I sometimes call the gluteus the 
‘behind and side’ and also the ‘behind and under’ as we see it from the front in certain poses looking through 
the legs. There is a good reason for the name ‘Gluteus Maximus, as it’s the bulkiest muscle in the body.

Let’s play the simple contour game! When working with a nude model we have the opportunity to see how 
the flesh turns. This gives us the opportunity to practice adorning the body with imaginary jewelry. If we are 
working in the realm of fantasy art we need to train our imagination. Some artists set up a photoshoot hiring 
costume and jewelry, and it’s a whole heap of fun. I highly recommend getting together with friends to dress up 
and act. It was a great bonding experience when teaching my early fantasy workshops at college here in Brisbane, 
Australia. The students loved it and often recite it back to me as a college highlight over ten years later, as it was 
for me too as a young fledgling teacher.
The only drawback to working with a costumed modes is it can lead to a misunderstanding of form. Clothes 
hide form and if we are always working with clothed models it’s very easy to lose our sense of the figure and 
before long we become lazy and eventually our anatomy skills deteriorate to the point where we need to have 
every piece of adornment worn and adjusted in the photoshoot to begin with. By playing the simple contour 
game we will always be equipped to add any jewelry or adornments on the fly. By drawing simple contours and 
arrows on photos we train our eyes to see direction and volume. I often see students add fantasy elements com-
ing at us in the wrong dimension. Look how wrong the dark contour line of the raised arm is here. It’s clearly 
the wrong contour shape along which to draw an imaginary bracelet.Try the simple contour game, it’s quick, 
fun, and vitally important for fantasy artists to understand.
Anatomy is already complex ‘the right way up’ and can take the wind out of even the most seasoned artist in a 
pose such as this. Once again this is when photography is the artist’s friend. By drawing anatomy over the photo 
we become more acquainted with the forms before we commit to a drawing on paper. I do this kind of draw-
over mostly for my online students during Q&A sessions to illustrate what’s in my mind as I draw and find that 
it adds to my own internal art engine. In other words we all benefit from this analysis regardless of experience 
levels.
By playing the complex contour game we gain a deeper understanding of how the muscle and flesh shapes 
change as they contract or compress under weight or via gravity. Note the huge difference between the shape 
of each breast. The upper breast is being pulled up by the raised pectoralis, which is attached to the upper arm, 
which in turn compresses the breast into a new shape against the hard ribcage. The lower breast by contrast is 
being pulled down by gravity with very little pressure against the ribcage. Note also the bulge of the adductor 
magnus of the upper leg under the pull of gravity compared to the flatter adductors of the lower leg flattened 
by compression. Notice the box-like nature of the bent knee compared to the cone-like nature of the extended 
knee. Study the separation of muscles and plane changes here then try it yourself. It is immensely rewarding 
when it all makes sense.

Oblique Stretch
Elongated Tube Effect
Although this is a foreshortened pose it’s not so much the torso that is distorted , it’s the furthest thigh that’s 
more foreshortened than our eyes would see, which is only noticeable because of the lower leg seeming wider on 
the vertical, less distorted, 2D plane. So why does the torso seem so long? Apart from some natural foreshort-
ening there are a few reasons. First off the obliques are being stretched and also the ribcage is being elongated. 
There are intercostal muscles between the ribs that allow the ribcage to expand. In this pose they are allowing the 
ribcage to become slightly longer. With arms raised we see a tube formed torso which optically appears longer, 
just like vertical stripes appear longer than vertical stripes.
Now it may seem that I’m the arch-enemy of photo-distortion, and I am when photos are traced without any 
understanding, making us incumbent slaves with no will who are fearful of stepping out of line. But here’s the 
rub­— I actually admire artists who play with proportions, such as Egon Schiele and Jenny Saville. What make 
their work so exciting is they know their anatomy well enough to make personal distortions that are not reli-
ant on camera distortion. How can we tell the difference? Well let’s simply take the ribcage as an example. If it 
retain’s its egg shaped nature we can make it a longer egg, whereas the camera might distort it into a skewed egg.

Now that we understand the weakness of the camera’s lens we can become the master rather than the slave. By 
learning to see the landmarks of the body we can draw on top of the photo to find simple structure. Landmarks 
are usually bones and so we can seek them out. The tenth rib almost always makes its presence known, as does 
the 7th vertebra (the top of the ribcage), therefore we can trace an egg shape  to find if it’s distorted by the cam-
era. Here it looks pretty good. From this point we can play the shapes game. The knees always box-off especially 
in a lateral side view with some top showing, as in both legs here. Notice the pinch of the acromion process bone 
when the arms are raised. Here we can wrap the hot-air balloon shape of the deltoid around the pinch.
What the great masters of art were most interested in was not so much getting the proportions ‘correct’ but in 
making the relationships of forms harmonise. In the art deco period it was all about the geometric shapes com-
plimenting each other. With most figurative artists it’s the opposite, we want our figure to look fluid, not stiff. 
When we have found our structural shapes we can link them with gesture, adjusting the flow to our own will. 
Here I’m exploring muscles and also shadows that I will most certainly make more gestural in my drawing. Note 
how I’m chasing rhythms down the body, especially in the arm and hand.

With all the anatomy and structural analysis done we can start thinking of style. Remember I am doing all this 
analysis internally. With photos and computers we can actually draw on top of the photos as I have done here, 
but it’s best to train our eyes to see this on the live model. Use every aid you need  and eventually you will no 
longer need to draw over a photo first. We can then consider ourselves free from slavery and draw with our eyes 
as the master decision maker. As we no longer have a standing figure we can learn to see a half way point to 
make the figure easier to proportion, In a standing figure pose half way would be roughly the hip bone area, in 
this pose with the arms raised it’s around the lower part of the scapula.
When considering 3D depth it’s a fun idea to imagine thick-headed arrows shooting into space. Play with the 
idea using photos to show the directions of the head, limbs and torso. As the arrows head away into space make 
the underside of the arrows wider or narrower based on how deep or shallow you think the structures are be-
ing foreshortened. Note the arrowhead indicating the direction of the forearm has very little curve, indicating 
it is heading toward us only slightly and therefore has basically no foreshortening to it, whereas the we can see 
underneath the arrowhead indicating the thigh going away from us and the top of the arrowhead of the thigh 
coming toward us. Playing the shooting arrows  game will train our eyes to see 3D space within a 2D photo.

Let’s look at an artistic pose seen from an un-
usual viewpoint. Here I’ve flipped the photo 
to create a supernatural pose. This is an ex-
ample of photography giving us the power 
to experiment with a pose beyond the abili-
ties of any life model. We can easily imagine 
a vampire defying the laws of gravity to peer 
in a window for instance. I usually present 
Alana with thumbnail sketches then let her 
continue the idea using her inner emotions, 
in other words — to become the vampire! 
My artworks are an art collaboration and 
would be severely diluted with an inferior 
model. When you discover a great model, 
treasure them like gold.
By this point I’m sure you have a good 
idea how to play all these games of find-
ing structure, gesture, and 3D space within 
a 2D photo. Note how deep for  instance 
the spine is, which is deeper still on the male 
figure. Note how the iliac crest has lost it’s 
high curve from this view point. Lay a sheet 
of tracing paper over the unmarked photo 
opposite and copy these exploratory shapes, 
then see how much more structure you can 
add to the photo yourself. The more we learn 
to see the more fuel we have for our internal 
art engine, and the stronger we become as 
artists.

rawing the nude figure creates a timeless image, carved from the endurance and 
evolution of our ancestors over hundreds of thousands of years, unblemished or 
dated by the clothes of  fashion. What better a subject to rejoice in than the ex-
traordinary specimens we have become. We are a body landscape sometimes embellished 
with exotic markings, tattoos or jewelry, or posed simply unadorned in all our original 
splendor. By interpreting the human figure with line and tone we scratch our individual 
marks on paper and canvas to leave eternal memories of our common humanity and con-
nection to one another. I believe art is the ultimate expression of who we are. In this joyful 
act of creation we leave a lasting impression of our brief time and place in the world, as did 
the artists before us and the artists to come. 
For me drawing and painting the figure has been the most challenging and also the most 
fulfilling of all artistic pursuits and I hope I have inspired you to find the same bounty 
through my art and teachings.
And so it comes time to say farewell and close the curtain on another series of workshops. 
I trust these adventures in art have been as enjoyable for you as they have been for me. For 
my art companions who are reading these words after having taken online or live work-
shops with me, I thank you once again for joining me here in spirit and for being part of 
the ever growing community of artists exploring the spiritual and emotional appreciation 
of the human figure.

In the follow up to his #1 bestselling figure drawing books, ‘The Anatomy of Style’ and ‘Figures from Life’, comes 
‘Drawing from Photos’, Patrick’s latest volume of step-by-step drawing techniques. In this volume Patrick rewrites 
and vastly enlarges on his collected ImagineFX workshops, delving deeper into the subject in book format. Within 
these workshops we will explore the art of drawing from photos and the minefield of unseen problems such as dis-
tortion, tangents, and shallow depth. Each step-by-step includes a model posing to refer to as you draw along, rec-
reating a virtual workshop from Patrick’s eye view as he shares his methods, insights and interpretations to produce 
drawings with style and confidence. For sheer depth of writing and information no artist, art lover, or student 
should be without this latest volume on their bookshelves!
The Sci-Fi & Fantasy Art of Patrick J. Jones: Our Highest Recommendation! This is a must-have; we’ve already 
been captivated by his work for the two how-to books he’s done. On top of his highly detailed execution and finish, 
Patrick’s coloring is just astonishing. It is so beautifully done, like Maxfield Parrish or Frazetta. This may just be our 
favorite art book of the year!
