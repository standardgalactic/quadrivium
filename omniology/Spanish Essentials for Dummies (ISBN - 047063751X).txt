Spanish Essentials For Dummies

Introduction
A
s someone who’s studying Spanish, you want to write 
and speak correctly and to master the many different 
verb tenses and conjugations. Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
can help you reach your goals painlessly and effortlessly as 
you enhance your Spanish language skills.
Spanish Essentials For Dummies presents you with all the 
grammar you need to know to communicate clearly. With 
the help of this book, you’ll be ready to have a conversation 
about topics besides your name and the weather! And that’s 
something to be proud of.
About This Book
Spanish Essentials For Dummies is a reference book for people 
who have some knowledge of the fundamentals of Spanish. If 
you want to get up to speed with language structures so that 
you can communicate comfortably and proficiently, this book 
is for you.
Each chapter presents a different topic that allows you to 
practice your communication skills. We include plenty of 
examples to guide you through the rules so you’re exposed 
to colloquial, everyday, correct Spanish that native speakers 
expect to hear from someone using Spanish. For example, 
the Spanish language has its individual idioms and idiomatic 
expressions that give it color and flair. Here’s a quick exam-
ple: To say that it’s sunny outside in Spanish, you remark, 
Hace sol. The literal English translation of this expression 
is It is making sun. Even my dear old grandma wouldn’t have 
spoken English like that! Well, make sure you don’t speak 
Spanish that way, either.

Conventions Used in This Book
In order to highlight the most important information and to 
help you navigate this book more easily, we’ve set up several 
conventions:
 
✓ Spanish terms and sentences, as well as endings we want 
to highlight, are set in boldface to make them stand out.
 
✓ English equivalents, set in italics, follow the Spanish 
example.
 
✓ We use many abbreviations throughout the book. Don’t let 
them throw you. For instance, you may find the following:
 
• fem.: feminine
 
• masc.: masculine
 
• sing.: singular
 
• pl.: plural
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, we made the following assumptions:
 
✓ You have some knowledge of the fundamentals of 
Spanish grammar. You’re looking for the opportunity to 
review what you’ve already mastered and are intent on 
moving forward to new areas of knowledge.
 
✓ You want a book that’s complete but isn’t so advanced 
that you get lost in the rules. We try to explain the rules 
as clearly as possible without using too many grammati-
cal terms.
 
✓ You’re boning up on Spanish verbs for your own edifica-
tion, or your son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, 
niece, nephew, or special someone is studying Spanish 
and you want to help even though you haven’t looked at 
a verb conjugation for years.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those cute little drawings on the left side of the page 
that call out for your attention. They signal a particularly valu-
able piece of information. Here’s a list of the icons in this book:

 Introduction

Remember icons call your attention to important information 
about the language — something you shouldn’t neglect or 
something that’s out of the ordinary. Don’t ignore these 
paragraphs.
 
Tip icons present time-saving information that makes commu-
nication quick and effective. If you want to know the proper 
way to do things, check out the Tip icons first.
 
The Warning icon points out certain differences between 
English and Spanish that you may find confusing. If you want 
to know how Spanish constructions differ from those in 
English, these are the paragraphs you need to consult.
Where to Go from Here
One great thing about For Dummies books is that you don’t 
have to read them chapter by chapter from the very begin-
ning to the (not-so) bitter end. Each chapter stands on its own 
and doesn’t require that you complete any of the other chap-
ters in the book. This setup saves you a lot of time if you’ve 
mastered certain topics but feel a bit insecure about others.
So, jump right in. Get your feet wet. If you’re not sure exactly 
where to begin, take a good look at the table of contents and 
select the topic that seems to best fit your abilities and needs. 
If you’re concerned that your background may not be strong 
enough, you can start at the very beginning and work your 
way through the book.
Keep in mind that studying Spanish isn’t a contest. Work at 
a pace that best suits your needs. Don’t hesitate to read a 
chapter a second, third, or even a fourth time several days 
later. You can easily adapt this book to your learning abilities. 
Remember, too, that you need to have a positive, confident 
attitude. Yes, you’ll make mistakes. Everyone does — as a 
matter of fact, many native Spanish speakers do all the time. 
Your main goal should be to write and speak as well as you 
can; if you trip up and conjugate a verb incorrectly or use the 
feminine form of an adjective rather than the masculine form, 
it isn’t the end of the world. If you can make yourself under-
stood, you’ve won the greatest part of the battle.


Chapter 1
Brushing Up on the Basics
In This Chapter
▶ Counting with cardinal and ordinal numbers
▶ Expressing dates
▶ Telling time
▶ Reviewing parts of speech
K
nowing numbers, expressing dates, relating the time 
of day, and recognizing parts of speech are essential 
Spanish skills you need in everyday life. Surely, the ability 
to communicate numbers, times, and dates is completely 
indispensable to you on a daily basis. Determining the correct 
part of speech to use helps you perfect your oral and written 
Spanish.
Counting Down
We start off this chapter with numbers because you need 
them in order to express dates and tell time. You use cardinal 
numbers (the more popular of the two) to count, to bargain 
with a merchant about a price, to express the temperature, 
or to write a check. You use ordinal numbers to express the 
number of a floor, the act of a play, or the order of a person in 
a race or competition.
Using cardinal numbers
You use cardinal numbers many times every day. As a matter 
of fact, you probably use them at least once an hour in the 
course of normal conversation or in writing. The Spanish car-
dinal numbers are as follows:

You need to keep the following rules in mind when using car-
dinal numbers in Spanish:
 
✓ Uno (one), used only when counting, becomes un before 
a masculine noun and una before a feminine noun, 
whether the noun is singular or plural:
 
• uno, dos, tres (one, two, three)
 
• un niño y una niña (a boy and a girl)
 
• sesenta y un dólares (61 dollars)
 
• veintiuna (veinte y una) personas (21 people)
 
✓ You use the conjunction y (and) only for numbers 
between 16 and 99. You don’t use it directly after 
hundreds:
 
• ochenta y ocho (88)
 
• doscientos treinta y siete (237)
 
✓ You generally write the numbers 16 through 19 and 21 
through 29 as one word. The numbers 16, 22, 23, and 26 
have accents on the last syllable:
 
• 16: dieciséis
 
• 22: veintidós
 
• 23: veintitrés
 
• 26: veintiséis
 
✓ When used before a masculine noun, veintiún (21) has 
an accent on the last syllable:
 
• veintiún días (21 days)
 
✓ Ciento (100) becomes cien before nouns of either gender 
and before the numbers mil and millones. Before all 
other numbers, you use ciento. Un (one), which you 
don’t use before cien(to) or mil, comes before millón. 
When a noun follows millón, you put the preposition de 
between millón and the noun. Millón drops its accent in 
the plural (millones):
 
• cien sombreros (100 hats)
 
• cien blusas (100 blouses)
 
• cien mil millas (100,000 miles)
 
• cien millones de dólares (100 million dollars)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
8
 
• ciento noventa acres (190 acres)
 
• mil posibilidades (1,000 possibilities)
 
• un millón de razones (1 million reasons)
 
✓ Compounds of ciento (doscientos, trescientos) must 
change to agree with a feminine noun:
 
• cuatrocientos muchachos (400 muchachos)
 
• seiscientas muchachas (600 muchachas)
 
With numerals and decimals, Spanish uses commas where 
English uses periods, and vice versa:

Using ordinal numbers
You use ordinal numbers — those used to express numbers in 
a series — far less frequently than cardinal numbers, but they 
still have some very important applications in everyday life. 
The following chart presents the Spanish ordinal numbers:

The following list outlines everything you must remember 
when using ordinal numbers in Spanish:

 Chapter 1: Brushing Up on the Basics
9
 
✓ Spanish speakers rarely use ordinal numbers after 10th. 
After that, they usually use cardinal numbers in both the 
spoken and written language:
 
 El siglo quince (the 15th century)
 
✓ Ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or 
feminine) with the nouns they modify. You can make 
ordinal numbers feminine by changing the final -o of the 
masculine form to -a:
 
 la cuarta vez (the fourth time)
 
✓ Primero and tercero drop the final -o before a masculine 
singular noun:
 
 el primer muchacho (the first boy)
 
 el tercer hombre (the third man)
 
✓ In dates, primero is the only ordinal number you use. All 
other dates call for the cardinal numbers:
 
 el primero de mayo (May 1st)
 
 el doce de enero (January 12th)
Dealing with Dates
Dates are important parts of everyday life (in more ways than 
one!). To write out dates in Spanish, you have to practice the 
days of the week, the months of the year, and numbers (see 
the preceding section).
Expressing the days of the week
If you hear ¿Qué día es hoy? (What day is it?), you should 
respond with Hoy es . . . (Today is . . .) and then provide the 
name of one of the days listed here:
English
Spanish
Monday
lunes
Tuesday
martes
Wednesday
miércoles
Thursday
jueves
Friday
viernes
Saturday
sábado
Sunday
domingo

Unlike the English calendar, the Spanish calendar starts with 
Monday.
 
Here are two more guidelines for talking about days of the 
week in Spanish:
 
✓ Unless you use them at the beginning of a sentence, you 
don’t capitalize the days of the week in Spanish:
 
 Lunes y martes son días de vacaciones. (Monday and 
Tuesday are vacation days.)
 
✓ You use el to express on when referring to a particular 
day of the week and los to express on when the action 
occurs repeatedly:
 
 No trabajo el sábado. (I’m not working on Saturday.)
 
 No trabajo los sábados. (I don’t work on Saturdays.)
Naming the months of the year
If you hear ¿En qué mes . . .? (In what month . . .), someone is 
asking you in what month a certain event takes place. We pro-
vide the names of the months in Spanish in the following list:
English
Spanish
January
enero
February

March

April

May
mayo
June
junio
July
julio
August
agosto
September
septiembre (or setiembre)
October
octubre
November
noviembre
December
diciembre

 Chapter 1: Brushing Up on the Basics 11
 
Like days of the week, the months aren’t capitalized in 
Spanish:
Junio y julio son meses agradables. (June and July are 
nice months.)
Along with the months, you may also want to talk about the 
seasons of the year. In Spanish, the seasons are masculine 
except for la primavera (the spring):
el invierno (the winter)
la primavera (the spring)
el verano (the summer)
el otoño (the autumn [fall])
Making a date
If you want to ask a passerby or an acquaintance about the 
date, politely inquire ¿Cuál es la fecha de hoy? (What is 
today’s date?) The person should respond with Hoy es . . . 
(Today is . . .) and then use the following formula to express 
the correct date:
day + (el) + cardinal number (except for primero) + de + 
month + de + year
The following is an example translation, using this formula:
Sunday, April 18, 2010: Hoy es domingo, el dieciocho de 
abril de dos mil diez.
 
Now that you have a handy formula, you need to know a few 
more details about writing dates in Spanish:
 
✓ You express the first day of each month with primero. 
You use cardinal numbers for all other days:
 
 el primero de enero (January 1st)
 
 el siete de enero (January 7th)
 
✓ Use el to express on with Spanish dates:
 
 Partimos el once de octubre. (We are leaving on 
October 11th.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
12
 
✓ In Spanish, you express years in thousands and hundreds, 
not only in hundreds:
 
 1492: mil cuatrocientos noventa y dos (fourteen hundred 
ninety-two)
 
In Spanish, when dates are written as numbers, they follow 
the sequence day/month/year, which may prove confusing to 
English speakers — especially for dates below the 12th of the 
month. You write February 9th as 2/9 in English, but in Spanish 
it’s 9/2.
When speaking of dates in everyday language, the words and 
expressions that follow may come in handy:

Telling Time
Knowing how to understand, speak, and write time-related 
words and phrases is a must for anyone who’s studying a for-
eign language and planning to put these studies to use (to do 
some traveling one day, for instance).

 Chapter 1: Brushing Up on the Basics 13
If you hear ¿Qué hora es? (What time is it?), someone wants 
to know the time. You should start by responding with the 
following:
Es la una + 1 o’clock hour or Son las + any time after 1.
To express the time after the hour (up to and including half 
past the hour), use y (and) and the number of minutes. Use 
menos (less) + the number of the following hour to express 
the time before the next hour (after half past the hour).
You can also express time numerically (as shown in the third 
example here):
Es la una y media. (It’s 1:30.)
Son las cinco menos veinte. (It’s 4:40.)
Son las cuatro y cuarenta. (It’s 4:40.)
If you want to discuss at what time a particular event will 
occur, you can use a question — ¿A qué hora . . . ? — or 
answer with A la una or A las + any time after 1:
¿A qué hora vienen? (At what time are they coming?)
A la una. (At 1:00.)
A las tres y cuarto. (At 3:15.)
The following chart shows how to express time after and 
before the hour:

Focusing on Parts of Speech
Too many people try to translate word for word from English 
to Spanish. And that just doesn’t work. Why? Because a 
Spanish word may have many applications depending on 
its usage (for example, as a noun or as an adjective) in the 
sentence. In addition, many idiomatic phrases, when used 
properly, distinguish a native speaker from someone who’s 
unfamiliar with the language. (An idiomatic phrase is a phrase 

 Chapter 1: Brushing Up on the Basics 15
used in a particular language whose meaning can’t easily be 
understood by a literal translation of its component words. 
An English example is “It’s raining cats and dogs.”)
Using nouns
A noun is the part of speech that refers to a person, place, 
thing, quality, idea, or action. Here are some examples of 
nouns in action:
 
✓ Person: The boy is friendly. (El muchacho es amable.)
 
✓ Place: I want to go home. (Quiero ir a casa.)
 
✓ Thing: I would like to see that book. (Quisiera ver ese 
libro.)
 
✓ Quality: I admire her courage. (Admiro su coraje.)
 
✓ Idea: Communism is a political theory. (El comunismo es 
una teoría política.)
 
✓ Action: The plane’s departure is imminent. (La partida del 
avión es inminente.)
In everyday speaking/writing, you use nouns most often in the 
following forms:
 
✓ As the subject of a verb:
 
 María speaks Spanish. (María habla español.)
 
✓ As the direct object of a verb:
 
 I see María. (Yo veo a María.)
 
✓ As the indirect object of a verb:
 
 I speak to María. (Yo le hablo a María.)
 
✓ As the object of a preposition:
 
 I went out with María. (Yo salí con María.)
 
Unlike English nouns, all Spanish nouns have a gender: mas-
culine or feminine. All words you use to qualify or describe 
a noun must agree with the noun with respect to gender. We 
discuss this in more detail in Chapter 2.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
16
Substituting pronouns
A pronoun is a part of speech used in place of a noun. The fol-
lowing list outlines the pronouns we discuss in this book:
 
✓ Subject pronouns (see Chapter 3) are followed by the verb 
expressing the main action in the sentence (I, you, he, 
she, it, we, they):
 
 You are nice. (Ud. es simpático.)
 
✓ Interrogative pronouns (see Chapter 5) ask a question 
(who, which, what, and so on):
 
 Who is that? (¿Quién es?)
 
✓ Direct object pronouns (see Chapter 2) replace direct 
object nouns; they answer whom or what the subject is 
acting upon. The direct object pronouns are me, te, lo, la 
(le in Spain), nos, (os in Spain), los, and las (les in Spain):
 
 I’ll be seeing you. (Te veo.)
 
✓ Indirect object pronouns (see Chapter 2) replace indirect 
object nouns; they explain to or for whom something is 
done. They include me, te, le, nos, (os in Spain), and les:
 
 He wrote to me. (Me escribió.)
 
✓ Reflexive pronouns (see Chapter 3) show that the subject 
is acting upon itself (me, te, se, nos, [os in Spain]):
 
 He sees himself in the mirror. (Él se ve en el espejo.)
 
✓ Prepositional pronouns (see Chapter 4) are used after 
prepositions (mí, ti, él, ella, Ud., nosotros, vosotros (in 
Spain), ellos, ellas, Uds.):
 
 They’re going to the movies without me. (Van al cine 
sin mí.)
Acting with verbs
A verb is a part of speech that shows an action or a state of 
being. In Spanish, as in English, verbs change from their infini-
tive form (they’re conjugated, in other words) as follows:
 
✓ To agree with the person performing the action (I, you, 
he, she, it, we, they)

 Chapter 1: Brushing Up on the Basics 17
 
✓ To indicate the time when the action was performed 
(past, present, future)
 
✓ To indicate the mood (indicative, subjunctive, impera-
tive, conditional) of the action
 
The infinitive of the verb is its “raw” form — its “to” form — 
before it’s conjugated. Infinitives in Spanish have three differ-
ent endings, and you conjugate them according to these end-
ings (-ar, -er, and -ir) when a subject is present or is implied. 
We give you lots more information about verbs in Chapters 3, 
6, 7, and 8.
Describing with adjectives
An adjective is a part of speech that describes a noun:
The house is white. (La casa es blanca.)
A Spanish adjective can have other applications, too, which 
we outline in the following list:
 
✓ A possessive adjective tells to whom the noun belongs:
 
 It’s my book. (Es mi libro.)
 
✓ A demonstrative adjective shows this, that, these, or those:
 
 That film is good. (Esa película es buena.)
 
✓ An interrogative adjective asks the question whose, which, 
or what:
 
 Whose car is that? (¿De quién es ese coche?)
 
✓ A number (cardinal or ordinal; see the “Counting Down” 
section earlier in this chapter) is an adjective that gives a 
specific amount:
 
 I need a pen. (Necesito un bolígrafo.)
 
 It’s his tenth birthday. (Es su décimo cumpleaños.)
Clarifying with adverbs
An adverb is a part of speech that modifies a verb, an adjec-
tive, or another adverb:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
18
 
✓ Modifying a verb: You speak quickly. (Ud. habla 
rápidamente.)
 
✓ Modifying an adjective: Her grandmother is very old. (Su 
abuela es muy vieja.)
 
✓ Modifying an adverb: They eat too slowly. (Ellos comen 
demasiado despacio.)
Joining with prepositions
Prepositions are words used before nouns or pronouns to 
relate them to other words in the sentence. Prepositions 
connect the following:
 
✓ Noun to noun: I need that piece of paper. (Necesito esa 
hoja de papel.)
 
✓ Verb to verb: The child begins to laugh. (El niño empieza 
a reír.)
 
✓ Verb to noun: She studies with her friends. (Ella estudia 
con sus amigas.)
 
✓ Verb to pronoun: What do you think about them? (¿Qué 
piensas de ellos?)

Closing the Gender Gap
In This Chapter
▶ Specifying with definite articles
▶ Generalizing with indefinite articles
▶ Demonstrating with adjectives
▶ Selecting a gender
▶ Being possessive
▶ Using object pronouns
L
et the battle of the sexes begin! Gender is a battle that 
English speakers don’t fight. In English, a noun is simply 
a noun; you don’t have to worry about a noun having a gender 
(a masculine or feminine designation). In Spanish, however, a 
noun has a gender, and the gender of a noun very often deter-
mines the spelling of other words in the sentence.
In this chapter, we help you to correctly mark the gender of a 
noun by using definite articles (which express the), indefinite 
articles (which express a, an, or some), or demonstrative 
adjectives (which express this, that, these, or those). You can 
also read up on two different ways to show possession of 
things and how to replace direct and indirect object nouns 
with their respective pronouns.
Being Specific with 
Definite Articles
A definite article expresses the English word the and indicates 
a specific person or thing, such as “the boy” or “the book.” 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
20
You must choose the correct definite article to “mark” a noun 
in order to say the.
Identifying the definite articles
Spanish features four distinct definite articles that correspond 
to the in English. The following table lists these articles:
Masculine
Feminine
Singular
el
la
Plural
los
las
Here are some examples of these definitive articles in action:
El muchacho es grande. (The boy is big.)
Los libros son interesantes. (The books are interesting.)
La muchacha es alta. (The girl is tall.)
Las casas son blancas. (The houses are white.)
Using definite articles
You come across many instances in Spanish where you use 
the definite article even though you may or may not use it in 
English. The rules in the following list show how you use the 
definite articles in Spanish:
 
✓ With nouns in a general or abstract sense:
 
• El amor es divino. (Love is divine.)
 
✓ With nouns in a specific sense:
 
• La tía María trae regalos. (Aunt María brings gifts.)
 
✓ With names of languages (except after the verb hablar 
and after the prepositions de and en):
 
• Me gusta el español. (I like Spanish.)
 
• ¿Dónde está mi libro de español? (Where’s my 
Spanish book?)
 
• Escríbame en español. (Write to me in Spanish.)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 21
 
✓ With parts of the body (when the possessor is clear) in 
place of the possessive adjective:
 
• Me duelen los pies. (My feet hurt.)
 
✓ With titles and ranks when you aren’t addressing the 
person:
 
• La señora Rivera está aquí. (Mrs. Rivera is here.)
 
• Siéntese, Señora Rivera. (Have a seat, Mrs. Rivera.)
 
✓ With last names:
 
• Los Gómez viven en Colombia. (The Gómezes live 
in Colombia.)
 
✓ With days of the week (except after the verb ser):
 
• El domingo voy a México. (On Sunday I’m going to 
Mexico.)
 
• Hoy es miércoles. (Today is Wednesday.)
 
✓ With seasons (you may omit the article after en):
 
• No trabajo en (el) verano. (I don’t work in the 
summer.)
 
✓ With dates:
 
• Es el cinco de mayo. (It’s May 5th.)
 
✓ With the hour of the day and other time expressions:
 
• Son las once y media. (It’s 11:30.)
 
• Salgo por la tarde. (I’m going out in the afternoon.)
 
✓ With the names of many cities and countries (though 
there’s a tendency to omit the article in current usage):
 
• el Brasil, el Ecuador, El Escorial, el Paraguay, el 
Perú, El Salvador, el Uruguay, la Argentina, la 
China, La Habana, la India, La Paz, los Estados 
Unidos
 
• Visitamos (el) Brasil. (We visited Brazil.)
 
 Capitalized articles are actually parts of the names of 
the countries, whereas  articles in lowercase are not. For 
example, Yo nací en El Salvador pero pasé muchos años 
en la Argentina. (I was born in El Salvador but I spent 
many years in Argentina.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
22
 
✓ With rivers, seas, and other geographical locations:
 
• El Orinoco es un río. (The Orinoco is a river.)
 
The definite article precedes the noun it modifies and agrees 
with that noun in number and gender. For example, El mucha-
cho es rubio y las muchachas son morenas. (The boy is blond 
and the girls are brunette.)
Omitting the definite articles
You omit the definite articles in the following situations in 
Spanish:
 
✓ Before nouns in apposition (when one noun explains 
another):
 
 Madrid, capital de España, es una ciudad popular. 
(Madrid, the capital of Spain, is a popular city.)
 
✓ Before numerals that express the title of rulers:
 
 Carlos Quinto (Charles the Fifth)
Contracting with definite articles
Spanish features only two contractions. They occur when the 
definite article el is joined with the preposition a (a + el = al) 
or de (de + el = del). The only exception to the rule is when 
the definite article is part of the title or name. Here are some 
examples of this construction:
Voy al Uruguay. (I’m going to Uruguay.) Voy a El 
Salvador. (I’m going to El Salvador.)
Soy del Uruguay. (I’m from Uruguay.) Soy de El Salvador. 
(I’m from El Salvador.)
Being General with 
Indefinite Articles
An indefinite article, which expresses the English words a, an, 
or some, refers to persons or objects not specifically identified 

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 23
(such as “a boy” or “some books”). Just like with definite arti-
cles, when you know whether a noun is masculine or feminine 
(and singular or plural), you can choose the correct indefinite 
article to mark that noun.
Identifying the indefinite articles
Four Spanish indefinite articles correspond to a, an, and one 
in the singular and to some in the plural. The following table 
presents these articles:
Masculine
Feminine
Singular
un
una
Plural
unos
unas
Here are some examples of the indefinite articles in action:
Compré un abrigo. (She bought an [one] overcoat.)
Es una mujer muy astuta. (She is a very astute woman.)
Necesito unos limones y unas limas. (I need some lemons 
and some limes.)
 
As with definite articles, the indefinite article precedes the 
noun it modifies and agrees with that noun in number and 
gender.
Omitting indefinite articles
You omit the indefinite article from your Spanish construc-
tions in the following situations:
 
✓ Before unmodified nouns that express nationality, profes-
sion, or religious or political affiliation:
 
• El señor Robles es profesor. (Mr. Robles is a 
teacher.)
 
 However, you use the indefinite article when the noun is 
modified:
 
• El señor Robles es un profesor liberal. (Mr. Robles 
is a liberal teacher.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
24
 
✓ Before the following nouns:
 
• cien (one hundred): cien niños (one hundred children)
 
• cierto (certain): ciertos idiomas (certain languages)
 
• mil (one thousand): mil dólares (one thousand 
dollars)
 
• otro (other): otra clase (another class)
 
• qué (what a): qué lástima (what a pity)
 
• semejante (similar): problema semejante (a similar 
problem)
 
• tal (such a): tal cosa (such a thing)
Being Demonstrative 
with Adjectives
Personally, we’re not content with just anything or anyone; 
we like to make our requirements and needs known! We do so 
by specifically referring to this, that, these, or those things or 
people. If you’re like us, you need to make use of the Spanish 
demonstrative adjectives that enable you to express exactly 
what or whom you’re seeking.
Demonstrative adjectives indicate or point out the person, 
place, or thing to which a speaker is referring, such as “this 
shirt” or “that pair of pants.” Demonstrative adjectives pre-
cede and agree in number and gender with the nouns they 
modify. In Spanish, you select the demonstrative adjective 
according to the distance of the noun from the speaker. 
Table 2-1 presents demonstrative adjectives and addresses 
this distance issue.

ahí. (I have to speak to that girl and those boys there.)
Aquellos países son grandes y aquellas ciudades son 
pequeñas. (Those countries are large and those cities are 
small.)
 
Here’s what you need to know about demonstrative adjectives 
in Spanish:
 
✓ You use them before each noun:
 
• este abogado y ese cliente (this lawyer and that 
client)
 
✓ You can use adverbs to reinforce location:
 
• esta casa aquí (this house here)
 
• esas casas ahí (those houses there)
 
• aquella casa allá (that house over there)
Clarifying Gender
Spanish nouns are either masculine or feminine. Nouns that 
refer to males are always masculine, and nouns that refer 
to females are feminine, no matter their endings. You can’t 
always be sure when it comes to places or things, though.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
26
Determining the gender of nouns
In Spanish, certain endings are good indications as to the 
gender (masculine or feminine designation) of nouns. For 
instance, nouns that end in -o (except la mano [the hand] and 
la radio [the radio]) often are masculine. Nouns that end in 
-a, -ad (la ciudad [city]), -ie (la serie [the series]), -ción (la 
canción [the song]), -sión (la discusión [discussion]), -ud (la 
salud [health]), and -umbre (la costumbre [custom]) generally 
are feminine.
Here are more rules that deal with gender in Spanish:
 
✓ Certain nouns belonging to a theme are masculine. These 
include
 
• Numbers: el cuatro (four)
 
• Days of the week: el jueves (Thursday)
 
• Compass points: el norte (north)
 
• Names of trees: el manzano (apple tree)
 
• Some compound nouns: el sacapuntas (pencil 
sharpener)
 
• Names of rivers, lakes, mountains, straits, and seas: 
el Mediterráneo (the Mediterranean)
 
✓ Certain nouns belonging to a theme are feminine. These 
include
 
• Many illnesses: la gripe (the flu), la apendicitis 
(appendicitis)
 
• Islands and provinces: la Córsega (Corsica)
Reversing gender
Some Spanish nouns are tricky because they end in -a but 
are masculine, while others end in -o but are feminine. 
These nouns may be referred to as reverse-gender nouns. For 
instance, some nouns that end in -ma and -eta are masculine, 
as are the words el día (the day) and el mapa (the map). The 
following table outlines these masculine words:

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 27
-ma
-eta
el clima (the climate)
el planeta (the planet)
el drama (the drama)
el idioma (the language)
el poema (the poem)
el problema (the problem)
el programa (the program)
el sistema (the system)
el telegrama (the telegram)
el tema (the theme)
Here are a couple of nouns that end in -o and are feminine:
 
✓ la mano (the hand)
 
✓ la radio (the radio)
 
Note that la foto is the abbreviation for la fotografía (the 
photograph) and la moto is the abbreviation for la motocicleta 
(the motorcycle).
Using the same noun 
for both genders
Some nouns have the same spelling for both genders. For 
these nouns, all you have to do is change the definite article 
to reflect whether the person in question is male or female. 
The following table presents the most common of these 
nouns:
Masculine
Feminine
Translation
el artista
la artista
the artist
el dentista
la dentista
the dentist
el periodista
la periodista
the journalist
el telefonista
la telefonista
the operator
el modelo
la modelo
the model
el joven
la joven
the youth
el estudiante
la estudiante
the student
 
The following nouns, however, always remain feminine, 
regardless of the gender of the person being described:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
28
 
✓ la persona (the person)
 
✓ la víctima (the victim)
Changing the meaning of nouns
Some nouns change meaning according to their gender. A 
noun in this category can mean one thing in the masculine 
form but have a totally different meaning in the feminine form. 
Knowing the proper usage is the difference between pray-
ing to the Pope or to a potato! You simply must memorize 
nouns in this category. The following table presents some of 
the high-frequency Spanish words whose meanings change 
according to gender:
Masculine

Understanding special nouns
When it comes to languages, you can always find some excep-
tions to the rule. In Spanish, for instance, masculine nouns 
that refer to people and end in -or, -és, or -n require the addi-
tion of a final -a to get the female equivalent. And if the mascu-
line noun has an accented final syllable, you drop that accent 
in the feminine form. Here are some examples:
el profesor → la profesora (the teacher)
el francés → la francesa (the French person)
el alemán → la alemana (the German person)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 29
 
Of course, you must watch out for two exceptions to this rule:
 
✓ el actor (the actor) → la actriz (the actress)
 
✓ el emperador (the emperor) → la emperatriz (the 
empress)
Some nouns have distinct masculine and feminine forms. 
The following table presents a list of these nouns, which you 
simply have to memorize:
Masculine
Meaning
Feminine
Meaning
el héroe
the hero
la heroína
the heroine
el hombre
the man
la mujer
the woman
el marido
the husband
la esposa
the wife
el príncipe
the prince
la princesa
the princess
el rey
the king
la reina
the queen
el yerno
the son-in-law
la nuera
the daughter-
in-law
 
To prevent the clash of two vowel sounds, the Spanish lan-
guage uses the masculine singular article el (un) with feminine 
singular nouns that begin with a stressed a sound (a- or ha-). 
In the plural, you use las (unas) for these nouns. Here are 
some commonly used words with this designation:
el agua (the water); las aguas (the waters)
el ave (the bird); las aves (the birds)
el hambre (the hunger); las hambres (the hungers)
Forming Plural Nouns
You use noun plurals to refer to more than one person, place, 
thing, quality, idea, or action. Not surprisingly, just as you do 
in English, you use the letters -s and -es to form the plurals 
of Spanish nouns. The following list outlines the many plural 
variations you see in Spanish nouns and the rules for forming 
plurals:
 
✓ You add -s to form the plural of nouns ending in a vowel:
 
• el mango (the mango); los mangos (the mangoes)
 
• la manzana (the apple); las manzanas (the apples)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
30
 
✓ You add -es to form the plural of nouns ending in a con-
sonant (including -y):
 
• el emperador (the emperor); los emperadores (the 
emperors)
 
• el rey (the king); los reyes (the kings)
 
✓ You add or delete an accent mark in some nouns ending 
in -n or -s to maintain the original stress:
 
• el examen; los exámenes (the tests)
 
• la canción; las canciones (the songs)
 
• el francés; los franceses (the Frenchmen)
 
• el inglés; los ingleses (the Englishmen)
 
• el limón; los limones (the lemons)
 
✓ Nouns that end in -z change z to -c before you add -es:
 
• la luz (the light); las luces (the lights)
 
✓ Nouns that end in -es or -is don’t change in the plural, 
except for el mes (the month), which becomes los meses 
(the months):
 
• el lunes (Monday); los lunes (Mondays)
 
• la crisis (the crisis); las crisis (the crises)
 
✓ Compound nouns (nouns composed of two nouns that 
join together to make one) don’t change in the plural:
 
• el abrelatas (can opener); los abrelatas (can 
openers)
 
✓ You express the plural of nouns of different genders 
(where one noun is masculine and the other[s] is femi-
nine) with the masculine plural:
 
• el rey y la reina (the king and queen); los reyes (the 
kings or the king[s] and the queen[s])
 
• el muchacho y la muchacha (the boy and the girl); 
los muchachos (the boys or the boy[s] and the 
girl[s])
 
✓ Some nouns are always plural, such as
 
• las gafas/los espejuelos (eyeglasses)
 
• las matemáticas (mathematics)
 
• las vacaciones (vacation)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 31
Showing Possession
The majority of people in the world are possessive of their 
loved ones and their things. You have several ways to express 
possession in Spanish: by using the preposition de (of) or by 
using possessive adjectives before the persons or things. The 
sections that follow guide you through the ways you can stake 
your claims.
Using de
 
Expressing possession by using the preposition de (of) 
is quite unlike what people are accustomed to in English. 
English speakers put an apostrophe + s after the noun rep-
resenting the possessor: John’s family, for instance. Spanish 
nouns have no apostrophe s; you must use a reverse word 
order joined by the preposition de. The following list presents 
the rules of using de:
 
✓ You use the preposition de between a noun that’s pos-
sessed and a proper noun representing the possessor:
 
 Es el coche de Julio. (It’s Julio’s car.)
 
✓ You use de + a definite article between the noun that’s 
possessed and a common noun representing the 
possessor:
 
 Tengo el abrigo de la muchacha. (I have the girl’s coat.)
 
✓ De contracts with the definite article el to form del (of 
the) before a masculine singular common noun:
 
 Necesito el libro del profesor. (I need the teacher’s 
book.)
 
✓ If the sentence contains more than one possessor, you 
need to repeat de before each noun:
 
 Voy a la casa de Roberto y de Marta. (I’m going to 
Roberto and Marta’s house.)
 
✓ You use a construction that’s the reverse of English to 
answer the question “¿De quién es . . .?”:
 
 ¿De quién(es) es la idea? (Whose idea is it?)
 
 Es la idea de Julia y del hermano de Julia. (It is Julia’s 
and her brother’s idea.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
32
Employing possessive adjectives
You use a possessive adjective before the noun that’s pos-
sessed in order to express my, your, his, her, its, our, or their. 
Possessive adjectives must agree in gender and number 
(singular or plural) with the objects that are possessed; they 
never agree with the possessors. Table 2-2 outlines the pos-
sessive adjectives:
Table 2-2 
Possessive Adjectives

sus
Here are some example sentences:
Yo perdí mis gafas. (I lost my glasses.)
Nosotros escuchamos a nuestro profesor. (We listen to 
our teacher.)
 
Because su can mean his, her, or their, you can clarify who the 
possessor really is by replacing the possessive adjective (su) 
with the corresponding definite article (el, la, los, or las) + 
noun + de + él (ellos, ella, ellas, Ud., Uds.):
I need his (her) help.
Necesito su ayuda.
Necesito la ayuda de él (ella).
 
With parts of the body or clothing, you replace the possessive 
adjective with the correct definite article when the possessor 
is clear:
Me cepillo los dientes dos veces al día. (I brush my teeth 
twice a day.)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 33
Substituting with 
Object Pronouns
An object pronoun is a replacement word for an object noun. 
This pronoun helps you avoid unnecessary, continuous 
repetition of the noun, which allows for a more colloquial, 
free-flowing conversational tone when you’re speaking or 
writing. Don’t be tricked by these pronouns, though; always 
remember that the verb in your sentence must agree with the 
subject pronoun. The following sections walk you through the 
world of object pronouns.
Dealing with direct 
object pronouns
Direct object nouns or pronouns answer the question “Whom 
or what is the subject acting upon?” Direct objects may refer 
to people, places, things, or ideas. A direct object pronoun 
simply replaces a direct object noun and agrees with it in 
number and gender.
In both English and Spanish, a direct object noun follows the 
subject and its verb:
Veo la casa. (I see the house.)
Unlike in English, however, you usually place a Spanish direct 
object pronoun before the conjugated verb:
La veo. (I see it.)
Table 2-3 lists the direct object pronouns in Spanish.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies

Here are some example sentences that show how you use 
Spanish direct object pronouns:
Él me comprende. (He understands me.)
¿Nos ve Ud.? (Do you see us?)
¿Los periódicos? Yo los leo cada día. (The newspapers? 
I read them every day.)
 
People often use le rather than lo in Spain to express you 
(masculine) or him. Lo is used as a direct object pronoun in 
Spanish America. The plural of lo and le is los, which means 
them or you. Here are some examples:
 
✓ Cuido al niño. (I watch the child.)
 
 Lo [Le] cuido. (I watch him.)
 
✓ Cuido a los niños. (I watch the children.)
 
 Los [Les] cuido. (I watch them.)
 
✓ Miro el programa. (I watch the program.)
 
 Lo miro. (I watch it.)
 
✓ Miro los programas. (I watch the programs.)
 
 Los miro. (I watch them.)
Understanding the personal a
In Spanish, the personal a conveys absolutely no meaning and 
is used only before a direct object noun (not before a direct 
object pronoun or any indirect objects) to indicate that it 
refers to a person or a beloved pet. The following list explains 
in more detail how to use the personal a:
 
✓ You use the personal a before a common or proper noun 
that refers to a person or persons. The personal a com-
bines with the definite article el to form the contraction 
al, but it doesn’t combine with the other definite articles:
 
 No conozco a ellas. (I don’t know them.)
 
 Busco al señor Gómez. (I’m looking for Mr. Gómez.)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 35
 
✓ You use the personal a before the name of your pooch, 
tabby, hamster, turtle, or other pet:
 
 Adiestró a Fido. (She tamed Fido.)
 
✓ You use the personal a before a pronoun that refers to a 
person:
 
 No espero a nadie. (I’m not waiting for anyone.)
 
You don’t, however, use the personal a with the verb tener (to 
have):
Tengo dos hermanos. (I have two brothers.)
Coping with indirect 
object pronouns
Indirect object nouns or pronouns refer only to people (and to 
beloved pets); they answer the question “To or for whom is 
the subject doing something?” An indirect object pronoun can 
replace an indirect object noun but also is used in Spanish 
when the indirect object noun is mentioned. The indirect 
object pronoun never agrees in gender with the noun to which 
it refers. And just like with direct object pronouns, indirect 
object pronouns generally are placed before the  conjugated 
verb. For example:
Le escribo un e-mail. (I’m writing an e-mail to him.)
Le escribo a Gloria un e-mail. (I’m writing an e-mail to 
Gloria.)
Table 2-4 presents the indirect object pronouns in Spanish.

The following sentences show how you use indirect object 
pronouns:
¿Me dices la verdad? (Are you telling me the truth?)
La mujer nos ofrece un refresco. (The lady offers us a 
drink.)
Les doy un abrazo. (I give them a hug.)
 
A clue that may indicate that you need an indirect object pro-
noun is the use of the preposition a (al, a la, a los, or a las), 
which means to or for (unlike the personal a, which has no 
meaning — see the preceding section), followed by the name 
of or reference to a person. You may use a él, a ella, or a Ud. 
or the person’s name to clarify to whom you’re referring:
 
✓ Yo le escribo a Rosa. (I write to Rosa.)
 
 Yo le escribo. (I write to her.)
 
✓ Ella le habla al muchacho. (She speaks to the boy.)
 
 Ella le habla. (She speaks to him.)
 
✓ Ella le habla a él. (She speaks to him.)
 
 Ella le habla a Juan. (She speaks to Juan.)
 
Although you may use the prepositions to and for in English, 
you omit these prepositions in Spanish sentences before an 
indirect object pronoun:
Te compro un regalo. (I’m buying a present for you; I’m 
buying you a present.)
Me escriben. (They are writing to me; they are writing me.)
Choosing the proper pronoun
Sometimes people get confused when trying to figure out 
whether to use a direct object pronoun or an indirect object 
pronoun. The good news is you’ll have absolutely no problem 
with me, te, nos, and os because they act as both direct and 
indirect object pronouns. They’re also reflexive pronouns 
(see Chapter 3):
Me respeta. (He respects me.)
Me dice un secreto. (He tells me a secret.)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 37
Nos visita. (She visits us.)
Nos trae flores. (She brings us flowers.)
 
Here’s one tip: If you can use the word to or for in an English 
sentence before a reference to a person — no matter how 
awkward the construction may seem — you must use an indi-
rect object pronoun in your Spanish sentence:
Quiero mostrarte esta foto. (I want to show [to] you this 
photo.)
The following sections give you some more insider tips that 
can help you decide between direct and indirect object pro-
nouns.
Common Spanish verbs requiring a direct object
Verbs that require an indirect object in English may require 
a direct object in Spanish because to or for is included in the 
meaning of the infinitive. (Remember that any a you see will 
be the personal a; check out “Understanding the personal a” 
earlier in this chapter.) Some of these high-frequency verbs 
include the following:
 
✓ buscar (to look for)
 
✓ escuchar (to listen to)
 
✓ esperar (to wait for)
 
✓ llamar (to call)
 
✓ mirar (to look at)
The following examples illustrate how you use these verbs:
Nosotros esperamos a nuestros amigos. (We are waiting 
for our friends.)
Nosotros los esperamos. (We are waiting for them.)
Common Spanish verbs requiring an indirect object
Verbs that require a direct object in English don’t necessar-
ily require a direct object in Spanish. The verbs that follow 
take indirect objects in Spanish, regardless of the object used 
in English. This is because to or for is implied when speaking 
about a person or because the verb generally is followed by 
the preposition a:

acompañar (to accompany)
obedecer (to obey)
aconsejar (to advise)
ofrecer (to offer)
contar (to relate, tell)
pedir (to ask)
contestar (to answer)

dar (to give)
presentar (to introduce)

prohibir (to forbid)
escribir (to write)
prometer (to promise)

telefonear (to call)
mandar (to send)
Here are a few examples:
Te aconsejo practicar más. (I advise you to practice more.)
Ella le pide disculpa a su amiga. (She asks her friend for 
an apology.)
Doing an about face with gustar
Verbs like gustar require special attention because although 
you can say I like in English, in Spanish you have to say that 
something is pleasing to you. This rule means that Spanish 
sentences appear somewhat backward to English speakers and 
that because something is pleasing “to” the subject, gustar 
and verbs like it require the use of an indirect object pronoun. 
Note how the English and Spanish sentences convey the same 
meaning but are expressed in a totally different fashion:
English: I like chocolate.
Spanish: Chocolate is pleasing to me.
The following table presents other Spanish verbs that work 
like gustar:

to remain to someone, have left
Here are some examples that show how you use these verbs 
in Spanish sentences. Note that the subject is now at the end 
of the sentence and the verb must agree with the subject:
¿Te gustan los deportes? (Do you like sports? Literally: 
Are sports pleasing to you?)
Nos interesa viajar. (We are interested in traveling. 
Literally: Traveling is interesting to us.)
 
You use the third-person singular form of any verb from the 
previous list with one or more infinitives:
Me gusta cantar. (I like to sing.)
Me gusta cantar y bailar. (I like to sing and dance.)
The following list presents some more details you should 
know about using these verbs:
 
✓ An indirect object pronoun may be preceded by the 
preposition a + the corresponding prepositional 
pronoun — mí, ti, él, ella, Ud, nosotros, vosotros, ellos, 
ellas, Uds. — for stress or clarification (see Chapter 4):
 
 A mí me parece claro. (It seems clear to me.)
 
✓ An indirect object pronoun may be preceded by the 
preposition a + the indirect object noun:
 
 A Miguel no le gusta trabajar. (Miguel doesn’t like to 
work.)
 
✓ A las niñas les gusta el helado. (The girls like ice cream.)
Positioning object pronouns
How do you decide where to place a direct or indirect object 
pronoun in a Spanish sentence? Generally, you place these 
pronouns before the conjugated verb:
Nosotros los necesitamos. (We need them.)
Siempre les cuentas chistes. (You always tell them jokes.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
40
In sentences with two verbs that follow one subject or in sen-
tences with a present participle (the -ando or -iendo forms; 
see Chapter 3), you have the choice of placing the object pro-
noun before the conjugated verb or after and attached to the 
infinitive or the participle. The following list provides some 
examples of this construction.
 
When you attach the pronoun to the participle, an accent is 
required on the stressed vowel. In general, to correctly place 
the accent, you count back three vowels and add the accent. 
Also, remember that negatives go before the pronoun when it 
precedes the verb.
 
✓ With a present participle:
 
 (No) Lo estoy haciendo. (I’m [not] doing it.)
 
 (No) Estoy haciéndolo. (I’m [not] doing it.)
 
✓ With an infinitive:
 
 (No) Lo quiero hacer. (I [don’t] want to do it.)
 
 (No) Quiero hacerlo. (I [don’t] want to do it.)
 
In a negative command, the object pronoun precedes the 
verb. In an affirmative command, however, the object pro-
noun must follow the verb and be attached to it (for more on 
commands, refer to Chapter 8). The stressed vowel normally 
requires an accent mark (if there are only two vowels, no 
accent is necessary). To properly place the accent, count 
back three vowels and add it.
Here’s what affirmative commands look like:
Prepárela. (Prepare it.)
Hazlo. (Do it.)
Now take a look at the negatives:
No la prepare. (Don’t prepare it.)
No lo hagas. (Don’t do it.)

 Chapter 2: Closing the Gender Gap 41
Doing double duty
Spanish sentences quite commonly require both a direct and 
an indirect object pronoun. You have many rules to consider 
when creating these sentences, as the following list shows:
 
✓ When the verb has two object pronouns, the indirect 
object pronoun (a person) precedes the direct object 
pronoun (usually a thing):
 
• Ella nos muestra las revistas. (She shows us the 
magazines.)
 
 Ella nos las muestra. (She shows them to us.)
 
• Nosotros te damos el boleto. (We give you the 
ticket.)
 
 Nosotros te lo damos. (We give it to you.)
 
✓ When a sentence has two third-person object pronouns, 
the indirect object pronouns le and les change to se 
before the direct object pronouns lo, la, los, and las:
 
• Él les lee las revistas a sus abuelos. (He reads the 
magazines to his grandparents.)
 
 Él se las lee. (He reads them to them.)
 
 To clarify the meaning of se — because it can mean to/for 
you, him, her, and them — you may include the phrase a 
Ud. (Uds.), a él (ellos), or a ella (ellas):
 
 Yo se los digo a él (a ella) (a Uds.). (I tell them to him 
[her] [you/them].)
 
✓ The same rules for the positioning of single object pro-
nouns apply for double object pronouns (see the preced-
ing section). The following examples show how you use 
and place double object pronouns:
 
• With an infinitive, you may place the two separate 
pronouns before the conjugated verb, or you may 
connect and attach them to the end of the infinitive:
 
 (No) Te los quiero mostrar. (I [don’t] want to show 
them to you.)
 
 (No) Quiero mostrártelos. (I [don’t] want to show 
them to you.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
42
 
• With a present participle, you may place the two 
separate pronouns before the conjugated form of 
estar, or you may connect and attach them to the 
end of the gerund:
 
 (No) Se la estoy leyendo a él. (I’m [not] reading it 
to him.)
 
 (No) Estoy leyéndosela a él. (I’m [not] reading it 
to him.)
 
• With commands:
 
 Formal:
 
 Affirmative: Dígamelo. (Tell it to me.)
 
 Negative: No me lo diga. (Don’t tell it to me.)
 
 Informal:
 
 Affirmative: Dímelo. (Tell it to me.)
 
 Negative: No me lo digas. (Don’t tell it to me.)
 
✓ When you attach two pronouns to an infinitive, you gen-
erally count back three vowels and add an accent:
 
 Yo voy a escribírselo a Ud. (I’m going to write it to you.)
 
 When you add two pronouns to a present participle or an 
affirmative command, however, you generally count back 
four vowels when adding an accent:
 
• Estamos comprándoselas a ellos. (We are buying it 
for them.)
 
• Muéstramelo. (Show it to me.)
 
 With a diphthong (two vowels blended together that 
stand for only one vowel sound), you may have to count 
back as many as five vowels:
 
 Tráiganoslos. (Bring them to us.)

M
astering the present tense is incredibly helpful 
because for most people, that’s where the action and 
interest is — in the here and now. In Spanish, you discover 
that the overwhelming majority of present-tense verbs are 
very simple to use because they’re very predictable. However, 
you also find out that some verbs walk to the beat of a differ-
ent drummer; for these verbs, you have to memorize their 
patterns or irregularities.
In this chapter, you form the present and present progressive 
tenses with many types of verbs that enable you to talk and 
write about events and situations that occur now. We also 
give you information on using Spanish subject pronouns.
Identifying Types of Verbs
If you’re going to have any success dealing with Spanish 
verbs, you need to be able to identify which of the five follow-
ing groups a verb belongs to:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
44
 
✓ Regular verbs: These verbs are easy to get along with 
because they follow the regular conjugation rules for -ar, 
-er, and -ir verbs.
 
✓ Stem-changing verbs: These verbs morph depending on 
how you use them in a sentence. You encounter three 
types of stem-changing verbs, classified according to 
their stem changes: e to i, e to ie, and o to ue.
 
✓ Spelling-change verbs: Consonant spelling changes 
occur in some of the conjugated forms of these verbs. 
The changes enable the verbs to comply with pronuncia-
tion rules of the particular letters. The affected conso-
nants are c, g, and z.
 
✓ Irregular verbs: These verbs follow no rules and must be 
memorized.
 
✓ Reflexive verbs: Whenever the subject does something 
to itself, you use a reflexive verb to express the fact that 
the action is performed or “reflected back” onto the sub-
ject of the sentence.
Selecting Subject Pronouns
A subject pronoun is a word used in place of a subject noun. 
This pronoun identifies who or what is performing the action 
of the verb.
I, we, you, he, she, it, and they are the English subject pro-
nouns. They tell the verb who or what is performing the 
action, and they dictate the form of the verb you must use. In 
English, he shops, but they shop.
Spanish uses nine subject pronouns: yo, tú, usted, él, ella; 
nosotros or nosotras; vosotros or vosotras; ustedes; and ellos 
or ellas, as shown in Table 3-1:

Using subject pronouns
Unlike the English subject pronoun I, which is always capi-
talized, the Spanish pronoun yo is capitalized only at the 
beginning of a sentence. You always write the abbreviations 
Ud. and Uds. with capital letters, even though you write 
the English equivalent you with a lowercase letter, unless it 
appears at the beginning of a sentence. When usted and ust-
edes aren’t abbreviated, they’re capitalized only at the begin-
ning of a sentence. Here are some examples:
Yo me voy. (I’m leaving.)
Eduardo y yo salimos. (Edward and I are going out.)
¿Busca Ud. (usted) algo? (Are you looking for something?)
¿Uds. (Ustedes) necesitan ayuda? (Do you need help?)
In the following sections, I present sets of pronouns that 
appear to have the same meaning, and I explain when it’s 
appropriate to use which word.
Tú versus Ud.
You use the familiar subject pronoun tú to address one friend, 
relative, child, or pet, because it’s the informal, singular form 
of you:
Tú eres mi mejor amigo. (You’re my best friend.)
You use Ud. to show respect to an older person or when 
speaking to a stranger or someone you don’t know well, 
because Ud. is the formal, singular form of you:
¿Es Ud. español? (Are you Spanish?)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
46
 
Although usted is usually abbreviated Ud. when written, you 
still pronounce it usted. Likewise, although ustedes is usually 
abbreviated Uds. when written, you still pronounce it ustedes.
Vosotros (vosotras) versus Uds.
Vosotros and vosotras are informal (familiar) plural subject 
pronouns expressing you. The vosotros (vosotras) form is 
used primarily in Spain to address more than one friend, rela-
tive, child, or pet — the informal, plural form of you. You use 
vosotros when speaking to a group of males or to a combined 
group of males and females. You use vosotras only when 
speaking to a group of females:
¿Vosotros me comprendéis? (Do you understand me?)
Uds. is a plural subject pronoun that also expresses you. 
Uds. is used throughout the Spanish-speaking world to show 
respect to more than one older person or when speaking to 
multiple strangers or people you don’t know well. Uds. is the 
formal, plural form of you and replaces the informal, plural 
vosotros (vosotras) in Spanish (Latin, Central, and South) 
America:
Uds. son muy simpáticos. (You are very nice.)
Él versus ella
Él (he) refers to one male person; ella (she) refers to one 
female person:
Él toca la guitarra mientras ella baila. (He plays the guitar 
while she dances.)
Ellos versus ellas
Ellos (they) refers to more than one male or to a combined 
group of males and females, no matter the number of each 
gender present. Ellas refers to a group of females only:
Juan y Jorge (Ellos) escuchan. (Juan and Jorge [They] 
listen.)
Luz y Susana (Ellas) escuchan. (Luz and Susana [They] 
listen.)

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 47
Juan y Luz (Ellos) escuchan. (Juan and Luz [They] listen.)
El niño y mil niñas (Ellos) escuchan. (The boy and 1,000 
girls [They] listen.)
Nosotros (nosotras)
When you’re talking about someone else and yourself at the 
same time, you must use the we (nosotros/nosotras) form of 
the verb. Nosotros refers to more than one male or to a com-
bined group of males and females, no matter the number of 
each gender present. Nosotras refers to a group of females 
only:
Jorge y yo (Nosotros) jugamos al tenis. (Jorge and I [We] 
play tennis.)
Ana y yo (Nosotras) jugamos al tenis. (Ana and I [We] 
play tennis.)
Omitting subject pronouns
In English, you use subject pronouns all the time to explain 
who’s doing what. In Spanish, however, you use subject pro-
nouns a lot less frequently because the verb ending generally 
indicates the subject. If you look ahead to the section that 
follows, you notice that a verb ending in -o must have the sub-
ject yo no matter the infinitive ending (-ar, -er, -ir) because no 
other verb has an -o ending. Hablo español, for instance, can 
only mean I speak Spanish.
If, on the other hand, you see Habla español, it’s unclear 
whether the subject is él (he), ella (she), or Ud. (you) if the 
sentence is taken out of context. When given the context, you 
usually omit the subject pronoun él or ella: Le presento a 
mi amiga Marta. Habla español. (Let me introduce you to my 
friend Marta. She speaks Spanish.)
To avoid confusion, you regularly use the subject pronoun 
Ud. to differentiate between he, she, and you:
¿Habla español? (Do you [he, she] speak Spanish?)
Mi novio habla español. Habla bien. (My boyfriend 
speaks Spanish. He speaks well.)
¿Habla Ud. español? (Do you speak Spanish?)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies

You regularly use the subject pronoun Uds. for sentences in 
the plural to differentiate between they and you:
Cantan bien. (They [You] sing well.)
Mis primos están en el coro. Cantan bien. (My cousins 
are in the chorus. They sing well.)
Uds. cantan bien también. (You sing well, too.)
Communicating in 
the Present Tense
You use the present tense to indicate what a subject is doing 
or does customarily:
Nosotros miramos la televisión cada día. (We watch tele-
vision every day.)
In Spanish, you can also use the present tense to ask for 
instructions or to discuss an action that will take place in the 
future:
¿Preparo la cena ahora? (Shall I prepare dinner now?)
Te veo más tarde. (I’ll see you later.)
You also use the present tense with the verb hacer (to make, 
do) + que to show that an action started in the past and is 
continuing into the present:
¿Cuánto tiempo hace que Ud. estudia el español? (How 
long have you been studying Spanish?)
Hace dos años (que estudio el español). (I’ve been study-
ing Spanish for two years.)
Defining regular verbs
Most verbs are fairly well behaved. They follow the rules. 
They’re predictable, especially in the present tense, which 
makes them fairly easy to master. 

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 49
You probably haven’t heard the word “conjugation” in any of 
your English classes, even when you had those pesky gram-
mar lessons, because people automatically conjugate verbs in 
their native language without even thinking about it. So, what 
exactly do we mean by conjugation? Plain and simple, conjuga-
tion refers to changing the infinitive of a verb (the “to” form — 
to smile, for example) to a form that agrees with the subject. 
“I smile, and he smiles, too.”
In Spanish, all verbs end in -ar, -er, or -ir. Most verbs are regu-
lar, which means that all verbs with the same infinitive ending 
follow the same rules of conjugation. If you memorize the end-
ings for one regular -ar, -er, or -ir infinitive, you can conjugate 
all the other regular verbs within that “family.”
 
Here’s how it works: Take the infinitive and drop its ending 
(-ar, -er, or -ir), and then add the endings for the subject pro-
nouns as indicated in Table 3-2.

Changing verb stems
Some Spanish verbs undergo stem changes — internal changes 
to a vowel to preserve the original sound of the verbs after 
you add a new ending. In the present tense, all stem changes 

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 51
for these verbs occur in the yo, tú, él (ella, Ud.), and 
ellos (ellas, Uds.) forms. You conjugate the nosotros and 
vosotros forms in the normal fashion (their stems resemble 
the infinitive).
Sometimes the conjugation format for stem-changing verbs is 
referred to as the boot because if you were to draw a dark line 
around the forms that have a stem change, they’d resemble a 
boot. Check out Figure 3-1 to see what we mean.

-ar stem changes
Many Spanish verbs with an -ar ending undergo stem changes 
in all forms except nosotros and vosotros. The following list 
details these changes:
 
✓ e → ie: For instance, empezar (to begin) changes to yo 
empiezo (nosotros empezamos). Here are the most fre-
quently used Spanish verbs that fit into this category:
 
• cerrar (to close)
 
• comenzar (to begin)
 
• despertar (to wake up)
 
• pensar (to think)
 
• recomendar (to recommend)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
52
 
✓ o/u → ue: For instance, mostrar (to show) changes to 
yo muestro (nosotros mostramos), and jugar (to play) 
changes to yo juego (nosotros jugamos). Here are the 
most frequently used Spanish verbs that fit into this 
category:
 
• acordar (to agree)
 
• acostar (to put to bed)
 
• almorzar (to eat lunch)
 
• contar (to tell)
 
• costar (to cost)
 
• encontrar (to meet)
 
• probar (to try [on])
 
• recordar (to remember)
 
 Jugar is the only common -ar verb whose stem vowel 
changes from u to ue.
 
You use some verbs with stem changes in the present tense 
impersonally, in the third-person singular only:
Hiela. (It’s freezing.) (helar; e → ie)
Nieva. (It’s snowing.) (nevar; e → ie)
Llueve. (It’s raining.) (llover; o → ue)
Truena. (It’s thundering.) (tronar; o → ue)
-er stem changes
Many Spanish verbs with an -er ending undergo stem changes 
in all forms except nosotros and vosotros. The following list 
details these changes:
 
✓ e → ie: For instance, querer (to wish, want) changes to 
yo quiero (nosotros queremos). Here are the most fre-
quently used Spanish verbs that fit into this category:
 
• entender (to understand)
 
• perder (to lose)

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 53
 
✓ o → ue: For instance, volver (to return) changes to yo 
vuelvo (nosotros volvemos). Here are the most fre-
quently used Spanish verbs that fit into this category:
 
• devolver (to return)
 
• doler (to hurt)
 
• poder (to be able to)
-ir stem changes
Many Spanish verbs with an -ir ending undergo stem changes 
in all forms except nosotros and vosotros. The following list 
outlines these changes:
 
✓ e → ie: For instance, preferir (to prefer) changes to yo 
prefiero (nosotros preferimos). Here are the most fre-
quently used Spanish verbs that fit into this category:
 
• divertir (to amuse)
 
• mentir (to lie)
 
• sentir (to feel, regret)
 
• sugerir (to suggest)
 
✓ o → ue: For instance, dormir (to sleep) changes to yo 
duermo (nosotros  dormimos). Another verb conjugated 
like dormir is morir (to die).
 
✓ e → i (in -ir verbs only): For instance, servir (to serve) 
changes to yo sirvo (nosotros servimos). Here are the 
most frequently used Spanish verbs that fit into this 
category:
 
• despedir (to say goodbye to)
 
• pedir (to ask for)
 
• repetir (to repeat)
 
• vestir (to clothe)
-iar stem change (for some verbs)
Some Spanish verbs with an -iar ending undergo a stem 
change in all forms except nosotros and vosotros. This 
stem change is i → í. For instance, guiar (to guide) changes 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
54
to yo guío (nosotros guiamos). Here are the most frequently 
used Spanish verbs that fit into this category:
 
✓ enviar (to send)
 
✓ esquiar (to ski)
 
✓ fotografiar (to photograph)
-uar stem change (for some verbs)
Some Spanish verbs with a -uar ending undergo a stem change 
in all forms except nosotros and vosotros. This stem change 
is u → ú. For instance, continuar (to continue) changes to 
yo continúo (nosotros continuamos). Habituar (to accustom 
someone to) is another verb that fits into this category.
-uir (not -guir) stem change
Some Spanish verbs with a -uir ending (but not a -guir 
ending) undergo a stem change in all forms except nosotros 
and vosotros. This stem change is adding a y after the u. 
For instance, concluir (to conclude) changes to yo concluyo 
(nosotros concluimos). Here are the most frequently used 
Spanish verbs that fit into this category:
 
✓ contribuir (to contribute)
 
✓ destruir (to destroy)
 
✓ incluir (to include)
Changing the spelling of verbs
Some Spanish verbs undergo spelling changes to preserve the 
original sound of the verbs after you add a new ending. This 
shift is nothing to be overly concerned about because the 
change occurs only in the first-person singular (yo) form of 
the verb. In the present tense, verbs with the endings listed in 
Table 3-3 undergo spelling changes.

Using irregular verbs
In Spanish, some present-tense verbs have irregular forms 
that you must memorize. We cover the three categories of 
irregular present tense verbs in the following sections: those 
that are irregular only in the yo form, those that are irregular 
in all forms except nosotros and vosotros, and those that are 
completely irregular.
Irregular yo forms
In the present tense, some verbs are irregular only in the 
first-person singular (yo) form. You conjugate the other verb 
forms in the regular fashion: by dropping the infinitive ending 
(-ar, -er, or -ir) and adding the ending that corresponds to the 
subject. The following table presents the irregular yo form of 
these verbs:

Recognizing reflexive verbs
Whenever you look at yourself in the mirror or buy yourself 
something at the mall, you’re involved in a reflexive action. 
You, the subject, are doing something to or for yourself. In 
English, reflexive actions become a little fuzzy, because so 
much is considered to be understood. Spanish, however, 
delineates reflexive action by requiring the use of a reflexive 
verb.
When creating a reflexive verb construction, you need a sub-
ject, a reflexive pronoun, and a verb. When you conjugate 
reflexive verbs in English, you place the pronouns in front 
of the conjugated verb. In other words, you say, “You bathe 
yourself.” But in Spanish, the order is you yourself bathe.
Are you wondering how to recognize a reflexive verb? It’s 
really quite easy. If an -ar, -er, or -ir infinitive (which is con-
jugated in its usual manner) has -se attached to its end, you 
know you have a reflexive verb (lavarse [to wash oneself], 
bañarse [to bathe oneself]). That -se ending shows that the 
reflexive verb has a reflexive pronoun as its direct or indirect 
object (see Chapter 2). The subject of a reflexive verb, like 
subjects with other verbs, may be omitted. Whether you use 
or imply the subject, however, the subject and its reflexive 
pronoun must refer to the same person or thing:
(Yo) Me llamo Gloria. (My name is Gloria. [Literally: I call 
myself Gloria.])
(Nosotros) Nos levantamos. (We get up.)
Reflexive pronouns are exactly the same as direct and indi-
rect object pronouns except for the third-person singular and 
plural (se) forms. Because you use se when double object 
pronouns appear in a sentence (as we cover in Chapter 2), 
remembering to use it as the reflexive pronoun should be rela-
tively easy. Table 3-7 shows reflexive verbs and the reflexive 
pronoun for each subject.

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 61
Table 3-7 
Properly Using Reflexive Pronouns

Some verbs may throw you off a bit. Depending on what 
you want to say, a verb may have both a reflexive and a non-
reflexive form. How’s that possible? Well, a reflexive verb 
requires that the subject act upon itself. What if, however, 
that subject acts upon someone or something else? In that 
case, the sentence doesn’t need a reflexive pronoun.
Look carefully at the examples that follow:
Ella se lava. (She washes herself.)
Ella lava a su perro. (She washes her dog.)
Conversely, some verbs that generally aren’t used reflexively 
can be made reflexive (if the subject is acting upon itself) by 
adding a reflexive pronoun:
Él prepara la comida. (He prepares the meal.)
Él se prepara. (He prepares himself.)
The following table presents many common reflexive verbs 
(letters in parentheses indicate a spelling change).

angry

(e to i)

volverse 
(o to ue)

To negate a reflexive verb, you put no or the proper negative 
word (see Chapter 2) before the reflexive pronoun:
¿Se enoja Ud. a menudo? (Do you often get angry?)
No, no me enojo a menudo. (No, I don’t get angry often.)
No me enojo nunca. (I never get angry.)

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 63
Just like with direct and indirect object pronouns (refer to 
Chapter 2), you generally place reflexive pronouns before the 
conjugated verbs:
Ella no se siente bien. (She doesn’t feel well.)
In sentences with two verbs that follow one subject (as in the 
first two examples that follow) or in sentences with a present 
participle (see the second two examples here and the fol-
lowing section), you have the choice of placing the reflexive 
pronoun before the conjugated verb or after and attached to 
the infinitive or the present participle. When you attach the 
pronoun to a present participle, an accent is required on the 
stressed vowel.
(No) Voy a maquillarme. (I’m [not] going to put on my 
make-up.)
(No) Me voy a maquillar. (I’m [not] going to put on my 
make-up.)
(No) Estoy maquillándome. (I am [not] putting on my 
make-up.)
(No) Me estoy maquillando. (I am [not] putting on my 
make-up )
Making Progress with the 
Present Progressive
You can use the simple present tense to describe a current 
action or an action that you perform on a regular basis. But 
you can also express the same present action as something 
that’s taking place right now by using the present progressive. 
To form the present progressive, you need a form of estar 
(to be) and a present participle. We explain both parts of this 
equation in the following sections.
Understanding present participles
Present participles are verb forms that end in -ing. A Spanish 
present participle has two English equivalents:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
64
 
✓ It may represent the English for “while” or “by” + a pres-
ent participle (an English verb form ending in -ing):
 
 Estudiando, él salió bien en su examen. (By studying, he 
passed his test.)
 
✓ It may represent an English present participle used as an 
adjective that ends in -ing:
 
 Esa niña, quien está tocando el piano, es mi hermana. 
(That girl playing the piano is my sister.)
 
A Spanish present participle, unlike an English gerund (-ing 
verb acting as a noun), may not be used as a noun subject. 
Spanish uses the infinitive form instead. In the example that 
follows, the English verb “swimming” is the noun subject of 
the verb “is.” Note the Spanish use of the infinitive, nadar:
Nadar es mi pasatiempo favorito. (Swimming is my favor-
ite pastime.)
Forming the present participles of regular verbs
Forming participles of regular verbs is quite easy, because 
participles have only one form. Here’s all you have to do:
 
✓ Drop the -ar from -ar verb infinitives and add -ando (the 
equivalent of the English -ing).
 
✓ Drop the -er or -ir from -er or -ir verb infinitives, respec-
tively, and add -iendo (the equivalent of the English -ing).
The following table shows these changes for some example 
verbs:
Ending
Verb
Meaning
Pres. Participle
Meaning
-ar
hablar
to speak
hablando
speaking
-er
aprender
to learn
aprendiendo
learning
-ir
escribir
to write
escribiendo
writing
 
Be careful! If an -er or -ir verb stem ends in a vowel, you must 
drop the ending and add -yendo (the Spanish equivalent of 
-ing) to form the present participle:
caer (to fall): cayendo
construir (to build): construyendo

 Chapter 3: It’s Happening in the Present 65
creer (to believe): creyendo
leer (to read): leyendo
oír (to hear): oyendo
traer (to bring): trayendo
Forming the present participles of stem-changing 
and irregular verbs
You form the present participle of a stem-changing -ir verb 
by changing the vowel in the stem from -e to -i or from -o 
to -u, dropping the -ir infinitive ending, and adding the proper 
ending for a present participle. (Flip to “Changing verb stems” 
and “Using irregular verbs” earlier in this chapter for more 
on these verb types, and check out the preceding section for 
instructions on forming present participles.)
From e → i:
decir (to say, to tell) → diciendo (saying, telling)
mentir (to lie) → mintiendo (lying)
pedir (to ask) → pidiendo (asking)
repetir (to repeat) → repitiendo (repeating)
sentir (to feel) → sintiendo (feeling)
servir (to serve) → sirviendo (serving)
venir (to come) → viniendo (coming)
From o → u:
dormir (to sleep) → durmiendo (sleeping)
morir (to die) → muriendo (dying)
 
Only three Spanish verbs have irregular present participles. 
You don’t use them very frequently, but you should still be 
aware of their forms. Yes, you have to memorize them in case 
you need to use them; at least you only have to worry about 
three! Here they are:
 
✓ ir (to go): yendo
 
✓ poder (to be able): pudiendo
 
✓ reír (to laugh): riendo

Using estar to form the 
present progressive
Estar (to be) is the verb you most often use to form the pres-
ent progressive because the present tense of estar expresses 
that something is taking place. The following table presents 
the present tense conjugation of this irregular verb, which 
you must commit to memory:
estar (to be)
yo estoy
nosotros estamos
tú estás
vosotros estáis
él, ella, Ud. está
ellos, ellas, Uds. están
You form the present progressive by taking the present tense 
of the verb estar and the present participle of the action verb 
(see the preceding section). When you put these two together, 
you have to be + doing the action. Here are some examples:
El niño está durmiendo. (The child is sleeping.)
Estamos escuchando. (We are listening.)

Spicing Up Your 
Descriptions with 
Adjectives, Adverbs, 
and Prepositions
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding adjectives
▶ Using adverbs
▶ Comparing things
▶ Joining with prepositions
T
his chapter illustrates how adjectives in Spanish are dif-
ferent from adjectives in English and presents all that 
you need to know to use them properly. You also discover 
how to form and place adverbs within Spanish sentences. We 
also include an explanation on how to compare and contrast 
people, places, things, ideas, and activities. Finally, we intro-
duce you to common Spanish prepositions and explain how 
to select the most appropriate preposition for your sentences, 
and how to use special pronouns that follow prepositions.
Adding Color with Adjectives
The function of an adjective is to describe a noun or pronoun 
so that your audience gains a better understanding of what 
that noun or pronoun is like. Is the house big? Are the trees

green? You should use adjectives frequently so that people 
will have the most information about, and the best possible 
understanding of, what you want to describe. The following 
sections show you how to use adjectives by discussing their 
agreement and positioning in sentences.
Making adjectives agree
Unlike in English, where adjectives have only one form, 
Spanish adjectives agree in gender (masculine or feminine) 
and number (singular or plural) with the nouns they describe. 
When the noun or pronoun is changed from masculine to fem-
inine, the adjective describing it must also be changed from 
masculine to feminine. When the noun or pronoun is changed 
from singular to plural, its verb and any adjectives describing 
it must also be changed from singular to plural.
The gender of adjectives
Spanish adjectives that end in -o, like most nouns, are mas-
culine. (In some instances, however, masculine adjectives 
end in another vowel and maybe even in a consonant; see 
the following section.) As you may expect, a masculine, sin-
gular adjective ending in -o forms its feminine counterpart by 
changing -o to -a.
The following table lists many common adjectives that you 
may find especially useful in Spanish.

Francisca is shy, too.)
Exceptions to the rules
Every rule has some exceptions. In Spanish, masculine, sin-
gular adjectives may end in -a, -e, or a consonant (other than 
-or). The adjectives in Table 4-1 don’t change in their feminine 
form.

Here’s an example of one of these adjectives at work:
Mi padre es joven, y mi madre es joven también. (My 
father is young, and my mother is young, too.)
 
In Spanish, some adjectives of nationality with a masculine 
form that ends in a consonant add -a to form the feminine. 
The adjectives inglés (and other adjectives of nationality that 
end in -és) and alemán also drop the accent on their final 
vowel to maintain their original stresses:
Masculine
Feminine
Meaning
español

And some adjectives with a masculine form ending in -or add 
-a to form the feminine:
Masculine

hablador

talkative
trabjador
trabajadora
hard-working
Here are some examples:
Fritz es alemán, y Heidi es alemana también. (Fritz is 
German, and Heidi is German, too.)
Carlota es trabajadora, pero su hermano no es traba-
jador. (Carlota is hard-working, but her brother isn’t 
hard-working.)
The plural of adjectives
You have to follow two basic rules to form the plural of adjec-
tives in Spanish. First, you add -s to singular adjectives ending 
in a vowel:
Singular
Plural
Meaning
alto
altos
tall
rubia
rubias
blond
interesante
interesantes
interesting
Second, you add -es to singular adjectives ending in a 
consonant:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
72
Singular
Plural
Meaning
fácil
fáciles
easy
trabajador
trabajadores
hard-working
 
Just like with some nouns and pronouns, make sure to use the 
masculine form of the adjective when speaking about mixed 
company (males and females, with no mind to number):
Mi hermana y mis hermanos son rubios. (My sister and 
my brothers are blond.)
 
Some singular Spanish adjectives don’t follow the basic rules for 
making plurals. They follow the same or similar rules for plural 
formation as Spanish nouns (which we cover in Chapter 2):
 
✓ Singular adjectives ending in -z change -z to -c in the plural:
 
• feliz → felices (happy)
 
✓ Some adjectives add or drop an accent mark to maintain 
original stress:
 
• joven → jóvenes (young)
 
• inglés → ingleses (English)
 
• alemán → alemanes (German)
Positioning adjectives
In Spanish, adjectives may precede or follow the noun they 
modify. Most adjectives follow the noun. The placement 
depends on the type of adjective being used, the connotation 
the speaker wants to convey, and the emphasis being used. 
And sometimes, when more than one adjective describes a 
noun, the rules for placement vary according to the type of 
adjectives being used. For example, possessive adjectives, 
demonstrative adjectives, and adjectives of quantity precede 
the noun they modify, whereas descriptive adjectives gener-
ally follow the noun they modify. The following sections dig 
deeper into these topics.
Adjectives that follow the noun
In Spanish, most descriptive adjectives follow the noun they 
modify. The descriptive adjectives blanca, feos, and intere-
santes follow the noun:

 Chapter 4: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Prepositions 73
una casa blanca (a white house)
dos gatos feos (two ugly cats)
algunas cosas interesantes (some interesting things)
Adjectives that precede the noun
Adjectives that impose limits — numbers, possessive adjec-
tives, demonstrative adjectives, and adjectives of quantity — 
usually precede the noun they modify. The possessive adjec-
tive su and the number una precede the noun, for instance:
su novia francesa (his French girlfriend)
una compañía próspera (a successful company)
 
Descriptive adjectives that emphasize qualities or inherent 
characteristics appear before the noun:
Tenemos buenos recuerdos de su fiesta. (We have good 
memories of her party.)
In this example, the speaker is emphasizing the quality of the 
memories.
Shortening certain adjectives
Some Spanish adjectives get shortened in certain situations. 
The following list details when this occurs:
 
✓ The following adjectives drop their final -o before a mas-
culine, singular noun. Alguno and ninguno add an accent 
to the -u when the -o is dropped:
 
• uno (one) → un coche (one car)
 
• bueno (good) → un buen viaje (a good trip)
 
• malo (bad) → un mal muchacho (a bad boy)
 
• primero (first) → el primer acto (the first act)
 
• tercero (third) → el tercer presidente (the third 
president)
 
• alguno (some) → algún día (some day)
 
• ninguno (no) → ningún hombre (no man)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
74
 
 When a preposition separates the adjective from its 
noun, you use the original form of the adjective (don’t 
drop the -o):
 
• uno de tus primos (one of your cousins)
 
✓ Grande becomes gran (great, important, famous) before a 
singular masculine or feminine noun:
 
• un gran profesor (a great teacher [male])
 
• una gran profesora (a great teacher [female])
 
 But it remains grande after the noun:
 
• un escritorio grande (a large desk)
 
• una mesa grande (a large table)
 
✓ Ciento (one hundred) becomes cien before nouns and 
before the numbers mil and millones:
 
• cien hombres y cien mujeres (one hundred men 
and one hundred women)
 
• cien mil habitantes (one hundred thousand 
inhabitants)
 
• cien millones de euros (one hundred million euros)
Describing Actions with Adverbs
The function of an adverb is to describe a verb, another 
adverb, or an adjective. Does a person run (very) quickly? Is 
her house very big? You use adverbs to express the manner in 
which things are done.
Forming adverbs
Many English adverbs end in -ly, and the equivalent Spanish 
ending is -mente. To form an adverb in Spanish, you add 
-mente to the feminine singular form of an adjective. Table 4-3 
illustrates how it’s done.
 
Unlike adjectives, which require agreement in gender and 
number with the noun they describe, adverbs require no 
agreement because they modify a verb and not a noun or 
pronoun.

The following example shows an adverb in action:
Él entra rápidamente, y ella sale rápidamente. (He 
enters quickly, and she leaves quickly.)
Adverbial phrases
Sometimes, forming an adverb in Spanish by using the femi-
nine singular form of the adjective is quite awkward. You can 
use the preposition con (with) + the noun to form an adver-
bial phrase, which functions in the same way as an adverb. 
Here are some examples of how this works:
con + noun
Adverb
Meaning
con habilidad
hábilmente
skillfully
con paciencia
pacientemente

con rapidez
rápidamente
quickly
con respeto
respetuosamente
respectfully
Here’s an example of this construction:
Ella habla con respeto (respetuosamente). (She speaks 
with respect [respectfully].)
Simple adverbs
Some adverbs and adverbial expressions aren’t formed from 
adjectives; they’re words or phrases in and of themselves. 
Table 4-4 lists some of the most frequently used expressions 
that fit this description.

Here’s an example of one of these phrases in use:
Él habla español bastante bien. (He speaks Spanish rather 
well.)
Positioning of adverbs
You generally place adverbs directly after the verb they 
modify. Sometimes, however, the position of the adverb is 
variable and goes where you’d logically put an English adverb:

 Chapter 4: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Prepositions 77
¿Hablas español elocuentemente? (Do you speak Spanish 
eloquently?)
Afortunadamente, yo recibí el paquete. (Fortunately, I 
received the package.)
Making Comparisons
You generally make comparisons by using adjectives or 
adverbs. You can make comparisons of equality or inequality, 
and you can use superlatives.
Expressing equality
Comparisons of equality show that two things or people are 
the same. In Spanish, whether you’re using an adjective or an 
adverb, you make the comparison the same way. You use tan 
(as) + adjective or adverb + como (as), as shown here:
Dolores es tan conscienzuda como Jorge. (Dolores is as 
conscientious as Jorge.)
Ella estudia tan diligentemente como él. (She studies as 
diligently as he does.)
 
You can make negative comparisons by putting no before the 
verb:
Tú no escuchas tan atentamente como Juan. (You don’t 
listen as attentively as Juan.)
Comparisons of inequality
Comparisons of inequality show that two things or people 
are not the same. As with comparisons of equality, whether 
you’re using an adjective or an adverb, you make the compari-
son the same way. You create the comparison of inequality 
with más (more) or menos (less):
más (menos) + adjective or adverb + que (than)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
78
Here are two examples:
Diego es más (menos) hablador que yo. (Diego is more 
[less] talkative than I.)
Diego habla más (menos) que yo. (Diego talks more [less] 
than I.)
Best of all: The superlative
The superlative shows that something (or someone) is the 
best or worst of its, his, or her kind. You form the superlatives 
of adjectives as follows:
Subject + verb + el (la, los, las) + más (menos) (more 
[less]) + adjective + de (in)
Here’s an example:
Ella es la más alta de su clase. (She is the tallest in her 
class.)
 
If the sentence contains a direct object, you form the superla-
tive by inserting the noun after el (la, los, las):
Ella prepara la paella más deliciosa del mundo. (She pre-
pares the best paella in the world.)
Now for the adverbs. Superlatives of adverbs aren’t distin-
guished from their comparative forms (see the preceding 
comparison sections):
Él acepta críticas más (menos) pacientemente que los 
otros. (He accepts criticism more [less] patiently than 
others.)
Irregular comparatives
As adjectives, bueno (good), malo (bad), grande (big), and 
pequeño (small) have irregular forms in the comparative 
and superlative. Note that grande and pequeño each have 
two different meanings in their comparative and superlative 
forms. Table 4-5 displays all the changes that these adjectives 
undergo.

 Chapter 4: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Prepositions 79

el (la) menor (the least, 
the youngest)
el (la) más pequeño 
(pequeña) (the smallest)
los (las) más (menos) 
pequeños (pequeñas) (the 
smallest [least small])
 
The adverbs bien (well) and mal (poorly) become mejor 
(better) and peor (worse), respectively, in their comparative 
forms and follow the verb or verb phrase they modify:
Tomás juega al fútbol mejor que Javier. (Tómas plays 
soccer better than Javier.)
Ella cocina peor que yo. (She cooks worse than I do.)
The absolute superlative
The absolute superlative expresses the ultimate; you use it 
when no comparison is made. To form this basic construc-
tion, you add -ísimo (masc.); -ísima (fem.); -ísimos (masc. 
plural); or -ísimas (fem. plural) to the adjective according to 
the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
80
plural) of the noun being described. The meaning is the same 
as muy (very) + adjective:
La catedral es muy bella. La catedral es bellísima. (The 
cathedral is very beautiful.)
Los edificios son muy altos. Los edifícios son altísimos. 
(The buildings are very tall.)
Here are some more things you need to know to form the 
absolute superlative:
 
✓ You drop the final vowel of an adjective before adding 
-ísimo (-a, -os, -as):
 
• La casa es grande. La casa es grandísima. (The 
house is very large.)
 
✓ You use muchísimo to express very much:
 
• Te adoro muchísimo. (I adore you very much.)
 
✓ Adjectives ending in -co (-ca), -go (-ga), or -z change c to 
qu, g to gu, and z to c, respectively, before adding -ísimo:
 
• La torta es muy rica. La torta es riquísima. (The 
pie is very tasty.)
 
• El suéter es muy largo. El suéter es larguísimo. 
(The sweater is very long.)
 
• El juez es muy sagaz. El juez es sagacísimo. (The 
judge is very shrewd.)
Linking with Prepositions
Think of prepositions as words that join different words, 
clauses, or phrases. Prepositions relate elements in a sen-
tence: noun to noun, verb to verb, or verb to noun/pronoun. 
Prepositions also may contract with articles: a + el = al and de 
+ el = del (as we discuss in Chapter 2).
We list the most useful Spanish prepositions in Table 4-6.

As you can see in the table, some Spanish prepositions have 
multiple meanings. The following section explains when to 
use which word, and then we explain which prepositions and 
verbs go together.
Selecting the correct preposition
Sometimes, selecting the correct preposition to use in a sen-
tence can be tricky because some prepositions have more 
than one meaning. Take a, for example, which can mean to or 
at; en, which can mean at or in; and por and para, which can 
both mean for. Fortunately, Spanish has some rules that can 
help you understand when the more common prepositions 
are appropriate.
A
You use a, which means to or at, to show

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
82
 
✓ Time: Te llamo a las tres. (I’ll call you at 3 o’clock.)
 
✓ Movement: Vamos a la playa. (We’re going to the beach.)
 
✓ Location: Espere a la entrada. (Wait at the entrance.)
 
✓ Means/manner: Hágalo a mano. (Do it by hand.)
 
✓ Price: Puede comprarlo a cien pesos. (You can buy it 
for 100 pesos.)
 
You use the preposition a (which contracts with the definite 
article el to become al) before a direct object alluding to a 
person; this usage is the personal a we discuss in Chapter 2:
Buscamos al señor Nuñez. (We are looking for Mr. Nuñez.)
De
Another preposition with several meanings is de (which con-
tracts with the definite article el to become del). You use de, 
which means of, from, or about, to show
 
✓ Possession: Es el coche de Julio. (It’s Julio’s car.)
 
✓ Origin: Soy de Panamá. (I’m from Panama.)
 
✓ Material: Es un anillo de oro. (It’s a gold ring.)
 
✓ Relationship: Madrid es la capital de España. (Madrid is 
the capital of Spain.)
 
✓ Part of a whole: Toma un trozo de pan. (She’s taking a 
piece of bread.)
 
✓ A subject: No encuentro mi libro de arte. (I can’t find my 
art book.)
 
✓ A superlative: Es el más alto de todos. (He’s the tallest of 
them all.)
En
The preposition en can mean in, by, or on. You use en to show
 
✓ Time: Estamos en el otoño. (It’s [We’re in] the fall.)
 
✓ Location: Está en esta calle. (It’s on that street.)
 
✓ Means/manner: Está escrita en español. (It’s written in 
Spanish.)

 Chapter 4: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Prepositions 83
 
✓ Movement: Entran en el banco. (They enter the bank.)
 
✓ Means of transport: Viajan en avión. (They are traveling 
by plane.)
Hasta
The preposition hasta, which means until (but which also can 
have the meaning to), shows the following:
 
✓ Place/location: Conduzca hasta el semáforo. (Drive to 
the traffic light.)
 
✓ Time: Hasta luego. (See you later. [Until then.])
Para versus por
Now you come to two prepositions that can cause much con-
fusion among students of Spanish. Por and para both mean 
for in English.
The preposition para shows the following:
 
✓ Destination/place: Salimos para Madrid. (We are leaving 
for Madrid.)
 
✓ Destination/person: Esto es para Ud. (This is for you.)
 
✓ A future time limit: Es para mañana. (It’s for tomorrow.)
 
✓ Purpose/goal: Nado para divertirme. (I swim to have 
fun.)
 
✓ Use/function: Es un cepillo para el pelo. (It’s a hair 
brush.)
 
✓ Comparisons: Para su edad, lee bien. (For her age, she 
reads well.)
 
✓ Opinion: Para mí está demasiado crudo. (For me it’s too 
rare.)
The preposition por shows the following:
 
✓ Motion/place: Caminan por las calles. (They walk 
through the streets.)
 
✓ Means/manner: Lo envío por correo. (I’m sending it by 
mail.)
 
✓ In exchange for/substitution: Voy a hacerlo por tí. (I’m 
going to do it for you.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
84
 
✓ Duration of an action: Trabajo por una hora. (I’m work-
ing for an hour.)
 
✓ Indefinite time period: Duerme por la tarde. (He sleeps in 
the afternoon.)
 
✓ On behalf of: La firmo por Ud. (I am signing it on your 
behalf.)
 
✓ Per: Me pagan por día. (They pay me per day.)
 
You use por to express for after the verbs enviar (to send), ir 
(to go), mandar (to order, send), preguntar (to ask), regresar 
(to return), venir (to come), and volver (to return). Here is an 
example:
Ven (Regresa, Vuelve) por tu libro. (Come [Return, Come 
back] for your book.)
 
If you’re speaking about a means of transportation for a pas-
senger, use en rather than por to express by:
Van a la capital en tren. (They are going to the capital by 
train.)
Using prepositions with verbs
The only verb form in the Spanish language that may follow 
a preposition is an infinitive. Some Spanish verbs require 
the preposition a, de, en, or con before the infinitive. Other 
Spanish verbs that are followed immediately by the infini-
tive don’t require a preposition. The following sections break 
down all the categories for you.
Spanish verbs requiring a
Generally, verbs that express beginning, motion, teaching, or 
learning take a. However, many other verbs use this preposi-
tion before an infinitive. Table 4-7 shows which Spanish verbs 
call for the use of a before the infinitive.

shorter than the list for those verbs requiring a. Table 4-8 lists 
the Spanish verbs that are followed by de before an infinitive.

Spanish verbs requiring en
The list of verbs that require en before an infinitive is even 
shorter than the others, thankfully! Table 4-9 lists these 
Spanish verbs:
Table 4-9 
Spanish Verbs Requiring en
Infinitive
Meaning
consentir (ie)
to agree to
consistir 
to consist of
convenir (ie)
to agree to
insistir 
to insist on
tardar

This example illustrates how you use en before an infinitive:
¿Por qué insistes en partir ahora? (Why do you insist on 
leaving now?)
Spanish verbs requiring con
Table 4-10 shows the short list of Spanish verbs that use con 
before an infinitive:

Using the right pronoun 
after a preposition
You must use certain special Spanish pronouns after preposi-
tions. The prepositional pronoun acts as the object of a prepo-
sition and always follows the preposition. Table 4-12 presents 
these prepositional pronouns:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
88
Table 4-12 
Prepositional Pronouns
Singular
Plural
mí (me)
nosotros (nosotras) (us; polite)
ti (you; familiar)
vosotros (vosotras) (you; familiar)
él (him, it)
ellos (them; masculine)
ella (her, it)
ellas (them; feminine)
Ud. (you; polite)
Uds. (you; polite)
Here are some examples to show you how you use these 
pronouns:
Esta carta es para mí, no es para ella. (This letter is for 
me, not for her.)
Juego al tenis con él, no con ella. (I play tennis with him, 
not with her.)
 
The prepositional pronouns mí and ti combine with the prep-
osition con as follows:
 
✓ conmigo: with me
 
✓ contigo: with you
Here are examples that show how you use these words:
¿Puedes ir al cine conmigo? (Can you go to the movies 
with me?)
No puedo ir contigo. (I can’t go with you.)

Chapter 5
Making Inquiries
In This Chapter
▶ Getting and receiving a “yes” or a “no”
▶ Asking for and giving information
S
ometimes when you ask a question, all you want in return 
is a simple “yes” or “no” answer — no explanations are 
necessary. Other times, however, you’re really interested 
in getting information and want all the facts, so you need to 
know how to properly ask questions in Spanish in order to 
receive the correct answers. And, of course, many people 
have questions for you that you need to provide Spanish 
answers for.
In this chapter, you find out how to obtain all the informa-
tion you need — from easy “yes” or “no” questions to more 
detailed inquiries about “who?”, “what?”, “when?”, “where?”, 
“how?”, or “why?”. With the help of this chapter, you can 
become proficient at not only asking questions but also giving 
appropriate answers to the questions others ask you.
Posing a Yes/No Question
Forming a Spanish question that requires a “yes” or “no” 
answer is very easy. You use three simple methods:
 
✓ Intonation
 
✓ The tag ¿(No es) verdad? (Isn’t that so?) or ¿Está bien? 
(Is that all right?)
 
✓ Inversion

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
90
The following sections break down these methods.
 
Unlike in English, when you want to write a question in 
Spanish, you put an upside-down question mark — ¿ — at the 
beginning of the sentence and a standard question mark — 
? — at the end:
¿Tiene Ud. sed? (Are you thirsty?)
Also, the words do and does and sometimes am, is, and are 
don’t translate from English into Spanish. In Spanish, these 
words are part of the meaning of the conjugated verb:
¿Vienen hoy? (Are they coming today?)
 
To form a negative question, you simply put no before the 
conjugated Spanish verb:
¿No quieres tomar algo? (Don’t you want to drink 
something?)
Intonation
Intonation is by far the easiest way to ask a question in 
Spanish. If you’re speaking, all you need to do is raise your 
voice at the end of what was a statement and add an imagi-
nary question mark at the end of your thought. When writing, 
you just write down your thought and put question marks 
before and after it. It’s that simple. Here’s an example:
¿Ud. quiere tomar algo? (Do you want to drink 
something?)
The tags “¿No es verdad?” 
and “¿Está bien?”
¿No es verdad? and ¿Está bien? are tags that can have a vari-
ety of meanings:
 
✓ Isn’t that so?
 
✓ Right?
 
✓ Isn’t (doesn’t) he/she?

 Chapter 5: Making Inquiries 91
 
✓ Aren’t (don’t) they?
 
✓ Aren’t (don’t) we?
 
✓ Aren’t (don’t) you?
 
You generally place ¿No es verdad? or ¿Está bien? at the 
end of a statement — especially when “yes” is the expected 
answer:
Ud. quiere tomar algo. ¿No es verdad? (You want to drink 
something, don’t you?)
Tenemos jugo. ¿Está bien? (We have juice. Is that all right?)
Inversion
Inversion means that you turn something around; you can 
invert anything from a picture to words in a sentence. When 
forming a “yes” or “no” question in Spanish, you may invert 
the word order of the pronoun or the subject noun and its 
accompanying verb form. The following list details some dif-
ferent considerations when using inversion:
 
✓ With inversion, pronouns tied to the conjugated verb 
should remain after it:
 
• ¿Tiene Ud. sed ? (Are you thirsty?)
 
• ¿Va ella a tomar té? (Is she going to drink tea?)
 
✓ If the subject noun or pronoun is followed by two con-
secutive verbs, put the subject noun or pronoun after the 
phrase containing the second verb (remember to keep 
the meaning of the phrase intact):
 
• ¿Quieren comer Uds.? (Do you want to eat?)
 
• ¿Prefiere tomar carne Luz? (Does Luz prefer to eat 
meat?)
 
 In most instances, you omit the subject pronoun in 
Spanish when the subject is obvious:
 
• ¿Quieres comer algo ahora? (Do you want to eat 
something now?)
 
✓ To ask a negative inverted question, put no before the 
inverted verb and noun or pronoun. For verbs preceded 
by a direct or indirect object pronoun (see Chapter 2) or 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
92
for reflexive verbs (see Chapter 3), the pronoun should 
remain before the conjugated verb:
 
• ¿No toma frutas tu amigo? (Doesn’t your friend eat 
fruit?)
 
• ¿No las toma tu amigo? (Doesn’t your friend eat them?)
 
• ¿No se desayuna temprano Alberto? (Doesn’t 
Alberto eat breakfast early?)
Responding to a Yes/No Question
You undoubtedly know how to answer “yes” in Spanish 
because the word for “yes” is common in pop culture. 
Answering “no” requires a bit more work, because a simple 
“no” doesn’t always suffice. Sometimes you need to express 
nothing, nobody, or other negative ideas. The following sec-
tions cover these topics in detail.
Being positive
Saying “yes”  in Spanish is really quite easy. You use sí to 
answer “yes” to a question:
¿Quieres salir conmigo? (Do you want to go out with me?)
Sí, con mucho gusto. (Yes, I’d be delighted.)
Being negative
The most common negative response to a question is a plain 
and simple no (no, not). Other common negatives, which 
you may or may not use in conjunction with no, include the 
following:
Spanish
Negative English Equivalent
ni . . . ni
neither . . . nor
tampoco
neither, not either
jamás, nunca
never, (not) ever
nadie
no one, nobody
ninguno(a)
no, none, (not) any
nada
nothing

 Chapter 5: Making Inquiries 93
Here’s a list that details some general considerations to 
ponder when answering negatively in Spanish:
 
✓ In Spanish, you generally place negative words before the 
conjugated verb:
 
 Nunca comprendo lo que Miguel dice. (I never under-
stand what Miguel says.)
 
 Unlike in English, double negatives are perfectly accept-
able and sometimes even necessary in common usage for 
a Spanish sentence. Some sentences may even contain 
three negatives! For example, No le creo ni a él ni a ella./
Ni a él ni a ella les creo. (I believe neither him nor her.) 
If no is one of the negatives, it precedes the conjugated 
verb. When no is omitted, the other negative precedes 
the conjugated verb. Here are some examples of both:
 
• No fumo nunca./Nunca fumo. (I never smoke.)
 
• No viene nadie./Nadie viene. (No one is coming.)
 
• No le escucha a nadie nunca./Nunca le escucha a 
nadie. (He never listens to anyone.)
 
✓ When you have two verbs in the negative answer, place 
no before the conjugated verb and put the other negative 
word after the second verb:
 
• No puedo comer ninguna comida picante. (I can’t 
eat any spicy food.)
 
✓ You may also place negative words before the infinitive 
of the verb:
 
• Él prefiere no ver a nadie. (He doesn’t want to see 
anyone.)
 
✓ You may use negatives alone (without no):
 
• ¿Qué buscas? (What do you want?)
 
 Nada. (Nothing.)
 
✓ A negative preceded by a preposition (see Chapter 2) 
retains that preposition when placed before the verb:
 
• No habla de nadie./De nadie habla. (He doesn’t 
speak about anyone.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
94
Using no
To make a sentence negative, you can put no before the con-
jugated verb. If the conjugated verb is preceded by a pronoun, 
put no before the pronoun. You often repeat no for emphasis:
¿Debe estudiar los verbos ella? (Does she have to study 
the verbs?)
(No,) Ella no los debe estudiar. ([No,] She doesn’t have to 
study them.)
Using ni . . . ni
In a ni . . . ni (neither . . . nor) construction, the sentence usu-
ally begins with the word no. Each part of the ni . . . ni con-
struction precedes the word or words being stressed. Each 
ni, therefore, may be used before a noun, an adjective, or an 
infinitive:
No nos gusta ni el café ni el té. (We don’t like coffee or 
tea.)
Su coche no es ni grande ni pequeño. (His car is neither 
big nor little.)
No puedo ni cocinar ni coser. (I can neither cook nor sew.)
Using nadie, nada, nunca, and jamás
You use the negatives nadie, nada, nunca, and jamás after 
comparisons (see Chapter 4). Note that the English transla-
tion of a Spanish negative may have an opposite meaning:
Mi madre cocina mejor que nadie. (My mother cooks 
better than anyone.)
Ella conduce más que nunca. (She drives better than 
ever.)
Quieren visitar España más que nada. (They want to visit 
Spain more than anything.)
Using ninguno
Ninguno (no, none [not] any), when used before a masculine 
singular noun, drops the final -o and adds an accent to the u 

 Chapter 5: Making Inquiries 95
(ningún). The feminine singular form is ninguna. No plural 
forms exist. Here’s an example of its usage:
¿Tiene algunos problemas? (Do you have any problems?)
No tengo problema ninguno. (I don’t have a problem.)
No tengo ningún problema. (I don’t have a problem.)
 
When used as an adjective, ninguno/a may be replaced by 
alguno/a, which is a more emphatic negative. This construc-
tion then follows the noun:
No tiene ninguna mascota./No tiene mascota alguna. (He 
doesn’t have a pet.)
Question words requiring their opposite 
in the negative answers
When used in questions, some words require that you use 
negative words of opposite meaning in the responses. The 
following table presents these words:
If the question contains
The negative answer should 
contain
alguien (someone, anyone)
nadie (no one, nobody)
siempre (always)
jamás/nunca (never)
algo (something)
nada (nothing)
también (also)
tampoco (neither, either)
alguno(a) (some, any)
ninguno(a) (none, [not] any)
Here’s an example sentence:
¿Ves algo? (Do you see something?)
No veo nada. (I don’t see anything.)
Obtaining the Facts
When a simple “yes” or “no” won’t satisfy your curiosity, you 
need to know how to ask for more information in Spanish. 
Interrogative adjectives, interrogative adverbs, and interroga-
tive pronouns are the tools that allow you to get all the facts 
you want and need. Find out how in the following sections.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
96
Using interrogative adjectives
You use the interrogative adjective ¿cuánto? (How much?/
How many?) before a noun when that noun may be counted 
or measured. ¿Cuánto? varies and must agree in number and 
gender with the noun it describes:
Masculine
Feminine
Singular
¿cuánto?
¿cuánta?
Plural
¿cuántos?
¿cuántas?
Here are some examples of ¿cuánto? in use:
¿Cuánto dinero necesitas? (How much money do you 
need?)
¿Cuántos dólares ganan por hora? (How many dollars do 
they earn per hour?)
¿Cuánta sal echa Ud.? (How much salt are you adding?)
¿Cuántas horas trabajan? (How many hours do they 
work?)
 
Cuánto, cuánta, cuántos, and cuántas may also be used as 
interrogative pronouns. Check out “Employing Interrogative 
Pronouns” later in the chapter for more info.
The interrogative adjective ¿qué?, on the other hand, is 
invariable (it doesn’t change) and refers to a noun that isn’t 
being counted. This word is equivalent to the English inter-
rogative adjectives what or which:
¿Qué idiomas sabes hablar? (What [Which] languages do 
you know how to speak?)
 
You may use a preposition before an interrogative adjective 
where logical:
¿A qué hora sale el tren? (At what time does the train 
leave?)
¿Con cuánta frecuencia vas al cine? ([With how much fre-
quency] How often do you go to the movies?)

 Chapter 5: Making Inquiries 97
Getting information with 
interrogative adverbs
You use interrogative adverbs when you need an adverb to 
ask a question. You often use the interrogative adverbs that 
follow when using inversion to form questions (see the earlier 
section “Inversion”):
English Adverb
Spanish Interrogative Adverb
How?
¿cómo?
When?
¿cuándo?
Where (to)?
¿dónde?
Why? (for what reason)
¿por qué?
Why? (for what purpose)
¿para qué?
Here are a couple of these adverbs at work:
¿Cómo va Ud. a la oficina? (How do you get to work?)
¿Dónde vive tu hermana? (Where does your sister live?)
 
You may use a preposition before an interrogative adverb 
where logical (note that the preposition a is attached to the 
interrogative adverb in the first example):
¿Adónde quieren ir los niños? (Where do the children 
want to go?)
¿Para qué sirve esta herramienta? (How is this tool 
used?)
 
The interrogative adverb ¿Para qué? asks about a purpose 
and, therefore, requires an answer with para (for, to):
¿Para qué usa Ud. esa brocha? (Why [For what purpose] 
do you use that brush?)
Uso esa brocha para pintar. (I use that brush to paint.)
¿Por qué? asks about a reason and, therefore, requires an 
answer with porque (because):
¿Por qué llora el niño? (Why [For what reason] is the 
child crying?)
Llora porque está triste. (He’s crying because he is sad.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
98
Employing interrogative pronouns
You use an interrogative pronoun when a pronoun is needed 
to ask a question. The following table presents the Spanish 
equivalents to English pronouns:
English Pronoun
Spanish Interrogative Pronoun
Who?
¿quién(es)?
What? (Which one[s]?)
¿cuál(es)?
What?
¿qué?
How much?
¿cuánto?
How many?
¿cuántos(as)?
The following list breaks down the characteristics of the inter-
rogative pronouns in the previous list:
 
✓ The interrogative pronouns ¿quién(es)? and ¿cuál(es)? 
are variable pronouns and change to agree in number 
only with the noun they replace:
 
• ¿Quién(es) llega(n)? (Who is arriving?)
 
 Raquel llega. (Raquel is arriving.)
 
 Raquel y Domingo llegan. (Raquel and Domingo 
are arriving.)
 
• ¿Cuál(es) de esta(s) blusa(s) prefieres? (Which of 
these blouses do you prefer?)
 
 Prefiero la roja. (I prefer the red one.)
 
 Prefiero las rojas. (I prefer the red ones.)
 
✓ ¿Cuál? means what or which (one/s) and asks about a 
choice or a selection:
 
• ¿Cuál es tu número de teléfono? (What is your 
phone number?)
 
• ¿Cuál de los dos es el mejor? (Which [one] of the 
two is better?)
 
• ¿Cuáles son los días de la semana? (What are the 
days of the week?)

 Chapter 5: Making Inquiries 99
 
✓ ¿Cuánto?, when it means how many, agrees in both 
number and gender with the noun being replaced:
 
• ¿Cuántos toman el examen? (How many are taking 
the test?)
 
✓ ¿Cuánto?, when it means how much, and ¿qué? remain 
invariable:
 
• ¿Cuánto vale ese coche? (How much is this car 
worth?)
 
• ¿Qué significa esto? (What does this mean?)
 
✓ A preposition + quién refers to people. A preposition + 
que refers to things:
 
• ¿De quiénes habla Ud.? (About whom are you 
speaking?)
 
• ¿De qué habla Ud.? (About what are you speaking?)
 
• ¿A quién se refiere él? (To whom is he referring?)
 
• ¿A qué se refiere él? (To what is he referring?)
 
✓ ¿Qué? means what when it precedes a verb and asks 
about a definition, description, or an explanation. When 
¿qué? precedes a noun, it expresses which:
 
• ¿Qué hacen durante el verano? (What are they 
doing during the summer?)
 
• ¿Qué película quieres ver? (Which film do you want 
to see?)
 
Hay (there is/are or is/are there?) is a present-tense form of 
the auxiliary verb haber (to have). You use this verb imper-
sonally both to ask and to answer the question you ask. You 
can use hay by itself or with a preceding question word:
¿(No) Hay un buen restaurante por aquí? (Is[n’t] there a 
good restaurant nearby?)
¿Dónde hay un buen restaurante por aquí? (Where is 
there a good restaurant nearby?)
Providing Information
This section is chock full of tips on how to answer questions 
that ask you for information in Spanish.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
100
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Cómo? (how, what), give 
the information or the explanation that’s requested:
 
• ¿Cómo te llamas? (What’s your name?)
 
 Susana. (Susana.)
 
• ¿Cómo prepara Ud. este plato? (How do you pre-
pare that dish?)
 
 Con mantequilla y crema. (With butter and cream.)
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Cuánto(a)(s)? (how much, 
many), you answer with a number, an amount, or a quan-
tity (see Chapter 1):
 
• ¿Cuánto cuesta este coche? (How much does this 
car cost?)
 
 Diez mil dólares. ($10,000.)
 
• ¿Cuántos huevos necesitas? (How many eggs do 
you need?)
 
 Una docena. (A dozen.)
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Cuándo? (when), you 
answer with a specific time or an expression of time:
 
• ¿Cuándo empieza la película? (When does the film 
begin?)
 
 En diez minutos. (In 10 minutes.)
 
 A las tres y media. (At 3:30.)
 
 En seguida. (Immediately.)
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Dónde? (where), you 
answer with the name of a place. You use the preposition 
en to express in:
 
• ¿Dónde vive Ud.? (Where do you live?)
 
 En Nueva York. (In New York.)
 
 You must use the preposition a (al, a los, a las) + the 
name of a place in your answer to the question ¿adónde? 
(¿a dónde?) (which translates literally as to where):
 
• ¿Adónde van? (Where are they going?)
 
 Van al estadio. (They are going to the stadium.)

 Chapter 5: Making Inquiries 101
 
 You must use the preposition de (del, de la, de los) + 
the name of a place in your answer to the question ¿de 
dónde? (which translates literally as from where):
 
• ¿De dónde es Ud.? (Where are you from?)
 
 Soy de San Juan. (I’m from San Juan.)
 
 For more on prepositions, head to Chapter 4.
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Por qué? (why), answer 
with porque (because) + a reason:
 
• ¿Por qué no trabaja ella? (Why isn’t she working?)
 
 Porque está enferma. (Because she’s sick.)
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Quién? (who, whom), 
answer with the name of a person.
 
 If the question contains a preposition — a, de, con, para, 
and so on — you must use that same preposition in the 
answer:
 
• ¿A quién espera Ud.? (Whom are you waiting for?)
 
 A mi novio. (For my boyfriend.)
 
• ¿Con quiénes vives? (With whom do you live?)
 
 Con mis abuelos. (With my grandparents.)
 
✓ When you see a question with ¿Qué? (what), answer 
according to the situation. As with the preceding bullet, 
if the question contains a preposition, you must use that 
same preposition in the answer:
 
• ¿Qué escribes? (What are you writing?)
 
 Una carta. (A letter.)
 
• ¿Con qué escribes? (With what are you writing?)
 
 Con un bolígrafo. (With a ballpoint pen.)

Revealing the Past
In This Chapter
▶ Using the preterit to express completed actions
▶ Discussing habitual actions with the imperfect
▶ Selecting the best way to communicate the past
▶ Revealing the past with the present perfect
W
hat’s past is past. Or is it? The past tense can be a 
little murky in Spanish. Sometimes, an action in the 
past is complete: It’s done, over, kaput. In other cases, past 
action is a little vaguer. It doesn’t relate to a specific event but 
to a past action that was continuous, ongoing, or habitual — 
something you “used to do” or “were doing,” for example, at 
no set period or time. In order to effectively understand and 
use the different past tenses in Spanish, you need to become 
much more aware of their differences, and this chapter helps 
you do just that.
Living in the Past
In Spanish, several different tenses allow you to express past 
actions. One of them is the preterit, which expresses an action, 
event, or state of mind that occurred and was completed at a 
specific time in the past. (For example, “She closed her book” 
or “He caught the ball.”) If you remember that the action 
ended at a definite moment, you’ll have no trouble using the 
preterit.
The imperfect allows you to give descriptions and to speak 
about what you were in the habit of doing in the past: “He 
was swimming (used to, would swim) every day.” To put it in 
a visual sense, if the preterit tense captures a snapshot of a 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
104
past action with the click of the button, the imperfect tense 
captures the motion of a past action with a video camera. If 
you recall that an action extended over an indefinite period of 
time, you’ll have no trouble using the imperfect.
In the following sections, we explain how to form the preterit 
for regular, stem-changing, and irregular verbs and then tell 
you when to use it. (We cover the imperfect tense later in the 
chapter.)
Forming the preterit 
of regular verbs
Forming the preterit of regular verbs is rather easy, because 
although they have three different infinitive endings — -ar, 
-er, and -ir — you use only two different sets of endings for the 
preterit.
To form the preterit of regular verbs, you drop the -ar, -er, or 
-ir infinitive ending and add the preterit endings. The follow-
ing table shows the conjugation of an -ar verb:
mirar (to look at)
yo miré
nosotros miramos
tú miraste
vosotros mirasteis
él, ella, Ud. miró
ellos, ellas, Uds. miraron
Yo miré la televisión. (I watched television.)
Here’s the conjugation of an -er verb:
beber (to drink)
yo bebí
nosotros bebimos
tú bebiste
vosotros bebisteis
él, ella, Ud. bebió
ellos, ellas, Uds. bebieron
Él no bebió nada. (He didn’t drink anything.)

 Chapter 6: Revealing the Past 105
Finally, allow us to give you this -ir conjugation:
recibir (to receive)
yo recibí
nosotros recibimos
tú recibiste
vosotros recibisteis
él, ella, Ud. recibió
ellos, ellas, Uds. recibieron
¿Qué recibiste? (What did you receive?)
 
The nosotros preterit forms of -ar verbs and -ir verbs are the 
same as their present-tense forms:
 
Nosotros hablamos. (We speak; We spoke.)
Forming the preterit of 
spelling change verbs
Only two categories of verbs have spelling changes in the 
preterit tense:
 
✓ Those with -car, -gar, and -zar endings.
 
✓ Those that have a vowel before their -er or -ir ending.
The following sections dive into these changes.
Verbs ending in -car, -gar, and -zar
Verbs ending in -car, -gar, and -zar undergo a change, but only 
in the yo form of the preterit, as follows: 
c changes to qu
tocar (to touch)
yo toqué (I touched)
g changes to gu
jugar (to play)
yo jugué (I played)
z changes to c
empezar (to begin)
yo empecé (I began)
Here are some examples sentences with verbs with these 
endings:
Yo expliqué el problema. (I explained the problem.)
Yo llegué antes de ellos. (I arrived before them.)
Yo almorcé con mis amigos. (I ate lunch with my friends.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
106
Verbs that change i to y
Verbs that contain a vowel immediately preceding their -er or 
-ir ending change i to y in the él, ella, Ud., ellos, ellas, Uds. 
forms. All other forms have an accented i: í.
Spanish verbs that require the i to y change:
Verb
Yo
Tú
Él/
Ella/
Ud.
Nosotros
Vosotros
Ellos/
Ellas/ 
Uds.
caer 
(to fall)
caí
caíste
cayó
caímos
caísteis
cayeron
creer 
(to believe)
creí
creíste
creyó
creímos
creísteis
creyeron
leer 
(to read)
leí
leíste
leyó
leímos
leísteis
leyeron
oír 
(to hear)
oí
oíste
oyó
oímos
oísteis
oyeron
Here are examples using these verbs:
El turista se cayó. (The tourist fell.)
Ellos no me creyeron. (They didn’t believe me.)
¿Leyó Ud. esto? (Did you read this?)
No oyeron nada. (They didn’t hear anything.)
 
The i to y change doesn’t hold true for the verb traer (to 
bring):
Él no trajo su pasaporte. (He didn’t bring his passport.)
 
Verbs ending in -uir (concluir [to conclude], destruir [to 
destroy], sustituir [to substitute], and so on) follow the i to 
y change, but they don’t accent the i in the tú, nosotros, or 
vosotros forms:
concluir (to conclude): concluí, concluiste, concluyó, con-
cluimos, concluisteis, concluyeron
Here’s concluir in a sentence:
Ellos concluyeron sus estudios. (They concluded their 
studies.)

 Chapter 6: Revealing the Past 107
Verbs with stem changes
The only verbs with stem changes in the preterit tense are -ir 
infinitive verbs that have a stem change in the present tense 
(see Chapter 3). Be careful, though! The change is different 
in the preterit tense than it is in the present. Here’s how you 
form the preterit: Change e to i or o to u only in the él, ella, 
Ud., ellos, ellas, Uds. forms. The following table shows what 
these verbs look like in the preterit tense:
Verb
Yo
Tú
Él/
Ella/
Ud.
Nosotros
Vosotros
Ellos/
Ellas/
Uds.
preferir 
(to prefer) 
(e to ie)
preferí preferiste prefi rió preferimos preferisteis prefiri-
eron
pedir 
(to ask) 
(e to i)
pedí
pediste
pidió
pedimos
pedisteis
pidieron
dormir 
(to sleep) 
(o to ue)
dormí
dormiste
durmió dormimos
dormisteis
durmi-
eron
Here are examples using these verbs:
Ella prefirió quedarse en casa ese día. (She preferred to 
stay home that day.)
Nosotros pedimos su ayuda. (We asked for his help.)
¿Dormiste bien? (Did you sleep well?)
 
The verbs reír (to laugh) and sonreír (to smile) change e 
to i in the él, ella, Ud, ellos, ellas, Uds. forms, and you add 
accents to the tú, nosotros, and vosotros forms. Here’s the 
conjugation:
reir (to laugh): reí, reíste, rió, reímos, reísteis, rieron
An example follows:
Ellas rieron se de él. (They laughed at him.)

Forming the preterit 
of irregular verbs
Many verbs that are irregular in the present tense also are 
irregular in the preterit, which makes them easier to rec-
ognize as irregular verbs. Some of these irregular verbs 
may be grouped according to the changes they undergo. 
Unfortunately, a small number of verbs are completely irregu-
lar and must be memorized.
 
Most irregular verbs fall into categories, which makes them 
easier to remember. The irregular verbs in the categories in 
this section have the following endings in the preterit tense:
 
✓ yo: -e
 
✓ tú: -iste
 
✓ él, ella, Ud.: -o
 
✓ nosotros: -imos
 
✓ vosotros: -isteis
 
✓ ellos, ellas, Uds.: ieron (or -jeron if the stem ends in -j)
Verbs with i in the preterit stem
Some Spanish verbs with an e or an a in their stems change 
the e or a to i in the preterit:
Verb
Yo
Tú
Él/
Ella/
Ud.
Nosotros Vosotros
Ellos/
Ellas/
Uds.
decir 
(to say, tell)
dije
dijiste
dijo
dijimos
dijisteis
dijeron
venir 
(to come)
vine
viniste
vino
vinimos
vinisteis
vinieron
querer 
(to wish, want) 
quise
quisiste quiso
quisimos
quisisteis
quisieron
hacer 
(to make, to do)
hice
hiciste
hizo
hicimos
hicisteis
hicieron

 Chapter 6: Revealing the Past 109
 
In the third-person singular preterit of hacer, -c changes to -z 
to maintain the original sound of the verb.
Examples using these verbs follow:
¿Qué dijo Ud.? (What did you say?)
¿A qué hora vinieron? (At what time did they come?)
Yo no quise salir anoche. (I didn’t want to go out last night.)
Los muchachos no hicieron nada. (The boys didn’t do 
anything.)
Verbs with u in the preterit stem
Some irregular Spanish verbs with an a or an o in their stem 
change the a or the o to u:
Verb
Yo
Tú
Él/
Ella/
Ud.
Nosotros
Vosotros
Ellos/
Ellas/
Uds.
caber 
 (to fit)
cupe
cupiste
cupo
cupimos
cupisteis
cupieron
saber 
(to know)
supe
supiste
supo
supimos
supisteis
supieron
poner 
(to put)
puse
pusiste
puso
pusimos
pusisteis
pusieron
poder 
(to be able)
pude
pudiste
pudo
pudimos
pudisteis
pudieron
Here are some example sentences:
Nosotros no cupimos todos en el coche. (We didn’t all fit 
in the car.)
¿Supo Ud. la respuesta? (Did you know the answer?)
Lo puse en la mesa. (I put it on the table.)
No pudieron hacerlo. (They couldn’t do it.)
Verbs with uv in the preterit stem
Three Spanish verbs use uv before their preterit endings. Be 
careful, though, because tener doesn’t follow the same pat-
tern as andar and estar. The preterit endings are added after 
the initial t, and not after the infinitive stem ten:

Here’s how you use these verbs in the preterit:
Nosotros anduvimos al teatro. (We walked to the theater.)
Ayer yo estuve en casa. (Yesterday I was at home.)
Ella tuvo un catarro. (She had a cold.)
Verbs with j in the preterit stem
Some irregular Spanish verbs have a j in their preterit stems. 
This category includes all verbs that end in -ducir as well as 
the verb decir (to say; see the earlier section “Verbs with i in 
the preterit stem”). Note that there’s no i in the él, ella, Ud., 
ellos, ellas, and Uds. endings:
Verb
Yo

Él/
Ella/
Ud.
Nosotros Vosotros Ellos/
Ellas/

The following sentences show examples of these verbs:
Ellos no trajeron sus libros en clase. (They didn’t bring 
their books to class.)
¿Quién condujo? (Who drove?)
The preterit of dar and ver
The Spanish verbs dar and ver have the same irregular pret-
erit endings. You drop their respective -ar and -er infinitive 
endings and then add their preterit endings to d- and v-:

 Chapter 6: Revealing the Past 111

Here are a couple of example sentences:
Dimos un paseo por el parque. (We took a walk in the 
park.)
¿Qué vio Ud.? (What did you see?)
The preterit of ser and ir
The two irregular verbs ser (to be) and ir (to go) have the 
exact same preterit forms. How can you tell which verb is 
being used in a sentence? You have to look at the context of 
the sentence. The highly irregular conjugations of these two 
verbs are as follows:
ser (to be); ir (to go): fui, fuiste, fue, fuimos, fuisteis, 
fueron
The following examples show you how you can figure out the 
meaning of the verb in use:
ir: Yo fui al mercado. (I went to the market.)
ser: Yo fui el primero en terminar el trabajo. (I was the 
first to finish the work.)
Using the preterit
You can use the preterit tense in many ways to convey past 
actions, events, or states of mind. You use the preterit to 
express the following:
 
✓ An action or event that began at a specific time in the 
past:
 
 El avión despegó a las seis. (The plane took off at 6 
o’clock.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
112
 
✓ An action or event that was completed at a specific time 
in the past:
 
 Anoche fuimos a una fiesta. (Last night we went to a party.)
 
✓ An action or event that was completed in the past within 
a specific time period:
 
 Preparé la cena. (I prepared dinner.)
 
✓ A series of events that were completed within a definite 
time period in the past:
 
 Me desperté, me bañé, y me vestí antes de desayu-
narme. (I woke up, I bathed, and I got dressed before 
eating breakfast.)
Looking Back with the Imperfect
The imperfect tense is vague and imprecise. That’s why it’s 
called imperfect. When you know something happened in the 
past, but you’re not really sure when or how often, you use 
the imperfect tense. In English, you typically use the expres-
sions used to or always to describe these actions.
Forming the imperfect 
of regular verbs
Just like the preterit, forming the imperfect of regular verbs is 
rather easy. Although there are three different infinitive end-
ings for regular verbs — -ar, -er, and -ir — you use only two 
different sets of endings to form the imperfect of these verbs.
You form the imperfect of a regular verb by dropping the -ar, 
-er, or -ir infinitive ending and adding the proper imperfect 
ending, as shown in the tables that follow:
Here’s the imperfect conjugation of -ar verbs:
mirar (to look at)
yo miraba
nosotros mirábamos
tú mirabas
vosotros mirabais
él, ella, Ud. miraba
ellos, ellas, Uds. miraban

 Chapter 6: Revealing the Past 113
Here’s the imperfect conjugation of -er and -ir verbs:
beber (to drink)
yo bebía
nosotros bebíamos
tú bebías
vosotros bebíais
él, ella, Ud. bebía
ellos, ellas, Uds. bebían
recibir (to receive)
yo recibía
nosotros recibíamos
tú recibías
vosotros recibíais
él, ella, Ud. recibía
ellos, ellas, Uds. recibían
Here are some examples of the imperfect in action, using regu-
lar verbs:
Los turistas admiraban a los animales. (The tourists were 
admiring the animals.)
Los monos comían cacahuetes. (The monkeys were eating 
peanuts.)
Los tigres preferían dormirse. (The tigers preferred to go 
to sleep.)
Forming the imperfect 
of irregular verbs
Only three Spanish verbs are irregular in the imperfect tense:
Verb
Yo
Tú
Él/
Ella/
Ud.
Nosotros
Vosotros
Ellos/
Ellas/
Uds.
ir (to go)
iba
ibas
iba
íbamos
ibais
iban
ser (to be)
era
eras
era
éramos
erais
eran
ver (to see)
veía
veías
veía
veíamos
veíais
veían
Here are some examples of these verbs in the imperfect:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
114
Nosotros íbamos al restaurante. (We were going to the 
restaurant.)
Él era alto. (He was tall.)
Ellas veían a sus amigos los viernes. (They saw their 
friends on Fridays.)
 
Verbs that usually have stem or spelling changes in other 
tenses don’t change in the imperfect. So you don’t have to 
learn another set of rules or memorize another list of verbs. 
Hooray!
Using the imperfect
You’ll have no problem knowing when to use the imperfect 
tense if you can remember that the imperfect is a descriptive 
past tense. You use the imperfect in the following situations:
 
✓ To describe ongoing or continuous actions in the past 
(which may or may not have been completed):
 
• Yo lo veía todos los días. (I saw him every day.)
 
✓ To describe repeated or habitual actions that took place 
in the past:
 
• Ella viajaba mucho. (She used to travel a lot.)
 
✓ To describe an action that continued for an unspecified 
period of time:
 
• Vivíamos en México. (We lived in Mexico.)
 
✓ To describe a person, place, thing, weather condition, 
time, day of the week, state of mind, or emotion in the 
past:
 
• Estaba contento. (I was happy.)
 
• La casa era muy grande. (The house was very big.)
 
• Hacía frío. (It was cold.)
 
• Eran las dos. (It was two o’clock.)
 
• Era el lunes. (It was Monday.)
 
• Quería comprenderlo. (I wanted to understand it.)
 
• Creía que no era urgente. (He thought it wasn’t 
urgent.)

 Chapter 6: Revealing the Past 115
 
✓ To describe actions that took place simultaneously:
 
• Yo escuchaba la radio mientras mi amiga miraba 
la televisión. (I was listening to music while my 
friend was watching television.)
 
✓ To describe a situation that was going on in the past 
when another action or event, expressed by the preterit 
(covered earlier in this chapter), took place:
 
• Yo escuchaba la radio cuando alguien tocó el 
timbre. (I was listening to the radio when someone 
rang the doorbell.)
Choosing the Preterit 
or the Imperfect
The preterit tense expresses an action that was completed at 
a specific time in the past. You can represent such an event or 
action by drawing a dot. Boom! The action took place and was 
completed, and that’s the end of it.
The imperfect tense, on the other hand, expresses a past 
action that continued over an indefinite period of time. You 
can represent such an action or event with a wavy line: It just 
kept moving and moving without an end in sight. The action 
continued over a period of time in the past: It was happening, 
used to happen, or would (meaning “used to”) happen.
 
In some instances, either the preterit or the imperfect is 
acceptable as a past tense. The tense you use may depend on 
the meaning you want to convey. For instance, if you want to 
convey that the action was completed, you can say
Ella estudió. (She studied.)
If you want to convey that the action was ongoing or continu-
ous, you can say
Ella estudiaba. (She was studying.)

Signaling the preterit
You often use the preterit tense along with words and expres-
sions that specify a time period. Table 6-1 presents many of 
these common words and expressions.
Table 6-1

Here are some example sentences that show how you use 
these words with the preterit:
Anoche me quedé en casa. (Last night I stayed home.)
Finalmente, lo terminé. (Finally, I finished it.)
Signaling the imperfect
You often use the imperfect tense with words and expressions 
that imply habitual action or repetition in the past. Table 6-2 
lists many of these words and expressions.

Here are examples that show how you use the imperfect tense 
with some words and expressions from Table 6-2:
Normalmente regresaba a las seis. (You normally 
returned home at 6 o’clock.)
Siempre jugaban al tenis. (They always played tennis.)
Creating the Present Perfect
Each simple tense has a corresponding compound tense. 
A compound tense makes an action perfect or complete. In 
English, for example, you eat in the present, but you have 
eaten in the present perfect. In other words, you’re done 
eating in the present tense.
Forming the present perfect
Forming the present perfect in Spanish is essentially a two-
step process:

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
118
 
1. Begin with the present tense of the helping verb 
haber.
 
2. Tack on the past participle of the main verb.
Here’s haber conjugated in the present tense:
yo he
nosotros hemos
tú has
vosotros habéis
él (ella, Ud.) ha
ellos (ellas, ustedes) han
After you have the haber form, you need a past participle. 
Every verb has a past participle that expresses a completed 
action, such as taken, spoken, and danced. Forming the past 
participle in English has probably become second nature to 
you. In Spanish, you simply need to observe the following two 
rules for forming the regular past participles of -ar, -er, and -ir 
verbs:
 
✓ For -ar verbs, drop the -ar of the infinitive form and 
add -ado.
 
✓ For -er and -ir verbs, drop the -er or -ir of the infinitive 
form and add -ido.
 
Forming and using the past participles is equivalent to using 
-ed or -en endings in English.
Table 6-3 shows examples of each type of verb.
Table 6-3 
Past Participles of Regular Verbs
Infinitive
Past Participle
hablar (to speak)
hablado (spoken)
comer (to eat)

If an -er or -ir stem ends in a vowel, add an accent mark to the 
i as follows;

Using the present perfect
After you know how to conjugate the verb haber in the pres-
ent tense and form the past participle of some common verbs, 
you have everything you need to know to be able to form and 
use the present perfect.
Keep the following rules and regulations in mind:
 
✓ Use the present perfect to express or describe actions 
that have happened recently and/or actions that still 
hold true in the present, as in the sentences: “She has 
arrived,” or “They have lived here for two years (and 
still do).”
 
✓ Never separate the verb haber and the past participle 
with any other words.
 
✓ When using an object pronoun with the present perfect, 
the pronoun must precede the conjugated form of the 
verb haber.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
120
The sample sentences in the list that follows show the use of 
the present perfect:
Yo he terminado la carta. (I have finished the letter.)
Ellos han empezado la casa nueva. (They have started the 
new house.)
Ella ha leído aquella novela. (She has read that novel.)
 
The past participle remains the same for every subject. Only 
the helping verb changes:
Él ha dicho una mentira y ellas han dicho la verdad. (He 
has told a lie and they have told the truth.)

Chapter 7
Looking to the Future
In This Chapter
▶ Expressing the future in three ways
▶ Forming the future of regular and irregular verbs
▶ Putting the future to use
T
his chapter allows you to look toward the future. You 
discover how to use the present tense to express a future 
action. You practice using the Spanish verb ir (to go) + the 
preposition a to say what a subject is going to do. And you 
discover how to form the future of regular and irregular verbs, 
all with no spelling or stem changes!
Talking about the Future without 
Using the Future Tense
You can tell someone that something is going to happen in 
the future without knowing how to create the future tense of a 
Spanish verb. How cool is that? You can use the present tense 
in certain situations, and in other situations, you can use ir 
(to go) + the preposition a + an infinitive. In the following sec-
tions, we explain exactly when you can use these non-future 
constructions to convey the future.
Using the present to 
express the future
You use the present tense to imply the future when asking for 
instructions or when the proposed action will take place in 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
122
the not-so-distant or near future (see Chapter 3). Here are two 
examples of these usages:
¿Dejo de hablar? (Shall I stop talking?)
Ellos pasan por nuestra casa. (They’ll be stopping by our 
house.)
Expressing the near future
You use the present tense of the verb ir (to go) + the preposi-
tion a (which has no meaning in this particular construction) 
+ the infinitive of the verb to express an action that will be 
taking place rather soon or that’s imminent. First take a quick 
look at the irregular verb ir in the present tense:
ir (to go)
yo voy
nosotros vamos
tú vas
vosotros vais
él, ella, Ud. va
ellos, ellas, Uds. van
Here are some examples that use ir + a and allow you to 
express what the subject is going to do in the form of an 
infinitive:
Voy a salir. (I’m going to go out.)
Vamos a esperarlos. (We are going to wait for them.)
Mastering the Future Tense
When you want to talk about what a subject will do or what 
action or event will take place in the not-so-immediate future, 
you have to use the future tense of the verb. Here’s where the 
conjugation comes in, but don’t worry. Forming the future 
tense is a breeze compared to other verb tenses; you can see 
what we mean in the following sections on regular and irregu-
lar verbs.

 Chapter 7: Looking to the Future 123
Forming the future 
of regular verbs
The future tense in Spanish is just about as easy to form as 
possible, because all verbs — every single one of them: regu-
lar verbs, verbs with spelling and stem changes, and irregular 
verbs — have the same future endings. Well, some verbs do 
have irregular future stems, but that’s only a few (see the fol-
lowing section for more on these verbs).
To form the future tense of a regular verb, you add the appro-
priate future ending (dependent on the subject) to the infini-
tive of the verb:
Future Endings for All Verbs
yo -é
nosotros -emos
tú -ás
vosotros -éis
él, ella, Ud. -á
ellos, ellas, Uds. -án
The tables that follow show how you use these endings to 
form the future of regular verbs:
 
✓ -ar verbs:
trabajar (to work)
yo trabajaré
nosotros trabajaremos
tú trabajarás
vosotros trabajaréis
él, ella, Ud. trabajará
ellos, ellas, Uds. trabajarán
 
✓ -er verbs:
vender (to sell)
yo venderé
nosotros venderemos
tú venderás
vosotros venderéis
él, ella, Ud. venderá
ellos, ellas, Uds. venderán

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
124
 
✓ -ir verbs:
discutir (to discuss, argue)
yo discutiré
nosotros discutiremos
tú discutirás
vosotros discutiréis
él, ella, Ud. discutirá
ellos, ellas, Uds. discutirán
Now check out some example sentences that use the future 
tense:
Yo no los invitaré a mi fiesta. (I won’t invite them to my 
party.)
Ellos no beberán alcohol. (They won’t drink alcohol.)
¿Abrirás una cuenta bancaria pronto? (Will you open a 
bank account soon?)
 
Verbs whose infinitives contain an accent mark over the 
i, such as oír (to listen) and reír (to laugh), — drop their 
accents in the future tense:
Yo no oiré esas mentiras. (I won’t listen to those lies.)
Ellos no se reirán de él. (They won’t laugh at him.)
 
When conjugating reflexive verbs in the future tense, the 
reflexive pronoun goes in front of the conjugated verb form. 
(Check out Chapter 3 for more on reflexive verbs.)
Me acostaré temprano esta noche. (I’m going to go to bed 
early tonight.)
Forming the future 
of irregular verbs
Certain Spanish verbs are irregular in the future tense. These 
verbs have irregular future stems, which always end in -r or 
-rr — an easy way to remember them! To form the future of 
these irregular verbs, you do one of three things:

 Chapter 7: Looking to the Future 125
 
✓ Drop e from the infinitive ending before adding the 
appropriate future ending:
Infinitive
Meaning
Future Stem
caber
to fit
cabr-
haber
to have
habr-
poder
to be able
podr-
querer
to want
querr-
saber
to know
sabr-
 
 Here are some example sentences:
 
• ¿Cabrá esa máquina en el gabinete? (Will that 
machine fit in the cabinet?)
 
• No podremos venir. (We will not be able to come.)
 
✓ Drop e or i from the infinitive ending and replace the vowel 
with a d before adding the appropriate future ending:
Infinitive
Meaning
Future Stem
poner
to put
pondr-
salir
to leave
saldr-
tener
to have
tendr-
valer
to be worth
valdr-
venir
to come
vendr-
 
 Three of these verbs are illustrated in the following 
example sentences:
 
• ¿Cuándo saldrán? (When will they leave?)
 
• ¿Cuánto valdrá ese coche? (How much will that car 
be worth?)
 
• ¿No vendrás mañana? (Won’t you be coming 
tomorrow?)
 
✓ Memorize the irregular stems and add the appropriate 
future endings. At this level, you need to know only two 
high-frequency irregular verbs in Spanish that are irregu-
lar in the future:
Infinitive
Meaning

decir
to say

hacer

 Observe these verbs in action:
 
• Yo diré lo que pienso. (I will say what I think.)
 
• ¿Qué harán para resolver el problema? (What will 
they do to solve the problem?)
Using the Future to Foretell, 
Predict, and Wonder
Using the future tense to express future time seems kind of 
obvious. However, you must be aware of other instances in 
Spanish when you may use the future, too. For instance, you 
use the future
 
✓ To predict a future action or event:
 
• Lloverá pronto. (It will rain soon.)
 
✓ To express wonder, probability, conjecture, or uncer-
tainty in the present. The Spanish future, in this case, 
is the equivalent to the following English phrases: “I 
wonder,” “probably,” or “must be.”
 
• ¿Cuánto dinero tendrán? (I wonder how much 
money they have.)
 
• Serán las seis. (It’s probably [It must be] six o’clock.)
 
• Alguien viene. ¿Quién será? (Someone is coming. I 
wonder who it is?)
 
• ¿Será mi esposo? (I wonder if it’s my husband.)
 
• ¿Me dará un anillo mi novio? (I wonder if my boy-
friend is going to give me a ring.)
 
✓ To express something that you expect and that’s due to 
or caused by a present action or event:
 
• Si viene a tiempo, el jefe no se quejará. (If you 
come on time, the boss won’t complain.)
 
• Si sigues la receta, prepararás una buena comida. 
(If you follow the recipe, you’ll prepare a good meal.)

Identifying Verb Moods
In This Chapter
▶ Issuing commands
▶ Understanding the present subjunctive
▶ Speculating with the present perfect subjunctive
▶ Using the conditional
I
n other chapters in this book, we cover verb tenses (past, 
present, future, and so on). In this chapter, we explain dif-
ferent moods of verbs. No, we don’t mean angry or excited 
verbs. A verb’s mood reflects the subject’s attitude toward 
what the verb expresses. Moods come in four flavors:
 
✓ The indicative mood, the most commonly used, states a 
fact and requires the present, past, or future tense. (See 
Chapters 3, 6, and 7 for more on these tenses.)
 
✓ The imperative mood requires a command.
 
✓ The subjunctive is a mood that shows wishing, want-
ing, emotion, need, or doubt (among other things) and 
requires special verb forms.
 
✓ The conditional mood indicates what would happen under 
certain circumstances.
In this chapter, we focus on commands, the present and pres-
ent perfect subjunctive, and the conditional moods.

When you tell a waiter to bring you water, ask a dinner guest 
to please pass the salt, or tell your dog to lie down, you’re 
using the imperative mood. You’re giving a command — 
telling someone, or sometimes yourself, to do something.
 
In most cases, you bark out commands in the you form, but 
remember that in Spanish you can mean any of four different 
yous. With the imperative, you can also give what is called a 
let’s command, as in, “Let’s go to the movie.” This less asser-
tive form of the imperative takes the nosotros form.
Forming commands with 
Ud. and Uds.
When forming the formal you singular, that is, the usted (Ud.), 
commands in the affirmative and the negative forms, you drop 
the -o ending of the yo form, and add an -e for -ar verbs or an 
-a for -er and -ir verbs. Here are a few examples:
¡Hable! (Speak!)
¡No hable! (Don’t speak!)
¡Coma! (Eat!)
¡No coma! (Don’t eat!)
¡Escriba! (Write!)
¡No escriba! (Don’t write!)
Spanish has only the following three irregular usted commands:
Infinitive
Positive Command
Negative Command
ir
¡Vaya! (Go!)
¡No vaya! (Don’t go)
saber
¡Sepa! (Know!)
¡No sepa! (Don’t know!)
ser
¡Sea! (Be!)
¡No sea! (Don’t be!)
 
The verbs dar (to give) and estar (to be) add accents in the 
following formal command forms to maintain proper stress:
dar: ¡Dé (Ud.)! (Give!)
estar: ¡Esté (Ud.)! (Be!) 
¡Estén (Uds.)! (Give!)

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 129
When forming the formal, plural you or ustedes (Uds.) com-
mands, you simply add an -n to the Ud. command form. This 
rule applies for the regular and irregular verbs, as shown in 
the following examples:
Hablen. (Speak!)
¡No coman! (Don’t eat!)
Escriban. (Write!)
¡No sean tontos! (Don’t be foolish!)
Forming commands with 
tú and vosotros
You can form positive tú commands by dropping the -s from 
the present tense tú forms of regular -ar, -er, or -ir verbs:
 
✓ Hablas (you speak) becomes ¡Habla! (Speak!)
 
✓ Comes (you eat) becomes ¡Come! (Eat!)
 
✓ Escribes (you write) becomes ¡Escribe! (Write!)
You can form negative tú commands by taking the -o off of the 
present-tense yo form and adding -es for regular -ar verbs and 
-as for regular -er and -ir verbs:
 
✓ Hablo (I speak) becomes ¡No hables! (Don’t speak!)
 
✓ Como (I eat) becomes ¡No comas! (Don’t eat!)
 
✓ Escribo (I write) becomes ¡No escribas! (Don’t write!)
Spanish also includes some irregular tú form commands. 
Table 8-1 shows the positive and negative forms of the most 
common irregular tú form commands.

venir (to come)
Ven

Here is an example:
¡No tengas miedo sino que ten cuidado! (Don’t be afraid, 
but be careful!)
When forming the positive, informal, plural you or vosotros 
commands for regular verbs, you drop the -r from the infini-
tive form and add -d, as you can see in the following examples:
¡Hablad! (Speak!)
¡Comed! (Eat!)
¡Escribid! (Write!)
When forming the negative vosotros commands, you simply 
drop the -o from the present-tense yo form and add -éis for -ar 
verbs or -áis for -er and -ir verbs, as follows:
¡No habléis! (Don’t speak!)
¡No comáis! (Don’t eat!)
¡No escribáis! (Don’t write!)
The same three verbs are irregular in the negative vosotros 
command forms as in the usted forms. They are
Infinitive
Negative Command
ir
¡No vayáis! (Don’t go!)
saber
No sepáis . . . (Don’t know . . .)
ser
No seáis . . . (Don’t be . . .)
 
Dar (to give) drops the accent in the negative vosotros com-
mand: ¡No deis! (Don’t give!)

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 131
Forming the let’s command
The nosotros-form commands, or the let’s commands, enable 
you to make suggestions to your friends or to a group of 
people (including yourself) about what you want to do. When 
forming these commands, take the -o off of the present-tense 
yo form of the verb and add -emos for -ar verbs or -amos 
for -er and -ir verbs. You simply put no in front of the verb 
to make a negative let’s command. Some examples follow in 
Table 8-2.
Table 8-2 
Let’s Commands with Regular Verbs
Infinitive (Ending)
Positive Command

hablar (-ar) (to speak)
Hablemos.
No hablemos.
comer (-er) (to eat)
Comamos.
No comamos.
escribir (-ir) (to write)
Escribamos.
No escribamos.
For example:
¡No hablemos! ¡Comamos! (Let’s not speak! Let’s eat!)
The three verbs in Table 8-3 are irregular in the nosotros com-
mand form, both in their affirmative and the negative formations. 
Note that ir is different in its affirmative and negative forms.

the park! Let’s go to the movies!)

Forming the Present Subjunctive
So, you’re unfamiliar with the subjunctive. We’re not at all 
surprised — it’s not that commonly discussed in English. It 
indicates how the speaker feels about or perceives a situation 
rather than when an action occurred. In this section, you dis-
cover how to form the present subjunctive (which we some-
times refer to here as just “the subjunctive”) of regular verbs, 
verbs with spelling changes, verbs with stem changes, and 
completely irregular verbs.
Creating the present subjunctive 
of regular verbs
You form the present subjunctive of regular verbs by drop-
ping the -o from the yo form of the present tense and adding 
the subjunctive endings shown in bold in Table 8-4. These 
endings are relatively easy to remember, because -ar verbs 
(such as hablar) use the present-tense endings of -er verbs, 
and -er (comprender) and -ir (escribir) verbs use the present-
tense endings of -ar verbs. This switch is why people say that 
you form the present subjunctive by using the opposite verb 
endings on the stem.

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 133
Here are some examples of these verbs in the subjunctive:
Es importante que yo hable con sus padres. (It is impor-
tant that I speak to your parents.)
Es esencial que Ud. comprenda las reglas. (It is essential 
that you understand the rules.)
Es necesario que nosotros escribamos las notas. (It is 
necessary that we write the notes.)
Working with verbs irregular 
in the yo form
Some verbs are irregular in the yo form of the present tense. 
These verbs use the stem of the yo to form the present sub-
junctive. You drop the final -o from the yo form and add the 
opposite endings. In other words, you add an ending that 
starts with -a for the -er and -ir verbs listed in Table 8-5.

Es imposible que todo quepa en mi maleta. (It’s impos-
sible that everything will fit in my suitcase.)
Es urgente que Uds. hagan todo este trabajo ahora. (It is 
urgent that you do all this work now.)
Tackling verbs with 
spelling changes
Some Spanish verbs have the same spelling change in the 
present subjunctive as they have in the present tense. 
Namely, verbs ending in -cer/-cir, -ger/-gir, and -guir (not -uir) 
undergo the same changes that occur in the yo form of the 
present. These changes are as follows:
 
✓ vowel + -cer/-cir verbs: c → zc
 
✓ consonant + -cer /-cir verbs: c → z
 
✓ -ger/-gir verbs: g → j
 
✓ -guir verbs: gu → g
Use the regular subjunctive ending after making the spelling 
changes shown in Table 8-6.

The following examples illustrate these spelling changes:

de salario. (It is a pity that the director isn’t offering him a 
raise.)
Es natural que el jefe exija mucho de sus empleados. (It 
is natural that the boss demands a lot from his employees.)
 
You see some different spelling changes for verbs in the pres-
ent subjunctive than you see for verbs with spelling changes 
in the present tense. In the present subjunctive, verbs ending 
in -car, -gar, and -zar undergo changes. They have the same 
changes as in the preterit (or the past tense; see Chapter 6). 
These changes are as follows:
 
✓ -car verbs: c → qu
 
✓ -gar verbs: g → gu
 
✓ -zar verbs: z → c

him to organize the data.)
Coping with stem changes
Just like in the present tense, stem-changing -ar and -er verbs 
in the present subjunctive undergo changes in all forms except 
nosotros and vosotros. Table 8-7 outlines these changes.

window.)

they will return early.)
And what about -ir verbs? Well, -ir verbs with e → ie and o → 
ue stem changes make those same changes in all forms except 

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 137
nosotros and vosotros. The nosotros and vosotros forms 
change e to i and o to u, respectively. Those with an e → i 
stem change use i instead of e in all forms including nosotros 
and vosotros, as shown in Table 8-8.

Here are some examples of -ir verbs in the subjunctive:

prefer to see a Spanish film.)
Su padre está enojado que él duerma hasta las diez. (His 
father is angry that he sleeps until ten o’clock.)
Es dudoso que sirvan vino en la conferencia. (It is doubt-
ful that they will serve wine at the conference.)
The changes don’t end with simple -ar, -er, and -ir verbs, how-
ever. Note the stem changes for the following categories of 
verbs that end with an additional vowel:
 
✓ Verbs that end in -iar have accent marks in all present 
subjunctive forms except nosotros:
 
 enviar (to send): envíe, envíes, envíe, enviemos, enviéis, 
envíen
 
✓ Verbs that end in -uar have accent marks in all present 
subjunctive forms except nosotros:
 
 continuar (to continue): continúe, continúes, continúe, 
continuemos, continuéis, continúen
 
✓ Verbs that end in -uir (but not -guir) add a y after the u 
in all present subjunctive forms:
 
 concluir (to conclude): concluya, concluyas, concluya, 
concluyamos, concluyáis, concluyan

The following examples show these rules in action:
Es importante que Ud. envíe este paquete inmediata-
mente. (It is important that you send this package 
immediately.)
Me enfada que Ud. no continúe estudiando español. (I’m 
annoyed that you don’t continue to study Spanish.)
El profesor desea que los estudiantes concluyan su 
trabajo. (The teacher wants the students to complete their 
work.)
Understanding verbs with both 
spelling and stem changes

stem changes in the present subjunctive form, as shown in

Conjugating irregular verbs
Some verbs are completely irregular in the subjunctive mood, 
which means you can’t follow any rules or patterns to form 
them. You can do nothing else but memorize them. Table 8-10 
presents these verbs.

Here are some examples of irregular verbs in the subjunctive:

that your grandmother is sick.)
Yo dudo que él sepa reparar la computadora. (I doubt 
that he knows how to repair the computer.)
Using the Present Subjunctive
The subjunctive mood is tentative and uncertain. It enables 
you to wish, desire, and suppose whenever reality falls short 
of expectations. It allows you to put all your shortcomings 

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
140
behind you and suppose, just for the time being, that you’re 
something you’re not or that certain conditions are in place 
that aren’t really in place — “If only I were rich . . .” The sub-
junctive also enables you to add a pinch of doubt to state-
ments and offer impersonal opinions, so you can express 
yourself without being overly committal. It’s an empowering 
grammatical construction.
The present subjunctive has many applications, which makes 
it a very useful tool for you to have. It allows you to express 
your innermost hopes, desires, and dreams; your most press-
ing needs; your wildest doubts; and your humblest opinions. 
Furthermore, it allows you to give advice, to insist on receiv-
ing what you want, to offer suggestions, and to demand the 
necessities of life. And you can execute these expressions in a 
very low-key, gentle way.
How do you know when to use the present subjunctive? You 
must use the subjunctive in Spanish (whether or not you’d 
use it in English) when all the following conditions exist within 
a sentence:
 
✓ The sentence contains a main (or independent) clause — 
a group of words containing a subject and a verb that can 
stand alone as a sentence — and a subordinate (or depen-
dent) clause — a group of words containing a subject 
and a verb that can’t stand alone. Generally, each clause 
must contain a different subject.
 
✓ The main clause shows, among other things, wishing, 
wanting, emotion, doubt, need, necessity, feelings, emo-
tions, commands or orders, supposition, speculation, or 
opinion.
 
✓ Que (that) joins the main clause to the dependent clause, 
which contains a verb in the subjunctive.
 
 When you use the subjunctive in English (and most 
people do so without even realizing it), you often omit 
the word that. In Spanish, however, you must always use 
que to join the two clauses:
Es improbable que yo salga esta noche. (It is improbable 
[that] I’ll go out tonight.)
(No) Es extraño que él haga eso. (It is [not] strange [that] 
he’s doing that.)

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 141
 
✓ The verb in the main clause is in the present, the future 
(see Chapter 7), or a command (see “Giving Commands 
with the Imperative Mood” earlier in this chapter).
Expressing your desires, 
needs, or doubts
One of the coolest features of the subjunctive mood is that it 
enables you to express desire, hope, or preference; offer sug-
gestions, recommendations, or advice; and even insist or beg 
for what you want. In other words, even though you may not 
get what you want, you can certainly ask for it, hope for it, 
and even insist on it. These expressions of desire, hope, and 
preference require a combination of two clauses:
 
✓ The main clause expresses the desire, doubt, or opinion 
in the indicative mood (statement of fact): “I hope . . . ,” 
“Sally advises . . . ,” or “Pedro prefers . . .”
 
✓ The subordinate clause describes that which is being 
desired, doubted, or offered as an opinion, and you 
express it in the subjunctive mood. Using the first main 
clause (from the previous bullet) as an example: I hope 
“that my package arrives tomorrow.”
The following list shows verbs that express wishing, emotion, 
need, doubt, advice, command, demand, desire, hope, permis-
sion, preference, prohibition, request, suggestion, or want-
ing and, therefore, require the use of the subjunctive in the 
subordinate clause. (Verbs with a * require a spelling or stem 
change; see the earlier “Forming the Present Subjunctive” sec-
tion for more on making these changes.)

demands that you arrive on time.)

If no doubt exists in the thought you want to express, you use 
the indicative (past, present, or future):
Él no duda que yo merezco el premio. (He doesn’t doubt 
that I deserve the award.)
Yo creo que ella es muy inteligente. (I believe she is very 
intelligent.)

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 143
If the certainty is negated or questioned, however, you use 
the subjunctive:
¿No piensas que ese libro sea interesante? (Don’t you 
think that book is interesting?)
Demonstrating feelings 
or emotions
When the main clause of a Spanish sentence contains the 
word estar (to be) followed by an adjective that expresses 
feelings or emotions, you use the subjunctive in the depen-
dent clause. To complete the sentence, you insert the words 
de que (that) after the adjective:
Estoy alegre de que Uds. me acompañen al cine. (I’m 
happy that you are accompanying me to the movies.)
No estamos contentos de que tú pierdas el tiempo. (We 
are not happy that you are wasting time.)
The following table lists many Spanish adjectives that express 
feelings or emotions (for more on adjectives, head to Chapter 4):
Spanish
English
alegre
happy
avergonzado (-a)
embarrassed, ashamed
contento (-a)
happy
encantado (-a)
delighted
enojado (-a)
angry
feliz
happy
furioso (-a)
furious
irritado (-a)
irritated
orgulloso (-a)
proud
triste
sad
 
You use the subjunctive after the adverbs tal vez (perhaps) 
and quizás (perhaps) to imply doubt or uncertainty. When 
you want to express certainty, you use the indicative:
Tal vez (Quizás) vayan a la Ameríca del Sur. (Perhaps 
they will go to South America.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
144
Employing impersonal expressions
You use an impersonal expression to convey personal infor-
mation and ideas without making any one person the owner. 
The impersonal expression acts as the main clause of the 
sentence and is joined to the thoughts you want to relate by 
que (that). When this expression shows wishing, uncertainty, 
need, emotion, and so on, it requires the subjunctive in the 
dependent clause that follows.
 
Many (although not all) impersonal expressions begin with es 
(it is) and are followed by adjectives showing wishing, emo-
tion, doubt, need, and so on. They require the subjunctive 
even if they’re negated:
No es urgente que me telefonee. (It isn’t urgent that you 
call me.)
The following table lists some of the most common Spanish 
impersonal expressions that require the subjunctive:
Spanish

it is advisable that
es absurdo que

Here are some examples that show how an impersonal expres-

opinion:
Es sorprendente que esa mujer sea tan irresponsable. 
(It is surprising that that woman is so irresponsible.)
Es injusto que estas personas no puedan votar. (It is 
unfair that these people can’t vote.)
 
Be careful! When impersonal expressions show certainty 
(such as the following), you must use the indicative (present, 
past, or future):
Spanish
English
es cierto
it is certain, it is sure
es claro
it is clear
es evidente
it is evident
es exacto
it is exact
es obvio
it is obvious
es seguro
it is sure
es verdad
it is true
parece
it seems

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
146
Es obvio que nuestros precios son competitivos. (It is 
obvious that our prices are competitive.)
Es claro que Ud. tiene razón. (It is clear that you are 
right.)
However, impersonal expressions that show certainty when 
used in the affirmative express doubt or denial when they’re 
negated and, therefore, require the subjunctive:
Es cierto que el avión despega pronto. (It is certain that 
the plane will take off soon.)
No es cierto que el avión despegue pronto. (It is uncertain 
that the plane will take off soon.)
Using relative clauses
You use the subjunctive in relative clauses, where the person 
or thing mentioned in the main clause
 
✓ Is indefinite
 
✓ Is nonexistent
 
✓ Is sought after but not yet attained
 
✓ May or may not exist
In other words, the subject of the sentence just isn’t sure or is 
in doubt about the availability of the person or thing. Here are 
two examples:
Busco un mecánico que sepa reparar mi coche. (I am 
looking for a mechanic who knows how to repair my car.)
 
Because of the indefinite quality of mecánico, you don’t use 
the impersonal a here.
Conozco a un mecánico que sabe reparar mi coche. (I 
know a mechanic who knows how to repair my car.)
Note that in the first sentence, the subject is unsure if such 
a person can be found. In the second sentence, however, the 
subject has no doubt that the person exists, so the present 
tense, rather than the present subjunctive, is required.

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 147
Playing with the Present 
Perfect Subjunctive
You use the present perfect subjunctive when the verb in the 
main clause is in the present tense, and the dependent verb 
refers to an event that has taken place.
You form the present perfect subjunctive by conjugating the 
helping verb haber in the present subjunctive and adding the 
past participle of the main verb. (See Chapter 6.)
The following chart shows the verb haber conjugated in the 
present subjunctive:
haber [helping verb] (to have)
 
haya
 
hayamos
 
hayas
 
hayáis
 
haya
 
hayan
Here’s an example of how you combine a conjugation of haber 
with a past participle to form the present perfect subjunctive:
Espero que ellos hayan terminado su trabajo a tiempo. 
(I hope that they have finished their work on time.)
Making Actions Conditional
Should’ve, could’ve, would’ve . . . that’s what the conditional 
mood is all about. If the conditions were appropriate, the action 
should’ve, could’ve, or would’ve resulted . . . theoretically 
speaking. Simply put, you use the conditional mood to express 
a conditional action. But you can also use it to make a polite 
request or to subtly, or not so subtly, suggest that someone 
perform a certain action.

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
148
Forming the conditional 
of regular verbs
When conjugating Spanish verbs in the regular conditional 
mood, keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ The regular conditional mood is a combination of the 
future (see Chapter 7) and imperfect tenses (see 
Chapter 6).
 
✓ The regular conditional tense requires no spelling or 
stem changes.
When conjugating regular -ar, -er, and -ir verbs in the condi-
tional tense, you simply take the entire verb infinitive (don’t 
drop anything) and then add the imperfect verb endings you 
use for -er and -ir verbs: -ía, -ías,  ía, -íamos, -íais, and -ían, as 
shown in the tables below:
preparar (to prepare)
yo prepararía
nosotros prepararíamos
tú prepararías
vosotros prepararíais
él, ella, Ud. prepararía
ellos, ellas, Uds. prepararían
Ud. prepararía la comida. (You (formal) would prepare the meal.)
vender (to sell)
yo vendería
nosotros venderíamos
tú venderías
vosotros venderíais
él, ella, Ud. vendería
ellos, ellas, Uds. venderían
Vosotras venderíais el coche. (You (plural, female, familiar) would 
sell the car)
escribir (to write)
yo escribiría
nosotros escribiríamos
tú escribirías
vosotros escribiríais
él, ella, Ud. escribiría
ellos, ellas, Uds. escribirían
Ella escribiría la carta. (She would write the letter.)

 Chapter 8: Identifying Verb Moods 149
Here is an example of the conditional in use:
Yo no jugaría al golf. (I wouldn’t play golf.)
Exploring verbs with irregular 
conditional forms
Certain Spanish verbs are irregular in the conditional. These 
verbs have irregular conditional stems, which always end in 
-r or -rr — an easy way to remember them! To form the condi-
tional of these irregular verbs, you do one of three things:
 
✓ Drop e from the infinitive ending before adding the 
proper conditional ending:
Infinitive
Conditional Stem
caber (to fit)
cabr-
haber (to have)
habr-
poder (to be able)
podr-
querer (to want)
querr-
saber (to know)
sabr-
 
 Here is an example sentence:
 
 No querría verlo. (I wouldn’t want to see it.)
 
✓ Drop e or i from the infinitive ending and replace the 
vowel with a d before adding the proper conditional 
ending:
Infinitive
Conditional Stem
poner (to put)
pondr-
salir (to leave)
saldr-
tener (to have)
tendr-
valer (to be worth)
valdr-
venir (to come)
vendr-
 
 Here’s a sentence illustrating the conditional:
 
 Yo no pondría esos papeles en la mesa. (I wouldn’t put 
those papers on the table.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
150
 
✓ Two high-frequency irregular verbs in the conditional are
Infinitive
Conditional Stem
decir (to say)
dir-
hacer (to make, to do)
har-
 
 Observe these verbs in action:
 
 Yo no diría eso. (I wouldn’t say that.)
 
 ¿Qué harían para resolver el problema? (What would 
they do to solve the problem?)
Using the conditional
You use the conditional
 
✓ To express what would or could happen in the future:
 
 Viajaría a España. (I would travel to Spain.)
 
✓ To make a polite request:
 
 Me gustaría un helado. (I would like an ice cream.)
 
✓ To express wonderment or probability in the past:
 
 ¿Dónde estaría mi gato? (I wonder where my cat was.)
 
 Estaría debajo de la mesa. (It must have been under the 
table.)
 
A sentence containing an if clause requires an advanced tense 
of the subjunctive that we don’t discuss in this book.

Chapter 9
Ten Important Verb 
Distinctions
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding verb mix-ups and selecting the proper verb
▶ Understanding different verb connotations
Just like in English, you can describe actions or situations 
in Spanish by using different verbs, depending on the 
exact meaning you want to convey. In this chapter, we pres-
ent ten pairs of Spanish verbs that are often misused because 
they have the same English meanings but different English 
connotations. We explain how you can determine which to 
use in any given situation.
Ser versus Estar
The verbs ser and estar always cause considerable confusion, 
because both verbs mean to be. You use each of these verbs 
differently, however.
You use ser to express the following:
 
✓ An inherent characteristic or quality (one that probably 
won’t change any time soon):
 
• Mi abuela es vieja. (My grandmother is old.)
 
✓ The identity of the subject:
 
• Mi padre es abogado. (My father is a lawyer.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
152
 
✓ The date, time, or place of an event:
 
• Es jueves. (It’s Thursday.)
 
• Son las once. (It’s eleven o’clock.)
 
• ¿Dónde es el concierto? (Where is the concert?)
 
✓ Origin and nationality:
 
• Ella es de Cuba. (She is from Cuba.)
 
• Ella es cubana. (She is Cuban.)
 
✓ Ownership:
 
• Es mi perro. (It’s my dog.)
 
✓ Material:
 
• Es de oro. (It’s made of gold.)
 
✓ An impersonal idea:
 
• Es fácil escribir en español. (It’s easy to write in 
Spanish.)
On the other hand, you use estar to express
 
✓ Health:
 
 ¿Cómo estás? Estoy bien. (How are you? I’m fine.)
 
✓ Location, situation, or position:
 
 El diccionario está en la mesa. (The dictionary is on the 
table.)
 
✓ Temporary conditions or states:
 
 Ella está ocupada. (She is busy.)
 
✓ The progressive tense (see Chapter 3):
 
 El niño está durmiendo. (The child is sleeping.)
Saber versus Conocer
Both saber and conocer mean to know. Saber expresses 
knowing how to do something or knowing a fact. Conocer 
expresses knowing in the sense of being acquainted with a 
person, place, thing, or idea. Note the differences in the fol-
lowing examples:

 Chapter 9: Ten Important Verb Distinctions 153
Yo sé hablar español. (I know how to speak Spanish.)
Ella sabe mi nombre. (She knows my name.)
Sabemos el poema. (We know the poem [by heart].)
Yo conozco al señor López. (I know Mr. López.)
¿Conoces este libro? (Do you know [Are you acquainted 
with] this book?)
Conocemos el poema. (We know [are acquainted with] the 
poem.)
Tomar versus Llevar
Determining the correct usage for tomar and llevar can be a 
bit tricky. Both verbs mean to take. You use tomar when the 
subject picks up something in his or her hands in order to 
physically carry it to another location. You use llevar when 
the subject is taking or leading a person/thing to a place or is 
carrying or transporting an item.
 
In most instances, if you can substitute the word “lead” or 
“carry” for “take,” you should use the verb llevar. If you can’t 
substitute one of those words, you should use tomar.
Here are some examples to help clarify:
Tomo tu lápiz. (I’m taking your pencil.)
Tomó el niño de la mano. (He took the child by the hand.)
Llevo a mi hermano a la playa. (I’m taking my brother to 
the beach.)
Llevaron su coche al garaje. (They took their car to the 
garage.)
You can compare the two verbs at work in this example 
sentence:
Tomé mi libro y lo llevé a la escuela. (I took my book and 
I brought it to school.)

Spanish Essentials For Dummies 
154
Deber versus Tener Que
You use both deber and tener que to express what a subject 
must or has to do. You generally use deber to express a moral 
obligation, whereas tener que expresses what has to be done:
Debes pedir permiso antes de salir. (You must ask for 
permission before going out.)
Tengo que ir al dentista porque tengo un dolor de 
las muelas. (I have to go to the dentist because I have a 
toothache.)
Preguntar versus Pedir
Preguntar and pedir both mean to ask. You use preguntar to 
show that the subject is asking a question or inquiring about 
someone or something. You use pedir to show that the sub-
ject is asking for or requesting something in particular:
Yo le pregunté por qué me pidió tu dirección. (I asked 
him why he asked me for your address.)
Jugar versus Tocar
Jugar and tocar both mean to play. You use jugar when the 
subject is engaging in a sport or game. You use tocar when 
the subject is playing a musical instrument:
Ellos jugaban a los naipes mientras yo tocaba el piano. 
(They were playing cards while I was playing the piano.)
Gastar versus Pasar
If you’re into spending, gastar and pasar are the verbs you 
need. Those who love to spend money use gastar, but people 
who spend time engaging in an activity should use pasar:
Pasé dos semanas en México y gasté mucho dinero allí. 
(I spent two weeks in Mexico, and I spent a lot of money 
there.)

 Chapter 9: Ten Important Verb Distinctions 155
Dejar versus Salir
Dejar expresses that the subject has left something behind, 
whereas salir expresses that the subject has left a place:
Voy a dejar mis gafas en casa. (I am going to leave my 
glasses at home.)
Ella no puede salir sin ellos. (She can’t leave without 
them.)
Volver versus Devolver
Volver (ue) and devolver (ue) both have the same meaning — 
to return — and you conjugate them in the same way. Use 
volver when the subject is physically returning to a place. Use 
devolver when the subject is returning an item to its owner:
Siempre le devuelvo a ella sus llaves cuando vuelve 
a casa. (I always return her keys to her when she returns 
home.)
Poder versus Saber
Poder and saber can be a tricky pair of verbs. Both verbs 
mean can, but here’s how they differ: Poder shows that the 
subject has the ability to perform an action, and saber shows 
that the subject actually knows how to perform the action.
 
If you can substitute the words “knows how to” for “can,” 
you should use saber. Otherwise, use poder. Here are some 
examples:
Yo puedo cocinar. (I can cook.)
Here you’re saying that you have the ability to cook, but 
that doesn’t necessarily mean that you know how to cook.
Yo sé cocinar. (I can cook.)
Now you’re saying that, yes, you know how to cook!

his appendix is the place to look if you’ve forgotten a verb 
conjugation and don’t have the patience to scan the table 
of contents and then search for the proper table in the book.

the conjugations for all the verbs you need in many Spanish 
tenses and moods.
Regular Verbs
