Preface
Internet of Things (IoT) is the third wave of Internet and is supposed to have a potential 
to connect about 28 billion items by 2020, ranging from bracelets to cars. The term “IoT,” 
which was first proposed by Kevin Ashton, a British technologist, in 1999, has the potential 
to impact everything from new product opportunities to shop floor optimization to fac-
tory worker efficiency gains that will power top-line and bottom-line gains. It is believed 
that IoT will improve energy efficiency, remote monitoring, and control of physical assets 
and productivity through applications as diverse as home security to condition monitor-
ing on the factory floor. Now IoT has been used in markets in the field of health care, home 
appliances and buildings, retail markets, energy and manufacturing companies, mobility 
and transportation, logistics companies, and by media.
Equipments are becoming more digitized and more connected, establishing networks 
between machines, humans, and the Internet, leading to the creation of new ecosystems 
that enable higher productivity, better energy efficiency, and higher profitability. Sensors 
help to recognize the state of things, by which they gain the advantage of anticipating 
human needs based on the information collected per context. These intelligent devices 
not only gather information from their environment but are also capable of taking deci-
sions without human intervention. IoT technology is being used in our day-to-day life for 
unlocking the door without a key; in card recognizers, automatic locks, vehicle detecting 
systems, toll payment system; and for tracking animals, access control, payment systems, 
contactless smart cards, anti-theft devices, steering column reader, etc. The IoT building 
blocks will come from those that are web-enabled devices, providing common platforms 
on which they can communicate, and develop new applications to capture new users.
In this background, this book is an attempt to present updated information on the 
recent trends on the issues involved, highlighting the challenges involved, and source the 
solutions for some of these challenges. The book comprises 14 chapters. The chapterwise 
description of contents in the volume is as follows.
For seamless visual tracking of passengers traveling in a vehicle, the visual light trans-
mission (VLT) and visual light reflectance (VRT) values of the glass windows used in the 
vehicle should be at a particular value. All vehicle manufacturers follow certain standards. 
But the vehicle owner/user generally buys window-tinting films from the gray market 
and pastes the same on the glass windows, which in turn hamper the visibility, thereby 
preventing the law enforcement authorities from having a clear view of those traveling 
in the vehicle. In Chapter 1, a proposal for the automatic detection of tint level for vehi-
cles is presented. The system has been designed using ordinary cameras that work in 
the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The system is capable of identifying a 
vehicle’s registered number using algorithms developed for this purpose. Various filtering 
techniques are applied to find the level of tint from the captured camera images. Using 
three different techniques, namely, color segmentation, contour detection, and histogram 
analysis, the tint level of windshield/window region is estimated. Thus, the IoT system 
recognizes the numbers on the number plate and can fetch the contact details of the owner 
from the database. It also communicates the same information to the owner with details 
on and extent of tint level violation along with documentary evidence.
Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques are reliable tools for the classification 
and categorization of data. Wearable devices are a relatively recent consumer technology 

x
Preface
that record large amounts of data by measuring signals around the body. Wearables come 
in several forms, such as wristbands, armbands, watches, and headbands. Chapter 2 
explores the use of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to identify individ-
uals and activities using a commercially available wearable headband. It also deals with 
applying machine learning techniques for identifying individuals and their activities that 
are recorded through various wearable devices available in the market. A deep review on 
various algorithms applied for sensor data generated by wearable devices is carried out. 
Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are applied on EEG brain signal data 
for classification. This chapter also discusses challenges involved in handling sensor data 
and its mining.
IoT is a prototypical example of big data. In order to have viable solutions to that effect, 
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are considered to be the right choice. Hence, the IOT 
system with AI techniques makes us to have smart applications like smart e-health, smart 
metering, and smart city to name a few. Although IoT is gaining everybody’s attention 
today, security aspects need to be effectively addressed to prevent an intruder from caus-
ing disastrous consequences. In Chapter 3, the problem of prediction of energy consump-
tion data generated through the smart grid step to connect all power grids for efficient 
energy management is discussed. The system applies convolution neural network and 
addresses the challenges posed by the IoT datasets and is considered to have widespread 
applications in the future digital world. The system is checked against publicly available 
smart city, smart metering, and smart health.
Due to enormous growth in the various applications of IoT, it has the potential to replace 
people as the largest producer and consumer of the Internet. The integration of wireless 
communication, microelectromechanical devices, and Internet has led to the development 
of things in the Internet. It is a network of network objects that can be accessed through 
the Internet, and every object connected will have a unique identifier. The increasing 
number of smart nodes and constant transfer of data are expected to create concerns 
about data standardization, interoperability, security, protection and privacy, and other 
issues. Chapter 4 elaborates on the technical, societal challenges and the impact of IoT 
applications. With the increasing number of smart nodes and constant transfer of data, 
it is expected to create concerns about data standardization, interoperability, security, 
protection, and privacy. This chapter gives a detailed outlook at the issues related to soft-
ware engineering and security in IoT, from which one can provide solutions based on its 
understandings.
The social Internet of things (SIoT) is an emerging topic of the digital era with social, 
economic, and technical significance. The IoT has already proved its dominance in a wide 
range of sectors such as consumer products, durable goods, transportation, industrial 
and utility components, and sensors. It is now extended to social media. The evolution 
of ­powerful social network data analytic capabilities transforms the social livelihood into 
a new era of link prediction, community grouping, recommendation systems, sentiment 
analysis, and more. Chapter 5 covers the evolution of powerful social networking using 
IoT. The present society is digitally progressing toward an ever connected paradigm. It 
explains the basics of IoT and its technological evolution. The popularity of social network-
ing describes the emergence of social network analytics in IoT. This chapter further dis-
cusses various security issues and research challenges pertaining to IoT analytics. It also 
provides information and references for further research and developments in applica-
tions for those in pro-business and pro-people social IoT services.
It has been established that a habitual typing pattern is a behavioral biometric trait in 
biometric science that relates to the issues in user identification/authentication systems.

Preface
Nevertheless, being nonintrusive and cost-effective, keystroke dynamics is a strong alter-
native to other biometric modalities. It can be easily integrated with any other existing 
knowledge-based user authentication system with minor alternation. Obtained accu-
racy in previous studies is impressive but not acceptable in practice due to problems in 
intra-class variation or data acquisition techniques. Chapter 6 deals with the prediction 
of authenticated user depending upon the individual typing pattern. The system aims to 
identify the user through the data generated based on the typing style. It also identifies 
the age, gender, ingenuity, and typing skills. A hybrid fuzzy and rough technique is being 
used and has proved to be effective.
Nanotechnology plays an important role in changing the world through the develop-
ment of new technologies in various fields such as health care, manufacturing, agricul-
ture, and industrial control systems. Recent developments in the Internet of Nano-Things 
(IoNT) are instrumental in the production of new nano devices. In Chapter 7, recent 
trends in nanotechnology are discussed and its roles in various emerging fields are 
presented. This chapter discusses the challenges and opportunities for the Internet of 
Forensic Nano-Things (IoNTF) in assisting and supporting reliable digital forensics in 
the IoNT environment. 
Most devices we use today are equipped with sensors that have the capability of com-
municating and acquiring intelligence. Advancement of such technology supports man-
kind to assist in daily chores. Ambient assisted living (AAL) has drawn attention from 
people who are dependent, aged, and are under care. Chapter 8 focuses on this inter-
esting application of IoT, that is, AAL. AAL systems are IoT-enabled that are exclusively 
designed to assist the aged/senior citizens in their daily activities. This chapter discusses 
various types of sensors used for this purpose and their strengths and weaknesses. It also 
describes various approaches adopted to develop an AAL system. Software engineering–
based model development in AAL will enhance the functionality of the system, which is 
crucial in handling emergencies that older people encounter.
IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, 
objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to 
transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human-to-computer interaction. 
Here, we need to know how the devices or things in IoT are communicating and how 
the name service will translate the meaningful names to machine-understandable form. 
Chapter 9 discusses the role of the naming service and the high-level requirements of the 
name service in IoT. It elaborates on the middleware technology to support device nam-
ing, application addressing, and profile storage and look-up services in IoT environments. 
Challenges of naming services in IoT are discussed along with how naming, address-
ing, and profile server (NAPS) overcomes these challenges. Platform-independent NAPS 
is discussed in detail with its complete design, including its functionalities, system flows, 
interfaces, etc.
Generally, an IoT application focuses on timely service and improves the efficiency. With 
this reason, today many IoT-based healthcare medical devices have been developed to pro-
vide proper treatment for patients in a timely manner. In the medical field, such devices 
have adopted the principle of lightweight protocols to communicate between various IoT-
based medical devices. Chapter 10 provides information about recent technologies to miti-
gate security issues in IoT health care. This chapter discusses various security protocols 
and standards, concentrating on a detailed study of the security issues in communication 
among the devices. It offers a simulated approach and provides solutions to security using 
elliptic curve public key cryptography, which is implemented in a step-by-step manner in 
Contiki network simulator (Cooja) simulator.

Preface
The security issues in many IoT implementations, although already present in the field 
of information technology, offer a lot of unique challenges. It is a fundamental priority to 
address these challenges and ensure that the IoT products and services are secure. Chapter 
11 deals with the challenges involved in handling security issues on IoT data. IoT devices 
are vulnerable to attacks as the systems have a very low level of protection and security. 
In this chapter, several types of intrusions and threats in IoT are discussed. An innovative 
framework to develop a secured system along with authentication is proposed. The col-
laborative learning approach has proven to be an ideal model in recognizing the pattern of 
the intruder, and the system can provide a solution based on it.
Diseases occur because of the interaction of agent, host, and the environment that is 
altogether called the “epidemiological triad.” There are numerous reasons for the failure 
to prevent the complications of diseases. Physicians address only the biomedical part of 
the disease and ignore the other important aspects due to lack of experience and time. This 
need not remain so, provided the science of diseases and the art of healing by physicians 
are embedded in wearable computational devices. Chapter 12 addresses the electronic 
health record maintenance by coupling IoT devices with the system where the medical 
practitioner can view the data on the table. It also emphasizes that IoT is a boon to the 
medical field that saves doctors’ time in handling other necessary calls. Wearable devices 
like fever watches when used on babies will reduce the risk of diseases by regular moni-
toring of the sensor data. The goal of this chapter is to make use of IoT to place health in the 
hands of the patients, which is one of the key principles of primary health care.
Billions of devices are expected to be connected to the Internet in the near future. This 
will provide interoperability among the things on the IoT which is one of the most fun-
damental requirements to support object addressing, tracking, and discovery, as well as 
information representation, storage, and exchange. Defining ontology and using seman-
tic descriptions for data will make it interoperable for users and stakeholders that share 
and use the same ontology. Chapter 13 provides an overview of semantics in IoT-based 
­analytics. This chapter briefs on semantic technology and its specifications and deploy-
ment to develop an application on smart systems.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show the concepts of instabilities that are disturbing 
social communication, interaction, and normal behavior in general. Every autistic child is 
unique in a way.  They face severe problems with emotional balance, communal interactions, 
and communication skills. Such conditions necessitate a high degree of personalization to 
communicate with the outer world. Today, medical science has not been able to trace the 
exact reason for autism, but most therapists have proved that it is unpredictable behavior 
of neurons in human brains. We require a unique set of tools and methodologies to train 
autistic children. It requires enhancing the intensity of awareness about existing and nar-
rowed competence among autism children to discover the way that unaffected children are 
performing. In Chapter 14, classification of the opportunities and trends of IoT applications 
and solutions for autistic children are presented. Also, from an IoT application perspective, 
diversified smart technologies like wearable environmental sensors mobile apps, home 
appliances, and others are discussed. The motivation of this chapter is to discuss the pros-
pect of availability of an IoT support and in availing the services for enhancing the lives of 
autistic children and their supporting families in the society. Also, it helps to teach and train 
autistic children the basic skills and concepts in their day-to-day requirements.
IoT challenges for the future include ubiquitous data collection, potential for unexpected 
use of consumer data, and heightened security risks. So, the current technology needs to be 
improved to enhance privacy and build secure IoT devices by adopting a security-focused 
approach, reducing the amount of data collected by IoT devices, increasing transparency,

1.1  Introduction
In a typical automotive system, such as cars, buses, and lorries, we use glass windows at 
many places. The purpose of the glass window provided at the back side is to provide clear 
visibility of vehicles that are approaching our vehicle. The glass window provided at the 
front side of the car (called windshield) gives a clear view of things ahead of our vehicle. 
The driver moderates the speed of the vehicle according to the objects seen through the 
windshield. At every row of passenger seats, depending on the type of the vehicle, glass 
windows are provided on either side. The purpose of these glass windows is to give vis-
ibility of outside world to the passengers while traveling. During accidents or emergency 
situations, one can even break these windows and escape out of the vehicle. Apart from 
this, a mirror has been provided near the driver seat. Using it, a driver can look at the 
approaching vehicle(s) and also roughly estimate their speed which in turn will help him 
to take proper decisions on how to maneuver the steering wheel and avoid accidents.
The law enforcement authorities such as police personnel can look through these glass 
windows from outside and find out who are all traveling inside the vehicle. This kind of 
tracking is normally done by police personnel whenever some untoward incident such 
as accident or bomb explosion happens. In many such untoward incidents, typically the 
criminals/extremists escape in the vehicles to remote locations. Then, the police personnel

are forced to track all vehicles at many strategic locations to identify or find where the 
criminals are. This kind of tracking is possible only if the police personnel are able to see 
the driver/passengers who are traveling in a vehicle from outside.
For seamless visual tracking of passengers traveling in a vehicle, the visual light trans-
mission (VLT) and visual light reflectance (VLR) values of the glass windows used in the 
vehicle should be at a particular value. All vehicle manufacturers follow certain standards. 
But the vehicle owner/user generally buys window tinting films from grey market and 
pastes the same on the glass windows which in turn will hamper the visibility, thereby 
preventing the law enforcement authorities from having the clear vision of those traveling 
in the vehicle. In many cases, the tinting films are such that the passengers traveling inside 
the vehicle can clearly see the outside world through the glass window while the outsid-
ers may not be able to see who are all inside the vehicle. To regulate this, law enforcement 
authorities in each country/state have prescribed certain threshold values on the VLT/VRT 
value to be used after fixing the tinted films on the glass window.
In this chapter, we propose a video-based automatic technique that will not only ­identify 
the vehicle (say, car) but also estimate the VLT percentage. If the VLT level is below the 
prescribed limit (say, 35%) then the envisaged system will automatically identify the vehi-
cle number plate. Then the identified vehicle registration number will be searched in the 
appropriate database to locate the violator’s contact details. Subsequently, an automatic 
message will be transmitted to the concerned person along with the date, time, and place 
of violation. Thanks to IoT (Internet of Things), the proposed system not only identifies 
the tint level violation but also provides documentary evidence and communicates the 
same to the relevant person.
1.2  Literature Survey
“Window tinting” refers to the methods used to block certain levels of light from pass-
ing through the glass window of vehicles. Most of the window glasses in the vehicles are 
coated or treated in order to filter the harmful ultra-violet (UV) rays entering the vehicle. 
The window tinting has various other effects. (1) Dark tinting will reduce driver’s vision, 
particularly while driving at night. (2) Tinting windows will distort the vision of aged 
people and people with problems with eye sight. (3) If anyone wears polarized sunglasses, 
it will produce some visual patterns on the window. (4) Over a period of time, tinting can 
even lead to bubbles, peel, or develop cracks that may bring down the value of a vehicle 
and it general look. (5) Many vehicles come with window glasses that are engineered in 
such a way that in the event of an accident, they will “break away.” At times, the tinting 
material will prevent windows from breaking during accidents. This in turn can cause or 
even worsen injuries during accidents.
Computing systems are generally introduced wherever speed and accuracy is needed. 
A typical computing system works on the principle of input–process–output. In the con-
ventional computing system, the input is keyed in by human beings (as we see in many 
reservation counters, banks, etc.) and the software algorithm running at the computing 
system processes the inputted data and produces an output. In general, these outputs 
are displayed on a display device such as a monitor or printed using a printer. If people 
responsible are lethargic or lazy, often the speed and accuracy of the computing system is 
lost. However, IoT systems help us to resolve this issue.

IoT-Enabled Vision System for Detection of Tint Level
In the case of an IoT system, the inputs are replaced by relevant sensor(s). Hence, the 
possibility of human errors can be eliminated to a great extent. Whenever we use a vision-
based IoT system, the camera acts as an input sensor. Unlike a computing system, the 
processing application is located at a central server (or cloud system) in the case of an IoT 
system. In many IoT systems, the sensors forward their data to a local computing system 
via short-range wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, and WiFi. 
The local computing system preprocesses it and sends it to a central server (cloud) at regu-
lar intervals using long-range wireless communication protocols such as SMS, 2G, 3G, 4G, 
and WiMax. The central server (cloud) software collates the data and takes some informed 
decision (generally using analytics) and sends it back to the local server/end user. But 
in the case of an IoT system, one uses an actuator (controlling a valve) or an event driver 
notification system (such as an SMS/e-mail alert in a mobile phone). Thus, an IoT system 
uses sensor–processor–actuator principle. This can bring in next level of automation in 
many industries. The important challenge in IoT is designing proper sensors, actuators, 
and interfacing with wireless communication protocols. In general, the data handled by 
the servers are unstructured.
Thus, a typical IoT-enabled system consists of sensors, embedded system, (wireless) 
communication, data storage via Internet into a cloud server, an analytics software 
system to take informed decisions at the cloud platform, and an optional receiver end 
device (mobile). In few cases, the receiver end system will be an actuator that will exe-
cute certain actions on the targeted hardware. We can choose appropriate object(s) (such 
as lockers, curtains, consumer electronics devices such as cookers) and interface it (them) 
with an appropriate sensor(s). The embedded system attached with the object can sense 
the required data and monitor it continuously. At periodic, pre-defined time intervals, 
the necessary data are transfer to a remote location for storage using wired or wire-
less ­communication protocols (such as UDP, TCP/IP, Wi-FI, Bluetooth, ZigBee). The data 
aggregated from various objects are stored in the server, preferably a cloud server. 
At periodic intervals, the aggregated data are analyzed/diagnosed using appropriate 
analytics software running in the server (cloud). The decisions are informed accordingly 
to the end user/system. In most cases, it turns out to be the notification in the mobile 
device or actuation of some subsystems of the end device (such as rotating a fan, opening 
the valve system, switching ON/OFF).
Currently, there are many devices to measure the VLT/VRT values, called tint meters. 
There are two popular types of tint meters available in the market, namely one-piece tint 
meter and two-piece tint meter. The one-piece tint meter is used to check the tint level of 
side (glass) windows. If we use the one-piece tint meter, then one has to request the driver 
of the vehicle to be inspected to stop the vehicle and ask the driver/passenger to roll down 
the (side) windows partially. The tint meter has a slot built in to it (as shown in Figure 1.1). 
One has to insert the partially opened window into this slot and by pressing a button the 
light waves of specific wavelength are transmitted from one side of the tint meter and a 
receiver at the other side of the tint meter will analyze the received light waves. Depending 
on the transmitivity/opacity of the glass along with the black film pasted on it, we get val-
ues ranging from 0% (opaque material such as card board) to 100% (for pure air). Generally, 
the lighter glasses have high transmittance (65% to 80%) and the darker glasses have low 
transmittance (20% to 35%). In many states/countries, the allowed transmittance level is 
35%. If the vehicle’s glass tint level goes below this level, then one can issue a ticket and 
initiate legal action.
In the case of two-piece tint meters, we have two pieces, one back meter and one front 
meter (as shown in Figure 1.2). These kind of tint meters also are used to measure the 

4
Internet of Things (IoT)
tint level of glass windows used at the front side (wind shield) and rear (back) side of the 
vehicle. One can also use them for measuring the tint level of side windows of vehicles. 
The back meter is attached at the back side of the glass. It has a suction cup so that it can 
firmly stick to the glass window. The front meter is attached at the front side of the glass 
to be tested. The magnet helps both the pieces to be held together. By pressing a button, 
we can get the exact light transmittance value.
The main problem in both these types of tint meters is that one has to stop the suspected 
vehicle and carry out the experiment. We would like to design an IoT-enabled vision system 
that can resolve this problem. That means with our proposed system, we can measure the 
light transmittance value of glass windows of vehicles when it is moving. Our approach is 
based on image/video processing techniques. In our proposed method, we first extract 
vehicle windshield region using Gaussian kernel–based background subtraction, histo-
gram equalization, optimal edge detection, and extreme point detection techniques. Then, 
in the detected region, we estimate the tint and transparency level. If the vehicle violates 
the government norms, then we crop the number plate and locate the owner’s communica-
tion address and generate a ticket automatically by attaching the evidence.
1.3  Overview of the Proposed Methodology
Figure 1.3 shows the overview of the proposed windshield tint level detection system 
based on real-time vision. The input to our system is a live video captured through sur-
veillance camera. From the captured video, two frames are extracted; one is the back-
ground image (taken when no vehicle is moving) and another one is the foreground image 
(taken when the vehicle is moving). Both the images have certain common properties such

as image color, image position, image size, image type, and origin. The images are initially 
preprocessed. The preprocessing includes filters, brightness and contrast equivalization, 
and image conversion. Using adaptive background subtraction method, the foreground 
object (moving vehicle) is only extracted. From this processed image, the region of interest 
(ROI), namely windshield/window region, is extracted, and then this ROI is cropped from 
the original color image and is passed on to the tint level calculation module. Three differ-
ent techniques of tint detection were employed in the present work. If the tint level exceeds 
the prescribed limits, then the process switches over to license plate detection to uniquely 
identify the vehicle, and a ticket is issued, if necessary.
Figure 1.4 shows the operational environment of the proposed system in which the cam-
era is placed at a certain height h from the ground level. The height is generally about 8–10 
feet above the ground level so that the windshield/window can be easily visible with 
desirable coverage area that can also easily locate the number plate of the vehicle, if neces-
sary. While capturing the image, the vehicle is in a position such that “r” is the shortest 
distance from the base of the pole on which the camera is mounted on the roadside and 
the front end of the vehicle. Here a and b are the horizontal and vertical components of this 
distance r, respectively. The camera inclination position should generally be not more than 
30° with respect to the windshield/window level so that the internal view of the captured 
image (vehicle internal view) will be good.
Figure 1.5 shows the methodology used for finding the distance of the vehicle from the 
camera which in turn can be used for classifying the vehicle. For this purpose, the ground 
region is segmented into various imaginary grid lines both along x- and y-axes (x1, x2,… 
and y1, y2, y3,…) and is overlaid on the captured image. Assume that the vehicle is present

at the segmented graph location denoted as (x25, y21). Let the length and breadth of each 
block in the segmented graph be fixed. Then, the horizontal component gives the value 
“25 (from x component) * length of block” and the vertical component gives the value of 
“21 (from y component) * breadth of black.” From these horizontal lengths and vertical 
breadths, one can calculate the aspect ratio, to approximately classify the vehicle type. 
Identification of vehicle types is very important in our case. The number of windows and 
location of windows depend on the type of vehicle.
1.4  Implementation Details
Figure 1.6 shows the detailed adaptive background subtraction (ABS) algorithm imple-
mentation. Here, two images, that is, background (Bg) and foreground (Fg) images are 
given as input to the system, and an appropriate filtering algorithm is applied to both the 
images for removing the noises (if any) from the images. Then, the images are converted 
into gray-scale images and their corresponding histograms are equalized for the desired 
background subtraction. The whole process is performed by pixel-by-pixel comparison 
of foreground and background images. If the absolute difference value of the foreground 
image pixel and its corresponding background image pixel is greater than a specified 
threshold value, then it is considered as foreground image and hence it is substituted with 
a high-intensity value (say, 255), else it is substituted with a low-intensity value (say, 0). 
Along with this subtraction process, the updation of background image is also done by 
comparing the foreground and background image pixels. This updation is performed to 
change the background image according to the change in environment. In this compari-
son, if the background image and foreground image intensity of specific location is the 
same, then the background remains same (no updation). Otherwise, if the value of the 
background pixel intensity of a specific location is greater than the value of the foreground 
pixel intensity of the corresponding location, then the background pixel intensity value is 
increased by one, if not the intensity value is decreased by one.
In Figure 1.6, an image “I” consists of a finite set of pixels and our mapping assigns to 
each pixel p = (Px, Py), a pixel value I(p). Consider that the mapping is done in Z2 plane. 
So, in this algorithm, we have two images; one is background image which is represented 
as “Bg” and its intensity value Bg(p) which is mapped in Z2 plane at p = (Px, Py), and the 
FIGURE 1.5

7
IoT-Enabled Vision System for Detection of Tint Level
other is foreground image which is represented as “Fg” and its intensity value Fg(p) is also 
mapped in Z2 plane at p = (Px, Py). The mapping of both images is the same because they 
have the same property.
1.4.1  Noise Removal
Most of the dynamic scenes exhibit persistent motion characteristics. Therefore, in order to 
reduce noise, image must be preprocessed with an appropriate filter. In our case, we used 
Gaussian kernel filter. Gaussian filtering is done by convolving each point in the input 
array with a Gaussian kernel and then summing them all to produce the output array. 
Gaussian kernel for N (N = 1, 2, 3,…) dimension is given by

Here, σ determines the width of the Gaussian kernel. In statistics, when we consider the 
Gaussian probability density function, it is called the standard deviation, and the square 
of it namely, σ2, is called the variance. The normalized Gaussian kernel has an area under 
the curve of unity, that is, as a filter it does not multiply the operand with an accidental 
multiplication factor.
The output of Gaussian filter is converted to a format (image format) which is easy 
to process. For this purpose, we use gray-scale range of shades wherein the darkest 
­possible shade is black, which is the total absence of transmitted or reflected light and 
the lightest possible shade is white, which has the total transmission or reflection of 
light at all visible wavelengths. Intermediate shades of gray are represented by equal

brightness levels of the three primary colors (red, green, and blue) for transmitted 
light, or equal amounts of the three primary pigments (cyan, magenta, and yellow) for 
reflected light.
1.4.2  Adaptive Background Subtraction
After preprocessing, the main task of background subtraction is to find d which is 
defined as d(p) = |Fg(p) − Bg(p)|. Here, Fg refers to foreground image, and Bg refers 
to back ground image. “p” refers to the position of various pixels on the image. Thus, 
d(p) refers to the distance between foreground and background image pixels. This dif-
ference must maintain the value less than the threshold value which is determined by 
the user. We store the d(p) value in a visual pattern which is done by creating a matrix 
of size similar to foreground image which we call as “abs image.” If the d(p) is below 
a definite threshold value, then the “abs” image is padded with lowest intensity value 
and if d(p) goes beyond the definite threshold value, then the “abs” image is padded 
with the highest intensity value. The abs image gives the subtraction of background 
and foreground image. Now we need to change the background image according to 
the change in the environmental or dynamic road condition such as a vehicle. It checks 
the background frame and verifies whether there is any change in the background 
image with respect to the foreground image. If Bg(p) > Fg(p) for the location p, then the 
background intensity Bg(p) is added with some arbitrary value, that is, “Bg(p) + value” 
and if Bg(p) < Fg(p), then Bg(p) is subtracted with the same arbitrary value, that is, 
“Bg(p) – value,” and if Bg(p) = Fg(p), then no change is done on the background image.
Our next intention is to increase the global contrast of foreground and background 
­gray-scale images, especially when the usable data of the image is represented by the 
nearest contrast values. Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed 
on the histogram. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. 
Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent 
intensity values.
1.4.3  Object Detection
The processed image (“abs” image) now contains high-intensity levels (which corre-
sponds to the foreground and background intensity difference) indicating the presence 
of an object (i.e., vehicle). Then, we apply morphological operations on this processed 
image. In a morphological operation, the value of each pixel in the output image is 
based on a comparison of the corresponding pixel in the input image with its neighbors. 
The shape and size of the structural element is used to remove imperfections added 
­during segmentation.
Figure 1.7 shows the auto-cropping algorithm used for obtaining the ROI from the 
chosen input foreground image. The algorithm is performed on the black and white 
images obtained from the background subtraction algorithm, and from this image 
one can identify the pixel location values for cropping the vehicle from the given fore-
ground image. Initially, the size of image is stored in two variables, in which one is 
used to define the row size (say, row) and the other is used to define the column size 
(say, col). Now the variables m and n are set such that they store the starting location, 
namely top left corner of the image [say, p(1,1)] and bottom right corner of the image 
[say, p(row, col)]. We look for the first transition from low to high-intensity value of 
pixels from all sides (top, bottom, left, right) of the image. By scanning the binary image

from top to bottom and from left to right, we locate the extreme points (pixel locations) 
[say, top left pixel (m1, n1), top right pixel (m2, n2), bottom left pixel (m3, n3), and bot-
tom right pixel (m4, n4)]. From these four extreme points, we can find the height and 
breadth of the vehicle which can fit into the rectangular box. Using these parameters 
(pixel extreme locations, length and breadth) on the original color image frame, we can 
crop the vehicle portion alone.
From the ROI, we can find the ratio of height and width of the vehicle which is directly 
related with the width and breadth of image rectangle. From this obtained ratio, the type 
of vehicle is determined such as hatchback or notchback (sedan class). The windscreen/
window area generally changes according to the type of vehicle. For example, in the sedan 
class vehicles, the windscreen location is nearly at the middle whereas in hatchback vehi-
cles, it is slightly at the rear side of the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle tint location can be easily 
obtained for different class of vehicles. Once the vehicle class/type is extracted, then we 
can extract the windshield/window tint area of the vehicle and on this cropped area we 
apply our three basic techniques of tint detection, namely contour detection, histogram 
analysis, and color segmentation.
1.4.4  Tint Level Detection Algorithm
The first technique is color segmentation which identifies different color percentages 
present in the windshield/window area of the extracted image. It is also beneficial to 
identify approximately which color tint is applied on the screen on the basis of color per-
centage of different channels. In the present technique, the three channels of extracted 
area are separated out (i.e., RGB channel). In the separated channel, a specific point is

defined for finding the intensity level in the image. For better accuracy, two or more 
points are identified within the window region and the average intensity of the pixels is 
used. Then, this intensity value is represented by their intensity ­percentage. According 
to the database available for VTL percentage for different environmental conditions, 
the approximate tinting level is determined. Table 1.1 shows the various tinting level on 
green/blue channels and the corresponding RGB level of region in the image.
The second technique used is known as contour detection which improves the tint 
detection of windscreen/window of vehicle. Contours can be explained simply as a 
curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the same color 
or intensity. In this technique, first we find the edges of the image by using relevant 
edge detection technique. After edge detection, the image becomes a function of two 
variables which are curves joining all continuous points, and these curves are called 
contours. These contours are in different numbers depending on the reflection of light 
through windshield/window glass. The number of contours is counted in the given 
image. From the available database (calculated manually) of contour for various inten-
sity levels, the threshold (here is the number of contours) is defined and is used for 
determining the presence or absence of tint. If the number of contours is below the 
specified threshold limit, then the tested windshield/window tinting is not allowed 
according to the norms, and the process will switch to the next module, namely number 
plate detection.
The third technique is called “Histogram analysis” and is used for visually judging 
whether the image is in an appropriate range of gray level. Ideally, digital image should 
use all available gray-scale range, from minimum to maximum. From histogram of tint 
image (final extracted image), we can judge the presence of tinting on windshield/­window. 
If the histogram of the extracted image has only two peaks of gray level, then it has unde-
sired tinting level. If the histogram of the extracted image shows multiple peaks in the 
histogram, then we can conclude that there is desirable level of tinting. These three meth-
ods collectively can determine the tinting level of window/windshield region. Figure 1.8 
shows the flow chart of various tint level detection algorithms used in our present work.
After identifying the tinting level of vehicle window/windshield using these three 
­techniques, the process is switched to number plate identification module. If tinting 
level is more than the desired level (prescribed norms by state/country), then it switches 
to number plate identification module; otherwise, the test ends for the current vehicle. 
After  identifying the license plate registration number of a given vehicle, the system

captures the image of the vehicle for the purpose of proof and saves it in a controller 
(or server). The controller is interfaced with a GPS device which provides the location 
details of the place where the images were captured and appends the system date and 
time. All these ­parameters are sent to the server system which stores all the received data. 
The vehicle registration number is extracted from the captured image and is searched 
in the available database, and the vehicle owner’s contact details are traced for sending 
­evidence to issue a ticket.
1.4.5  License Plate Detection
This is an important stage in vehicle license plate detection in the location of the license 
plate. The license plate area contains a good amount of edge and texture information. 
The license plate of the vehicle consists of several characters, and hence contains rich 
edge information. At times, the background of the vehicle image also contains much 
edge information. The interesting fact is that the background areas around the license 
plate mainly include some horizontal edges whereas the edges in the background 
mainly contain long curves and random noises. Also, the edges in the plate area cluster 
together and produce intense texture feature. If only the vertical edges are extracted 
from the vehicle image and most of the background edges are removed, then the plate

area will be isolated out distinctly. The algorithm proposed in the present work con-
tains four parts: image enhancement, vertical edge extraction, background curve and 
noise removal. 
Figure 1.9 shows the effect on vision due to various tinting levels applied on windows 
and the corresponding darkness value. From Figure 1.9, we could clearly see that when the 
VTL value is less than 35%, it is very difficult to see the objects/persons present inside the 
vehicle. Due to this reason, many law enforcement authorities in various states/countries 
insist that the threshold value of VTL should be 35% or more.
Figure 1.10 shows the design of controller module for further processing. The vehicle under 
surveillance is tested for windshield/window tinting level. If the tinting level is up to the 
desired level, then the testing is continued for the next vehicle; otherwise, for the same vehi-
cle, we switch to number plate identification module. After identifying the “vehicle number” 
of the vehicle, the GPS data or location ID, time, and date along with the proof of tinting level 
(processed image) are sent from the client system (surveillance camera system) to the server. 
The server checks the vehicle registration number in its database and locates the owner’s 
contact details and accordingly issues a ticket to the owner of the vehicle.
1.5  Results and Conclusions
Figure 1.11 shows the various input images which are preprocessed and subtracted 
from background image. Then, the output is given to find the object(s) present in the 
image. Finding its extreme points gives us extracted or segmented image from which 
our main object of interest, namely the window is extracted. For the first set of input 
images, the RGB percentages are 45%, 43.16%, and 44%, respectively, which are greater

than 35% VTL color percentages. For the second set of input images, the RGB percent-
ages are 14%, 16%, and 16%, respectively, which are less than 35% of VTL, and hence 
one can conclude that the dark tinting is present in the windows of those vehicles. The 
various input images given clearly identify and classify the vehicles based on tinting 
levels.
In conclusion, in the present work, we extract the relevant, meaningful images from the 
captured video frames. From the captured images, through motion detection techniques, 
the presence or absence of a vehicle is determined. If a vehicle is present, it is classi-
fied using appropriate imaging techniques. Depending on the type of vehicle, the ROI is 
identified and vehicle image alone is cropped for further processing. Depending on the 
vehicle type, the windshield/window region is identified and that portion of the image 
is used for further processing. Using three different techniques, namely color segmen-
tation, contour detection, and histogram analysis, the tint level of windshield/window 
region is estimated. The tint level on the detected vehicle is verified against the database 
of government permissible limits. If the tint level exceeds government norms, the imag-
ing system extracts the license plate of the vehicle. If the level exceeds the limits of regu-
lation bodies, the controller/processor interfaced with the surveillance system extracts 
the GPS details from the GPS receiver and appends it with date and time. A messaging 
system (such as SMS/MMS/e-mail) interfaced with the surveillance system automatically 
generates an evidence consisting of latitude, longitude, date, time, license/plate image, 
vehicle with tinted window/windshield image for issuing necessary tickets. The messag-
ing system stores the evidence at the central server. At the server side, using the number

1.6  Scope for Future Studies
The proposed tint level detection system has been designed using ordinary cameras 
which work in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In reality, we drive our 
vehicles during early mornings, late evenings, and night times as well. If one wants to use 
the proposed system, then one has to use infrared cameras during those poor lighting con-
ditions. Then, the proposed algorithm needs to be modified. The designed algorithm has 
been tested while the vehicles were moving at low speeds. One has to test the algorithm 
while vehicles are moving at high speeds.

Internet of Things (IoT)
2.1  Introduction
Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques are reliable tools for the classification 
and categorization of data. Wearable devices are a relatively recent consumer technology 
that record large amounts of data by measuring signals around the body. Wearables come 
in many different forms, such as wristbands, armbands, watches, and headbands. This 
chapter explores the use of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to identify 
individuals and activities using a commercially available wearable headband.
Wearable headbands typically measure the electroencephelogram (EEG) signals gener-
ated by the user’s brain from many different locations around the head. Depending on the 
duration of measurement, these signals generate a large stream of values of variable length 
on multiple channels, from multiple locations. It is not easy to use the raw representation 
generated by such devices for meaningful data mining activities. This chapter illustrates 
a method of creating a compact representation of the data streams from multiple channels 
without losing the essence of the patterns within the data.
The data were collected from a commercially available wearable headband, called Muse. 
The Muse headband records EEG signals from four different locations around the head, 
as well as acceleration and some facial movement data. The dataset was created based on 
the recordings of five individuals performing five tasks each; reading, playing computer 
games, relaxing, listening to music, and watching movies. The activities were repeated 
a number of times for each participant. The raw data were converted to the proposed 
knowledge representation for use with the various supervised and unsupervised learning 
techniques.
The viability of the proposed knowledge representation is demonstrated through the 
usage of a number of well-known supervised classification [1] techniques, including decision 
trees [2], support vector machines (SVM) [3], neural networks [4], and random forests [5]. 
The usage of a variety of classification techniques show the summarized frequency distribu-
tion is effective for representing the time series of signals, independent of the classification 
techniques that are used. The classification techniques successfully predicted the persons as 
well as the activities based on the data.
This chapter also explores the usage of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning 
techniques with the proposed data representation. Clustering using the K-means algo-
rithm is one of the most popular unsupervised learning techniques. K-medoids is an 
alternative of K-means that finds an object that is most similar to all the other objects in 
the cluster, as opposed to determining the centroid of the cluster. These methods focus on 
optimizing within cluster scatter and separation between the clusters. Both K-means and 
K-medoids do not provide the capability of incorporating additional optimization crite-
ria. The fact that K-medoids offers a discrete search space, limited by the total number 
of objects in the dataset, can provide advantages for evolutionary searching. By combin-
ing K-medoids with an evolutionary algorithm, it is possible to perform multi-objective 
clustering. Peters [6] first proposed the use of evolutionary computing in the context 
of rough set theory, Lingras [7,8] subsequently explored both K-means and K-medoids 
based on rough set theory.
The K-means and the proposed semi-supervised crisp and rough K-medoid algo-
rithms are compared using the proposed knowledge representation structure. By extend-
ing the evolutionary rough K-medoid algorithm to optimize the precision of the known 
­categorization of signals in the dataset, it is shown that this approach may be effective for 
improving the precision of known category information in some cases.

Identification from Wearable Device Brain Signals
Through comprehensive testing with supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised 
techniques, this chapter shows the viability of the proposed data representation to effec-
tively capture the essence of the large amount of recorded raw data. It is shown that the 
various classification techniques are effective in predicting persons and activities, and that 
various clustering techniques also provide reasonable results.
2.2  Review of Wearables
Wearable technologies are evolving quickly and companies are discovering innovative 
ways to utilize the enormous amount of data they now have access to. There are many 
different categories of wearables. Each category collects its own unique type of data that 
can be used for meaningful data mining activities. This chapter will specifically investigate 
the collection of EEG brain signals [9] from a commercially available wearable, the Muse 
headband.
2.2.1  Wristbands and Watches
Smart watches such as the Pebble or the Apple Watch provide an interface to notifications, 
such as messages, calendar events, or breaking news, that are typically viewed on a smart 
phone. Additionally, as a wearable, they have their own sensors such as GPS, accelerom-
eters, magnetometers, and heart rate sensors. These sensors provide additional capabilities 
for users, who can now track activity levels or health information.
Wristbands, such as Fitbit devices or the Nymi band, provide more specialized function-
ality and typically do not rely on an ongoing connection to a smart phone. The Nymi band, 
for example, measures an individual's ECG to create a unique biometric identifier that can 
be used in place of a traditional password. Fitness trackers such as the Jawbone UP or Fitbit 
devices are wearable wristbands that can measure health and activity information. They 
can record information such as how long and how far the individual has performed a spe-
cific exercise, the duration and quality of their sleep, and heart rate levels. Fitness tracker 
wearables such as the Fitbit devices aim to motivate users and provide feedback through 
the measurements they gather. Fitness trackers often tie in to smart phone or online appli-
cations to better analyze the data they collect, and to provide feedback to users.
2.2.2  Armbands
Armband wearables, such as the Myo, use sensors to monitor the user's gestures and 
movements. The Myo, for example, uses electromyography sensors to detect the electrical 
activity changes as the user activates different muscles and combines the EMG input with 
gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer sensors.
2.2.3  Headbands, Headsets, and Smartglasses
Head mounted wearables in general either augment the wearer’s capabilities by display-
ing additional information through a heads up display, such as in the case of Google Glass 
or the Microsoft HoloLens, or use sensors to measure the wearer’s brain activity, such as 
the Emotiv and Muse headbands.

20
Internet of Things (IoT)
The Google Glass headset provides a display and sensors to show the information found 
on a smart watch or smartphone. Additionally, a camera in the device can be used not 
only for taking pictures but also for computer vision tasks such as object recognition or, in 
combination with the display, augmented reality where computer-generated graphics are 
displayed as an overlay to highlight objects in the real world. Other headsets, such as the 
Microsoft HoloLens, are expected to provide a similar augmented reality experience, serv-
ing as a way to improve both creation and consumption of multimedia. The HoloLens also 
promises to improve interactions with real-world objects, such as providing step-by-step 
instructions on repairing a light switch.
Headbands such as Muse or Emotiv provide brain–computer interfaces (BCI). The Muse 
headband uses four EEG sensors, two on the forehead and two behind the ears, and three 
additional reference sensors. Muse can also record blinking and jaw clenching. These sen-
sors are used to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain. Currently, the Muse 
headband is targeted as a mindfulness training device, helping users calm their minds. 
However, developers have used the device as a BCI to control robots and perform research. 
Similarly, the Emotiv makes use of even more EEG channels, accelerometer sensors, mag-
netometers, and gyroscope sensors to detect a wide variety of facial expressions, emotional 
states, and mental commands, such as push, pull, left, or right.
2.2.4  e-Textiles: Smart Clothing, Smart Textiles, Smart Fabrics
e-Textiles comprise various clothing and fabrics with integrated electronics that allow them 
to communicate, measure, and transform. Smart clothing, such as the smart shirts, devel-
oped by OMsignal and Hexoskin, provides in-depth biometric measurements, including 
heart rate, breathing rate, step counts, calorie counts, and more. The smart clothing is used 
by athletes to improve training and athletic performance, and by researchers to research 
sleep patterns, stress levels, respiratory ability, and air pollution.
Smart fabrics such as Smart Skin, while currently is not wearable by humans, is used for 
products on packaging lines to measure various factors such as pressure and orientation to 
provide higher levels of quality assurance.
2.3  Review of Supervised Learning 
In this chapter, we compare the results of many classification and clustering algorithms. 
A brief overview of the algorithms used in this study is provided below.
2.3.1  Decision Tree 
The objective of a decision tree algorithm is to determine the rules that can be used to 
classify an instance based on the value of the instance’s attributes [2]. The possible combi-
nation of rules includes all partitions that can be obtained from the process of recursively 
splitting the data [10], which may include multiple splits on the same attribute [10].
To determine the optimal attribute for splitting and the corresponding cut-point value, 
impurity reduction is used. The impurity in each node is calculated with entropy mea-
sures, such as the Gini Index or the Shannon Entropy [10]. Impurity reduction is measured 
as the difference between the impurity value for the parent node and the ­average impurity 
value for the child nodes.

21
Identification from Wearable Device Brain Signals
The stopping criteria for the recursive decision tree algorithm is commonly a threshold 
for the minimum number of remaining instances in a node’s partition or a threshold for 
the minimum difference in impurity calculated between the parent and child nodes [10]. 
Overfitting occurs when a classification model performs well when tested against training 
data but poorly when applied to unseen data. Tree pruning techniques [10,11] and statisti-
cal stopping criteria [10] have been used to mitigate overfitting.
2.3.2  Random Forest
The random forest technique, proposed by Breiman (2001), leverages multiple decision 
trees to predict an outcome [12, 34]. Its output is determined by the prediction that appears 
the most often in each of the individual decision trees [10,12]. Multiple trees, or an ensem-
ble of trees, can be used to mitigate the instability of a single decision tree [10]. An ensem-
ble of trees is created with random samples picked from the input training data [10,11]. 
The instances excluded with each random sample can be considered “out-of-bag” and 
used as test samples for measuring out-of-bag prediction accuracy.
Tree ensembles minimize overfitting with a set of diverse trees that tend to converge 
when the set is sufficiently large [12]. By randomly restricting the attributes used to gen-
erate the trees, attributes that would otherwise not have been chosen in a single decision 
tree can result in the discovery of cross-attribute correlations and patterns that otherwise 
would have been missed [10]. This has the potential to improve global prediction and 
accuracy.
2.3.3  Support Vector Machine
Support vector machine is used for binary classification [3,13–15]. The attributes of input 
training data are referred to as features. SVM works by first mapping the input data into 
a higher dimensional feature space. The SVM model then works to produce an optimal 
hyperplane in the new high dimensional feature space. The hyperplane separates the data 
into two groups, representing the two classes of the input data. In a two-dimensional space, 
we can separate instances into two groups with a line. In a higher dimensional space, we 
use hyperplanes. An optimal hyperplane maximizes the margin, or separation, between 
the two groups. The dataset used in this chapter has more than two classes. There are five 
classes of activities and four classes representing the persons. Since SVM are explicitly 
designed to classify into two groups, a specialized approach is required to handle multiple 
classes in the classification dataset, referred to as multiclass classification.
The implementation of SVM used in this chapter used the “one-against one” or “one-
versus-one” approach for multiclass classification [16]. For k classes, there are k k −
(

binary classifiers trained, and then a voting scheme decides the appropriate single class 
predicted [13,16]. Each binary classifier is given a newly constructed training dataset, such 
that one class is considered the positive class and another class is considered the negative 
class [13]. Finally, each of the binary classifiers can vote on the single class that they predict 
is correct, and the class with the most votes is considered the combined prediction. 
2.3.4  Neural Network
Artificial neural networks, used for information processing, are inspired by the interac-
tions within the biological nervous system of the human brain [17]. Neurons are connected 

22
Internet of Things (IoT)
and communicate to each other through synapses, dendrites, and axons. The dendrites 
of a neuron act as a set of inputs while, in contrast, the axon acts as the neuron’s output. 
The synapse is a junction that bridges the communication between one neuron’s output, 
the axon, and another neuron’s input, the dendrites.
Artificial neural networks work by mimicking these biological processes, using a 
network of artificial neurons. The neurons are based on their input variables and their 
assigned weights. The weight corresponds to the strength of the synapse in the network. 
If the input values meet the required level to fire, the neuron will pass on an output value 
to the next set of neurons. This process repeats until the final neuron is fired upon and 
outputs the classification. Both biological and artificial neural networks learn by chang-
ing their weight values, which is the strength of the synapses in biological networks [17]. 
For ­supervised learning, the back propagation algorithm is used to quickly train artifi-
cial neural networks and adjust the weights to minimize the error between predicted and 
desired outputs [17,18].
2.4  Semi-Supervised Learning with Genetic 
Algorithms and Rough Set Theory 
2.4.1  K-means Clustering
The K-means algorithm is provided with the number of clusters k to find, which also 
determines the number of centroids used [19]. A centroid is the average position of all the 
points within the cluster. The K-means algorithm starts with random centroids as initial 
guesses, and then determines the optimal and stable centroids for the clusters through 
subsequent iterations.
The k initial centroids can be selected randomly from the dataset, or created as ran-
dom locations, within the input space. Each of the input data instances are then assigned 
to the closest centroid. The closest centroid is determined by a distance metric, such as 
Euclidian distance. After each instance has been assigned to a centroid, a new centroid for 
each ­cluster is calculated as the average of all of the instances assigned to it.
This process is repeated and the entire dataset is reassigned to the new centroids. 
The  ­algorithm will repeat until the cluster centroids do not change with subsequent 
­iterations [19].
2.4.2  Adaptation of Rough Set Theory for Clustering
Rough set theory represents a set of both lower and upper approximations instead of the 
traditional nonoverlapping sets. In conventional nonoverlapping sets, the boundaries of 
the sets or clusters are not always clearly defined, and objects may be equidistant from the 
center of multiple clusters. In contrast, rough sets are more flexible because they allow over-
lapping clusters and are also less descriptive (specific) than fuzzy sets. The lower approxi-
mation of a rough set is a set comprising only the elements that definitely belong to the 
subset. Objects in this set are located in the positive region. The upper approximation of a 
rough set comprises elements that both definitely belong, and those that possibly belong to 
the subset. The lower approximation is a subset of the upper approximation. Elements that 
are outside the upper approximation are located in the negative region, whereas elements

in the outer approximation, but not in the lower approximation, are located in the bound-
ary region. Let U be a set of objects. Rough sets were originally proposed using equiva-
lence relations on U. However, it is possible to define a pair of lower and upper bounds

 as long as the properties specified by 
Pawlak [20,21] are satisfied. Yao [22] described various generalizations of rough sets by 
relaxing the assumptions of an underlying equivalence relation. Such a trend toward gen-
eralization is also evident in rough mereology proposed by Polkowski [23], and the use 
of information granules in a distributed environment by Skowron [24]. The present study 
uses a generalized view of rough sets. If one adopts a more restrictive view of rough set 
theory, the rough sets developed in this chapter may have to be looked upon as interval 
sets [25]. Let us consider a hypothetical clustering scheme

that partitions the set U based on an equivalence relation P. Let us assume that due to 
insufficient knowledge, it is not possible to precisely describe the sets, Ci,1 ≤ i ≤k, in the 
­partition. However, it is possible to define each set C

We are considering the upper and lower bounds of only a few subsets of U. Therefore, it 
is not possible to verify all the properties of the rough sets [20,21]. However, the family of

 are required to follow some of the basic rough set 
properties such as:

Property (P1) emphasizes the fact that a lower bound is included in a set. If two sets are 
mutually exclusive, their lower bounds should not overlap. Property (P2) confirms the 
fact that the lower bound is contained in the upper bound. Property (P3) is applicable to 
the objects in the boundary regions, which are defined as the differences between upper 
and lower bounds. The exact membership of objects in the boundary region is ambiguous. 
Therefore, property (P3) states that cannot belong to only a single boundary region. Note 
that (P1) – (P3) are not necessarily independent or complete. However, enumerating them 
will be helpful in understanding the rough set adaptation of evolutionary, neural, and 
statistical clustering methods.
2.4.3  Genetic Algorithms
A genetic algorithm is a search process that follows the principles of evolution through 
natural selection. The domain knowledge is represented using a candidate solution 

24

called an organism. Typically, an organism is a single genome represented as a vector 
of length n:

(2.2)
where ci is called a gene.
An abstract view of a generational genetic algorithm (GA) is given in Figure 2.1. A group 
of organisms is called a population. Successive populations are called generations. A genera-
tional GA starts from initial generation G(0), and for each generation G(t), generates a new 
generation G(t + 1) using genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. The mutation 
operator creates new genomes by changing values of one or more genes at random. The cross-
over operator joins segments of two or more genomes to generate a new genome. The process 
is repeated until a specified stopping criterion has been met, as described in Figure 2.1.
2.4.4  Genetic Algorithms for Rough K-Medoid Clustering
This section describes a variation of the evolutionary rough K-means approach proposed 
by Lingras [7]. The proposal replaces K-means with K-medoids. A medoid is the most cen-
trally located object in a given cluster. For k clusters, we will have K-medoids. A genetic 
algorithm can be used to search for the most appropriate K-medoids. The genome will 
contain k genes, each corresponding to a medoid. This reduces the size of a genome from 
km by a factor of m to k. The smaller genomes will reduce the space requirements and 
facilitate faster convergence. The genes in the rough K-means algorithm were continuous 
real variables with no restriction on their values. The values of genes for the medoids will 
be discrete and limited to the number of objects in the dataset. If we number the objects 
from 1,…,n, then each gene can take an integer value in the range 1,…,n. This restric-
tion on the values of genes will further reduce the search space allowing for even faster 
convergence.
The next step in the development of a rough K-medoid algorithm is to assign an object 
to lower and/or upper bound of one of the clusters. The process is similar to the rough

It should be emphasized that the approximation space A is not defined based on any 
­predefined relation on the set of objects. The lower and upper bounds are constructed 
based on the criteria described above.
The next step in calculating the fitness of a genome is to measure the validity of a clus-
tering scheme. We will use one of the most intuitive distance-based validity measures. 
The  measure will accumulate the distances of the objects assigned to a cluster and its 
medoid as determined by the GAs:

The rough error described above is based on the distances between patterns. However, 
we know the categorization of the patterns based on activity and the person performing 
the activity. In this experiment, we will focus on the categorization of the data based on 
the person. We first need to make a correspondence between a cluster and the most pre-
dominant class in the upper bound of that cluster. We then count the number of correctly 
classified patterns. The error in classification will be the number of incorrectly classified 
patterns, wrongClasses. We then take a weighted combination of ∆rough and wrongClasses:

2.5  Study Data
The Muse headband is a commercially available wearable product for consumer use. 
The usage of a commercial product in this study leaves the decisions for sensor selection 
and positioning to the device manufacturer. The Muse headband uses four sensors, two 
located on the forehead, and two behind the ears. Three additional sensors on the forehead 
are used as reference sensors by the device. Although the Muse API also provides access 
to the signals for muscle movement and accelerometer data, our research focused on the 
EEG data. Muse provides this data in a variety of formats. At the lowest level, the analog 
microvolt signals are recorded by the four sensors which, by default, are sampled at a rate of 
220 Hz. These EEG signals are then compressed in order to stream the data over Bluetooth. 
The signals are compressed via Golomb Encoding and further quantized to reduce their 
size. Full details on Muse’s compression algorithm are available via their online manual 
[26]. Muse offers both absolute band powers and relative band powers. The absolute band 
power is computed as the logarithm of the sum of the power spectral data of the EEG over 
the specified frequency range (alpha, beta, delta, gamma, theta). The power spectral density 
is computed via fast fourier transform on the device. The relative band powers normalize 
the absolute band powers as a percentage of the total absolute band powers [27], resulting 
in values between 0 and 1. This is calculated by:

where sr is the relative frequency range (alpha, beta, delta, gamma, or theta) being calcu-
lated and Sabs is the frequency range’s absolute value.
It was assumed that the signals will be able to help us extract signature patterns for indi-
vidual users as well as various activities. Five individuals participated in the original data 
collection programs. These individuals worked very closely with each other and used simi-
lar setups for data collection. Five activities that represent day-to-day functions performed 
by most people were identified as a proof of concept. These activities were as follows:
	
1.	Reading: A user read a magazine for 1–3 minutes.
	
2.	Doing nothing: A user sat quietly for 1–3 minutes.
www.ebook3000.com

27
Identification from Wearable Device Brain Signals
	
3.	Watching video: A user watched a video for 1–3 minutes.
	
4.	Game playing: A user played a computer game for 1–3 minutes.
	
5.	Listening to music: A user listened to music for 1–3 minutes.
The above activities were repeated 10 times for five individuals resulting in a total of 50 
datasets.
2.6  Knowledge Representation
One of the key aspects of any data mining activity is representing real-world entities 
using the pertinent numeric data available for them. In our case, we want to capture 
individuals and their activities using the signals emanating from their brain. This 
chapter focuses on summarizing, and not manipulating, the signals collected from the 
wearable into a fixed-length representation. As mentioned before, the Muse headband 
collects data from four positions around the head. Each position provides five types 
of waves: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta. That means at any given point in time, 
we receive a record with 20 values. There will be a stream of these 20-valued records 
that will be recorded at a discrete time interval of 0.1 seconds. That means if we record 
activity for one person for one minute we will have a total of 600 records. Realistically, 
if we are recording an activity for a person, we cannot put an exact time limit on each 
person. In our experiment, the recording time per activity ranged anywhere from 60 to 
180 seconds.
Table 2.1 shows the summary statistics for all the five waves: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, 
and theta for each of the four locations for all the participants. It can be seen that the val-
ues for each type of wave have similar ranges in all locations. However, the frequency 
range for different waves varies considerably. For example, the absolute frequency range 
of alpha values is from 7.5 Hz to 13 Hz, while beta values range from 13 Hz to 30 Hz [27]. 
In our dataset, we used Muse’s relative band powers, which normalize the absolute band 
powers as a percentage of the total absolute band powers. This resulted in alpha values 
ranging from 0.00 to 0.98, while beta values range from 0.00 to 0.95, as shown in Table 2.1. 
Using the relative band powers decreased the variability of the value ranges; however, 
our collected data still had slight variations in the range for each wave. Therefore, we 
normalized the values for each wave using 90% of the maximum value for that wave, as 
shown in Equation 2.10. That made sure that the values for all the waves were in the same 
range. For instance, the value of wavemaximum would be 0:98 for an alpha value, denoted by 
valuerelative, determined using relative band powers.

Another issue with the data collection was the variable length of time for different 
activities as well as the length of each record. The length of the record could vary any-
where from 60 to 180 seconds. Figure 2.2 shows an example of one of the waves, alpha, 
from position 3 while player 1 was playing a game for 60 seconds. In order to fix the 
length of the record to a fixed and more manageable value, we studied the frequency dis-
tribution of the records. After experimenting with different number of bins, we decided

to use 5%, 15%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 85%, and 95% values to represent the histogram. Here 
if x is 5% value, it means that 5% of the values will be less than or equal to x. Figure 2.3 
shows the histogram of values for the wave shown in Figure 2.2. As we can see, the rep-
resentation consists of only eight values and captures the essence of each wave, position, 
and person in a concise and consistent manner. Since we have a total of four positions, 
five waves, and eight histogram bins, we have a total of 4*5*8 = 160 values to represent 
each record of an activity. For five persons and five activities, this process was planned 
to be repeated 10 times, giving a total of 5*5*10 = 250 records. For reasons detailed below, 
the results presented in this chapter only used 178 of the 250 records. We will use these 
records to train classification models to predict the person as well as the activity based 
on a recording from the Muse headband.
2.7  Experimental Design
2.7.1  Data
There were five individuals involved in the data collection. There were 5 records collected 
for one of the individuals, 23 records for another individual, and the remaining individu-
als had 50 or more records. The individual with five records tended to get neglected by the 
classifiers in favor of individuals with a larger number of records. Therefore, in the initial 
experiments reported in this chapter, we have used data from four individuals. Individual 
0 had 23 records, individuals 1 and 2 had 50 records each, and individual 3 had 55 records, 
resulting in a total of 178 records.

2.7.2  Classification
The dataset used to develop the classification models therefore consists of 178 records. 
Each record contains 160 attributes. We used the following four well-known classifiers:
	
1.	Decision tree
	
2.	Random forest
	
3.	Support vector machines
	
4.	Neural networks
The classifiers were trained using default parameters and options. Each classifier was 
applied to three predictions:
	
1.	Predicting a person—Five classes corresponding to five persons
	
2.	Predicting an activity—Five classes corresponding to five activities
•	 Doing nothing
•	 Playing a game
•	 Listening to music
•	 Watching a video
•	 Reading
	
3.	Predicting a person as well as the activity—Twenty-five classes corresponding to 
the cross-product of the set of persons and the set of activities.
To test how well our knowledge representation and classifiers describe the activities, 
we first applied the classifiers to the entire dataset. This allowed us to study the impor-
tance of different attributes in the classification process.
In Tables 2.4(a), 2.4(b), and 2.5, you can see the most significant independent variables 
obtained by the random forest classifier when classifying by person, activity, or person and 
activity, respectively. 
 Using a complete dataset for training can lead to overtraining of the classifiers. The clas-
sifier may not work for new datasets. In order to see if the models were general enough to 
predict new recordings, we applied ten fold cross-validation.
In ten fold cross-validation [28], 10% of randomly selected data from the dataset is set 
aside for testing the model. The remaining 90% of the dataset is used for training the model. 
This process is repeated 10 times and the results are summarized.
From our tests we learned that our knowledge representation paired with SVM, ­random 
forest, or neural networks could predict a class for person or activity with fairly high 
­precision. However, using a decision tree classifier proved to be ineffective.
The primary objective of the study was to explore the effectiveness of a number of well-
known classification techniques combined with a data representation that reduces variable 
length signals to more manageable and uniformly fixed-length distributions. Using this rep-
resentation and the classification techniques, the hypothesis was that the EEG brain signals 
will be identifiable for both persons and activities with a reasonable degree of precision.
2.7.3  Semi-Supervised Evolutionary Learning
We used the two-point crossover technique for the genetic algorithm. The two-point 
­crossover technique uses two points to divide both of the parents’ genomes into three

partial genomes. The children genomes are generated by swapping the middle partial 
genome, between the two points, of the parents’ genomes [29].
The parameters for rough clustering were set as follows: threshold = 1.1, wu = 0.7; wl = 0.3. For 
multi-objective optimization, the weight for distance-based optimization wd was set at 0.75, 
and the weight for classification wc was equal to 0.25. Since the assignment of patterns to clus-
ters is based on distance measure, the distance tended to influence the optimization more 
than the wrong classification. Therefore, the evolutionary semi-supervised crisp and rough 
clustering was run multiple times and solutions that provided the best ­classifications were 
chosen. These multiple runs also allowed us to steer out of locally ­optimal solutions.
The primary objective of this experiment was to explore the effectiveness of Euclidean 
distance between brain signals to identify an individual person. The hypothesis was that 
signals from an individual will be similar and belong to the same cluster. The hypothesis 
can be tested with the well-known K-means clustering algorithm. The K-means cluster-
ing algorithm was selected because of its simplicity. Furthermore, the study explored the 
possibility of influencing the clustering with the known categorization using evolutionary 
crisp and rough K-medoid algorithms. We used confusion matrices for detailed analysis 
and the precision of clustering in identifying the individuals as two evaluation measures.
2.8  Classification Results
Tables 2.2 and 2.3 show the precision [30,31] of prediction for two of the classifiers, SVM 
and random forest, respectively. For each classifier, Tables 2.2 and 2.3 report the accuracy 
for predicting the activity, person, or both. The results include training for the entire ­dataset 
as well as by ten fold cross-validation.

Our tests from training on the entire dataset showed SVM and random forest were able 
to successfully predict a class for person, activity, or person and activity with 100% preci-
sion. Furthermore, neural networks were also able to predict person with 100% and activ-
ity with 95% accuracy, although it did not perform well for predicting person and activity 
together. Overfitting was most prominent for predicting activity; however, the precision 
values remained fairly high after switching to using ten fold cross-validation.
Precision tells us the likelihood of the classifier being correct when predicting a class. 
Precision can be calculated by dividing the diagonal value in a row by the sum of the row 
of a confusion matrix [32]. The precision values for ten fold cross-validation are all above 
92% for predicting the person with SVM, neural networks, or random forest. In compari-
son, the precision values for the decision tree classifiers showed that they do not perform 
well using our knowledge representation of the EEG data and at best only achieve a preci-
sion of 65%.
Tables 2.4(a), 2.4(b), and 2.5 show the top five significant variables obtained by the 
­random forest classifier when classifying by person, activity, or person and activity, 
­respectively. The variable names include the bin number, wave, and location. For example, 
bin 7 (85% to 95%) of the theta wave at location 4 would be named “B7.Theta.4.”
The most significant independent variable for predicting a person, activity, or person 
and activity was bin 1 (0% to 5%) of beta wave at location 1 with a significance score of 
25%, bin 1 (0% to 5%) of theta wave at location 2 with a significance score of 6%, and bin 7 
(85% to 95%) of theta wave at location 4 with a significance score of 6%, respectively. The 
theta wave at location 2 is significant for predicting person or activity with a significance 
score of 8% and 6%, respectively.
Figure 2.4 shows a graphical representation of the decision tree classifier that helps us 
understand the logical process of the person classification. Notice individual 0, with only 
23 records instead of 50 records, is not included in the decision tree. This demonstrates that 
individuals with fewer records were neglected.

classes was based on the most dominant class in a given cluster. It is clear that cluster 1 
matches class 1 reasonably well. Similarly, cluster 3 matches class 3 reasonably well. Most 
members of cluster 2 are from class 2. Cluster 0 is a little difficult to match with a class. 
Most of the members from class 0 belong to cluster 0. However, the most dominant class in 
cluster 0 is class 2. Since we had already assigned another cluster to class 2, we associated 
cluster 0 with class 0. This assignment leads to the precision, recall, and F-measure values 
are shown in Figure 2.5.
 With K-means clustering, our precision is quite high for persons 1 and 3. However, the 
value is very low for person 0 and middling for person 2. The likelihood of us classifying

a given person in the correct cluster is given by recall. Recall is calculated by the diagonal 
value for a column and the sum of the column. Recall of K-means for person 1 is reason-
ably high, fair for person 0, but low for person 2 and 3. F-measure is the harmonic mean of 
precision and recall. F-measure is calculated as:

Table 2.10 shows the confusion matrix resulting from the evolutionary semi-super-
vised K-medoids clustering. As before, we matched the clusters and classes based on the 
most dominant class in a given cluster. This assignment leads to the precision, recall, and 
F-measure values shown in Figure 2.6. In comparison to the precision, recall, and F-measure 
values from K-means shown in Figure 2.5, the evolutionary semi-supervised K-medoids 
provide more reasonable values. All the precision, recall, and F-measure values are above 
65%, as opposed to the 40% and 45% values seen for recall of person 2 and 3, respectively, 
with K-means clustering.
Since rough clustering provides upper and lower bounds of clustering, we analyze them 
separately. It should be noted that the lower bounds are exclusive. A pattern belongs to 
a lower bound when we are almost certain of its membership. The upper bound, on the 
contrary, is inclusive. If there is a reasonable chance that a pattern may belong to a class, 
we assign it to the upper bound of the class.

Table 2.11(a) shows the confusion matrix of upper bounds resulting from the evolution-
ary semi-supervised rough K-medoids clustering. As before, we matched the clusters and 
classes based on the most dominant class in a given cluster. The cluster and class matching 
from the lower bounds was used to create the confusion matrix shown in Table 2.11(b). 
The precision values for the lower and upper bounds are shown in Figure 2.7. Since the 
boundary region represents ambivalence and has a higher likelihood of containing the 
wrong classes, the precision of the upper bounds is seen to be lower than the correspond-
ing K-medoids clustering. On the contrary, the precision of the lower bounds reached as 
high as 100% for person 0, and 88% for person 1, higher than previous methods. However, 
the precision for person 3 was the worst of all methods, with no correct matches. The higher 
precision of the lower bound is due to its exclusive nature, while the inclusive nature of the 
upper bound leads to generally lower precision.
The calculations of recall for the rough clustering shown in Figure 2.7 cannot use the 
sum of the columns because of the overlap between the upper bound clusters. Instead, we

provides us with higher recall values. On the contrary, the exclusivity of lower bounds 
leads to lower recall values.
2.10  Conclusion
Wearable technology provides exciting opportunities for data mining. This study demon-
strates the viability of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques 
for identifying individuals and activities based on EEG data collected from a commercially 
available wearable headband. In a real-world scenario, the signals will have even more vari-
ation in length than what has been evaluated here. Most data mining techniques are based 
on fixed-length object representation. This chapter shows that by using histograms of EEG 
brain signals, we can apply a wide variety of data mining techniques. Histograms are very 
advantageous as they reduce the raw variable length data to fixed-length representations. 
No matter the length of the data recorded, the representation will be the same.
All four supervised learning techniques explored were successful in identifying persons 
based on their collected EEG brain signals. The ten fold cross-validation results varied 
from 95% to 93% for SVM, neural networks, and random forest. Decision tree provided 
the least precision with 65%. SVM’s precision of 78% for activities and 85% for person and 
activity showed that the proposed representation is quite credible for predicting activi-
ties from brain signals as well. Optimizing and tuning the classifier parameters may yield 
increased accuracy and precision; however, that was not explored in this chapter.
The traditional clustering methods had precision values ranging from 27% to 82% 
for K-means, and improved values of 68% to 95% for K-medoids. The proposed rough 
K-medoids evolutionary clustering method provided varying results. The precision of the 
lower bounds had a very large range, from 0% to 100%. Recall values were lower overall 
for K-means, with a range of 40% to 98%, as compared to K-medoids, with a range of 65% 
to 96%. For the proposed rough K-medoids algorithm, the recall for the upper bound was 
overall higher, but with a wide range from 13% to 100%.
The proposed rough K-medoids algorithm provided widely varying results depending 
on the person. This is demonstrated by the 0% recall and precision values for person 3 and 
the 100% precision value for person 0 in the lower bound. Correspondingly, in the upper 
bound, the variation is demonstrated by the 6% precision and 13% recall for person 0 and 
the 100% recall for person 1. With rough clustering, the upper bounds are inclusive in 
nature. If a pattern has reasonable chance of belonging to a cluster, it goes into its upper 
bound. This leads to generally higher recall values. The lower bounds, on the contrary, 
are exclusive. A pattern goes into the lower bound of a cluster only if there is a very high 
chance that the pattern belongs to the cluster. This leads to lower recall and higher preci-
sion values for the lower bounds of clustering. An analyst can use the upper bounds of a 
cluster when higher recall is desired. Lower bounds of the clusters will be useful when the 
precision is an overwhelming criterion.
All clustering methods were reasonably successful with matching clusters to persons. 
K-medoids provided the most reliable results, while the proposed rough K-medoids algo-
rithm had both very good and very poor results. This suggests that further optimization 
and tuning of the algorithm may be necessary.

Internet of Things (IoT)
3.1  Introduction
With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), it has now become a buzzword for 
everyone who works in this area of research. Further, it is seen that with the rapid devel-
opment of sensors and devices with their connection to IoT become a treasure trove for 
big data analytics. It has found numerous applications in developing smart cities where 
predictions of accidents and traffic flow in the cities can be effectively monitored; smart 
health care where the doctor is able to get useful information from the implant sensor chip 
in the patient’s body; industrial production can also be enhanced manifolds by efficient 
prediction of the working of machinery and smart metering in helping the electric distri-
bution company to understand the individual household energy expenses and making 
smart homes with connected appliances to name a few.
The 21st century is for IoT, where it is viewed as a network of physical devices com-
ing together from electronics, sensors, and software. It is envisioned that the network of 
approximately 27 billion of physical devices on IoT are presently available and the list 
grows. These  devices (Cars, Refrigerators, TVs etc.) can be uniquely identifiable through 
embedded computing system and can be connected from anywhere through suitable 
information and communication technology, to achieve greater service and value.
The “THING” in IoT means everything and anything around us that includes machines, 
buildings, devices, animals, human beings, etc. Today’s, smart health care, smart homes, 
smart traffic, and smart household devices use this technology for a better digital world.
3.1.1  Working Principles of IoT
IoT has a unique identification that is embedded relying on the RFID connections which 
does not need any human or human–computer intervention for its working (Ashton, 2009). 
The IoT devices use IPv6 addressing for a huge address space, which makes it operational 
with active monitoring by computers with network connectivity and controlled by sensors 
attached to that devices. This monitoring and control can be interestingly seen in smart 
home applications where one can turn on the air conditioner while returning from office 
on the way home.

Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence
3.1.2  The Internet of Insecure Things
IoT technology is undergoing incredibly fast development and is a heterogeneous net-
work of small yet lightweight devices; security aspects are to be addressed for IoT deploy-
ment so that it can suitably address the issues that may come in the way while used for 
both personal and commercial purposes (Eijndhoven, 2016). To that effect, the networking 
capability is incorporated into the IoT devices with proper encryption; firewalls and anti-
virus methods are applied to counter the security concerns. This way, the confidentiality 
of the data and privacy of the users are guaranteed. But, this poses some challenges also. 
For example, in our houses, we usually have a physical means of access control to decide 
on who can access our house and similarly we have physical means of authentication in 
deciding who can enter into our house and can use the available artifacts inside the house. 
Suppose we want to turn on the air conditioner in our house to make the room cool. Here, 
two possibilities arise: one is to do it by physically being present in the house and follow-
ing the procedures to switch on the AC. The other is, if we are away from home, to switch 
on the AC before we reach home so that the room is already cool by the time we reach 
home. In the second case, one is physically not present to switch on the AC. In order to 
switch on the AC, even though one is physically not present in the house, the AC should 
be connected as networked objects to have access control, which needs an extra layer of 
security in comparison to the early nonnetworked objects concepts, for preventing any 
unauthorized or malicious access to such devices.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 discusses artificial Intelligence 
(AI) basics followed by IoT basics in Section 3.3. The fusion of IoT and AI is discussed 
in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 discusses the implication of deep learning in IoT scenario. 
While Section 3.6 discusses the proposed methodology, Section 3.7 presents the results 
and discussion. Finally, we conclude in Section 3.8.
3.2  Artificial intelligence
As we move toward the highly connected digital world, everything or anything goes smart 
with the use of small lightweight sensors with distributed intelligence; a huge amount of 
data is being collected from such networked devices, which poses real-time challenges in 
dealing with them for better insights and making corrective action thereto. The data is so 
BIG a data that even if one takes a sample of it for processing, time and accuracy becomes a 
challenge. For example, in the case of wearable computing, where sensors are implanted in 
the human body and are interconnected and connected to the Internet, any health-related 
issues arising from the patient’s body can immediately be send to the concerned doctor for 
taking the necessary action. This type of real-time processing poses challenges to IoT for 
its effective and efficient implementation. Here, IoT combined with AI may be thought of 
as a viable solution to address the issue at large and help to uncover the hidden informa-
tion from the data, for intelligent decision-making (Aadhityan, 2015).
3.2.1  Machine Learning 
Machine learning introduced in 1950 is considered to be a technique for AI, initially 
aimed at robust and viable algorithms for numerous applications such as bioinformat-
ics, intrusion detection, spam detection, forecasting, and the smart grid to name a few. 
Machine learning is a powerful tool for analyzing IoT datasets (Xu, 2015).

Internet of Things (IoT)
3.3  IoT Basics
IoT is considered to be the next step in the Internet evolution. As per European Commission, 
in the coming years, the integration of Internet with wireless communications and ­embedded 
wireless sensor networks will provide a paradigm shift in transforming our everyday devices 
into intelligent and context-aware ones (EU_Commission, 2009). Due to its ­technological 
structures, market shares, values, and earnings, it has found its place in almost all facets of 
human life, which can be unavoidable (Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011; Jain et al., 2011).
It is also envisaged that, in the near future, Internet will be integrated into a multi-
tude of things such as clothes, toothbrush, and food packaging  (Liu and Tong, 2010), with 
context awareness capability, pseudo-intelligence on processing capability among the 
connected things; also, efficient consumption of limited available power demands new 
forms of ­communication between things and people as well as between things themselves 
(Castellani et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2010).
The knowledge hierarchy showing how raw data are transformed into actionable 
­intelligence and finally help in the decision-making process in the context of IoT is shown 
in Figure 3.1.
The raw sensory data can be thought of as the lowest layer in the knowledge hierarchy 
process, where a large amount of data are being collected from many IoT devices in terms of 
Exabyte (EB) or even more than that as time progresses. The next layer preprocesses the raw 
data to obtain a structured, filtered, and machine understandable data ready for processing 
to get the information. The third layer provides us the knowledge by uncovering the hidden 
information from the structured data for taking intelligent action at the end.
3.3.1  Technology Challenges in IoT
As IoT tries to connect the things in a single network and generate a large amount of data 
for actionable intelligence, it poses several challenges to be addressed. Some of them are 
discussed below.
3.3.1.1  Data Integration from Multiple Sources 
The data generated from multiple sources such as sensors, social networking feeds, and 
mobile devices are all in different contexts; hence, the integration of all types of data is a 
challenge and if done efficiently, should be of a huge value addition for decision-making.
3.3.1.2  Scalability 
As IoT generates a huge amount of data, dealing with data volume, variety, velocity, 
and veracity poses a challenge for real-time operation to efficiently handle the data with 
­meaningful analysis.

3.3.1.3  Device Management 
In an IoT scenario, even though a large number of devices are interconnected (not all) 
among each other with servers for a wide region and can share the data effectively, still 
managing a device not connected to network but somehow involved in data communica-
tion process may pose some kind of data linking issues.
3.3.1.4  Device Diversity 
As many companies develop their products in a different way with different standards, 
making such devices in IoT to perform together is really a challenge.
3.3.1.5  Flexibility 
An IoT scenario shall be developed in such a way that the new device and technology 
improvements may suitably be taken care without much hindrance.
3.4  IoT and AI
Machine learning as a part of AI along with IoT finds lots of application in both research 
and industry (Poniszewska-Maranda and Kaczmarek, 2015).
3.4.1  IoT Challenges and Capabilities
As IoT is gaining everybody’s attention, there is an emergent need to understand the role 
of AI methods to gain insights into the market scenario and the readiness of the competi-
tors to address the situation by then. In an article published by Harvard Business Review, 
it has been well said that IoT should be capable of addressing the following four basic 
issues such as monitoring, control, optimization, and autonomy for making it more sen-
sible for the use of the customer in a smart connected environment. While monitoring 
is needed for the effective operation of sensor nodes in the working environment with 
utmost control, optimization is needed for improving the performance based on the feed-
back received from first two steps. Finally, autonomy makes the IoT work independently 
with self-­diagnosis and repair.
3.4.2  IoT Won’t Work without AI
As IoT produces big data where city traffic data can be used to predict the accidents and 
crime, it helps in building smart homes by digitally connected household appliances 
and much more. The information extraction from the sheer volume of data that are being 
collected from such IoT scenarios is a real challenge in order to see that IoT meets our 
expectations. It is also envisaged that dealing with such a huge amount of data (even if a 
sample of it) with traditional methods is too much of a time-consuming process. Hence, 
one needs to use AI methods incorporated to IoT data for improving the speed and accu-
racy. The negative consequences like, in home applications, all connected devices not 
working together will certainly annoy the customer; similarly, traffic can be mishandled

with hundreds of cars in line or may be disastrous in health with malfunction of the 
pacemaker, and the lists goes on.
3.5  Deep Learning and its Role for IoT 
In this section, an introduction to deep learning and its suitability to IoT datasets 
are ­discussed. In deep learning, sometimes referred to as fog clouding as shown in 
Figure 3.2, edge nodes are more capable of local computation among them through the 
network. In the more technical sense, deep learning is a single or set of algorithms that 
learn in the layer and mimics the brain as well, so that a hierarchy of complex concepts 
out of simple ones may be built by a computer.
3.5.1  How Does a Computer Learn? and How Do Deep Learning Algorithms Learn?
To understand deep learning with ease, it is required to have knowledge of how think-
ing and learning are done by computer with a top-down approach with all possible rules 
for its operations. But, now, it has a paradigm shift to have a bottom-up approach where 
the computer can learn from labeled data and the system is suitably trained based on 
responses. A  notable example of this scenario is playing chess with 32 chess piece as 
primitives and 64 actions squares, but in real-life scenario, deep earning presents huge 
problem space with infinite alternatives. Such a huge problem suffers from the curse of 
dimensionality, making the computer difficult to learn. In the case of text mining, such as 
sentiment ­analysis or recognizing words or face recognition, the data available are intui-
tive (or sparse) in nature and the problem domain is not finite; hence, it is very difficult to 
represent possible combinations to have meaningful analysis.
Deep learning is a machine learning algorithm that is best suited to address these 
­intuitive problems that are not only hard to learn but also have no rules with high dimen-
sionality (Najafabadi et al., 2015), in order to deal with hidden circumstances without 
knowing the rules a priori.

Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence
Deep learning is inspired from the working of the human brain. This mimics the 
­concepts of identifying a “cat” by a child by identifying the cat’s behavior, shape, the tail, 
etc. and then putting them all together for a bigger idea generation as the “cat” itself.
Following the example cited above, deep learning progresses through multiple layers 
and divides the intuitive problem into parts, with each part mapped to a specific layer. 
The first layer is the input or visible layer where the input is being provided, then a series 
of hidden layers selected randomly for specific mapping with input data. In the image pro-
cessing example, layer-wise information progress is made like: from input, pixels to edge 
identification at the first hidden layer, then corners and contours by second hidden layer, 
then parts of objects are identified in the third hidden layer, and finally the whole object is 
identified at the last and final hidden layer. This is shown in Figure 3.3.
In this chapter, our focus is to answer the following in a IoT scenario based on deep 
learning:
•	 The intuitive deep learning applications in smart city datasets
•	 The performance metrics used for better prediction that carry an intuitive 
component
3.5.2  Complementing Deep Learning Algorithms with IoT datasets
Although extensive research is being carried out in the area of energy load forecast-
ing and  its suitability in using neural network (Bhattacharyya and Thanh, 2004; 
Rodrigues et al., 2014), deep neural architecture is the most promising in this application 
scenario (Marino et al., 2016). Following are some of the emerging strategies/techniques 
that may be useful for complementing deep learning algorithms with IoT datasets.

Internet of Things (IoT)
3.5.2.1  Deep Learning Algorithms and Time Series Data
Considering that most sensor data collected from an IoT environment are time series in 
nature, applying deep learning techniques for energy forecasting is gaining the attention 
of researchers for developing a sustainable smart grid as a part of the future digital world 
(Busseti et al., 2012; Connor et al., 1994; Hong, 2010). This high-dimensional dataset when 
implemented with a deep neural network is found to perform better in comparison with 
other existing approaches such as linear and kernelized regression techniques and more 
importantly do not overfit.
3.5.2.2  IoT Implications
Since 2015, IoT has been emerging but the real impact is yet to be realized as the year 
­progresses with the development and deployment of a wide area network with 5G 2020 
and beyond. Considering the availability of such a Tsunami of mostly time series data, it 
will lead to an exponential demand for predictive analytic and for the development of a 
viable model and address the challenges thereto.
Our prime focus in this chapter shall be on using deep learning techniques, as a practi-
cal solution to IoT data analytic.
3.5.2.3  Implications for Smart Cities
As one can see, smart cities are an application domain for IoT, where digital technolo-
gies are used to enhance the performance of the IoT system with a reduction in cost and 
resource usage with an aim of active engagement of citizens for effective implementation 
to find its benefit at large for well-being of self. The applications include but are not limited 
to energy sector, health sector, transport sector, to name a few.
3.5.2.4  Deep Learning as a Solution to IoT
Deep learning basically concerns with neural network structure where many layers are 
used to solve the complex situations built from the simpler ones. The ability of deep learn-
ing to solve the curse of dimensionality problems with no rules make it an attractive one 
in IoT–big data scenario (Marino et al., 2016). The concept takes birth from the question of 
learning to identify a cat to recognizing it from its behavior, shape, etc.
As IoT mostly depends on the resource-constraint computing devices, our aim shall be 
to check whether deep learning can provide any interesting predictive analytic to obtain 
meaningful observations.
3.6  Proposed Methodology and Datasets Used
The proposed methodology of using deep learning in IoT dataset shall address some of the 
following questions:
•	 The applicability of deep learning in smart cities, smart health care, etc.
•	 What is the performance metrics for prediction?
The proposed methodology adopted in this chapter is shown in Figure 3.4.

Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence
3.6.1  Deep Learning with CNN 
Even though Deep CNN is somehow similar to linear neural network, the main differ-
ence lies in using a “convolution” operator as a filter that can perform some complex 
operation with the help of convolution kernel. It is to be noted that Gaussian kernel 
is used for smoothing an image; Canny kernel is used for obtaining the edges of an 
image, and, for gradient features; Gabor kernel as a filter is widely used in most image 
processing applications. At the same, while comparing with autoencoder and restricted 
Boltzmann machines, it is pointed out that DCNN is intended to find a set of locally 
connected neurons while the others learn from a single global weight matrix between 
two layers.
The central idea of using DCNN is not to be serious on using predefined kernels rather 
learn data-specific kernels where low-level features can be translated to the high-level ones 
and learning is done from the spatially close neurons.
3.6.2  Training DCNN
The training process of DCNN consists of two phases: feed-forward phase and back-­
propagation phase. In the first phase, all the tasks are passed through the input layer to the 
output layer and the error is computed. Based on the error obtained, the back-propagation 
phase starts with bias and weight updates for minimization of the error obtained in the 
first phase. Several additional parameters named as hyperparameters, such as learning 
rate and momentum, are set properly in the range of 0 to 1. Further, a number of iterations 
(epochs) that are required for training is also to be mentioned, for an efficient learning 
of the DCNN model so that the error gradient shall be below the minimum acceptable 
threshold. The learning rate should be chosen in such a way that it should not overfit or 
overtrain the model. The momentum value may be chosen with trial-and-error method for 
its best adaptability to the situations (Panda, 2016). It should be noted that if we chose high 
learning rate and high momentum value (close to 1), then there shall be always a chance 
that we may skip the minima.
3.6.3  DCNN Layers and Functions 
Initially, the concepts of Deep CNN were coined by LeCun et al. (2010). There are three lay-
ers in deep convolutional neural network such as input layer, one or more hidden layers, 
fully connected layers, and an output layer. The preprocessing starts at the input layer by 
applying the whole dataset to it. The middle layer is the hidden layer which is the heart of 
the DCNN layer and the number of hidden layers to be used in this stage depends largely 
on the input data. Convolution function is the process that involves in scanning a data

filter over the dataset used. The filter is thought of as an array of 2-D data of the size 3 × 3, 
5 × 5, 7 × 7, etc. The set of nodes obtained from the convolution process is termed as feature 
maps. While the dataset used is the input to the first hidden layer, the number of feature 
maps obtained from the previous layers becomes the input for the subsequent hidden lay-
ers. At the same time, for each layer, the number of output feature maps shall be the same 
as the number of filters that is to be used in the convolution process. Based on the type of 
convolution function used in the process, the size of the output feature maps can be deter-
mined. As the feature extraction process depends on the size and number of filters used in 
each hidden layer, processing the large dataset with huge parameters demand a high-end 
computing environment with large memory capabilities for providing optimum perfor-
mance (Panda, 2016). In this, use of the random filter is a good choice that is represented in 
the range of [−1 to +1]. The output from the convolution process is applied to an activation 
function for linear or nonlinear transformation across different layers so that the output 
falls in the range of [−1,+1] or [0,1]. Although several activation functions are available, we 
use rectified linear unit activation function for our analysis which says that for input x and 
output y, f(y) = 1, if x>0, and f(y) = 0, otherwise. Finally, pooling function is used (here, we 
use max-pooling) for down sample and to downsize the input features’ map to half of its 
original size. Dimensionality reduction on the datasets shall be achieved by the end of this 
stage.
The fully connected layer is the last but one to the DCNN layers where the result is 
obtained as a single vector after consolidating the previous layers single-node output fea-
ture maps. As this stage leads to classification of the dataset, proper weights and bias 
are applied to this layer so that the cost of misclassification falls below a certain thresh-
old or else the back-propagation process gets initiated for better weight and bias updates 
across layers for error minimization. Finally, the output layer presents the desired out-
put. Different hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum are then specified to 
have a faster convergence.
3.6.4  Smart Grid 
Cloud computing also has many useful applications in smart grid, and data mining is one 
of its most significant attributes. A smart grid generates huge volumes of data through the 
weather conditions, solar or wind characteristics, network intrusions, people’s electricity 
consumption, and how much electrical power people add from their own rooftop systems 
continuously to the grid. Utilities will need to store that data, and cloud computing is the 
solution for that. Once smart grid data are stored in the cloud, utilities will need data min-
ing techniques to develop knowledge from the raw data. They will use the data to deter-
mine the relationship between demand and supply or to explain customer impressions 
or opinions about their smart grid services. So cloud computing, data mining, and smart 
grids are all very closely related.
It is worth noting that the quality of the intelligence we gain from data mining will be 
influenced by the quality and quantity of data we have available to us. Smart grid is creat-
ing a wonderful database that is a resource for monitoring the system and even solving 
operational problems. But the database needs to be comprehensive and demands a good 
database for every section of the smart grid. This way, it is envisaged that “Internet of 
Things” will help implement smart grids
The IoT generally connects to any object, whether the object is an element in the smart 
grid, a human being, or any other physical entity. It is capable enough to transfer the data

automatically over a network without any personal or human-to-computer interaction. It 
uses a combination of wireless technologies, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), 
and the Internet. 
The IoT will play a significant role in smart grid (Al-Ali and Aburukba, 2015). It is 
intended to perform network safety management, network operations, and maintenance, 
and further can be used to monitor end-user interactions and finally more importantly to 
make the smart grid secure. The IoT is not only a big world of connected devices but also 
a tool that we can use to implement a smart grid.
In order to meet the growing demand for electricity, we cannot be afraid of these new 
techniques and systems. The technologies and applications needed for smart grid are a 
50–50 combination of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) and tra-
ditional grid technologies. We have these technologies. We just need to integrate ­existing 
systems.
While smart grid technologies are available, people from both ICT and utility engineer-
ing communities do need to work together to make the smart grid dream come true.
3.6.5  Metrics Used
Smart grid data and analytics will revolutionize the way power is managed, delivered, 
and  sold. While collecting accurate, timely, and relevant data is of prime importance 
for any data analytic program, the data need to be put into an appropriate context to 
obtain  useful information. The following are some of the fundamental analytical data 
transformations which have immediate relevance to smart grid applications: aggrega-
tions, correlations, trending, exception analysis, and forecasting. Many high-value analyti-
cal processes ­combine several of these techniques as part of an overall analytical process 
(Ranganatham, 2011). We use forecast method for our implementation in this chapter.
3.6.5.1  Forecasts 
Forecasts are predictions of future events or values using historical data (Aung et al., 2012). 
For instance, a forecast of power consumption for a new residential subdivision can be cre-
ated using history from similar homes. Forecasts can also be built using correlation data. 
For example, a forecast could be a simple prediction to understand the effect of one incre-
mental megawatt of power consumption for each one-degree rise in summer temperature 
above 40°C, or it could be a more finer and sophisticated set of algorithms that forecast 
maintenance expenses based on the age of equipment, utilization trends, and past service 
trends for similar equipment.
3.6.6  Datasets Used
This section discusses the datasets used in our experiments.
3.6.6.1  UMass Smart* Microgrid Data Set 
A microgrid data (Barker et al., 2012) is a new paradigm developed by the inclusion of 
distributed generation of smart grids. This dataset includes electrical data from over 
400 homes. In the course of the Smart* project, investigation is made based on design, 
­deployment, and efficient use of smart homes for sustainability.

52
Internet of Things (IoT)
3.6.6.2  Residential Energy Consumption Survey Data 
The Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) data (Kavousian et al., 2012) were 
collected in 2005 through a national survey on residential energy-related data, where 4,381 
households in housing units were randomly selected to represent the 111.1 million hous-
ing units in the United States. These data were obtained from residential energy suppliers 
with the consumption and expenditures per unit sample. The consumption and expen-
ditures and intensities data are divided into two parts: In the first part, the data provide 
energy consumption and expenditure by census region, population density, climate zone, 
type of housing unit, year of construction, and ownership status, whereas in the second 
part, the same data are provided according to household size, income category, race, and 
age. The next update to the RECS survey (2009 data) made available in 2011, summarized 
in Table 3.2, has been used in this study.
3.6.6.3  The Reference Energy Disaggregation Data
The Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set (REDD) (Kolter and Johnson, 2011) contains 
home electricity data: one is with high-frequency current/voltage waveform data of the 
two power mains and the other is lower-frequency power data with mains and individual 
labeled circuits. The low_freq directory contains average power readings for both the power 
mains and the individual circuits of the house with plug loads and plug monitors. The data 
are logged at a frequency of about once a second for mains and once every three seconds for 
the circuits. AC waveform data for power mains and a single-phase voltage for household 
purposes are present in the high-frequency directory. In order to reduce the data to a man-
ageable size, the waveform may be compressed using lossy compression. This is mainly 
because the voltage signal in most homes is approximately sinusoidal (unlike the current 
signals, which can vary substantially from a sinusoidal wave), and zero-crossings of the 
voltage signal to isolate a single cycle of the AC power are found. For the time spanned by 
this single cycle, both the current and voltage signals are recorded, and the entire waveform 
is then reported. However, because the waveform remains approximately constant for long 
periods of time, the current and voltage waveform at “change points” in the signal are only 
reported. The high-frequency raw directory finally contains raw voltage and current wave-
form without alignment and compression, for a small number of sample points throughout 
the data as the entire dataset consists of more than a terabyte of data.
3.7  Experimental Results and Discussion
All the experiments are conducted in an Intel Pentium 2.8 GHz CPU with 200 GB HDD 
and 2 GB RAM and Microsoft XP professional. At first, we use RECS data (Residential 
Energy Consumption Survey-2010, PART-1 and 2) as per the statistics provided below: with 
household size in Figure 3.5 and Table 3.1, with census region and division in Table 3.2, and 
then with a most populated state in  Table 3.3.

ahead, for getting insights for effective decision-making process. The results obtained for 
RECS data with all attributes and with energy consumption attribute only are provided in 
Figures 3.6 and 3.7.
3.7.2  Experiment 2: Prediction and forecasting using Deep 
Convolutional Neural Network with Microgrid Dataset
In the second experiment, we use microgrid dataset for predicting and forecasting the 
consumer behavior for a step further taken toward developing a sustainable smart grid 
environment. This is shown in Figure 3.8.

Internet of Things (IoT)
4.1  Introduction
In the digital era, the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) comes with enormous solu-
tions for relating and communicating among smart objects. Right now there are 14 billion 
IoT devices installed, and IoT acts as an umbrella covering different fields like manufac-
turing and logistics, agriculture, social networks, transport, health care, and hospitals. 
In 2014, Gartner estimated that by 2020 there would be 25 billion connected devices. Cisco 
predicted the number would be closer to 50 billion [1]. The importance of IoT in future can 
be easily depicted through Figure 4.1 [2].
The impact of IoT revolution assures to transform many aspects of our life. IoT technol-
ogy offers the possibility to reach out in all market segments and transform all fields by 
increasing the availability of information using networked sensors. However, IoT raises 
many issues and challenges that need to be considered and addressed in order to realize 
the potential benefits of IoT [3]. IoT researches have to be carried out based on the needs, 
including hardware and software technologies, as shown in Table 4.1 [4].
IoT can be related to five steps of maturity. Industries need capabilities to achieve each 
step process. Maturity continuum is shown in Figure 4.2.
4.2  Standards and Interoperability
With the expansion of IoT, it may be necessary to review various regulatory constraints and 
take steps to ensure sufficient capacity for expansion like seeking additional radio spectrum 
allocation as it becomes available. Interoperability is the capability of more than one system 
to exchange data and use information. Interoperability challenges can be taken in consid-
eration of different dimensions like technical interoperability, syntactical interoperability,

and semantic and organizational ­interoperability [5]. Table 4.2 depicts 
the challenges in IoT technical interoperability.
A specific challenge in this regard is ensuring global 
­interoperability, especially for things and devices which make 
use of radio spectrum. Without interoperability, devices cannot 
be networked around them. It is important to connect between 
two or more random devices which exchange messages anytime 
anywhere. Users don’t wish to get committed to a single vendor 
and they expect their devices to be connected among different 
vendors. The approaches to be addressed are (1) Do all devices 
speak the same language? (2)  Are intermediates required to 
translate their communication? The first issue arises due to the 
heterogeneity of the IoT, and this issue can be solved if we can 
agree on standards instead of constantly aiming to disrupt, define 
our own aspects of this growing ecosystem. The second issue is 
translating between many protocols and systems automatically, 
which  means we are moving from concrete data models to an 
abstract ­information model. The open-source project Eclipse 
Smart Home is an ­example of an intermediate-based approach. 
The standard can be defined as a model or a specific template to 
be followed. Standards should be designed to support a range of 
applications, and it should address the requirements of industry,

environment, society, and individuals. Standards are required for two-way communi-
cation and for exchange of information between things and environment. The design 
of IoT standards should focus on efficient use of energy and network capacity [6]. It also 
has to take into account other regulations which restrict frequency bands and power 
levels for radio frequency communication. For IoT, European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI) produces globally applicable standards related to informa-
tion and communication technology (ICT), and their goal is to strengthen the standard-
ization efforts of Machine to Machine (M2M). Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
has come out with the new group 6LoWPAN (IPV6 over Low Power Wireless Personal 
Area Networks) to integrate sensor nodes with IPV6 networks. Another group named 
ROLL (Routing Over Low power and Lossy) has come out with the routing protocol 
draft. It aims to provide basis for routing over low-power and lossy networks.
IETF along with other relevant organizations is working to come out with more 
standards. Many organizations are putting a lot of effort to standardize protocol to 
lower the cost of the IoT product. Although many protocols are emerging, at the appli-
cation layer, the contribution toward data formats and encoding of independent stan-
dardization of information (i.e., information model) is lacking. It is obvious that the 
emerging idea is to consider IoT standardization as an integral part of the future stan-
dardization process. Various issues faced in standardization are discussed in the fol-
lowing section.

Technical and Societal Challenges
4.2.1  Integration Issues
IoT is challenged in using mixture of devices interacting low-power devices with low capa-
bilities high end machines. This requires standards to enable a platform to communicate 
and operate, and program devices regardless of their model, manufacture, and industry 
application.
Devices with sensing capabilities are in the form of smart objects, where wireless sensor 
in IoT is expected to play a significant role. Integrating IoT with sensor networks raises 
challenges in terms of communication and collaboration.
The following section will explore ways and challenges faced in integrating IoT with 
sensor networks.
4.2.1.1  Network-Based Integration
In network-based integration topology, the sensors communicate to the Internet through 
their gateway as shown in Figure 4.3. In the case of a multi-hop mesh wireless topology, 
the sensors rely on a base node, which may have its own gateways to communicate directly 
or it might have connections indirectly through another gateway. Wireless sensor network 
(WSN) base node is used to connect indirectly through another gateway.
4.2.1.2  Independent Integration
In independent integration topology, the sensors can connect directly to the Internet with-
out the intervention of base point. Figure 4.4 shows the independent integration topology. 
However, providing independent IP address for each small sensor which has smaller 
packet size is the challenge behind this topology in assigning individual IP address for 
every IoT device.
This leads to communication and processing overhead associated with the use of TCP 
protocol.

4.2.1.3  Approaches to Overcome Challenges
To overcome this challenge, we need a platform-independent Application Programming 
Interface (API) for application developers and a way for different platforms to discover 
how to interoperate with each another. A further approach is the need to enable platforms 
to share the same meaning when data exchange happens.
The below case study discusses about the challenges in opting wireless standard for 
kidney stone formation monitoring system.
Kidney stone formation monitoring system is an innovative, technical, IoT-based 
solution that has been developed to minimize the possibility of kidney stone forma-
tion in human beings. Biologically, stones are formed due to unbalanced levels of pH 
(acidity and alkalinity) of urine. Therefore, by using the proposed system, doctors 
can monitor the pH level of urine and prescribe diet changes in order to avoid stone 
formation. The system senses the pH levels in urine using pH sensor directly when a 
person urinates in the closet and sends the pH level data over the Internet to the doc-
tor using wireless standard. The major challenge behind this system is selecting the 
appropriate wireless standard among the different standards available. Standards 
play a major role in creating a worthy market for a new technology and increasing 
the interoperability [1].
There are different types of wireless standards significant for IoT. These standards 
can be operated with distance as their main constraint, which ranges from a few 
centimeters to many kilometers. For short- to medium-range communications, wire-
less personal and local area network (WPAN/LAN) standards are recommended. 
For long range communications, wireless wide area network standards (WWAN) are 
recommended. Among these types of wireless standards, short- to medium-range 
communications, WPAN/LAN standards are highly compatible for the proposed 
system because data are sensed by a pH sensor and sent to cloud platform for remote 
accessing. WPAN/WLAN offers many different standards for communications, such 
as Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and 6LoWPAN [2].

4.2.2  Open Interconnect Consortium
Many standard bodies, consortiums, and alliances are currently working on IoT standard 
issues. Few of the standards are shown in Table 4.3 [7].
Overcoming the challenge of interoperability and standardization may be the single 
most important hurdle for IoT for mass usage, as it enables the boundless connections in 
a connected world.
LOW-POWER WI-FI MODULES
The Wi-Fi module has an advantage in reducing the power consumption of battery 
used in sensor-based applications and also eradicates the installation of extra gate-
ways to communicate with existing Wi-Fi modules. It supports IEEE 802.11 protocol, 
which provides transferring of data throughput in the range of hundreds of mega-
bits per second. Wi-Fi devices can be interoperable with other devices using certain 
gateway mechanisms.
ZIGBEE AND 6LOWPAN MODULES
ZigBee and 6LoWPAN supports IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for low-power consumption 
applications such as low-power wireless sensor networks. Hence, they are suitable 
in IoT applications in terms of low power consumption. The data rate of ZigBee and 
6LoWPAN is in the range of 250 kilobits per second. ZigBee devices can interoperate 
with other ZigBee devices using the Bluetooth profile. 6LoWPAN also offers interop-
erability with other wireless 802.15.4 devices as well as with devices of any other 
standard using a simple bridge device.
Based on the study and implementation, Wi-Fi outperforms the other standards. 
The transmission time of data on any network depends on the data rate, message 
size, and the distance between two devices. When comparing Wi-Fi with ZigBee and 
6LoWPAN, Wi-Fi acquires less time for data transmission because its data rate is 
higher than the other two standards. Wi-Fi standard operating at higher data rates 
also requires less power consumption and also sends or receives large amounts of 
data. While considering the distance coverage range, Wi-Fi covers the maximum 
70 m2 at indoor systems and 225 m2 at outdoor systems, whereas others cover a mini-
mum range of distance and do not fit the outdoor system. Therefore, the Wi-Fi mod-
ule is preferred for this proposed system of data transmission because of its high 
data rate, short-range connectivity, interoperability, and less power consumption as 
compared with other protocols.

4.3  Security
Every device involved in IoT represents a risk, and it is a major threat to an organization 
about the confidentiality of the data collected and the integrity of the dataset. Connecting 
low-cost IoT devices with minimal security mechanism will face ever-increasing poten-
tial security threats. IoT applications pose a variety of security challenges. For instance, 
in factory floor automation, the deeply embedded programmable logic controllers (PLCs) 
which operate robotic systems are typically integrated with the enterprise IT infrastruc-
ture. How can those PLCs be shielded from human interference at the same time protecting 
the investment in the IT infrastructure and leveraging the available security controls [8].
4.3.1  IoT Security Requirements
IoT involves sharing of data among users and objects or among objects themselves. In this 
environment, certain security requirements should be implemented. Basic IoT framework 
is shown in Figure 4.5 and the security at each layer is mandatory.

Technical and Societal Challenges
4.3.1.1  Device Layer Security
The device layer includes objects, places, and things can be simple devices like light bulb 
or complex devices like medical equipment. IoT security should be considered during 
design itself, and appropriate encryption should be made to maintain integrity and pri-
vacy. Devices should be designed to be tamperproof and the required software updates 
should be done constantly.
4.3.1.2  Gateway Layer Security
Gateway layer security indicates the messaging between the Internet enabled devices and 
other services. Gateway layer has to consider the security when communicating over pro-
tocols and has to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
4.3.1.3  Service Layer Security
The service layer security represents the IoT management activities like policies and rules, 
and automation of devices [9]. It has to focus on role-based access control and audit trail of 
changes done by devices or the users. Data monitoring should be done to identify compro-
mised devices during abnormal behavior.
A wide security risk has been uncovered in the IoT device. Open Web Application 
Security Project (OWASP) has identified the following top 10 issues in IoT devices.
•	 Insecure web interface
•	 Insufficient authentication/authorization
•	 Insecure network services
•	 Lack of transport encryption
•	 Privacy concerns
•	 Insecure mobile interface
•	 Insecure cloud interface

4.3.2  Security Challenges
IoT should be built in such a way that it assures consumers that their communication is 
done in a safe environment. To prevent an unauthorized user from accessing private data, 
IoT faces many security challenges and they are shown in Figure 4.7.
IoT research should address the following issues:
•	 Event-driven agents should be available to enable an intelligent/self-aware 
behavior of networked devices.
•	 Privacy-preserving technology for heterogeneous sets of devices.
•	 Models for decentralized authentication and trust.
•	 Energy-efficient encryption and data protection technologies.
•	 Security and trust for cloud computing.
•	 Data ownership.
•	 Legal and liability issues.
•	 Repository data management.
•	 Access and user rights, rules to share added value.
•	 Artificial immune systems solutions for IoT.
•	 Secure low-cost devices.
•	 Privacy policies management.

4.3.3  Approaches to Solve Security Challenges
To solve various security challenges, many approaches have to be taken, and security 
should be considered during design stage itself. Building security at the design stage 
starts at the operating system level and then at the design level and should be extended 
till deployment in particular application. Apart from designing, the organizations should 
provide appropriate access rights to the right people in the workplace and should also 
apply efficient data protection policies. Continuous monitoring of devices and its perfor-
mance measure should be maintained.
In the broad perceptive, IoT requires customized security and many researches have to 
be carried out in the IoT security field.
4.4  Data Collection, Protection, and Privacy
Data collection and protection of privacy in an IoT environment is the most significant 
thing to be focused on.
4.4.1  Privacy Concept
In IoT communications, privacy should be enforced over personal information and con-
strained should be placed over the storage and disclosure of information to others. The notion 
of privacy varies across different cultural perspectives. In one perspective, it is viewed as 
a fundamental human right and in another view, it has less importance. The notion of

Internet of Things (IoT)
privacy has changed and shifted over time. Initially, the installation of surveillances cam-
era was an invasive tool but now it has become common. IoT captures and communicates 
with any device that may involve using the existing infrastructure and Internet.
Today, Internet users, afraid of revealing personal information online, fill registration 
forms using false address details and name. In IoT, the background communication will 
happen between people, toys, washing machine and other appliances.
Deployment of sensors and a certain connection mechanism is required for applications 
or to render services in an organization. IoT is a combination of both public and private 
sectors. Traffic control systems and many other applications involve mass communication, 
with high degree of data getting transferred, connectivity being established, and interop-
erability happening. Everyday household items could be exploited by cybercriminals to 
gain access.
The question is who will have the control over the data which is surrounded in the 
environment. To influence users to participate in the IoT, an efficient mechanism for pri-
vacy and protection should be established. Users should be assured about the data and 
should have trust in communicating. To hold the trust and to protect the data, the follow-
ing domains should be taken care of. The domains include technical, industrial, regula-
tory, and sociological.
4.4.2  Privacy Exploitation
IoT comes with a lot of beneficial features for the users to enjoy but also poses challenges 
for the stakeholders. Security of the private data and control over the data are the main 
factors to be considered. One of the recent studies by ITU has found that 80% of mobile 
users surveyed in South East Asia are receiving one to five unsolicited messages from their 
mobile network operator per month.
Privacy challenges need to be solved before technology becomes a part of our daily lives. 
The issues involved in sacrificing private data would be the following:
	
1.	Obtaining personal data without the knowledge of the concerned person is done 
through object communication.
	
2.	Issue of incomplete and asymmetric information between data subjects and the 
person or objects that gather data.
Sensors and radio frequency identification (RFID) are the potential threats to the ­security 
of a user’s personal information [10].
4.4.3  Challenges
The IoT presents new challenges and needs response in the following areas which will 
have an impact on market, society, consumer rights, and policy making (Figure 4.8) [11].
The various challenges faced are:
•	 To ensure continuity and availability of data to provide the services.
•	 Protection should be incorporated at the design stage.
•	 To ensure protection rights for individuals and law for organizations.
•	 Multiple layers of security should be enforced.
www.ebook3000.com

71
Technical and Societal Challenges
•	 To ensure data privacy and location privacy.
•	 Certain law enforcement is required for enhancing technologies.
•	 Trust should be established for communication among objects.
Major issue in IoT privacy and confidentiality is about the data and the user involved. 
To  ensure confidentiality, numerous standard encryption technologies exist. The chal-
lenge behind is (1) the speed at which the encryption algorithm works and (2) the amount 
of energy it consumes. In IoT, the heterogeneity and mobility of things will create more 
complexity in privacy-preserving technology. Network and data anonymity can pro-
vide the basis for privacy but certain technologies are supported with high bandwidth 
and computing power. A similar question arises for authentication of devices and for 
­establishing trust.
Organizations have to identify the risk levels which are exposed to IoT and should think 
about the privacy and security requirements associated with volume of data. Trust in data 
privacy and protection should be taken into consideration for further research in IoT.
4.5  Socio-Ethical Considerations
Technological developments in this digital era will have an impact on the society either 
directly or indirectly. Although technologies like sensors, nano, and RFID have a role in 
threatening the privacy of data, these are also factors to be considered in socio-­ethical 
issues. The issue at stake is that although recorded video, navigation, and biometric records 
are used for the purpose of observation, they still create a fear about the usage of data. 
Communication between people is influenced by technology, as people prefer to text rather

than talk. Although nanotechnology increases safety and security, it still raises issues 
involving privacy, environmental hazards, and in the field of biomedical engineering.
Due to the pace of current technological innovations, it is important to ensure that 
the required and unrequired needs are categorized. Although IoT offers significant ben-
efits to the users as well the industries, the complexities and its impact on the societies 
should be considered. The socio-ethical issues can be considered only if there is increased 
awareness about the new technology innovations and their impact.
4.6  Scale
Scalability is the ability of the product to perform well besides the size of the device or 
volume of the data. The next wave of Internet is how things get done without interven-
tion of humans. There are more exciting applications like intelligent car and gateways, 
and brilliant hospitals built on connected devices. To achieve success and overall adop-
tion, the crucial concept must be the ability to scale. Data distribution service (DDS) is a 
data-centric technology and many DDS IoT real-time applications like air traffic system 
and connecting complex medical devices are complex tasks to be carried out. These sort 
of systems require good performance, have to achieve reliability, and ­support scale.
Messaging design allows distributed systems to scale to larger sizes. IoT systems will be 
built on thousands of different applications like hospitals comprising tens of thousands of 
different devices [12].
4.7  Radio Spectrum
IoT is set to enable a large number of unconnected devices to communicate and share data 
with one another and the wireless world communication leads to the need for more spec-
trums. In the next decade, connecting 50 million devices to the Internet would require more 
spectrum than is available today. Almost half of 389 MHz is involved in the pilot program of 
spectrum which is shared by the government and the commercial world. Although shared 
programs come with a solution, it is only a small initiative. Larry Strickling, the head of the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, insisted the requirement 
of the government’s goal of unleashing 500 MHz of new spectrum by 2020.
4.8  Other Barriers
The deployment of IoT and its development can slow down its pace due to the following 
barriers:
•	 Deployment of IPV6: IoT connects many tiny devices where billions of devices 
require unique IP address. This will prevent or will slow down the IoT’s progress 
and more security features are to be offered.
www.ebook3000.com

73
Technical and Societal Challenges
•	 Sensor Energy: Sensors involved in IoT need to be self-sustaining. Changing 
batteries among billions of devices deployed across the planet is quite a tedious 
task. Sensor energy is another challenging issue to consider in IoT.
•	 Legal, Regulatory Rights: Usage of IoT devices raises many legal questions 
and magnify many legal issues concerning the Internet. One issue concerns 
the cross-border data flows transmitting data from one jurisdiction to another. 
Legal and regulatory challenges have to be taken into consideration for ­evolving 
IoT laws.
•	 Flexibility and Evolution of Applications: Everyday sensors and devices evolve 
with new capabilities. This leads to the development of new techniques and algo-
rithms to analyze data. The development of applications with minimal effort and 
a comfortable platform is another challenge in IoT.
•	 Integration of Data from Multiple Sources: In IoT applications, data are streamed 
from different places like sensors, data from mobile devices, social network feeds, 
and from other web resources. Semantics of data should be part of data itself, and 
it should not be based on the application logic.
A survey conducted by Accenture in January 2016 was about barriers of purchasing IoT 
devices from the group of people aged greater than 14 years. The result of the survey is 
shown in Figure 4.9 [13].
•	 IoT Threats: Other security threats include (1) common worms jumping from 
ICT to IoT, (2) unprotected webcams, stealing content, (3) organized crime, and 
(4) cyber terrorism.
•	 Business adoption cycle: New technology adoption always goes through the 
business adoption life cycle. IoT is fundamentally the core model of the business 
in various fields. IoT is most disruptive technology and has to transform radi-
cally in all fields like medical, retail, transportation, manufacturing, and so on. 
Adoption of IoT depends on the removal of the barrier faced.

4.9  Green IoT
Impact of IoT in the next few years will create a mass environment surrounded by sensors, 
devices, and objects. By connecting physical objects and sharing information on the wire-
less medium, IoT plays a remarkable role in the growing world economy. Green IoT can be 
placed in two perspectives. On the one hand, it encompasses approaches that can be taken 
to cut carbon emissions and pollutions to enhance energy efficiency and on the other hand 
it is a way to design energy-efficient computing devices, communication protocols, and 
networking approaches for interconnecting devices [14].

ICT is a platform which relates any application, technology related to information, and 
communication which involves transmission. Green RFID is an approach to reduce the 
size of the RFID tags which decreases the amount of nondegradable material used in 
manufacturing. Energy-efficient algorithm should be applied to optimize tag estimation 
and adjust transmission power. Green WSNs can be achieved by making sensor nodes 
sleep during idle time. Boosting energy can be done through the environment sources 
like harvesting, kinetic energy, through solar panels, and through vibrations. Energy-
efficient routing techniques can be applied using clustering approach and multipath 
routing [15].
4.9.2  Future Work
The Green IoT can be incorporated with technology-based solar panels. More future 
work has to be carried out in Green IoT. The IoT solutions should give a feedback on 
energy usage and has to direct the user to efficiently allocate energy. Energy-harvesting 
approaches should be carried out in the environment. Energy issues such as energy 
­harvesting and low-power chipsets are core to the development of IoT. Current 
­technology support is inadequate for processing power and energy limitations in the 
near future.
Although many efforts have been placed in the advancement of IoT technologies, 
Green IoT still faces many significant challenges in different aspects. More research has to 
be carried out in this area.
4.10  Conclusion
The vision of IoT is an omnipresent range of devices leap to the internet in shaping human 
life. The prospects and benefits of IoT on the global scenario places various challenges 
related to technical and societal factors. Number of potential challenges, specifically in the 
area of standardization, interoperability, legal rights, protection, and privacy, have to be 
addressed for the benefit of people, society, and economy. Overcoming these challenges 
in industry and academia will be a prevailing approach for network and communication 
research to ensure that IoT is a powerful ­driving force in the future.

Internet of Things (IoT)
5.1  Introduction
Modern virtual society is digitally forwarding toward an “always connected” paradigm, 
where the Internet user is shifting from persons to things, conceptualizing toward Internet 
of Things (IoT). The IoT integrates a large number of technologies and foresees to embody 
a variety of smart objects through unique addressing schemes and standard communica-
tion protocols. IoT is a hot research topic, as demonstrated by the increasing attention and 
the large worldwide investments devoted to it.
It is believed that the IoT will be composed of trillions of sensory elements interacting 
in an extremely heterogeneous way in terms of requirements, behavior, and capabilities. 
According to CISCO IBSG (2011), by 2020 the Internet connected devices will reach 50 bil-
lion. Unquestionably, the IoT will pervade every aspect of our world and will have a huge 
impact on our everyday life: indeed, as stated by the US National Intelligence Council 
(NIC 2008) “by 2025 Internet nodes may reside in everyday things—food packages, furni-
ture, paper documents, and more.”
Then, communications will not only involve persons but also things, thus bringing about the 
IoT environment in which objects will have virtual counterparts on the Internet. Such virtual 
entities will produce and consume services, collaborate toward common goals, and should be 
integrated with all other services. One of the biggest challenges that the research community 
is facing currently is how to organize such an ocean of devices so that the discovery of objects 
and services will be performed efficiently and in a scalable way. Recently, several attempts have 
been made to apply concepts of social networking to the IoT. There are scientific evidences that 
a large number of individuals linked in a social network can provide far more accurate answers 
to complex problems than a single individual or group of—even knowledgeable—individuals 
(Surowiecki 2004). Such smart objects-based principle has been widely investigated in Internet-
related researches. Indeed, several schemes have been proposed that use social networks to 
search Internet resources, to route traffic, or to select effective policies for content distribution. 
To achieve the convergence among the cyber, adaptive services were addressed in the litera-
ture (Marti et al. 2004; Fast et al. 2005; Mislove et al. 2006; Mei et al. 2011).
There are various studies in the literature discussing the security issues of IoT applications. 
Juels (2006) and Van (2011) presented reviews on the security issues on IoT applications. 
The security solutions for social networks have also been presented by Tripathy and Panda 
(2010) and Tripathy et al. (2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d). However, the future discussion on the 
integration of security issues in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) system is missing. The 
domain of IoT applications has been strengthening in consumer products, durable goods, 
transportations, industrial utility components, sensors, and many more. The emergence 
of social network data analytics, link prediction, community grouping, recommendation 
systems, sentiment analysis, etc., with IoT will raise significant challenges that could stand 
in the way of realizing its potential benefits. In this chapter, we focus on these key issues 
and explore numerous views providing sufficient information therein.
The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. In Section 5.2, we present the basics of 
IoT and its technological evolutions. In Section 5.3, we discuss the basic concepts of social 
networking and its popularity. In Section 5.4, we describe the emergence of social network 
analytics into IoT. In Section 5.5, we discuss various security issues and research chal-
lenges pertaining to IoT, social network and SIoT. This section also exploits information 
in terms of questionnaires and references for further research and development applica-
tions. In Section 5.6, we discuss on pro-business and pro-people SIoT services. Finally, in 
Section 5.7, some concluding remarks are presented.

Evolution of Social IoT World
5.2  Technological Evolution of IoT
The first ever internet connected coke machine (at Carnegie Mellon University) could able 
to report its inventory and quantified the temperature of newly loaded drinks, which led 
to the concept of a network of smart devices (1982). The field started gathering momentum 
in 1999 by Kevin Ashton.
According to Cisco (Cisco IBSG 2011), the Internet of Things (IoT) was born sometime 
between 2008 and 2009. Today, IoT is well under way and would cross 50 billion connected 
devices (sensors to the internet) by 2020. Furthermore, the IoT is evolving toward a new era 
of technology in collaboration with networks of smart devices over the wired or mobile 
internet, mitigating with object to object or object to people interactions (see Figure 5.1). 
The IOT is emerging as a platform to integrate a large number of heterogeneous and per-
vasive electronic gadgets (sensors, actuators, RFID tags, electronic or electromechanical 
devices, smart phones, etc.) that continuously generate information about the physical 
world (Strategy, Unit 2005; Gubi et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2013). Most of this information is 
available through application programming interfaces (APIs) and seems to be overpopu-
lated with intensive interactions, heterogeneous communications, and numerous services. 
These would lead to issues of scalability, network navigability, real-time search, minimiza-
tion of local grouping, dynamic grouping, etc.
As the IoT continues to develop, its further potential is estimated by a combination with 
related technology approaches and concepts such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Future 
Internet, M2M, Mobile Internet Robotics, Sensor Networks, Semantic Search and Data 
Integration, Social Network, etc. The idea is of course not new as such but becomes now 
evident as those related concepts have started to reveal synergies by combining them. 
Overcoming those hurdles would result in a better usage of the IoT potential by a stronger 
cross-domain interactivity, increased real-world awareness, and utilization of an infinite 
problem-solving space. In Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6, we prompt for further allied approaches 
and discuss solutions to thematic questions.
As the IoT is in its early stage, enormous research is still going on to best suit ­applications 
in economic and social governance. As stated by the US National Intelligence Council 
(NIC 2008), “by 2025 Internet nodes may reside in everyday things—food packages, fur-
niture, paper documents, and more.” Some of the significant IoT executed ecosystems 
include smart cities (and regions), smart car and mobility, smart home and assisted liv-
ing, smart industries, public safety, energy, environmental protection, agriculture, and 
tourism. At the same time, policy makers are concerned about breaking away from old

ways of thinking about data as something to be tightly controlled. It is also expected to see 
new international policies to open up the data moving further than “big data.”
The architecture of IoT is viewed as data at motion and data at rest (White paper, CISCO, 
June 2014). Data initiate in the first layer from the physical devices and controllers (sensors, 
actuators, RFID tags, digital identifiers, etc.), which further pass through the communication 
and processing units (e.g., switches, gateways, Internet, and wire/wireless-3G/4G/5G com-
munications), edge computing and data accumulation (SAN/NAS/cloud storage), data 
aggregation and access. The second layer further processes data through “Applications of 
Reporting-Analytics-Control” and “Collaboration and Process.” As IoT evolves, independent 
individual networks will be connected with added security, analytics, and management 
capabilities (see Figure 5.2a) to be viewed as network of networks (see Figure 5.2b).
Researchers (Scott 2014; Ferguson 2016) are demonstrating to show that existing smart-
phone sensors can be used to infer a user’s mood, stress levels, personality type, bipolar dis-
order, demographics (e.g., gender, marital status, job status, and age), smoking habits, overall 
well-being, progression of Parkinson’s disease, sleep patterns, and happiness. Promoting 
privacy and data protection principles at hardware level will be paramount societal accep-
tance of IoT services. In this section, we limit our discussions to the evolution of technology 
in IoT; other challenges including security and threats are discussed in Section 5.5.
5.3  The Global Proliferation of Social Network
The Internet and its predecessors were a focal point for social interactivity. Computer net-
working was initially envisioned for military-centric command and control scheme, which 
further expanded to a great forum for discussing mutual topics of interest and perhaps 
even meeting or renewing acquaintances with other humans.
In the 1970s, CompuServe, a new avenue for social interaction, exploded onto the 
consciousness by allowing members to share files, access news and events, and interact 
through discussion forums. AOL (America Online) is considered as the Internet before the

Evolution of Social IoT World
Internet. During the 1980s, Bulletin Board System (BBS) used telephone lines via a modem 
for online meeting, which allowed users to communicate with a central system where the 
user could download files or games and post messages to others. BBSs were often used 
by hobbyists who carefully nurtured the social aspects and interest-specific nature of their 
projects. During the mid-1990s, Yahoo had set up shop and Amazon had begun selling 
books which perhaps provided encouragement for every household to have a PC. In 1995, 
the modern social networking concept was born through the site Classmates.com, cater-
ing the idea of virtual reunion of community. Early users could not create profiles, but 
they could locate themselves in their virtual community. It was a massive hit during those 
days. In 1997, the concept of six degrees was realized through SixDegrees.com. The theory 
somehow associated with actor Kevin Bacon that no person is separated by more than six 
degrees from another. SixDegrees.com facilitated its users to create profiles, invite friends, 
organize groups, and surf other user profiles. Its founders worked the six degrees angle hard 
by encouraging members to bring more people into the fold. Demographic-driven markets 
were evolved virtually through the sites like AsianAvenue.com in 1997, BlackPlanet.com 
in 1999, and MiGente.com in 2000. In 2002, social networking hit really its stride with the 
launch of Friendster. Friendster used degree of separation (similar to the SixDegrees.com) 
having a new concept of “Circle of Friends” dreaming to discover a different community 
between people who truly have common bonds. Within a year after its launch, Friendster 
boasted more than 3 million registered users and ample investment interests.
In 2003, LinkedIn took a decidedly more serious, sober approach to the social network-
ing phenomenon, making a resource for business people who want to connect with other 
professionals. Today, LinkedIn boasts more than 450 million members through its referred 
term “connections.” MySpace (2003) was once a favorite among young adult, demographic 
with music, videos, and funky, feature-filled environment. In 2004, Facebook launched as a 
Harvard-only exercise by university students who initially peddled their product to other 
university students. It remained a campus-oriented site for two full years and opened the 
access to public in 2006. Its innovative features, “Like” button, numerous built-in Apps 
made the platform user-friendly. The open API made it possible for third-party develop-
ers to create applications that work within Facebook itself. The site currently boasts more 
than 1.3 billion active users. Realizing the power of social networking, Google decided to 
launch Google+ in 2007. To date, it has more than 2.5 billion active monthly users. Over the 
course of the past 2 years, “Fourth screen” technology like smartphones, tablets, etc., has 
changed social networking and the way we communicate with one another entirely. Photo, 
video, and message sharing applications such as Snapchat, Instagram, and WhatsApp exist 
almost entirely on mobile. Users also use their smartphones to check in to various locations 
around the globe including matchmaking services (Foursquare). Mobile-based platforms 
blend social networking in an entirely different manner than their web-based counterparts.
Social network analysis uses two kinds of tools from mathematics to represent informa-
tion about patterns of ties among social actors: graphs and matrices. SNA-based graphs or 
sociograms consist of points (or nodes) to represent actors and lines (or edges) to represent 
ties or relations (see Figure 5.3a, b). However, when there are many actors and/or many 
kinds of relations, the sociograms become so visually complicated that it is very difficult 
to identify the patterns as shown in Figure 5.3c. It is also possible to represent information 
about social networks in the form of matrices. Representing the information in this way also 
allows the application of mathematical and computer tools to summarize and find patterns.
According to Tripathy and Panda (2010), a social network can be modeled as a simple 
graph G = (V, E, L, ζ), where V is the set of vertices of the graph, E is the edge set, L is the label 
set, and ζ is the labeling function from the vertex set V to the label set L, that is, ζ: V → L.

82
Internet of Things (IoT)
Social network analysis facilitates the methodologies to uncover patterns in 
its connections or relations among related entities. It has been widely applied to 
organizational networks to classify the influence or popularity of individuals and to 
detect collusion and fraud.
5.4  On Emergence of Social IoT
There is scientific evidence that a large number of individuals connected in social 
network can provide far more accurate answers to complex problems than a single 
individual. Even this makes more sense in comparison to a small group of knowledge-
able individuals (Surowiecki 2004). Social Network (SN) has already been solving these 
issues through friends’ selection, community finding, dynamic interactivity, profiling, 
online grouping, recommendations, and sentiment analysis since three decades. Thus, 
it makes sense on integration of SN into the IoT solutions, with unique addressing 
schemes, standard communication protocols, interaction with other objects (local/
global neighbors) to reach common goals (Sarma et al. 1999; Atzori et al. 2010). This 
would bring tremendous opportunities of research and development in the evolution 
of new paradigm of SIoT.
The emergence of the SN and IoT, which were up to now thought to be in parallel by 
both scientific and industrial communities, is gaining momentum for integration very 
quickly (Atzori et al. 2012). This is due to the increase in the awareness that IoT provides 
the connection to the physical world by sensing and actuating while SNs contribute 
toward many of the daily aspects of the human world. It may lead to desirable impli-
cations in a future world populated by smart objects permeating the everyday life of 
human beings catering economic and social issues (see Figure 5.4). Such prolific integra-
tion needs an improvement on the connectivity of all the relationships between users 
and things (smart objects), and to enhance the availability of computational power via 
sets of things surrounding us. IoT objects should be socialized to establish relationships 
with them and to predict the link based on trust in the community. It is analogous to 
the fact that increasing the availability of processing power would be accompanied by 
decreasing the visibility (Weiser 1991; Strategy 2005).

Evolution of Social IoT World
From various empirical studies on analysis of service and application typolo-
gies,  built  upon the envisaged SIoT, we find some relationships of socialization 
(Tripathy  et al. 2016) that are presented in Table 5.1 within the reference system 
architecture.
5.4.1  SIoT System Architecture
The three-layer architecture of SIoT system shown in Figure 5.5 is based on the simple 
architectural model of IoT (Zheng et al. 2011), having distinct components such as SIoT 
Server, the Object, and the Gateway.
In the SIoT Server, the network layer comprises various types of communication channels 
associated with the SIoT. The base sub-layer of application layer includes the database for 
the storage and the management of the data and the relevant descriptors. These records 
encompass the social member profiles and their relationships, as well as the activities car-
ried out by the objects in the real and virtual worlds. Such a view is extracted through 
appropriate semantic engines. Indeed, these semantic services are necessary to provide 
a machine interpretable framework for representing functional and nonfunctional attri-
butes and operations of the IoT devices. The top layer of the application layer consists of 
SIoT applications, the social agent, and the service management agent. The social agent is 
devoted to the communication with the SIoT servers to update profile, to update friend-
ships, and to request services from the social network. It also implements the methods to 
communicate with objects. The service management agent is responsible for the interfaces 
with the humans that can control the behavior of the objects while communicating within 
their social network.
As to the Object and Gateway systems, the combination of layers may vary mainly 
depending on the device characteristics. The following three scenarios can be foreseen.

Evolution of Social IoT World
In a simple one, a dummy Object (e.g., either an RFID tag or a presence sensing device) 
that is equipped with a functionality of the lowest layer is only enabled to send simple 
signals to another element (the Gateway). The Gateway is equipped with the whole set of 
functionalities of the three layers. In the second scenario, a device (e.g., a video camera) 
is able to sense the physical world information and send the related data over an IP net-
work. The object would then be set with the functionality of the network layer other than 
that of the application one. Accordingly, there is no need for a Gateway with Application 
Layer functionality. An Application Layer in a server, somewhere in the Internet, with the 
Gateway application layer functionality would be good enough. According to the third 
scenario, a smart object (e.g., a smartphone) may implement the functionality of the three 
layers so that the Gateway is not needed, but for some communication facilities targeted 
to maintain the Internet connectivity of the object. This is the case of a smartphone, which 
has enough computational power to perform all the three-layer operations and may need 
a Gateway for ubiquitous network connectivity.
As stated in many research works, Social IoT appears to be the next step in the evolution 
of ubiquitous computing. Figure 5.6 shows the Future SIoT architecture which is based on 
key elements like actors, an intelligent system, an interface, and the Internet. The smart 
things and users represent actors. Actors’ interaction is being managed by the intelligent 
system. Interactions among actors are facilitated through the interface. The Internet pro-
vides for open access among all the involved entities.
5.4.2  SIoT Applications
Many companies in different industrial sectors have already initiated the new trend of 
cutting-edge technologies to develop proprietary products and services that would drive 
the next wave of innovation in SIoT. These social devices ranging from low-cost sensors 
to powerful embedded systems can gather data and communicate these data over the 
Internet to social networks of people and devices who can respond to a problem, deliver 
a service, or sell a solution. Table 5.2 summarizes a number of off-the-shelf commercial 
social devices.

Internet of Things (IoT)
These are very appealing products that bring the new experience of SIoT to the cus-
tomers. Although, products have the provision of open APIs, most of the products avail-
able on the market are still not capable of interacting with other third-party devices and 
applications; this is a challenge for the future interoperability of SIoT products. We list out 
some of the identified common characteristics of the IoT products like Pachube, Nimbits, 
Paraimpu, ThingSpeak, and IoBridge.
•	 The objects use a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol to send and receive 
data. This choice allows high interoperability among the different platforms.
•	 An intermediary server is used. The objects do not communicate directly with each 
other.
•	 Every object has a “data point” associated with it on the server side to keep track 
of the data sent.
•	 The methods POST and GET are used to send and request data.

5.5  Security Issues and Research Challenges
The overall security and resilience of the SIoT is a function of how security risks are 
assessed and managed at the object level, during data communication, and at the level 
of analysis. Security of a device is a function of the risk that a device will be compromised, 
the damage such compromise will cause, and the time and resources required to achieve 
a certain level of protection. The security issues are not new in the context of information 
technology, but the scale of unique challenges that can arise in SIoT implementations, as 
discussed in this section, makes them significant.
Privacy is a very broad and diverse notion for which the literature offers many definitions 
and perspectives. From a historic view, the notion of privacy shifted between media, territo-
rial, communication, and bodily privacy. With the increasing use and efficiency of electronic 
data processing, information privacy has become the predominant issue. Information pri-
vacy was defined by Westin (1968) as “the right to select what personal information about me 
is known to what people.” Westin’s definition, although referred to nonelectronic environ-
ments, is still valid and general to enable the discussions about privacy in the IoT.
5.5.1  Security Challenges and Privacy Threats in IoT
Despite the immense potential of IoT in the various spheres, the whole communication 
infrastructure of the IoT is flawed from the security standpoint and is susceptible to loss 
of privacy for the end users. Some of the most prominent security issues plaguing the 
entire developing IoT system arise out of the security issues for information relay from 
one device to another. Privacy in the IoT is the threefold guarantee to the subject for:
•	 Awareness of privacy risks imposed by smart things and services surrounding 
the data subject
•	 Individual control over the collection and processing of personal information by 
the surrounding smart things
•	 Awareness and control of subsequent use and dissemination of personal informa-
tion by those entities to any entity outside the subject’s personal control domain
It is restated here that the application of IoT is fully dependent on its backbone of com-
munication network, including Internet or IP networks, wireless device-to-device com-
munication using Bluetooth, Z-wave, and Zigbee protocols. Out of several communication 
technologies, we take two most popular usages of communications, communications 
based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensor network (WSN), and 
discuss the probable security issues relevant to them.
5.5.1.1  RFID Technology: Security Issues
RFID technology is mainly used in information tags interacting with each other auto-
matically. RFID uses radio frequency waves for interacting and exchanging information 

88
Internet of Things (IoT)
between one another with no requirement for alignment in the same line of sight or physi-
cal contact. An RFID is made up of two components: transponders (RFID tags) and trans-
ceivers (RFID readers).
RFID Tag (transponder) consists of a microchip, memory embedded with an antenna. The 
memory unit has a unique identifier known as electronic product code (EPC). The func-
tion of the EPC in each tag is to provide a universal numerical data by which a particular 
tag is recognized universally. RFID tags are classified into active and passive types. Active 
tag houses a battery internally, which facilitates the interaction of its unique EPC with its 
surrounding EPCs remotely from a limited distance. Passive tags function without battery 
and the information relay through EPC occurs only by its activation by a transceiver from a 
predefined range of the tag. Tag Readers (transceivers) are proprietary in nature and operate 
in conjunction with RFID tags (active/passive). The EPC is the identifying signature of a 
particular tag under the scan of the reader. The RFID reader functions as the identification 
detector of each tag by its interaction with the EPC of the tag during its authentication. 
In their study, Mike and Medeiros (2007) and Qinghan et al. (2009) discussed security 
issues of RFID and categorized such attacks as follows: attack on authenticity, attack on 
integrity, attack on confidentiality, and attack on availability.
5.5.1.1.1  Attack on Authenticity (Unauthorized Tag Disabling)
Such attacks render an RFID tag to malfunction and misbehave during the scanning of a 
tag reader. Its EPC replies misinformation against the unique numerical identity assigned 
to it. This type of attack is generally exhibited remotely, allowing the attacker to manipu-
late the tag behavior from a distance.
5.5.1.1.2  Attack on Integrity (Unauthorized Tag Cloning)
The capturing of EPC identity information and manipulation of the tags by rogue readers 
falls under this category. Once the identity information of a tag is compromised, replica-
tion (cloning) of the tag is made possible which can be further used to bypass or counterfeit 
security measures as well as to introduce new vulnerabilities during automatic verifica-
tion processes (Qinghan et al. 2009).
5.5.1.1.3  Attack on Confidentiality (Unauthorized Tag Tracking)
A tag can be traced through rogue readers, which may result in giving up of sensitive 
information (like a person’s address). From a consumer’s point of view, buying a product 
having an RFID tag guarantees them no confidentiality if the tag is being tracked unau-
thorized. This leaks the privacy.
5.5.1.1.4  Attack on Availability (Replay Attacks)
In this case, the attacker uses a tag’s response to a rogue reader’s challenge to impersonate 
the tag (Mike and Medeiros 2007). In replay attacks, the communicating signal between 
the reader and the tag is intercepted, recorded, and replayed upon the receipt of any query 
from the reader at a later time, thus faking the availability of the tag.
5.5.1.2  WSN Technology: Security Issues
Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of independent nodes where communication 
(wireless) takes place over limited frequency and bandwidth. The communicating node 
has sensor, memory, radio transceiver, microcontroller, and battery. Due to the limited 
communication range of each sensor node, multi-hop relay of information takes place in 
www.ebook3000.com

89
Evolution of Social IoT World
between the source and the base station. An empirical study by Guicheng and Liu (2011) 
showed that multi-hop transmission of data demands different nodes to take diverse 
traffic loads. The required data are collected by the wireless sensors through collabo-
ration among the various nodes, which is then sent to the sink node for directed rout-
ing toward the base station. Some of the most prominent security issues plaguing the 
entire system arise out of the security issues for information relay from one device to 
another. According to Singla and Sachdeva (2013), the oppressive operations that can be 
performed in a WSN are due to the denial of service (DoS). This prevention of accessibil-
ity of information to legitimate users by unknown intruders can take place at different 
layers of a network.
5.5.1.2.1   DoS Attack: Physical Layer (WSN)
The physical layer of the WSN is attacked mainly through Jamming and Node Tempering. 
Jamming stems in the communication channel between the nodes (things) and thus pre-
vents communication between nodes. Node tempering refers to the physical tempering of 
any node (thing) to extract sensitive information.
5.5.1.2.2  DoS Attack: Link Layer (WSN)
DoS attack in this layer is due to Collision, Unfairness and Battery Exhaustion. The Collision-
type DoS attack is initiated when two nodes simultaneously transmit data packets on the 
same frequency channel. It results in small changes in the packet identifying a mismatch at 
the receiving end. It further leads to discarding of the infected data packet for re-transmis-
sion. Unfairness is a repeated collision-based attack. The DoS attack for battery exhaustion 
is caused by a large number of requests (requests to send) for unnecessary transmission 
over the channel. This leads to high traffic congestion in the channel  and the efficiency of 
node accessibility reduces drastically.
5.5.1.2.3  DoS Attack: Network Layer (WSN)
The DoS attacker tries to disrupt while routing which is the main function of this layer 
due to Spoofing, Homing, Sybil, Wormhole, Hello Flood, Acknowledgment flooding, 
and Selective forwarding. Spoofing occurs due to replaying and misdirection of traffic. 
Homing is the type of attack, where the traffic is searched for cluster heads and key man-
agers which have the capability to shut down the entire network. In a Sybil attack, the 
attacker replicates a single node and presents it with multiple identities to other nodes. 
Wormhole attack causes relocation of bits of data from its original position in the net-
work. Hello flood attack causes high traffic in channels by congesting the channel with an 
unusually high number of useless messages. In the Acknowledgment Flooding, a malicious 
node spoofs the acknowledgments and provides false information to the neighboring 
destination nodes. In Selective forwarding, a compromised node only sends to few nodes 
instead of all the nodes.
5.5.1.2.4  DoS Attack: Transport Layer (WSSN)
Flooding and de-synchronization are the two types of attacks observed in the transport 
layer of WSSN. Flooding refers to the deliberate congestion of communication channels by 
the relay of unnecessary messages in high traffic. In de-synchronization attack, fake mes-
sages are created at one or both endpoints requesting retransmissions for correction of 
non-existent error. This results in loss of energy in one or both the endpoints in carrying 
out the spoofed instructions.

90
Internet of Things (IoT)
5.5.1.2.5  DoS Attack: Application Layer (WSSN)
Through this layer, a path-based DoS attack is initiated by stimulating the sensor nodes 
to create a huge traffic in the route toward the base stations. Karlof and Wagner (2003) and 
Chen et al. (2009) discussed the severity of attacks in WSN and classified into five types of 
threats.
5.5.2  Security Issues in Social Networks
Privacy of knowledge may be leaked if a social network is released improperly to public. 
We have experienced the fact that when an individual, organization, or a social group 
innovates successfully, the knowledge on which that progress is based becomes visible, at 
least partially, in the immediate neighborhood. As time goes on, such progress is under-
stood and copied. Hence, there is a need for a systematic method to anonymize the social 
network data before it is released.
Now we would like to discuss about two basic concepts, label hierarchy and neighbor-
hood, which are basic inputs for anonymization methods in social network.
Consider an example for label hierarchy as shown in Figure 5.7. The items in the label 
set L form a hierarchy. If the occupations are used as labels of vertices in a social net-
work, L contains not only the specific occupations such as dentist, general physician, 
optometrist, high school teacher, and primary school teacher but also general catego-
ries like medical doctor, teacher, and professional. We assume that there exists a meta 
symbol * ∈ L which is the most general category generalizing all labels. Similarly, in a 
social network G, the neighborhood of u ∈ V (G) is the induced subgraph of the neigh-
bors of u, denoted by Neighbor G(u) = G(Nu), where Nu = {v|(u, v) ∈E(G)}. The compo-
nents of the neighborhood graph of a vertex are the neighborhood components. The 
d-neighborhood graph of a vertex u includes all the vertices that are within the distance 
“d” from the vertex u.
5.5.2.1  Neighborhood Attack
The example in Figure 5.8 illustrates how the neighborhood attacks can take place. Let us 
consider the graphical representation (see Figure 5.8a) of the social network in which a 
group of persons are connected to each other through the relation of friendship. An edge 
connecting two nodes represents that they are friends.
In Figure 5.8a, if an attacker has knowledge about the 1-neighborhood of “Fred” (see 
Figure 5.8b), the node “Fred” can be easily identified from the basic anonymized graph 
of Figure 5.8c, as no other node has similar 1-neighborhoods to that of “Fred.” Thus, 
the privacy of the social network is leaked. Once this node is identified, other private

91
Evolution of Social IoT World
information such as connectedness, relative position, and relation with other nodes (iden-
tified in the same way) is exposed. This necessitates further anonymization processes so 
that the knowledge about 1-neighborhood cannot be used to identify a node uniquely. In 
Figure 5.8a, if an edge is added between “Luna” and “Bill,” the 1-neighborhood of “Fred” 
and “Lily” is similar as shown in Figure 5.8b and c and it is not possible to identify ‘Fred’ 
with a confidence greater than ½ (see Figure 5.9a).
Tripathy and Panda (2010) discussed the usage of adjacency matrix and graph isomor-
phism to anonymize the identity of nodes or actors of the network. In their work, anony-
mization is done by taking the vertices from the same group. If the match is not found, 
the  cost factor is used to decide the pair of vertices to be considered. Their algorithm 
adheres to the k-anonymity security model. More importantly, the time complexities of 
their anonymized algorithms are comparatively less.
5.5.2.2  Social Network Anonymization
Identifiers are the key of the entities such as the data subject’s name, address, and some-
times the unique identification numbers (e.g., Social Security number or National Health 
Service number). These identifiers make an individual entity unique in a data set and 
as such highly vulnerable to re-identification. Anonymization is a technique that is used 
to shield, remove, or aggregate the basic identifiers in the data sets. Anonymizing social

Internet of Things (IoT)
networks data is much more challenging than anonymizing relational data due to many 
problems, some of which are listed below.
•	 It is much more challenging to model the background knowledge of adversaries 
and attacks about social network data than that about relational data. In a social 
network many pieces of information can be used to identify individuals, such as 
labels of vertices and edges, neighborhood graphs, induced subgraphs, and their 
combinations. So, all these make modeling social networks difficult.
•	 It is also challenging to measure the information loss in anonymizing relational 
data. Unlike for relational data for which the sum of the information loss for tuples 
solves the purpose, it is hard to compare two social networks by comparing their 
vertices and edges individually.
•	 Anonymizing a social network is much more difficult since changing labels of 
vertices and edges may affect the neighborhoods of other vertices, and removing 
or adding vertices and edges may affect other vertices as well as the properties of 
the network.
To protect the privacy satisfactorily, the models make guarantee that any individual can-
not be identified correctly in the anonymized social network with a probability higher 
than 1/k, where k is user-specified parameter in the k-anonymity model (Tripathy and 
Panda 2010). An adversary with the knowledge of neighborhood of a vertex cannot iden-
tify any individual from this anonymous graph with a confidence greater than 1/k.
Furthermore, Tripathy et al. (2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d) improved the clustering stage of 
the One Pass K-Means (OKA) algorithm, clustering Minimum Mean Roughness (MMeR) 
algorithm, and introduced l-diversity algorithms and variances using soft computing 
techniques like rough set theory. Such algorithms satisfy the privacy of individual nodes 
to the extent of anonymity in public social networks. These k-anonymity and l-diversity 
algorithms have the highest possibility of convergence of integration in the SIoT security 
threats.
5.5.3  Research Opportunities in SIoT
Social IoT is going to experience massive deployment of sensors and consumer objects which 
would affect the potential quantity of interconnected links between these devices (Ortiz et al. 
2014; Alam et al. 2015). Many of these devices will be able to establish links and communicate 
with other devices on their own in an unpredictable and dynamic manner. Therefore, exist-
ing tools, methods, and strategies associated with IoT security may need new consideration. 
Many SIoT deployments will consist of collections of identical or near-identical devices. This 
homogeneity magnifies the potential impact of any single security vulnerability by the sheer 
number of devices that all have the same characteristics. Some IoT devices are likely to be 
deployed in places where physical security is difficult or impossible to achieve. Attackers 
may have direct physical access to IoT devices or wirelessly hack such devices. Anti-tamper 
features and other design innovations will ensure security in SIoT. The social network-based 
collaborative approach will be an effective solution to industry, government, and public 
authorities to secure the Internet and cyberspace, including the SIoT.
We list out some questionnaires related to the security and probable threats and attacks 
in IoT/SIoT in Table 5.3. The list may be helpful to the students, academicians, and research-
ers who have an interest in this topic for further research investigations.

Evolution of Social IoT World
From a research point of view, it is wise to know about the institutions, organizations, 
and government alliances, who work and address issues on IoT, SIoT, and its variants (in 
particular privacy and threat issues). We list out in Table 5.4 such additional information 
sources which may serve as a starting point for further investigations to the interested 
researchers concerned.
5.6  Pro-Business and Pro-People Social IoT Services
Social IoT services can be modeled as pro-business and pro-people types. Facebook, 
Google, LinkedIn, and similar services are categorized as pro-business models, where 
users have to trade privacy for a free service and must agree to be tracked or snooped 
to generate a business intelligence database. In pro-people SIoT service, which we will

Research Questionnaires on Security Issues in IoT/Social IoT
•	What is the role of technical and operational standards for the development and deployment of secure, 
well-behaving IoT devices?
•	How do we effectively identify and measure characteristics of IoT device security?
•	How do we measure the effectiveness of IoT security initiatives and countermeasures? How do we ensure 
security best practices are implemented?
•	Would it be possible for regulation to keep pace and be effective in light of evolving IoT technology and 
evolving security threats?
•	How should regulation be balanced against the needs of permission-less innovation, Internet freedom, 
and freedom of expression?
•	What is the optimal role of data encryption with respect to IoT devices?
•	Is the use of strong encryption, authentication and access control technologies in IoT devices an adequate 
solution to prevent eavesdropping and hijacking attacks of the data streams these devices produce?
•	Which encryption and authentication technologies could be adapted for the IoT, and how could they be 
implemented within an IoT device’s constraints on cost, size, and processing speed?
•	Are the end-to-end processes adequately secure and simple enough for typical consumers to use?
•	With an extended service life expected for many IoT devices, should devices be designed for 
maintainability and upgradeability in the field to adapt to evolving security threats?
•	New software and parameter settings could be installed in a fielded IoT device by a centralized security 
management system if each device had an integrated device management agent. But management 
systems add cost and complexity; could other approaches to upgrading device software be more 
compatible with widespread use of IoT devices?
•	Are there any classes of IoT devices that are low risk and therefore don’t warrant these kinds of features?
•	Are the user interfaces IoT devices expose (usually intentionally minimal) being properly scrutinized with 
consideration for device management (by anyone, including the user)?
•	What is the right approach to take with obsolete IoT devices as the Internet evolves and security threats 
change?
•	Should IoT devices be required to have a built-in end-of-life expiration feature (bio-decomposable) that 
disables them? Such a requirement could force older, non-interoperable devices out of service and replace 
them with more secure and interoperable devices in the future. Certainly, this would be very challenging 
in the open marketplace.
•	What are the implications of automatic decommissioning of IoT devices?
•	How should we protect data collected by IoT that appears not to be personal at the point of collection or 
has been “de-identified”, but may at some point in the future become personal data (e.g. because data can 
be reidentified or combined with other data)?

Evolution of Social IoT World
discuss next, the users don’t have to trade their privacy for free service. They can opt in or 
opt out from available hundreds of services in one platform with a sign on system.
The bulky Privacy and Terms of Usage pages hardly anyone ever reads. In this pro-
business model, users can’t easily opt out to be snooped or tracked and must trade some 
privacy for one or more free services. Some free Apps like WhatsApp even target custom-
er’s phone contact list to shove them with targeted advertisements. All popular browsers 
are designed to track users by default. Business intelligence is generated from volunteered 
opt-in information and the legal Privacy and Terms of Usage agreements can fit in one 
paragraph or maximum one page that can be read once.
A typical web user, over his or her life time, could use many online services for numer-
ous activities like buying products, learning skills, paying bills, etc. If the user registers 
such service sites through e-mail, Facebook, or LinkedIn APIs (if supported by the web-
site), then the user would most likely be blasted with e-mails from those websites or will be 
followed to user’s timeline page. Either way, the user can’t escape tracking in any typical 
pro-business SIoT websites.
In addition to privacy, there are security and fake news concerns. Figure 5.10 shows up 
fake alerts during a search of a popular search engine that disables further browser activ-
ity. A typical user won’t know that these are rogue websites but the way search engines 
are designed, they can’t detect and block the stuff. Of late, during recent US presidential 
elections, credibility of Facebook also suffered because of “fake news.” Now, even if there 
is negative, but “true” news, supporters argue that as fake news.
Fan’s Global Social NGN LLC has been researching on a pro-people SIoT services since cou-
ple of years to develop a single sign on (SSO) platform to host multiple domains—around 
100 different services—where the names of websites contain the service names. All these 
websites share the same web platform and hence the platform is named as “Web Platform 
as Service” (WPaS). The common functionalities such as social button clicks, event logging, 
alerts and messaging are shared among all domains. If a user registers in any one of the ser-
vices (say, Service2Buy.com), the credentials would be valid for all the services like Malls2Go.
com, Videos4Rent.com, or Dating2Wedding.com that are hosted under the WPaS platform.
FIGURE 5.10 
Fake alerts during browsing.

96
Internet of Things (IoT)
With WPaS (see Figure 5.11), many existing popular web services, who lack their own 
social features and are not attractive to advertisers or subscribers, can simply bring their 
services to a WPaS platform and get all the platform features automatically and focus on 
core service and compete among other peers in WPaS. For example, two dating websites, 
Dating2Wedding.com and VideoMatrimony.com, can compete for subscribers by provid-
ing better features while not bothering about getting subscribers, authentication, and 
social features.
Because of the WPaS-based control of services, the user database is no more visible to 
service providers. When the user opts in to a business, product, or services, the respec-
tive advertisers get alert. The RDMBS-integrated Search based on opted information from 
users would be much better than that of the current search that can’t stop virus-infected 
URLS. The upcoming pro-user-based services of 100 domains would help users to get an 
alternative secure and private web space which would be free from fake news, virus, rogue 
security alerts, and above all much better search with easy-to-remember service names.
5.7  Conclusion and Future Perspectives
The concept of integrating sensors, mobile devices, computers, and networks to monitor and 
control devices has been around for decades. The recent development of key technologies and 
market trends is evolving into a new reality for the concept of IoT, which promises to usher 
in a revolutionary, fully interconnected “smart” world, with social relationships between 
objects and their environment. Independent objects and people are becoming more inter-
twined socially to evolve the concept of SIoT. As the potential ramifications to the evolution 
of SIoT are significant, a number of challenges also knock in the way of this vision, particu-
larly in the areas of security, privacy, interoperability, and standards like legal, regulatory, 
and demographic rights issues. Security breaches, link threats, and identity attacks may be 
serious hindrances to emerging global economies and demographic issues. Hence, through 
this chapter, we tried to address such challenges while reducing its risks in the domain of 
IoT. The Internet and social network theory provide numerous integrated solutions to IoT 
because of the growing aspects of how people and institutions are binding with and best 
utilize the Internet and network connectivity to their personal, social, and economic lives. 
This chapter justifies to these key issues and explores numerous views for further investiga-
tions by interested researchers providing sufficient information therein.

Internet of Things (IoT)
6.1  Introduction
Knowledge-based user authentication technique is a common and easy access con-
trol mechanism. But people are uninspired while choosing a healthy password or PIN. 
It increases the probability of guessing attacks. In this situation, to minimize these attacks, 
keystroke dynamics is a good choice; here users are not only identified by the password 
but their typing style is also accounted for. Keystroke dynamics is the method of analyzing 
typing pattern on a computer keyboard or touch screen and classifying the users based 
on their regular typing rhythm. It is a behavioral biometric characteristic which we have 
learned in our life and relates to the issues in human identification/authentication. This is 
the method where people can be identified by their typing style similar to hand writing or 
voice print. Being noninvasive and cost-effective, this method is a good field of research. 
But the performance of keystroke dynamics is less than other popular morphological 
­biometric characteristics like face print, iris, and finger print recognition due to high rate 
of intraclass variation or high Failure to Enroll Rate (FER). So, this technique demands 
higher level of security. In this chapter, we are interested in investigating the integration 
of the soft biometric features, gender and age group, with the existing keystroke dynamics 
user authentication systems proposed by [1–3].
We have investigated the probability of predicting gender and age group based on ­typing 
pattern. This is possible if all the patterns of certain peer are similar and dissimilar from 
one peer to another. As per the research direction, it is possible to predict the gender with 
88.55% to 95.04% accuracy based on typing pattern on the keyboard. Similarly, we also 
obtained 84.75% accuracy with regard to gender based on typing pattern on touch screen. 
If we use only gender information as an extra feature, then we can achieve 3.5% to 7.72% 
of accuracy. Similarly, the age group (18–30/30+ years) can also be predicted based on 
typing pattern. We obtained 86.87% to 94.68% accuracy with regard to prediction of age 
group (18–30/30+ years) based on typing pattern on keyboard, whereas 84.75% of accuracy 
was obtained by analyzing the typing pattern on touch screen with regard to age group 
(7–29/30–65 years). We also analyzed the age group (≤18/18+ years) and obtained 89.2% to 
92% accuracy based on typing pattern on touch screen.
These two biometric traits have low discriminating power but can be used as additional 
soft biometric features to reduce the error rate in keystroke dynamics user authentication 
systems. This technique can also be used in e-commerce sites to reach out to the right 
­client to avoid adverse products more efficiently based on the gender and age group. 
There are many application areas where automatic gender and age group identification 
methods can be applied like any surveillance system, online automatic user account 
­profiling, and protection of minors from online threats.
The main objective of this study is to develop a model that can identify the gender and 
age group of users through the way of typing on a computer keyboard and touching a 
computer screen for a predefined text, and it increases the accuracy by recognizing this 
soft biometric information as additional features in keystroke dynamics user authentica-
tion systems.
The major goal and contributions of this chapter are as follows:
•	 Develop an efficient model to recognize the gender and age group automatically 
from typing pattern.
•	 Validate the model on keystroke dynamics dataset collected through a touch 
screen device.

User Authentication
•	 Compare our results with other leading approaches.
•	 Integrate both soft biometric features with keystroke dynamics user authentica-
tion systems and show the impact and effectiveness of our approach.
In essence, this study is one of the approaches to recognize the gender and age group of 
Internet users. The secret behind this technique is physical structure, hand weight, finger 
tips’ size, and neuro-physiological and neuro-psychological factors reflecting on the com-
puter keyboard which discriminate the gender and age group of the users.
We have used published and authentic CMU keystroke dynamics dataset [4] along with 
the datasets collected through android hand held devices [5]. The classification results 
to determine the gender and age group by using FRNN-VQRS showed that more than 
94% accuracy can be achieved through a computer keyboard while a touch screen device 
offered more than 84% accuracy. The details of the datasets are summarized in Table 6.1.
We have used Weka GUI 3.7.4 to evaluate and compare the leading machine learning 
algorithms on public keystroke dynamics datasets. Obtained results are reported with 
default parameter values in Weka.
This chapter is organized as follows. Related works have been described in Section 6.2. 
Section 6.3 describes the basic idea about keystroke dynamics. Section 6.4 compares the 
performance of keystroke dynamics with other behavioral biometric systems. Section 6.5 
represents the details of the datasets which have been used in our experiments. Our pro-
posed methodology has been clearly explained in Section 6.6. All experimental results are 
reported in Section 6.7. Results and Discussion have been explained in Section 6.8. The last 
section compares our system with that of others and highlights its achievements.

Keystroke dynamics technique started in 1980. Many journal articles, conference articles, 
and master theses were published. Figure 6.1 clearly indicates the ­increasing trends in key-
stroke dynamics research. Many datasets have been created considering different types of 
texts with different lengths from different subjects; many methods have been applied and 
many innovative ideas have come out from the previous studies. Some studies showed that 
keystroke dynamics holds better performance when using common words used daily than 
strong password-type texts. Modi and Elliott [6] showed that nonfamiliar words do not give

interesting results. Giot et al. [7] showed that the gender of an individual user can be identi-
fied based on who types a predefined text. Epp et al. [8] showed that it is possible to get the 
emotional state of an individual through keystroke dynamics. Khanna and Sasikumar [9] 
showed that 70% of users decrease their typing speed while they are in a negative state, and 
84% of users increase their typing speed when they are in a positive emotional state. Joyce 
and Gupta [3] observed that shorter and easy to type login texts were easier to impersonate. 
Killourhy et al. [4] conducted experiments to investigate the effect of clock resolution on 
keystroke dynamics. They observed that the equal error rate (EER) increased by approxi-
mately 4.2% when using a 15 ms resolution clock instead of a 1 ms resolution clock. Ru and 
Eloff [10] observed that password and user ID with normal “English-like” text seemed less 
discernible from each other than string combining special characters such as &, %, @, ! etc. 
Roy et al. [11,12] showed that it can be used as a password recovery mechanism and also 
can be applied in cryptosystem. In another paper, Roy et al. [12,13] applied 22 different clas-
sification algorithms on keystroke dynamics and showed that distance-based algorithms, 
namely Canberra, Lorentzian, scaled Manhattan, and outlier count, are the suitable classi-
fiers on keystroke dynamics in identification/authentication.
Data acquisition technique is the primary and most essential stage in keystroke dynam-
ics; here subjects are required to type only character-based text, purely numeric-based text, 
or alpha-numeric-based text. Character-based text can be further sub divided into short 
text, long text, and paragraph. Alpha-numeric text can be further sub divided into strong 
text or password-type text and logically strong text. Figure 6.2 indicates the ­percentage 
distribution of the type of texts used in literature.
Most of the time, simple, common, fixed-size words used daily were used along with 
multiple predefined words (long text) in literature. As per the experiment, if we consider 
familiar words for all subjects in our experiment, we can get a consistent typing style 
across different sessions and each repetition from all the subjects. Performance of key-
stroke dynamics in user authentication/identification depends on type of text: famil-
iar words are suitable than password-type texts and password-type texts achieve more

accurate results than texts containing only digits [14]. Bleha et al. [1] showed that longer 
words minimize the misclassification rate.
Many type of keystroke features have been used in literature. A percentage distribution of 
keystroke features has been indicated in Figure 6.3, where combination of key hold time of a 
single key and latency times between two subsequent entered characters are the mostly used 
features. Some researchers say that di-graph time is the most elementary timing feature in 
keystroke dynamics, but only 12% of di-graph timing features have been used. Key pressure 
is also applied as an effective feature in keystroke dynamics where a special keyboard or a 
pressure-sensitive keyboard is required. As technology evaluation grows, many advance 
and sensitive hardwares have been used in smart phones or ­portable devices. Through the 
advance sensing devices, we can get some additional effective features such as finger tips 
size, velocity of finger movements in different directions [15].

The methods were used on keystroke dynamics datasets, where statistical measure-
ments are common like mean, median, and standard deviation. Many distance-based 
algorithms were also used as pattern recognition techniques such as Canberra, Chebyshev, 
Czekanowski, Gower, Intersection, Kulczynski, Lorentzian, Minkowski, Motyka, Ruzicka, 
Soergel, Sorensen, Wavehedges, Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance, Mahanobolis 
Distance, Z Score, and KMean. Some machine learning methods also have been applied like 
support vector machine (SVM), naïve bayes, multi layer perceptron, fuzzy set, K-nearest 
neighbor, OneR, hidden Markov model (HMM), Gaussian Markov model (GMM), and ran-
dom forest. Other methods like direction similarity measure (DSM), degree of disorder, 
and array disorder were also used. ACO, PSO, Best First, and GA were used as optimiza-
tion techniques.
Many classification methods have been applied over the last 30 years. Where statisti-
cal methods were common, over the last 10 years, strong machine learning and distance-
based methods are common approaches. Figure 6.4 indicates the percentage distribution 
of the type of methods used in literature.
To test the biometric system, few parameters (EER, FAR, FRR, etc.) are used to evaluate 
the performance of the system. Figure 6.5 indicates the percentage distribution of average 
EER previously recorded. The European standard for access control specifies that FAR 
must be less than 1% and FRR must not be more than 0.001% [16]. But in literature, only 
1.36% of studies [17,18] reached those acceptable results. In [17], large samples were col-
lected from each subject in training session which is impractical in real life, whereas Ali 
and Salami [18] used only key pressure as keystroke features and took data from only 
seven subjects, with the scalability of the study being very low. Hence, further research has 
to be done on keystroke dynamics for identification/verification of users since the applica-
tion area of this technique is very large.
To summarize, most of the works have been studied on datasets collected through a 
computer keyboard than a touch screen device. Many researchers have created the dataset 
and applied classification algorithms and obtained the results. Some of the researchers 
worked on optimization techniques and endeavored to enhance the keystroke dynamics 
user authentication performance. Giot et al. [7] extracted the gender feature only from the 
typing pattern on computer keyboard, but did not work on the typing pattern on touch 
screen. They also used this soft biometric feature with the timing features and obtained 
gain accuracy of up to 20%.

6.3  Keystroke Dynamics
6.3.1  Basic Idea
Keystroke dynamics is the method of analyzing the way users type on a computer key-
board and classifying the users based on their regular typing rhythm. Here, users are not 
only identified by their corresponding used ID and password, but their typing style is 
also accounted for. In this study, people can be recognized by their typing style much like 
hand writing or voice print. Recognizing typing style promises a parameter like behav-
ioral biometric characteristics in biometric science to solve the issues in identification and 
authentication technique. It facilitates nonintrusive, cost-effective, and continuous moni-
toring. It is a behavioral biometric characteristic which may vary during the course of a 
day or between 2 days; it depends on the mental state of the person, educational level, 
position of keyboard, and many more. This technique, as such, is prone to issues related to 
accuracy. Thus, in order to realize this technique in practice, a higher level of security and 
performance together with convenient and low-cost version is demanded with an accept-
able level of accuracy. So, controlling parameters that optimize accuracy to a great extent 
is necessary.
6.3.2  Science
Placement of fingers on keyboard, hand weight, hand geometry, and neuro-physiological 
factors reflect on keyboard indicating a unique typing style for each individual just like 
each person’s written signature.
6.3.3  Features
The features of the keystroke dynamics are Key Duration (KD) Key Latency, Up Up (UU) 
Key Latency, Down Down (DD) Key Latency, Up Down (UD) Key Latency, Down Up (DU) 
Key Latency, Total Time (T_Time) Key Latency, Tri-graph Time (T), and Four-graph Time (F). 
Some new features can also be incorporated such as key pressure (pressure-sensitive key-
board is required), finger tips’ size (touch screen keypad is needed), finger placement on 
keyboard (camera is needed), keystroke sound (microphone is needed) which were used

in [6], along with error correcting mechanism, sequence of left–right control keys. Dwell 
time and UD Key Latency times were used most of the time; Janakiraman et al. [19] used 
only di-graph and tri-graph time.
6.3.4  Keystroke Dynamics as User Authentication
There are many ways in which a user can be authenticated. However, all of these ways can 
be categorized into one of three classes: “Something we know,” for example, ­password; 
“Something we have,” for example, token; “Something we are born with,” for example, 
physical biometric characteristics; and “Something we have learned in our life,” for 
­example, behavioral biometric. Keystroke dynamics behavior is behavioral biometric 
­characteristics what we have learned in our life.
6.3.5  Advantages
In this technique, no extra security apparatus is needed; here the keyboard is enough to 
recognize the typing behavior. It is cost-effective and easy to implement with the existing 
system. This characteristics cannot be lost or stolen and nothing we have like password to 
remember. We cannot mimic the typing style of others.
6.3.6  Disadvantages
External factors such as injury, fatigue, type of keyboard, and position of keyboard affect 
the system. The typing pattern of a person may vary during the course of a day or between 
2 days and is dependent on his or her mental state. More datasets are required to fine-tune 
the system. It takes a lot of time.
6.3.7  Application Areas
This technique can be effectively applied in student or employee attendance system, 
­distance-based examination, password recovery mechanism, emotion recognition, pri-
vate  data encryption, continuous user verification, criminal investigation, backdoor 
accounts identification, free-text user authentication, gender identification, age group 
­recognition, etc.
6.3.8  Security Issues
Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral characteristic which is unique and can be effectively 
implemented with the existing system with minimal alternation. It can be used to safe-
guard our password from different types of attacks.
6.3.9  Factors Affecting Performance
Some of the factors that affect the working of keystroke dynamics is as follows: text length, 
sequences of character types, word choice, number of training sample, statistical method 
to create template, mental state of the user, tiredness or level of comfort, keyboard type, 
keyboard position and height of the keyboard, hand injury, weakness of hand mussel, 
shoulder pain, education level, computer knowledge, and category of users.

6.4  Evaluation of Behavioral Biometric Techniques
Jain [20] presents an extensive comparison of various behavioral biometric techniques in 
Table 6.1. He proposes a table that presents evaluation of those parameters for behavioral 
biometric technique in the following scale: H = high, M = median, L = low.
The following parameters are generally used to evaluate the biometric technique.
6.4.1  Universality
It defines how commonly biometric is found individually. The number of users of 
­computer-/handheld-device-enabled Internet connection is rapidly increasing and 
the  keyboard has become a mandatory device. But entered texts may not have the 
same  sequence for all the users. Universality of keystroke dynamics is the ratio 
between the number of users having same sequence of characters and total number of 
users [19].
6.4.2  Uniqueness
It is a measurement of how well biometric separates individuals from others. It is globally 
accepted that typing rhythm is unique for all. Most of the time, experiments were done in 
a controlled environment with impressive results. But due to a large number of affecting 
factors, it is not accepted in practice.
6.4.3  Permanence
It defines that how much complexity to measure in acquisition. Timing parameters are 
very easy to calculate in keystroke dynamics. But to measure key pressure and accelera-
tion, extra sensors are required. Nowadays, advance sensing device and accelerometer are 
embedded in each smart phone to measure pressure and acceleration.
6.4.4  Collectability
It represents how well it resists the aging problem. Typing behavior varies during the 
course of a day or between 2 days. So updating the mechanism is necessary.
6.4.5  Performance
Performance of all the behavioral biometrics is low. Many papers have been published 
with impressive results in a controlled environment. But in practice, it is very hard to 
achieve impressive results.
6.4.6  Acceptability
It describes the degree of approval of a technology. Many commercial products have 
been introduced; trademarks of the products are BioPassword, AuthenWare, TypeSence, 
Phylock, etc.

108
Internet of Things (IoT)
6.4.7  Circumvention
How easy it is fraud specific biometric characteristics. Keystroke dynamics is not easy to 
mimic even if you observe the typing style of others many times.
6.5  Benchmark Soft Biometric Datasets on Keystroke Dynamics
In this section, we describe the datasets used in our experiment. Many variants of authenti-
cated datasets on keystroke dynamics are available on the Internet, which can be downloaded 
or accessed on request. In this chapter, we have used four datasets for different predefined 
texts as well as different environments for the prediction of gender and age group. Table 6.2 
represents the details of the publicly available authentic and recognized datasets. All the 
datasets are given by a name for the purpose of identification throughout this chapter.
We summarized the different keystroke dynamics datasets in Table 6.2 which are used 
in our study. Most of the researchers have performed different experiments to develop 
a model to recognize the user with these datasets. Some of them obtained impressive 
results to identify the user, but they are not acceptable in practice. Datasets A, B, and C 
were collected through a computer keyboard. Dataset A was collected from 38 male and 
27 female users where 38 were aged 18–30 years and 27 were aged 30+ years; Dataset B 
was collected from 25 male and 13 female users where 23 were aged 18–30 years and 
15 users were aged 30+ years;. Dataset C was collected from 21 male and 21 female users 
where 24 were aged 18–30 years and 18 were aged 30+ years; and Dataset D was collected 
from 26 male and 25 female users using a touch screen device where 11 were aged 7–18 
years, 30 were aged 19–29 years, and 10 were aged 30–65 years.
6.6  Proposed Methodology
Biometric systems are not 100% accurate as per Jain et al. [21] due to various problems in 
data acquisition methods or interclass variations. As per previous studies, accuracy can 
be improved by using the soft biometric information as additional features with the typ-
ing pattern in keystroke dynamics. Giot et al. [7] used gender as additional information to 
predict gender with 91% accuracy. In order to realize this technique in practice, we have 
used FRNN-VQRS to predict the gender as well as the age group of the users based on 
the typing pattern of different predefined texts which elicited more than 94% accuracy on 
CMU keystroke dynamics dataset. The performance metric, area under curve (AUC), is 
always high and proved FRNN-VQRS to be an efficient approach. In this study, we applied 
gender and age group as additional features and obtained 94.37% accuracy in keystroke 
dynamics authentication which is a gain of 6.29% using the same algorithm as a recogni-
tion method for predefined text “.tie5Roanl.” The proposed methods are described in the 
following subsections:
6.6.1  Data Acquisition and Feature Extraction
It is the most fundamental and essential part in any biometric system. Here, key press time 
(P) and key release time (R) in millisecond unit are recorded while typing user ID and

password as raw data in keystroke dynamics technique. Then some common features are 
calculated by the following equations:
Key hold duration time (KD)=Ri−Pi
(6.1)
Interval time between two subsequent keys released (RR)=Ri+1−Ri	
(6.2)
Interval time between two subsequent keys pressed (PP)=Pi+1−Pi	
(6.3)
Interval time between one key released and next key pressed (RP)=Pi+1−Ri	
(6.4)
Interval time between one key pressed and next key released (PR)=Ri+1−Pi	
(6.5)
Interval time between first key pressed and last key released (t-time)=Rn−P1	
(6.6)
Interval time between one key pressed and third key released 
(Tri-graph-time)=Ri+2−Pi
(6.7)
Interval time between one key pressed and fourth key released 
(Four-graph-time)=Ri+3−Pi
(6.8)
In our experiment, we have used only KD, DD, and UD for Dataset A, B, and C, respec-
tively, as typing features, but we have used all the above features while working with 
Dataset D which we have extracted using Equations 6.1 to 6.8.
Key pressure, finger tips size, finger movements, choice of control keys, type of frequent 
errors, and choice of error correction mechanisms also can be measured for better perfor-
mance in identification/authentication [5]. As per the study, these features could discrimi-
nate the gender and age group as well.
6.6.2  Normalization and Feature Subset Selection
Normalization is the first preprocessing step where we standardized the data within the 
range {−1, 1} for faster processing. Feature selection method is used to find out the optimal 
or close to optimal subsets of features when some irrelevant features are captured. It opti-
mizes the accuracy rate along with computational speed. However, in our study, we have 
not used any feature selection methods.
6.6.3  Gender and Age Group Recognition
We have evaluated 11 leading machine learning methods and calculated the accuracy listed 
in Tables 6.3 and 6.4. We have divided total instances into 10 folds for cross-validation; here, 
in each stage, 1 fold will be treated as a test set and others will be treated as training sets. 
All the evaluation processes have been done with the supplied default parameter values 
by Weka. Then, we have added this additional information to each sample as additional 
features by assigning 0 for male and 1 for female; 0 for the age group 18–30 years and 1 for 
the age group 30+ years to learn about the system manually.
SVMs a popular supervised machine learning method has been introduced by Vapnik 
et al. [29] in 1995. Nowadays, SVMs have been widely studied in recognition and classifica-
tion techniques to balanced datasets and have shown tremendous success in handwriting

User Authentication
recognition to text classification. Due to the remarkable success rate, SVMs are also used in 
keystroke dynamics not only to identify the user but also to recognize the soft biometric 
information. A support vector–based machine distinguishes imposter pattern by creating 
margin which separates other patterns from that of the imposter, which provides a learning 
technique for pattern recognition and regression estimation. It is commonly used and effec-
tive for large practical problems. To predict the gender, Giot et al. [7] used libSVM—a library 
of SVM. But in our study, we have used FRNN.
As a recognition method, FRNN classification algorithm with vaguely quantified rough 
sets is more suitable. This method is an alternative to Sarkar’s fuzzy rough ownership 
function (FRNN-O) approach [31]. FRNN uses the nearest neighbors to construct lower 
and upper approximations of decision classes, and classifies test instances based on their 
membership to these approximations [22]. FRNN-VQRS is a new approach to FRNN. 
The hybridization of rough sets and fuzzy sets has focused on creating an end product 
that extends both contributing computing paradigms in a conventional way.

6.6.4  Classification and Decision
Machine learning methods are widely used in pattern recognition domain. The ­purpose 
of classification is to find the closest or the near-closest class to the claimed class. Statistical 
methods such as mean, median, and standard deviation; distance-based algorithms 
such as Euclidean, Manhattan, scaled Manhattan, Mohanobolis, z score, Canberra, and 
Chebycev; and some machine learning algorithms such as SVM, multi layer perceptron, 
OneR, J48, naïve bayes, nearest neighbor, fuzzy, neural network, and random forest can 
be used. But in our experiment, FRNN-VQRS has proved that it is an efficient approach 
in this domain.
Here, the claimant’s feature data are compared to the reference template using classifica-
tion algorithm, and a final decision will be made based upon the classification accuracy. 
To increase the user authentication accuracy, we have integrated gender and age group as 
soft biometric features with timing features.
6.7  Experimental Results
In this section, we present the results obtained from our evaluation process. Eleven 
machine  learning algorithms were applied on each dataset and accuracy with 10-fold 
cross-validation were listed to predict the gender identity in the Table 6.3 and to predict 
the age group identity in the Table 6.4. As per obtained results, FRNN and FRNN-VQRS 
have proved that they are suitable learning methods to predict the gender as well as age 
group in both desktop and android environments. Accuracies were recorded by Weka 3.7.4 
­simulator with default parameter values.
From the literature survey, it has been observed that gender information as additional 
feature improves the performance of keystroke dynamics user recognition. Figure 6.6 indi-
cates that the age group information can also be used to improve performance. Further, if

we used both gender and age group as additional features instead of only gender, then 
the accuracy of the system will be improved. The gain accuracies are described in detail 
in Table 6.5.
6.8  Discussion
In order to solve the problem of gender and age group prediction, we have employed 
Fuzzy Rough K-NN and FRNN-VQRS, mainly because of higher and consistent 
­accuracy status. This could help to learn about the system and also could be used 
to improve the classification accuracy in keystroke dynamics user authentication 
­systems. The searched input is the key parameter to check the gender as well as age 
group. As per the results of our experiments, simple, commonly used words or pass-
word-type words are suitable to predict the gender and age group than only numeric 
text. It is also observed that desktop environment is more accurate than android plat-
form since simple text is concerned. This accuracy rate will be impressive if enroll 
ment phase (type of keyboard, timing resolution of the system, screen size of android 
device, etc.) is extremely accurate. This method will be more reliable and consistent 
if we include some additional features like mouse dynamics, key pressure propor-
tional to force, and hand weight which may be a good factor in desktop environ-
ment. In android platform, key pressure, acceleration, and finger tips’ size may be 
included where advance sensing device, accelerometer are embedded in each smart 
phone; so this technique can achieve promising results and can be used to predict 
the gender and age group of Internet users for smooth, fake-free, and loyal social 
networking sites and can be used as additional features to improve the identity of the 
user through the typing pattern. We have not compared our approach with previous 
studies, because Giot et al. [7] used a different dataset where soft biometric informa-
tion is not supplied. They used only gender as additional information whereas we 
have taken both gender and age group as additional information. Generally speaking, 
gender prediction is a bit difficult of users in the 18-year age group due to intra-class 
variations. We have to take care of this.
In Figures 6.7 to 6.14, we can see that prediction of gender or age group by FRNN-
VRQS is possible based on the typing style on a computer keyboard or touch screen, 
and it does not depend on the type of text. But numeric text pattern is not much suitable 
than others.

6.9  Conclusions
The chapter employs machine learning methods to develop a model that predicts gender 
and age group based on keystroke dynamics features which significantly improve accu-
racy. Gender and age group alone are not sufficient features to identify the individual user, 
but they can be used as additional features. We have used three public authentic datasets 
on keystroke dynamics through keyboard, and one dataset through touch screen to verify 
whether or not this technique is applicable in both environments. Our proposed approach, 
FRNN-VQRS, a new approach to FRNN, achieved a gender and age group prediction accu-
racy of more than 94% in desktop environment, and 84.74% accuracy in android environ-
ment. We have used paired t-test where FRNN-VQRS is most significant than previously 
used libSVM by Giot et al. [7]. This is a very positive outcome in keystroke dynamics system 
for a single predefined text which can be used as soft biometric additional features in iden-
tification/authentication technique which improves the gain accuracy by 3.5% to 14.38%.
As per the obtained results listed in Tables 6.3 and 6.4, gender as well as age group of 
the users can be extracted from the typing pattern. It is also observed that both gender 
and age group information can be extracted from the dataset collected through the touch 
screen device. This is the first time we have used FRNN as per our knowledge on key-
stroke dynamics datasets instead of the very popular machine learning method, libSVM. 
In this chapter, we have also fused these two soft biometric scores with the timing fea-
tures to enhance the performance of keystroke dynamics user authentication systems. It is 
also observed that gender and age group information as extra features increase the user 
authentication performance instead of using only gender information. So, this technique 
can be used to predict the gender and age group of the Internet users as it is evident from 
our experiment, as keystroke dynamics is a common measurable distance-based activity 
to monitor the use of the Internet through keyboard/touch screen. It could be used to deal 
with the problem of fake accounts and would facilitate creation of a more loyal and authen-
tic social networking sites. This keystroke Dynamics user recognition with inclusion of 
personal traits as additional features is the modest and efficient approach.

7.1  Introduction
Presently, it is the era of nanotechnology which has introduced the concept and idea 
of nanodevices or nanomachines on a scale ranging from one to several nanometers in 
dimension. Nanotechnology has led to new nanomaterials with new properties and char-
acteristics that will usher in novel developments in nanodevices like nanosensor and 
nanorouter. These nanodevices are integrated to perform tasks such as sensing, acquisi-
tion, or transferring data through nanonetwork, which will cover unmatched locations 
to perform additional in-network processing. The emergency development technology 
that develops and creates nanomachines defines a new networking paradigm that con-
sists of an interconnection of nanoscale devices with existing communication networks 
and ultimately the Internet of nano-things (IoNT). The IoNT adds a new dimension to 
the Internet of things (IoT) technology by embedding nanosensors inside devices to

enable them to communicate through the nanonetwork via the Internet for global con-
nection among a lot of devices around the world. “Technavios analysts forecast the global 
­internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) market to grow at a CAGR of 24.25% during the period 
2016–2020” (Technavio 2016). The concept of IoNT was introduced by Ian Akyildiz and 
Josep Jornet who defined an architecture for electromagnetic nanodevice communication 
that includes protocols, channel modeling, and information encoding (Akyildiz and Jornet 
2010; Balasubramaniam and Kangasharju 2013). On the IoNT, nanonetworks are connect-
ing nanodevices which can sense, collect, process, and store information. These nanode-
vices communicate through nano-communication process which means transfer of data 
and information between ­different nanodevices inside the nanonetwork. This nano-­
communication process consists of two types, namely molecular and electromagnetic 
communication, as follows (Akyildiz et al. 2008):
	
1.	Molecular Communication (MC): This type of communication is defined as the 
exchange of information through the transmission and reception of molecules. 
These molecules will interact with nanodevices in a biological environment such 
as human body.
	
2.	Electromagnetic Communication (EM): This type of communication is defined 
as the exchange of information through the transmission and reception of electro-
magnetic radiation from nanodevices in nanonetworks. These radiations will be 
emitted in specific bandwidth for allowing nanodevices to interact and communi-
cate with each other.
The IoNT enabling technologies could pose new, severe security threats if managed 
with pernicious intent against IoNT infrastructure; therefore, security on the IoNT plays 
a vital role in providing safe and reliable communication environment between nanode-
vices in nanonetworks, which consist of nanodevices that can connect together to exchange 
information. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses in these nanonetworks. 
An attacker can also exploit the weakness of crucial health and safety equipment or the 
communication channel and trigger malicious instructions to jeopardize a patient’s life. 
For example, in the area of Internet of bio-nano-things (IoBNT), malicious people could 
hack bio-things which are used to access human body and create health problems by intro-
ducing new types of viruses that can cause new diseases. Current security mechanisms 
and techniques cannot secure nanodevices in the nanonetwork from malicious attacks and 
crimes because nanodevices work in terahertz band. To protect the IoNT infrastructure, 
there is a serious need to propose and develop new security solutions to prevent crimes 
related to the IoNT. The existing security solutions cannot be used directly for securing 
the IoNT infrastructure. Some of the suggested solutions for securing the IoNT environ-
ment are checking the integrity of data by using checksum algorithms, using encryption 
algorithms to encrypt data before transferring between nanodevices, using data hiding 
algorithms for hiding critical data, and using multi layer authentication to guarantee that 
only the user can access nanonetworks.
To investigate such attacks in the IoNT paradigm, there is a need to execute digi-
tal forensics procedures to find any digital evidence about criminal or illegal activities. 
Unfortunately, performing digital forensics investigation in the IoNT brings a new chal-
lenge for examiners and digital investigators as the existing digital forensics tools and 
procedures do not cope with the IoNT environment to collect and extract digital evidence 
from nanodevices inside nanonetworks. The huge number of nanodevices will generate a 
massive amount of possible evidence, which will bring new challenges for all aspects of

data acquisition for the forensic purpose, so that the investigators will find it a complex 
challenge for collecting evidence from the highly distributed IoNT infrastructure.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 7.2 introduces a brief back-
ground about digital forensics, IoT forensics, and IoNT while the new area of IoNT 
forensics (IoNTF) is presented in Section 7.3. Section 7.4 provides the proposed IoNTF 
investigation model and finally the chapter conclusion and future directions are pre-
sented in Section 7.5.
7.2  Background
This section introduces a brief overview about digital forensics, IoT ­forensics, and IoNT.
7.2.1  Digital Forensics
This section presents the concept of digital forensics and an introduction into current digi-
tal forensic investigation process to build the reader’s understanding of the discipline.
7.2.1.1  Definition
The first Digital Forensic Research Workshop (DFRWS) defined digital forensics as:
The use of scientifically derived and proven methods toward the preservation, ­collection, 
validation, identification, analysis, interpretation, documentation, and presentation of 
digital evidence derived from digital sources for the purpose of facilitating or further-
ing the reconstruction of events found to be criminal, or helping to anticipate unauthor-
ized actions shown to be disruptive to planned operations. (Palmer 2001).
7.2.1.2  Digital Forensics Investigation Life Cycle
From the digital forensics definition, the digital forensic investigation process involves 
several stages and steps to handle and manage the digital evidence that can be extracted 
from the crime scene as follows (Figure 7.1):
•	 Identification: This process involves the identification of an incident and the 
­evidence thereof, which will be required to prove the incident.
•	 Collection: In this process, an examiner and a digital investigator collect digital 
evidence from the crime scene.

Internet of Things (IoT)
•	 Extraction: In this phase, a digital investigator extracts digital evidence from dif-
ferent types of media, for example, hard disk, cell phone, e-mail, and much more.
•	 Analysis: In this phase, a digital investigator interprets and correlates the avail-
able data to arrive at a conclusion, which can prove or disprove an incident.
•	 Examination: In this phase, an investigator extracts and inspects the data and 
their characteristics.
•	 Report: In this process, a digital investigator makes an organized report stating 
his or her findings of the incident which have to be appropriate enough to present 
to the jury.
7.2.2  Internet of Things Forensics
Currently, the IoT has become an attractive research topic where interconnected devices 
known as “things” or “objects” with embedded processing abilities are employed to extend 
the usage of Internet capabilities to several application domains such as medical, industry, 
and military. The IoT is considered as a new environment that provides rich sources of 
data such as sensors that generate data. These sources can be used in conjunction with one 
another in the same IoT environment for certain purpose. The variety of these sources pro-
vides different challenges to the various forensics communities, especially the investiga-
tors who will be required to interact with this new technology to investigate crimes related 
to the IoT environment. In the IoT environment, a lot of devices or machines operate, such 
as wireless sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID), the Internet connection, intel-
ligent or smart grids, cloud computing, and vehicle networks that can integrate to each 
other in an intelligent manner. However, interconnecting of various “machines” also refers 
to the possibility of interconnecting various different threats and attacks. For example, a 
malware can easily propagate through the IoT at an unprecedented rate. In the following 
four design aspects of the IoT system, there may be various threats and attacks as follows 
(Giuliano et al. 2015):
	
1.	Data Perception and Collection: In this aspect, typical attacks include data 
­leakage, sovereignty, and authentication.
	
2.	Data Storage: The following attacks may occur: denial-of-service attacks (attacks 
on availability), integrity attacks, impersonation, and modification of sensitive 
data.
	
3.	Data Processing: In this side, there may exist computational attacks that aim to 
generate wrong data processing results.
	
4.	Data Transmission: During the transmission process, severe types of attacks 
may occur like session hijacks, routing attacks, flooding, and channel attacks. 
Therefore, efficient and effective defense procedures and strategies are of extreme 
importance to ensure the security of the IoT infrastructure.
In this remaining part, we will present the previous work in the area of IoT foren-
sics that may help researchers and scientists in the digital forensics field to introduce 
and propose new procedures and techniques in digital forensics in the field of IoNT 
because very little work was done in the field of IoNT Fx till writing this work. Some 
work has been done to explain the concept of “IoT forensics.” Also, new procedures and 
methodologies have been proposed and introduced to perform the digital investigation

process in the IoT environment. Oriwoh et al. (2013) proposed two methods for digital 
investigation in the IoT environment which are 1-2-3 Zones Digital Forensics and Next-
Best-Thing Triage:
	
1.	1-2-3 Zones Digital Forensics: This approach divides the IoT infrastructure 
into  three areas or zones to help in performing digital investigation process. 
These zones are zone 1, zone 2, and zone 3, as shown in Figure 7.2:
	
a.	 Zone 1: This zone is called the internal zone that includes all IoT smart devices 
like a smart refrigerator and TV that can contain valuable data about a crime 
committed in the IoT infrastructure.
	
b.	 Zone 2: This zone includes all intermediate components that reside between 
the  internal and external networks to support the communication process. 
These devices may be protection devices such as intrusion detection and 
­prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and firewalls. The digital investigators can find 
evidential data that help them to extract facts about a crime committed in 
­relation to IoT.
	
c.	 Zone 3: This zone includes hardware and software components that reside 
in the external part of the IoT Infrastructure such as cloud services and other 
service providers that use IoT devices and users. These components with hard-
ware devices and software in zone 1 and zone 2 will help digital practitioners 
to perform their investigation mission in a timely fashion manner.

	 This approach reduces the challenges that will be encountered in IoT environ-
ments and ensures that investigators can focus on clearly identified areas and 
objects in preparation for investigations.
	
2.	Next-Best-Thing Triage: The next-best-thing triage (NBT) can be used in conjunc-
tion with the 1-2-3 zones approach. This approach discusses to find an alterna-
tive source in the crime scene if it is unavailable after a crime occurred in the 
IoT environment. The NBT approach can be used to determine what devices were 
connected to the objects of forensic interest (OOFI) and find anything which was 
left behind after the devices were removed from the network. Direct access to 
the OOFI may not always be possible. Therefore, in such situations, the option of 
identifying and considering the next best source of relevant evidence may have 
to be taken. The design of a method of systematically deciding what this next 
best  thing might be in different scenarios and situations can be the subject of 
­further research.
Zawoad and Hasan (2015) introduced a forensics-aware IoT (FAIoT) model for support-
ing digital forensics investigations in the IoT environment in a reliable manner. The FAIoT 
model provides secure evidence preservation module and secure province module as well 
as access to evidence using application programming interface (API) that will reduce the 
challenge in performing the investigation. To facilitate the digital investigators, a central-
ized trusted evidence repository in the FAIoT is used to ease the process of evidence collec-
tion and analysis. The IoT devices need to register this secure evidence repository service. 
The FAIoT architecture shown in Figure 7.3 is as follows:
•	 Secure Evidence Preservation Module: This module will be used to monitor all 
the registered IoT devices and store evidence securely in the evidence ­repository. 
Also, segregating of the data according to the IoT devices and its owner will be 
done in this module. Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) will be used to ­handle 
a large volume of data.
•	 Secure Provenance Module: This module ensures the proper chain of custody of 
the evidence by preserving the access history of the evidence.
•	 Access to Evidence through API: In this model, a secure read-only APIs to 
law enforcement agencies is proposed. Only digital investigators and the court 
­member will have access to these APIs. Through these APIs, they can collect the 
preserved evidence and the provenance information.
Perumal et al. (2015) proposed an integrated model which is designed based on triage 
model and 1-2-3 zone model for volatile based data preservation. This model started with 
the following authorization, planning and obtaining a warrant as the fundamental steps 
in the digital forensic investigation process as shown in Figure 7.4. Then, it starts to inves-
tigate the IoT infrastructure and finally after seizing the IoT device from the selected area 
or zone, the investigator completes the digital forensic procedure which includes a chain 
of custody, lab analysis, result and proof, and archive and storage.
7.2.3  Internet of Nano-Things
The concept and idea of the IoNT are proposed and introduced by Akyildiz and 
Jornet (2010). The IoNT consists of connected nanodevices through the existing

telecommunication and network systems. The envisioned IoNT is shown in Figure 7.5. 
The IoNT added a new dimension for the IoT by embedding nanosensors inside things/
devices to enable them to communicate together through the nanonetwork and the 
Internet for global connection among devices around the world. The IoNT describes 
how the Internet will get bigger as nanosensors are connected to physical things such as 
physical assets or consumer devices for collecting, processing, and sharing of data with 
the end users. IoNT has various important applications such as smart agriculture, health 
care, military, logistics, aerospace, industrial control systems, manufacturing, and smart 
cities. There are new domains promised from the IoNT technology such as IoBNT and 
internet of multimedia nano-things (IoMNT) which will make new developments in

health care and multimedia fields. The terms of IoBNT and IoMNT can be briefly intro-
duced as follows:
	
1.	Internet of Bio-Nano-Things: The IoBNT refers to a paradigm-shifting con-
cept for communication and network engineering, where new complex chal-
lenges are faced to develop efficient and safe methods for information exchange, 
interaction, and interconnecting within the biochemical area, while enabling 
an interface to the electrical domain of the Internet (Akyildiz et al. 2015). The 
IoBNT stems from synthetic biology and nanotechnology tools that allow for 
biological engineering for embedded processing and computing machines. 
Depending on the basics of biological cells’ architecture and its functionality, 
from the biochemical viewpoint, bio-nano-things promise to enable applications 
and services such as actuation networks, environmental control of toxic agents, 
pollution, and intrabody sensing.

2.	Internet of Multimedia Nano-Things: Currently, nanotechnology is able to 
help in the development of new devices in nanoscale which are able to gener-
ate, process, and transmit multimedia content. The interconnection of pervasively 
deployed multimedia nanodevices with existing communication networks and 
ultimately the Internet to introduce a new field called the internet of multimedia 
nano-things (IoMNT). The IoMNT is a powerful field that can be used in many 
applications in the areas of security, defense, environment, and industry, among 
others (Jornet and Akyildiz 2012).
7.2.3.1  Network Architecture in IoNT
In the IoNT, the network is the interconnection of nanodevices to each other to facili-
tate communication between them through the existing communication networks and 
­systems. Akyildiz and Jornet (2010) introduced a network architecture for the IoNT for 
two applications which are intrabody nanonetworks for remote health care and future 
interconnected office as shown in Figure 7.6:
	
1.	Intrabody Networks: In intrabody networks, nanodevices like nanoactuators 
and nanosensors deployed inside the human body are remotely controlled over 
the Internet by an external operator as a health-care provider. The nanoscale 
is the natural domain of molecules, proteins, DNA, organelles, and the major 
­components of cells. Among others, existing biological nanodevices can provide 
an interface between biological phenomena and electronic nanodevices, which 
can be exploited through this new networking paradigm.
	
2.	Interconnected Office: In the interconnected office, each element found in an 
office and even its internal components are provided a nano-transceiver which 
allow them to be constantly connected to the Internet. As a result, a user can keep 
track of the location and status of all its belongings in an easy manner.

128
Internet of Things (IoT)
Besides this, Akyildiz and Jornet (2010) introduced the following components in the 
­network architecture of the IoNT:
•	 Nano-Node: This is considered as the smallest and simplest nanodevice. It can 
perform a computation and processing task, has limited memory, and can only 
transmit over very short distances due to its reduced energy and limited commu-
nication capabilities.
•	 Nanorouter: These nanodevices have comparatively larger computational 
resources than nano-nodes and are suitable for collecting information coming 
from limited nanodevices. In addition to this, it can also control the behavior of 
nano-nodes by exchanging very simple control commands such as on/off and 
sleep.
•	 Nano-Micro Interface Devices: This is able to collect information coming from 
nano-routers and convey it to the microscale, and vice versa.
•	 Gateway: This device gives the ability to control the entire system remotely over 
the Internet. For example, in an intrabody network scenario, an advanced cell 
phone can forward the information that is received from a nano-micro interface in 
our wrist to our health-care provider. In the interconnected office, a modem-router 
can provide this functionality.
7.2.3.2  IoNT Security
Nano-things can be vulnerable to physical and wireless attacks. For example, nano-things 
will be unattended most of the time, so they can face physical attacks. In addition to this, 
because of the involuntary physical damage, it is also likely to occur because of their almost 
indiscernible dimension. Different types of wireless attacks that include both traditional 
and new nano-things are possible and relatively simple, despite the fact that the nanode-
vices communicate at ultra-high transmission rates and over very short transmission dis-
tances. Existing security solutions cannot be directly used in the IoNT because they do not 
capture the peculiarities of the terahertz band physical layer and the heterogeneity in the

Internet of Nano-Things Forensics
capabilities of diverse nano-things. For this, future research trends should be along the 
following three main directions (Jornet and Akyildiz 2012):
•	 Develop Novel Authentication Methods: In various envisioned applications, it 
is critical to certify the identity of the transmitting or receiving nanodevices. Due 
to this, a very large number of nanodevices in the IoNT environment like IoMNT, 
­traditional authentication solutions that are based on complex authentication infra-
structures and servers, are not suitable for nanodevices. For this, novel authenti-
cation ­methods that exploit the network hierarchical structure of the IoNT are 
required. For example, nano-things might need to only authenticate themselves to 
the closer nanorouter or nano-to-micro interface; this can be done by means of a 
unique EM signature, which is a well-established property of terahertz radiation.
•	 Develop New Data Integrity Mechanisms: In communication networks, it is 
important to guarantee that an adversary cannot change the information during 
the transmission process. Data can be modified either when stored or when being 
transmitted. Due to the expectedly very limited memory of miniature nanoth-
ings, the first type of attack is unlikely. However, new techniques to protect the 
information in nanomemories will be developed by exploiting the quantum prop-
erties of single-atom memories to implement practical solutions from the realm 
of quantum encryption. In its turn, despite the information being transmitted at 
very high bit-rates, guaranteeing the data integrity while the information is being 
transmitted requires the development of novel safe communication techniques for 
IoNT environment.
•	 Develop Novel User Privacy and Security Mechanisms: Nano-things can be 
used to detect, measure, and transmit very sensitive and confidential infor-
mation, which in any case should be available to non-intended addressees. 
Moreover, due to their miniature size, nano-things will be usually impercepti-
ble and ­omnipresent. So, new mechanisms to guarantee the privacy in the IoNT 
are required. Among others, methods to guarantee that a user can determine 
and limit the type of information that nano-things can collect and transmit are 
needed. Moreover, physical-layer security methods need to be explored to pre-
vent problems like eavesdropping.
Novel security and privacy mechanisms will also be needed to protect sensitive data 
gathered by nanosensors, which can include detailed chemical and biological samples 
from individuals. For example, molecular nanonetworks could gather data about people 
infected with a harmful virus to shed light on the nature and severity of the disease. 
Safeguards must be in place to ensure that such data does not fall into the wrong hands. 
There are many challenges like information collected from nanosensors might include 
individuals’ molecular and genetic data. On the other side, there are also some solutions to 
solve it as a solution by implementing safeguards to ensure that sensitive IoNT data do not 
fall into the wrong hands (Balasubramaniam and Kangasharju 2013).
7.2.3.3  Data Management and Analysis in IoNT
In traditional sensor networks, the data acquisition and collection process commonly 
occurs via a static tree where each node in the tree senses the data and then passes it 
along the tree to the sink node at the root. This way of sensing could lead to enormous 

130
Internet of Things (IoT)
data traffic during transmission, particularly if sensing process is periodic; due to this, 
each microgateway connects with many nanosensors in the nanonetworks. A suitable 
solution for this problem is to think about another way that cannot be static but depends 
on the dynamic process in data collection in the tree; therefore, it is needed for interac-
tions from nano-node to another nano-node among microgateways. In both molecular 
and EM nanonetworks, the microgateway has to integrate data from different nanosen-
sors before sending it down the tree. However, the timing difference in data propagation 
between nanomachines could lead to long delays for reaching messages to the sink. For 
example, in molecular nanonetworks, information transmission could take a large time, 
especially when queries expect feedback. And also in electromagnetic nanonetworks, 
energy harvesting is a major constraint, as the harvesting process can take up to a min-
ute before transmission can occur. An ideal, time-delayed data fusion process must be 
implemented at the microgateway to process all information before further transmis-
sion along the data collection tree (Balasubramaniam and Kangasharju 2013). Figures 
7.7 through 7.9 can help to understand the data collection, management, and analysis in 
nanoscale networks that have new properties. This can provide a better understanding 
of the IoNT environments that help in developing novel methods and procedures to 
secure the IoNT environment.

7.3  Internet of Nano-Things Forensics
The digital forensic investigation process of internet of nano-things is called “IoNT 
Forensics.” The IoNT represents a big challenge for digital investigators and examiners 
to collect and extract digital evidence as admissible evidence about committed crime 
in the IoNT environment. To the best of the author’s knowledge, in this area, very little 
work is done to cover the IoNTF so that researchers and scientists who are working in 
the digital forensics area have to work to develop and design new methods, procedures, 
techniques, and tools to cope with new types of cybercrimes, attacks, and malicious 
and illegal activities. The IoNTF can identify itself as a special branch of IoT forensics, 
where the identification, collection, acquisition, analysis, examination, and presentation 
phases of digital investigation process will apply to the IoNT infrastructures to establish 
the facts about a crime that occurred. The digital forensic can be performed in the IoNT 
environment as well as its new sub domains such as IoMNT and IoBNT, as shown in 
Figure 7.10.
7.3.1  IoNT Forensics Definition
The IoNTF is the process of performing a digital forensics investigation in the IoNT. 
The IoNTF is a cross-discipline that combines the IoNT and digital forensics. We identify 
IoNTF as a combination of three digital forensics levels: nanodevice forensics level, inter-
net forensics level, and IoNT services/application forensics level, which are illustrated in 
Figure 7.11. Therefore, The IoNTF can follow the main phases of digital forensics according 
to each level in the architecture of IoNT.

7.3.2  Hypothetical Malicious Scenario
Alex is a doctor who monitors a patient’s case remotely through his mobile phone. 
This  patient stays in a hospital where there are various smart nanodevices connected 
for monitoring his/her case. Alex uses his mobile to control smart devices in his home, 
such as television, refrigerators, air condition, and several other smart devices remotely, as 
well as for monitoring his patient. Alice is a malicious attacker who developed a program to 
steal and control mobile phones remotely to perform illegal activities. Alice hacked Alex’s 
phone and started to control his phone and browse applications as well as control smart 
devices in home and hospital. John is a digital investigator who received a task to inves-
tigate this crime case and find facts about these illegal activities. When John started the 
digital investigation process, he faced various complex challenges to investigate this case 
as millions of smart devices and nanodevices are connected together through the Internet. 
John begins to think how to deal with the complex and huge connected devices, especially 
nanodevices that have new features and properties that are new to the forensics com-
munity. He starts by dividing his investigation to three levels; the first level to investigate 
devices and nanodevices, the second level to investigate the nanonetwork and the Internet 
connections through log files. Thirdly and finally investigate the application and services 
which are available in Alex’s mobile phone. This division will help John in his investiga-
tion task. The question here is how will John deal with these new nanodevices that have 
new unique features? Also, the existing digital forensics methods, techniques, and proce-
dures cannot cope with these types of devices. This led us to think about introducing this 
topic to the forensics community by providing some challenges and opportunities.

7.3.3  Challenges
The IoNT contains a large-scale source of potential evidence. However, due to the hetero-
geneous nature of the IoNT devices, the ways in which data are distributed, aggregated, 
and processed present challenges to digital forensics investigations. New methods, tech-
niques, and tools are required to overcome these challenges and leverage the architecture 
and processes employed in IoNT to gain access to this rich source of potential evidence. 
Current tools and techniques that are used for digital investigation are not suitable to inves-
tigate crimes in the IoNT environment due to new communication and standard protocols 
that will be used to adapt to this environment. There are many challenges and implications 
in the IoNT for performing the digital forensics in a timely fashion and effective man-
ner. The digital investigation process consists of six main stages and various steps. These 
six steps are identification, collection, extraction, analysis, examination, and reporting, as 
shown in Figure 7.1, where each step has the following new challenges in the IoNT domain:
	
1.	Identification: In the IoNT environment, there are billions of nanodevices which 
will generate enormous amount of data. This huge amount of data needs more time 
and special processing tools to identify evidential data that will help the examin-
ers and digital investigators to find any traces about an incident. This amount of 
generated data requires big data tools such as Hadoop for data processing and 
handling.
	
2.	Collection: In this process, an investigator identifies and collects digital evidence 
from the crime scene. The digital investigators collect evidence to extract valuable 
information about crimes committed in the IoNT environment and finds facts that 
will help build evidence against the attackers. The collection process is very impor-
tant for any digital investigator because it will complete the subsequent phases of the 
digital investigation process, with errors, if any, propagating to the remaining inves-
tigation stages; hence, this phase is considered the most crucial phase. In the IoNT, 
the collection process becomes more difficult and harder due to the massive amount 
of nanodevices that are connected together. The IoNT environment can contain large 
numbers of nanodevices that are connecting and communicating using new nano-
electromagnetic and MC systems. A digital investigator may find it an intricate chal-
lenge to collect data from this environment which has new properties. Within IoNT, 
expect to see a large amount of generated data from interconnected nanomachines 
that cannot be managed using traditional mining methods and procedures.
	
3.	Extraction: In this phase, investigators extract digital evidence from different 
evidential sources as well as preserve the integrity of the evidence. In the IoNT, 
evidential data extracted from collected digital evidence will take more time, 
especially volatile data from massive and complex connected nanodevices.
	
4.	Analysis: This phase is a vital phase in the digital investigation for interpreting 
and analyzing of extracted evidential data to make a conclusion about an incident 
that occurred in the IoNT environment. The massive amount of data in the IoNT 
needs new processing and analysis tools and techniques to deal with these data in 
a timely fashion and forensically sound manner.
	
5.	Examination: In the examination phase, an investigator inspects the data and 
their characteristics. In this phase, we expect to develop new tools to examine 
digital evidence that extract from nano-things such as bio-things and multimedia 
nano-things.

6.	Report: The final phase of the digital forensic process is to make an organized 
report about findings to present in a court of law. There is a challenge in IoNTF 
to present these types of digital evidence that the jury may have less knowledge 
about.
7.3.4  Opportunities
There are many sources which will help digital practitioners to identify valuable infor-
mation about IoNT-related crimes. These locations and sources include all hardware and 
software in IoNT environment. Studying IoT forensics will help reduce the complexity and 
challenges in performing IoNTF in a timely fashion and forensically sound manner. There 
are some solutions proposed in Balasubramaniam and Kangasharju (2013) to make data 
collection possible in an IoNT environment; these solutions may help the investigators and 
examiners understand how to collect evidential data related to an incident or crime in an 
efficient and effective manner. The challenges and proposed solutions are presented in 
Table 7.1.
7.4  IoNTF Investigation Model
This section introduces an IoNTF investigation model for assisting and supporting reli-
able digital forensics investigations in the IoNT environment. From the above ­definition of 
IoNTF, we identify that the digital investigation process in the IoNT could be done in three 
digital forensics levels as follows:
	
1.	Nanodevice forensics level
	
2.	Internet forensics level
	
3.	IoNT services/application forensics level

A high ratio of nanosensors to microgateways 
could lead to swift energy depletion if 
microgateways must process information 
from every nanosensor.
Distribute the sink architecture and develop 
a two-layered hierarchy consisting of 
microgateways and nanonetworks.
Routing 
technology
Molecular nanonetworks: Information-
carrying molecules could move very slowly 
between nodes as well as become lost.
Opportunistic routing through multihop 
relays of nanodevices; base the topology on 
random or unstructured graphs.
EM nanonetworks: Limited memory, 
computational power, and energy will 
constrain data transmission between nodes.
Single-hop transmission to microgateways 
through a star topology; incorporate 
query-based routing, with queries routed 
between microgateways.
With only one microgateway per 
nanonetwork, bulk data transmission 
could be difficult.
Incorporate unconventional routing 
technologies such as mobile delay-tolerant 
networks to carry bulk data.

Internet of Things (IoT)
The proposed IoNTF investigation model that can be adopted to investigate crimes 
related to IoNT is shown in Figure 7.12. This model consists of four main phases, namely 
identification of digital evidence, data collection and acquisition, data analysis and exami-
nation, and finally reporting and presentation of a summary of the entire ­investigation 
process.
7.5  Conclusion and Future Directions
Recently, the advanced development of IoNT to provide new services and applications 
in several areas such as manufacturing, health care, industry, military, multimedia, and 
agriculture prompted attackers to launch new types of crimes and attacks against IoNT 
infrastructure. The new types of severe attacks are increasing against nanodevices and 
nanonetworks. Therefore, there is a serious need for developing new digital forensic 
procedures and techniques to prevent and trace these types of attacks in a timely and 
forensically sound manner. This chapter systematically presented the challenges and 
opportunities for the IoNTF field as well as the IoNTF investigation model for assisting 
and supporting reliable digital forensics in the IoNT environment. Some of the future 
directions in this innovation area can be summarized as:
•	 Develop and implement the proposed IoNTF model with real case studies.
•	 Study and solve IoNTF challenges that can open the opportunity for ­identifying 
numerous new insights that were not possible before.
•	 Development of new practical forensic tools and procedures to facilitate forensic 
examinations of the IoNTF.
•	 Apply data analytic methods for various types of forensic data collection from 
IoNT environments.

Internet of Things (IoT)
8.1  Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a subject of much attention these days. IoT is all about vari-
ous devices or anything with embedded sensors that can be interconnected and communi-
cated. These devices acquire intelligence and can respond well on the stipulated scenario. 
Active research is being carried out in every dimension of this field to handle the demand 
and challenges of the vendor. It includes architecture, platform interoperability, commu-
nication, security, sensor data analytics, and cognitive computing. The advancement in 
technology is to serve the society. IoT has a wide range of applications from health care to 
industry where the solutions are brought to people to help deal with chaos in their daily 
lives. This chapter focuses on how IoT devices are used for assisted living.
IoT is a technology trend which produces trillions of data through connecting multiple 
devices and sensors with the cloud and business intelligence tools. It is thus causing a 
large number and distinct types of products to emit colossal amount of data at a phenom-
enal rate. According to Manyika et al. (2013) in Global Institute report, IoT is one of the 12 
technologies that can bring huge economic transformations and have a massive impact on 
life, business, and the global economy in the coming years. The report further states that it 
can make a potential economic impact of around $3 trillion to $6 trillion by 2025. Similarly, 
Gartner predicts that the IoT market is going to bloom in the years to come. It is estimated 
to generate $300 billion in revenue by 2020, with an assessment of connecting devices 
ranging from 25 billion to more than 200 billion. These connecting devices need sensors, 
networks, back-end infrastructure, and analytics software to extract useful information 
from the data produced.
Advancement in wireless communication technology and improved quality services 
made it possible to collect data from the sensors installed at different locations which can 
be collected any time. Still, the IoT is in an evolutionary stage and its widespread adoption 
will take time to mature. However, it is the time for company decision makers to under-
stand the potential impact of IoT and its robust future prospects. Precisely, the IoT is the 
network of devices and sensors, which we use in our daily life; and the data it produces, 
gathers, stores, and processes help to make the right decisions for a business to be more 
productive and successful.
8.2  Introduction to AAL
As the life expectancy of humans has increased due to rapid growth of health care, 
the average life span is increased to around 70 years. In this scenario, the longevity 
and health issues in old age pressurize caregivers to provide continuous support to 
the aged in their day-to-day activities. Rapid growth in technology transformation can 
empower them by using sensor-based IoT devices that facilitate to overcome chaos in 
their daily lives and allow them to feel comfortable and independent. AAL consists 
of technical systems, infrastructure, and services to support elderly people to have an 
independent lifestyle through seamless integration of automated home appliances and 
its communicating devices. These solutions ensure the safety and security of the person 
who is being continuously monitored in the background by software systems and smart 
­sensors with good ­connected network.

141
Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
Numerous such applications have been developed to significantly improve the quality of 
life. Some of them are listed below.
•	 Smart homes that can monitor the home environment and human behavior
•	 Tracking the health of an individual by monitoring blood pressure, ECG, oxygen 
intake, weight, and food intake
•	 Emergency response with GPRS to locate loved ones
•	 Pain-care system that can electronically locate pain and accurately report its 
­intensity to the physician
•	 Enabling people to sleep well by playing soothing music, with the option of 
­changing the sound track by merely shaking the phone
•	 Sensors can also record the sleeping frequency and report abnormalities, if any
•	 Increasing the memory of the elderly and detecting disorders like Alzheimers
•	 Rehabilitation for specially abled people
•	 One touch solution in clinical care, nursing, health care, home care, and other 
­services that is required for daily activities
Most of the applications concentrate on activity recognition, mobility of the person, and 
monitoring of changes in their environment. The functions of these applications also 
include tracking health records and medications, locating new friends, enhancing mental 
sharpness, and providing soothing music for users to sleep.
8.3  Sensors and Devices for AAL
It is long since IoT started its journey, and the objective of AAL is to apply technology 
and communication to assist the elderly to lead an independent and well-connected life. 
A wide range of sensors are available for this purpose like those monitoring a person’s 
activity, reading environment conditions, assessing a person’s behavior response, and 
ensuring their health care. Sensors are connected to a network, and wireless communica-
tions exchange the data recorded between heterogeneous nodes. Sensors’ reliability, min-
iaturization, power economy, network capability, and cognitive computing have moved 
the research of AAL and their usage to be part of our daily life.
Some of the basic categories of the sensors are wearable, dense, and sparse sensors. 
Wearable sensors are integrated with some devices or other materials that we wear the 
whole day. These sensor signals are in contact with our body to recognize the human char-
acteristics like temperature and activities like walking, sleeping, falling, and also other 
movements. The difficultly here will be the viability of such devices and the adaptability 
of people to such devices. However, the dense sensors can be placed externally at different 
places in the house to capture any movement and to monitor the environmental changes at 
the residence. The sensors used for this purpose include RFID, accelerometers, and those 
that enable acoustic and motion capturing. Sparse sensors are placed at particular places at 
home. It is used for behavioral recognition using probabilistic or fuzzy analysis.
Figure 8.1 indicates that the sensors could respond at different intervals for ­monitoring 
activity on monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or minute basis. There are also indicators that 

142
Internet of Things (IoT)
could respond immediately and are in continuous monitoring every ­second. Urgent response 
will be helpful in abnormal activities, especially in the case of emergency. Table 8.1 shows 
selection criteria for sensors based on the requirements of the living environment. These 
sensors can be chosen based on the necessity, activity for which it is installed, and its effi-
ciency and strength.
8.3.1  Fall Detection
This is one of the primary and the most basic requirement in AAL. The elderly are excep-
tionally fragile and because of diminished elements of the nerve frameworks, or due to 
age-related maladies, they frequently are dependent, slow to respond, and confused. This 
increases the danger of falls resulting in wounds. Frequently, the elderly aren’t aware that 
they have fallen and require help. They may lie on the floor for quite a long time without 
help, and in numerous cases this could lead to a long drawn out bout of hospitalization or 
treatment, and now and then even to death. A ton of exertion has been focused on making 
a fall identifier that would trigger an alert on the occasion of a fall. The primary prerequi-
sites for the equipment and programming execution of such a fall locator are:
•	 Not to miss the occasion of a fall, that is, high affectability
•	 To minimize the quantity of false-positive cautions (the enlistment of a fall when 
there is no fall), that is, high specificity
The principal prerequisite is coherent as the point of a fall locator in the perfect case is to 
enlist the falls, that occur. In addition, as the fall could bring about a state of defenseless-
ness or even debilitation, a quick response to such occasions is very important. In the 
second case, a high number of false-positive alerts could trade-off between the framework 
and the decrease of acknowledgment by the end clients. Diverse creators utilize distinctive 
calculations and sensors to recognize the fall. The regularly utilized sensors are:
•	 Gyroscopes or accelerometers (Bagnasco et al. 2011; Bourke et al. 2010; Kangas 
et al. 2008; Klenk et al. 2011; Li et al. 2009; Luštrek et al. 2009)

Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
•	 Cameras-static or wearables (Rougier et al. 2011; Tabar et al. 2006)
•	 Combination of several strategies (Grassi et al. 2010)
In spite of all the examinations devoted to fall recognition, there isn’t a 100% solid calcula-
tion that captures all falls without issuing false cautions.
8.3.2  Activity Classification
The goal of this classification is to develop classifiers to recognize human activities and 
exercises. The distinction between activity and action is that activity is a basic develop-
ment or change in the stance of the client (e.g., gets up, lies, and strolls), while movement 
could be a mix of a few activities speaking to a complex, more elevated amount of reflec-
tion, for example, cooking, cleaning, and eating. Distinctive machine learning strategies 
are used for activity classification (Jalal et al. 2011).

Internet of Things (IoT)
8.3.3  Location Tracking
Area tracking is an imperative segment of a teleobserving framework, particularly for 
people with any shade of dysfunctional behavior or dementia, for example, Alzheimer 
sickness. Distinctive methodologies for handy acknowledgment exist (Schindhelm et al. 
2011), some of which utilizes:
•	 Identification of radio frequency
•	 Cameras
•	 Multimodal approaches
8.3.4  Telemonitoring of Vital-Parameters
Teleobserving is an imperative part of the well-being administrations in AAL. Parameters, 
for example, heartbeat, pulse rate, blood oxygen immersion, and ECG, are observed 
(De Capua et al. 2010). Most often the sensors are wearable; however, this may affect the 
convenience of the clients. That is the reason endeavors are engaged on creating other 
method for getting the key parameter’s value.
8.3.5  Wireless Sensors Networks
Remote sensor systems are a fundamental segment of the AAL frameworks. Every wearable 
sensor in the framework is bound to be battery-fueled and transmits information remotely. 
Other environmental sensors and gadgets are likely to transmit their ­information to a 
remote server. There are a few entrenched remote norms, for example, Bluetooth, ZigBee, 
and WiFi (IEEE 802.11), which are generally utilized as a part of AAL frameworks. A con-
siderable measure of research has been directed to the field of WSN; however, issues, for 
example, movement improvement, arrange administration, security and unwavering qual-
ity, are yet to be completely explored and established (Lopez et al. 2011).
8.3.6  Innovative User Interface Development
A few segments of complicated AAL frameworks may be intuitive, for example, in an infor-
mal organization the client ought to have the capacity to impart and set up the framework. 
Given that the elderly are frequently hesitant to utilize PCs, a few novel interfaces ought 
to be created which are more qualified for their specialized information and ­capacities 
(Aghajan et al. 2010).
Some of such interfaces are:
•	 Computer brain interface
•	 Recognition of gesture
•	 Recognition of speech
•	 Touchscreen
8.3.7  Behavior Determination
It is centered on building a behavioral profile of the client and observing whether there are 
deviations from the model. Behavioral assurance and areas following it are vital parts of

the client’s standard life. The target of the behavioral frameworks is to distinguish atypical 
conduct which may be created by diminished well-being status, and advancing ailment or 
crisis circumstance (Chung and Liu 2008).
8.4  Wearable Sensors for AAL
The following figures depict some of the wearable devices used for assisting and moni-
toring the elderly. Figure 8.2 shows the sensor woven in a cloth for recording the tem-
perature. It is a smart temperature sensing textile (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology 
Zürich, Electronics Laboratory—Wearable Computing). Figure 8.3 is a patch used for dia-
betics sensing and to give therapy based on the readings. Graphene-based electrochemical

device is used as a patch with thermo-responsive micro-needles for monitoring blood level 
glucose and delivers medication through micro needle. (Hui Won Yun, Seoul National 
University).
Smart wrist band (Figure 8.4) is used to measure pulse rate and calories burning 
throughout the day. It has OLED display for text and calendar notifications. It can track 
the duration and quality of sleep and wake you up with a silent vibrating alarm. Overall, 
it can monitor the fitness level to improve and personalize cardio fitness score with per-
sonalized breathing sessions based on one’s heart rate. Figure 8.5 shows a remote and 
digital ECG monitoring system. The ECG signals are sent to remote devices from which 
analytics are possible through distributed and parallel computing. Figure 8.6 shows the 
sleep tracker that can even record even minute movements during sleep. The broad strip 
is placed below the bed and a comfortable wrist-based sleep monitoring device is set 
up for sleep detection. It works based on the LED light at the bed-side unit which is 
passed through fiber optic cables. When the measure of light supply is lost, it indicates 
the movement of the person in the bed.
Another dimension of this is independent living which is adopted for smart route 
­planning, concerning mobility, orientation, and intelligent guidance for indoor and out-
door environments. It is useful in public buildings such as hospitals, museums, offices, 
shopping malls, and for pedestrians and transportation. AAL has also given a solution

for the specially abled persons in performing their day-to-day chores. A smart interactive 
­system has been developed for rehabilitation of neuro-cognitive disorder. Systems that use 
ontologism and analytics gains knowledge will be rational in making decisions.
8.5  AAL Architecture
This section discusses the system architecture adopted by some applications. Every sys-
tem has actuators and sensors that perform actions and recognizes the environment, 
respectively. Through different types of sensors and camera, data are acquired and trans-
mitted through wired or wireless networks. IoT systems manage everything from data 
acquisition to protocols used for communication. Data packets transmission, filtering,

Internet of Things (IoT)
synchronization, and processing are carried out in every sensor. The generated data from 
the environment is applied for processing. To derive intelligence from the data some of the 
machine learning techniques or analytics is performed based on which rational decisions 
can be made. The feedback of the decision is studied by the caregivers or the doctors based 
on which further actions will be taken. Figure 8.8 shows the processes that are carried out 
at different levels.
AAL systems that work for emergency treatment are rigidly time constrained. These 
systems should be accurate with early prediction of abnormalities which are of concern 
for human safety. The system developed by Benghazi has time trace semantic technique 
methodology based on UML–RT model. With this model, one can develop a complex 
AAL system designed through UML-RT constructs represented graphically by software 
engineers (Benghazhi et al. 2012). It also provides a set of transformation rules for speci-
fication in the formal language that can be used for verification. Figure 8.9 shows the 
communication between the smart home care system and the caretaker or the hospital. 
The sensor data are recorded and communicated to the server of the home care system 
either through wired or wireless transmission or through local or Internet connections.
The server communicates the emergency message to the hospital with the details of the 
patient. Thus, persons left alone can be treated in emergency through smart IoT systems 
that could monitor them continuously.
Communication plays a vital role in AAL for immediate response for assisting elderly 
people. Wireless communication technologies have developed to a greater extent and sat-
isfy the requirements of the applications of AAL. Figure 8.10 shows various communica-
tion standards with their range varying from smaller to a larger distance and strength. 
It also supports the limited and full mobility and their operating strength based on the 
range. Protocols such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, and ultra-wide band suit for a smaller range of 
communication. However, Wifi and Wifi max can be used for a wide range of communica-
tion that can cover up to an entire city. Protocols such as GSM, GPRS, EDGE, and HSOPA 
can be used for communicating across the region, country, etc.

Micro Electro and Mechanical (MEMS) devices integrate the sensors, and mechanical 
and electronic elements on a chip using micro-fabrication technology. MEMS play a cru-
cial role in integration, sensor, communication, storage, and computational capability on a 
single chip thereby reducing the size of the wearable device with sophisticated facilities in 
a small device that can be worn with no disturbances. These sensors are reliable and can 
also work on low power consumption (WSN 2009).
The architecture in Figure 8.11 consists of data acquisition, model to understand the 
state of the person at any instance of time and handling timely activity to make decisions. 
It includes hardware and software functional systems. Hardware system includes vari-
ous sensors fixed at different places for various purposes. Device drivers are installed at

the base stations for the management of the sensors. These sensors are interconnected by 
wireless communication in the base station and connected to the remote places through 
3G modem (Botia et al. 2012). It maintains the communication from small range to larger 
range using different protocols mentioned in Figure 8.10.
8.6  Analytics in IoT
Sensor, mobile, and wireless technologies are driving the evolution of the IoT. The 
true business value of the IoT lies in analytics rather than hardware novelties. The first 
thing to understand about analytics on IoT data is that it involves datasets generated by 
­sensors, which are now cheap and sophisticated to support a seemingly endless variety 
of use cases.
The potential of sensors lies in their ability to gather data about the physical environ-
ment, which can be analyzed or combined with other forms of data to detect patterns.
8.6.1  The IoT Analytics in Health Care
The IoTA in health care encompasses heterogeneous computing, wireless communication 
systems, and applications and devices that help patients and providers for monitoring, 
tracking, and storing patients’ vital statistics or medical information. Examples of such 
systems are smart meters, RFID, wearable health monitoring sensors, and smart video 
cameras. Also, smart phones, intelligent vehicles, and robotics are considered to be part

of IoT. These IoT devices produce enormous amounts of data which become a challenge 
for providers to deal with efficiently. To harness this huge data in a technological way and 
make sense of it, IoTA is implemented. Data mining, data management, and data analyt-
ics techniques are used to make this deluge of data useful and also to extract medically 
relevant information. In fact, it has been predicted that by 2017 more than 50% of analyt-
ics techniques will make a better use of this influx of data generated from instrumented 
machines and applications.
In the United States, physicians and other providers are using new wireless technolo-
gies to monitor patients remotely for early detection of health problems and for timely 
recovery. The influx of data from Internet-connected devices is a valuable source for health 
systems. The analytics empowers caregivers to optimize it fully in order to provide better 
care, cut down costs, and to reduce other inefficiencies in health care.
8.6.2  Transforming Health Care with the IoT
In the US health care industry, the small and big health care organizations are using the 
IoT tools and devices that are revolutionizing medical care in unique ways. IoT devices 
range from headsets that measure brainwaves to clothes that include sensing devices, 
Google Glass, BP monitors, etc. All these have moved personal health monitoring system 
to the next level.
According to ABI Research, in 2016 the sale of wireless wearable medical devices will 
bloom and the sales will reach more than 100 million devices annually. Another report 
by IMS Research—the research partner of wearable technologies—states that the devices 
which are wearable works in close proximity with the human body and produces more 
realistic results. There has been clinical evidence that the physiological data received from 
wireless devices has been a valuable contributor for managing and preventing chronic 
diseases and monitoring patients post hospitalization. As a result, a growing number of 
medical devices are becoming wearable nowadays, including glucose monitors, ECG mon-
itors, pulse oximeters, blood pressure monitors, and so on.
The market for wearable technologies in health care is expected to exceed $2.9 billion in 
2016. The IoT enables health organizations to achieve superior technology interoperabil-
ity, gather critical data from multiple sources in real time, and a better decision-­making 
­capability. This trend transforms the health care sector by increasing its efficiency, ­lowering 
costs, and providing better performance in patient care.
8.6.3  IoT—A Health-Care Game Changer
The IoT has already brought in significant changes in many areas of health care. It is 
rapidly changing the health care scenario by focusing on the way people, devices, and 
applications are connected and interact with each other. IoT is emerging as the most 
promising information and communication technology (ICT) solution which enables 
providers to improve health care outcomes and reduce health care costs by flawlessly 
collecting, recording, analyzing, and sharing myriads of new data streams in real 
time. Moreover, as the widespread adoption of IoT grows, many of the inefficiencies in 
health care will be reduced. For example, sensors embedded in medical devices such as 
diagnostic equipment, drug-dispensing systems, surgical robots, implantable devices, 
and personal health and fitness sensors will perform data collection and measure-
ments, and conduct tests digitally in no time which are currently administered and 
recorded manually.

152
Internet of Things (IoT)
This is extremely important for gaining new insights and knowledge on various issues 
in health care. For example, to study a patient’s response to a specific therapy or drugs, 
traditionally, health care providers study different samples taken from the patients. These 
samples sometimes are not up to the required standard to derive a clear conclusion. But, 
the IoT has made it possible for the first time to collect real-time data from unlimited num-
ber of patients for a definite period of time through connecting devices. It is anticipated 
that it will also improve health care services for people in remote locations as monitoring 
systems provide a continuous stream of data that enables health care providers to make 
better decisions. IoT is gaining momentum among health care providers and the IT sector 
in emerging as a major technology trend for improved health care.
8.6.4  The Future of IoT in Health Care
According to market researchers like Gartner and McKinsey, the IoT will “add $1.9 ­trillion 
to the global economy by 2020,” or it will have a “potential impact of $2.7 to $6.2 ­trillion by 
2025.” This shows that the market for IoT is rising and gaining popularity in the United 
States, especially after President Obama’s comments on health care industry that the 
“nation should create a Smart Manufacturing infrastructure and approaches that leads 
operators make real-time use of ‘big data’ flows from fully instrumented plants.”
IoT has been identified as one of the fast emerging technologies in IT according to Gartner‘s 
IT Hype Cycle which shows the emergence, adoption, and maturity of specific technolo-
gies, and their impact on applications. It has been predicted that it will take 5–10 years for 
a widespread market adoption of IoT. The IoT revolution which has arrived in health care 
and medicine is making a strong impact on health care systems worldwide. New types of 
sensor technology, rapidly growing data analytics, and the new health care structures are 
formed due to the outbreak of IoT. The health IoT has a tremendous potential to create a 
more revolutionary archetype for health care industry if developed on a privacy/security 
model. In addition, it will have a major impact on health economy in the near future.
8.7  Stages of Transforming Raw Data into Meaningful Analytics
Understanding the tools and data acquisition from IoT devices, analysts need to transform 
data into the required format to infer knowledge from it. Any type of data, including 
health care data, goes through three stages before an analyst can use it to achieve sustain-
able, meaningful analytics which is shown in Figure 8.12.
	
1.	Data capture
	
2.	Data provisioning
	
3.	Data analysis
Stage 1: Data Capture
An analyst’s job is impacted by the way people, processes, and devices produce and cap-
ture data. These three entities are responsible for the appropriateness of the data—did 
they capture the right stuff? discreteness—did they capture it in the right format? and ease 
of data extraction—was the data captured in an accessible way?
www.ebook3000.com

153
Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
Stage 2: Data Provisioning
Analysts need data from multiple source systems throughout the organization to produce 
meaningful insights. For example, an analyst assisting a team of clinicians on a quality 
improvement issue needs a variety of data from multiple source systems:
•	 EMR data (for clinical observations and lab results)
•	 Billing data (for identifying cohorts using diagnosis and procedure codes, charges, 
and revenue)
•	 Cost data (for determining the improvements’ impact on margins)
•	 Patient satisfaction data
Aggregating data manually—pulling all of the data into one location in a common for-
mat and ensuring datasets are linked to each other (through common linkable identifiers 
such as patient and provider identifiers)—is extremely time-consuming. It also makes data 
more susceptible to errors. There are more effective ways to gather data.
Stage 3: Data Analysis
The data analysis starts after the appropriate data have been captured, pulled into a single 
place, and tied together. The analysis process consists of several parts:
•	 Data quality evaluation: Analysts need to understand the data by taking time to 
evaluate the same. They also need to note their method of evaluation with the 
reference when they share their findings with the audience.
•	 Data discovery: Before attempting to answer a specific question, analysts should take 
time to explore the data and look for meaningful oddities and trends. It is a critical

component of good data analysis. In my experience, more than 50% of acted-upon 
analyses resulted from stumbling upon something in the discovery process.
•	 Interpretation: Most people think of the interpretation step when they think about 
analyzing data, but it’s actually the smallest sub-step in a long process in terms of 
the time analysts spend on it.
•	 Presentation: Presentation is critical. After all the work for getting data to this 
point, the analyst needs to tell a story with the data in a consumable, simple way 
that caters to the audience. Presentation principles need to be considered.
These three stages of insightful data analysis will drive improvements. Each step alone, 
however, is not enough to create sustainable and meaningful health care analytics. It’s 
equally important to empower data analysts to focus on analyzing data, not just capturing 
and provisioning data.
8.8  Common Health-Care Analytics Solutions and Their Pitfalls
Many health systems opt to implement one of the following three types of analytics solu-
tions. Although these solutions may initially show promise, they inevitably fall short of 
expectations.
8.8.1  Point Solutions
When developing an analytics platform, some health systems deploy one or more best-
of-breed or point solutions. These applications focus on a single goal and a single slic-
ing of the data. For example, the solution might focus solely on reducing surgical site 
infections or central-line-associated blood infections. One problem with this approach 
is something called sub-optimization. While the organization may be able to optimize 
the specific area of focus, these point solutions can have negative impacts both upstream 
and downstream. They also don’t offer much in the way of insight outside of the specific 
area of focus.
Another problem is what is called the “technology spaghetti bowl.” When a hospital 
or group practice has only a few point solutions in its dish, a small IT shop can provide 
adequate support. But with additional point solutions (consider them noodles, if you will), 
an IT department finds it all but impossible to unravel all the disparate noodles in the 
spaghetti bowl. Imagine there are 10 different point solutions, and it’s necessary to update 
coding standards from multiple source systems in each of these point solutions. You’ll end 
up with sauce on your face by the time you’re done.
Eventually, one or two of the senior IT employees may own this spaghetti bowl mess 
with a huge dependency placed on these individuals, creating an unstable house built out 
of playing cards. While this situation works well initially, if either of the individuals leaves 
the organization, then the house of cards will crumble, leaving a mess for someone else to 
clean up.
In addition, point solutions typically result in multiple contracts, multi-cost ­dependencies, 
and multiple interfaces. These, in turn, lead to complexity, confusion, and organizational 
chaos that impede improvement and continued success.

Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
8.8.2  Electronic Health Record System
Implementing an electronic health record (EHR) is clearly a necessary step toward data-
driven care delivery, and an EHR system alone is insufficient to enable an enterprise-wide, 
consistent view of data from multiple sources. The conversion of clinical data from paper 
to an electronic format is a necessary step—it allows for the use of data to improve care. 
However, without a way of organizing all sources—clinical, financial, patient satisfaction, 
and administrative data—into a single source of truth, a health care organization is unable 
to harness the analytic power of the data. Some EHR vendors are beginning to come 
out with data warehouse offerings that run on top of the EHR’s transactional database. 
However, these data warehouses still have the limitation that they don’t aggregate data 
from a variety of external sources—because the vendor can’t or won’t. Some EHR vendors 
are becoming willing to integrate some external data, but they are years behind analytics 
vendors in terms of their performance.
8.8.3  Independent Data Marts in Different Databases
Independent data marts that live in different databases throughout a health system pro-
vide limited analytics capabilities because they can only deliver little sources of truth from 
the different soiled systems. Take, for example, the ADT (admission, discharge, transfer) 
information that lives in the EMR. When there’s a need to analyze the ADT information 
and the role it plays on costs, analysts move the data over to the costing system with the 
independent data mart model. Requests like this one can happen over and over for many 
different types of scenarios, which ends up becoming time-consuming. It also slows down 
the entire system as analysts repetitiously bombard the system with requests for each new 
use case.
8.9  Ambient Intelligence for AAL
The research on Aml was initiated by European Commission in 2001 (I.A. Group 2001). 
Aml is characterized by sensitivity, responsivity, adaptability, transparency, ubiquity and 
intelligence. It’s interaction with other technologies is shown in Figure 8.13.
The project PERSONA named after PERceptive Space prOmoting iNdependent Aging 
was developed with a scalable open standard platform to building wired range of appli-
cations in AAL. It has an efficient infrastructure with self-organizing middleware tech-
nology having extensibility of components or device ensembles. The components of this 
system communicate with each other based on the distributed coordination strategies 
using PERSONA middleware. It has different types of communication buses: input, out-
put, context, and service buses that enable interoperability with different components 
using middleware. The middleware of PERSONA was implemented using the OSGi plat-
form with communication through UPnp, Bluetooth, and R-OSGi. In this model, vari-
ous reasoning algorithms are adopted for modeling, activity prediction and recognition, 
­decision-making, and spatial temporal reasoning (Cook et al. 2009).
Modeling—it deals with the design that separates the computing and user interaction. 
This can customize the Aml software toward user requirement. These models have capa-
bility of recognizing the changes and adopting itself based on the changes in the patterns. 

156
Internet of Things (IoT)
Modeling can be classified based on the data used to build the model, type of model built, 
and algorithms used for nature of model building (Cook et al. 2009).
Activity prediction and recognition—different type of sensors can recognize different 
activities. It is based on the user requirement and the type of sensors used in the applica-
tion for recognizing various activities. Figure 8.14 recognizes falling of a person. Table 8.1 
shows the different sensors and the activity that it can recognize.
Activity model—different machine learning algorithms are applied to understand the 
activity and to adapt to the changes based on the behavioral patterns. The pattern recogni-
tion can be in batch processing or steam data or can be for conditional patterns. Probabilistic 
models, neural network, and fuzzy models are some of the techniques applied for activity 
recognition.

Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
Decision-making—Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning can be applied for the daily 
activity data and also on the complete task recorded earlier for deriving any conclusion. 
This type of analysis on previously recorded data will facilitate in recognizing and deci-
sion-making in emergency situations. The following is an example for deriving knowledge 
from the rule generated.
Subject(?x) ∧Location (?x, ?y) ∧MovementSensor(?s) ∧detectMovement(?, true) ∧inside(?s,?r) 
∧HabitableSpaceInBuilding(?r) ∧haveConnection(?r,?c) ∧connectinWith(?c,?c1) ∧equal(?y,?c1) 
⇒state(?x, Active) ∧location(?x,?r)
Spatial temporal reasoning—the spatial characteristics and temporal behavior of sensor 
data give additional information about an activity. For example, after, before, meets, over-
lapped, started by, finishes, and during are some of the temporal relationships. Some of these 
will be required for medication in health care while suggesting pills right after food, before 
food, etc. Capturing these characteristics require special techniques and algorithms. The 
algorithm, Jakkula’s TempAI recognizes nine intervals with such temporal relationship used 
for prediction (Jakkula et al. 2007). Figure 8.15 states the temporal relationships such as before, 
contains, overlaps, meets, and visualization of two activities X and Y with respect to time.
8.10  Software Engineering Approach for AAL Systems
Probabilistic Symbolic Model Checker (PRISM) is a tool used to build AAL system based 
on dependability analysis (Kwiatkowska et al. 2004). This tool is highly successful for the 
reason that it uses various probabilistic models like discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs), 
continuous time markov chains (CTMCs), and Markov decision process (MDP). It can also 
derive model based on state-based language reactive model ­formalisms. This tool also uses 
temporal logic like Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL) (Rodrigues et al. 2012).

Analyzing  the  AAL system development with dependability as a function of reliabil-
ity involves the following eight steps to assure qualitative and ­quantitative dependability 
analysis.
	
a.	Specify UML behavior models
	
b.	Annotate the models.
	
c.	Convert to PRISM language.
	
d.	Compile and check PRISM model.
	
e.	Simulate the model.
	
f.	Define the properties for dependability.
	
g.	Run the properties.
	
h.	Analyze the result.
Steps d to step h use PRISM tool to compose the dependability analysis. Every activity 
is modeled after the UML activity diagram (AD). It consists of decision and action nodes, 
each representing the execution scenarios as a sequence diagram. Once the ADs and SDs 
are completed, the next step is to build the annotation with reliability components and 
transition probabilities. The assumptions of the reliability of the components are based 
on (i) the reliability of the services performed where the execution time of the invocation 
is not considered as a factor, (ii) state of transition which depends on the source state, and 
the available transition and its transfer of control between the components is estimated 
through Markov Chain property, and (iii) failures of the transition.
An example of annotation in PRISM with component reliability is as follows and shown 
in Figure 8.16.

To ensure whether the system is working properly, software design is very essential which 
is set before it gets developed. Besides the functional requirements defined through activ-
ity and sequence diagram, it also requires nonfunctional requirements to assure the qual-
ity of the system developed. AAL systems require activities that are time constrained and 
critical. To ensure the nonfunctional requirements of the system, Benghazi et al. (2012) has 
modeled a design based on UML-RT that uses timed traces semantic and methodology 
to check the timeliness and safety of AAL activity. Petri Nets is used as tool for modeling 
semantic and interactive graphical language to develop and verify nonfunctional require-
ments of the system (Hein et al. 2009; Palanque et al. 2007). Benghazi has used formal 
language CSP+T for defining the timed traces semantics of the operations. CSP+T is the 
subset of CSP developed by Hoare in 1985. Let P and Q be a process that has defined a set 
of events Σ with a ∈ ∑ and B ⊆ ∑ in a time interval [t,t+T].

by a predefined protocol and interaction between actors and the system. The following 
­procedure is applied recursively for the subsystem.
	
1.	Its architecture is defined by UML-RT context diagram
	
2.	Its internal structure is described by composite structure diagrams
	
3.	For each component in the subsystem
	
a.	 if the component is composite, then jump to step i
	
b.	 else, if the component is basic, then capture its timed behavior by timed state 
diagram (Benghazi et al. 2012).
Figure 8.17 shows an example model setup using MEDISTAM_RT. It consists of two cap-
sules C1 and C2 for which activity is defined. The system also considers the temporal con-
sistency of the basic capsules and their protocols for coordination between them through 
message passing. Thus, the behavior of the ports (edges of communication point) deter-
mines the pattern of interaction in time-constrained message passing to the environment.
8.11  Cognitive AAL
Cognitive architecture uses a distributed intelligent system for controlling and decision-
making of an ambient intelligence system (Peter Ivanov et al. 2015). Neurodegenerative 
diseases (Antonio Coronato and Giuseppe De Pietro 2012) are progressive and very hard to 
diagnose in its early stages. Progressive impairment in the activities of daily living, as well

as cognitive deterioration, leads to an increase in patient dependency. Neuropsychiatric 
symptoms are common features and include psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), 
depressive mood, anxiety, irritability/lability, apathy, euphoria, dis-inhibition, agitation/
aggression, aberrant motor activities, sleep disturbance, and eating disorder (Segal-Gidan 
et al. 2011). In particular, cognitive impaired patients need constant monitoring to ensure 
their well-being and that they do not harm themselves. Additionally, they have a tendency 
to wander and misplace objects. Situation awareness requires the environment be able 
to analyze the behavior of patients with cognitive impairments, which is extremely chal-
lenging. Indeed, traditional behavioral and situation analysis techniques assume “ratio-
nal” behaviors, in the sense that behaviors are led by clear goals, and rely on matching 
the observed activities with predefined behavioral patterns (Ye et al. 2012). The cognitive 
sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s, called the cognitive revolution, 
arguably initiated by Noam Chomsky. Cognitive science is mainly concerned with artifi-
cial intelligence, attention, knowledge and processing of language, learning and develop-
ment, memory, perception and action, and consciousness.
Cognitive AAL is a cognitive development and function involving conscious intellectual 
activity to support the elderly with their daily activities in order to help them be healthy 
and safe while living independently. However, most current systems are ineffective in 
actual situation, difficult to use, and have a low acceptance rate. There is a need for an 
intelligent assisted living solution and also to resolve practical issues such as user accep-
tance and usability in order to truly assist the elderly. Small, inexpensive, and low-powered

Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
consumption sensors are now available which can be used in assisted living applications 
to provide sensitive and responsive services based on users’ current environments and 
situations.
Many activity recognition systems are developed for assisted living. The three major 
requirements for an assisted living system which need to be met in order to fulfill its 
purpose and potential to assist vulnerable people are: (1) High acceptance: system needs 
to be ambient and unobtrusive. (2) Adaptation: able to adapt to changing situations or 
abilities of the individual and environment to satisfy individual needs. (3) High usability: 
services must be provided in an accessible way (Kleinberger et al. (2007). The three char-
acteristics can be viewed from two perspectives, namely practical and technical aspects. 
The aim of the practical aspect is to satisfy the needs in term of practicality, that is, high 
usability and acceptance. Several studies on perceptions toward assisted living tech-
nology (Chernbumroong et al. 2010; Demiris et al. 2004, 2008) have identified concerns 
arising from the use of technology for elderly care such as user acceptance, system cost, 
usability, and privacy issues. For example, a system which requires users to wear special 
equipment may be perceived as too complicated to use, resulting in low acceptance. In a 
mobility-aided system (Yu et al. 2003), for example, the user interface is a critical require-
ment as it has direct physical interaction with the users. An interview-based investigation 
by Demiris et al. (2004, 2008) also showed that the elderly were concerned about privacy 
violation, visibility, and accuracy of the assisted living systems. Even if systems could 
deliver the best services for assisting people, unless they are easily accessible and usable 
and address the real needs and concerns of the users, they will not be accepted. The cost 
of assisted living systems is another important issue. For a practical solution in assisted 
living, the systems need to be cost-effective to make it affordable for the general popula-
tion, especially the elderly who may be on benefits or pensions. From a technical aspect, 
the aim is to enable assisted living systems to become intelligent in order to adaptively 
assist the elderly in changing a dynamic environment. Systems with such aims are also 
referred to as ambient intelligent systems or smart homes (Aarts 2004). Ambient intel-
ligence technology used in assisted living solutions can provide some hands-on support 
based on current user status to maintain elderly people’s independence, reducing the 
health care cost while increasing quality of life (Kleinberger et al. 2007). To offer intelli-
gent services, the key is to understand user environments such as surrounding tempera-
ture and users activities in order to provide adaptive assistance to users. In this study, we 
are interested in understanding the user’s current activities which are often referred to as 
activity recognition.
AAL is a new and extending zone of research concentrating on the arrangement of in-
home care, that is, unimportant for patients requiring support with day-by-day exercises. 
AAL makes utilization of the most recent innovation and sensors accessible to give solid 
data. These data are focused at enhancing the level of care which the patient gets and 
empowering them to live inside their own home with least danger.
Dementia is likewise created by other subjective ailments, for example, Parkinson and 
Creutzfeldt–Jakob sicknesses. Dementia causes dynamic corruption of neurological proce-
dures related specifically to memory. Subsequently, patients can turn out to be effortlessly 
befuddled and their conduct can get to be distinctly eccentric. Because of the impacts new 
surroundings may have on a patient, it is desirable to keep the patient inside well-known 
surroundings for whatever length of time that is conceivable.
There are a few issues to consider when observing patients inside their own homes. The 
first and foremost reason is that observing ought to be encompassing and inconspicu-
ous. To encourage surrounding observing a few gadgets and sensors have been outlined. 

162
Internet of Things (IoT)
Metcalf et al. (2009) introduced a near survey of 30 diverse conductive yarns sewed utiliz-
ing two unique machine techniques. The utilization of such yarns is centered on measur-
ing strain and development in patients.
Agreeable wearable pieces of clothing give a subtle and compelling method for observ-
ing patients. Be that as it may, while checking patient's protection and the affectability of 
the information got from the sensors ought to be considered. Another approach to decide 
development is the utilization of accelerometers which measure changes in development. 
Slyper and Hodgins (2008) portrays the procedure of activity catch utilizing accelerom-
eters to copy developments performed by the subject utilizing movement. Accelerometers 
are greatly little, cheap, and generally inconspicuous. Five accelerometers are sewn into a 
shirt and associated utilizing conductive string. Doukas and Maglogiannis (2008) makes 
this one stride additionally laying out a framework which utilizes accelerometers and 
mouthpieces to recognize a fall in an aged people.
Virone et al. (2006) drew a model framework which utilizes a remote sensor system 
to screen a patient’s well-being continuously with a view to giving an ALL framework. 
The framework additionally keeps a total history of permitting approved clients, for exam-
ple, specialists or medical attendants, to perform remote discussion in light of the informa-
tion got. The framework utilizes both wearable and living space sensors to gather a wide 
range of data. Remote sensors are utilized to decrease the requirement for retrofitting. 
A caution framework portrayed has been (Giansanti 2008) looked into to screen epileptic 
emergency. This framework utilizes GPS and the GSM to send a caution message specify-
ing the patient’s area when an epileptic emergency happens.
A framework is proposed in Oregon health (2010) for distinguishing and checking the 
movement of dementia in patients. The framework plans to screen sensors situated in 
entryways and around the home. The thought is to endeavor to distinguish changes in 
memory and utilize these sensors. Comparable undertakings aim at creating a computer-
ized in-home constant demonstrative apparatus to screen the intellectual degeneration of 
patients experiencing dementia.
8.12  Applications of AAL
Assisted living has become important these days for the reason that every individual is 
engaged in his or her own work and has little time to spend with others. People spend 
most of the time in the digital world and are connected by it. This situation leads to the 
finding of a solution to attend and assist the old aged and the specially abled individuals 
to live an independent and comfortable life. AAL facilitates this and has a lot of solutions 
ranging from a small requirement like BP monitoring to critical health care. Below are 
some of the applications on assisted living.
•	 Temperature, blood pressure, diabetes, oxygen, calorie recording, and monitoring 
system
•	 Digitalized ECG monitoring system with remote access
•	 Sleep monitoring system with sensors set on the bed
•	 Mobility assistance system that supports in activities like walking
•	 Medication reminders and step count

163
Aspects of Ambient Assisted Living and Its Applications
•	 Personal emergency response devices that are connected to the caretaker and 
doctors
•	 Monitoring the daily routine activity patterns from which we can find the change 
in diet, sleeping, medications, etc.
•	 Fitness tracker system
•	 Smart security devices for homes
•	 Smart home with automated response for door bell, temperature control, smart 
stove, light sensing, smart lock, etc.
•	 Smart devices that can predict the fall of the elderly, which are quiet common, and 
assist them
Advantages involved in installing these devices are:
•	 Comfort and independent life style
•	 Cost efficiency
•	 Reduce the physical demand, assistance, and home maintenance
•	 Reduces the anxiety about the elderly during office hours
•	 Secure and safe home for independent living
•	 Medical support in absence of caretaker
8.13  Conclusion
AAL is a boon of technology for the elderly that can support their life. It makes their life 
hassle-free, easy, simple, and sophisticated giving them much needed confidence and hap-
piness. Wearable devices designed for all-time wearing without discomfort will acquire the 
data and sent to remote servers for further processing. Analytics performed on the acquired 
data will support decision-making in the critical situation or in absence of the caretaker. 
Designing such a system needs extensive care as it deals with real life situations. Software 
engineering concepts are applied for effective modeling of AAL systems to match with 
the requirements of the application in user and system perception. Communicative tech-
nologies and system capabilities play an important role in developing a flawless applica-
tion. The main challenges are using reliable sensors with cost-effectiveness, uninterrupted 
power supply for the device with less consumption, and selection of good communication 
medium with appropriate protocol. However, supremacy of the AAL relies on the above 
points still the design of device bounces an impression of comfort to the end user’s.

9.1  Introduction
The term the Internet of things (IoT) is becoming an increasingly growing topic of con-
versation both in workplace and outside of it. IoT is a system of interrelated computing 
devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided 
with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requir-
ing human-to-human-to-computer interaction. Here we need to know how the devices or

Internet of Things (IoT)
things in IoT are communicating and how the name service will translate the meaning-
ful names to a machine-understandable form. Name services means to translate human-
understandable names into network identifiers that can be used for communications in the 
computer networks. Mainly we are using Internet Protocol (IP) address for the communi-
cation of hosts over the network. But it will be very difficult for humans to memorize the 
IP address, which is a 32-bit number and type it in the URL field to access the web pages. 
This difficulty raised the need of using memorable words (for example, www.google.com) 
to access the web pages. Li et al. introduced a naming, addressing, and profile (NAPS) 
server for the naming and addressing in IoT.
One of the main issues in the existing methods is the lack of de facto standard in the 
NAPS server, as a middleware [1] interoperable with heterogeneous platforms [2]. So if there 
exists a homogenous naming and addressing convention, then the application develop-
ers can easily retrieve data from sensors and control the actuators of different networks. 
Otherwise the application developers need to spend much time to learn about different pro-
tocols and standards. So a higher layer of device naming–addressing mapping should be 
provided to integrate with legacy systems and different platforms. For the device naming, 
the convention should contain key elements of meta-data, such as device type and domain 
information, while for addressing its format allows the granularity of efficient accessibil-
ity and addressability to the physical world. Profile services are also needed to aid the 
application query and system configurations, like device status and presence. Furthermore, 
sensing tasks are always achieved by a group of devices with similar sensing capabilities, 
and thus NAPS should provide device group management functionalities, such as to cre-
ate, update, read, and delete groups. As we can create groups, only a device group name 
is needed to share the information. In this way, application development logic is greatly 
simplified where only a device group name is needed and NAPS handles the internal map-
ping. As a middleware, it should extend its usability by providing abundant external inter-
faces. IPv4, IPv6, and Domain Name System (DNS) are usually considered as the candidate 
standard for naming and addressing; however, due to the lack of communication and pro-
cessing capabilities of many small and cheap devices (like Radio Frequency Identification 
(RFID) tags), it is quite challenging to connect every “thing” with an IP. Furthermore, with 
the increasing amount of end devices, even IPv6’s address space may not be enough. On the 
other hand, industry standards have put much effort in each application domain. EPCglobal 
[3] uses a 96-bit binary sequence to identify each RFID tag, and the object naming service 
(ONS) for URL translation. OPC- Unified Architecture [4] defines client-server-based mod-
els for industrial production line solutions, where an abstract address space is formed by 
a mesh topology. In it, each node represents a sensor in the production stage and the edge 
between two nodes represents the stage-by-stage relationship during the production. As an 
overall service architecture, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [5] 
proposed a solution interworking with 3GPP machine-type communication (MTC) stan-
dard [6], to support machine-to-machine (M2M) communications when upgrading from 
traditional cellular networks where each device is with a unique international mobile sub-
scriber identity (IMSI) and is IP addressable. Furthermore, as a service layer architecture, it 
defines a variety of service capabilities (SCs) including a network reachability, addressing, 
and repository (NRAR) SC. Our goal in this work is to work with any service platforms as 
a middleware at the back-end data center. Therefore, all these efforts pay attention only to 
a specific network or application domain, however, not applicable as a common platform 
managing different technologies and standards.

control the physical world, which are interconnected either wirelessly or wired through 
a variety of access network technologies. Some examples are cellular networks (2G/3G/
LTE), IEEE 802.11/802.15 series of standards for Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, RFID readers 
and tags, and wireline technologies like power-line communications (PLCs), etc. Usually 
there exists a gateway interconnecting the access networks and the backbone Internet. 
Data are then routed either through the carrier public network or IoT private network. 
For the former, standard like 3GPP MTC is defined to upgrade the existing backbone cel-
lular network to manage M2M devices. For the latter, most service layer architectures, like 
EPCglobal RFID architecture or OPC-UA client–server model, leverage existing transport 
layer protocols such as CoAP [7] over UDP, and HTTP over TCP. In the service layer, ETSI 
M2M service architecture can interwork with 3GPP MTC via interworking function (IWF) 
that enables seamless integration of M2M SC layer with cellular MTC devices. That is, 
M2M SCs can invoke and leverage cellular MTC functions to optimize and support bet-
ter M2M services. Meanwhile, cellular MTC functions can be enhanced for M2M SCs. 
Companies like InterDigital and Juniper Networks have this kind of solution [8,9].
Toward this end, there is a lack of a common platform interoperable with different ­platforms 
to hide this heterogeneity and provide a transparent naming service to applications. The key 
technical constituents of IoT-AI are application gateway (AG), NAPS and its service registra-
tion portal (Portal), and real-time operational database (RODB). AG ­coordinates the data

filtering and processing and controls message delivery based on a uniform device naming 
and addressing convention in NAPS. The goal is to have applications access devices across 
different platforms without knowing their languages in detail, but focusing on the develop-
ment logic only. The position of NAPS extends the functionality comparable to DNS in the 
Internet, to the profile services such as storage and query. We next present three assumptions 
of this work. First is service discovery. As the scope of NAPS is a middleware component at 
the back-end data center to hide the heterogeneous protocols and standards, here we assume 
that service discovery has already been successfully performed by each platform individu-
ally, and stored in our NAPS repository. Examples are service discovery server enhanced 
from ETSI M2M service architecture by Inter-Digital [8], discovery service set in OPC-UA 
standard, and protocols like Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) [10]. Second is the authentica-
tion, authorization, and accounting (AAA). Although it is not the focus of this work, the 
design can largely leverage the network security capability (NSEC) SC in ETSI M2M service 
architecture. It uses a key hierarchy, composed of root key, service key, and application keys. 
Root key is used to derive service keys through authentication, and key agreement between 
the device or ­gateway and the M2M SCs at the M2M Core. The application key, derived from 
service key, is unique as per M2M application.
Finally, we assume that wireless imperfection like packet errors and interference have 
been handled by the communication stack of each access networks. Solutions from PHY 
layer techniques (e.g., antenna techniques, modulation, and coding) and MAC/network 
layer protocols (e.g., scheduling and routing) are a few examples. Therefore, any wireless 
issues are completely transparent to the service layer operations, or the NAPS middleware 
considered in this paper.
EU FP7 project IoT-Architecture (IoT-A) extensively discussed the existing architectures, 
protocols, and platforms [11]. Besides, Castellani et al. [12] propose a framework to intercon-
nect sensors running 6LoWPAN [13], where IEEE 802.15.4 and IPv6 were considered to con-
nect wireless devices to the Internet. Silverajan and Harju [14] provide an XML schema to 
encode device profile information including its local name. Web-of-things (WoT [15]) make 
use of popular Web languages for building applications involving smart things and users.
As for industrial standards, based on DNS, the pure IP solution [16] is favored due to the 
recent development of IPv6 to connect “things” for IoT. EPCglobal [3] specializes in use of 
RFID in the information-rich and trading networks, especially for logistics. In it, similar 
to DNS, an ONS is designed to translate a 96-bit binary sequence to a uniform resource 
identifier (URI), which directs the query to a (set of) database(s) called EPC information 
service for information retrieval and update. OPC-UA [4] defines an address space where 
devices are interconnected to form a mesh topology. The connectivity represents the pro-
duction line sequence, where the directional edge called “reference” links the next stage of 
behavior. ETSI M2M service architecture [5] assumes each M2M device is IP addressable. 
In 3GPP MTC [6], they propose to use the IMSI as the internal identifier for signaling and 
charging, while providing external identifiers to include domain information under the 
control of a network operator, and flexibly allocated descriptions as the customer-friendly 
local identifier. On the other hand, naming and addressing for wireless sensor networks 
have been extensively investigated [17–20]. The first kind of approaches rely on the effi-
cient address allocation among nodes, where in [21,22] the assigned addresses are reused 
spatially and represented by variable length of code words. This was later extended by 
Kronewitter [23] who used the prefix-free Huffman encoding of node addresses based on 
the energy map, where nodes with little battery life left will have the advantage of a short 
address and check period. Elson and Estrin [24] proposed the “attribute-based naming.” 
In the work by Heidemann et al. [25], clients use an intentional name to request a service

171
Naming Services in the Internet of Things
without explicitly listing the end-node that ultimately serves the request. This level of indi-
rection allows applications to seamlessly continue communicating with end-nodes even 
though the mapping from name to end-node addresses may change during the ­session. 
Finally, unique identifier generation problem is investigated by Shen et al. [26], where they 
designed a correlated lookup scheme with a distributed hash table to improve the perfor-
mance of identifier management.
However, none of these schemes are motivated from the service layer as part of the 
middleware at the back-end data center, nor they tackle the fundamental problem of pro-
viding a homogenous, both human and machine understandable, and unique naming 
and addressing convention across different platforms. Furthermore, none of them support 
­profile services and legacy system integration.
9.2  Name Service
With respect to the IoT, a name service helps in the following situation (Figure 9.2). We 
have read an identifier, regarded as a name, from an RFID tag attached to an object. Then 
we need to find the corresponding information sources on the Internet. That is, an IoT 
name service resolves object identifiers to information service addresses. In the main ref-
erence architecture by EPCglobal two categories of name services are used. The first is 
the ONS to locate the item manufacturer and uses—as of today—only EPC Manager and 
Object Class fields of an Serialized Global Trade Identification (SGTIN) EPC. The second 
category comprises EPCIS Discovery Services, which shall offer lookup of multiple infor-
mation sources related to fully serialized EPCs.

9.2.1  Requirements
In this section we discuss the functional and performance requirements of IoT name 
­services. Functional requirement means the functionality and services that a system 
should provide. Nonfunctional requirements include the constraints on the system func-
tionality such as performance, quality, safety, etc. The following high-level functional, 
scalability, performance, and robustness requirements of an IoT name service S can be 
identified.
Function roles of IOT Name Service are shown in Table 9.1.
9.2.1.1  Functional Requirements for an IoT Name Service
	
1.	System Membership and Authorization Procedure: A set of membership definition and 
authorization procedures for all publishers and clients of name service S shall be 
provided. Those procedures shall define:
	
a.	 Which publishers shall be authorized to publish information about what kind 
of object identifiers (OIDs).
	
b.	 Which clients shall be granted authorized access to what object information 
service (OIS) address information and to which actual object information.
	
c.	 Which parties are allowed or even obliged to insert machine components into 
S and who may run sub-services of S, for example, security services in the 
form of Certification Authorities.
	
	 The first and third procedures should be a global convention between all IoT 
users; the second set of procedures can be delegated to the authorized informa-
tion ­providers. In theory, membership could be free to everyone, so that every-
one may be able to publish and retrieve information about any object, but in 
practice there will be constraints by the information provider’s economic and 
security interests.
	
2.	Flexible OID Support: S should be flexible in its support for different OID schemes.
	
3.	Publishing: An information provider shall be able to input address documents 
into S for OIDs for which he is authorized to publish information. These docu-
ments shall include addresses of OIS servers providing information about objects 
­carrying those OIDs.

4.	Multiple Publishers (Independent): Multiple independent but authorized publish-
ers should be able to provide information for an OID by storing corresponding 
address data in S, without possible mutual interference, like censorship.
	
5.	Querying: On input of OID e by a client, S shall output a current list of servers 
offering information about the object corresponding to e.
	
6.	Updating: Authorized publishers shall be able to update the data records they 
­published at will.
	
7.	Deleting: Authorized publishers shall be able to delete the data records they 
­published at will. A time-to-live (TTL) value should be provided for each docu-
ment to indicate old data and to reduce overhead for deletion.
	
8.	Class-Level Addresses: If the OID is structured into a class-level and serial-level 
part, S shall be able to work with partial OIDs at the class-level; for example, a 
partial SGTIN EPC consisting of EPC Manager and Object Class.
	
9.	Serial-Level Addresses: If the OID is structured into a class-level and serial-level part, 
S should be able to work with fully serialized OIDs, for example a complete SGTIN 
EPC consisting of EPC Manager, Object Class, and Serial Number (see Figure 9.3). 
Most EPCs have a similar structure as shown in Figure 9.3.
	 10.	Object Information (optional): S should itself be able to store and return (small 
amounts) of object information about OIDs to reduce query overhead, for example, 
directly indicating if an object’s official lifetime has expired.

Internet of Things (IoT)
9.2.1.1.1  Scalability
The system must be able to work on a global scale. Because it is used for the IOT, it is 
­probable that S—in the long run—must cope with much more traffic than the usage of 
DNS for URL name resolution performed today.
	
1.	High Node Count: S should work with a very large number of participating nodes 
(servers).
	
2.	High Client Count: S should work with a very large number of participating clients.
	
3.	Scalability to Medium IoT Adoption: S shall work in scenarios with a medium-level 
adoption of the IOT across businesses.
	
4.	Scalability to Large IoT Adoption: Class-Level Lookups: S should work in scenar-
ios with a high-level adoption of the IOT across business and society, serving 
­class-level queries.
	
5.	Scalability to Large IoT Adoption: Serial-Level Lookups: S should work in scenarios 
with a high-level adoption of the IOT, serving also serial-level queries.
9.2.1.1.2  Performance
The IOT name service S must be able to deliver a performance that is suitable for global use 
in very heterogeneous applications. This includes:
	
1.	Fast Update Propagation: Information changed by authorized information provid-
ers should be propagated fast throughout the system, to avoid stale data.
	
2.	Low Latency: The waiting time for an answer by S to a query shall be short, below 
one minute to enable nearly real-time operations.
	
3.	Ultra-Low Latency (optional): The waiting time for an answer to a query should be 
very short, e.g., below a few seconds, to enable real-time or interactive applications 
with human beings who deem longer waiting times unacceptable.
	
4.	Acceptable Load (Average Node): The network, storage, and processing load of an 
average node (server) of S must not be too high, to guarantee its correct and fast 
execution of tasks.
	
5.	Acceptable Load (Special Nodes, Root): The network, storage, and processing load 
of all special or root nodes (servers) of S must not be too high, to guarantee their 
correct and fast execution of tasks.
9.2.1.1.3  Robustness
S should perform reliably in the face of apparently random errors and attacks common 
on the Internet. Again, most of the high-level requirements are not precise. Depending 
on particular application scenarios, each high-level requirement should be refined and 
mapped to several more exact metrics and corresponding tolerance intervals, so that their 
fulfillment can be verified. A similar refinement process can be described in a mathemati-
cally rigorous way for security, especially confidentiality requirements. During additional 
process iterations, additional time and domain-specific requirements—arising from spe-
cific application domains—should be combined and reconciled, and again compared to 
design options.

9.2.1.2  Security Requirements
Someone who places value into an information asset and wants it to be protected is called 
a stakeholder of that asset. This definition allows for a generalization of classical security 
requirements engineering to the multiple stakeholders of multilateral security [27]. In clas-
sic security requirements engineering, for example in parts of the Common Criteria, only 
one stakeholder is considered, i.e., the owner of a target of evaluation (ToE) [28].
In the following, we use the classical triad of protection goals, which a stakeholder may 
have with respect to an information asset: availability, integrity [29], and confidentiality [30]. 
We subsume, for example, anonymity under confidentiality of identity, and authenticity 
under integrity.
•	 Availability: The property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an 
authorized entity [31]. Alternatively, formulated by avoidance; the prevention of 
unauthorized withholding of information or resources.
•	 Integrity: The property of safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of assets. 
That means the prevention of unauthorized modification of information.
•	 Confidentiality: The property that information is not made available or disclosed 
to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. That means the prevention of 
unauthorized disclosure of information. Extending classical security engineering, 
the concept of multilateral security emphasizes the importance of taking the secu-
rity goals of most or ideally all stakeholders into account before designing and 
building a system, not only of system owners or investors. This becomes espe-
cially important for confidentiality requirements of system users.
9.2.1.2.1  Availability
The system S, i.e., the IOTNS (Figure 9.4), should be constructed, and its data should be 
available to authorized users any time they need to access it. We assume this to be a 
requirement shared by all stakeholders. In particular, S should offer robustness to targeted 
(Distributed) Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks; the system should avoid single points of 
failure, and be able to adjust itself to failures of single components (servers or nodes).
9.2.1.2.2  Multipolarity
A specific case of availability concerns the anticipated future role of the IoT as critical IT 
infrastructure in many countries. Considered as stakeholders of S, those countries will

have a high interest that no single one of them controls access to S, or could prevent it from 
working. This requirement will be discussed in detail in the next chapters.
9.2.1.2.3  Integrity
S shall offer data integrity, including authenticity of data origin. All unauthorized 
changes to the data stored in S should be detectable by a client via means integrated 
into S. S should also prevent spamming and pharming attacks, which aim to add arbi-
trary, non-authorized data entries to S. All of those also will be assumed common 
requirements of all stakeholders.
In addition, there are special cases where data integrity may need to be enforced by 
system integrity in lower-level design steps; for example, to deliver authentic messages 
on non existence of records or during the publishing phase, where the system node that 
is contacted for publishing needs to be authentic. Data integrity should also include a 
measure to assess the age of data, as well as provide nonrepudiation, i.e., the fact that a 
provider published exactly these data should be provable to third parties, for example, for 
auditing or legal purposes.
9.2.1.2.4  Confidentiality
In classical security engineering, confidentiality requirements usually have been consid-
ered only for the information provider or server side of an Internet service, such as con-
fidentiality enforced by access control for the data offered by a Web server. This provider 
perspective also applies to ubiquitous computing environments and the IoT, but is far from 
complete. Clients of IoT services are also stakeholders whose security requirements need 
to be accounted for.
Stakeholder confidentiality requirements on the client side of S, however, usually do not 
only refer to data processed in a system, but also to high-level information (e.g., turnover 
or lifestyle) inferable from using the system, and multiple entities (persons, organizations, 
competitors, criminals, the public) from whom that information must be kept confidential 
(counter-stakeholders).
As an example, consider the use of RFID, IoT, and the name service S in a smart home 
owned by an individual, Bob Concerned, and on a shop floor (Figure 9.5). Bob Concerned 
practices a lifestyle he wants to keep confidential from others (Figure 9.5a). These oth-
ers are the counter-stakeholders of his confidentiality requirements, including neighbors, 
marketing companies, and governments, or other entities who adopt functional roles in 
the IoT (Table 9.1). The shop has confidentiality goals that have a similar structure to Bob’s 
goals (Figure 9.5b). For example, the shop produces turnover that it wants to keep confi-
dential from competing shops.
Many of those high-level information assets may be inferable—simply from the obser-
vation of queries to S, by using query data analysis and mining from content, location, 
time, frequency, clusters of queries, and changes over time. For example, lifestyle can be 
inferred by analyzing which item brands are in regular use at Bob’s home and are creating 
periodic query patterns to the IoT, or how often new and potentially expensive or cheap 
items are detected by his RFID readers, while EPCs are resolved to retrieve item informa-
tion for smart home services. Similarly, the shop’s turnover can be inferred by observing 
periodic inventory queries to the IOT, watching for specific brands, items missing, returns, 
or new arrivals. However, Bob Concerned or the shop may not even be aware of the data 
traces that they are producing in their smart environments equipped with RFID read-
ers, and across IOT name and information servers, simply by querying and retrieving 
item-related information. Therefore, it will become very difficult for security engineering 
www.ebook3000.com

177
Naming Services in the Internet of Things
to state confidentiality requirements for Ubiquitous Computing (UC) in a rigorous way. 
Not only does the what to protect become harder to specify the more concrete a system 
becomes in the development process, also the against whom becomes difficult to state pre-
cisely for omnipresent, globally connected machines and environments operated by mul-
tiple stakeholders, some of which may not even be known in advance. On the other hand, 
protection against all potential adversaries seems to be impossible to achieve in practice.
Furthermore, mappings between counter-stakeholders and functional system roles are 
not always clear, in addition to the ever-present possibility of external attacks. Counter-
stakeholders and adversaries usually also differ in the degree of background knowledge 
they have available for data analysis, which could abstractly be described by general con-
ditional probability distributions, but seems nearly impossible to quantify for all adversar-
ies during run-time, or in earlier development stages. To cope with those problems, we can 
use a pragmatically oriented approach and apply a rule-of-thumb guideline: low-level data 
in S should be as hard to collect or analyze as possible.
Consequently, while using the IoT, there will be many situations when the EPC belonging to 
an RFID-tagged item should be regarded as sensitive information—be it in a private context, 
where people fear to be tracked or have their belongings read by strangers, or in a business

context, where product flows constitute valuable business intelligence. The ­combination of 
an EPC company identifier and item reference is usually enough to determine the exact kind 
of object to which it belongs. This information can be used to identify assets of an individual 
or an organization. If someone happens to wear a rare item or a rare combination of belong-
ings, one could track that person even without knowing the actual serial numbers. In addi-
tion to this supply side, there are also many entities that have a certain or at least potential 
demand for EPC traces, which will be illustrated in the following section.
9.3  Object Naming Service
For ONS, a hierarchical, tree-like architecture has been proposed by EPCglobal. The ONS 
protocol is identical to the protocol used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The ONS 
root is the central root of this tree. Further delegation works as in DNS, and information 
providers itself will deploy authoritative ONS servers—for their EPC ranges—that point 
to their actual EPCIS. This architecture and protocol choice will have a deep impact on the 
reliability, security, and privacy of the involved stakeholders and their business processes, 
especially for information clients, as will be discussed after the technical inheritance of 
DNS has been described in the next section.
9.3.1  ONS Foundation: DNS
From a technical point of view, ONS is a subsystem of the DNS, and are codified in many 
requests-for-comments (RFCs). The main design idea of ONS is to first encode the EPC into 
a syntactically correct domain name, then to use the existing DNS infrastructure to query 
for additional information. This procedure makes use of the Naming Authority Pointer 
(NAPTR) DNS record, which is also used with other Internet applications, for example the 
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Voice-over-IP (VoIP) to map phone numbers into cor-
responding URIs.
For a discussion of the DNS security heritage to ONS later in this chapter, in the follow-
ing sections a short summary of the inner workings of DNS is given, discussing names, 
architecture, and protocol.
9.3.1.1  DNS Names and Architecture
The basic function of the DNS is that of an Internet name service: the resolution of human-
memorable, alpha-numerical hostnames into the corresponding purely numerical IP 
addresses used for datagram routing. At an early stage of the Internet, the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), name resolution was performed by refer-
ring to a flat text file that stored mappings between the hostnames and the IP addresses 
(hosts file). Obviously, maintaining and synchronizing copies of the hosts file on all com-
puters connected to ARPANET were extremely inefficient. To address this issue, the name 
resolution protocol was updated to introduce a central distribution of the master hosts 
file via an online service maintained by the Network Information Center. This architec-
ture worked successfully for about a decade. However, the rapid growth of the Internet 
rendered this centralized approach impractical. The increasing number of changes intro-
duced to the hosts file and its growing size required hosts to regularly download large

179
Naming Services in the Internet of Things
volumes of data and often led to propagation of network-wide errors. As a reaction, shortly 
after deployment of TCP/IP, the new DNS was introduced. This DNS still serves as the 
foundation of the Internet name resolution system today. A hostname now has a com-
pound structure and consists of a number of labels separated by dots, e.g., www.example.
com.—the final dot is often omitted. The labels specify corresponding domains: the empty 
string next to the rightmost dot corresponds to the root domain, the next label to the left 
to the top-level domain (TLD), followed by the second-level domain (SLD), and so forth.
The resolution of the hostname into the corresponding IP address is carried out by 
a tree-like hierarchy of DNS name servers. Each node of the hierarchy consists of DNS 
name servers that store a list of resource records (RRs) mapping domain names into IP 
addresses of Internet sites belonging to a zone for which the DNS servers are authorita-
tive. Alternatively, in case of zone delegation, IP addresses of DNS servers located at the 
lower levels of the hierarchy are returned. The resolution of a hostname is performed by 
subsequently resolving domains of the hostname from right to left, thereby traversing the 
hierarchy of the DNS name servers until the corresponding IP address is obtained.
In addition to name-to-IP resolution used by nearly every Internet application today, 
there are several other established and future uses of DNS, such as inverse queries (IP-to-
name), queries for mail server addresses (using MX RRs), DNS use for storing VoIP phone 
numbers, key distribution, and even for stating communication security requirements. 
ONS will place additional DNS burden on top of the load created by all those applications.
9.3.1.2  DNS Protocol
The DNS protocol is part of the application layer of the TCP/IP hierarchy. In general, it 
uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with server port 53 as transport layer protocol for 
queries and responses. DNS uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for responses 
larger than 512 bytes, as well as for higher reliability of zone transfers between DNS serv-
ers. An exception is the use of the so-called extension mechanisms for DNS, which allow 
larger DNS payloads to be transported via UDP, and is important for transferring signatures 
for DNS security extensions (DNSSEC). To match incoming responses with previous que-
ries, DNS uses a 16-bit query identifier located in the DNS header. In addition, the header 
carries multiple status bits indicating query or response, authoritative answer, response 
truncation, and the desire for—respectively, availability of—recursive query tasks for the 
name server. The actual query or answer DNS RRs, as well as possible additional informa-
tion, follow after the header in specific section of a DNS packet. To reduce the message size 
due to the classical 512-byte limit, a compression and pointer scheme is used to avoid the 
repetition of names, which however increases the parsing complexity for human eye and 
DNS software, and has been the cause of implementation errors in the past.
In the following, the inner workings of the ONS resolution process and its use of DNS 
are described.
9.3.2  ONS Resolution Process
The ONS resolution process is described in the work of Mealling [32]. For a schematic 
view of the communication procedure, see Figure 9.6. After an RFID reader has received 
an EPC in binary form, it forwards it to some local middleware system. To retrieve the list 
of relevant EPCIS servers for this particular object, the middleware system converts the 
EPC to its URI form (e.g., urn:epc:id:sgtin:809453.1734.108265). Then this is handed over 
to the local ONS resolver, which in turn translates the URI form into a domain name 

180
Internet of Things (IoT)
(e.g., 1734.809453.sgtin.id.onsepc.com) by following a well-defined procedure. This name 
belongs to a ­subdomain of the domain onsepc.com, which is reserved for ONS use.
The current ONS specification states that the serial part (item level, in the example: 
108265) of the EPC, which differentiates between objects of the same kind and brand, 
should not be encoded as of now, but it leaves room for such a possibility: The ability to 
specify an ONS query at the serial number level of granularity as well as the architectural 
and economic impacts of that capability is an open issue that will be addressed in subse-
quent versions of this document. Its lack of mention here should not be construed as mak-
ing that behavior legal or illegal. This newly created domain name is now queried for by 
using the common DNS protocol, possibly involving a recursive query to a local DNS or 
service provider. DNS server that then queries iteratively across the Internet.
In addition to this primary ONS use of the DNS, note a secondary dependency on the 
existing DNS hierarchy: The names stored in ONS records and returned by the ONS 
query process will again have to be resolved into IP addresses—using the standard DNS 
­hierarchy—to receive the IP addresses of the EPCIS servers, cf. (3a, b) in Figure 9.6.
We turn now to the actual discussion of ONS security issues, especially with respect to 
the DNS heritage, which becomes critical in this new application domain.

9.3.3  ONS Security Analysis
DNS is an old and central Internet service with a long history of security and configuration 
issues in the protocol itself and in particular implementations. Various vulnerabilities and 
attacks can be listed by consulting established security sites as CERT, SecurityFocus, and 
the SANS Institute’s top 20 list of internet security vulnerabilities.
A corresponding request-for-comments, RFC 3833 Threat Analysis of the DNS, was 
­published quite late after two decades of DNS use, though many of its security problems 
have been identified before. Some of the main threats discussed are packet interception, 
i.e., manipulating IP packets carrying DNS information, query prediction by manipulating 
the query and answer schemes of the DNS protocol, cache poisoning by injecting manipu-
lated information into DNS caches, betrayal by trusted servers controlled by an attacker, 
and denial of service, a threat to every Internet service—but DNS itself might be used as 
an amplifier to attack third parties.
Besides bugs in the code, the fundamental reason for most of these vulnerabilities is the 
fact that even though DNS is a central and highly exposed service by definition, it has—in 
its original and widely deployed form—no way of authenticating a client, the server, nor 
the information that is provided. In addition, DNS uses a clear text protocol, as do most of 
the early IPs.
These DNS weaknesses directly transfer to ONS. In the following sections, a discussion 
on ONS availability, integrity, and confidentiality risks is given.
9.3.3.1  ONS Availability
ONS will constitute a service highly exposed to attacks from the Internet, if only due to 
its necessary widespread accessibility. A particular threat is denial of service (DoS), which 
abuses system and network resources to make the service unavailable or unusably slow 
for legitimate users. This could include DDoS attacks overwhelming a particular server or 
its network connection by issuing countless and intense queries, e.g., by the use of zom-
bie networks, Botnets or the so-called Puppetnets, i.e., hosts controlled by browser-based 
malware. DoS attacks can also use more sophisticated methods, e.g., targeted exploits that 
shut down the DNS server software or the operating system. Though distributed, DNS 
suffers from limited redundancy in practical implementations. Authoritative name serv-
ers for any given zone should be redundant according to RFC 1034. Recent studies on real 
implementations, however, show that for a non-insignificant part of the global name-space 
this requirement does not hold. Name servers storing the same information for a given 
zone are often few and not redundantly placed with respect to geographical location and 
IP subnets, and often reside inside of the same autonomous system (AS). There are many 
servers that have single distinct routing bottlenecks on paths to reach them—from every 
place in the world.
The small number of servers for a given zone information, and their limited redun-
dancy creates single points or small areas of failure. Those are also attractive targets for 
DDoS attacks—not only at the DNS root, which is currently run by fewer than 150 servers 
and has been attacked with some, but so far moderate, success before. Failure of the root, 
though, would after some time to account for caching imply failure of the whole system, 
not only of some of its subtrees. Root and TLD servers, as well as name servers for domains 
that rise in popularity (flash crowds, for example the famous Slashdot effect), suffer from 
strong load imbalance induced by the architecture. Omnipresent DNS caching, on the 
other hand, reduces flexibility and the speed of update propagation. Studies also show the 

182
Internet of Things (IoT)
significance of human configuration errors that slow down the resolution process or even 
cause it to fail. Part of the problem is the complexity of the DNS delegation process, which 
is based on cooperation across different organizations. Therefore, an integration of the 
EPCglobal Network with ONS as proposed into core business processes could leave even 
formerly non-IT related companies dependable on the availability of Internet ­services. 
This will most probably increase overall business risk.
9.3.4  Named Data Networking
Shang et al. [33] discussed how named data networking (NDN) addresses the root causes 
of the various challenges in IoT and can help achieve the IoT vision in a more secure, 
straightforward, and innovation-friendly manner. The first challenge of IoT is how to 
enable all different types of digital devices that provide IoT functionality to communicate 
locally and globally. The second is how to consistently and securely communicate the data 
associated with the things themselves, once connectivity is achieved.
NDN fundamentally shifts the network communication model from host-centric to 
data-centric. Instead of sending packets between source and destination devices identified 
by numeric IP addresses, NDN disseminates named data at the network level, forward-
ing directly on names that carry application semantics. Moreover, each packet in NDN is 
secured at the time of production, allowing data replication anywhere in the network and 
preserving security properties of the data over its lifetime. Amadeo et al. [34] ­proposed 
a baseline NDN framework for the support of reliable retrieval of data from different 
­wireless producers which can answer to the same Interest packet (e.g., a monitoring appli-
cation collecting environmental data from sensors in a target area). The solution is evalu-
ated through simulations in NDN SIM and achieved results show that, by leveraging the 
concept of excluded field and ad hoc defined schemes for data suppression and collision 
avoidance, it leads to improved performance in terms of data collection time and network 
overhead.
The research community is currently exploring cutting-edge approaches to transform 
the Internet, as we know it today, into a system more capable of and tailored for effective 
content distribution, according to today’s (and tomorrow’s) needs. Information-centric net-
working (ICN) has been recently proposed for this purpose and is inspiring the design of 
the future Internet architecture. Unlike the IP-address-centric networking of the current 
Internet, in ICN every piece of content has a unique, persistent, location-independent name, 
which is directly used by applications for accessing data. This revolutionary ­paradigm 
also provides content-based security regardless of the distribution channel and enables 
in-network data caching. Amadeo et al. [35] discussed the challenges and ­opportunities 
in ICN.
9.4  Efficient Naming, Addressing, and Profile Services in 
IoT Sensory Environments
In this section we discuss the naming, addressing, and profile services in IoT intro-
duced by Li et al. [36]. They introduced a NAPS server to interconnect different plat-
forms in the IoT environment. NAPS serves as the key module at the back-end data 
center to aid the efficient upstream sensory data collection, content-based data filtering, 
www.ebook3000.com

183
Naming Services in the Internet of Things
and matching and downstream efficient control by applications. The main difference 
between the existing approach and the Li’s approach is the introduction of a middleware 
component. The earlier approaches focused on a specific protocol, while the approach 
by Liu et al. [36] gives more focus on the middleware component, which serves dynamic 
application needs, ­sensors/actuators deployment, and configurations across different 
platforms.
In the following sections, we discuss the design of NAPS, including its key 
­functionalities, system flows, interfaces, and individual module design. We discuss also 
a unique device naming and addressing convention and show its applicability to a few 
widely used standards and protocols. We deal with also an efficient identifier genera-
tion scheme.
In this section, our contributions are summarized fourfold. First, we propose a complete 
and detailed design of NAPS, including its key system flows, interfaces, and individual 
module designs. Second, we propose a unique device naming and addressing convention 
interworking with different platforms, and we show its applicability to a few widely used 
standards and protocols. Third, we propose an efficient identifier generation scheme, not 
only used during data transportation, but also to facilitate the data filtering and matching. 
Fourth, we provide CURD operations on device, device type, and device group profiles, in 
the RESTful design style [37] over HTTP at runtime.
9.4.1  System Flows
To support the high scalability requirement, Li et al. further decomposed AG into four 
modules, front-end processor (FEP), command controller (CC), back-end processor (BEP), 
and message queue (MQ). FEP is used for data collection and format transformation, CC 
for application command parsing and translation from NAPS, BEP for rule-based data 
filtering and matching, and MQ for publish-subscribe-based topic services [38].
Then, users can identify its bottleneck and scale up/out the corresponding component, 
for example, to deploy MQs for large number of applications in a cloud. The list of compo-
nents that interact with NAPS either off-line or at runtime are AG-FEP, AG-CC, AG-BEP, 
applications, portal, and RODB, as shown in Figure 9.4 for system context and associated 
interfaces. It is worth noting that the overall IoT-AI platform is only used as an example to 
demonstrate the system flow of NAPS, whereas its applicability can extend to any external 
component with similar interfaces.
We next present system flows, service registration and configurations, upstream data 
collection, and downstream command delivery. In all aspects, an AAA server interacts 
with NAPS for security authentication and authorization.
9.4.1.1  Device Registration and Configurations
Service discovery is performed at individual platform beneath the data center service layer, 
and NAPS only provides a set of interfaces to facilitate the device registration, either auto-
matic or off-line. The registered capabilities include the ones offered by devices, device 
types, and device groups, and thus the repository stores the corresponding profile infor-
mation. The provided interfaces are based on the RESTful design style, where standard 
HTTP request/response is used to transport the data. It is worth nothing that before the 
response is returned to the client, we generate a unique device identifier, or “devID.” It con-
tains key elements of the device metadata. This devID generation process is also applicable 
when device type and device group are registered.

184
Internet of Things (IoT)
9.4.1.2  Upstream Data Collection
As shown in Figure 9.5a, when the raw data are received from an IoT platform, AG-BEP 
translates the devID to the corresponding device name (devName) as more friendly to the 
application. Meanwhile, AG-BEP makes use of devID to perform efficient content-based data 
filtering and matching. For example, one application configures a topic on MQ to aggregate 
and average the room humidity data in a smart building environment. Then, as the designed 
devID contains key elements of device metadata such as associated domain information and 
device type, it helps to categorize, filter, and select the exact set of raw data from the mas-
sive data pool. This can be achieved by masking certain encoded profile parameters. To save 
the overhead, we can use devID as the unique identifier in the transport, e.g., through the 
­carrier public network and IoT private network as shown in Figure 9.1, while using devName 
­containing a set of human-readable properties for applications.
9.4.1.3  Downstream Command Delivery
Figure 9.5b shows the downstream system flow when control messages are initialized 
by the application to specific device groups. First, device (group) name is passed to the 
AG-CC, and the latter retrieves the list of devID(s) from NAPS over the RESTful inter-
face. Then, AG-FEP translates the devID(s) to the corresponding device address(es) from 
NAPS, in which it specifies how to address the command(s) to the exact device or group of 
devices. In this way, similar to the functionality of DNS in the Internet, NAPS performs the 
name-to-address resolution. Here the main aim is to define a thin layer for address resolu-
tion, as a uniform convention to unify and cooperate different platforms. In our address-
ing convention (see Section 4.2), it specifies the way to route the command to the Internet 
gateway, which is IP addressable, such as the M2M gateway in ETSI M2M service architec-
ture, OPC-UA server, or WiMax base station. In a hierarchy, these gateways further route 
the command to the next level gateway (e.g., the ZigBee coordinator), which ­maintains its 
own addressing mechanism to the device.
9.4.1.4  Application Query
Application developers may be same as, or different from, the device owners. Therefore, 
their development logic entirely relies on identifying the right set of devices from the phys-
ical world, which may eventually belong to different network domains/platforms. Toward 
this end, as the device, device type, and device group profiles are registered and stored in 
NAPS repository, we allow search services to retrieve a list of devices and device groups 
with certain geographical, domain, and device name information. Furthermore, this pro-
cess can be coupled with downstream command delivery procedure where a retrieved 
list of device and device group names are used to issue commands to the physical world.
9.4.1.5  Integration with Different IoT Platforms
Nearly all third-party device vendors and platform operators have their own naming 
mechanism, and it is likely that they also have already developed their own applications. 
NAPS provides the translation between our uniform naming convention and the legacy 
naming, offering shared services to different vendors and applications. We thus provide 
two RESTful interfaces, getDevOldNamebyDevName() and getDevNamebyDevOld-
Name(), where the former is used when the upstream data are received by the application 
attached with our device name, and thus to be translated to the legacy name, and the 
www.ebook3000.com

185
Naming Services in the Internet of Things
latter is used when applications issue commands to the actuators by translating the legacy 
naming to the proposed one. In this way, existing naming platforms like 3GPP MTC and 
EPCglobal can be seamlessly integrate with this NAPS middleware.
9.4.2  System Designs and Implementations
Here, we discuss the naming and address convention and the generation of devID.
9.4.2.1  Naming and Addressing Convention
In this section we discuss a novel naming convention for devices and device groups across 
different platforms in a form of:
dev://domain-series/devtype/legacy-name,
grp://domain-series/target/policy/grp-name,
where the prefix distinguishes its category (as for devices or device groups), followed by a 
series of device domain information. The device domain is organized in a tree structure, 
written in the above naming convention back trace from the leaf to the root node of the 
domain tree. After the domain series, for devices we use the device type information to 
further categorize all devices associated with a domain node on the leaf of the tree, and 
finally the legacy naming (e.g., serial number) from the production phase. Meanwhile, 
device groups use the monitoring target (e.g., the room temperature) and grouping policy 
for detailed classification.
Device domain information refers to either their deployed geographical information, 
or logical organization of these devices. In NAPS, we can store multiple device domains, 
and each domain indexed r is a tree structure with depth dr and width of each level as 
{
}
∀=
w
i
d
r
i
r

1,...,
. In other words, domain r is composed of total

nodes. We call the “partition” of a domain tree by parameters 
)
(
{
}

,
 as the “domain 
rule,” and the corresponding data structure representation as “rule assignment.” For exam-
ple, the rule assignment parameters are the number of bits to store the domain nodes in 
each level of the tree. The metadata of each node include the name, its parents and chil-
dren, and other properties (see Figure 9.6). In practice, project managers of an IoT system 
will carefully plan the device deployment at a site of interest, where the first step is to plan 
an overall device domain, for example, in a smart building environment, how many tem-
perature and humidity sensors of what device type should be deployed at which location, 
and this deployment stage eventually specifies a domain tree structure, and is stored in 
NAPS repository.
As for device addressing convention, we propose to use the format:
	
address
1@ protocol
1/.../address
n @ protocol
n /IP
networks
address
non IP





−
−
−
−
−
−
	
to accommodate heterogenous protocols and standards in use across different platforms. 
To allow the granularity of addressing the device in a hierarchy, we repeat the element 
“address@protocol” one after the other from the device to the Internet gateway, which is 
IP addressable (as the last part of the convention).

186
Internet of Things (IoT)
9.4.2.2  Generating the devID
As mentioned earlier, when device profile information is registered either manually 
or automatically from each IoT platform, a devID is automatically generated. We use a 
64-bit-long integer. It is used when the data and control messages transfer between the 
access network, carrier public network, and IoT private network, to save the communi-
cation overhead over any character-based naming. However, one cannot randomly gen-
erate this sequence to avoid potential collision when a cluster of NAPS are deployed in 
a cloud ­environment. Meanwhile, the allocation of these 64 bits should have to support 
other ­components. For instance, AG will deploy its policy-based rule engine like MQ topic 
according to the device domain information, where one example is that applications may 
efficiently query all devices with mobility for their connectivity and presence at runtime 
by simply masking a portion of this devID. Toward this end, we propose the following 
design, as shown in Table 9.2.
The category field identifies the type of sequence in the database (for devID this field 
equals to 1), followed by the device type, controllable flag, read/write access flag, and 
mobility indicator. The last part is a series of domain information, starting from the domain 
rule sequence r and back trace from the leaf to the root domain nodes of that domain rule.
9.5  Conclusions
In this chapter, we briefly discussed the role of naming service and the high-level require-
ments of the name service. Also we discussed NAPS, which is a middleware to support 
device naming, application addressing, and profile storage and lookup services in IoT 
environments. Earlier approaches were only focusing on specific standard/protocol, but 
the NAPS works in any platform. Here we briefly discussed its complete design including 
its functionalities, system flows, interfaces, etc.

Internet of Things (IoT)
10.1  Introduction
Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging concept for the sensor-enabled things with inter-
net protocol (IP) address. It can connect with the Internet and collect sensor data, ana-
lyze those data, and automatically take a decision. IoT is a network of devices (things) 
connected to improve the performance of day-to-day life and also incorporates different 
kinds of resource-constrained devices like implantable (RFID tags) (Fan et al. 2009), wear-
ables (smart watches), and external devices (smart phones, thermostats, smart fridges). 
Medical research surveys indicate that about 80% of the people older than 65 years suf-
fer from at least one chronic disease. Many aged people have difficulty in taking care 
of themselves (Dohr et al. 2010; Weinstein 2005). The report “IoT Healthcare Market of 
Components, Application, End-User—Global Forecast to 2020” (Anonymous 2016a) says 
that worldwide the IoT medical information market was worth $32.47 billion in 2015. 
Also, this market value is estimated to increase by $163.24 billion in 2020. The reason 
for this huge expectation is IoT health care’s timely treatment and smart communication 
between the doctor and the patient. By using IoT medical devices, a doctor can remotely 
track a patient’s health, the working of biomedical devices, and the treatment procedure 
for the patient. This real-time monitoring of the patient’s physiological parameters are 
useful to prevent health problems in the initial stage. On the contrary, these medical 
devices are vulnerable to wireless attack when they are associated with Internet through 
IPv6, in spite of the devices being secure with cryptographic mechanism. When these 
devices are compromised by attackers, sensitive medical data will be exposed, which in 
turn threatens the patient’s life. In case, security breaches are not addressed then it is 
difficult for the technology development and lead to significant financial losses. From 
the security perspective, it is a challenging task to develop a secure protocol for devices 
with low battery power, low processing capability, and low memory capacity. Therefore, 
this chapter focuses on reviewing security challenges in IoT medical devices during 
communication across the devices. The conclusion of the review analysis will provide 
the limitations and future scope of the IoT health care.
The chapter is encapsulated as follows: Section 2 describes the study on existing secu-
rity issues in IoT communication protocol and solutions; Section 3 elaborates recent 
incidents in medical device security; Section 4 focuses on technology used for secur-
ing IoT;  Recommended positive measures for existing security issues are discussed in

10.2  Background
IoT is the buzzword for the wireless devices (things) with electronic sensor-based 
networking. A wide variety of cheap sensors (wearable, implanted, and environmental) 
have the possibility to create IoT health care. Also, these resource-constrained medical 
devices and insecure communication protocols in IoT become vulnerable to numerous 
security attacks. Therefore, this section concentrates on the study of the secure authentica-
tion scheme, protocol standardization, and optimizing communication security of medi-
cal devices (Olivier et al. 2015).

Review on Communication Security Issues in IoT Medical Devices
10.2.1  Highlights on Secure Authentication Scheme over IoT Communication
Moosavi et al. (2014) developed a secure mutual authentication scheme for a radio ­frequency 
identification (RFID) implant system. This system relies on elliptic curve cryptography 
(ECC) and the D-Quark lightweight hash technique. Performance of this work is quite 
desirable in order to implement resource-constrained medical devices. Raza et al. (2013) 
evaluated the system to find out intrusion in IoT network called SVELTE. In order to evalu-
ate SVELTE, Raza tested it with routing attacks such as spoofing, sinkhole, and selective-
forwarding. SVELTE was implemented in the Contiki OS. It detects attacks in simulated 
scenarios. Nieminen et al. (2014) proposed an anonymous verification scheme, which can 
defend some prominent properties, for example, sensor obscurity, cloning issue, and sen-
sor untraceable. This work uncovered that the proposed authentication scheme will be 
appropriate in numerous IoT applications where the protection of the sensor development 
is assured. Qiu and Ma (2015) and Gope and Hwang (2015) proposed an enhanced authen-
tication scheme for 6LoWPAN in machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. Rahman 
and Shah (2016) concentrated on a basic part of IoT connected with internet protocols. In 
IoT communication, constrained application protocols (CoAP) bind datagram transport 
layer security (DTLS) as the security operator. In spite of this, there are some areas where 
DTLS is as yet missing and can be considered a threat to the protocol.
The work carried out at present is focused only on the problem of secure authentication. 
Past research in this field was focused on security attacks. In-depth, major challenges in 
medical devices are protocol standardization and optimizing communication security of 
medical devices. The standardization and optimization of IoT protocol are discussed in 
the following sections.
10.2.2  Highlights on Standardization and Optimization of IoT Protocol
Sheng et al. (2013) conducted a survey on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
protocol suite with regard to the IoT. Considering each layer in the IETF protocol suite, 
the author argued that the technical challenges such as constrained protocols in IoT and 
research opportunities still have more scope. Sye Loong Keoh et al. (2014) elaborated 
about the efforts in the IETF standardization IoT system. The author reviewed the com-
munication security solutions for IoT, particularly security protocols, to be utilized as 
part of the CoAP.
Al-kashoash et al. (2016) proposed a new routing metric in routing protocol (RPL) which 
reduces the number of packet drops when congestion occurs. Additionally, Al-kashoash 
proposed a new RPL objective function called congestion-aware objective function 
(CA-OF). This function powerfully performs when congestion occurs by low congestion 
route selection technique. Raza et al. (2012) proposed 6LoWPAN header compression for 
DTLS. This compression technique considerably decreases the amount of extra security 
bits. Based on the review, the protocol constraints such as header compression, buffer over-
flow, routing selection, congestion, less throughput, lost packets, energy consumption, and 
packet delivery issues are identified.
10.2.2.1  Standards
Standards are essential certification for IoT medical devices and communication protocols. 
Many standards associated with medical devices are discussed in Table 10.1. Standards 
provide concrete support to the good security of the medical devices.

192
Internet of Things (IoT)
These standards provide fundamental protection to use medical devices in the IoT 
environment. These standards will support robust security solutions for both manufac-
tures and software developers. Similarly, security in the device communication relies on 
standardization of different IoT protocols (Figure 10.1).

Review on Communication Security Issues in IoT Medical Devices
10.2.2.2  Infrastructure
Infrastructure-based IoT protocols are the basic blocks of connecting devices and routing 
the data packets.
	
1.	6LoWPAN
	
	 Expansion of 6LoWPAN is IPv6 over low power, wireless personal area networks. 
In IEEE802.15.4, links of 6LoWPAN perform as an alteration layer on behalf of the 
IPv6. Sensor usage and communication capability in wireless network is provided 
by EEE 802.15.4 standard. 6LoWPAN protocol is capable of transferring 250 kilo 
bytes and 2.4GHz is the operating frequency.
	
2.	IPv4/IPv6
	
	 Usage of IPv6 with the existing IPv4 over transition technology hinders security 
management. Weak IPv6 security strategies are an immediate consequence of the 
present shortage in IPv6. To take care of this issue, the IP network threat ontology 
presented to gather and analyze different network security issues on IPv4 and 
IPv6 are discussed by Tseng et al. (2014).
	
3.	RPL
	
	 Routing protocol(RPL) is used to overcome the issues of RFC5867, RFC5826,RFC5673 
and RFC5548 standards. Winter and Thubert 2012 were examined RPL in low con-
trol and lossy networks(LLNS) to resolve the inefficiency routing, poor memory 
usage and lack of durability in battery capacity in network node).
10.2.2.3  Identification
Identification-based IoT protocols are an interface to identify the tag/device using a reader.
	
1.	EPC
	
	 EPC air interface protocol characterizes the physical and coherent prerequisites 
for an RFID framework. This protocol is capable of to work with in the range of 860 
MHz to 960 MHz  ultra high frequency (UHF). In the last 10 years, EPC Generation 
2 has perceived itself as the standard for UHF executions over numerous portions, 
and is at the heart of more RFID usage (Anonymous 2016d).
	
2.	uCode
	
	 ucode [UCODE] is an identifier to be stored in many types of tags. The embed-
ding of ucode in many types of tags like RFID tags, infrared markers, optical 
code, and even sound source is also identified by the Ubiquitous ID Center. 
The length of ucode is 128 bits; these details of ucode are stated by Ishikawa 
(2012).

For instance, a beacon may be deployed at a hand sanitizer dispenser in a hospital; 
the beacons can help make sure employees are using the station often. Some of the 
beacon protocols are iBeacon, AltBeacon, URIBeacon, and Eddystone.
	
2.	Multicast Domain Name System
	
	 Cheshire and Krochmal (2013) explained about Multicast DNS (mDNS). mDNS is 
supports DNS operations on local network in order to improve the accessibility to 
establish connection in any traditional unicast DNS server. The essential advan-
tages of mDNS names are that:
	
a.	 It requires no configuration to set them up.
	
b.	 It works when no infrastructure is available.
	
c.	 It works while infrastructure fails.
10.2.2.5  Data Protocols
Data protocols support to ensure successful data transmission between devices.
	
1.	Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
	
	 Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 
20922) publish-subscribe-based lightweight messaging protocol. MQTT is helpful

arranged transfer speed is from an optimistic standpoint.
	
2.	Message Queuing Telemetry Transport-Sensor Network
	
	 An open and lightweight subscribe protocol designed, especially for mobile 
­applications. MQTT-SN implements Mosquitto and IBM message sight 
applications..
	
3.	Constrained Application Protocol
	
	 Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is proposed for use in resource-­
constrained devices. CoAP is an application layer protocol. RESTful protocol 
design minimization, low header overhead, uniform resource identifier and 
content-type support, and support for the discovery of resources are optimization 
features for CoAP.
	
4.	Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
	
	 Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application 
layer protocol. The important features of AMQP are queuing, message orientation, 
routing, privacy, and security.
10.2.2.6  Communication/Transport Layer
The main purpose of communication and transport layer IoT protocols is to connect and 
transmit data from one device to another device successfully.

10.3  Recent Incidents in Medical Device Security
The year 2016 appeared to be mostly free of industry grasping electronic Protected Health 
Information (ePHI) breaches. However, database containing over 9 million health insurance 

196
Internet of Things (IoT)
records appeared for sale on a darknet peer-to-peer marketplace. Frauds that merit a men-
tion are: potential access and theft of over 2.2 million patient data files from the cancer 
treatment supplier, 21st Century Oncology; over 600,000 patient ePHI records compro-
mised through stolen laptops; and an estimated 265,000 patient records illegally hacked 
via malware at Bizmatics, the electronic medical records management company. Up to 2016, 
142 health care breaches were reported at the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Similarly, in 2015, 143 health care records were stolen (Anonymous 2016e; Maia et al. 2014).
10.3.1  Various Security Incidents Occurred in the Wireless Medical Devices
Wireless medical device usage in hospitals and other medical application areas have 
become common place. In this digital era, medical devices and RFID tags connected with 
Internet escalate new security vulnerabilities. In this section, we discuss the various inci-
dents that have occurred with wireless medical devices in recent times. In the United 
States of America, there was a recommendation from Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) (Alexandra 2015) that medical device manufacturers and health care facilities 
should ensure security against different kinds of attacks. The major reason behind these 
recommendations is the security vulnerability presented when using insulin pumps in the 
medical field. Insulin pumps are used to control and monitor the insulin level in patients. 
In order to operate the insulin pump, the doctor uses wireless devices like smart phone, 
smart watches, and personal digital assistant (PDAs). In case, an attacker observed the 
serial number of an insulin pump, then it is possible that the attacker can hack the control 
of the device from a few feet away. This scenario becomes worse when these kinds of 
devices are connected to the Internet. A few years back, Barnaby Jack a security researcher 
from McAfee (Dan 2011) hacked Medtronic insulin pumps on 25 October 2011 using a spe-
cial software and antenna designed by Jack. This permitted him to find and seize overall 
control of any device around 300 feet of the antenna without knowing the serial number. 
In this context, the FDA has been working closely with other government organizations 
and device manufacturers to mitigate vulnerabilities and incidents. These incidents help 
create awareness in the secure usage of medical devices. In the next section, recent case 
studies are discussed.
Hackers are targeting the health care industry, especially when compared with the 
industrial, banking, and retail sectors. In health care, investing for security is negligible, 
and as the value of individual protected health information in the black market continues 
to increase, even the largest companies in the health care industry have become a victim to 
medical data breaches. The following case studies are examples of security data breaches 
in the health care industry, as a consequence of which millions of private records have 
been compromised (Anonymous 2016e; Rodika 2015).
Table 10.2 shows the recent health care data breaches that occurred in the United States; 
these breaches highlight the importance of ensuring the security of medical device usage in 
health care IoT. In the next section, different technologies used for security IoT are discussed.

2016
The Mass General Hospital data hacking of 4,300 patient 
dental records, medical id numbers, social security 
numbers, and other identifying information was stolen 
and/or compromised.
This breach demonstrated that even utilizing the services of 
a third-party vendor hired to assist with management of 
patient data information leaves the organization open to 
data breaches and theft of patient information. Mass 
General Hospital (MGH) contracted with Patterson Dental 
Supply, Inc. (PDSI), specifically for the purpose of safely 
and securely managing their patients’ data (Akanksha 
2016).

Former US vice-president Dick Cheney told the truth in a 
meeting to CBS’ “an hour,” uncovering that when he had 
an implanted device to manage his heart pulse in 2007, he 
had his specialists turned off its remote capacities to protect 
against possible assassination attempts (Dan 2013).
Anthem health care industry 
affected by hacking, almost 80 
million records were disclosed
2014
Anthem was the victim of the largest data breach in the 
health care industry. In the cyber attack that occurred in 
December 2014, Anthem found that hackers might have 
stolen the names, social security numbers, addresses, 
income data, and health care identification numbers of 
nearly 80 million customers. In addition, and perhaps 
equally as concerning, was the fact that Anthem believed, 
but could not confirm, that medical records or credit cards 
of customers were compromised (Charlie 2015).
Banner Health identifies 
cyber-attack
2016
A data breach at Banner Health compromised at least 
3.7 million people. Compromised information included 
the names of patients and their physicians, Social Security 
numbers, and health insurance information. The first times 
ever, information gathered from purchases made at 
vending machines, including cell phone and payment data, 
was also compromised. Banner Health is yet to determine 
how hackers were able to infiltrate the organization’s 
servers and computer systems (Anonymous 2016c).
Premera Blue Cross reveals 
cyber-attack that affected 
11 million customers
2015
In 2015, over 11 million customer data records were 
compromised as a result of illicit access to Premera Blue 
Cross’ networks by an unknown hacker. While information 
compromised was very similar to the Anthem data breach, 
Premera announced that this data breach might have also 
compromised customers’ banking information and detailed 
insurance claims of customers dating as far back as 2002 
(Huddleston 2015).
Hospital network hacked and 
nearly 4.5 million records 
compromised
2014
Community health care systems in the United States 
which operates 206 hospitals, fell victim to a cyber attack 
resulting from hackers exploiting heart bleed, a known 
SSL vulnerability. As a result, 4.5 million patients had 
their names, date of birth, and social security numbers 
potentially stolen in a cyber attack that may have been 
connected in some way to the Anthem data breach 
(Jose 2014).

and test the properties that are probably going to work. QualNet creates a platform for 
designing a protocol, picturing network scenarios, and analyzing the output. To simulate and 
analyze IoT network, there is another lightweight operating system called ContikiOS which 
gives Cooja network simulator. Cooja permits vast and small networks of Contiki motes to 
be simulated. Also, MONOSEK and TinyOS platforms are used for arranging, testing, and 
practicing a tool that “mimics” the performance of a real transaction between network nodes.
10.4.1  Monosek
Monosek can effectively utilize top of the line network processing cards like Netronome’s 
NFE-3240 which has 40 smaller scale engines. Packet analysis and packet inspection are 
done by Monosek software. Monosek will be connected with either parallel network or 
serial network. It can adopt either local area network or wireless network. Monosek is also 
useful to understand various protocol traffic patterns. Packets are taken care with suitable 
flags (Anonymous 2006).
10.4.2  Qualnet
QualNet is a communication simulation platform. QualNet provides access to the users. 
Using Qualnet, an user can develop a new protocol model as well as analyze and improve 
the model. Qualnet also gives access to design large wireless and wired networks by 
utilizing the user-designed models (Anonymous 2016b).
10.4.3  TinyOS
TinyOS is an open-source operating system specially designed for energy-constrained 
wireless devices. Particularly utilized as a part of sensor system and personal area 
networks. It supports a complete 6lowpan/RPL IPv6 stack. Average download of TinyOs 
is 35,000 per year (Anonymous 2013).
10.4.4  Contiki versus TinyOS
ContikiOS is an open-source operating system for IoT and WSN. Performance of Contiki 
is good as it fulfills the requirements like efficiently using resource-constrained hardware 
platform, concurrency of the operating system, flexibility among different applications, 
and energy conservation compared to TinyOS. Comparison between Contiki and Tiny OS 
is shown in Table 10.3.
Contiki and TinyOS are both operating systems (OSs) that run on microcontrollers with 
very restricted resources. In any case, because of the higher complexity of the Contiki 
operating system kernel, TinyOS for the most part brings low-resource requirements. Both 
OSs are adaptable to handle applications.
ContikiSec and TinySec tools are provide the service of security during the node com-
munication in both operating systems. ContikiSec is a connection layer security answer 
for Contiki OS. Thus, TinySec is the security layer for TinyOS. Design of ContikiSec 
is incredibly impacted by TinySec. ContikiSec gives secrecy, trustworthiness, and 
­verification. ContikiSec has three methods of operation: ContikiSec-Enc, ContikiSec-Auth, 
and ContikiSec-AE. ContikiSec-Enc gives just secrecy; however, ContikiSec-Auth gives 
integrity and validation. ContikiSec-AE gives secrecy, confirmation, and integrity. Like 
TinySec, classification is accomplished utilizing block cipher as a part of CBCCS mode.

Review on Communication Security Issues in IoT Medical Devices
Contiki utilizes AES rather than Skipjack, and ends up being more secure, despite the fact 
that it calls for more calculation (Kamalov 2009).
Overall, comparison of both the OSs shows ContikiOS is more compatible to use in 
resource-constrained devices, using secure cryptographic mechanism, Flexibility and easy 
updating of applications in ContiSec is more preferable for testing secure communication 
protocols. In the next section, solutions and recommendations of existing ­communication 
security issues are discussed.
10.5  Solutions and Recommendations
This section focuses on providing solutions based on public key cryptography to com-
munication security issues, especially authentication issue between IoT medical devices.
10.5.1  Asymmetric Key Cryptography
Asymmetric Key Cryptographic algorithms like RSA, ECC, and DSA are more chal-
lenging to implement in wireless sensor networks because of less processing power and 
constrained memory usage. Compared to other algorithms, ECC is most suitable for IoT 
environments (Eisenbarth et al. 2007). Comparatively, ECC uses less processing power and 
storage than other algorithms (Lopez 2006). Explanation and comparison of RSA and ECC 
are presented in the following sections.
10.5.1.1  RSA
In 1977, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman presented a public key cryptographic algorithm 
named RSA. This algorithm is accepted to be secure and is generally utilized for e-business 
and transactions. The general belief about RSA’s security stems from the difficulty in

factorization of vast numbers. RSA algorithm has three parts, specific encryption part, pub-
lic key generation part, and decryption part. In the key generation part, two pairs of keys 
are generated, namely private key and public key. Whereas the private key is a secret key 
which is maintained by the sender, the public key can be shared with the receiver. Time 
taken to generate a key is very slow, it is also said to be a disadvantage of the RSA algorithm.
There are five major steps involved in RSA key generation (Anonymous 2012).
	
1.	Initially, generate two large prime numbers m and n. Make sure that m is not equal 
to n.
	
2.	Calculating product of generated prime number m and n, q = mn. The calculated 
number q should be a larger number so that the generated number p and q cannot 
be identified.
	
3.	Calculate phi Φ = (m−1)(n−1).
	
4.	Select a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < Φ and ensure that gcd (e, Φ) = 1.
	
5.	To end, find the decryption key d by calculating d mod t = 1, where t is the plaint text.
Finally, generated public key {q, e} and private key {d} are used to encrypt the secure 
plain text into cypher text as well as decrypt the cypher into plain text. RSA encipher 
is constantly done by utilization of public key. Any individual who needs to send mes-
sage to the receiver utilizing RSA encipher should first get its public key. It should be 
possible by direct exchange of keys or by utilization of any accreditation power called 
“CA.” If the message is larger than q then, split the message into two block of messages. 
Then encrypt the plaint text “t” into scrambled text called cypher text “c” and generate 
public key{q,e}. Unscrambling or deciphering process is carried out by the private key 
generated by the RSA. Then the plain text can be obtained from the scrambled text. 
Using RSA algorithm, public key digital signatures are generated. This signature can 
be verified later by any receiver with the knowledge of generated public key (Qamar 
and Hassan 2010).
RSA based signature is always computed over the hash of the original message. In order 
to make a signature, the sender node will produce a hash of the message and then raise 
it to the power of ”d mod q”, and then attach this to the original message. Receiver gets 
the digitally signed message from the sender, and the same hash function is utilized to 
compute the hash of the plain text. By verifying the signature, the receiver can ensure the 
confidentiality of the message.
10.5.1.2  Elliptic Curve Cryptography
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key cryptography developed in 1985 by 
Victor Miller and Niel Koblitz. ECC is a solid cryptographic algorithm compared to other 
public key cryptographic algorithms like RSA. ECC is a mathematical structure of elliptic 
curves over limited fields. Compared to the RSA public key algorithm, ECC is very secure. 
It is difficult to discover huge prime numbers in RSA, whereas ECC is more secure and fur-
nishes equal security while generating little key size. ECC is thought to be exceptionally 
valuable for wearable devices, smart phones, and IoT implantable medical devices (IMDs). 
ECC’s public key brings about data transfer capacity utilization and quick computation 
capability. Algebraic formula of ECC is as shown below.
d2 = b3 + ab + c
www.ebook3000.com

201
Review on Communication Security Issues in IoT Medical Devices
In this formula, b, d, a, and c are real numbers. To generate different elliptic curves, we 
can change the values of “a” and “c.” Public key is generated by scalar multiplication with 
consistent base point G in the elliptic curve, whereas private key is generated by random 
number generations. Little key size in ECC is a greatly favored option. Comparing with 
1024 key size in RSA algorithm, ECCs of 160 bit key size is equal.
Two major mathematical operations are done over elliptic curve. One is point addition and 
the other is point doubling. Point addition is shown in Figure 10.2, where addition of two 
points P and Q in elliptic curve y2 = x3 − 3x + 5 gives another point R. Example: R = P + Q.
In point doubling, addition of a P point to itself to get another point Q, that is, Q = 2P. 
Point doubling operation is shown in Figure 10.3, where addition of the same point P to 
itself in elliptic curve y2 = x3 − 3x + 5 gives another point Q. Example: Q = 2P.

The algorithm is beneficial when users can utilize private and public keys to secure the 
sensitive private data to transmit over the public medium.
10.5.1.3  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
Implementation of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is based on the 
algorithm proposed. Signature generation and verification algorithms can be seen in the 
given Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. As seen in the algorithm, the  implementation of 
signature generation requires less computational effort than the verification. Especially, 
the generation operation requires only one scalar multiplication, whereas the verification 
requires two scalar multiplications (Khalique et al. 2010).
Algorithm 1: Implemented EC signature generation algorithm. It consists of a modular 
inverse.
Operation: an addition and one scalar multiplication.
Input: Message to be signed m, EC parameters (generator point G, order o), secret key a
Output: (m, R, w) forming the signed message
	
1.	Select a random integer n with 1 ≤ n ≤ o
	
2.	Compute R = kG = (x, y)
	
3.	Compute s = k−11(m + ax) (mod o)
Algorithm 2: Implemented EC signature verification algorithm. It consists of a modular 
inverse operation, multiplications, and two scalar multiplications.
Input: Signed message to be verified (m; R; w), EC parameters (generator point G, order o), 
sender public key Q
Output: Validating the signature for the message m
	
1.	Compute d1 = w−1 m (mod o) and d2 = w−1 (mod o)
	
2.	Compute V = d1G + d2Q
	
3.	If V = R then
	
4.	Signature is valid
	
5.	Else
	
6.	Signature is invalid
10.5.2  Implementation
To incorporate public key cryptography with any sensor-based OS, numerous critical 
­components should be considered before arrangement. This section discusses the possibil-
ity of adapting cryptographic mechanism in Cooja simulator in Contiki OS. Cooja simula-
tor has a special kind of mote called Cooja mote, which helps to collect various types of 
information from nodes.
	
1.	Starting Cooja Simulator in ContikiOS
	
	 Instant Contiki development environment is a single download file. Contiki 
is an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine that keeps running in VMware player.

Review on Communication Security Issues in IoT Medical Devices
Instant Contiki supports developers to use all in-build services to understand the 
process in easy way.
	
2.	Downloading Instant Contiki
	
	 Contiki is a large file, greater than 1 gigabyte. Once downloaded, unzip the file, 
and place the unzipped directory on the desktop. Instant Contiki can be down-
loaded from the bellow link.
	
	 http://sourceforge.net/projects/contiki/files/Instant%20Contiki/
	
3.	Installing VMware Player
	
	 Download and install VMware player. It is free to download but requires a 
registration. It might require a reboot of your computer, which is unfortunate but 
needed to get the network working.
	
	 Download from the link https://download3.vmware.com/software/player/file/
VMware-player-12.5.0-4352439.exe for Windows.
	
	 Download from the link https://download3.vmware.com/software/player/file/
VMware-Player-12.5.0-4352439.x86_64.bundle for Linux.
	
	 Run VMware player and Contiki OS. Run Cooja simulator using the command 
“ant run” in the terminal. Once command is executed, Snapshot 10.1 Cooja simula-
tor home window will open.
	
4.	Creating New Simulator
	
	 Create a new simulator by giving simulator name, radio medium, Mote startup 
delay, random speed, and new random speed on reload. The Snapshot 10.2 shows 
the creation of a new simulator in Cooja.
	
5.	Add New Motes
	
	 Once the simulator is created, we can add motes using motes menu (Snapshot 10.3).
	
6.	Add Cooja Motes
	
	 Add Cooja mote with the help of creating a new mote type option as shown in the 
Snapshot 10.4.

7.	Selecting Contiki process file
	
	 After creating the Cooja mote, select the process file by browsing the location. 
The Snapshot 10.5 shows the selection of Test_ecdh.c file. This file is an elliptic 
curve signature generation and verification file to authenticate the sensor data 
transmission. In order to compile this process file, we need to include the ecc.h 
header file.
	
8.	Add new motes
	
	 Add new motes by giving values like number of motes, positioning, and position 
interval. Two Cooja motes are added in Snapshot 10.6, considered to be sender and 
receiver of sensing data.

9.	Start simulator
	
	 Start simulation and reading data transmission between the nodes in the encrypted 
form. We can use the run and speed limit window to start, pause, stop, and reload 
(Snapshot 10.7).
	 10.	Collect simulated results
	
	 Experimental results of ECC implementation in Cooja simulator.
	
	 Snapshot 10.8 shows connections between two notes and respective read-
ings of data packet transmission, temperature of node, beacon interval, delay, 
­processing speed, and lost packets. Securing this data transmission using 
most powerful public key cryptographics like elliptic curve cryptographic is 
challenging.

10.5.3  Analysis of Collected Result
Collected data was annualized in terms of memory occupancy, battery consumption, and 
processing capacity in IoT health care devices.
After adopting the principle of ECC - based authentication in Contiki Cooja simula-
tor, the battery consumption of node will be normalized. The sample battery voltage con-
sumption of particular node is shown in Figure 10.4. This scenario moderately differs in 
real time, but this result guarantees that experiment on simulated way of implementa-
tion using ECC-based authentication system is more adoptable for lightweight IoT medical 
devices.

10.5.4  Recommended Positive
In general, the major security authentication issue in medical IoT is an insecure com-
munication between IoT medical sensors/tags and sinks nodes/readers, which can be 
mitigated using the strong public key algorithms like ECC and hash function in a light-
weight manner to adopt less memory, less battery, and less processing capacity in IoT 
health care devices.

10.5.5  Scope of Future Research
Most of the research work carried out in this field is focused on simulator-based approach 
rather than real-time environment. Implementation of EEC-based lightweight cryptogra-
phy has proved that this approach is the most suitable approach for simulation environ-
ment and no work is concentrated on real-time environment. In future, the same work 
can be extended in real-time environment by utilizing the optimized resources, that is, 
speed, memory to mitigate the unauthorized access, and provision of strong security in 
IoT authentication system.
10.6  Conclusion
The overall aim of this study is to provide new security solutions as a recommendation 
to strengthen communication security. This chapter reviewed several security issues like 
mutual authentication issue, sinkhole attack, third-party intrusion, target routing, and 
spoofing, as well as device constraints such as less battery power, less memory capacity, 
and less processing capacity. In IoT medical device communication, all the security issues 
identified can be vulnerable to trustworthiness, or lack thereof, of the system. This chapter 
gives new security solutions as recommendations that can be used to provide reasonable 
guidance to IoT device communication development in future.

Internet of Things (IoT)
11.1  Introduction
The IoT devices and services, which are not well secured, can cater the potential entry 
of cyberattacks and leave the data streams poorly protected as a result of exposing the 
user data to unauthorized access. Due to the presence of interconnectivity feature of IoT 
devices, also the devices that are not securely connected online affect the global security 
and capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. As shown in Figure 11.1a and b, an IoT 
schematic has its applications in various fields.
Looking into the ethics and principles, the developers and users of IoT systems and 
devices bear a collective obligation to ensure that IoT systems and devices do not make 
the Internet and other users vulnerable to any potential harm. This calls for an intercon-
nected approach to ensure the security in order to come up with pertinent and effectual 
IoT ­solutions. Being frequent users of the Internet, a certain level of trust over the Internet 
and the connected devices is highly required, that is, because if people don’t believe the 
information exchange and their connections are safe and secure from harm, it would 
result in their reluctance in the use of the Internet.
Many IoT devices would be used in the circumstances that make it very difficult to 
upgrade or reconfigure them. The reasons might be their deployment with longer antic-
ipated service durability than what they are originally associated with or their upgrade 
process is cumbersome or impractical. At times, they have to be abandoned as they are 
left with no means of support in long terms, due to which they might outlive the com-
pany that designed them. The aforementioned scenarios indicate that the mechanisms 
adopted for security that is sufficient at the time of deployment of the device or system 
might not be sufficient to check the evolving and upcoming security threats for its full 
lifespan. This could lead to the long-term and persistent vulnerabilities. Whenever the 
manufacturer provides an update, there could be a change in functions as well without 
any notification, which leaves the user vulnerable to whatever changes the manufac-
turer makes. In this way, the management and support of IoT is a prevailing security 
challenge in longer terms.
In some cases, the IoT devices hold very little or no visibility into the internal func-
tion of the device or the data streams they produce. This makes the device vulnerable in 
such a way that it leads the user to believe an IoT device is performing certain functions 
when it might be undergoing undesirable data collection which the user does not intend 
to provide.
Previous models of IoT would be the products of large private or public technology 
enterprises, but in the future, the technologies with customized features and the ones 
built by the users themselves would be more prevalent as mentioned by Raspberry Pi60 
and Arduino developer communities. These technologies may or may not take the industry 
security standards into consideration.
The technology that we consume today is going to create a major disruption where 
people absolutely connect things and are becoming connected; we are going to see some 
fundamental changes in how we interact with the world, for example, People will be mov-
ing from the Internet to Consumption of things through Internet. The way the IoT is currently 
set up where huge content on the Internet is generated, people request for data over the 
Internet from uploading videos, writing, or whatever we are doing. There is a lot of really 
interesting second- and third-order effects to this—for one, it means that the Internet does 
not have any kind of objective view of the world—at best, it has an amalgamated set of 
subjective views, from which it can tease out what the real world is like.

11.2  Literature Review
If we consider the terms of the Internet facility and advancement of today, it was not dif-
ficult to make different computers communicate with each other and make them perform 
simple operations such as sending and receiving e-mails. We can think about intercon-
necting people, information, and systems. The emergence of miniaturized systems that are 
equally powerful, which can act independently and smartly due to the advanced ­software, 
empowers the concept that in many of the scenarios there might be implanted or linked 
processors responsible for its functioning.
In the IoT, resource-restrained elements are connected to the untrustworthy and unde-
pendable Internet via IPv6 and 6LoWPAN networks [1]. The wireless intrusions from both 
the Internet and the internal part of 6LoWPAN network are what make these suscepti-
ble to both external and internal attacks. The requirement of intrusion detection systems 
(IDSs) is considered to be necessary due to the probability of occurrence of these attacks.
Presently, due to the limitation of IDS approaches, which are being designed only for 
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) or traditional Internet, there is no IDS that can live up to 
the necessities of the IoT connected to IPv6.
In the work of Raza et al. [1], an innovative IDS for the IoT called SVELTE has been 
blueprinted, enacted, and assessed. In the execution and evaluation, the authors have fun-
damentally focused on attacks on the routing like imitation or alteration of information, 
sinkhole, and selective forwarding. However, they claim to extend the applicability of their 
designed system to detect other intrusions. They implement SVELTE in the Contiki OS 
and assess it profoundly. Their assessment depicts that in the simulated cases SVELTE 
spots all harmful nodes that initiate the executed sinkhole and/or forwarding intrusions 
with an accuracy rate of <100%, because of certain false notifications during the spotting. 
Figure 11.2 represents a general summary of the IDS, one of whose prime goals is that IDS 
should be lightweight and compatible with the processing abilities of the nodes. They also 
have enacted the idea of a distributed mini-firewall to secure the 6LoWPAN networks 
from the unauthorized users at a global level. They implement SVELTE in the Contiki 
operating system.

11.3  Authentication Using OTP Validation
The IoT apps require the establishment of more steps to recognize the relevant appliances. 
Keeping this in mind, the illustrated work has been proposed for applying the concept 
of using one time password (OTP) as a validation criterion so that only the users who are 
eligible to or authorized for logging into the system can do so.
With the help of this procedure, only the users who are authorized to do so would be 
able  to initiate the transmission and reception of the information after booting of the 
­system. The description is illustrated in Figure 11.3 [2].
The system accesses the IoT broker application by sending OTP request after booting 
with the help of regular Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) messaging.
The IoT app creates an OTP, delivers that to the system admin individually, and notifies 
it to the system. Once the OTP is entered into the system, it is sent to the broker application. 
The broker application then authenticates the OTP intimated by the system and responds 
with a notification of the successful or failed message (usually invalid OTP or session time-
out) back to the system. There is an allowance of trying the OTP validation again which 
depends on the number in the configuration of the retry counter. This further generates 
two cases:
	
1.	Successful OTP authentication even on retrying: This results in the shutting down of 
the application.
	
2.	The inability of OTP validation: This results in skipping of the OTP validation after 
initiation.

11.4  How Security Threats Affect the Users
As PCs and devices that work on the Internet have become smaller in size, faster in 
­functioning, and more connected, there has been an evolution in the threats in terms of 
security that has direct and indirect effects on the users.
With the assistance of developing cryptography and several protocols of security, we 
have also exploited that power to overcome those threats. There is a fight between the 
recently introduced threats and the recently introduced preventions and measures that 
counteract threats.
One of the factors that have a fundamental contribution to the security issues has been the 
Internet and its connectivity. When people had computers in a local setup that are usually 
accessed by a dial-up, the measures like passwords were enough to ensure the security. With 
the increasing outreach and coverage of the Internet, the chances of threat have increased and 
eventually the response demanded by that. Passive tags such as barcodes, quick response 
(QR) codes, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) are comparatively safer options as 
they are not prone to viral or malware-related attacks that degrade the functioning of the 
computer systems. The prime threat is in terms of accessibility of the information, that is, if 
a file can be read, then any user might be able to read that data and that can be used in any 
way by the user. The repercussions of this are determined by how convenient it is to obtain 
that information and how much value the information holds in terms of usefulness [1].
11.5  Security Requirements for the Internet of Secure Things
Some of the factors that the solution of security for embedded devices should ensure are 
that the device firmware has not been altered, damaged, or misused by malicious users 
and the device is secure from cyberattacks.
We should design the device in such a way that it includes security measures in its initial 
phases of modeling and prototyping. There is no definite formula that can solve the secu-
rity issues of all the embedded devices.
The security specifications should take into account the security execution charges, 
security failure expenditure, intrusion risks, and available intrusion vectors. The security 
features that should be taken into account are discussed in Table 11.1 [3].
11.6  Toward the Secure Solutions
Concepts representing the risks that increase the probability of intrusions in the IoT 
devices are discussed subsequently [4].
11.6.1  Emerging Hazards and Limitations

difficult implementation.

11.6.1.1  Blacklisting versus Whitelisting
Whitelisting took the place of blacklisting as it is easier to allow only what is necessary and 
deny the rest of the requests. It was better than the conventional antivirus techniques that 
would scan for malware in each and every input file. Whitelisting, on the contrary, only 
allows the authentic applications blocking every other one (http://searchsecurity.tech-
target.com/answer/Application-whitelisting-vs-blacklisting-Which-is-the-way-forward). 
Figure 11.4 is an illustration of blacklisting and whitelisting.
The blacklisting method is becoming more inefficient because of the increasing satura-
tion of malware. In order to update a blacklist, the services based on a cloud which accu-
mulates the data from several nodes because of which it becomes a less burdensome task 
to keep a whitelist.
However, there are certain functional constraints in maintaining an application whitelist 
when the conventional blacklist methodologies are proved to be less efficient. While 
whitelist holds the capability of blocking the unauthorized files and data from entering 
the system it is installed in, it can restrain the initial acceptance of the recent and more 
advanced methodologies and technologies.

Internet of Things (IoT)
Whitelisting is the pre-acceptance of the favorable and source instead of the denial of a 
pernicious one. Although there are some applications are derived from some new appli-
cations which that give rise to new applications which make it impracticable to detect 
by the whitelisting due to the lack of knowledge of dealing with it and its absence in the 
whitelisting database. In that case, the whitelisting would trust the application if it was 
originated and promoted by a trustworthy and ­reliable source, and it would be catego-
rized as trusted. This technique is termed as “Trust Chain” (https://blog.kaspersky.com/
wonders-of-whitelisting/6367/). There are certain variations in the algorithms blacklisting 
and whitelisting, which are shown in Figure 11.5.
11.6.2  Towards Safer Solutions
In order to overcome the limitations of the device functionalities, there is a need of 
a ­significant reconstruction and redesigning applying several evolved techniques of 
safety in IoT. For instance, a lot of storage space in RAM is needed for backlisting to 
fulfill the IoT applications. Figure 11.6 shows the way in which constituent parts of IoT 
are interrelated or arranged. The designing of embedded gadgets usually comes with 
constraints in terms of interconnection because of the silicon form factor not being large 
enough.
The vast diversity in IoT applications puts the security factor in jeopardy. The examples 
include:
A smart energy meter: The one that reports the energy consumption statistics to the 
­functional operator should be able to secure it from the revelation to an unauthenticated 
node. This report could be proved to be harmful of the house owner if it is disclosed to 
the ones with malicious intent as it would depict the house is vacant and would make it 
vulnerable to burglary.

11.7  The Domino Effect of IoT Safety
Several safety issues are originated in terms of IoT execution and its traits. Users are 
required to keep a certain level of faith and reliance with the confidence that the appli-
ances that use IoT are safe from the intruders to reduce the system’s information insurance, 
­peculiarly because this application has become more ubiquitous and well incorporated in 
our daily activities. The IoT appliances in which the security is compromised can cater 
various intrusions by attacking any of the components shown in Figure 11.7 and unli-
censed login. This increases the chances of data invasion by exposing the data networks 
with insufficient safeguarding.
The interlinked fashion of IoT services denotes that every appliance that is linked 
online has the capability to influence the security and the ability to withstand exter-
nal disturbances and internal collapses of the Internet worldwide. The factors such as 
software or hardware implementation of uniform IoT services or appliances, the auto-
connection features of certain IoT appliances with other appliances, and the probability 
of employing or running them in environments that are not well protected tend to 
enhance the potential vulnerability. Figure 11.8 lists the potential challenges in terms 
of IoT security.

The following are some of the challenges:
•	 The bringing of several IoT services into an effective action would include an 
assemblage of similar or sometimes indistinguishable appliances. This similar-
ity amplifies the influence of any possibility of the devices getting intruded by 
­outside devices having similar traits and functionalities.

IoT Challenges
Internet may expand to each design and prototype of the device that consid-
ers an identical set of rules of design or equivalent traits or functionalities of 
construction.
•	 The functioning of various IoT devices involves very scanty transparency level 
into its interior functions or the exact flow of information chain they generate. Due 
to this, the chances of the system security are likely or liable to be influenced or 
harmed, as the lack of transparency might lead the user to think that IoT is func-
tioning in a regular manner when it might be indulged in undesirable activities or 
accessing more information than what is required by the user. When the producer 
of the product incorporates an update in the product’s features, the functioning of 
the product can also undergo variations without any awareness increases in the 
user’s likelihood of the susceptibility in terms of security to any further variations 
introduced by the producer.
•	 One of the crucial factors to be considered when the IoT products/services are 
implemented or brought into action is physical security at all the times. The 
intruders might have chances to get their hands on the complete IoT system or one 
of its components directly. Anti-interfering characteristics and transformation to 
update the modeling and prototyping are required and must be to be taken into 
account in order to maintain security in such situations.
•	 Certain IoT services and products, smoke detectors, burglar alarms, temperature 
and humidity sensors, door switches, etc., are generated with an aim to be inte-
grated into the environment. Here, the user usually does not supervise the system 
in a continuous manner to check its functioning. Moreover, these systems may not 
have an explicit or direct technique to alarm the users whenever an issue regarding 
the safety is created. This increases the inconvenience for the user to be aware of 
any kind of intrusions arising.
•	 Due to both the versatility of the IoT devices and dynamic nature of the lifestyle of 
the users, there is no restriction on the number of IoT services. There is a need to 
establish an agreement of the extent of shared data and opted privacy settings to 
the services or systems using IoT, which can be created by building an efficacious 
technique that can withstand the enormous amount of IoT appliances having con-
trols that are elucidated by the users.
•	 Usually, a more conventional privacy design has been followed in which the 
users are supposed to choose the privacy options and settings by making infer-
ences based on the description given on the screen of the app. When we down-
load the apps from Play Store, the user is immediately asked to “accept and 
install.” A list of objects show up, which can be accessed by this particular 
app to perform the functions. IoT appliances generally do not offer the liberty 
of configuring privacy choices and settings because of the absence of the user 
interface. In several configurations of IoT, there is very little or no regulation or 
any kind of influence by the users over the method of accumulating and utiliz-
ing the information.
11.7.1  The Complications of a Security Hazard
Figure 11.9 presents the factors that pose a threat to the IoT security. These include 
Unprotected Network services, Cloud, mobile, an absence of security configuration, etc.

222
Internet of Things (IoT)
11.8  Bottom-Up Approach for Ensuring Security
The security of a device must be ensured throughout its course of development, from the 
early prototyping to the publishing phase and even further [4].
11.8.1  Security While Booting
When a system is started and put into a state of readiness for operation, the software on 
the gadget is validated on the basis of its credibility and authenticity with the help of 
cryptography by generating signatures or authentication log-in systems in a digital form.
Even though authentication has been made, there is still a requirement of securing the 
devices from intrusion during the period when a computer program is being executed.
11.8.2  Control over the Accessibility
This involves restricting the liberty of the devices and its constituents to only the relevant 
receivers by designing the OS access controls, which are data retrieval controllers based

IoT Challenges
on the roles integrated into the OS. The aim is to let these applications approach only the 
resources relevant to finish their tasks. In the case of intrusion of one element of the sys-
tem, this feature of control over the accessibility ensures that the attacker does not have 
any further access to the system or the access is kept to a minimum. Even if the attacker 
somehow gets a hand to the classified information of a certain company or institution by 
obtaining the login details of, say, an employee or an internal staff member, the informa-
tion leaked should be restrained to only the parts of the network that are given official 
permission for or approval to only those login details. This above concept illustrates that 
the effect of an intrusion can be kept to a bare minimum only if sufficient details needed 
to accomplish a task are permitted.
11.8.3  Certification/Validation of Appliances
Every time an appliance is connected to a network, it should be able to check the validation 
on its own before any type of exchange of information. The integrated systems usually 
do not have manual functioning with the provision of users entering the details needed 
to login into the network. This makes it difficult to confirm recognition rightly before 
sanctioning authority. The verification process of user identity trying to access the system 
with the help of machines provides access to an appliance to a network on the basis of an 
equivalent set of login details allocated in a safe space.
This is exactly like how user authorization by comparing their credentials with the 
­provided database on the local OS or within the corporate server has a provision of allow-
ing users to acquire a network of an institute with the required authentication credentials.
11.9  Secure Framework of the IoT Related to Perceptual Layer [5]
The IoT possesses traits that involve certain risks: innate/built-in exposure, diversity, 
and exposure to the possibility of being attacked or harmed at the end nodes. For this 
reason, a novel framework needs to be introduced to check the security breach. This 
framework should focus on enhancing the efficacy, dependability, accountability, and 
regulation in the overall structure that checks the security issues. This must also address 
almost all technologies relevant to security and confirm effective compatibility of sev-
eral mechanisms of safety. The following proposed work addresses all potential threats 
to the IoT system and suggests relevant security methodologies. This proposal contains 
a blueprint of worldwide two-dimensional (2D) secure framework of security embed-
ded with relevant safety technologies. The IoT is a more compendious association of the 
nexus which is more effective, witty, and strong, rendering IoT the benefits over other 
applications used for sensing which was prevailed in the past. There is a lot to develop 
in the field of IoT implementation as the exploration of security challenges regarding IoT 
is still insufficient.
However, the complications of the IoT segregate the associated facets of the exploration 
in this field. Besides, the secure path, recognition of attacks on the system, the incognito 
privacy, the established process of trust and credence, and other features and aspects are 
disparate. This is why there is a dire need for a long-term introduction and acceptance of 
a novel, more advanced framework that could address most of the technology to ascertain 
the functioning of several security processes together without having to make alterations 

224
Internet of Things (IoT)
for successful working and effectively enhancing the resilience, regulation, dependability, 
and accountability of the whole system. Taking into account that the biggest gap between 
IoT and the web remains in the ability to interpret or become aware of something through 
senses, the secure framework with a bottom-up approach is presented for consideration 
with features which are aligned to the perceptual layer. A set of application requirements 
is presumed to be fulfilled by this framework.
11.9.1  Challenges Posed in IoT Security
The application threats existing in the IoT are closely associated with its application 
domain. A comprehensive argument is given below.
11.9.1.1  Perceptual Layer Security Threats
In the perceptual activity layer, sensory activity nodes sometimes build an ad hoc network 
with a dynamic distribution. Given restricted node resources, dynamic modification in 
configuration, and dispersed systematic structure, the most threats that come from the 
sensory activity layer are the following:
	
a.	Manual annexure: Many nodes are steadily installed in the place and can simply be 
seized by intruders and thus are physically jeopardized.
	
b.	Brute force invasion: The capability of storage of related amenities along with the 
computation of the perceptual node is restricted and is highly probable to face 
brute force invasion.
Number of combinations = Possible character (password string length)
11.9.1.1.1  How Brute Force Intrusions Function
A brute force intrusion follows the cryptography algorithm. The attackers who hack into 
the system have knowledge of the password and user name saved in an organized reposi-
tory of the system. So when the users try to sign in and the request of their page is trans-
mitted from the server side to the client system, these intruders are more operational to 
hack into the account. These attackers know that there exists an encrypted key through 
which the password and other details required to login can be made intelligible. So they 
try to access the full functionality or data of the system by obtaining the password or 
another form of authentication from the coded information. They achieve this by trying 
all the combinations that are possible to login into the system. The hackers use the set of 
coded instructions on the computer for the automatic performance of the task to retrieve 
the password and other confidential details. They take help of the highly efficient, quick 
computer systems that are programmed to calculate lengthy problems in very short time. 
This brute force intrusion (Figure 11.10) functions with digits, numerals, special symbols, 
and characters and combines them to match with the combination required to login and 
unlock the account.
11.9.1.2  Blocking of Brute Force Attack
A brute force invasion is proved to be dangerous for the operators at the nodes. This 
intrusion takes up a lot of space allocation, time, and resources; however, if we manage 
www.ebook3000.com

225
IoT Challenges
to execute certain security measures, then it would make it less susceptible for attack-
ers to use this force to hack into the user’s system. Some of the precautionary measures 
would be:
•	 Having a complex (e.g., alphanumeric or a mix of special symbols) or lengthy 
password.
•	 Restrict the number of attempts to sign into the account. And in the case of 
­failure to log in within the given limits, the account should be provisionally 
inaccessible. For instance, when one enters the incorrect password multiple 
times in a Gmail login, there is a CAPTCHA code automatically sent along with 
a request to enter the text in the image sent which is system generated (as shown 
in the screenshot in Figure 11.11). This is done to check whether the password 
is being entered on its own or is being entered by the human robotically, which 
Gmail is unaware of.
11.9.1.3  Clone Node
The hardware framework of various perceptual end points of an equipment, such as a 
computer or peripheral, attached to a network is not very complicated and, therefore, 
is susceptible to be duplicated by the hackers.

11.9.1.4  Impersonation of the User to Access the Account
The authorization in the dispersed setting or conditions in which a certain proceeding is 
being occurred is veritably tough to achieve for the perceptual end point. This facilitates 
the intruders at the nodes with malevolent intent to attack using the identification details 
imitated with fraud means.
11.9.1.5  Routing Attack
Data forwarding and transmission of information or a message occurs during the accu-
mulation of perceptual information. This is what gives a chance to the information 
transmitted through the medial points to be intruded while it is being redirected further 
ahead.

IoT Challenges
11.9.1.6  Denial-of-service (DoS) Attack [6]
It is the kind of attack where the access to a system or a certain network is denied by the 
users and the culprit misuses this unauthorized access. It could be for the purpose of ter-
minating an ongoing or upcoming process of a host linked with the Internet for an unlim-
ited or unspecified period of time. This condition of DoS can be achieved by inundating 
the aimed system or device with surplus and redundant requests in order to overload it 
and block the permissible and authorized requests from being acknowledged and enter-
tained. The analogy drawn could be a scenario where the entrance to a particular door to a 
shop is jammed by the crowd and does not allow the authorized people who are supposed 
to get into the shop, thus interrupting the regular and smooth functioning of the shop. 
Figure 11.12 illustrates the distributed denial of service (DDoS) intrusion framework.
DoS intrusions are featured by a distinct effort by the hackers in order to cause hin-
drance to the authorized users for using the particular system. There are two kinds of DoS

intrusions: one that makes the system processes fail and one that inundates the system 
processes. The distributed attacks are the most damaging ones [6].
11.9.1.7  Node Privacy Leak
Hackers can directly or indirectly steal compromising data in the end point. The devices 
at home are situated at particular places and, instead of attacking them, the hackers try to 
immorally obtain the information stored in those devices. They use a guerrilla approach to 
take over the minor parts of someone’s system by eventually influencing the functioning 
of the network [7].
Furthermore, the hardware framework for certain perceptual end points is very straight-
forward and uncomplicated, which gives a chance for the hackers to duplicate it. Because of 
the restriction of the resources at the nodes, the dispersed framework, this perceptual layer 
results in several damages, including annexing it manually, being jeopardized by annexation.
11.10  An Innovative Framework for IoT Security [8]
Keeping the security challenges in mind, we suggest an interesting framework for the 
IoT security after the analysis of the secure framework needs. The secure framework 
­suggested consists of four layers (see Figure 11.13).

1.	Data Perception Layer 
	
	 A major problem is to come up with a prototype which is not very heavy for man-
aging this layer in the IoT. Some of the safety safeguards incorporated in this par-
ticular layer are listed in the following:
	
a.	 Safe routing
	
b.	 Supervision and command of the key
	
c.	 Recognition when the attack occurs
	
d.	 Conversion of information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access
	
2.	Varied and Divergent Network Access Layer
	
	 A means or process of ensuring the authenticity of the user accessing the data 
must be integrated into all kinds of devices irrespective of their complexity level. 
The precautions included in this layer mainly consist of:
	
a.	 Security and seclusion of user data
	
b.	 Integrity of the information
	
c.	 Authorization for the users while logging in
	
d.	 Safety measures while accessing
	
e.	 Encryption of the confidential information
	
3.	Information Management Layer
	
	 To deal with an enormous amount of data and the decision-making taking into 
account the nature of the connections, firmly setting up the techniques for super-
vision and assessment of trust and achieving efficacious ­mining have to be scru-
tinized for the information security techniques. Keeping this in mind, this layer 
would consist of the ­resistance mechanisms as follows:
	
a.	 Information metric
	
b.	 Behavior elements authorization
	
c.	 Key production and dispensation
	
d.	 Calculation of security factors and values
	
4.	Smart Service Layer
	
	 To yield an appropriate security facility for a particular user on the basis of his or 
her requirements, suitable accuracy should be established for various applications.
	
a.	 Regulation of access and its organization.
	
b.	 Organization of security.
	
c.	 Methodologies to security of confidentiality.
	
d.	 Figure 11.13 shows the IoT framework and factors that should be taken into 
account for the security.
11.11  Security Authentication and Confirmation System
In this section, we discuss the structuring of a security authentication system in the field 
of IoT.

11.11.1  System Framework
The nodes at the endpoints of the 3G network: RESTful Web Services that are the web 
services based on REST framework, that is, if surpassed the user verification proce-
dure. All the resources work as a source in the REST framework. Figure 11.14 illustrates 
the functioning of the REST approach between the client and the server.
The security authentication and confirmation system consists of four layers:
•	 Perception Layer Appliances (Figure 11.15):
	
This layer would include the sensors of factors such as temperature, the 
­component of a television signal which carries information on the brightness 
of the image. Two AA rechargeable batteries are used for the source of power.
•	 Heterogeneous Network Access Layer Appliances:
	
The smart Gateway with two AA rechargeable batteries or a USB connecting wire 
is used for the source of power.

11.12  Conclusion
As we increasingly connect the devices to the Internet, it gives new opportunities to the 
development of cyberattacks by letting the malicious users to make the device malfunction 
or reprogram the devices. Sometimes, due to the cost being competitive or the existence of 
certain technical constraints, it becomes challenging for the manufacturers to include the 
features which would be adequate to check the probable security breaches.

Internet of Things (IoT)
Along with potential security design deficiencies, the increase in the number of IoT 
devices could invite the opportunities to attack the systems. Every device with compro-
mised security that is connected online has a potential to affect the resilience of Internet 
on a global level in case of its high interconnection.
Many IoT devices are designed in such a way that they could be deployed in a huge 
amount in the market, far more than the traditional Internet-connected devices. It results in 
the creation of unparalleled interconnected links in terms of quantity. This would call for a 
new consideration of the existing methods and tools as many of these Internet-connected 
devices would become capable of establishing communication with other devices they are 
connected to in an unpredictable and undesirable manner. Moreover, the homogeneous 
nature of IoT deployments resulting from a collection of similar functioning devices pos-
sessing the same characteristics would amplify the effect of each one of the connected 
points or devices.
The effective and appropriate security solutions can be achieved in many ways.
One of the suitable and efficacious solutions to the security concern lies in applying 
a collaborative security model which serves as an effective approach. This collaborative 
model has served as an effective approach for all the authorities using IoT services in order 
to help them safeguard the cyberspace and the Internet, including the IoT. The model con-
sists of effective tools and a variety of practices which include the sharing of information 
(i.e., bidirectional and consensual); preparedness from the incidents and cyber exercises; 
consenting to certain international behavioral norms, recognition, and improvement of 
international practices and standards; training; and awareness creation. The assistance of 
consistent efforts would eventually lead to the evolution of collaborative approaches based 
on the shared management of all the probable risks which would appropriately match the 
complexity and scale of the possible security challenges posed by the IoT devices in future.
IoT is going to give the Internet a more objective way of gathering data, meaning that 
the conclusions that will be drawn by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
algorithms are potentially going to be very different from what we expect. It is also means 
that the scale and quality of decisions being made by virtual agents are going to become 
an order of magnitude better than what it is today.
11.13  Future Scope
IoT is an emerging field add-on of the Internet. Thus, the design, security, and privacy 
issues on the Internet inherit the IoT.
•	 With the development of the IoT, different wireless communication technologies 
and network infrastructures are continuously integrated, including WSN, RFID 
systems, mobile vehicle network, 3G technology, WIMAX, PAN, etc. Even though 
with the emerging connecting technologies like IPV6 which has a mandatory 
Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) with it, the security of IoT is still a matter due 
to various attacks. The nature of IoT, that is, dynamic (i.e., ability to connect any 
new object into the existing network and a variety of communication techniques) 
is also a reason for the security issues in IoT than in other fields such as WSN and 
mobile ad hoc.

IoT Challenges
•	 Since the corresponding communication network environment has become more 
complex and the security issues involved are more complex than any existing net-
work infrastructures, the things in IoT should have inbuilt device authentication 
and encryption using the lightweight cryptographic protocols. Public key infra-
structure (PKI) should be there in IoT environment and the damage to the devices 
should be also addressed.
•	 The security should be enabled in the technologies which should ensure that there 
is no tag collision problem. This chapter proposes a novel network secure frame-
work that can be adapted to the future IoT and finally gives details for the security 
verification system design.
•	 We can introduce the sensors that are reliable enough for the users in case of 
emergencies, power failures, and other electricity issues. With this, we can move 
toward more healthy technological solutions which can take care of the patient’s 
health.
•	 Issues such as sudden heart attacks, silent deaths, can be reduced if the real-time 
notification features are included in the IoT devices. For example, building the 
wearable body sensors that can notify the nearest hospitals in case of abnormali-
ties in the patient’s body can help in providing ambulance service and emergency 
aid to the patient.
•	 The new home automation systems can be advanced in the sense that the whole 
idea of physical switches can be eliminated. This can be achieved by directly 
connecting the home appliances with IoT appliances and sensors so that these 
appliances can function on their own without being dependent on us. This would 
decrease the chance of electric shocks and other related household accidents.
•	 In future, it is pretty clear exactly how IoT will look; the next 20 years is a known 
unknown to us.

Internet of Things (IoT)
12.1  Introduction
As a society, we have come a long way since the World Wars and pre-independent India, 
when food for survival was itself a question. Millions died due to famine and lack of food. 
Mortality due to hunger has come down, except in a few countries. Human lifespan has 
increased by 30 years in the last century. One of the best inventions made by man after 
fire and wheel is TOILET. Our modern toilet dates back not more than 250 years. In 1775 
Alexander Cummings invented the S-trap, which is still in use. Toilet discovery needs 
highlighting because it helped to reduce infection level in the community, even before 
antibiotics were discovered.
12.1.1  Occurrence of Diseases and Scope of the Internet of Things
Environment: There is no simple theory to explain how diseases occur; for our purposes 
the following paradigm is more than adequate. Interaction between the host (man), agent 
(living and nonliving), and the environment is called the epidemiological triad. Figure 12.1 
shows this truth (Krieger 2001).
To raise a plant, seed and mud alone are not sufficient. Somebody has to water it. Similarly 
host–agent interaction alone will not cause disease. Facilitating environment is crucial. As 
a corollary it is just not enough to deal with host and agent alone to cure illness, but the 
environmental contribution has also to be corrected, which is precisely not done by physi-
cians. To deal with environment, intersectoral coordination, by various segments of the soci-
ety is urgently required. Without the intervention on the environmental factor, diseases 
are bound to persist leading to various conditions like drug resistance, increased mortality 
from diseases like tuberculosis, etc. Such events can be prevented by primary health care, 
which has three pillars, viz. equity, community participation, and intersectoral coordina-
tion. Internet of things (IoT) is one such intersectoral coordination.

Non-Physician Primary Healthcare Workers
12.1.2  Control of Communicable Diseases with Environment 
Manipulation and Anti-Microbials
The day we started to understand that the disease has a relationship with hygiene, toilets 
were invented, antibiotics followed, vaccines were developed, etc. New way of healthcare 
delivery became prominent over all the existing practices, which in many circumstances 
were not scientific. In 1824, first public toilets were introduced in Paris. Subsequent decades 
saw the birth of epidemiology, which proved the relationship of all diseases is with the 
environment.
Eradication of infectious diseases became easy as we understood the bacteria and virus 
more and more. Antibiotics and painkillers changed the very practice of medicine, by 
providing more ammunition in the physician’s bag. Of course the science of medicine fur-
ther progressed in the area of surgical treatment and issues related to child birth. All 
these contributed to the extension of human life by 30 years. But any further improvement 
in longevity and quality of human life is becoming a bigger question and certainly not 
possible in the near future. The life-span extension has been achieved by only curtailing 
the communicable diseases, and controlling the contribution by non-communicable dis-
eases was virtually nil. Chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiac issues, neurological issues, 
psychology, oncology, etc., which are popularly called lifestyle diseases of the twentieth 
century, have to be controlled to improve the quality of life.
12.1.3  Matching Health Budget to Disease Levels—Neither Possible nor Necessary
In India there are around 14,00,000 hospital beds and we need 2.5 times more beds to meet 
world average and at least 20 times to meet Japan’s standards. The average cost of creating 
a hospital bed is approximately Rs. 50 lakhs [24], including the infrastructure and opti-
mal equipments inventory. That works out an investment of Rs 60,000 crores each year 
for the next 20 years [25]. Current healthcare budget by government is Rs 30,000 crores, 
which itself is few times more than previous years. This being the case, investment for 
constructing the hospital beds looks practically impossible for now. We need alternative 
technology in place [26]. Although we need physicians and hospitals in place immediately, 
we neither have time or money waiting for. Fortunately, we have 106 crore cell phone con-
nections [27] for 74 crore adults (aged between 15 and 64 years) [28]. There are 46 crore 
internet users, and this is growing at 30 to 50% every year [29]. We have 1.4 cell phones per 
adult and 0.6 internet connection per adult. By 2020 India will have one internet connec-
tion per each adult [30]. All these happen without any investment from the health budget. 
Monitoring the health can be done with right application, right platform, along with the right IoT 
sensors connected to the experienced and sophisticated regional tertiary healthcare centers.

Internet of Things (IoT)
Also we can maximize the use of precise talents to get the correct solution even to the 
remotest location on time. This also helps to teach and train the next generation of physi-
cians and paramedical staff more effectively.
12.1.4  Transition from Symptom-Based Treatment to Personalized Treatment
Today the solution toward health issues is just symptom based or based on blood tests 
or imaging studies. The causes of such diseases are yet to be established well with each 
individual, i.e., cause can only be generalized, and cannot be pinpointed as to why it 
has occurred in the individual. We need to move from symptom-based management to 
prevention and prediction, to bring out a cost-effective solution. This is called prognosis 
and has to be individualized. Thus we have a different set of issues to be solved, requir-
ing different set of tools to capture, analyze, and prognosticate the outcome. We need to 
understand the personal needs of the patient, his/her genetic background, family sur-
roundings, socio-economic challenges faced by the individual, the required behavioral 
change to prevent the illness, etc. Big data analysis is required for predicting the risk 
factors for each individual.
12.1.5  Placing the Responsibility with the Patient Himself/
Herself—Primary Health Care
In the decades of struggle, awareness to our own body is becoming better, but limited to 
few set of learned people. The actual responsibility of health has to be with the patient himself 
which is one of the eight principles of primary health care. It is time that he/she is empowered 
with such information in the right way to bring in the next big shift in healthcare. To 
achieve this, he/she needs an electronic health record (EHR) and gadgets to help him/her 
monitor his/her health indices and trained medical people to help him/her. These per-
sonnel need not be physicians. But they must capture the information with the specialist 
capabilities through EHR and gadgets. The healthcare system can take up the responsibil-
ity of continuously informing or predicting the healthcare status of each individual based 
on his/her responses or behaviors, affecting his/her health.
12.1.6  Monitoring Vital Signs through Sensors
There are many symptoms a person can feel and experience, but a few critical and vital 
parameters cannot be felt by a person; however, through IoT it can be monitored easily 
on a continuous basis. Well-documented examples include pulse, blood pressure, and 
body temperature. These measured parameters are remotely read and interpreted by an 
expert on a live basis and opinion on this reaches back to the person, while he continues 
to do his/her daily routine at a remote place. This is called healthcare anywhere, anytime. 
This will permanently change the landscape of healthcare system, for insurance compa-
nies, pharmaceutical industry, policymakers as well as for healthcare workers, above all 
patients themselves.
It is possible with the age of IoT. Various sensors are fixed to the body as wearable sen-
sors, using low-energy radio frequency signals. The signals are sent to a nearby mobile 
device, through which the measured signal is sent to a remote cloud server through the 
Internet. There the required algorithms are applied and re-transmitted to the required 
people anywhere across the globe. An intelligent interpretation brings the report back 
to the person on whom the measurements were made. This completes the entire cycle.

Non-Physician Primary Healthcare Workers
It is almost like carrying an expert physician along anywhere, anytime. Today with the 
advancement of nanotechnology, information communication technology maturing, the 
Internet becoming pervasive, all the citizens having a mobile device with them, quality of 
life can certainly be improved.
In this paper we record our ultimate objective as empowering the patient and at the same time 
amplifying the physician’s strength. The concept is further explored with diabetes as an exam-
ple in which failure of current system and the proposed model are explained. Working of 
FEVERWATCH®, a wearable computational device, is explained and its role in the community. 
It can be used in more than 15 situations. Five essential phases for success of IoT in this coun-
try are enumerated. Three ‘Is’ (3I), information, intelligent, and instant decisions, are pos-
sible through sensors. EHRs will be the backbone for such changes using IoT devices in the 
country. The current problems in health information system in the country are explained. 
Complex process of development in EHR is described using HELYXON® software, which can 
also be used as a mobile application by the patients. The problems with traditional software 
and the advantages of INDIVO Open Source EHR are explained along with other technical 
details. The various features, such as how parents use it at home, paramedicals at front desk, 
and the physician in the consulting room, are explained with particular reference to symp-
tom analysis, growth monitoring, immunization, and non-visit consultation with the physi-
cian. The scope for paramedical workers is further discussed with references. Finally the 
barriers, challenges, and the road ahead for use of wearable computational devices and EHRs 
are discussed and the solutions tried out in Chennai and Vellore are presented.
12.2  Objective
The main objective is to create an integrated and collaborative healthcare platform that 
empowers the poor and rich, and the urban and rural population alike. The solution 
addresses the core problem of severe shortage of physicians, specialists, and inadequate 
healthcare delivery mechanisms. The solution should be highly secured healthcare net-
working portal along with the IoT sensors and mobile application that allows registered 
consumers to create their profiles, upload electronic healthcare records (both live and 
offline), create their own care groups, and share selected information with care groups. 
It should help the end user to connect with healthcare providers and clinical laboratory 
personnel, pharmaceuticals, etc. Using smart sensors, smart hardware and software, 
network, and data science, all these are possible.
12.2.1  Explanation of the Core Problem with the Very Common Example: Diabetes
Complicated and expensive goods and services in their early days are beyond the reach of 
the poor. IoT in general, particularly in health care, has not developed widely, meaning it 
is yet to become a way of life for many people and things. Any industry in early stages is 
almost always appears to be complicated. As a corollary, it becomes expensive and on the 
other hand only the well-trained people can use it. Computers and photocopying machines 
in their early days are everyday examples to comprehend the meaning of “only the rich can 
afford it and the well-trained expert can use it.” As the years pass by, the gadgets become 
cheaper, at the same time, becoming more versatile enabling even an ordinary person with 
a little training to get experiences that were never thought a generation ago.

240
Internet of Things (IoT)
India has the maximum number of diabetic patients, it appears at an earlier age, and 
its complication is far reaching when compared to western nations. In the early twenti-
eth century, before the advent of insulin, diabetes was an acute illness, meaning once 
diagnosed they had a short lifespan and died of complications. Now diabetic acute com-
plications are well managed, making diabetes a chronic disease. As a chronic case, man-
agement of diabetes by the medical world is poor, and far too many progress to kidney 
failure, develop heart attacks and strokes, and lose their sight and limbs due to the vas-
cular complications.
We know the science of diabetes up to the molecular level. We have trained physicians 
to take this understanding to the patient. We have patients who can afford the drugs or 
as in the state of Tamil Nadu, government hospitals providing free insulin injections. We 
have laboratory facilities to do blood sugar even in villages at primary healthcare centers. 
Yet the disease is not controlled. Complication incidence (number of new ones appearing 
every year) is increasing. From where does the problem come from?
There are many dimensions, but the single most reason is that the disease has so 
many components, no single physician can document, let alone mange all of them. But 
a network of physicians and paramedical workers can handle it more appropriately. 
Enlarging the diabetes example, the first step in management of diabetes is the diag-
nosis of the disease. Diagnosis is made by the symptom or complication of diabetes 
e.g., foot ulcer—by the physician or by the laboratory test done for some other problem 
or as a screening test. After diagnosis, it is screening for complications: eye checkup, car-
diac assessment, cholesterol level, and kidney function measurement. After that, based 
on the individual’s body constitution and the complications present, drugs are chosen. 
If it is not controlled, insulin injection is given. Lifestyle modification in the form of 
exercise and avoidance of smoking and alcohol is stressed. An exhaustive diet charting 
is done including what to be avoided, what can be liberally taken, what can be taken in 
moderation. Patient education like care of the foot and careful execution of simple pro-
cedures like nail cutting are stressed.
In vast majority of health centers, diabetes is managed only by the physicians, who are 
at the top of healthcare hierarchy. They concentrate only on bio-medical aspects, and not 
stressing the other components, mainly because of lack of time availability. Suppose we 
train the paramedical workers to carry out the work missed by physicians, complications 
can be greatly reduced. Here comes the comprehensive health record and smart gadgets 
to assist them. Physicians can then delegate work, which can be done easily by paramedi-
cal workers. This is happening in exclusively diabetic hospitals, particularly in the city 
of Chennai.
This delegation has the following components:
	
1.	Domains which can be delegated are basic general information, diet, exercise, and 
lifestyle modifications.
	
2.	These “modules” must have evidence-based guidelines. The guidelines if adopted 
scientifically should give measurable outcomes, which can be validated.
	
3.	All these have to be “caught” systematically in a health record, which can be trans-
ported along with the patient. The entry in them should be legible in a standard 
format. When the patient leaves the primary physician, he/she should not fumble 
at the second hospital.
	
4.	Several checklists for the diabetic are once a year, eye check-up; once in 3 months, 
hemoglobin A1c measurement; before retiring to the bed, wash the feet and look

241
Non-Physician Primary Healthcare Workers
for any injury, etc. A system has to be maintained for prompting and confirming 
that these are done.
	
5.	The drugs have complications which have to be monitored regularly.
Needless to say that such a system is not possible, with current methods in healthcare 
delivery and hence complications are rising.
12.2.2  Relationship with Paramedical Workers, EHRs, and Gadgets
	
1.	If a physician does not have time, it has been clearly proved beyond doubt that 
paramedical workers can share and complete their work. Several evidences are 
presented later.
	
2.	Now the next step is to maintain a record, which should be simple and which can be 
used by paramedical workers and the patient themselves, with physician contribu-
tion limited to biomedical aspects, beyond the capacity of paramedical workers.
	
3.	The third and final step is to create gadgets which can embed the physician expe-
rience, knowledge, and skill effectively and simply so that the paramedical worker 
and patient themselves can use it. 
	
	   Figure 12.2 explains the objective of this relationship between the patient, physi-
cian, and the paramedical worker.

12.2.4  Why Do We Need to Choose “Child Health”?
Simple, everybody likes children. Not even a criminal would bear to see a child suffering. 
Beyond the emotional aspect, child health is complicated by several factors. And, in the 
first year of life, children are brought to the hospital four to seven times for immunization 
purposes alone. Moreover, children tend to fall sick often, from 6 to 18 months of life.
12.2.5  Use of Wearable Computational Medical Devices by Paramedical Workers
HELYXON® has built the capability to develop Bluetooth-based IoT product for monitor-
ing body temperature continuously from remote, called FEVERWATCH®. Though called 
as FEVERWATCH®, it is opposite; hypothermia monitoring is vital in the new born period, 
and this instrument can save lives in those situations.
	
1.	The instrument consists of an IoT sensor, cloud server, and a smart application, 
which works on any iOS/android mobile devices, like phone, pod, pad, etc.
	
2.	The sensor is attached to the body of the baby using a plaster at the appropri-
ate location and it can accurately measure body temperature and communicate 
the same to the application on the mobile device through Bluetooth (Bluetooth 
version 4.0/Bluetooth low energy: BLE).
	
3.	The data are continuously recorded at the sensor and application, and data/alert 
is sent to a remotely monitoring person via cloud server. Figure 12.3 schematically 
represents this fact.

Features:
	
1.	24/7—continuous wireless remote monitoring.
	
2.	Multipatient, simultaneous monitoring in hospital environment.
	
3.	No loss of data, even when user with sensor moves away from the Bluetooth range.
	
4.	Pre-settable alarm range for hyper-/hypothermia.
	
5.	Directly computable data provide reliable temperature trend in graphical form.
	
6.	Data and graph can be mailed, stored, and printed.
	
7.	Shareable and reusable.
12.2.6  Role of Continuous Temperature Measurement in 
the Community by Paramedical Workers
	
1.	There are exceedingly high rates of resistance of Gram-negative bacilli to almost 
all antibiotics (Giuliano KK 2006).
	
	   Several reasons for this can be cited. In the community setting, fever without focus 
is treated with antibiotics by all and sundry, including parents. The single most rea-
son cited is the fever phobia. “If something bad happens…, so we give antibiotics.”
	
	   This fear can be greatly reduced if temperature is monitored every second and 
the same is sent to both parents and the treating physician. The treating physician 
can fix his upper limit and can be messaged. The very thought that the child is 
remotely monitored by the medical team gives immense relief to the mother.
	
2.	So is the case of febrile seizures, where every shake of the child makes the parents 
wide awake.
	
3.	Last 20 years have seen the use of transplants and home management of leukemia 
going up.
	
	   The single most predictor of early infection in this class is the rise in temperature 
or its opposite hypothermia. Febrile neutropenic patient numbers are also going up.
	
4.	For want of beds, people, including children and the elderly, are discharged with 
an intravenous cannula in the forearm. They usually complete the antibiotic 
course at home. They visit the nearest healthcare facility once or twice daily. The 
one sure, noninvasive way of managing them is to record temperature.
	
5.	India is becoming the preferred destiny for research and vaccine evaluation. The 
temperature monitoring in those cases expands the role of FEVERWATCH®.
	
6.	Regarding temperature measurement in seizures, febrile seizure is differentiated from 
epilepsy on the basis of temperature. If temperature does not rise, within 24 hours 
of onset of fits, then we can conclude it to be afebrile seizure, possibly epilepsy.
	
7.	Infrastructure-related issues like logistics management severely affect the health-
care outcome, especially vaccination/organ transplantation movements. Cold 
chain management as well as the refrigerators at each practitioner’s place, where 
power supply is erratic, needs proper continuous monitoring.
	
8.	Other community use is in hostels. During fever cases, question arises, to treat the 
inmates in hostel or at hospital or send them home, preventing the illness spread-
ing to other children. Selectively, the students can be sent home or hospitalized or 
monitored in the hostel by paramedics.

244
Internet of Things (IoT)
	
9.	Now that we have special ambulances for neonatal transport, FEVERWATCH® 
becomes inevitable in such situations, to monitor hypothermia (Kumar V et al. 2009).
	 10.	Exercise among elderly patients will need temperature monitoring, along with 
pulse and blood pressure.
	 11.	Infertility management by closely observing basal body temperature using 
FEVERWATCH® can be another compelling use requirement among youngsters, 
to find out ovulation time.
	 12.	Remote monitoring of the postoperative patient after discharge, especially for 
medical tourism, patients who have come long way.
	
	 In the second phase, FEVERWATCH® can be expanded to monitor blood pressure, 
partial pressure of oxygen, pulse rates, which could then be transmitted along 
with temperature.
From Box 12.1, everything except the fourth point is already being done in an isolated 
way. We right now need a reliable solution to monitor the required vital parameters and 
essentials—temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Based on this, if a 
physician continuously communicates to the patient, then the dependency of the patient 
to that particular physician becomes higher and higher. The mind share of the patient is 
fully occupied with that physician and the loyalty with that physician grows up. If the first 
phase of above-mentioned five steps doesn’t work, then after certain telephonic follow-
up we need to move on to phase 3, where a paramedic/a physician visit the home for the 
physical examination. Phase 3 asks the patient to come to a hospital for further examina-
tions/disease management. As a final step, an exhaustive examination, diagnostic efforts, 
and reconfirmation are done before attempting the right therapy/surgery. In all these, the 
first key point is to ensure that the patient is resting all the while, and his/her systems are 
kept most comfortable to take on the fight against the disease more effectively. Everything 
else is put on second priority. If this process is going to be good only for the rich, how can 
we enable it for the poor and the needy? After all health and human life are invaluable to 
anyone, there is no rich or poor here.
BOX 12.1  FIVE ESSENTIAL PHASES TO OCCUR IN IoT 
TO SUCCEED IN HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY
	
1.	A known physician/a set of physicians need to be made available all the time 
for a 24/7 any time connect. This brings both trust and confidence for the 
person to move forward in life with fewer worries.
	
2.	Remote connect for easy conversation through video-conferencing using the 
readily available gadgets and freely available applications.
	
3.	A sharable demography, past history, medical record, etc. in a repository 
under patient’s control for any authorized physician to view it instantly.
	
4.	All past and current vital and essential parameters available live to verify, 
track, or provide alert. This provides decision-making easier and symptoms-
based approach.
	
5.	Upon remote consultation, the medicines automatically reach the home 
through a pre-arranged system.

FEVERWATCH® is one of the first baby steps toward creating that new environment a 
real possibility. The best of the healthcare delivery is practiced at intensive care unit (ICU). 
Significant difference between ICU, the place of best care, and outside being the ability to 
continuously monitor vital parameters of the patient and intervene instantly.
Movie = 1,000 Pictures and each picture is 1,000 words = A movie is million words 
(1,000 × 1,000)
Continuous monitoring = multiple instant direct measurement is 1,000 times better than 
relying on Patient’s narration = Continuous monitoring is million times better than patient’s 
expression about symptoms.
12.2.7  Depending upon the Anxiety and Communication 
Capability There Can Be Misguidance to Physician
Each individual is a complicated unique system and relying purely upon the patient’s 
expressions can be misleading and can complicate things even more. There should be a 
matured system for physicians to rely upon to take decisions. Today’s patients demand 
more than what can be delivered.
12.2.8  How About Making the Continuous Monitoring of Vital Parameters a 
Possibility at Pocket Level? (Fayyoumi et al. 2014; Mare and Kotz 2010; 
Zhu et al. 2015)
At the outset it looks like it is practically impossible for physician to go through all details 
to make a decision, even if we are going to invent new kind of sensors and gadgets to gen-
erate stream of measured data. This overwhelming amount of data is going to throw the 
entire current system out of gear; no one has time to review such a huge data for making 
decisions.
12.2.9  The 3I (Figure 12.4)
Consider we have an algorithm and if it can help physician in making Instant/Informed/ 
Intelligent decisions. The 3I. Physicians need to focus on handling the patient and not going 
through the piles of report of the past and current issues. As the technology advances 
more and more fragmented information about the patients keeps pouring in. The chances 
of losing piles of information are higher. Being the case he/she needs a new tool; we call 
it as 3I. Physician gets more time to build relationship with patient and such a decision-
making tool is the need of the hour. It is like autopilot feature assisting an expert pilot. 
This helps the physician to move out of current practice of treating the patient through 
perceived symptoms to more scientific, evidence-based decisions. This for sure will lead 
to a new kind of sigh and relief to the patient as well as the physician and also build a path 
for the trust between them.
Figure 12.5 illustrates that there is no physical entry of data; all data are directly computable 
with high security and integrity.
Patient, practitioner, and payer all are in single platform. Using this readily available 
technological platform, we defy the current issues around the requirement of huge invest-
ment toward creating more hospital beds and more physicians. Recently Sweden’s health 
minister announced that their country would eventually stop building any additional hos-
pital beds.

12.2.10  Bringing Delight to All
Healthcare is a service industry. Any good-quality service is defined by delivery in time, 
any time and consistency at all times. For a patient, a physician available over a call from 
his/her cell phone anytime is Comfort.

For a physician who can advise knowing the current status through simplified algo-
rithm is Confidence. The closed loop complete cycle of experience brings Trust to the patient. 
Consistently improving results bring Delight to all. Extensive studies have been conducted 
in Tertiary care hospitals of Chennai with FEVERWATCH® and will be soon published.
12.2.11  Need for Electronic Health Record 
Just paramedical workers and gadgets alone are not enough. They have to be supported 
by a health record which can capture what the paramedical workers do and the gadgets 
record. This calls for an EHR. Figure 12.6 shows a snapshot of olden days. It is not just 
enough to treat the patient with paper and pen.
12.3  Problems in Health Information System in the Country
	
1.	The cause of death statistics obtained from the civil registration system are often 
incomplete and of poor quality (Pandey et al. 2010).
	
2.	There is little coordination between the agencies managing health information 
and little integration and reconciliation of diverse data sources.
	
3.	Data gathering is incomplete, and the non-inclusion of the private sector excludes 
the major provider of health care in India.
	
4.	Although data collection on some indicators is duplicated, vast gaps exist on 
others. For example, information on health determinants, adult mortality and 
cause of death, adult morbidity, and the coverage and costs of many interventions 
are poorly recorded.
	
5.	Use of data is limited by an inadequate focus on outputs and outcomes when 
making decisions for allocation of funds and a shortage of skilled managers who 
can analyze and use the data for decision-making (Mishra et al. 2012).
FIGURE 12.6
Olden days approach: physician carrying all the information in his head: no longer acceptable or possible.

248
Internet of Things (IoT)
	
6.	Although no systematic data exist on the use and costs of medical technolo-
gies (e.g., cardiac stents and knee implants), their irrational use has been widely 
reported (Times of India).
	
7.	The single most important impediment to a holistic approach to health gover-
nance in the country is probably the inadequate convergence between various 
departments within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare that deals with 
medical education, health services, family welfare, and a multitude of vertically 
implemented national programs, and other ministries related to health, such as 
those that deal with water and sanitation.
	
8.	Additionally, Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees and Patient 
Welfare Committees have been formed in public health facilities to instill citi-
zen accountability of the health system; however, their overall effect is limited 
by a range of challenges related to selection procedures in place to ensure proper 
representation of marginalized populations and difficulties in effecting transfer 
and use of funds (Ganesh et al. 2013).
If the above deficiencies are corrected with a proper electronic record, vast improve-
ments can be made. That should be possible, if the components of hospital visits are enu-
merated and the health record is designed according to that need.
12.3.1  Registration
The first step is registration of the patient. It has name of the patient, parent’s name, 
address, telephone number, etc. for the first visit. For the subsequent visits, the appoint-
ment time and the token number is allotted to the patient. If the same is done using pen 
and paper, it is not going to be analyzed. As shown in Figure 12.7, this prevents the delay 
in developing EHRs.
12.3.2  Waiting Hall (see Figure 12.8)
Maximum amount of time is wasted when people are forced to wait. As sickness situa-
tions are emotionally charged, they cannot focus their minds on anything else and the 
FIGURE 12.7
Paper entry of registration is not only labor intensive, but also prevents the development of portable electronic 
health record.
www.ebook3000.com

249
Non-Physician Primary Healthcare Workers
time is wasted. Paramedics enter those doubts and problems of patients into a system. 
As they enter the problems, they can tell whether the symptoms are mild, moderate, or 
severe.
For example in the neonatal period, the following issues do not require oral medications.
	
1.	Noisy breathing
	
2.	Straining
	
3.	Cry before passing urine and motion
	
4.	Motion: one per feed or once a week
	
5.	Curd-like vomiting
	
6.	Watering of eyes
	
7.	Mild wetness around umbilicus
	
8.	Several skin problems
	
9.	Milk secretions from breast
	 10.	Bleeding from the vagina
As these are entered into the system, the paramedical worker answers the parents that 
these are normal.
The same time is used to explain simple things like not blow the nose or apply oil in the 
nose while feeding. This act, still rampant in 2016, causes pneumonia.
As Box 12.2 and Figure 12.9 shows, such a comprehensive consultation can be an over-
load for the young mother.
The physician’s consultation leads the patient to either pharmacy or if the illness 
demands to the laboratory.
12.3.3  Pharmacy
Each medical consultation ends up in physician writing a prescription, and each drug has 
at least 8 parameters to be addressed. 1. Formulation: Tablet or liquid. 2. Generic name.

BOX 12.2  CAPTURING THE PHYSICIAN’S 
CONSULTATION FAITHFULLY INTO THE EHR
Components of a Consultation
Rationale
Complaints
The problem for which child has been brought today. Child may have several 
problems, but parents bring to the hospital for the problem which is 
distressing to them. For example, child may not be eating well, but would 
have been brought to the hospital particularly on that day for diarrhea.
History of present illness
Details of the presenting problem. For example for diarrhea, frequency, 
fluidity, and volume of the motion. Was there fever? Blood? 
Past history
In case of diarrhea, the history of a similar problem in the past would 
indicate either unfavorable environment or a susceptible body 
constitution, both of which require evaluation.
Family history
Family history of wheeze, fits, and diabetes has an important bearing in 
treating the child. At present if there are any communicable problems in 
the family, like virus, fever is important to elicit.
Antenatal history
Hypertension, diabetes, and low thyroid problems can create havoc in the 
newborn period. When the child grows they can act as impediments.
Birth history
Type of delivery indicates the amount of suffering the child might have 
had; Usually prolonged labor results in operative deliveries.
Neonatal history
Seeds of problems like mental retardation are sown in the neonatal period. 
Many disorders have their beginning in the neonatal period.
Developmental history
Human brain grows only in the first 3 years and if mental delay is not 
picked up then there is high chance of the child becoming disabled. This is 
the status of several children.
Nutritional history
Food intake is an important component in the development of a child, 
which has both direct and indirect bearing on health.
Immunization history
Important in preventing many communicable illness.
Social and economic history
Economic and social circumstances make a child sick.
Other relevant issues
1. Separated parents. 2. Transport facilities not available for reaching the 
health center.

3. Trade name. 4. Strength: each 5 ml contains     mg or each tablet contains     mg. 5. Dose. 
6. Frequency: How many times in a day or once in     hours in a day. 7. Duration: How long 
the physician has to be taken. 8. Relationship to food: before or after food. This process is 
to be repeated for every drug and if a patient receives 4 drugs means then there will be 
32 data entries. Suppose a physician sees 50 patients in a day means then 1600 data entries 
for pharmacy alone. Needless to say errors do occur, and this can be solved only through 
electronic records and by paramedical workers.
12.3.4  Laboratory
This includes blood tests like blood counts, malaria, typhoid detection, and biochemi-
cal tests.
Imaging services: like X-rays and scans. If sound clinical principles are applied, they 
may not be required. EHR can display these results in a meaningful way.
Non-physician therapy, which includes other treatment modalities including counseling.
Follow-up: The entire process has to be repeated for the second visit.
Because the healthcare visits involve so many components, the cost of health care is high. 
We need a good electronic record to capture the same.
The EHR was designed and developed jointly by AA Child Care Center in Vellore and HELYXON® 
Health Solutions of IIT-M Research Park, Chennai.
12.4  Problems with Traditional EHR Software
HELYXON® software has been designed so that the paramedics can enter most of the data. 
Physician’s typing is less. This can be done before the patient is seen by the physician. 
As Figure 12.10 shows the waiting period is meaningfully utilized, using the software 
(Box 12.3).
FIGURE 12.10

Internet of Things (IoT)
12.4.1  INDIVO Open Source EHR
INDIVO is the original personal health platform, enabling an individual to own and man-
age a complete, secure digital copy of his/her health and wellness information. INDIVO 
integrates health information across sites of care and over time. INDIVO is free and open-
source uses open, unencumbered standards, including those from the SMART Platforms 
project and is actively deployed in diverse settings.
12.4.2  HELYXON®’s Vision for an EHR Targeted to Physicians of Indian Market
HELYXON® vision was to build an EHR system based on open standards and to empower 
the patient to control their data. The EHR should be built on loosely coupled building 
blocks which can be easily replaced. Physicians should also be able to easily customize 
the system to their needs. Multiple channels of access like mobile, tablets, etc. should be 
provided for parents and clinical support staff use.
12.4.2.1  Technical Approach
INDIVO was originally developed on Python 2.7 and Django 1.4. INDIVO provided 
Representational State Transfer—Application Programming Interface (REST API) 
which could be used by web, mobile apps, and other systems to interact with. INDIVO 
OAuth 1.0a provided the authentication system which could be used by other systems and 
end users. The INDIVO REST API provided facilities for user account creation and man-
agement, records management, storing medical facts, generating reports based on medical 
data, data management and sharing from patient login, care nets, and messaging.
Though INDIVO provided the basic API for common use cases for patients using EHR, 
the clinical management features and physician’s services and functionality were missing. 
INDIVO was originally designed to be extensible and other apps could be easily built 
leveraging INDIVO REST API.
12.4.2.2  Following Events Handled by HELYXON® EHR System
The users of this system (Box 12.4) are parents, paramedical workers, and physicians.
Parents: When a child falls sick, even when they do not come to the hospitals, parents 
record the child’s symptoms, in their smart phones using this software. This is called 
BOX 12.3  THE DRAWBACKS OF TRADITIONAL EHR 
SOFTWARE THAT PREVENTS THE EFFECTIVE USAGE
	
1.	Patients are not allowed to control who can see, use, or disclose sensitive 
health data.
	
2.	Lack of inter-operability with other EHR software and medical systems.
	
3.	Hard to use by physicians.
	
4.	Limited interaction with patients.
	
5.	It is not patient-friendly.
	
6.	Based on outdated technology and standards.

life log and Figure 12.11 shows it further. Examples include recording of cold cough, fever, 
vomiting, etc. whenever they occur.
As depicted in Figure 12.12, during the next visit, the previous occurrences of illness 
recorded to the system through mobile will be discussed by the physician.
The second component is handled by the paramedical worker. When the child comes to 
the hospital, the complaints are further discussed in detail and recorded to the system, as 
shown in Figure 12.13.
This can save tremendous time for the physician. For example, we can consider a very 
common problem diarrhea. World Health Organization classifies diarrhea into three 
groups: Those requiring admission to hospitals—children who have not passed urine in 
the last 8 hours or sick looking children; children requiring antibiotics and children who 
need only oral rehydration solution. It will take latest 2 minutes to gather all the informa-
tion and to take a decision. So for 50 patients in a day, it would mean 100 minutes. This 
can be easily done by the paramedical worker. The software discussed here helps them 
to do so. Moreover, even if data are entered wrongly by the worker, this can be always 
be corrected by the physician. This portion of the data can be stored in both the hospital 
computer and parent mobile.
After the basic complaints are entered, the growth of the child is recorded. One distin-
guishing feature of children is their growth. Weight recording tells about the immediate 
past events of the child (Figure 12.14).
For example if a child had weighed 9 kg last month and now it is 8 kg, then the cause 
should be found out.
Head circumference measurement is a quick guide to the brain development of the 
child. Any child delay in brain development has to be picked up in the first year of life. 
BOX 12.4  SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE HELYXON® EHR SYSTEM
	
1.	Migrated to the latest Python 3.4 and Django 1.8.
	
2.	Added support for use by multiple physicians.
	
3.	Enhanced account management and registration API to support registration 
of children and access of child data by parents.
	
4.	Improved messaging by adding support for email and SMS integration. 
Developed scheduled jobs which will automatically message parents for 
appointment, vaccination reminders, inform parents of any communication 
from physicians, etc.
	
5.	Developed an appointment system which supports both slot and token-
based booking.
	
6.	Developed a vaccination system for managing child vaccination as per IAP, 
reminders to parents, advisory information for parents, etc.
	
7.	From the physician’s perspective, inventory management for stocking vac-
cination, automated order processing for vaccines with the vendors/pharma-
cist chosen by physician, forecast to the physician for managing vaccination 
inventory.
	
8.	Growth charts for track and monitor child growth as per Indian Academy of 
Pediatrics (IAP) standards.

254
Internet of Things (IoT)
The easiest way, which can be done by anybody, is to check the head circumference and 
these are shown in Figure 12.15; it just takes less than a minute for a trained paramedical 
worker to do these.
The height measurements and its plotting in a graph can predict endocrine problems, 
constitutional growth delay, and stunting (Figure 12.16). This will lead the physician to 
take appropriate action.

Growth monitoring, no wonder, has been used as a tool for child survival (Figure 12.17).
The greatest advantage here is the paramedic can do it and parents also can do it at home.
As the data travel along with the parents, whenever the child is taken to a new center, 
they are visible in the second place instantly. These graphs are automatically generated once 
the data are entered by the paramedic. This eases the physician task and helps him to take quick 
decisions.
Children become adolescents and then adults, and pediatrician will be replaced by the 
adult physician. What has been happening over the years can be brought to the screen 
instantly. The type of illness child has been undergoing, if displayed chronologically, can 
help in planning appropriate preventive measures as in the case of asthma.
Other advantages of using the EHRs:
	
1.	Facility to handle multiple child profiles
	
2.	Manage child vaccination: Vaccine reminders are automatically sent

3.	Messaging management: for example by eight months a child should sit on its 
own. If there is a delay the physician should be consulted.
	
4.	Control access and sharing information with other physicians
	
5.	Schedule appointment with physicians
	
6.	Chat with physician online
	
7.	View advisory content from physician: For obesity, asthma, epilepsy, etc.
12.4.3  Role of Paramedical Workers in Various Health Programs
	
1.	Paramedics can effectively take the burden from physicians has been proved in 
many studies. Even in the litigation-prone country like USA, non-physicians like 
registered nurses are allowed to practice (Clayton 2009).
	
2.	Psychological interventions delivered by non-specialist health workers are effec-
tive for the treatment of prenatal depression in low- and middle-income countries 
(Chowdhary et al. 2014).
	
3.	Structured and practical teaching and learning with minimal theory in resource-
limited setting had a positive, short-term effect on the competence of individual 
staff to carry out an initial assessment and manage an acutely unwell patient 
(Stanley et al. 2015).
	
4.	Home visits by community health workers to improve identification of serious 
illness and care seeking in newborns and young infants from low- and middle-
income countries (Tripathy 2016).
FIGURE 12.17

5.	There is a unique referral model in private eye care institutions linking primary- 
to tertiary-level eye care, at LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad (Rao et al. 2012).
	
6.	In a Tanzanian study just four neurosurgeons could train paramedics in surgical 
procedures (Ellegala et al. 2014).
	
7.	A descriptive study was performed to collect information on the feasibility of sub-
stituting hospital care with primary care. This study concluded that it is possible 
to substitute hospital care with primary care and one important tool required is 
integrated information technology system (Van Hoof et al. 2016).
12.5  EHRs: Challenges and Solution to the Challenges
There exist barriers to adoption of e-health. Not all parents or physicians or paramedical 
workers accept the EHR. Following are some of the challenges faced during transition 
from conventional methods to electronic health care.
	
1.	Time: Most of the physicians do not take sufficient time to become successful in 
EHR (Loomis et al. 2002).
	
2.	Cost: For small- to medium-sized practices without large IT budgets, costs remain 
the biggest barrier to adoption (Rao et al. 2011).
	
3.	Absence of computer skill: Lack of coordination between patient care and data entry 
by most users (Loomis et al. 2002).
	
4.	Concern about security and privacy: Despite evidence to the contrary, non-users 
believe that there are more security and confidentiality risks involved with EHRs 
than paper records. Figures 12.18 and 12.19 convey these concerns in a lighter vein.
	
5.	Communication among users: Positive EHR experience has to be shared, and social 
networks are very useful (Castillo et al. 2010).
	
6.	Interferes with physician–patient relationship: Figure 12.20 captures this concern.
	
7.	Some physicians reported that they sometimes stop using EHRs because hunting 
for menus and buttons disrupts the clinical encounter (Loomis et al. 2002).
	
8.	Lack of incentives: This barrier could be easily corrected through financial rewards 
and appreciation for quality improvement (Meinert 2004).
	
9.	Complexity: Physicians should spend sufficient time initially to understand the 
complex world of EHRs (ibid).
	 10.	Physical space barriers: Space shortage, as the computers and accessories may take 
away large spaces (Ford et al. 2006).
	 11.	Concern about the ability to select an effective EHR system. Physicians wonder 
if the software will suit their style of practice (Miller and Sim 2004).
	 12.	Technical support: Particularly during off hours, holidays are a concern for many 
physicians (Ford et al. 2006).
	 13.	Interoperability as a determinant factor for adopting these systems: Interoperability 
is important because it decreases the cost of EHRs and makes it feasible for an

­individual or small group of physicians to acquire and adopt these systems 
(Castillo et al. 2010).
	 14.	Access to computers and computer literacy: The low level of electronic medical records 
system use could be explained by a lack of available computers (Ross 2009).
	 15.	Vendor trust: Physicians are concerned that vendors are not qualified to pro-
vide a proper service, or will go out of business and disappear from the market, 
leading to a lack of technical support and a large financial loss (Boonstra and 
Broekhuis 2010).
	 16.	Expert support: Expert support refers to the assistance provided from a physician to 
another physician. This can be divided in two aspects: (1) a physician with expe-
rience in EHRs usage assists with information about how to use the system to 
another physician; (2) a physician has the knowledge to help another physician 
accomplish a medical task. Such assistance can be given through personal contact 
or via documents (Castillo et al. 2010).
	 17.	Concern about data entry: Family physicians are sought after for their counseling 
abilities. Time taken to make data entry is the largest potential obstacle to the 
effective use of computers in family medicine (ibid).
	 18.	Reliability: Reliability refers to the dependability of the technology systems that 
comprise the EHR. As more vendors enter the lucrative healthcare market, the 
number of competing systems will increase. Vendors will seek to differentiate 
themselves from competitors using quality and reliability of their EHR systems as 
evidence of their superiority (Rao et al. 2011).
	 19.	Inadequate data exchange: Data are generated from physicians, pharmacy, lab, radi-
ology, and referral to other hospitals. From patient point of view, policies should 
hasten the creation of community-wide data exchange systems that allow clini-
cians to view all of their patients’ data, regardless of provider and care site (Meinert 
2004).
	 20.	Concern about patient acceptance: Physicians would spend more time interacting 
with the computer than the patient (Ajami et al. 2011). This need not be so always. 
With experience it will disappear.
	 21.	Formal training: Physician style of learning and his/her clinical needs have to be 
taken into account in training (Ford et al. 2006).

12.5.1  Problems Faced with Wearable Devices in Health Care
At present, FEVERWATCH®, which is available in the market, measures only temperature. 
In an inpatient setting this may not be sufficient. The same sensor should be able to trans-
mit blood pressure and respiratory rate, so that the paramedical worker can make intel-
ligent decisions and help the physicians.
There are other issues to be supervised.
•	 Legal requirements: As this is a new field, legal requirements is not fully known 
to use in a hospital setting. However, pilot studies are going on in tertiary care 
centers in Chennai.
•	 Cost: Like all gadgets the initial cost will be high and it will come down only when 
the volume increases.
12.6  Best Practices for Usage of EHRs
We must remember the following points while moving toward EHR usage
	
1.	Use open standards for architectural design and implementation to develop an 
EHR system. When developed using building blocks, it can be easily replaced 
with other plug-ins.
	
2.	Develop user-friendly mobile and tablet apps to improve patient usage and inter-
action with the system.
	
3.	Provide real-time and static-messaging facilities to make the patient constantly in 
touch with the physicians.
	
4.	Provide reminders and notifications to parents on trigger of some health condi-
tion, which deserves attention, like asthma.
	
5.	Life log facility to enable parent to store observations by parents and subsequent 
review by parents.
	
6.	Care net feature which enables sharing data with near and dear ones.
12.7  Conclusions and Future Works
Despite the positive effects from using EHRs in medical practices, the adoption rate of 
such systems is still low, and they meet resistance from physicians. EHR usage requires 
the presence of trained users, system facilities, support from others, and numerous 
organizational and environment facilitators. In addition, difficulty of using EHRs and 
the non-use of specific functions is due to the presence of above-mentioned barriers. For 
the EHR systems to have a positive impact on patient safety, clinicians must be able to 
use these systems effectively with the provided system features. It has been shown that 
implementers can insulate the project from concerns by establishing strong leadership, 
using project management techniques, establishing standards and training their staff

to ensure the reliability and superiority of implementation. Paramedics can be trained 
at medical college level itself for usage, maintenance, and upgradation of such as system 
with ease.
Continuous monitoring of critical parameters along with right information is going to 
reduce the anxiety of the patients. Car panel digital display of number of kilometers left 
before the next gas station, laptop displaying the remaining MB of data in downloads 
time, and cell phone showing the remaining battery charges in % are possible due to 
continuous monitoring. These kinds of warnings reduce the anxiety of the users. Why 
can’t they be adapted in healthcare? People need to know their health status in a way 
they can understand and relate. The continuously monitored health data can be inter-
preted by the system in the same way for the physician to alert the patients before they 
could end up with a major health risk. To enable this, tie-up between the certified physi-
cians within the vicinity, patients, and IoT service providers is essential to bring person-
alized health monitoring and to start first aid treatment on emergencies even before the 
ambulance arrives.
Awareness brings the higher quality need. It becomes easy to convince the patient on 
early actions required like vaccination and other precautionary medications. We need to 
exploit the technological capability to develop a well-informed patient and the physician 
through different communication media such as email, SMS, message chat, voice chat, 
and phone calls. Patients can be encouraged to start noting all the symptoms in the right 
sequence, so that the exaggerations or miss-communication by patient to physician can be 
avoided completely. We are heading toward that day when physician is able to provide best 
possible personalized care, which can provide from symptomatic remedy, to cause-based 
solution and prevention. Prognostication becomes a science instead of educated guess. 
Above all, these situations can be handled by a trained paramedical worker, provided suit-
able EHR and wearable computational devices are available.

13.1  Introduction
Semantic web technologies are becoming very popular and are adopted by companies 
such as Google and Yahoo. Websites use Schema.org to enhance the research results. 
Schema.org is a set of vocabularies called ontologies (Gruber 1995) to describe data on the 
web in an unified way such as Person and Organization. Google introduces the idea of the 
knowledge graph to structure and connect data with each other. Moreover, “Linked data” 
is very popular to share and reuse data to build and enhance rich web applications with

little effort. The major challenge for the IoT would be to help developers in designing and 
developing interoperable inter-domain IoT applications. As devices are not interoperable 
with each other due to their proprietary formats, they do not use vocabulary to describe 
interoperable IoT data. One way to make them interoperable would be a common protocol 
used by all devices. Another solution would be to work on the interoperability of this data, 
since these devices are already deployed and data are already produced. Exploiting, com-
bining, and enriching device data to build smarter interoperable applications is becoming 
a real challenge. The growing linked open data encourages to share the data on the web, 
including sensor data. To assist users or even machines in interpreting and combining the 
sensor data, there is a real need to explicitly describe sensor measurements according to 
the context, in a unified way and in a manner understandable by machines. For instance, 
temperature measurement does not mean the same always and its meaning varies accord-
ing to the context (room temperature, body temperature, water temperature, or external 
temperature) and the machine will not infer the same knowledge (fever deduced with 
body temperature, abnormal temperature for room temperature). We also need to deal 
with implicit units (e.g., Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin).
The second biggest challenge is combining domain-specific applications and data together 
to create innovative cross-domain IoT applications. Existing applications are specific to one 
domain such as smart home, smart health care, transportation, and smart ­garden. Examples 
of innovative cross-domain IoT applications: (1) suggesting food according to the weather 
forecast, (2) suggesting home remedies according to health measurements, and (3) suggest-
ing safety equipment in a smart car according to the weather, etc. Future smart fridges will 
enable to purchase groceries online. In case of RFID tags embedded in food, it will be easy 
to recommend the menu for dinner or automatically order essential ingredients. If you are 
an athlete, the smart fridge will recommend you the perfect diet in case of compatibility 
with Apple Nike shoes. Finally, Google’s car could automatically take you to the grocery 
store to grab the missing ingredients. Last but not the least, security issues should be con-
sidered when combining IoT data or designing IoT applications. For instance, health data 
are more sensitive than weather data and need to be secured.
Further, according to Barnaghi et al. (2012), semantics is required at different  ­levels in IoT; 
it can be used to: (1) describe things and data, (2) reuse domain knowledge, (3) ­interpret IoT 
data, (4) provide smarter applications, and (5) provide security (Figure 13.1).
The existing challenges for the semantics-enabled IoT can be summarized as follows:
Generating interoperable cross-domain semantic-based IoT applications. This process 
should be flexible enough to be performed either on the cloud, constrained devices, or 
machine-to-machine (M2M) gateways. M2M gateways mean that processing is done auto-
matically, without requiring human intervention.
Interpreting sensor data and inferring new knowledge by reusing domain knowledge 
expertise. Reusing domain knowledge (e.g., ontology) is highly recommended (Simperl 
2009; Suárez-Figueroa 2010). The interoperability of domain knowledge enables building 
of cross-domain expertise.
Securing IoT applications when designing these applications. This challenge should be 
solved using the same approach as for the two previous challenges by combining security 
knowledge expertise to find the most suitable security mechanisms to secure IoT applications.
To deal with the challenges, we exploit semantic web technologies (Berners-Lee et al. 
2001) for several reasons. First, semantics enables an explicit description of the meaning of 
sensor data in a structured way, so that machines could understand it. Second, it facilitates 
interoperability for data integration since heterogeneous IoT data is converted according to 
the same vocabulary. Third, semantic reasoning engines can be easily employed to deduce

high-level abstractions from sensor data. Fourth, context-awareness could be implemented 
using semantic reasoning. Finally, in theory, semantics eases the knowledge sharing and 
reuse of domain knowledge expertise which should avoid the reinvention of the wheel. 
Indeed, each time a new domain-specific vocabulary is defined.
13.2  Semantic Technology
13.2.1  Resource Description Framework
The resource description framework (RDF) (Klyne and Carroll 2004) is a framework for 
graph-based information representation about resources and was intended for represent-
ing metadata about WWW resources. RDF gives interoperability between various applica-
tions that exchange information, which can be inferred by machine on the web. Various 
uses of RDF are given below:
•	 Providing standards for exchanging data between databases.
•	 By connecting RDF descriptions of people across multiple websites, distributed 
social networks can be built.
•	 Cross-dataset can be executed with the help of Simple Protocol and RDF Query 
Language (SPARQL) query if the datasets are interconnected in an organization.
13.2.1.1  RDF Data Model
An RDF is a graph-based data model, and subject–predicate–object expression is its basic 
structure. We can make a statement about resources using RDF. Each resource is associ-
ated with universal resource identifier (URI). An URI is structured like an URL (Uniform 
Resource Locator) or some other type of identifier. Special kinds of resource called

Internet of Things (IoT)
­properties or predicates describe relations between resources. For example: “hasLoca-
tion,” “hasType,” “hasID,” “deviceID.” The relationship from subject to object is expressed 
in a directional way. Properties in RDF are also identified by URIs. Say, for example, 
“­hasLocation” can be defined as: http://www.loanr.it/ontologies#hasLocation. RDF state-
ments are called triples because they consist of three elements. An RDF statement has the 
following syntax:
  <subject> <predicate> <object>
Example:
  <“Sensor”, Of_Type, “Temperature”>
IRIs, literals, and blank nodes are three different types of nodes in an RDF graph. 
The positional constraints in the RDF are as follows: Predicate must be an URI; subject 
must be an URI or blank node; and object must be a URI, blank node, or literal. An RDF 
graph is a set of RDF triples. It can be visualized as a directed labeled graph. Each triple 
in an RDF graph is represented as a node-arc-node connectivity. Figure 13.2 shows the 
­structure of RDF graph and Figure 13.3 shows the example of an RDF graph.
13.2.1.2  Internationalized Resource Identifier
An IRI is an Internet standard extended upon the existing URI, and it was published in 
RFC 3987 standard (Horrocks et al. 2004). The RDF resources are identified by IRI, which 
can appear in the subject, predicate, and object positions of a triple. IRI is in the URL form.
13.2.1.3  Literals
Literals are fixed values. Some examples of literals include strings, dates, and num-
bers. Literals are related with a data type which allows values to be parsed and

interpreted appropriately. It may appear only in the object position but not in the subject 
or the predicate positions in the RDF triple. Generally, literals with string data type can be 
related with a language tag. Consider the following example: “dimanche” can be related 
with the “fr” language tag and “Sunday” with the “en” language tag.
13.2.1.4  Blank Nodes
When we talk about resources without the consideration of the use of the global identifier, 
the blank nodes come into picture. Blank nodes are used to denote resources and its nam-
ing can be given without an IRI. In an RDF triple, these blank nodes may be used in the 
subject and object positions.
13.2.1.5  Multiple RDF Graphs
Sometimes, it is advantageous to work with multiple RDF graphs combined easily with the 
data from multiple sources. An RDF dataset is a collection of RDF graphs with zero or more 
named graphs. In an RDF dataset, the named graphs are the RDF graphs that are associated 
with IRI or blank node. The blank node or IRI is called the graph name. The other graph 
which is remaining in the RDF dataset without a related IRI is called the default graph.
13.2.1.6  RDF Vocabulary
An RDF vocabulary is a pre-defined set of predicates that can be used in an application. 
List of RDF vocabulary is given in Table 13.1.
13.2.1.7  Writing RDF Graphs
For writing RDF graphs, different serialization formats are available such as Turtle, 
N-Triple, RDF/JSON, RDF/XML, and N3 or Notation3. Nevertheless, using the different 
formats for writing down the same graph leads to logically equivalent triples.
(a) Turtle
A Turtle serialization format is a textual representation. Single-line comments can be 
given after a “#” which is not part of the lexical token. Simple triple statement is a chain 
of subject part, predicate part, and object part, each of which can separated by space and 
ends with by “.”

Often the same subject part in an RDF triple will be related with more than one predi-
cate and object in RDF triple. Hence, when the predicate and the object vary for the same 
subject of triples, a “;” can be used to repeat the subject. The following two examples are 
logically equivalent:

When the object varies with the same subject and predicate, a “,” can be used to repeat the 
subject part and predicate part of the triple. The following examples are logically equiva-
lent ways of writing the unit measurement in two different languages.

(b) N-Triples
N-Triples are a sequence of RDF terms representing the subject, predicate, and object. Each 
RDF term in the sequence of N-Triples may be separated by space. This sequence ends by a 
“.”, and it is optional to the last triple in the document. It is a subset of Turtle and Notation 3.

(c) RDF/JSON
RDF/JSON serialization format represents a set of RDF triples as a series of nested data 
structures.
A single JSON object in an RDF/JSON document is called the root object. Subject of the 
RDF triple will be key in the root object. Key may appear only once in the root object. Each 
root object’s key value is a JSON object, whose keys are the URIs of the properties associ-
ated with each subject in a triple. These keys are called predicate keys. The predicate keys

271
Semantic Technologies for IoT
may present only once in a JSON object and the value of each predicate key is an array of 
JSON objects.
An RDF triple can be written in the following way:
{ "Subject" : { "Predicate" : [ Object ] } }
In a triple, the object is represented as a JSON object as follows:
type (mandatory and must be lower case)
  'uri' or 'literal' or 'bnode'
value (mandatory and full URI should be used)
  its lexical value
datatype (optional)
  the data type of the literal value
lang (optional)
  language of a literal value
Example :
{
  “ https://w3id.org/saref#Switch" : {
  “ https://w3id.org/saref#hasName" : [ { “value” : ” “Light switch”,
                                             “type” : “literal”,
                                             “lang” : “en” } ]
}
}
(d) N3 or Notation3
In N3 notation, the subject, predicate, and object of an RDF triple are separated by spaces 
and each triple is terminated with a period (.). The syntax of N3 would be:
@prefix saref: <https://w3id.org/saref#>.
saref:EnergyMeter saref:IsUsedForr     saref:Energy;
                  sasaref:consistsOf    saref:Meter.
(e) RDF/\XML
RDF/XML is an XML syntax for RDF in terms of namespaces in XML. With the help of 
XML syntax, RDF information can easily be exchanged between computers independent 
of operating systems and application languages. RDF/XML is a syntax defined by the W3C 
to serialize an RDF graph as an XML document.
<rdf:RDF> is the root element of an RDF document. It defines the XML document to be 
an RDF document. It also contains a reference to the RDF namespace as follows:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF
          xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
          .............
</rdf:RDF>
The <rdf:Description> element contains the description of the resource identified by the 
rdf:about attribute.

272
Internet of Things (IoT)
The property elements can also be defined as attributes:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF
        xmlns:cd=" http:/sensormeasurement.appspot.com/m3#"
        xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
<rdf:Description
       rdf:about="http:/sensormeasurement.appspot.com/m3#Measurement"
       cd:name=" Temperature " cd:unit="DegreeCelsius" cd:value="35"/>
</rdf:RDF>
The property elements can also be defined as resources:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF
         xmlns:cd=" http:/sensormeasurement.appspot.com/m3#"
         xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
<rdf:Description
   rdf:about="http:/sensormeasurement.appspot.com/m3#Measurement">
<cd:name rdf:resource="http:/sensormeasurement.appspot.com/m3#Temperature"/>
  ...
  ...
</rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
RDF/XML allows use of the xml:lang attribute to identify the content language. 
This ­attribute can be used in any resource to indicate that the content given in the tag is in 
the specific language. The xml:lang="" indicates that there is no language specified.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rdf:RDF    xmlns:saref=" https://w3id.org/saref#"
                     xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="saref:Measurement">

        <saref:hasUnit xml:lang="ru"> метр </saref:hasUnit>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
In an RDF, typed literals can be used as an object node. It consists of a string and a data-
type IRI. These are written in RDF/XML using an attribute rdf:datatype=”datatypeURI” 
within the property element.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF    xmlns:saref=” https://w3id.org/saref#”
                     xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">

Instead of rdf:about, the rdf:ID attribute on a node element can be used, and it gives a rela-
tive IRI which is equivalent to “#” symbol concatenated with attribute rdf:ID. The below 
example shows abbreviating the node IRI of https://w3id.org/saref#TemparatureUnit using 
an xml:base of http://example.org/case/ and an rdf:ID on the rdf:Description node element.

RDF has container membership properties called rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc., and these property 
elements are used with instances of the rdf:Alt, rdf:Seq, and rdf:Bag classes as shown in 
the following example. The rdf:li is a special property element, and it can be used instead 
of rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc.,
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF    xmlns om::”http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/om-1.8/”
                    xmlns: saref=”https://w3id.org/saref#”

  <rdf:Seq rdf:about=" https://w3id.org/saref#TemperatureUnit ">
    <rdf:_1 rdf:resource="om:degree_Celsius"/>
    <rdf:_2 rdf:resource="om:degree_Fahrenheit"/>
    <rdf:_3 rdf:resource="om:kelvin"/>
  </rdf:Seq>
</rdf:RDF>
RDF/XML allows an rdf:parseType=“Collection” attribute on a property element which 
contains multiple node elements. A set of subject nodes of the collection can be given using 
these nodes. A collection of subject nodes can be represented as given below:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF    xmlns: sare=”https://w3id.org/saref#”
                    xmlns om::”http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/om-1.8/”
                    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="https://w3id.org/saref#TemperatureUnit">
    <sare:hasUnit rdf:parseType="Collection">
       <rdf:Description rdf:about="om:degree_Celsius”/>
       <rdf:Description rdf:about="om:degree_Fahrenheit"/>

13.2.2  RDF Schema
RDF Schema is a semantic extension of RDF. RDF Schema is abbreviated in different ways 
as RDFS, RDF(S), RDF-S, or RDF/S. RDFS provides a data-modeling vocabulary for RDF 
data. It provides a way for describing groups of resources and the relationships between 
these resources. These resources can be used to determine characteristics of other resources 
such as the domains and ranges of properties.
RDFS uses the class to identify groups, and it can be used to group the resources. 
The ­relationship between an individual and its class is represented by using property. 
RDFS is used to create class hierarchies and of properties and (Table 13.2). Domain and 
range restrictions can be used to provide restrictions on the subjects and objects of RDF 
triples. For example, subject of “hasUnit” triples should be of class “Measurement” and 
object should be “MeasurementUnit”. Tables 13.3 and 13.4 provide an overview of the 
RDFS vocabulary.

RDF vocabularies used worldwide are given below:
“Friend of a Friend” (FOAF) (Brickley and Miller 2004) vocabulary is used to repre-
sent the relations between entities in social networks.
Dublin Core is used to represent the relations between video, image, and other web 
resources.
schema.org is used to describe event, health, and medical types, Organization, 
Person, Place, LocalBusiness, Restaurant, etc.
13.2.3  Web Ontology Language
Web Ontology Language (OWL) (Patel-Schneider et al. 2012) is a set of mark-up languages 
that are designed for use by applications to process the content of information instead 
of just presenting information to humans. The OWL ontology describes the hierarchical 
­organization of ideas in a domain, in a way that can be parsed and understood by soft-
ware. OWL has more facilities for expressing meaning and semantics than XML, RDF, 
and RDFS, and thus OWL goes beyond these languages in its ability to represent machine 
interpretable content on the web. OWL is part of the W3C recommendations related to the 
semantic web. It is summarized as follows.
Ontologies are critical for applications that want to search across or merge information 
from diverse communities. Although XML DTDs and XML Schemas are sufficient for 
exchanging data between parties who have agreed to definitions beforehand, their lack of 
semantics prevent machines from reliably performing this task given new XML vocabular-
ies. The same term may be used with different meaning in different contexts, and different 
terms may be used for items that have the same meaning. RDF and RDF Schema begin to 
approach this problem by allowing simple semantics to be associated with identifiers. With 
RDF Schema, one can define classes that may have multiple subclasses and super classes, 
and can define properties, which may have subproperties, domains, and ranges. In this 
sense, RDF Schema is a simple ontology language. However, in order to achieve interopera-
tion between numerous, autonomously developed and managed schemas, richer semantics 
are needed. For example, RDF Schema cannot specify that the Person and Car classes are 
disjoint, or that a string quartet has exactly four musicians as members.
OWL adds additional vocabulary for describing properties and relations between classes 
and characteristics of properties as depicted in Figure 13.4.
13.2.3.1  OWL Language Basics
OWL offers three expressive sublanguages intended to be use by ontology developers.
•	 OWL LITE provides users a classification hierarchy and constraints specifications 
for classes and properties.
•	 OWL DL Provides users the most expressive vocabulary including computational 
completeness (all conclusions are certain to be computed) and decidability (all 
computations can end in finite time).
•	 OWL Full has most expressiveness and the syntactic freedom of RDF with no 
­computational guarantees. For example, in OWL Full a class will be treated at 
the same time as a collection of individuals and as an individual in its own right. 
OWL Full permits an ontology to boost the meaning of the pre-defined (RDF or 
OWL) vocabulary.

276
Internet of Things (IoT)
13.2.3.2  OWL Lite Features
In OWL Lite, as in RDF, we can outline classes and class/subclass hierarchies in any 
domain and properties of these classes using RDF constructs such as Class, rdfs:subClassOf, 
rdfs:Property, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, and rdfs:range. For defining the equality/
inequality relationships among the ontology components, the following constructs are 
there in OWL Lite:
•	 sameAs: One individual may be indicated to be the same as another individual.
•	 allDifferent: Many individuals may be identified to be mutually distinct in one 
allDifferent statement.
•	 differentFrom: An individual may be quantified to be different from other 
individuals.
•	 equivalentClass: One class is expected to be equivalent to another class.
•	 equivalentProperty: One property may be defined to be equivalent to another 
property.
In OWL Lite, the following distinctive identifiers offer an influential mechanism for better 
reasoning about a property to provide information regarding properties and their values:
•	 FunctionalProperty: Properties may be defined to have a single value. If a prop-
erty is a FunctionalProperty, then it can have no more than one value for each 
individual. For example, hasdeviceId may be stated to be a FunctionalProperty.

Semantic Technologies for IoT
From this, a reasoner may infer that no devices may have more than one deviceId 
in a sensor network. This does not imply that every device must have at least one 
device id in a network however.
•	 InverseFunctionalProperty: Properties may be inverse functional. If a property 
is inverse functional, then the inverse of the property is functional. Therefore, the 
inverse of the property will have at the most one value for every individual. As an 
example, hasdeviceId (a distinctive identifier for the device in a network) is also 
expressed to be inverse functional (or unambiguous). The inverse of this property 
(which is also mentioned as isThedeviceIdFor) has at the most one value for any 
device (for a unique network). Therefore, any one device’s deviceID is the only 
value for its isThedeviceIdFor property. From this, a reasoner will deduce that no 
two totally different individual instances of device have the identical deviceId in 
an exceedingly unique network. Also, a reasoner will deduce that if two instances 
of device in a unique network have a similar deviceID, then those two instances 
confer with a similar device.
•	 SymmetricProperty: Properties may be identified to be symmetric. For exam-
ple, is_connectedto may be defined as a symmetric property. Then a reasoner 
can deduce that “Device_2” is_connectedto “Device_2” provided that “Device_1” 
is_connectedto “Device_2.”
•	 inverseOf: Two properties are identified to be inverse to each other. For example, if 
has_sensor is the inverse of has_network and “Network_A” has_sensor “Sensor_1,” 
then a reasoner can deduce that “Sensor_1” has_network “Network_A.”
•	 TransitiveProperty: Properties may be well defined to be transitive. For exam-
ple, if “part of” property is said to be transitive, and if Device_1 is a partOf 
SensorA (i.e., (Device_1, SensorA) is an instance of the property partOf and 
Device_2 is partOf Device_1 (i.e., (Device_2, Device_1) is an instance of the 
property partOf, then a reasoner can deduce that Device_2 is a part of SensorA. 
MaxCardinality 1 restriction is not allowed for transitive properties and their 
super properties.
	
	
OWL Lite lets restrictions on properties that may be utilized by instances of a 
class. The subsequent two restrictions limit the values that may be used, whereas 
the cardinality restrictions limit how many values may be used.
•	 someValuesFrom: The restriction someValuesFrom is declared on a property 
with regard to a class having a restriction that a minimum of one value for that 
­property is of a particular type.
•	 allValuesFrom: The restriction allValuesFrom declared on a property with 
regard to a class implies that the property incorporates a local range restriction 
related to it.
	
	
OWL Lite cardinality restrictions on properties allow having value zero or one. 
They do not permit random values for cardinality, as is the case in OWL dl and 
OWL Full. This permits the user to specify “at least one,” “no more than one,” and 
“exactly one.”
•	 minCardinality: This restriction requires that the property should have a value 
for all instances of the class. That is, if a minCardinality of one is given on a prop-
erty with regard to a class, then any instance of that class is correlative to a mini-
mum of one individual by that property.

278
Internet of Things (IoT)
•	 maxCardinality: A maxCardinality one restriction is termed a functional or 
­distinctive property. That is, if a maxCardinality of one is declared on a property 
with regard to a class, then any instance of that class will be associated with at the 
most one individual by that property.
In OWL, properties are characterized consistent with individuals, whether or not they 
relate to individuals (object properties) or to data-type properties. OWL uses most of the 
intrinsic XML Schema data types.
13.2.3.3  Incremental Language Description of OWL DL and OWL FULL
OWL FULL and OWL DL have the same vocabulary while OWL DL has some restric-
tions. Furthermore, OWL DL properties can be DatatypeProperties or ObjectProperties. 
ObjectProperties are relations between instances of two classes while DatatypeProperties 
are relations between instances of classes, RDF literals, and XML Schema data types. 
The OWL DL and OWL Full vocabulary that extends the constructions of OWL Lite are 
described below.
•	 oneOf: (enumerated classes): Classes can be designated by enumeration of a vari-
ety of individuals. The class members are exactly the set of enumerated individu-
als; no more, no less. For example, the class of Sensor_Type for a sensor network 
can be described by simply enumerating the individuals as UV sensors, touch 
sensors, humid sensors, pressure sensors, thermal sensors, etc.
•	 hasValue: Certain individual values can be associated for a property, also some­
times referred to as property values. For example, instances of the class of 
Chemical_sensors can be characterized as those sensors that have gas as a value 
of their chemical component. (The chemical component value, gas, is an instance 
of the class of chemical_components.)
•	 disjointWith: Classes can be disjoint. For instance, Analog_sensors and Digital_
sensors can be considered as disjoint classes. So a reasoner can infer an incon-
sistency when an individual is stated to be an instance of both and similarly a 
reasoner can reason out that if sensor_A is an instance of Analog_sensor, then A 
cannot be an instance of Digital_sensor.
•	 complementOf, unionOf, intersectionOf: OWL DL allows Boolean combina-
tions of classes and restrictions—complementOf, unionOf, and intersectionOf. 
For example, using complementOf, we could state that analog sensors are not digi-
tal sensors and using unionOf, we can state that a class contains sensors that are 
either Analog_sensors or Digital_sensors.
•	 minCardinality, maxCardinality, cardinality: FULL OWL allows cardinality 
statements for arbitrary positive integers, while in OWL Lite, cardinalities are 
­limited to at least, at most, or exactly 1 or 0.
13.3  Existing Standardizations in IoT Semantics
Semantic sensor networks work on the interoperability of physical sensor networks to ease 
the sensor discovery. Further, they focus on semantically annotating sensor information to 
www.ebook3000.com

279
Semantic Technologies for IoT
unleash it as “Linked Sensor Data.” Ontologies and alternative semantic technologies are 
often key enabling technologies for sensor networks, as they facilitate semantic interoper-
ability and integration, reasoning, classification, different kinds of assurance, and auto-
mation not addressed within the OGC standards. A Semantic Sensor Network has to be 
organized, installed and managed, queried, understood, and controlled through high-
level specifications. Further, when reasoning regarding sensors, complicated physical con-
straints like restricted power availability, restricted memory, variable information quality, 
and loose connectivity ought to be taken into consideration. Once these constraints are 
formally depicted in an ontology, reasoning techniques are more readily applied and uti-
lized. They enable classification and reasoning on the capabilities and measurements of 
sensors, the origin of measurements, and also the association of a variety of sensors as a 
macro instrument. Following W3C recommendation, OWL 2 dl is the designated language 
for ontology specification. There are excellent sensor ontologies, few of which are coupled 
with one another and are obtainable online. The sensor ontologies, to some extent, reflect 
the OGC standards and may encode sensor descriptions and mapping between the ontolo-
gies. Table 13.5 summarizes the details of various published IoT ontologies for adding 
semantics to sensor networks.
13.3.1  W3C SSN Ontology
The W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) ontology is a product of all of the aforemen-
tioned sensor ontologies. These ontologies mainly focus on the description of physical sen-
sor networks such as sensor capabilities, location of the sensor (latitude and longitude), etc.

Internet of Things (IoT)
They do not address the problem of describing sensor data in an interoperable manner to 
ease the reasoning task. The development of SSN ontology is based on the following works:
•	 The CESN ontology (Calder et al. 2010)
•	 The OntoSensor ontology, a prototype sensor knowledge repository (Russomanno 
et al. 2005a, 2005b; Goodwin and Russomanno 2006)
•	 A service-oriented ontology for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) (Kim et al. 2008)
•	 An ontology for sensor networks to describe the topology, network setting, sensor 
properties, dataflow, and sensor network performance (Jurdak et al. 2004)
•	 Other ontologies related to sensor networks (Avancha et al. 2004; Eid et al. 2006, 
2007)
The W3C Semantic Sensor Networks Incubator Group, the SSN-XG, developed the SSN 
ontology for defining sensors and the measurement capabilities of sensors, the obser-
vations that outcomes from sensing, and deployments in which sensors are used. The 
ontology is centered on concepts of systems, processes, and observations. It describes the 
physical and processing structure of sensors. The SSN ontology is a combination of all pre-
vailing sensor ontologies. It outlines the concepts for demonstrating sensors, their obser-
vation, and the surrounding settings. The ontology includes large parts of the SensorML 
and O&M standards from the OGC, omitting regulations as well as process explanations 
and data types, which were not considered sensor specific and if required can be incorpo-
rated from other ontologies. The SSN ontology is presently used in many research projects. 
Constant use of the SSN ontology by its development community and others will uncover 
design weaknesses or essential add-ons, and may boost the community to restructure for 
approved enrichments, either informally or as part of a development or even standards 
group. The illustration of a sensor in the ontology links together what it measures (the 
domain phenomena), the physical sensor (the device), and its functions and processing (the 
models) as depicted in Figure 13.5.
13.3.2  Ontology Structure
The Semantic Sensor Network ontology orbits around the central Stimulus-Sensor-
Observation pattern. Several theoretical modules enumerate the pattern to describe key 
sensor concepts. The relationships between them appear in Figure 13.6 which comprises a 
summary of the 10 main classes in the ontology modules.
The ontology can be used for a focus on any (or a combination) of a number of perspectives:
•	 A data or observation perception, with an emphasis on observations and related 
metadata
•	 A sensor perception, with an emphasis on what senses, how it senses, and what 
is sensed
•	 A system perception, with an emphasis on systems of sensors

The ontology excludes a hierarchy of sensor types; these definitions are left for domain 
experts to decide, based on the workings of the sensors.
SSN defines high-level concepts for representing sensors, their observation, and the 
­surrounding environment. However, according to the W3C SSN ontology final report, 
SSN has several limitations:
•	 Common terms to represent subclasses of ssn:Sensor type, measurement type, 
unit type, or domain type (ssn:FeatureOfInterest) are not made available in the 
ontology. This limitation hinders machine automation.
•	 Domain concepts like time and locations are not included in SSN. But via OWL 
imports, these concepts can be included from other ontologies. This may result in 
interoperability issues between domain ontologies, since domain ontologies that 
are related to IoT are not standardized.

In their final report, they have mentioned that they “do not provide a basis for reasoning 
that can ease the development of advanced applications.” This makes it evident that a com-
mon description of sensor measurements should be provided.
Future work is to “standardize the SSN ontology to use it in a Linked Sensor Data con-
text” and to “standardize the SSN ontology to bridge the Internet of Things.” These facts 
highlight the need to provide a common description of all related sensor measurements 
and other details.
13.3.3  IoT-Lite Ontology
Iot-Lite is a lightweight ontology based on SSN to describe IoT concepts and relationships. 
IoT-Lite is an instantiation of the SSN ontology. The lightweight allows the use of IoT 
platforms that can be extended in order to represent IoT concepts in a more detailed way 
in different domains that allows the discovery and interoperability of IoT resources in 
heterogeneous platforms using a common vocabulary. The ontology includes IoT concepts 
into three classes—objects, system or resources, and services. The devices are divided 
into three classes: sensing devices, tag devices, and actuating devices. The services are 
described with availability or access control and coverage. The coverage discusses about 
the area covered by the IoT device. To describe the units and QuantityKind that IoT 
devices can measure, well-known taxonomies qu and qudt are used. Figure 13.8 depicts 
the concepts of the ontology and the main relationships between them.
13.4  Semantic Web Rule Language
Rule languages are commonly used in most of the business applications. But, there is little 
interoperability between current rule-based systems. The main goal of the semantic web

is the interoperation. Developing a language for sharing rules is often seen as a key step 
in reaching this goal.
Expressing all relations using OWL 2 language is very difficult. For example, OWL 
cannot express the relation child of married parents, because there is no way in OWL 2 to 
express the relation between resources with which a resource has relations. By adding 
SWRL rules (Horrocks et al. 2004) to an ontology, the expressivity of OWL can be extended. 
SWRL rules are similar to rules in DATALOG or Prolog languages. SWRL allows users to 
write rules expressed in terms of OWL concepts to reason about OWL individuals. Using 
the rules, new knowledge can be inferred from existing knowledge bases. There are many 
built-ins which will provide an extension mechanism whereby the modeling language 
can be enhanced with domain-specific built-ins. The predicates can be class expressions, 
property expressions, data range restrictions, sameIndividual, differentIndividuals, core 
SWRL built-ins, and user-defined SWRL built-ins.
SWRL rules with class expressions
The following rule uses a class expression:
Observces(?sensor, health), produces(?sensor,?measurement) →
BodyTemperature(?measurement)
SWRL rules with data range restrictions
The following rule uses a data range restriction:
BodyTemperature(?measurement), hasValue (?measurement,?v), integer[> 36, < 38]( ?v) →
NormalBodyTemperature(?measurement)
The following rule uses the core built-ins:
Precipitation(?measurement),hasValue(?measurement,?v),hasUnit(?measurement, Milimet
erPerHour),swrlb:greaterThan(?v,20),swrlb:lessThan(?v,50) →
HeavyRain((?measurement)

13.5  Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language
SPARQL (Prud’Hommeaux and Seaborne 2008) is a standard query language for RDF. 
ASPARQL query consists of a set of triples where the subject, predicate, and object can 
consist of variables. The idea is to match the triples in the SPARQL query with the existing 
RDF triples and find solutions to the variables.
SPARQL 1.0 only allows limited operations on matching results or solutions such as filter 
or duplicate elimination, ordering, projection, and triple construction. We need to provide 
more flexible operations such as aggregates, grouping, assignment, and select expressions. 
SPARQL 1.1 provides all these features.
Like SQL, SPARQL selects data from the query dataset by using a SELECT statement to 
determine which subset of the selected data is returned. Also, SPARQL uses a WHERE 
clause to define graph patterns to find a match for in the query data set. A graph pattern 
in a SPARQL WHERE clause consists of the subject, predicate, and object triple to find a 
match for in the data.
SPARQL General Form
PREFIX (Namespace Prefixes)
e.g., PREFIX iot: < http://purl.org/IoT/iot#>
SELECT (Result Set)
e.g., SELECT ?sensorname
WHERE (Query Triple Pattern)
e.g., WHERE iot:?sensorname iot:location iot:?room1
ORDER BY(modifier)
e.g., ORDER BY ?sensorname

ontology language can be applied. We have taken the domain of home automation sce-
nario to provide security to home when occupants are out of home. The actors of the sce-
nario are elucidated below:
•	 IoT application consumers and infrastructure owners: Buy applications and IoT devices 
for their house such as alarm lights/lamp, air-conditioner, etc.
•	 IoT infrastructure and data providers: Home automation device sellers for devices 
such as sensors, actuators, gateway boxes, IoT data feeds from the Cloud such as 
temperature sensor, motion detection sensor, switch actuator, luminosity sensor, 
and gateway box.
•	 IoT application providers: Software providers for the IoT home automation/building 
management domain such as application for security monitoring and application 
for energy monitoring.
•	 IoT semantic interoperability providers: Service providers for the semantic registry 
and the alignment/matchmaking of IoT entities such as ontology alignment, 
matchmaking, message translation, and message transformation.
Representing IoT entities and their alignments
The following ontology namespaces were utilized in the design of the required application 
ontology:
http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn# for conceptualizations related to sensing and obser-
vations of different sensors.
http://www.loa-cnr.it/ontologies/DUL.owl# for high-level generic ones from the DUL 
ontology 
http://purl.org/IoT/iot# for the IoT entities layer of the proposed IoT-ontology namespace.
For the sake of brevity, only the most relevant properties for IoT entities’ registration are 
presented here. A physical object, a lamp can be registered by the end-user in the reposi-
tory as:

Follow the below steps to exploit the Smart Proxy toolset with the abovementioned 
registrations:
•	 Ontology alignment task is carried out on the registrations as a whole, align-
ing classes LampType (label “Light”) and MotionDetectorSignalType (label 
“Motion”) with app1:LightingDevice and app1:HasMovement and they are in 
the ontology using subclass axioms, for example, LampType rdfs:subClassOf 
app1:LightingDevice.
•	 Execute patterns of the iot:hasTarget-related SPARQL queries by performing the 
matchmaking between the registered application and the smart entities.
•	 The message data format examples given with iot:hasTemplate are processed for 
both the control entities’ services and the smart entity’s application by generating an 
OWL ontology representation for a given XML or JSON so that “MotionDetected” 
attribute in DetectionService’s output will get mapped with the “value“ XML tag 
in the application LightService’s MovementDetectorResponse input.

Internet of Things (IoT)
14.1  Introduction
The human being is an innovative creature. The progress of the innovation as discussed 
(Michel 2014) is prompting smart kinds of stuff being evolved for distinguishing, finding, 
detecting, and associating. Also, the technologies are promoting new types of communi-
cation among individuals and things themselves. Innovation constitutes the incredible 
establishments of our survival, which depends on the inevitable activities in cutting edge 
of human life. The modern technology is just the down-to-earth utilization of informa-
tion to a specific region. Researchers always look for and consider better technologies for 
enhancing the strength of debilitated people and attempt to empower those who have 
disabilities to lead as near an ordinary life as would be discreet. As discussed by Sula 
and Spaho (2014), today’s technologies undergo a continual enhancement of different tools 
and utilities varying from low-tech to high-tech which shows man’s superiority over other 
species.
In the course of recent years, it has been observed that there is a relentless increase in 
disabilities among the children in the general population growth. Hasselbring and Glaser 
(2000) discussed that children’s disabilities range from speech and language weaknesses 
to mental hindrance, and more than half were portrayed as having a particular learning 
disability because of a mental disorder. Children who have abilities differ in cause, degree, 
and the impact they have on the educational and learning progress. Innovation has turned 
out to be a practical thing for giving chances to take part in fundamental communication, 
general practice, exploratory, or normal correspondence drills to coordinate their needs 
and capacities. This chapter focuses on the role of Internet of things (IoT) in promoting 
the learning/teaching of children with special needs. Presently, the IoT has become an 
integral part of the radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and future Internet. It allows 
the things to be individually recognized, to establish the position, capture physical data, 
and to establish a communication with the corresponding environment. As discussed by 
Huang and Li (2010), it is known that, in the present situation, there is no medical cure for 
children with autism. Now the major goal is to create an accommodating environment for 
their smooth running of life.

Application of IoT in Autism
This chapter begins with an outline of children with special needs and an initial dis-
course of how modern information technology with smart environment creates a funnel 
for providing education and for enhancing the quality of life of children with autism. 
More detailed sections follow and describe how particular IoT applications and devices 
make it possible for autistic children to learn in a regular manner together with their 
normal, healthy companions’ environment. It concentrates especially on gadgets and 
applications that specifically provide an interface between autistic children and the tech-
nical methodologies. Emphasis is additionally put on recent improvements, with past 
technologies serving as cases of the many effective techniques for adapting to an autistic 
child through technology.
14.1.1  Children with Special Needs
Children with autism have some inabilities that make learning or performing differ-
ent day-to-day activities difficult for them. They may require additional help because 
of their medical, emotional, or learning  issues. As discussed by Jamdeaf (2015), chil-
dren with special needs mainly have mental disorder, which causes them to grow more 
slowly than other normal children. They may have to go for medical treatment or men-
tal therapy to keep them in a normal condition, whereas the normal children do not 
ordinarily require or just need occasionally. We may have the capacity to recognize a 
child with special needs; however, we presumably cannot recognize every one of them. 
Nemours (2016) states that a child could have an issue that isn’t noticeable unless you 
know well that individually. When provided with right instruction and framework, an 
autistic child individually can make a great success to interact with the normal life. In 
any case, to oversee such a child, we have to first comprehend what autism spectrum 
disorders (ASDs) or autism means.
14.1.1.1  What Is ASD?
ASDs are the most widespread neurodevelopmental disorders. Diagnosing children with 
ASD has become a challenging task for many therapists all over the world. It is a cluster of 
developmental disorders consisting of different categories such as pervasive developmen-
tal disorder, classic autism, and Asperger’s syndrome. The intensity of symptoms in ASD 
ranges from moderate to severe, depending on the behavioral part of the child. Research 
on the activities of autistic children observed that their less effective involvement in social 
interaction and imagination, language and communication skill, imagining things and 
stereotype behavior became more difficult to make them what they did not understand. 
There are so many symptoms of this pervasive disorder and the ASD covers all the impair-
ments mentioned above.
Researchers have observed that normally autism appears during the initial three years 
of life of a child and it shows a complex formative inability. It is identified when a child’s 
failure to convey and associate with others is far from an individual interaction. It is nor-
mally a brain disorder that affects a child’s capability to convey, establish relationships 
with environments, and counter perfectly to the society. Notbohm (2005) suggested that 
individuals with autism are not physically disabled and they “look” simply like anyone 
without disability. A recent study (Mighty 2016) has shown that an autistic child may have 
a number of behaviors at similar stages. They can be mildly or severely autistic in different 
ways. Such an individual is therefore said to exhibit behaviors of someone on the range of 
autistic spectrum and has ASDs.

Internet of Things (IoT)
14.1.1.2  Technology Needs to Assist Children with Autism
The vast majority of today’s research is socially assistive research, which focused exclu-
sively on ASDs. It has been observed (Anon 2014) that most of the autistic children are pro-
foundly intrigued and inspired by smart gadgets available around them. By using these 
sorts of assistive advanced gadgets such as PCs, Tablets, and mobiles, they can be more 
comfortable and can cooperate more, settle on decisions, react, increase new attitudes, 
and turn out in to secure zone. Researchers (Sula and Spaho 2014) have suggested that 
these smart kinds of stuff with assistive technology can be used in primary or secondary 
schools to help autistic children in a number of ways to overcome communication barriers 
and build up new dialect abilities.
Nowadays, the progress of technology is important, and researchers and developers are 
determined on designing a range of smart objects/devices that can help users and make 
possible identifying, sensing, locating, and connecting things better. Only one type of 
teaching and learning methods cannot be recommended to the children with autism syn-
drome. In present market scenario, there are several types of IoT applications available to 
meet the requirement of these children. Children suffered from ASD may be uncommonly 
compelled for interpersonal correspondence and association abilities. This leads to the 
motivation to develop gadgets and IoT devices to support their prerequisites for consolida-
tion in communal life. It is not only for enlightening functions or educational purposes or 
for entertainment. By using IoT devices/gadgets, people can confer their feelings to others, 
test/comment on existing substances, and chat among their surroundings.
In this information technology era, the computer-assisted involvement will help autistic 
children practice on their own time or engage them in daily learning what the regularly 
trained teacher cannot give them through proper attention. Also, it may happen that the 
rate of acquisition of skills will be faster than other different manual learning procedures. 
It has been proven that the IoT became an effective way of learning medium for children 
with special needs. IoT helps to take them on their basic practice for social communication 
what they personally need for the potential of abilities in different situations. With the 
massive advancement of smart technologies and enhancement in digital communication 
methods, IoT has become a new paradigm for the development and design of associated 
devices into smart environments. IoT is a vibrant and distributed global network con-
sisting of different objects (Internet connected) including radio-frequency identification 
(RFID), different sensors, different actuators, mouse-controlled and touch-screen applica-
tion, and other smart devices that are essential components for the present and future 
world of Internet.
14.1.2  Background and Functionality of IoT Solutions
In this era, particularly children with ASD may require the help and support of informa-
tion and communication technologies. As discussed by several researchers (Nicolás 2004; 
Takeo and Toshitaka 2007), the IoT is a network of networks where the value-added kinds 
of services are well provided through the proper communication and association of an 
enormous number of items, things, sensors, or gadgets. As shown in Perera et al. (2013), 
the term “IoT” was first authored in 1998. The main motivation of the services provided by 
IoT was that it can be used by anybody and can be connected anywhere, anytime, and with 
anyone. Also it may avail any kind of services using any network. Woodcock and Woolner 
(2007) says that IoT makes it feasible and predictable environments to offer multisensory 
incitement, and cultivate or make it conceivable to work autonomously. Also it helps to

Application of IoT in Autism
build up the limit of capacity for self-control, empowering self-consideration, encourag-
ing attention, and reducing dissatisfaction level of autistic children that may arise from 
committing mistakes. According to Ingersoll and Wainer (2013), with the help of these 
new technologies, autistic children can get closer and promote a better understanding to 
develop their learning skills, which would not be possible without IoT. So IoT helps them 
to interact with the world that has been separated from them in which they initially lived 
(Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014).
IoT application directly visible on the computer screen or any display devices creates the 
actions of interest among autistic children. IoT also creates the infrastructure of information 
and communications through the different network of networks established by different sen-
sors, devices, and objects or things that became value-added services for autism patients. The 
human–computer interaction (HCI) in the success of IoT and peer-to-peer (P2P) products and 
solutions plays a significant role in the development of social communication and language 
skills among autistic children. Also autistic children are now more involved and being highly 
encouraged to use smart devices. The usability of IoT among autistic children helps them for 
more interaction and response to the society, creates new talents and make them self-sufficient.
The significant objectives for IoT applications are the making of smart products, smart 
cities, smart buildings, smart health application, smart social communication, and many 
more smart spaces or environments. Today the implementation and deployment of P2P 
network is the most challenging research (Huang and Li 2010) in IoT because P2P is an 
excellent approach and a suitable platform for interacting robot control and e-learning 
for autistic children. Similarly, the parallel research has focused on low-range network 
such as Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) which covers a few meter radiuses. It 
helps out to connect the devices or gadgets to nearby computers with wireless connec-
tivity. An Assistive Technology (AT) followed by IoT such as Ambient Assisted Living 
(AAL) also supports autistic children to learn their daily activities and allows them to be 
self-­dependent and secure lifestyle. Also this technology provides learning environment 
support by the combination of smart technologies and IoT framework.
Researchers have suggested that before recommending the IoT devices it is highly neces-
sary to evaluate the characteristics of different activities of autistic children, which include:
	
1.	Age factor of the child
	
2.	Proper diagnosis of the problem
	
3.	Suitable learning methods
	
4.	Capability to sit and use the system
	
5.	Interesting kind of objects
	
6.	Choosing the kind of environment, and many more
The different analysis proved that smart environment helps autistic children to be 
more determined on their interest in learning and enhances the ability of their attention 
toward usual activities. As a result, the performance of these children regarding day-to-day 
­problem-solving task become easier. It is observed that because of this technology a child 
with autism will be able to increase the interest to learn the new social skills, social languages, 
and behaviors, and achieve moderate academic performance. This chapter is focused on the 
different functionalities of IoT solutions. Although at present there is no therapy for autism, 
the major aim is to care and train autistic children by using such IoT devices that are the key 
part of a supportive environment to connect and communicate them with the real world.

Internet of Things (IoT)
14.1.3  Strategies for Use of IoT and Media-Based Tools
Children with ASD are confronting a few difficulties that IoT framework can address as 
discussed by Cafiero (2008). Various general characteristics include:
•	 The problem with communication—The key characteristics of life characterizing atti-
tudes, it is the major problem in ASD. IoT offers specialized devices in the area of 
perusing, composing, and talking.
•	 A problem with the complex sign—IoT offers the capacity for making a scope of 
images, from single image to different and more mixed images.
•	 The problem with emotional and social learning—Full of feeling and social learning 
happens when one is involved with others. Innovation can go about as a support 
and an extension between correspondence accomplices.
According to Woodcock and Woolner (2007), to support the engagement of kids with 
ASDs using IoT technology, it is essential to:
	
1.	Comprehend the prerequisites of autistic children and their educators and care 
takers
	
2.	Develop a versatile, intuitive IoT environment that will support the desire of autis-
tic children
	
3.	Design an IoT framework of broadly useful philosophy empowering such prereq-
uisites to be captured and implemented in programming outline
	
4.	Contribute to the development of user-centered design and learning ergonomics
Assistive technologies are growing at a great extent, from normal innovation to IoT 
implementation in this present digital stage. It is characterized by Michel (2004) as “a part 
of an object, or framework, whether procured commercially off the rack, changed, and that 
is utilized to increment, or enhances the functional abilities of children with disabilities.” 
Today many companies are developing different assistive solutions to help autistic chil-
dren. These IoT-based assistive solutions are classified (McClanahan and Krantz 2010) as 
a group of “low,” “mid,” and “high” technology. It is very difficult to present here every 
accessible item. However, the following have been discussed for the overview of the differ-
ent development of helpful assistive technologies that are used to support the requirement 
of autistic children.
14.1.3.1  Low Technology
Low-tech dealings can be utilized as a part of various approaches to giving the visual 
data for the child. Normally autistic children are comfortable to handle visual data rather 
than sound-related data. Particularly pictorial data has been appeared to be very useful. 
Visual data enormously expands the child’s perception of what is anticipated from him or 
her and is significantly more viable than sound-related data. Henceforth, most low-tech 
approaches have a cardboard-based or basic paper form. Visual bearings pick up, keep 
up, and refocus a child’s consideration and attention. Visual information is not equipped 
with any electronic or battery-operated systems. As discussed by Pierce and Schreibman 
(1994), basically visual data is of low cost and simple to utilize. It also helps children 
to enhance their independent behaviors. There are many visual information kiosks

301
Application of IoT in Autism
available in the market, such as Clipboard, photo album, normal whiteboard, highlight 
taps, and many more. Figure 14.1 shows the low tech methods of aiding comprehension 
skills, using visual schedules, activity schedules, and calendars. Visual activity schedules 
or calendars help many autistic children to accompany with their daily routines to under-
stand what is going on, what will be the next schedule coming up, and what has already 
gone. It helps children to engage in a particular activity. McClanahan and Krantz (2010) 
suggests that these common low-tech approaches focus on enhancing a child’s expressive 
communication skills.
14.1.3.2  Mid Technology
Mid technology deals with simple electronic devices or battery-operated devices that 
have narrow improvements in technology. Examples of this include Language Master, 
recorder, calculators, timers, overhead projector, and voice output devices. A self-­
contained and inexpensive electronic voice output device can be used for the diagnosis 
of autism. As ­discussed by Schepis et al. (1998), the voice output communication aids 
(VOCA) produces a digitized voice when a symbol or picture is selected on its display 
screen. It has been found that autistic children easily accept and adopt the functionalities 
of VOCAs.
14.1.3.2.1  Voice Output Communication Aids
According to Harris (2014), VOCA has different shapes and sizes, with different synthe-
sized voices, allowed to record speech. Some VOCAs may use plastic or paper sheets with 
symbols or words to identify the messages or words that have been recorded, as shown in 
Figure 14.2. Other VOCAs will display the symbols or words on their display screen.
•	 Single message VOCAs speak a recorded message.
•	 Message Sequencer VOCAs allow the user to have a chain of messages.
•	 Overlay VOCAs permit the child to select from a number of messages, pictures, 
and words, and symbols are located above the keys to explain which one will say 
which message.
•	 Dynamic Screen VOCAs display symbols or graphics on the screen rather than on 
paper overlays.
•	 Talk Pad: The gadget can be programmed with simple 1–4 step commands. 
The child is motivated to hit the buttons and complete the series of steps.

Internet of Things (IoT)
14.1.3.3  High Technology
A number of studies show that information technology provides support for training and 
therapy for autistic children. It not only provides support to increase the learning ability 
but also extensively reduces the disturbing behaviors of the autistic children and expands 
consistency with directions of learning (Moore et al. 2000; Pleinis and Romanczyk 1985). 
Different software and tools have been developed to expand perusing and general and 
social relational abilities of children with autism. According to Cheng et al. (2003), com-
puter technology in a teaching environment for autistic children helps increase focused 
attention, generalization of skills, changing of behavior, etc., whereas in the traditional 
approaches of learning to autism the child fails in some aspects.
14.1.4  Current Developments and Applications of IoT Technologies
This section discusses a few ultramodern and new applications of IoT technology for 
providing guidance and help to children suffering from ASDs. Several studies have 
identified that caution is necessary when taking into consideration the application 
of IoT made by the large amount of modern research improvements, as indicated in 
Figure 14.3. Low-tech technology became helpful for autistic children to establish their 
daily schedule and it would be easy for children to modify the schedule themselves. 
High-tech technology could support in training additional complicated processing. A 
noticeable changes has been guaranteed in the study of autism by using the progressive 
technology. However, most research (Michel 2004) results have not been used to wider 
testing. The right assures can only be exposed over time, as systematic, restricted sci-
entific testings are approved. This present changing situation, following IoT devices, is 
coordinated to the particulars of the required theme. It helps the dual target of empow-
ering socialization and encouraging collaboration among ­children with ASD.
14.1.5  Wearable Devices
As explained by Fletcher et al. (2010), wearable sensors are successfully implanted for a 
long-term constant physiological monitoring, which is vital for the cure and supervision 
of many neurological disorders, mental disorder issues, and chronic illnesses. Wearable 
sensors also have integrated into fashion accessories, garments, wristbands, hats, shoes, 
socks, headphones, eyeglasses, etc. These gadgets sometimes include the accelerometers 
FIGURE 14.2

Application of IoT in Autism
and temperature sensors to classify and monitor an autistic child’s physical activities. The 
IoT-based wearable sensors framework is generally assembled on a three-tier structure. 
According to Lidwina and Jayanthy (2016), the first is wearable sensors that accumulate 
the health particulars; the second is communication gadgets that constitute a wireless net-
working which facilitates the process. The third is a cloud-based online repository for 
continuing storage of a child’s activities to further assist concerned parents or guardians 
with their monitoring information. A number of control sensors are used for collecting 
the physical activity signals and uploading. Furthermore, a lot of sensors are operated for 
detecting the emotional status of the child by comparing the sensor data with the pre-
defined normal scenario values.
The representation of wearable technologies shows the changes from digital replication 
and separation (simulation) to digital connectivity and responsiveness (augmentation) and 
follows the three-tier system architecture as explained in Figure 14.4. The wearable gad-
gets are very sensitive to adapt and recognize their users, identify their place and posi-
tions, followed by the specific activities being carried out. In recent years (Viseu 2003), 
a great increase has been noticed in the variety of wearable technologies available in the

open market for autistic children. The report (Bower and Sturman 2015) on 10 April 2015 
from Vandrico Wearable Technologies database (http://vandrico.com/ wearables) stated 
that about 296 types of gadgets are available in the field of entrainment, gaming, lifestyles, 
and many more areas. As discussed by Barfield and Caudell (2014), all wearable devices 
are integrated with a large number of various sensors that are capable of gathering the 
following information:
	
1.	Acoustic information such as volume, frequency, and pitch
	
2.	Mechanical information such as displacement, force, position, and acceleration
	
3.	Environmental information such as humidity and temperature
	
4.	Biological information such as temperature, neural activities, heart rate, and 
pulse rate
	
5.	Optical information such as light wave frequency, refraction, luminance, and­ 
brightness.
14.1.6  Tracking Devices
As we know children with ASD are getting lost due to their inexpressible behavior. 
Parents are worried to provide the safe environment to their kids when they are out-
side of the home or away from a safety zone. Healy (2012) has noticed that ASDs are 
more often found in younger kids and the risk can be major issues. Keeping in view of 
this problem for an autistic child the tracking devices are developed, and by using such 
devices autistic children do not go for missing. The use of tracking devices is not com-
pulsory and it is not mandatory for parents to use such devices for their autistic child. 
However, if parents will feel that the tracking devices are useful for safety of their kids, 
they may use it without hesitation. Now, the tracking devices can be used in different 
ways and it depends on the work habits of the individual autistic child. The wearable 
devices are like anklets, belt loops, clothing, and bracelets. The system will track the 
child by using global positioning system (GPS) and will send an emergency message to 
the nearby caretaker of the autistic child. According to the journal Pediatrics published in 
2012 (Kelly 2014), analysis shows that around 49% of autistic children are gone missing 
at least once in their childhood time. Around 65% of autistic children reached the close 
call with traffic accidents.
The benefits of using tracking device for autistic children will provide an additional 
safety and will also help escape the life-frightening situations. Next couple of years we 
trust and will see a stream of GPS tracking devices designed particularly for the mental 
imbalance group or autistic children. Most of the guardians do not know that there are 
some good GPS tracking devices available to track their autistic child or special disabilities.
Here are the lists of a few awesome gadgets that can help track mentally unbalanced or 
autistic children and prevent them from getting lost.
14.1.6.1  AngelSense
This device was launched in 2014. It provides the safety solution with voice monitoring 
system. AngelSense is also GPS enabled and is entirely used by autistic and other special 
need children as they often wander or dart off. As explained by Lewis (2014), although it 
helps for GPS tracking and is connected with voice monitoring system, it provides maxi-
mum protection and security for autistic children.

14.1.6.2  Amber Alert GPS
The Amber Alert (Figure 14.5) is a very small and pocket-sized (around 7 cm) GPS device 
and is more child-friendly. It uses the AT&T’s 3G network to call the parents by the child or 
vice versa through a touch button mounted on the device. So it supports to track the autis-
tic children by their parents. It has no display screen and cannot access the Internet, but it 
helps to protect the child from cyberbullying. It is easier to keep inside the child’s pocket 
and parents will be able to track their child’s location using browser, an online portal, or 
mobile phone applications accompanying iOS and Android. If the child will face any panic 
attack, he or she can just press the button and a message will be sent to the parent and up 
to 10 authorized caretakers. It has a rechargeable battery that can last up to 40 hours. This 
device also sends a text or email alert to the parent or guardian if the child comes within 
500 feet of a registered domestic network area.
14.1.6.3  Pocket Finder
It is a very reliable gadget (Figure 14.6) for autistic children that could help them prevent 
a tragedy in their day-to-day life. In this passionate world, parents may track their child 
from anywhere and may allow accessing the data from the local website or by using free 
mobile applications. It gives more peace of mind to the parents as they know that they are 
well connected with their children.
14.1.6.4  Filip
As a necessity, most of the parents need to reach their autistic children. A majority of par-
ents do not need their children to have a cell phone during their teenage years. All things

considered, cell phones accompany definite risks for children and also the risk of loss of 
the phone. But to avoid this issue, Filip has made and designed a simple mobile gadget 
that can be worn on the wrist of the children aged between 5 and 12 years (Figure 14.7). By 
using this gadget, a child can communicate five reliable contacts and can also get in touch 
with his/her parents, relatives, and friends.
This gadget has a lot of features with built-in GSM, GPS, and Wi-Fi facilities. It will help 
parents for tracking their children by using iOS or Android applications. It has facilities to 
create multiple profiles and restore for more than one child. Its GPS sensor is embedded 
with geofencing features, and because of this reason Filip is called as “Safe zones.”
14.1.6.5  Trax
Trax is a small GPS tracker that can be found suitable for all purposes in anyplace and any-
where. Simply use the mobile application and you will observe the tracker moving continu-
ously on a map. It will make safe zones (GEO-fences) and notice about quick developments 
and monitor and track the distance. It has waterproof system integrated with lots of modern 
technology and covers two years of free roaming facilities. The use of Trax (Figure 14.8) 
is absolutely safe and user-friendly. It runs with Android/iOS application equipped

network for kids. Parents can effortlessly identify the whereabouts of their autistic chil-
dren any place at any time through their cell phones. Once you install Guardian applica-
tion, it becomes the part of its network to enhance the safety for your children around. 
Guardian has a vast network. If a child is missing, parents can use Guardian application 
and effectively trace out their missing child within a few minutes. With the support of 
social network and integration of latest sophisticated technology, Guardian can help out 
to provide more and more safety to special needs children. It is composed of two seg-
ments: the wearable waterproof Watchman gadget itself and an iOS application. The gad-
get shown in Figure 14.9 can be worn like bracelets, a pendant, or a clasp, and it speaks 
with the parent’s telephone through Bluetooth technology.
Guardian will allow parents to check if their child is with other persons that they have 
added to their safety contact list, who are additionally running the same application. 
Furthermore, if the child comes quite close to anybody using the application, the location 
will be sent to the child’s parents through the cloud technology. This gadget is powered by 
a replaceable battery and the charge will continue 5 to 10 months depending on the use. 
It covers a maximum range of 70 meters or 230 feet. It will be compatible with iPhones 4S,

The more features with BiKN is that not only does your iPhone discover your stuff but also 
your things can help you discover your iPhone even if it is on turned-off mode, muted, or 
dead. You do not lose your keys or purse; the Bikn may be an incredible arrangement.
This Bikn tracking system shown in Figure 14.11 comprises an iPhone case, an applica-
tion, and up to eight tags that can be appended to things of your choice. That case can 
track the radio frequency tags, which can be attached to your or children’s belongings, for 
example, key chains, packs, or child’s dress (while the children are wearing them). Both 
the case and the tags must be charged to work. Now you can monitor or track your stuff/
child in three ways. The first is Find mode, in which you have to use the application to find 
lost things by the help of the display screen and a beep sound tone. The second is Leash 
mode in which an alert will sound on both the case and the tag if a labeled thing moves to 
a distance from the case which a user can measure. Finally, there is Page mode in which a 
client can bring about various tags and additionally different bases to sound a caution or 
just to find something by sound alone.
14.1.6.9  HereO
HereO is the world’s earliest smallest real-time cellular-connected GPS tracking device. It 
is just like a colorful watch that looks very cute and attractive for children. This is embed-
ded with a clock so that the child can show off and find time. Parents can track the where-
abouts of their children through iOS or Android app. This helps to make synchronize with 
parents’ mobile and provide a map popup showing the child’s location. HereO shown in 
Figure 14.12 creates a geofenced safe zone and allows the parent to track their child when 
the child goes beyond the restricted boundary by sending an alert message to the parent’s 
mobile phone. It is designed in such a way that children above age 3 can use it, and parents 
will feel free from any type of dangerous situation for their children. HereO GPS gadget 
is more durable with waterproof system and withstands even the heaviest of play by chil-
dren. Its battery life is more than 60 hours and depends on the use; however, it will send 
an alert message if the battery goes down.

14.1.7  Head-Mounted Display Products: Google Glass
Children with ASDs are facing problems in social communication, facial expression, and 
eye contacts during face-to-face interaction. So the Stanford specialists created a facial rec-
ognition programming, particularly for Glass. The software is a mentor for helping the 
children to judge the correct emotions on people’s face.
According to Smith (2015), Google Glass shown in Figure 14.21 is a comfort gadget 
that makes possible to detect the facial expression and can record the moments of an 
interaction of the child. An autistic child has a difficulty to identify and study some-
body’s look and judge what they are thinking or feeling. Google is utilizing wearable 
frames, Google Glass, along with the infrastructure designed to bridge the gap. The 
glass is integrated with facial recognition software synchronized with a front faced 
camera and enables the technology to get facial information. In the right corner of the 
glass, children will see icons of feelings like “sad” or “happy” so they can understand 
the feelings and also learn at their own pace to remember it naturally. The child may 
wear the gadget every day for short ­sessions where he/she will collaborate with sur-
rounds face to face, talking and playing. The software keeps running on a cell phone, 
which records the sessions.
14.1.8  IoT Apps for Children with ASDs
When searching for applications (apps) for children suffered from ASDs, it is essential 
to take a look at all educational and instructive apps. An autistic child may have a great 
number of learning needs similar to that of a normal child. The following list was created 
(Carrington 2015) to give applications in view of normal learning qualities and attributes 
that are used for children with ASD. Remember that all autistic children learn in a differ-
ent way and selecting applications should be based on the child’s learning behavior. This 
rundown is just a testing of applications accessible for every aptitude region. This is not,

nor is it intended, to be a conclusive rundown. This list is planned to give you a beginning 
idea and a method of reasoning for selecting certain applications.
The Pedagogy Wheel shown in Figure 14.22 was developed by Carrington (2015) and is 
intended to help instructors think—deliberately, reasonably, and with a view to long-term, 
enormous picture results—about how they utilize apps in their teaching methodology. 
The Pedagogy Wheel is about attitudes and mindsets. It is a state of mind about advanced 
digital age training of education which supports inspiration, psychological improvement, 
learning alteration, and enduring learning objectives.
14.1.8.1  iPrompts® PRO
iPrompts (Figure 14.23) is the first visual support application discussed in Tzvi (2011) to 
provide the visual structure for autistic children. It collaborated with StoryMaker which 
is the premier app for making and exhibiting Social Stories, including selective materi-
als from “Carol Gray.” Another section of SpeechPrompts, coordinated effort with the 
Yale Child Study Center, gives activities to practice rate, pitch, stress, and power of dis-
course. Components of all applications depend on research, granted by the U.S. Branch of 
Educational program. This application offers the following list of features: Picture Library, 
Schedules, Countdown, Choices, Stories, Academy, Video Prompts, Voice Match, and Voice 
Chart. The picture library contains 35 envelopes with many pictures; in addition, children

can stack more pictures from their picture library or rapidly include photographs ­utilizing 
Google, Bing, or Flickr. These pictures can be utilized to make plans, commencements, 
decisions, and stories.
14.1.8.2  Visual Schedules and Task Managers
As Krull (2015) said that adapting visually is an extraordinary mode for some individu-
als, including various children and elders with ASD. For a few, utilizing visual timetables 
and assignment administration frameworks can have all the effect. In spite of the fact that 
not for everybody, utilizing the cell phones with applications permit us to rapidly include 
photos, sounds, videos on the spot to help the child in need.
14.1.8.3  Choiceworks Scheduler
The main page of Choiceworks shown in Figure 14.24 is embeded with feature boards like 
“Schedules,” “Waiting,” and “Feelings” which can be selected by a child or parent. One 
can utilize pictures from the Choiceworks program or picture/photographs of their deci-
sion and consolidate these with customized sound recordings, which can be printed and 
shared. The “Schedules Board” provides an assignment with clocks. At the point when a 
part of the assignment on the left is finished, it can be dragged to a relating square on the 
right, where it gets a green check mark. At the point when a clock goes off, a general mes-
sage appears on the screen and the clock reads “Done.” The “Waiting Board” provides a 
clock and two exercises to browse while the individual waits. The “Feelings Board” pro-
vides two adaptable techniques when one feels, and two exercises to do after the technique 
has been finished. For instance, the specimen “disturbed” board says, “When I am vexed, 
I can get help or enjoy a reprieve.”

communication abilities. Its creative components support children, parents, trainers, and 
specialists to quickly customize the vocabulary and settings. Proloquo2Go is used by indi-
viduals with ASD, Down’s syndrome, and cerebral paralysis, and different other sufferers. 
It is accessible in English, French, and Spanish, including provincial and bilingual support. 
It has three levels: Basic Communication, Intermediate Core, and Advanced Core. It helps 
to enhance the language skills and vocabulary of the autistic or mental disorder children.
14.1.8.6  Pictello: Talking Visual Story Creator
Everybody loves to tell the fun and innovative stories (Goldthwait 2016). Pictello helps 
make a social story, visual timetable, or a slideshow of different occasion pictures for an 
autistic child. It provides a breeze to make and share all these stuff with the child. This app 
allows to record one’s own voice or may use natural text to speech voices, and it is an ideal 
app for visual narration. Every page in a Pictello as presented in Figure 14.27 shows a story 
that comprises a photograph or video and some content, and it can be read thoroughly. 
So anyone might hear by a Text to Speech voice or your own recorded sounds. The child 
can communicate by transforming pictures and recording videos into talking story books 
with Pictello.
Pictello helps to create the proficiency as follows:
•	 Support reading with word-by-word content highlighting.
•	 Develop composing and spelling with implicit word expectation and Speak.
•	 Create stories to show educational and social attitudes.
•	 Play stories page by page or as a slideshow.
•	 Use text to speech voices to pay particular attention to the story.

14.1.8.7  iCommunicate
Children may use the iCommunicate app (Figure 14.28) to record their own voice and 
make a visual schedule planner. This is integrated with text-to-speech including 20 voices 
of English, Italian, Norwegian, French, Swedish, Spanish, and German. It allows sharing 
of pictures and communicating with email or iTunes as file sharing.
14.1.8.8  Talking Tom Cat
Talking Tom Cat shown in Figure 14.29 is an entertainment app that reacts to the child’s 
touch and repeats all that he or she says in an amusing voice. By pushing or snatching his 
tail will make him murmur, fall over, or scratch the screen. The child can share the record-
ings of the cat’s response and reactions over YouTube, Facebook, email, or MMS as a novel 
video message. So it helps the autistic children to self-learn the responses and reactions.

14.1.9  Benefits of Using Assistive IoT Technologies to Support ASD Children
IoT assistive technology is a service that specifically helps (Garretson et al. 1990) a child with 
an inability in the determination, procurement, or utilization of general assistive gadgets. 
By handling of individual assistive gadgets that are designed for them as indicated by their 
capability and inability, children can enhance their quality of learning and increase new 
aptitudes. The instructors, parents, and experts can also use and suggest such IoT assistive 
gadgets by knowing the ability and inability of the autistic children for their better learn-
ing. This smart environment can help children with ASD to upgrade them, and children 
will have the capacity to learn new dialect abilities, social attitudes, proper conduct, and 
scholarly aptitudes to enable them for performing and completing day-to-day activities.
14.1.10  Future Scope
Researchers keep on dedicating themselves to disentangling and finding the causes 
behind extreme ASD children cases every day. Sometimes, the symptoms of autism are 
very difficult to differentiate for the parents of such children.
Keeping this in view, in far future, billions of data spouting devices will be connected 
with the Internet. The real work that can be taken lies in outlining minimal, nonintruding 
wearable gadgets. Better and more grounded calculations and algorithms can be devel-
oped to enhance the productivity of grouping and diminish the idleness. Currently, there 
is no particular diagnosis for autism; in any case, with proper preparing, training, and 
instruction by support of today’s IoT gadgets, children with other disabilities and children 
with extreme autistic syndrome can learn and make themselves feel comfortable. With the 
rapid growth of smart wearable technology in the health sector, industry has leveraged 
the level of healthcare management for individuals with autism. New technologies can 
improve communication, help in the skill development, and enhance the ability to learn.
14.1.11  Conclusion
There has been advance in using the IoT structure for assistive technologies in vari-
ous fields, for example, incorporation and autonomous living for seniors. Such smart

environment and related gadgets could have extraordinary potential for conveying and 
filling in as method for assistive advances for autistic individuals and their families too. 
Besides, the low expenses for such advancements could make them accessible for locales 
with low wages, potentially helping enhancing the lives of individuals with a mental 
imbalance and their families in underserviced and financially tested provinces of the 
world. With the massive advancement in smart technologies and improvement in digital 
communication methods, the “Internet of Thing” has turned into another standard for the 
plan and improvement of associated gadgets and smart environments.
The smart device can help to alert and clarify the needs of children, and also they and 
their parents may feel less pressure as it provides ubiquitous healthcare monitoring system. 
We analyzed the commitment of every arrangement of IoT toward enhancing the efficiency 
and effectiveness of autistic children for their way of life and also of society. Unmistakably 
more and more wearable IoT solutions will advance their life easier over the coming years. 
We accept that further research that addresses open difficulties will help extend more IoT 
arrangements to strengthen the present IoT solutions. This chapter is projected to empha-
size the prospective benefits of the IoT serving as a means of distributing services and 
improving the value of living of autistic children and supporting their families.
