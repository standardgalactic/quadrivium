About the Authors
Bill Slavicsek: Bill Slavicsek began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplay-
ing game with his friends during his formative teenage years in New York City.
This was in 1977, the same year that Star Wars and Terry Brooks’s The Sword
of Shannara debuted. This trilogy of epic fantasy combined with comic books
and horror novels to forever influence Bill’s outlook on life and entertainment.
In 1986, Bill’s hobby became his career when he joined the staff of West End
Games. There, as an editor and game designer, Bill worked on a number of
board games and roleplaying games, including Ghostbusters, Paranoia, Star
Wars: The Roleplaying Game, and Torg: Roleplaying the Possibility Wars. Later,
Bill went on to use his vast knowledge of the Star Wars films and associated
extensions to write two editions of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe for
Lucasfilm, Ltd. (published by Del Rey Books). 
1n 1993, Bill joined the staff of TSR, Inc., then publishers of the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game lines, as a game designer and editor. His design credits for the
company include the Alternity Science Fiction Game (which he co-designed
with Richard Baker), the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game, the d20 Star Wars
Roleplaying Game, the Star Wars Miniatures Game, Urban Arcana, Council of
Wyrms, and the Eberron Campaign Setting. 
Since 1997, Bill has been the Director of Roleplaying Games Research and
Development for Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the company that now publishes
all DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels and game products. He oversaw the creation of
the d20 Roleplaying Game System and the newest edition of the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. Bill leads a talented staff of game designers, developers, and
editors who produce award-winning game products for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
and other d20 System game lines, including roleplaying game supplements
and accessories, adventures and campaign books, and prepainted plastic
miniatures. He lives with his wife Michele, two cats, and more comics, toys,
and books than he knows what to do with — and that’s okay by him. 
Richard Baker: Richard Baker is an award-winning game designer and a 
best-selling author. He’s worked on the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game lines since
1991. Rich traces his D&D experience back to 1979, when he began playing
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game as a 7th-grader. He spent a significant amount
of his high school and college years playing D&D at every opportunity, and
after serving as a surface warfare officer in the United States Navy, Rich decided
to take a shot at working on the game he grew up playing — and so he joined
the staff of TSR, Inc. and became a game designer. 

Rich’s list of D&D design credits numbers over 50 game products, including
the Origins Award-winning Birthright Campaign Setting, the Alternity Science
Fiction Roleplaying Game (which he co-designed with Bill Slavicsek), and the
newest edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. He has also served as cre-
ative director for the Alternity and FORGOTTEN REALMS game lines. As an author,
Rich has published seven fantasy and science fiction novels, including City of
Ravens, Forsaken House, and the New York Times bestseller Condemnation.
Rich is currently employed as a senior game designer at Wizards of the Coast,
Inc. and works every day on new products for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
He married his college sweetheart Kim in 1991; they have two daughters,
Alex and Hannah. When he’s not writing (a rare occurrence), Rich likes to
hike in the Cascades, play wargames, and root for the Philadelphia Phillies —
because somebody has to.
Dedication
Bill Slavicsek: To everyone who ever imagined an amazing adventure, I offer
this key to D&D. When I first found the game, it helped focus and expand my
imagination and creativity. And it was a lot of fun. Today, I still have fun play-
ing the game, and my gaming group meets every Thursday evening to brave
whatever new challenges I dream up for them. I hope you’ll find the same
outlet for imagination and fun as I’ve enjoyed for almost thirty years.
Richard Baker: To Kim, Alex, and Hannah for being patient with me through
nigh-constant work in evenings and on weekends for many months now. I
promise that I’m going to take my computer for a drive deep into the woods
sometime soon and leave it there so it can’t ever find its way home again.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Bill Slavicsek: The current edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game owes its
existence to a lot of talented people. The work that Rich and I have done on
this For Dummies book would not have been possible if not for the original
effort of a formidable team of creatives and business people. Peter Adkison,
for purchasing TSR, Inc., merging its products and staff with Wizards of the
Coast, Inc., and providing the vision for what the new edition of the game
would be. My creative team on the massive redesign project, which included
Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, Skip Williams, Richard Baker, Kim Mohan, Julia

Martin, John Rateliff, Ed Stark, Dawn Murin, Todd Lockwood, and Sam Wood.
The business team, past and present, who help bring D&D products to market,
which includes Ryan Dancey, Keith Strohm, Cindy Rice, Mary Kirchoff, Anthony
Valterra, Chris Toepker, Liz Schuh, Mary Elizabeth Allen, and Charles Ryan.
I have to acknowledge the efforts of my current staff. This amazing collection
of designers, developers, and editors work everyday to push the envelope
and expand the horizons of our products, and as much as I lead them, they
influence the way I think about and approach game design and D&D. Every
part of this For Dummies book owes at least a little to the ideas and work of
Richard Baker, Michele Carter, Andy Collins, Bruce Cordell, Jesse Decker,
Michael Donais, Rob Heinsoo, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Stacy Longstreet,
Michelle Lyons, Kim Mohan, David Noonan, Christopher Perkins, John Rateliff,
Stephen Schubert, Matthew Sernett, Ed Stark, Chris Thomasson, Rob Watkins,
Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, and James Wyatt.
Finally, thanks to everyone at Wiley Publishing who worked with us on this
book, including Melody Layne, Christopher Morris, and Jean Rogers, and to
everyone at Wizards of the Coast, Inc., who help us make great games on a
regular basis.
Richard Baker: Many people of exceptional creativity have worked on the
D&D game over the years. Without the work of game designers, editors, and
artists such as Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, Jim Ward, Kim Mohan, Zeb Cook,
Jeff Grubb, Steve Winter, Bruce Nesmith, Tim Brown, Troy Denning, Roger
Moore, Ed Greenwood, Mike Carr, Harold Johnson, Andrea Hayday, Jon Pickens,
Lawrence Schick, Skip Williams, Dave Sutherland, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore,
and countless others, D&D would not have grown into the beloved hobby of
millions of fans across the world. Countless other authors, artists, develop-
ers, and editors have contributed over the years; we’re sorry that we can’t
thank them all.
A special acknowledgement is in order for Peter Atkinson, Ryan Dancey, and
other folks who were instrumental in bringing the D&D game and many of its
designers to Wizards of the Coast, Inc. Through their efforts, they reinvented
and reinvigorated the game at a difficult and crucial time in its life cycle.
A special thank you to good friends and colleagues who have shared in the
authors’ own D&D games over the years. Rich would like to thank Ed Stark,
John Rateliff, David Eckelberry, Shaun and Miranda Horner, David Wise,
Thomas Reid, David Noonan, James Wyatt, Warren Wyman, Duane Maxwell,
Andy Weedon, Dale Donovan, Bud Stiles, Thomas Chatburn, Tom Herrington,
Doug McNichol, Gary Canter, and Clayton Ball. My games have been the
better thanks to your participation.

Foreword 
T
wenty-five years ago, I was looking for employment as an editor. What I
found, in addition to a great job with Dragon Magazine, was this game
called DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.
I could tell just by looking through those early rulebooks that the game was
in a world all its own. The ideas excited me, and the atmosphere they created
was exhilarating. However, those rules didn’t do a good job of explaining how
to actually play the game, and how to get the most out of the experience.
As D&D has evolved over the years, the rules have devoted more and more
space to that sort of advice — but DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is, and always will be,
a complex, multifaceted game with countless choices and options. Those of
us at Wizards of the Coast who create the books that keep the game vibrant
and growing will be the first to admit that for a new player, absorbing the
Player’s Handbook can be a daunting task.
That’s where Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies comes in. With this book, Bill
Slavicsek and Richard Baker break down the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS experience
into its component parts, making each piece of the whole easy to understand
and appreciate.
If their names aren’t familiar to you, I’ll tell you that Bill and Rich are experts
at what they do. As professional writers, they have each created or contributed
to dozens of D&D rulebooks and adventures over the last decade and then
some. As accomplished Dungeon Masters and players of the game, they bring
their love of D&D and their knowledge of the rules to the table every time they
get a group together.
D&D is a game about rules. It’s also a game about teamwork and social inter-
action. It’s also about many other things, if you want it to be. But at the most
fundamental level, it’s a game that’s meant to be fun to play.
Bill and Rich know how to have fun playing the game and how to make it
enjoyable for everyone else. Read on, and let them show you what I mean.

Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies

Introduction
You crave action and adventure. You revel in the fantastic. You want to
play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game has been around
for more than 30 years, and it stands as the pinnacle of fantasy-adventure
games (also known as roleplaying games). The concepts and play patterns of
D&D (as it is affectionately called) harken back to the games of make-believe
that almost everyone played as a little kid. However, D&D provides form and
structure, making game play more satisfying and robust for kids and adults
alike.
This book makes the mysterious and often arcane world of fantasy roleplay-
ing, specifically the DUNGEON & DRAGONS game, easier to understand and faster
to get into. Get ready to open your imagination, roll some dice, and battle
dragons and other magical monsters.
About This Book
We wrote this book to make our favorite hobby game more accessible to every
fantasy and gaming fan, from the novice who enjoys fantasy novels such as 
The Lord of the Rings trilogy and has a passing curiosity about DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS, to the seasoned D&D player who goes to every convention and has
been playing since Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson published the original White
Box version of the game. Whether you have yet to play your first game or have
been in a regular gaming group for years, our mission is to measurably increase
the fun you have playing D&D and your proficiency with the game.
As a new player, this book shows you the basics of the game. You end up with
a character to play and enough understanding to confidently take your place
at any gaming table. Read this book today, grab a copy of the D&D Player’s
Handbook, and you can play tomorrow without worry or confusion. D&D is a
game. Games are fun. We hope to make learning to play fun, too.
For experienced players, we provide hints and tips to elevate your level of play.
Character creation, character advancement, combat and encounter strategies,
gamemastering — we cover it all. It doesn’t matter if you’ve played once or a
hundred times; you can find something in this book to make you a better D&D
player or gamemaster (known as a Dungeon Master in D&D lingo).

Why You Need This Book
Novices need Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies because it’s written by D&D
experts to serve as the most comprehensive introduction to the D&D game.
You’re going to learn things about D&D and fantasy roleplaying that many sea-
soned gamers still haven’t discovered. Do you know the ins and outs of attacks
of opportunity? What the best class and race combos are? How to make the
most of your character’s key abilities? Which monsters can be brought down
by what spells and weapons? You can find the answers to all kinds of D&D
questions within these pages. And what if you already know a lot about the
game? Get ready to learn a good deal more. We’ve filled this book with inside
tips and behind-the-curtain details that you rarely encounter outside the 
hallowed walls of Wizards of the Coast’s fabled RPG R&D department.
We believe that DUNGEONS & DRAGONS speaks to and feeds the human condi-
tion. D&D is a game of the imagination, building on the myths and fantasies
that have shaped our culture. D&D is a game of endless possibilities, where
the only limit on what can happen is what you can imagine. D&D is a social
experience, a fun and exciting activity that combines group storytelling and
fantasy iconology with strategic challenges and dice rolling. Nothing else —
no computer game, no board game, no movie — comes close to delivering
the interactive and unlimited adventure of the D&D experience.
From the days of telling stories about trolls and dragons and knights in shining
armor around a campfire to the high-tech equivalent that involves computers
and high-speed Internet connections, make-believe has advanced along 
with society. Today, one of the purest expressions of the game is DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS. No other outlet for the adventures of armored warriors and powerful
wizards is as versatile, creative, or fun as D&D. Get ready to go explore some
dungeons and bash some monsters!
How to Use This Book
There’s no right or wrong way to use this book. Read it from cover to cover or
glance at the table of contents and dive into the chapters or sections that most
interest you. If you’re a new player, we suggest starting with Part I. You also
want to become intimately familiar with the glossary and refer to it often as
you explore these pages. If you’ve played a few games and you’re looking to
become a better player, check out Part II and Part III. Experienced players will
want to look at Part III for insights into the nuances of the game. And those of
you who like to be Dungeon Masters (or who aspire to this position) should
dive into Part IV. Both longtime players and those new to the world of DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS should find something fun and interesting in the Part of Tens.

Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

Much of this book is written with the assumption that you have a D&D
Player’s Handbook. We don’t replace the D&D game rules; instead, we try to
make them clearer and help you navigate your way through them with inside
tips and advice. In addition, you’ll need a set of dice (see Chapter 1 for
details) to use the practice sessions presented in later chapters, as well as
the battle grid dungeon and character and monster markers included in this
book. The battle grid, covered with one-inch squares, when used with the
markers, helps show where your character is in relation to other characters
and monsters in any particular encounter. We discuss how to use the battle
grid in greater depth in Chapter 8.
D&D Terminology
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS has its own lexicon, just like a lot of other intensive activ-
ities. Throughout this book, we work to explain things in plain language and
to demystify some of the arcane terms and jargon used in the game and rule-
books. Whenever you need some help, flip to the glossary. The glossary is
your friend. Still, you should become familiar with the following key terms
right off the bat:
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: The original roleplaying game of medieval fantasy
and adventure. In the game, you take on the role of an imaginary charac-
ter defined by a series of statistics, cool powers, and magical abilities. The
game is played around a table or other comfortable location where books
and papers can be spread out and dice can be rolled. D&D (the short form
of the name) is a game of your imagination, part group storytelling and
part wargame. There are no winners or losers in this game; the point is to
build an exciting fantasy story through the actions of your character and
the challenges set by the Dungeon Master.
 Dungeon Master: One player is the Dungeon Master (or the DM). While
other players control a single character, the DM controls all the monsters
and enemies, narrates the action, referees the game, sets up adventures,
and develops the campaign. Every D&D game needs a DM.
 Player character: The character controlled by a player is called a player
character. A player character might be a powerful fighter, a sneaky
rogue, a crafty sorcerer, or a charismatic cleric.
 Adventure: Your character is an adventurer in a fantastic world of magic
and monsters. Other characters (controlled by other players) join your
adventuring party to explore dungeons and battle amazing creatures
such as dragons and trolls. Each quest or story is called an adventure.
An adventure might last for a single session of play or stretch over the
course of several game sessions.
3
Introduction

 Campaign: The D&D game doesn’t end with a single adventure. When
the same characters continue from one adventure to another, the overall
story is called a campaign.
 Dice: D&D is a game that uses dice to resolve actions and determine other
factors where the outcome isn’t certain. The twenty-sided die is the most
important, as all major actions in the game are resolved using it. The game
also uses a four-sided die, a six-sided die, an eight-sided die, a ten-sided
die, and a twelve-sided die. We refer to these dice as d20, d4, d6, d8, d10,
and d12. Sometimes, you need to roll multiple dice of a specific shape,
such as four six-sided dice. In that case, we use this notation: 4d6. This
allows you to generate a result between 4 and 24. Sometimes you need to
roll multiple dice and add a modifier, such as two four-sided dice plus two.
In that case, we use this notation: 2d4+2. This allows you to generate a
result between 4 and 10. (See Chapter 1 for more about D&D dice.)
 Player’s Handbook: One of the three books that make up the rules of
the D&D game. This volume contains the basic rules of play and charac-
ter creation. No D&D player should be caught without one.
 Dungeon Master’s Guide: The second of the three books that make up
the rules of the D&D game. This volume contains information that every
Dungeon Master needs to run the game, set up adventures, and build
campaigns.
 Monster Manual: The third of the three books that make up the rules of
the D&D game. This volume is packed with monsters to challenge even
the toughest D&D heroes, and contains information that every player
and DM needs to know.
How This Book Is Organized
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies consists of five parts. The chapters within
each part cover specific topics in detail. In each chapter, we start with the
basics and build from there. Whenever a point needs further clarification, we
cross-reference the appropriate chapter so you can immediately find any
additional information you need. In addition, whenever it comes up, we refer
you to the appropriate chapter in the D&D Player’s Handbook or, if necessary,
one of the other two books that make up the core rules of the game: the
Dungeon Master’s Guide or the Monster Manual.
Part I: D&D Crash Course
This is your character and these are the dice you roll. We start out with a basic
overview of the D&D game, assuming that you’re a brand new player who’s
looking to join an existing gaming group. We give you a little history on how 
the game began and how it developed, and provide you with ready-to-play
4
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

characters (called pregenerated characters) so you can join a game right now.
We finish off this section with a discussion on starting your own game, just in
case you don’t currently know anyone who plays.
Part II: Building a D&D Character
Using a pregenerated character is fine, but eventually you’ll want to build a
character of your very own. In this part, we explain the fine points of character
creation and go behind the scenes to discuss character advancement. After all,
where your character ends up might be more important than where he or she
started. This part of the book is for the player who wants to become more
invested in the D&D game. We help you navigate the Player’s Handbook so that
you can make solid, informed decisions about what kind of character you want
to build and play.
Part III: Playing Your Best Game
Even expert players should find something new and informative in this part
of the book. From effective combat tactics to powerful character combina-
tions, the basics of adventuring party teamwork to advice on good roleplay-
ing, we offer insights into the mechanics of the game and how to be the best
D&D player you can be.
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering
The rest of the book spends a lot of time offering advice and tactics to players.
Here’s where we provide tips and tricks for that select and important individ-
ual who makes every D&D game come alive — the Dungeon Master. It’s good
to be the DM, and this section of the book starts with the basics of DMing and
builds to provide insights that should give even experienced DMs something
to think about when running their own games.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without this section of top-ten lists.
Helpful and interesting collections of the best spells, monsters, and resources
abound throughout these short chapters.
After the last Part of Tens chapter and before the index is the glossary.
Perhaps the most often referred to part of this book, the glossary helps you
navigate and understand the terms and jargon that pervade the D&D game.
Use the glossary often as you use this book and the core D&D rulebooks.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
To guide you along the way and to point out information you really need to
know, this book uses the following icons.
This icon points to tips and tricks that make some aspect of the D&D game
easier or faster.
Remember these important nuggets, and you’ll be a better player or DM.
If you see this icon, read and follow the accompanying directions. This infor-
mation can prevent you (or your character) from having a very bad day.
Whenever you see this icon, you know we’re directing you to more detailed
information in one of the D&D core rulebooks — the Player’s Handbook,
Dungeon Master’s Guide, or Monster Manual.
Where Do I Go from Here?
If you’re a new player, get a copy of the D&D Player’s Handbook. If you aspire
to be a Dungeon Master, you’ll also need the Dungeon Master’s Guide and the
Monster Manual. But don’t read them yet! The core rulebooks aren’t written
for novices. Start by digging into the chapters in Part I of this book. We wrote
that part specifically to help new players enter the D&D game.
If you’ve played a time or two (or a hundred!), check out Parts II, III, and IV
for D&D gaming advice that anyone interested in the game can use. Part IV is
especially relevant if you want to be the Dungeon Master or if you want to
improve your already formidable DMing skills.
Our last bit of advice before you move on (and read all of the other nuggets of
advice we’ve packed between these yellow covers) is this: Have fun! D&D is a
game. The basics of D&D are straightforward and relatively easy to grasp.
Don’t let all the details beyond that frighten or confuse you. We’re here to help
with that, so trust us and let us do our job. For the majority of D&D players
around the world, those added details are what make D&D one of the greatest
ways they know for spending their leisure time. Explore those details with us,
and we think you’ll come to the same conclusion.

In This Chapter
 Exploring the origins and objectives of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS

E
veryone played make-believe during childhood. Whether you played
cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, superheroes, or firefighters, you
opened up your imagination and pretended to be something other than your-
self. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a game of the imagination, a roleplaying game
where players take on the roles of amazing heroes in a medieval fantasy set-
ting. It’s just like make-believe, only more sophisticated, grown up, and fun.
D&D gives form and structure to your imagination, creating a leisure activity
that’s more interactive and open-ended than any movie, novel, or computer
game.
The backdrop for D&D is a mythological world of fairy tales, epic adventures,
and monsters, where heroes gain power and magic to win against all kinds of
challenges and villains. This backdrop owes much to fantasy novels, including
The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, but also to a sort of collective
consciousness consisting of material from comic books, TV shows, movies,
and other fantasy-related influences. Over the course of 30 years, D&D has, in
turn, influenced such media and helped set the stage for the computer game
industry. This chapter provides an overview of the game and explores some of
the topics that we discuss in greater detail throughout the book.
What Is D&D?
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game is full of fantastic locations,
strange creatures, magic items, treasure, and lots of monsters. Imagine an
ancient place and time. Imagine a world much like our own, long ago, when
armored warriors used swords and bows, castles sat atop wooded hills, and

thatched cottages clumped together here and there across the countryside.
Imagine that in this ancient time magic really works, and that humans aren’t
the only intelligent species roaming the land. 
D&D lets you explore this imaginary world. With the game, some willing
friends, and your imagination, you strike out on epic quests set in this long-
ago place that never existed but is as familiar as your own recollections. The
D&D game lets you participate in the ultimate interactive story. In this story,
you and the other players determine what happens next. How does the
adventure end? That’s the best part — the ending isn’t determined until you
and your character get there!
10
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
The origin of D&D
It started with wargames, a popular pastime in
which participants re-create famous battles on
a tabletop using metal figures. In the mid-1960s,
Gary Gygax formed a small group of wargamers
who met regularly and set out to publish new
wargames. This led to the development of the
Chainmail miniatures rules, and by 1971, Gygax
added supplemental rules that expanded the
game to include fantastic creatures such as
elves, dwarves, and monsters. 
In 1972, Dave Arneson came to Gygax with a new
take on the traditional wargame. Gone were the
massive armies. Each player had a single char-
acter, like the “hero” characters in Chainmail. 
A storyteller ran the game, unfolding a narrative
in which the players were free to choose their
own course of action for their characters. This
was a cooperative experience, not a competitive
wargame, in which the players joined forces to
defeat villains and gain rewards.
This combination of miniatures gaming and
player imagination created a totally new expe-
rience. Gygax and Arneson collaborated on a
set of rules, but they weren’t able to find a pub-
lisher. So in 1974, Gygax formed a company that
eventually was called TSR, Inc. and published
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS himself. 
In 1977, the rules were totally rewritten and the
original DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Basic Set was
released. Sales rose rapidly and the game
became a phenomenon. A year later, a new 
version of the game, Advanced DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS, was introduced, published in a series
of high-quality hardcover books.
The 1980s continued to see remarkable growth
for the game, and new initiatives started during
this decade. D&D novels were introduced, a car-
toon series debuted on Saturday morning TV, and
new fantasy worlds (called campaign settings)
for D&D such as DRAGONLANCE and FORGOTTEN
REALMS appeared. In 1989, the second edition of
AD&D hit the shelves, and the 1990s saw the
birth of even more campaign settings, including
RAVENLOFT, DARK SUN, and PLANESCAPE.
In 1997, TSR changed hands. Wizards of the
Coast, makers of the phenomenal trading card
game MAGIC: THE GATHERING, purchased the com-
pany and moved most of the creative staff to its
offices in Washington state. In 2000, the newest
edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game was
released, and today the game is more popular
than ever. Some 4 million people play D&D every
month, using their imaginations and having fun
with their friends. 

For a number of reasons, D&D is different from other games you may have
played:
 The play keeps on going: Like an ongoing television series, your game
continues from play session to play session.
 Your character grows as the game goes on: You play a character that
grows and develops with every adventure he or she participates in.
 The only limit is your imagination: The game offers endless possibilities
and a multitude of choices because your character can do whatever you
can imagine.
 Everyone wins: Because the game is really a series of stories told collec-
tively by the players and the Dungeon Master, D&D is a game where
everyone wins. If your character survives and wins the day (or dies
spectacularly and memorably), and everyone has a good time, then the
adventure ends in a win for the group.
Objectives of the D&D Game
D&D is a cooperative game, not a competitive one. In other words, you don’t
compete against the other players and you don’t win by beating them. Instead,
there are a lot of different ways to “win” the game. The common denominator
in every victory condition is “fun.” If you and the other players have fun, every-
one wins a game of D&D.
Storytelling
One way to “win” a D&D game is to help the group tell a fun and exciting
story. Whether you successfully complete your adventure or fail miserably, if
everyone has a good time and you contribute to creating a story that every-
one is going to remember, the group wins.

Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure
D&D: It’s good for you
A few times over the long history of the DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS game, some people have tried to
knock it as something silly or even harmful.
Nothing could be further from the truth. D&D pro-
motes teamwork and socialization. It teaches
math and reading skills. It encourages creativity
and imaginative problem solving. It’s uplifting,
inspirational, and thought provoking. And it’s fun,
too! You sit in the same room with other people,
socialize, and create amazingly deep fantasy
worlds in which good battles evil on a regular
basis — and good usually wins out in the end.
What could be better than that?

Adventure goals
Every adventure contains its own set of victory conditions. Sometimes it’s as
simple as surviving the dungeon and escaping, or defeating the boss villain at
the heart of the fortress of evil. Other times, you might have a specific goal to
accomplish (take the evil ring and toss it in the volcano) or a specific monster
to beat (stop the werewolf before it rampages through the town again). If you
achieve the objective of the adventure, the group wins.
Character victories
When you begin playing D&D, your character starts out at 1st level — the
lowest experience level. Your character wins each time he or she defeats
monsters and gains experience points and treasure. With each new level your
character gains, he or she increases in power and reputation. Each increase
in wealth, power, and equipment is a win for your character.
Looking at the Components of the Game
You need three distinct components to play a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game: 
 Players: You need players, usually two to six of them, to take on the
roles of adventurers in the fantasy world. The adventurers controlled by
the players are also called heroes or player characters (PCs, for short).
 A Dungeon Master: The Dungeon Master (DM) controls all of the non-
player characters (NPCs) — the monsters, villains, and other incidental
characters that inhabit the fantasy world. The DM sets the pace of the
story and referees the action as the adventure unfolds.
12
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
A continuing saga . . .
Unlike other games, each D&D adventure that
you play is just one tale in the continuing saga of
your player character and the other characters
in your group. Of course, you can play a single
game session and have a great time, but the
real excitement and power of the D&D game
comes from watching your character improve
and develop from one adventure to the next.
This means that events have consequences. If
you find a magic weapon or a potion in one
adventure, for example, you can use it in the
next. And that evil necromancer that got away?
Watch out! He will return in a future adventure
to cause you more trouble, just like characters
in novels, TV series, and movies.

 An adventure: An adventure is the activity that the player characters par-
ticipate in. An adventure usually consists of a basic plot and a number 
of encounters. As the players (through their characters) interact with the
plot and resolve the encounters, they help the DM tell a story. The cool
thing is that every action the player characters perform affects the twists
and turns of the plot, so that the outcome of the adventure winds up 
surprising everyone.
The following sections give more details about all the various parts of the
D&D experience.
Players and characters
Like the protagonists of a novel or the heroes of a movie, the action revolves
around the characters in a D&D game. Each player creates a character (or
selects a ready-to-play character, such as the ones presented in Chapters 3, 4,
5, and 6), a heroic adventurer who is part of a team that regularly delves into
dungeons and battles monsters. These characters include mighty fighters,
brave clerics, cunning rogues, and powerful sorcerers. You, as a player, play
the game while your character takes all the risks.
Playing a D&D character is kind of like acting, except everything happens
around the gaming table. You don’t have to deliver lines or perform stunts.
Just find a comfortable seat, explain what your character is doing, and roll
some dice. The scene plays out in your imagination and in the imaginations
of the other players.
The Dungeon Master
One player has a special role in a D&D game. This player, the Dungeon Master
(or DM), controls the pace of the story and referees the action along the 
way. Every D&D game needs a Dungeon Master — you can’t play the game
without one.
The cool thing about Dungeon Masters is that they allow the game to be
totally interactive and open-ended. Players can have their characters attempt
anything they can imagine because there’s a real, live person sitting in the
DM’s chair, coordinating the action and determining how every event adds to
the story. The game rules and the dice help, but the DM must use his or her
imagination to make the world unfold.
The player who decides to take on the role of the Dungeon Master becomes a
member of a select group. Not everyone has the dedication and creativity to be
a DM, but those that do have a great outlet in the D&D game. The DM defines
the game his or her group is going to play, and a good DM results in a great
game of D&D.
13
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

Some groups use multiple DMs, so that everyone gets to run a player charac-
ter at some point, and everyone who wants to try their hands at DMing gets
the opportunity. Other groups go for years with the same player serving as
DM for every game session. It all depends on the desires of the group and the
personalities involved.
The adventure
The player characters are the stars of your D&D game, just like the heroes in
books or movies. They are adventurers, and adventurers need adventures. A
D&D adventure features action, combat, mystery, challenges, and lots and
lots of monsters. Adventures come in three forms: full-length adventures 
published specifically for D&D, adventure hooks in published products that
DMs can turn into full-length adventures, and adventures that DMs create for
themselves.
Adventures can be as simple as a basic dungeon crawl or as complex as a
murder mystery. An adventure can last for a single game session or stretch
out over a number of sessions of play. One adventure might take place in a
haunted castle, another in a crime-ridden village, a third in the catacombs
beneath an ancient graveyard. What makes D&D different from your typical
board game is that each adventure is just a single tale in the continuing saga
of your player characters. Adventures provide the stage upon which your
player characters perform heroic deeds and resolve legendary quests.
Anything is possible in a D&D game, and it is through adventures that the
possibilities come alive.
Supplies you need
Players and characters, a Dungeon Master, and an adventure — these are the
basic components of any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. However, you need a 
few supplies to get the most out of the experience. These things include:
 The D&D game itself
 Special dice
 Character sheets
 Miniatures and battle grids
 Pencils and paper — lots of it
14
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

The D&D game
This For Dummies book is a great place to start, but eventually you’ll need
other products and books to get the most from the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS role-
playing game. Beginners should pick up the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Basic Game,
which includes the basic rules, dice, and many of the other components dis-
cussed in this section, all in one convenient box. 
If you want to progress beyond the basics, you’ll need the three core books,
all published by Wizards of the Coast, that comprise the full D&D game: 
 Player’s Handbook: Presents the rules of the game from the player’s
point of view and provides details on creating characters, outfitting
adventurers, and playing the game.
 Dungeon Master’s Guide: Presents the rules of the game from the
Dungeon Master’s point of view and provides detailed advice on running
games, creating adventures, sustaining campaigns, and awarding experi-
ence to player characters. It also contains a selection of magic items and
a fold-out battle grid to enhance play.
 Monster Manual: Presents hundreds of creatures to use in any D&D
game. From low-level to high-level, friendly to hostile, each creature has
an illustration, game tactics, and statistics for ease of use.
The DM needs all three books, but players can usually get by with just a copy
of the Player’s Handbook.
Dice
Dice are used to determine the outcome of actions in the game. If you want
your character to try something — such as attack the ogre, disarm the trap,
or search for clues — the dice are used whenever the result isn’t a sure thing.
The D&D game uses dice of different shapes. Each player should have his or
her own set of dice with which to play the game. Players get possessive and
protective of their dice, and having your own set means you can customize it
(dice come in all kinds of styles and colors). Game play also proceeds more
smoothly when you don’t have to pass the dice around when sharing among
players.
A set of dice for the D&D game includes at least the following (see Figure 1-1): 
 One four-sided die (referred to as a d4)
 Four six-sided dice (d6)
15
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

 One eight-sided die (d8)
 Two ten-sided dice (d10) 
When these two dice are rolled together, they can produce any digit
between 01 and 100. For this reason, these two dice are often called 
percentile dice (d%). Some dice sets include a d90 (a die that has sides
expressed in tens — 10, 20, 30, and so on) to make rolling percentile
dice easier.
 One twelve-sided die (d12)
 One twenty-sided die (d20)
Figure 1-1: The basic dice for D&D.
The d20 determines character success at any given action, while the other
dice determine what happens if an action succeeds.
Character sheets
Your D&D character is defined by a series of key statistics, as well as by the
background story you create for the character. These statistics and other key
information are contained on a character sheet. As your character participates
in adventures, these statistics change. 
This book contains a series of basic character sheets that provide ready-to-
play characters. These can be found in Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Miniatures and a battle grid
While most of the action of D&D occurs in the imaginations of the partici-
pants, it is often very helpful to display certain information where everyone
can see it. Combat situations, for example, work better when the players and
DM know where all the participants are (characters and monsters) in relation
to one another. D&D uses a one-inch grid, called the battle grid, to represent
where the action takes place. To represent the characters and monsters, the
players and DM place miniatures or other markers on the battle grid.
This book contains a sample battle grid and markers to use in your first few
D&D experiences. We discuss the use of these items in Chapter 8.

Other play surfaces can be found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and the D&D
Basic Game. Official prepainted plastic D&D miniatures can be found in the
D&D Basic Game, as well as in D&D Miniatures booster packs, available wher-
ever fine hobby games are sold.
Pencils, paper, and graph paper
You’ll want a means for keeping notes and recording important information
during game play, so have a lot of pencils, scrap paper, and graph paper 
available. Use the scrap paper for notes about the adventure (write down the
names of NPCs and places, any treasure your character acquires, and any other
details that you might forget or think may be important later). One player
might take the role of note keeper, or each player may want to take his or her
own notes. Use the graph paper to sketch a map of the area the PCs are explor-
ing — players want to map the dungeon as they explore it, while the DM uses
graph paper to design the whole dungeon before the adventurers enter it.
One Game Rule to Rule Them All
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is built around a core mechanic. This core
mechanic is used to resolve all actions in the game, keeping play fast and
intuitive.
The Core Game Mechanic: Whenever your character attempts an action that
has a chance of failure associated with it, roll a twenty-sided die (d20). The
higher the roll, the better the character’s chances of succeeding in that action.
Character actions boil down to three basic types: 
 Attack rolls: A roll to determine if your character succeeds at attacking
a monster or other opponent. Using a longsword against a monster, for
example, requires an attack roll.
 Skill checks: A roll to determine if your character uses a skill successfully.
Using the Climb skill to scale a wall, for example, requires a skill check.
 Ability checks: A roll to determine if your character succeeds at attempt-
ing to do something to which no specific skill really applies. Attempting to
bash open a dungeon door, for example, requires a Strength ability check.
To determine if any of these actions are successful, follow these steps:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add any relevant modifiers.
3. Compare the result to a target number. 
17
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

If the result equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds. A
result less than the target number indicates that the action fails. Target num-
bers, also called the Difficulty Class (or DC) for a particular task or action,
come from a variety of places. Some are set by the action itself and are
defined in the rules, while other times, the target numbers are determined by
the Dungeon Master. For more details, see Chapter 7.
18
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
Expressions of D&D
The primary expression of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
takes the form of the D&D roleplaying game
(RPG). This is where the whole thing started, and
the RPG is still going strong after 30 years. This
expression is presented in the three core rule-
books (Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s
Guide, and Monster Manual) and a plethora of
supplements and accessories that expand the
world of D&D. This For Dummies book focuses on
the RPG experience and tries to make it clearer
and easier to get into. But other expressions of
D&D exist. Here are a few that you might want to
check out:
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS miniatures: Official
D&D prepainted plastic miniatures are avail-
able for use with the RPG. From hero char-
acters to monsters such as bugbears, mind
flayers, beholders, and more, a wide selec-
tion of the most popular and iconic D&D
creatures can be found in randomly assorted
booster packs. These miniature figures can
also be used for a more competitive experi-
ence, a head-to-head skirmish game where
players create warbands of D&D characters
and creatures to throw against each other. 
If this concept (which goes back to D&D’s
roots) interests you, look for the D&D
Miniatures Starter Set and Booster Packs.
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels: Wizards of 
the Coast publishes fantasy novels set in the
worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Some of 
the most popular series include novels set 
in the FORGOTTEN REALMS and DRAGONLANCE
campaigns, and the young adult KNIGHTS OF
THE SILVER DRAGON series for younger readers. 
 Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Magazine:
Paizo Publishing, in cooperation with
Wizards of the Coast, publishes two monthly
magazines dedicated to the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. Dragon Magazine provides a
player’s perspective on the hobby, offering
loads of new options to add to your game.
Consider it to be a monthly supplement full of
new feats, spells, and magic items, as well
as new player character races and prestige
classes, and tons of roleplaying and tactical
advice to make any player better at the
game. The companion periodical, Dungeon
Magazine, is the definitive monthly resource
for D&D Dungeon Masters. It features DM
advice, dungeon lairs, and ready-to-play
adventures that can be dropped into any
D&D campaign. Together, these magazines
are a must-have for serious D&D players and
DMs everywhere. You can learn more about
these magazines and find subscription infor-
mation on the Web at www.paizo.com.
 Computer and console games: You might be
more familiar with DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
through the computer and video games that
have been released over the years. The
computer game industry grew out of the
paper RPGs created by D&D, and today Atari
continues to publish licensed games set in
the worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Popular
titles include Baldur’s Gate, Neverwinter
Nights, and Temple of Elemental Evil, and
more games for both console platforms and
computers are on the way.

Joining a D&D Game
The best way to learn how to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is to jump right in. If
you know other players who have a regular game, this book provides you with
everything you need to join an existing game. The ready-to-play characters in
Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 1st-level characters, completely built and outfitted
for their first adventure. If you want to join a higher-level game, Chapter 9 pre-
sents one of these characters at greater levels of experience — specifically, at
4th level and at 8th level — giving you a little more latitude in where to start.
If you don’t have an existing game group to join, you’ll have to start your
own. Chapter 9 discusses organizing your own game group.
Whether you join an existing group or start your own, we urge you to get
moving. Every day you wait means one less day of getting in on the fun and
excitement of D&D.

Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure
The best place to start
Other than this nifty For Dummies book, where’s
the best place to start learning the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game? Well, we wrote this book to be
a great starting point as well as a perfect com-
panion to the full D&D game. Don’t be afraid to
just start out using the material in this book.
At some point, however, you need to get one of
the D&D games. If you’re brand new to the con-
cept of roleplaying games, we urge you to buy
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Basic Game. This jam-
packed box includes dice, versatile battle grid
tiles, miniatures, and ready-to-play characters.
This For Dummies book makes a great compan-
ion for learning to play with the Basic Game.
If you have some knowledge and experience with
D&D or games like it, you might be ready to leap
right into the core rulebooks. This trinity of knowl-
edge comes in the form of the Player’s Handbook,
Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual.
These volumes are available at fine hobby game
stores and bookstores, and with this For
Dummies book at your side, you should have no
trouble navigating your way through them. If you
go this route, you’ll need to buy a set of dice too,
because the books don’t come with them.
If you’d rather approach the D&D experience
through a more competitive expression, check
out the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Miniatures Starter
Set. It includes dice and rules for building war-
bands full of D&D creatures and heroes, and
presents a straight-forward version of D&D’s
core game mechanic. The great thing about
D&D is that if you understand the basics, you
can play either a competitive skirmish game or
a cooperative roleplaying adventure.

Chapter 2
Your First Character
In This Chapter
 Examining the D&D player character
 Playing a character
 Selecting the type of character you want to play
Your interface with the fantastic adventures of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is your
player character (also called a PC). Like the hero of a novel, the star of a
movie, or the character in a computer game, your player character (along
with the other player characters in your adventuring party, run by other play-
ers) is at the center of all the action. Unlike the heroes of novels, movies, or
even computer games, however, a D&D player character has no script to
follow. You determine the course of every adventure through the actions you
have your character take — and the only limit is your own imagination.
In this chapter, we examine the basics of what makes a D&D player character
tick. From game statistics to race and class abilities, this chapter provides an
overview so that you can get a handle on the character you’re going to play.
This is all in preparation for selecting one of the ready-to-play characters pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 6. In those chapters, we’ve done all the work of
creating characters so that you can spend time getting familiar with all of the
game concepts. Later in the book, we walk you through the process of char-
acter creation so that you can use this book and the core D&D rulebooks to
make your very own player character from scratch.
Defining Your Character
A DUNGEONS & DRAGONS player character lives in an ancient time, in a world
much like ours was in medieval times, when knights and castles filled the
land. Imagine this place, where magic really works and dragons roam in the
dark beyond the firelight. Your character might be a strong fighter or a
nimble rogue, a wise cleric or a charismatic sorcerer. Every day, your charac-
ter explores the unknown places of the world, seeking monsters to slay and
treasure to win. Every adventure that your character survives makes him or
her a little more powerful, a little more famous, and a little richer.

D&D is a game, and so you need some way to express and describe your
character in the context of the game world. Your fighter, for example, might
be “extremely strong but not too bright,” and those characteristics need to
be translated into game terms. The following sections provide an overview
of the things you’ll find on your character sheet, a record of your character’s
game statistics.
Name
Every great character has a great name. You may have a name all picked out
from the moment you conceive your character, or you may figure it out after
you’ve determined all of your character’s game statistics. Great names are evoca-
tive. They fit the mood of the story and world in which the character adventures.
John Savage is a great name for a character in a spy thriller set in the modern
world, but it doesn’t work so well for a character in a D&D fantasy world.
The characters presented for your use in Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 have names
already assigned to them. Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook also lists sample
names based on race. Those are good places to start when you decide to
create your own character from scratch (which we discuss in Part II).
Race
In the fantasy world of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, humans aren’t the only intelligent
race walking around. Other intelligent races share their adventures, and your
character can belong to any of these. To start, we present only a few of the
possible races you could choose from. The D&D Player’s Handbook has addi-
tional races that make great player characters.
These races are drawn from myth and legend, and they are similar to the
imaginary races that populate many popular fantasy worlds. For D&D, the
races we begin with are humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. More detailed
information on the character races can be found in Chapter 13. Here’s a quick
rundown on the benefits of each:
 Humans: These are people just like you and us. They are adaptable, flex-
ible, and extremely ambitious. Compared to the other races, humans are
relatively short-lived. In game terms, humans get an extra feat and four
extra skill points to reflect their natural tendencies.
 Dwarves: The members of this race are hearty and steadfast, standing
about 41⁄2 feet tall but powerfully built and extremely broad. They have
a strong connection to mountains and rocky places. They can live to
be more than 400 years old. In game terms, dwarves receive a +2 to
Constitution and a –2 to Charisma (see the “Ability scores” section, later
in this chapter). They also receive bonuses against poison, spells, and
22
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

magical effects. Dwarves also have darkvision, the ability to see up to
60 feet in the dark.
 Elves: Elves have a strong connection to the natural world, especially
woodlands. They can live to be more than 700 years old. Known for
being artists of both song and magic, elves have an affinity for spellcast-
ing and lore. They stand about 51⁄2 feet tall, appearing graceful and frail.
Elves receive a +2 to Dexterity and a –2 to Constitution (see the “Ability
scores” section). They are immune to sleep effects and receive a bonus
against enchantment spells. Elves have low-light vision and a racial
bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks (see the “Skills” section, later
in this chapter).
 Halflings: The members of this race are clever and capable — much more
so than their small size might indicate. Standing about 3 feet tall, with slim,
muscular builds, halflings are athletic and outgoing. Curious to a fault and
usually with a daring to match, halflings love to explore. They tend to live
well past 100. Halflings receive a +2 Dexterity and a –2 Strength to reflect
their small statures. They also receive bonuses to Climb, Jump, Listen,
and Move Silently checks (see the “Skills” section), as well as a bonus to
all saving throws due to their fearlessness and ability to avoid damage.
Class
In addition to your character’s name (Regdar, perhaps) and race (human, for
example), your character is most easily identified by his or her class. A class
is kind of like a profession or vocation. It determines what role the character
plays in the adventuring party. In this book, we present four of the most popu-
lar D&D classes for your use. More can be found in the D&D Player’s Handbook.
The four basic classes are fighter, rogue, sorcerer, and cleric. More detailed
information on the character classes can be found in Chapter 11. Here’s a
quick overview of each class:
 Fighters: These characters are warriors with exceptional combat capa-
bilities and weapon skills. Nobody kills monsters and stands at the front
of an adventuring party as well as the fighter.
 Rogues: Members of this class rely on tricks, cunning, and stealth to get
through a dungeon and save the day. Rogues are great at getting past
locked doors, scouting, spying, and attacking from the shadows.
 Sorcerers: These are spellcasters, calling on powerful magic spells to
fight monsters and protect their teammates. Sorcerers need to stay out
of direct combat, but the power they bring to the adventure makes them
worthy members of any party.
 Clerics: These characters focus the might of divine magic to cast healing
and protective spells. A good second-line warrior as well, a cleric might
be one of the most versatile members of an adventuring party.
23
Chapter 2: Your First Character

So, your character might be Regdar the human fighter, for example.
Level and XP
Level is a description of your character’s relative degree of power. A 10th-
level character, for example, is more powerful and able to take on tougher
challenges than a 5th-level character. With each new level your character
attains, he or she becomes more powerful and capable. Your character
begins play at 1st level.
Experience points (XP) are the numerical measure of your character’s per-
sonal achievements. Your character earns experience points by defeating
opponents and overcoming challenges. When your character’s XP total
reaches various milestones, he or she gains new levels. At 0 XP, for example,
your character is 1st level. At 1,000 XP, your character attains 2nd level. More
information on XP and levels can be found in Chapter 18.
Ability scores
The primary expression of your character in game terms starts with his or 
her ability scores. Every D&D character is defined by six abilities — Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. (See Chapter 12
for more information about ability scores.) Each ability gets a score, a number
that determines how good your character will be at different tasks in the game.
The average score for everyday people in a D&D world is 10 or 11. Player
characters are heroes, and so they are better than everyday folk. The average
ability score for a player character is 12 or 13.
During character creation, you can generate numbers between 3 (a terrible
score) and 18 (an excellent score). The characters presented for your use in
Chapters 3 through 6 already have their ability scores and other statistics 
figured out, so you can start playing immediately. 
Special abilities
If it hasn’t been made clear yet, your player character is special. He or she
stands above the normal people and becomes a hero in the world. As such,
your character has special abilities. These might be based on your character’s
class or race, or tied to certain feats you have selected.
For example, Regdar the fighter has taken the Power Attack feat. This pro-
vides him with the special ability to reduce the effectiveness of his attack roll
in order to increase the damage he deals on a successful hit. Another exam-
ple of a special ability is Wellyn the sorcerer’s ability to cast arcane spells.

Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Key statistics
Your character has a number of key statistics that you’ll refer to over and
over through the course of play. These appear right at the top of the ready-to-
play character sheets presented in Chapters 3 through 6. More details on
how to use these statistics can be found in Chapter 7. Here’s a quick rundown
on these statistics:
 Initiative modifier: This modifier is used to determine who goes first in
a combat round.
 Speed: This value shows how far your character can move (measured in
feet) in a round.
 Attack and damage modifiers: These numbers are associated with your
character’s weapons of choice, show what you must roll to attack oppo-
nents, and how much damage your character does if the attack succeeds.
 Armor Class (or AC): This value is what opponents need to roll to hit
your character during combat.
 Hit points (or hp): This number defines how much damage your charac-
ter can withstand before being defeated in combat. When your character
runs out of hit points, he or she is defeated.
Feats
Feats provide special bonuses or capabilities for your character. Sometimes a
feat provides a totally new power for your character. Other feats improve
powers your character already has. The ready-to-play characters in Chapters
3 through 6 have already had feats selected for them. For more information
about selecting your own feats, see Chapter 14.
Skills
Skills represent the training and education your character has beyond the
combat and spellcasting inherent to his or her class. Depending on your char-
acter’s class, your character will have a greater or lesser amount of skills to
call upon. Rogues, for example, receive a large number of points with which to
buy and improve skills. Fighters, on the other hand, just don’t go in much for
studying, and therefore receive a much smaller number of skill points to use.
Skills have already been selected for the ready-to-play characters presented
in Chapters 3 through 6. Additional information on skills can be found in
Chapter 15.

Chapter 2: Your First Character

Gear
Every D&D player character must be well prepared for adventuring life. This
is reflected not only in the class, skills, and feats the character has, but in the
gear the character carries. From weapons and armor to rations, sleeping rolls
and rope, torches, flint and steel, and the backpack to carry it all in, no
adventurer goes naked into a dungeon.
Equipment has already been selected for the ready-to-play characters pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 6. Additional information on adventuring gear
can be found in Chapter 16.
Spells
Characters with a spellcasting class possess spells. In this book, the spellcast-
ing classes we cover are the sorcerer (an arcane spellcaster) and the cleric
(a divine spellcaster). The D&D Player’s Handbook presents other spellcasting
class options.
A spell is a one-time magical effect. Some spells deal damage to either a single
opponent or a group of opponents. Other spells heal adventuring companions
who have been injured in combat. There are all kinds of spells with all kinds of
different magical effects.
26
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

The sorcerer (one of the spellcasting character classes presented in this
book) casts arcane spells. Arcane spells tend to be offensive in nature. The
cleric (another spellcasting character class in this book) casts divine spells.
Divine spells tend to be helpful and defensive in nature, providing healing or
effects that improve or otherwise benefit the party.
Spells have already been selected for the ready-to-play spellcasters pre-
sented in Chapters 5 and 6. Additional information on spells can be found in
Chapter 17.
Playing Your Character
As stated earlier in this chapter, the way you interface with the D&D world is
through your player character. Your character is your eyes and ears in the
fantasy world, as well as your hands and feet. You can interact with the world
your Dungeon Master presents in any way you want through your character.
The only limit is your imagination — and sometimes how well you roll the
dice. The following sections tell you how to get the most out of your player
characters.
Taking turns
When you’re caught up in a game, it’s easy to care only about whose turn it is
during combat and other dramatic situations (such as when dealing with a
trap or obstacle). Try not to forget that there are other people playing the
game with you. When you really get into your character and the fantasy, you
might have a tendency to hog all of the DM’s attention. Resist that urge! Let
every player have a turn talking to the DM, asking questions, or describing
what his or her character wants to do. It’s only fair, and it makes the game
work much better. Besides, much of the fun is in seeing what the other play-
ers are thinking and how they’re reacting to their characters’ actions.
During combat situations, everyone makes an initiative roll to determine the
order of play. We cover initiative and game play in greater detail in Chapter 7.
Roleplaying
D&D is a roleplaying game. That means that your character is much more
than just a collection of game statistics (though those have their place). Take
those game statistics and build a personality for your character. Remember
that your character is a hero and is part of a team, but otherwise let your
imagination be your guide. What sets your character apart are the quirks and
mannerisms you bring to the role.
27
Chapter 2: Your First Character

D&D is a game. Have fun with it. You don’t have to use funny voices or accents
or anything like that. Just determine how your character would act in any given
situation and remain true to the character as the adventure unfolds. Soon, your
character will develop a personality all of his or her own, and the game, in turn,
will take on a fantastic life that makes each session fun to play.
Your imagination is the limit
In addition to attacking, casting spells, and using skills, characters can do all
sorts of things. The only limit to what a character can do is the player’s imag-
ination and the rulings of the Dungeon Master. Depending on the situation,
your character might bash apart a cabinet to find a secret compartment,
make a rope out of bed sheets, or try to build a trap out of spare parts in an
evil wizard’s workshop. The DM decides if an idea works or not, sometimes
calling for die rolls to help determine the outcome.
Choosing Your Character
The earlier sections in this chapter cover the basics. After you have a handle
on the basic stuff, select your own character from those presented over the
28
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
Players are not characters
Always keep in mind that you and your character
are two different people. You have knowledge as
a player that your character doesn’t have. Your
character shouldn’t know what die rolls have
been made or other things that don’t make up his
or her “character knowledge.” Characters never
talk about Armor Class or hit points or ability
scores. They can discuss the quality of their
armor, their general health, and their comparative
strengths and weaknesses, but never the game
mechanics behind those things.
Be sure to let the DM and the other players
know when you’re speaking as your character
or as yourself, if there is any confusion. When
you remember the difference between you the
player and your character, everyone can have
more fun roleplaying.
A good Dungeon Master may say during the
game “You don’t know that” or “You wouldn’t
think of that,” meaning that you’re confusing
player knowledge with character knowledge.
Good players learn to avoid this type of problem
by keeping the two separate.
Players don’t swing swords, cast spells, disarm
traps, or die fighting monsters. Characters, on
the other hand, do all this and more over the
course of a typical adventure.

next four chapters. There’s no right or wrong way to choose a character. You
might like the picture of the character and decide to play that character
because he or she looks cool and heroic. You might really want to play a spe-
cific class and/or race. Of course, you should read through all the material,
but in the end, go with your gut and choose the character that most appeals
to you. Here are some recommendations:
 Fighters: You want to play a fighter if being in the thick of combat appeals
to you. Fighters always have something to do, no matter what challenge
appears before them. Fighters are also among the easiest characters to
play because they do one thing and they do it well — they fight. If you
want to play a fighter, turn to Chapter 3 and select one of the ready-to-play
fighters presented therein.
 Rogues: You want to play a rogue if being sneaky and cunning appeals to
you. Rogues have plenty of skills to call upon, and they excel at making
sneak attacks on their enemies. Rogues have a few more options than
fighters, making them slightly more complex to play, but they’re still a
good choice for those new to the game and the concepts of D&D. If you
want to play a rogue, turn to Chapter 4 and select one of the ready-to-
play rogues presented therein.
 Sorcerers: You want to play a sorcerer if casting flashy spells appeals to
you. Sorcerers cast arcane spells that deal damage or protect the party.
Sorcerers are harder to play than fighters or rogues due to the slight
complexity of spellcasting, but the rewards for playing a sorcerer well
can be very satisfying. If you want to play a sorcerer, turn to Chapter 5
and select one of the ready-to-play sorcerers presented therein.
 Clerics: You want to play a cleric if spellcasting, up close combat, and
helping others appeals to you. Clerics cast defensive and helpful divine
spells that give the entire party a boost. In addition, they have the ability
to fight alongside fighters when the monsters charge in fast and furiously.
If you want to play a cleric, turn to Chapter 6 and select one of the ready-
to-play clerics presented therein.

Chapter 2: Your First Character
Creating your own character
We recommend starting out by using one of the
ready-to-play characters. This allows you to get
right into the game and get a feel for it without a
lot of upfront preparation. However, one of the
great joys of the D&D game is creating your own
character and watching him or her develop and
grow over the course of a long and exciting cam-
paign. When you’re ready to create your own
character from scratch, the information in Part II
guides you through the process of using the D&D
Player’s Handbook to build exactly the character
you want to play.

Chapter 3
Starting Out as a Fighter
In This Chapter
 Understanding the fighter class
 Exploring who should play a fighter
 Discovering how to play a fighter
 Meeting four ready-to-play fighters
T
he fighter is the quintessential DUNGEONS & DRAGONS player character. As
the name of the class implies, the fighter has the best all-around fighting
capabilities. A fighter usually has a good Strength score to better use melee
weapons, such as swords and axes. A good Dexterity score helps bolster a
fighter’s use of ranged weapons, such as bows, as well as his or her Armor
Class.
Fighters can use any kind of armor, shield, or most weapons without penalty.
They are trained in all types of combat.
Your character can take any approach to the fighter class. He might be a
questing knight, a king’s champion, or an elite foot soldier. She might be a
mercenary, a raider, or a thug. Some fighters use their expertise for the
greater good, while others are only interested in personal gain.
Some fighters take up the sword to escape life on the farm. Whether a fighter
receives formal training in an army or local militia, or is self-taught but battle
tested, he or she stands at the front of any adventuring party. A fighter pro-
vides combat prowess, high hit points, and good defense to the party. In
return, the fighter seeks magical support, healing, and scouting skills from
comrades. As part of a team, the fighter protects the other party members
and wades in to defeat the tough opponents. In other words, the fighter’s job
is to fight.
In this chapter, we provide a bit of advice on who might want to play a fighter
character and how to play a fighter character if that’s the route you decide to
go. The rest of the chapter features four ready-to-play fighter characters that
you can use to kick-start your adventuring career.

Who Should Play a Fighter?
The fighter is among the easiest, most straightforward characters to play.
Anyone brand new to the concept of D&D and roleplaying might want to start
out with a fighter character. If you think that being in the center of most
combat encounters will appeal to you, or if you like the idea of playing a
physically powerful character, then the fighter is the class for you.
Every adventuring party needs at least one fighter. In a party of four, a solid
fighter is essential to success. In a party of five or six, two fighters really pro-
vide a lot of offense and make adventuring that much easier.
How to Play a Fighter
The fighter does one thing and he or she does it well. Combat is the fighter’s
bread and butter, so if you play a fighter, you have to be ready to wade into
battle whenever monsters or other opponents appear. A melee-oriented fighter
(a fighter who uses close-quarter weapons such as swords) wants to get up
close and personal with the enemy, and usually wants to take on the toughest
opponent personally. A ranged fighter (a fighter who uses ranged weapons
such as bows) wants to attack opponents from a distance, at least for the first
few rounds of battle. The ranged fighter should always have at least some skill
with a melee weapon, however, because very few opponents stand around at a
distance to get shot at for very long. And when they rush in, it’s a good idea to
have a secondary weapon (say, a longsword) for defense.
Fighters should be brave and stalwart, gutsy and heroic. Later, you can
play with the baselines and portray any kind of fighter you want, but to start
out, go with the tried-and-true basics. Fighters live for the thrill of combat
and the excitement of adventure. And woe to any evil that happens to cross
their path!
Have fun with the idea of being a physical powerhouse, a combat expert,
and a master of weapons. That’s the fighter’s portfolio, and you should play
it for all it’s worth. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t play smart, however.
If your fighter blindly rushes into combat and gets killed, then the rest of
your team will be in real trouble. Be cautious, but not too cautious. Above
all, be a hero.
32
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Selecting a Fighter
The rest of this chapter features four ready-to-play fighter characters:
 Regdar is a human male who excels at close combat with his powerful
greatsword.
 Brenna is a human female who also wields a greatsword.
 Tordek is a dwarf male who uses a dwarven waraxe.
 Quarion is an elf male who prefers ranged combat with his longbow,
though he carries a longsword for those times when he has to fight in
close quarters.
Any of these characters make a great fighter and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you, and then turn to
Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

Chapter 3: Starting Out as a Fighter

Regdar, Human Fighter
Regdar is a champion of good, pledging his mighty sword to the cause of 
justice. He adventures to put down evil and to gain skill and experience that
he can use in his crusade. Of all the weapons he has trained to use, Regdar
prefers his greatsword, even though it requires two hands to use and thus
prevents him from using a shield to protect himself. Regdar’s job on an
adventuring team is to kill the monsters and protect his teammates.

Chapter 4
Starting Out as a Rogue
In This Chapter
 Understanding the rogue class
 Exploring who should play a rogue
 Discovering how to play a rogue
 Meeting three ready-to-play rogues
T
he rogue has been part of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS experience from the
beginning. In the early days, this class was called the thief, but as player
characters, rogues can and should be so much more than that title implies.
A rogue is an expert in the use of all kinds of skills, excelling at sneaking
around, scouting, and disarming traps. A rogue usually has a good Dexterity
score to improve his or her success with many of the class’s primary skills,
as well as to bolster his or her Armor Class and ranged attacks.
Rogues can use only light armor, simple weapons, rapiers, and shortbows.
Using heavier armor, shields, or martial weapons provides a penalty to a
rogue’s attacks and skill checks. (Certain skills, such as Open Lock and Disable
Device, require the use of thieves’ tools, which is a kit that contains tools such
as metal picks, clamps, a small saw, a small hammer, and skeleton keys.)
Your character can take any approach to the rogue class. He might be a
stealthy thief, a silver-tongued trickster, or an elite scout. She might be a spy,
a thug, or a diplomat. All rogues are versatile, adaptable, and resourceful.
Rogues adventure to get something they want. Some want information and
experience, others loot. Some rogues seek fame, others infamy. Many also see
every adventure as a challenge — figuring out how best to avoid a guard, cir-
cumvent a trap, or avoid setting off an alarm. A rogue’s role in an adventuring
party depends on the skills the character has learned. As part of a team, the
rogue looks for opportunities to make ranged attacks or to strike from hiding,
while using stealth and evasion to serve as party scout.
In this chapter, we provide a bit of advice on who might want to play a rogue
character and how to play a rogue character if that’s the route you decide to
go. The rest of the chapter features three ready-to-play rogue characters that
you can use to kick-start your adventuring career.

Who Should Play a Rogue?
The rogue isn’t as dedicated to a single mode of play as the fighter, but this
class makes a good starting point for new players who aren’t afraid of making
a few decisions during the game. If you like to solve puzzles, or if you want to
play a character that is equal parts skillful, cunning, and stealthy, then the
rogue is the class for you.
Every adventuring party needs one rogue. In a party of four, a skillful rogue is
essential to success. In a larger party, a single rogue still provides the abilities
to avoid or overcome traps and hazardous obstacles. More than one rogue
might be overkill, and you could be sacrificing other skill sets that the party
might desperately need.
How to Play a Rogue
The rogue has a number of skills and abilities that make him or her an essen-
tial part of any adventuring team. Stealth and skills are the rogue’s tools of
trade, so if you play a rogue, you have to be ready for anything. Battle isn’t
the rogue’s primary function. Instead, the rogue scouts for the party, uses
skills to deal with traps and locked doors, and usually has enough other skills
to be a jack-of-all-trades. Though a rogue’s low hit points and attack bonus
(compared to a fighter) make close-quarters battle even more dangerous for
a character of this class, a rogue does have a special sneak attack that can
deliver an amazing amount of damage on a successful hit. A rogue’s skill with
a ranged weapon usually allows him or her to help the party by attacking
opponents from a distance.
Rogues should be curious and daring. Later, you can play with the baselines
and portray any kind of rogue you want, but to start out, go with the tried-
and-true basics. You live for the thrill of adventure. You seek challenges to
overcome, and you just have to open that locked door to see what’s waiting
on the other side. And if you can pick up some gold along the way, so much
the better!
Have fun with the idea of being a skilled expert who’s dexterous and stealthy.
Use your skills and abilities often and the rewards will come to you. While all
rogues have a little bit of thief in them (or in some cases, a lot), the code of
the adventuring party urges you not to steal from your teammates. After all,
everyone in the team needs to be able to trust each other to work best, and
the rogue should work extra hard not to be the cause of strife and unrest in
the party. Be curious and a little reckless, but not too reckless. Above all, be
a hero.

Selecting a Rogue
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play rogue characters:
 Kerwyn is a human male who excels at getting into locked places and
swings a rapier with wild abandon.
 Shadow is a human female who uses stealth as a weapon and has a good
mix of useful skills.
 Lidda is a halfling female who is quick on her feet and deadly when strik-
ing from the shadows.
Any of these characters make a great rogue and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you, and then turn to
Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

Chapter 4: Starting Out as a Rogue

Kerwyn, Human Rogue
Kerwyn is a good-hearted rogue with a thirst for adventure. He sees every
quest as a challenge to do his best and help his companions — and if he
earns some gold along the way, even better. Kerwyn’s weapon of choice is the
rapier, and the blade sings in his skilled hands. Kerwyn’s job on an adventur-
ing team is to handle tricky challenges such as locked doors and traps.

Chapter 5
Starting Out as a Sorcerer
In This Chapter
 Understanding the sorcerer class
 Exploring who should play a sorcerer
 Discovering how to play a sorcerer
 Meeting three ready-to-play sorcerers
T
he sorcerer is an arcane spellcaster who uses magic for attack, defense,
and a myriad of other uses. A sorcerer approaches magic as an art, using
raw power, directed at will, to cast spells. A sorcerer requires a good Charisma
score, as this ability determines how powerful the sorcerer can ultimately
become. Good Dexterity and Constitution scores also help keep the sorcerer
alive when trouble appears.
Sorcerers are only proficient with simple weapons. Armor interferes with
spellcasting, so sorcerers usually avoid it.
Your character can take any approach to the sorcerer class. Most sorcerers
believe that their power comes from within themselves, and many believe
that the source of that power comes from dragon ancestors whose blood
courses through them. Whatever the truth, sorcerers tend to be proud, confi-
dent, and introspective.
Sorcerers adventure to improve their abilities. Their spellcasting ability
comes from within themselves, and it can only be honed and developed
through use. A sorcerer’s role in an adventuring party depends on the spells
the character has learned. As part of a team, the sorcerer uses his or her
powerful presence (thanks to a high Charisma score) to negotiate and bar-
gain on behalf of the party, all the while watching for the best opportunity to
cast a spell.

Who Should Play a Sorcerer?
Spellcasting can be tricky, but every party needs a spellcaster, and the
rewards for playing one can be high. If you want to play a character with a bit
of an exotic nature and a selection of powerful spells at the ready, then the
sorcerer is the class for you.
Every adventuring party should have a sorcerer for the magical might the
class provides. An arcane spellcaster has access to magical spells that can
complement or enhance the natural abilities of nonspellcasters such as fight-
ers and rogues. In a party of four, the sorcerer’s offensive magic can be every
bit as important as the fighter’s greatsword. To get the most out of a sorcerer
in a party of five or six, it makes sense to team up with another spellcaster,
either another sorcerer (with a different selection of spells) or a cleric.
How to Play a Sorcerer
The sorcerer is not a melee combatant. When a battle breaks out, the sor-
cerer wants to be at a distance, casting spells or using a ranged weapon. A
sorcerer can’t stand up to a lot of physical damage, and so must rely on other
team members to provide defense. What the sorcerer has is a selection of
spells that he or she can cast multiple times. A sorcerer with damage-dealing
spells can become a primary source of a party’s offensive punch. A sorcerer
with charms and illusions, on the other hand, plays a subtler role in a party’s
success.
Sorcerers should be confident and a little mysterious. They have good inter-
personal skills and often possess a presence that demands attention. As a
sorcerer, you adventure to test the limits of your power — and by testing
them, to surpass them.
Have fun playing a good-looking, exotic, mysterious spellcaster with a touch
of dragon in your blood. Cast spells at opportune times to help your party,
and then stand back and provide ranged attacks to supplement the offensive
melee capabilities of the fighter and cleric. Test yourself and your team often,
for in the test is perfection. Above all, be a hero.

Selecting a Sorcerer
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play sorcerer characters:
 Wellyn is a human male who spends a lot of time thinking but has offen-
sive spells at the ready.
 Eronni is a human female who prefers to tantalize and confuse her 
enemies, but she can deal damage when she has to.
 Valanthe is an elf female who mixes offense with defense to best serve
her team.
Any of these characters make a great sorcerer and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you, and then turn to

Chapter 6
Starting Out as a Cleric
In This Chapter
 Understanding the cleric class
 Exploring who should play a cleric
 Discovering how to play a cleric
 Meeting three ready-to-play clerics
N
o fantasy world is complete without a pantheon of mythical gods to
add flavor, color, and background to the setting. And no DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS adventuring party is complete without a servant of the gods — the
cleric. A cleric uses divine magic and decent combat abilities to aid a party. A
cleric needs a good Wisdom score to bolster his or her divine spells. A good
Constitution score improves a cleric’s hit points so he or she can wade into
battle when called upon, and a good Charisma score improves the class’s
ability to turn undead (the ability to repel or destroy undead creatures such
as skeletons and zombies).
Clerics can use any kind of armor and shield, and they can use all simple
weapons without penalty. To use weapons that fall into other categories with-
out penalty, such as martial weapons (which include longswords and warham-
mers), a cleric needs to select the appropriate feat.
Clerics adventure to support the causes of their gods, to help those in need,
and to work to improve the reputation of their deities and temples. In addi-
tion to following their faith, clerics might have any common motivation for
adventuring as well. Clerics can seek fame, treasure, and power, just like any
other class.

An adventuring cleric devotes his or her life to a god’s service from a young
age. A cleric uses divine magic to aid the party, using healing spells and
boosting spells to best advantage. Having the second-best combat skills of
the four core classes, the cleric provides melee support and often wades in to
stand beside the fighter in battle. The cleric’s job is to defend and heal with
spells, and to fight when battle rages.
Who Should Play a Cleric?
The cleric can be somewhat complex to play due to the class’s proficiency in
both combat and divine magic. However, this combination makes the cleric
not only necessary for any adventuring team, but a lot of fun to play, too. If
you think that playing a supporting role, helping your teammates, and occa-
sionally mixing it up in battle sounds like the kind of character you want to
play, then the cleric is the class for you.
Every adventuring party needs at least one cleric. In a party of four, a cleric is
essential to success. In a party of five or six, two clerics can provide a lot of
healing and defense, making adventuring that much easier.
How to Play a Cleric
In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody’s friend. Through the use of
divine magic, a cleric can make a fighter stronger or a rogue quicker for a
short period of time, for example, and everyone can benefit from a timely
healing spell in the middle of a grueling battle. Some clerics serve a cause or
an ideal instead of a god, but all clerics work to promote the source of their
divine power.
Clerics should be brave and helpful, faithful and heroic. Later, you can play
with the baselines and portray any kind of cleric you want, but to start out,
go with the tried-and-true basics. You live to help others and serve your god.
You hate evil in all its forms, and you have a special loathing for the undead.
Have fun with the idea of being the one that the rest of the party counts on
for healing and defense. Don’t be afraid to pick up your mace and mix it up
with the monsters, but that should take second place to providing divine sup-
port for the team. Be devoted to your cause and your teammates. Above all,
be a hero.

Selecting a Cleric
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play cleric characters, all of
which combine healing and defensive magic with good combat skills:
 Jerek is a human male in service to Ehlonna, the goddess of the forests.
 Tiann is a human female who follows the path of Heironeous, the god of
valor.
 Eberk is a dwarf male who is devoted to Moradin, the god of dwarves.
Any of these characters make a great cleric and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you, and then turn to
Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

A
lthough the heart of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is imagination and
adventure, and your character can attempt to do anything you can think
of, the best way to learn how to apply the game mechanics is by examining
D&D combat. So in this chapter, we show you how to play the game from the
perspective of beating up the monsters — that’s something that happens in
almost every D&D adventure.
Refer to one of the ready-to-play character sheets from Chapters 3 through 6
when reading this chapter.
Understanding the D&D Game
Every DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is an adventure. From an epic quest to a
humble dungeon crawl, an adventure breaks down into three basic types of
encounters: 
 Roleplaying encounters: These encounters present players with situations
in which they can roleplay their characters and interact with each other
and with those characters controlled by the Dungeon Master (known as
nonplayer characters, or NPCs). Trading, negotiating, or simply talking to
locals are among the types of roleplaying encounters you may participate
in. Skills like Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate are sometimes employed
during these encounters, but many times, no dice rolls are necessary at
all. Roleplaying encounters can lead to challenge or combat encounters,
or they can be self-contained discussions between characters.

 Challenge encounters: Encounters of this type revolve around charac-
ters struggling against natural or man-made hazards, such as trying to
cross a lake of fire or dealing with a poison-needle trap on a locked
chest. These encounters require skill checks, ability checks, or saving
throws to navigate.
 Combat encounters: These make up the heart of many D&D adventures.
When no other option presents itself for dealing with monsters or other
opponents (such as brigands, thugs, raiders, or pirates), the D&D charac-
ter hefts sword, staff, or axe and wades into battle. Combat encounters
are the most rigidly structured times in the game, where most of the core
rules come into play. When most people talk about playing D&D, this is
the part of the game they envision. We show you how to play the game
using the combat encounter structure throughout the rest of this chapter.
Rolling Dice
To provide tension, suspense, and an element of luck, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game uses dice to determine the outcome of actions where failure has a con-
sequence. Fighting a monster, picking a lock, disarming a trap, leaping over a
pit of molten lava — the game provides a method for determining success or
failure based on a character’s skills and abilities and adding a touch of luck
for drama and excitement. Rolling dice is fun, and D&D allows for plenty of
dice-rolling action in every adventure.
Remember the Core Game Mechanic: Whenever your character attempts an
action that has a chance of failure associated with it, roll a twenty-sided die
(d20). The higher the roll, the better the chance of success.
These character actions boil down to attack rolls, skill checks, and ability
checks. To determine if any of these actions are successful, you follow these
steps:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add any relevant modifiers.
3. Compare the result to a target number.
If the result equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds.
A result of less than the target number indicates that the action fails.
For any task or action, target numbers, also called the Difficulty Class
(or DC), come from a variety of places. Some are set by the action itself
and are defined in the rules, and others are determined by the Dungeon
Master. An opponent’s Armor Class, for example, is the target number
needed to make a successful attack.
For example, if Regdar the fighter wants to attack the fearsome bugbear with
his greatsword, his player rolls a twenty-sided die and adds 4 (his attack roll
74
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

modifier). If the result is 17 or better, his attack hits (17 is the bugbear’s Armor
Class). The player then rolls dice to determine how much damage the attack
deals to the bugbear. To find out how much damage Regdar deals with his
greatsword, Regdar’s player rolls 2d6+3 (two six-sided dice and adds 3, for a
result between 5 and 15).
Combat Basics
As characters adventure into mysterious forests or dark dungeons, they often
encounter monsters of all shapes and sizes. In the inevitable battles that ensue,
you use dice and your character’s statistics to determine the course of combat.
Players roll dice for their characters. The Dungeon Master rolls dice for the
monsters (or whatever opponents the player characters are facing).
In a combat encounter, you put miniature figures for each character and mon-
ster on a battle grid. Players take turns in order, one after the other, moving
their figures on the battle grid to show where their characters are moving in
the battle, placing the figures next to or within sight of the monsters that
their characters are attacking. (See Chapter 8 for more about using the battle
grid.) You roll a die to see if an attack hits. If it hits, you roll dice to determine
how much damage the attack deals. 
Determining who goes first
Every character and monster has an initiative modifier. This is a bonus or
penalty added to a d20 roll called an initiative check. Everyone makes an ini-
tiative check at the start of a combat encounter. This sets the order of play
for the entire encounter, as follows:
1. Players make initiative checks for their characters by making a d20
roll and adding initiative modifiers.
2. The Dungeon Master makes an initiative check for the monsters, one
roll for all opponents. If an encounter features different types of mon-
sters with different initiative modifiers, use the highest modifier when
making the check.
3. The Dungeon Master jots down all the results on scrap paper to estab-
lish an initiative order, from highest result to lowest result.
4. The character or creature with the highest initiative result goes first
and takes a turn, followed by the next highest result, and so on.
5. When everyone has had a turn, the round ends. 
The second round uses the same order, starting with the character with
the highest initiative result. Continue until the battle ends.
75
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

The DM’s initiative log for a combat encounter might look like this: 
Lidda 
25
Wellyn
17
Regdar
10
Monsters
7
Eberk
4
This indicates the order in which each character will act in each round of
the encounter. Notice that the DM makes a single roll for all of the monsters
in the encounter, and all the monsters act after Regdar but before Eberk.
(Eberk’s player rolled a poor initiative result.)
On your turn in combat, your character can do any one of the following
actions:
 Move and attack.
 Attack and move.
 Just move.
 Just attack.
Moving in combat
D&D is a game of imagination, but sometimes it gets really hard to visualize
exactly what is going on in combat situations. When your character, other
player characters, and several monsters are all attacking and moving around,
it helps to have a clear visual representation so everyone knows exactly where
each character and monster is during the battle. This is where miniature fig-
ures and the battle grid come into play. Each character and monster has its
own miniature (or some other marker to represent it). At the beginning of a
combat encounter, the players and the DM arrange the figures or markers on
the battle grid to show the positions of all of the characters and monsters.
Chapter 8 covers using the battle grid in detail.
Your character’s speed is listed on the character sheet (see Chapters 3
through 6). For simplicity, the speed is expressed in squares, showing how
many squares the character (represented by a miniature or some other
marker) can move on the battle grid. Each square on the battle grid repre-
sents an area that is 5 feet wide, so a character with a speed of 6 can move
76
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

up to 30 feet in a single round. Here are some guidelines to remember when
gauging movement:
 Speed: Your character can move up to his or her speed in squares in a
single round. Of course, your character can move less if you prefer.
 Diagonals: When your character moves diagonally on the battle grid, the
first diagonal square you move into counts as 1 square, the second diag-
onal counts as 2 squares, the third as 1 square, the fourth as 2 squares,
and so on. You can think of each diagonal square as 1.5 squares for the
purposes of moving and determining distances.
 Friends: Your character can move through a square occupied by one of
his or her teammates, but your character can’t stop in that square.
 Monsters: Your character can’t move through squares occupied by mon-
sters or other opponents. If your character moves next to a monster or
other opponent, your character must stop or the monster gets a free
attack against him or her right away. This free attack is called an attack of
opportunity. If you start your turn with your character next to a monster
(or other opponent), your character can only move one square. If your
character moves farther, the monster gets an attack of opportunity
against him or her.
 Just moving: If all you want to do on your turn is move, your character
can move up to twice his or her speed. So, if Regdar decides to just move
on his turn, he can move up to 8 squares (or 40 feet).
Attacking with a weapon
In the D&D game, the two basic ways to attack with weapons are as follows: 
 Melee attacks: These attacks require the use of a melee weapon (such as
a sword or mace), and your character must be next to an enemy to make
a melee attack. 
 Ranged attacks: Attacks of this sort require the use of a ranged weapon
(such as a shortbow or crossbow), and there must be at least 1 square
between your character and an enemy on the battle grid in order for your
character to make a ranged attack. You must be able to draw an imaginary
line between your character and the enemy target. If walls, monsters, or
another character completely blocks the path between your character’s
square and the target’s square, you can’t make a ranged attack because
your character doesn’t have a clear line of sight.
77
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

The attack and damage rolling process is as follows:
1. Decide which weapon your character is using to make the attack.
2. Roll a d20 and add the bonus or penalty listed for that weapon.
3. If the result of the roll and modifier is equal to or higher than the
monster’s Armor Class, your attack hits.
4. If the attack hits, roll the type of die indicated for the weapon’s
damage and add the listed modifier (if any).
5. Damage reduces the monster’s hit points; if the monster’s hit points
drop to 0, it’s defeated.
At higher levels, your character can make more than one attack per turn.
To do so, however, you can only attack. You can’t move and make multiple
attacks on a turn.
Damage and dying
When characters and monsters attack and hit (that is, when they achieve a
result that equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class), they deal damage to
their target. Damage reduces hit points, but has no other effect on a target.
A character or monster with 1 hit point is as strong and healthy as one with
25 hit points — except that the character or monster is closer to 0 hit points.
And 0 hit points is bad.
When a monster’s hit points are reduced to 0, it is dead and defeated.
When a character’s hit points are reduced to 0, he can take only a single move
on his turn. If he tries to do anything else, he falls to -1 hit points immediately
thereafter.
When a player character’s hit points are reduced to 1 or lower, the character
falls to the ground, unconscious but not yet dead — the character is dying.
Each round thereafter, the character loses 1 hit point. When the character’s
hit points drop to –10, he or she dies.
Healing a dying character
Each round, a dying character has a 10 percent chance of becoming stable,
meaning that the character is no longer losing hit points, but he or she is
still unconscious. To roll a percentage, you roll two ten-sided dice, indicating
before hand which is the first digit (the ten’s place) and which is the second
digit (the one’s place). (Some ten-sided dice have two numbers on each
side, from 00 to 90, to indicate that die is to be used for the ten’s place
when rolling a percentage.) For example, a result of 0 (or 00) on the first
78
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

die and 8 on the second die generates 08 percent, indicating that the charac-
ter stabilizes. 
A character with the Heal skill can stop a dying character’s loss of hit points
with a skill check result of 15 or better. This action takes the place of an attack.
Any amount of magical healing also stops a dying character’s loss of hit
points. If magical healing raises a character’s hit points to 1 or more, the
character can resume acting as normal.
What Else Can You Do During Combat?
Besides moving and attacking, a character can take these actions during a
combat round:
 Move and cast a spell, or cast a spell and move.
 Switch weapons (but not move).
 Move and reload a crossbow (but not attack).
 Reload a crossbow and attack (but not move).
 Perform another action (for example, kick open a door or pick up an
object).
Casting spells
In most cases, a cleric or sorcerer can cast a spell before or after moving.
This counts as the character’s attack for the round. At higher levels, your char-
acter will learn spells that require the whole turn to cast, but all of the spells
provided on the ready-to-play character sheets take only part of the turn.
Here are some guidelines about casting spells during combat: 
 Divine spells: Clerics cast divine spells. The ready-to-play clerics
(see Chapter 6) can cast each of their listed spells once per day. After
a period of prayer and preparation, the spells are once again available
for use. This prayer period consists of meditating for one hour in a rela-
tively peaceful environment at a specific time each day, usually dawn,
dusk, noon, or midnight. (See Chapter 17 for more about using and
preparing spells.) Clerics can also replace a prepared spell with a cure
spell. For example, Eberk can cast cure light wounds instead of his bless
spell, should he so desire. In such a case, Eberk is deciding to forego the
benefits of a bless spell for the day in favor of providing healing magic
for himself or a teammate.
79
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

 Arcane spells: Sorcerers cast arcane spells. A sorcerer can cast a certain
number of spells per day, but the spell cast must come from the charac-
ter’s selection of known spells (see Chapter 5 for the known spells of the
ready-to-play sorcerers). For example, Wellyn can cast four 1st-level spells
every day. He knows two 1st-level spells: burning hands and magic missile.
So, during a day of adventuring, Wellyn might cast two burning hands
spells and two magic missile spells, or four magic missile spells, or any
other combination that adds up to four. After a night of rest (at least 8
hours), the sorcerer’s spell slots are once again available to use. The
sorcerer concentrates for 15 minutes and readies his mind to cast his
daily allotment of spells. (See Chapter 17 for more about using and
preparing spells.)
 Monsters and opponents: If a monster or other opponent is adjacent
to a spellcaster, casting a spell provokes an immediate attack from the
monster (an attack of opportunity). Should the attack succeed, the spell-
caster must make a successful Concentration skill check (DC equals 10
plus the damage the monster deals) to cast the spell. If the skill check
fails, the spell can’t be cast this turn.
 Rolling: You don’t have to roll a die for your character to succeed at
casting a spell. As long as your character has a spell available, just say
that he or she is casting it. You might have to roll a die to see how much
damage a spell deals, or how many hit points it cures, or whatever.
Sometimes, a monster gets a saving throw to avoid some or all of a
spell’s effects.
Saving throws
Every character and monster has modifiers for the three types of saving
throws in the game (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves). A saving throw is a die
roll you make to protect your character from certain types of danger. When
you need to make a saving throw, the Dungeon Master will tell you. You don’t
choose which type of save to make; that’s determined by the nature of the
danger.
To make a saving throw, roll a twenty-sided die and add the modifier for the
particular type of save you are trying to make. The DM will tell you what a
successful roll (or a failure) indicates. Chapter 10 discusses saving throws in
more detail.
Switching weapons
At the start of a combat, your character either has a specific weapon in hand
or draws a weapon. You can have your character switch weapons during
combat (sheathing a longsword and drawing a longbow, for example), but
doing so takes the entire turn.
80
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Reloading a crossbow
Crossbows take time to reload. On a turn after your character shoots a cross-
bow, he or she can reload the weapon and shoot, or your character can move
and reload. Your character can’t do all three things — reload, shoot, and
move — in the same turn. 
Longbows and shortbows don’t require extra time to reload.
Special Combat Rules
The following sections describe a couple of special rules that may come into
play during a combat encounter.
Shooting into a fight
Some player characters have ranged weapons. They can fire these at mon-
sters as they see fit. When the monster they want to shoot is mixing it up
with another player character in close-quarters (melee) combat, it becomes
harder to accurately use a ranged weapon. To make a ranged attack against a
monster that is next to a teammate, your character gets a –4 penalty to the
attack roll because it’s hard to shoot the monster when the monster is so
close to his or her friend.
For example, Lidda wants to make an attack with her shortbow (a ranged
weapon) against the orc engaged in melee combat with Regdar. Lidda’s
player normally makes a d20+4 roll to try to attack the orc with her shortbow.
Because the monster is in melee with Regdar (her teammate), she makes the
attack with a –4 penalty. The attack roll is now d20.
Flanking
You can employ a combat tactic called flanking to get an advantage against
an opponent. If your character and a teammate’s are on opposite sides of a
monster, you each get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that monster.
For example, Lidda draws her rapier and moves to the opposite side of the
orc. Now Lidda and Regdar are flanking the monster. This provides them both
with a +2 bonus. Now Lidda’s rapier attack is d20+3 and Regdar’s greatsword
attack increases to d20+6.
81
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

Exploring the Dungeon
Outside of combat, D&D play can be very casual. The Dungeon Master tells
the players what their characters see (and hear, and smell, and so on) and
asks them what they do. Players don’t have to act in any particular order,
though the DM may impose some structure just so everyone gets to do what
they want to do. If you use the battle grid during these casual periods, it’s
probably just to see where the characters are in relation to each other. Here’s
an example of dungeon exploration:
Dungeon Master: “The 10-foot-wide corridor you’ve been following ends
in a locked wooden door. What do you want to do?”
Lidda’s player: “I try to unlock the door.”
Dungeon Master: “Okay. Make an Open Lock check.”
Lidda’s player: Rolls a d20 and adds 7 (her Open Lock modifier) to the
result. “I got a 16.”
Dungeon Master: “The lock clicks open.”
Regdar’s player: “Now that the door is unlocked, I step past Lidda and
open the door.”
Dungeon Master: “The doors swings open with a slight creak. Inside, you
see a small gold statue sitting atop a waist-high pedestal in the center of
the room.”
Lidda’s player: “I walk up and take a look.”
Valanthe’s player: “So do I.”
Eberk’s player: “I’ll stand in the doorway in case something goes 
wrong.”
Regdar’s player: “Lidda’s always getting into trouble. I’ll step into
the room but stand back, ready to move if Lidda and Valanthe set off
a trap.”
Dungeon Master: “Okay. Valanthe and Lidda look at the statue. It appears
to be made of gold. It seems heavy, even if it isn’t more than a foot and a
half tall. It’s carved in the shape of a dragon, and there is some kind of
writing near the base that you can’t read.”
Valanthe’s player: “I cast detect magic.”
Dungeon Master: “The statue glows with an aura of magic. Everyone
make a Spot check.”
All players: All of the players roll d20s and add their Spot skill modifiers.
Regdar’s player lucks out and gets the highest result, an 18.
Dungeon Master: “While the rest of you stare at the golden statue, Regdar
notices that a panel in the far wall has swung aside. Beyond, Regdar sees
82
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

a dark opening. Something has begun to emerge from that opening, but
only Regdar sees it. What are you going to do?”
What happens next? That depends on the Dungeon Master and the actions of
the players!
What can you do while exploring?
While exploring a dungeon or other adventure location, characters can do
any of the following actions:
 Search the walls for secret doors.
 Listen at doors.
 Check doors to see if they are locked.
 Force open or unlock a door.
 Search rooms for treasure.
 Manipulate levers or push statues.
 Use the Intimidate skill to frighten a kobold, for example, into telling the
party what waits around the bend.
 Do anything else you can think of!
Characters can do all sorts of things as they explore an adventure location.
They might break apart a cabinet to locate a secret compartment, gather sand
into a pouch, try to build a makeshift bridge out of a table, or do whatever
else the players can think of.
The Dungeon Master decides whether or not something the characters try
actually works. Some things are easy and characters can succeed automatically.
It doesn’t take any special skill or luck to fill a pouch with sand, for example.
Other actions are impossible. No character can smash through a 12-inch
thick, solid stone wall by hitting it with his or her fist.
When there’s a possibility of either success or failure, and the task doesn’t
relate to any particular skill, the DM calls for an ability check.
Ability checks
To make an ability check, a player rolls a d20 and adds his or her character’s
bonus associated with the ability that best fits the action. If the DM decides
that the result is high enough, using the sample DCs provided in the D&D 
83
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

rulebooks as a guide, the character succeeds. Here are some examples of
ability checks and the DCs required to succeed:
 Trying to break down a strong wooden door requires a DC 18 Strength
check.
 Attempting to thread a needle requires a DC 5 Dexterity check.
 Holding your breath for a long time requires a DC 10 Constitution check.
 Navigating a challenging maze requires a DC 20 Intelligence check.
 Recognizing the NPC rogue who was following your character at the
market requires a DC 10 Wisdom check.
 Making sure your character gets noticed in a crowd requires a DC 15
Charisma check.

I
n the preceding chapters, we present an overview of the basics of the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, we introduce a group of ready-to-play charac-
ters, and we show you how to make attack and damage rolls, skill checks,
and saving throws. After going over the basics, you can actually roll some
dice and see how it all comes together at the gaming table.
This chapter takes you on a tour of a sample play session of DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS. Note that you need a set of D&D dice to participate in this practice
session. You can get a set of D&D dice at your local game store or bookstore,
or you can buy a set from any online game seller. When you get your dice,
continue with this practice session.
The Battle Grid and Markers
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game uses three-dimensional components to help
players visualize scenes and work through tactics and strategy in combat.
Miniatures and a battle grid provide the best way to visualize the action.
A fold-out battle grid is included with this book. One side has an open grid
that can be used to replicate any dungeon scene. The other side is set up as a
portion of a dungeon and can be used with the sample adventure presented
in Chapter 24. 

A battle grid consists of a grid of 1-inch squares. You can count distances
in squares, or you can convert to the game world dimensions of 1 square
equals 5 feet. For example, Regdar has a speed of 4, meaning that he can
move 4 squares (20 feet) in a turn and make an attack.
You use the battle grid and miniatures or other markers (see the following
section, “Markers”) to show the marching order of your group of adventurers
or the relative location of characters and monsters in any given encounter.
The best use for the battle grid is for when the characters stumble or charge
into combat. When you can see how far away or how close the monster is, as
well as where other player characters are in relation to it and your character,
you can plan better moves and make full use of the environment during combat
encounters.
A larger version of the battle grid can be found in the D&D Dungeon Master’s
Guide. More durable grids made of vinyl can be purchased at game and hobby
stores or from online game sellers.
Markers
The battle grid only works if you use something to represent player charac-
ters and monsters. The battle grid in this book features cut-out markers that
include a mix of characters and monsters. Carefully cut apart the markers
and set them aside for later use. If you’re ambitious, you can gather a bunch
of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS miniatures to use instead of the markers. 
Most characters and many monsters are considered to be Medium in size. A
Medium character occupies a single square on the battle grid. Large creatures
occupy a 2 x 2 area, or 4 squares. Only one character or creature can occupy
a square. Characters can move through squares occupied by friendly charac-
ters, but they can’t move through squares occupied by enemies. Characters
can’t stop moving in an occupied square (whether the occupier is a friend or
enemy doesn’t matter). (For the purposes of the battle grid, Small characters —
such as Lidda — occupy a single square.)
Moving on the battle grid
In a turn, your character can move up to a number of squares equal to his
or her speed and make an attack. If you just want to move your character
(making no attack), your character can move up to twice his or her speed.
For example, Regdar has a speed of 4. In a turn, he can move up to 4 squares
and make an attack, or he can move up to 8 squares if he doesn’t make an
attack. (See Figure 8-1.)
86
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Figure 8-1: Non-diagonal movement.
When measuring diagonal distances, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the
second diagonal counts as 2 squares, the third diagonal counts as 1 square,
the fourth diagonal counts as 2 squares, and so on. Think of each diagonal as
1.5 squares. So, Regdar can move 3 squares (1+2+1 = 4) along a diagonal path
and make an attack against a monster on his turn. (See Figure 8-2.)
The extra cost for diagonal movement applies only to movement and deter-
mining distance for ranged attacks and spells. A character using a melee
weapon can always attack a monster in any adjacent square — diagonal or
non-diagonal from his or her position.

Chapter 8: Practice Session

Practice: A Sparring Match
The first way to test the game and run your character through the paces is to
have a practice fight against another character. Pick the character you want
to play from the ready-to-play characters presented in Chapters 3 through 6.
Have a friend pick a different character. We suggest that each of you select a
fighter from Chapter 3 for your first practice session. Fighters are the easiest
and most straightforward characters to play.
Understand that this practice session’s purpose is to give you and a friend
a feel for the game mechanics. A full-scale D&D game requires a Dungeon
Master to run the adventure. To give you a sense of moving and fighting D&D
style, we focus on the basics with a scenario that would almost never happen
in the game — you and your friend would instead be playing characters on
the same adventuring team, and so your characters wouldn’t be fighting each
other. Another way to think of this practice session is that your characters
are sparring or practicing, not fighting to the death.
Next, carefully cut out two of the player character markers, one for each player.
Placing characters on the battle grid
Before you get started with combat, you need to set up a few things.
Here’s how:
1. Set the battle grid included with this book on the table between you
and your friend. 
2. Place your character marker in one of the grid’s corners. 
Your opponent places his or her marker in the opposite corner diago-
nally across the grid.
3. Each of you rolls initiative. Roll the d20 and add your initiative modi-
fier. The character with the highest result acts first, and then you take
turns for the rest of this combat.
For example, Redgar’s player rolls a 10 and adds +1 for a result of 11.
Tordek’s player rolls a 14 and adds +1 for a result of 15. Tordek goes
first, then Regdar, then Tordek, and so on until one of the characters
wins the practice battle.
88
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

What to do on a turn
Each turn, a character can move and attack, attack and move, or just move
(which allows the character to move up to twice his or her speed). Because
fighters really love to get up close and personal in a battle, the first couple of
turns, they will either make a ranged attack and move or just move to close
the distance between them and the enemy.
Remember that to make an attack, you roll a d20 and add the modifier for the
weapon your character is using. If an attack hits (you get a result that’s equal
to or higher than your opponent’s Armor Class), roll the die or dice listed for
the weapon’s damage. Damage reduces a character’s hit points.
When one character is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he or she is defeated.
The other character wins the practice session!
Example of a sparring match
To help you get a better idea of the intricacies of game combat, we’ve added
a blow-by-blow example of combat between the fighter Tordek and the fighter
Regdar. Here’s how it would happen:
Turn 1 — Tordek: Tordek got a higher initiative result, so he goes first.
He starts off by making a ranged attack with his shortbow. He rolls a 7 on
the d20 and adds +2 (the modifier for his shortbow attack) for a result of
9. Regdar has an Armor Class of 15, so Tordek’s attack misses. Then
Tordek moves 4 squares closer to Regdar. Tordek has attacked and
moved. His turn ends.
Turn 1 — Regdar: Regdar goes next. He decides to do the same thing. He
rolls a 17 and adds +2 for a result of 19 with his shortbow attack. That’s
higher than Tordek’s Armor Class of 17, so the attack hits. Regdar rolls
damage next. He rolls a 2 on a d6 (the damage die for his shortbow).
Tordek reduces his hit points by 2. He now has 11 hit points remaining.
Regdar then moves 4 squares closer to Tordek, and his turn ends.
Turn 2 — Tordek: Tordek is still far enough away that he decides to
make another ranged attack against Regdar. He rolls an 11 and adds +2.
The result of 13 is not high enough to equal or beat Regdar’s Armor Class.
He moves 4 squares closer to Regdar and his turn ends.
Turn 2 — Regdar: Regdar decides to spend this turn switching weapons.
He puts away his shortbow and draws his greatsword, in anticipation of
the melee battle to come.
89
Chapter 8: Practice Session

Turn 3 — Tordek: Tordek moves closer and makes another ranged attack.
This time he rolls a 15 and adds +2 for a result of 17. He hits Regdar! He
rolls a 4 on a d6 and deals 4 points of damage. Regdar now has 8 hit points
remaining.
Turn 3 — Regdar: Regdar moves next to Tordek on this turn and makes
an attack with his greatsword. He rolls a 15 and adds +4 (the modifier for
his greatsword) for 19. That’s a hit! Regdar rolls two six-sided dice and
adds +3 to deal damage. He rolls a 2 and a 5 on the dice, for a total of 10
(2+5+3). Tordek has 1 hit point left!
Turn 4 — Tordek: Tordek spends the turn switching weapons. He now
wields a dwarven waraxe.
Turn 4 — Regdar: Regdar attacks again. He rolls a 2, and the result of 6
isn’t enough to hit Tordek.
Turn 5 — Tordek: Now Tordek gets a chance to make a melee attack. His
modifier for the waraxe is +4. He rolls a 12, and the result of 16 (12+4) is a
hit. The waraxe deals d10+2 damage, and Tordek’s result is 6. Regdar has
2 hit points remaining.
How does this tense practice session end? Grab the character sheets and
dice and find out for yourself!
Player Characters versus Monsters
The next practice session involves player characters and monsters. This is
closer to a real combat encounter that you would have in any D&D adventure.
You need players; say there are four of you, one to play a character of each
class. You need a Dungeon Master to run the monsters. Have each player
select a character to play. The DM should carefully cut out the two orc mark-
ers; these are the monsters that the four player characters will face in this
practice session. Note that both orcs have the same statistics and the same
amount of hit points.
Placing characters on the battle grid
Set the battle grid included with this book on the table and make sure the
players and DM can comfortably sit around the play area with room for char-
acter sheets and dice rolling. The four player characters start on one end of
the battle grid. The DM places the two orc markers anywhere in the middle
of the battle grid.
90
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Next, everyone rolls initiative. Roll the d20 and add your character’s initiative
modifier. The DM makes a single roll that covers both orcs. (The orc statistics
can be found in the “Orc” sidebar on the next page.) The DM jots down each
character’s result, in order, from highest to lowest. That sets the order of play
for this combat encounter.
For example, Redgar rolls a 10 and adds +1 for a result of 11. Shadow rolls a 14
and adds +6 for a result of 20. Wellyn rolls a 16 and adds +2 for a result of 18.
Eberk rolls a 3 and adds –1 for a result of 2. The DM rolls a 5 and adds +0 for a
result of 5 for the orcs. So, the initiative order for this combat looks like this:
Shadow
20
Wellyn
18
Regdar
11
Orcs
5
Eberk
2
What to do on a turn
Each turn, a character can move and attack, attack and move, or just move
(which allows the character to move up to twice his or her speed). The orcs
have the same options.
Remember that to make an attack, you roll a d20 and add the modifier for the
weapon your character is using. If an attack hits (you get a result that’s equal
to or higher than your opponent’s Armor Class), roll the die or dice listed for
the weapon’s damage. Damage reduces a character’s (or monster’s) hit points.
If the characters reduce both orcs to 0 hit points, the characters win the
combat. If the orcs reduce all of the characters to 0 hit points, the orcs win
the combat.
The Dungeon Master
The presence of a Dungeon Master turns D&D from a board game into a role-
playing game where anything can happen. You can run this practice session
with the DM simply controlling the actions of the monsters, or you can let the
DM practice his or her DMing skills. A Dungeon Master isn’t competing against
the players (even though he or she controls their opponents in an adventure).
The DM sets the scene, describes the action, and calls for skill checks and
other rolls when necessary. 
91
Chapter 8: Practice Session

Example of player versus monster combat
Here’s how the first round of this combat encounter might play out: 
Turn 1 — Shadow: Shadow goes first (she had the highest initiative result).
She draws her hand crossbow and fires at the orc on the right. She rolls a
4 on the d20 and adds her modifier of –2 for a result of 2. That’s not enough
to hit the orc’s Armor Class of 13, and the hand crossbow bolt whizzes
past the orc’s head.
Turn 1 — Wellyn: Wellyn acts next. He decides to use a spell against the
orc on the right. He declares that he is casting a magic missile spell. No
attack roll is necessary for this particular spell; the magic missile leaps
from Wellyn’s finger and automatically hits the orc. Wellyn’s player rolls
damage and deals 4 points of damage to the orc on the right. The DM
makes a note that the orc has 1 hit point remaining.
Turn 1 — Regdar: Regdar acts next. He isn’t close enough to move and
attack an orc, but he can just move (effectively moving twice) to cover 8
squares and wind up next to the orc on the left.
Turn 1 — Orcs: The orcs get to act now. The orc on the left swings his 
falchion (a big, curved sword) at Regdar. The DM rolls a d20 and adds the
orc’s modifier of +4 for a result of 16. That’s a hit! The orc deals 10 points
of damage to Regdar, leaving the fighter with 2 hit points.
Turn 1 — Eberk: Eberk has a turn now. He moves up behind Regdar so
that he can cast a cure light wounds spell on his next turn and heal some
of the damage to the fighter.
The first round of the combat has ended. Will the adventurers beat the orcs
and win the day? Roll some dice and find out by playing through this scenario
yourself!

Adding Story Elements
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game provides a platform for players to tell exciting
stories in a medieval fantasy world. It’s easy for the Dungeon Master to add
story elements to an encounter and for the players to imagine what kinds of
things their characters will do. In this section, we take the orc battle example
and add some story elements to it.
Use the dungeon side of the battle grid. Pick any room and place the markers
for the two orcs anywhere within it. Let the player characters start outside
the room, somewhere down the corridor. The DM decides that the orcs have
recently raided a human village, and now they’re inside this dungeon room
dividing their spoils. Maybe the orcs have a sack of ten silver pieces, a rusty
sword, a scrawny dog tied to a table leg, and a scroll they stole from an empty
farmhouse. The orcs are laughing and congratulating themselves in their
course language when the player characters reach the corridor beyond.
Now the DM calls for Listen skill checks. The DM decides that it isn’t too hard
to hear the orcs and sets a target of 10 (called the Difficulty Class or DC) for
the check. If any of the characters get a result of 10 or better on their check,
they hear the noise coming from the room.
If the characters all fail to hear the noise, then the DM can see if the orcs hear
the approaching characters. Because the orcs are laughing and talking, the
DM decides that they’d have a harder time hearing the player characters and
sets the DC at 15. 
Now, maybe the characters know that something is in the room, maybe they
don’t. Maybe the orcs know the characters are coming, maybe they don’t.
The DM can use this information to build tension and drama as the charac-
ters move closer to the room.
When the characters finally reach the room and look in, they see the two
orcs, a table, and the spoils from the village. Can the adventurers defeat the
orcs? Will the orcs try to fight or beg for their lives? What about the spoils?
Is the rusty sword enchanted with magic power? Did the scroll belong to a
wizard or does it have some important message scrawled upon its surface?
Maybe it’s a map to another dungeon and some fantastic treasure. 
Story isn’t hard, and the elements it brings to the game are fun! Give it a try
after you’ve had some combat practice.

D
UNGEONS & DRAGONS is a cooperative game; you need at least one other
person to play with, and preferably as many as five or six people alto-
gether. One person is the Dungeon Master, the player who runs the monsters,
presents the dungeon or adventure, and generally keeps the game moving.
Everybody else is a player character — a player who runs a single character
in the DM’s adventure.
In this chapter, we take a look at finding a game to play in, organizing your
own game if you can’t (or don’t want to) find another game to play in, and
joining a high-level game. We also provide you with a ready-to-play character
at 4th level and at 8th level — Regdar, the human fighter.
A Typical Game Session
You might wonder what a D&D game session looks like. What do people wear,
what do they bring, how long do they play, and where do they play? The best
comparison for a D&D game is a regular Friday night poker game. People dress
casual, they usually meet at somebody’s house, they bring some snacks or
drinks and what they need to play, and the game usually runs three or four
hours — sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.

When you get invited to join a D&D game, it’s a good idea to ask or check
about the following:
 When is the game? Make sure you’re punctual!
 Where is the game? Make sure you get good directions to the host’s
house or the hobby store, library, community center, or such place
where the game is taking place. Get a street address and use MapQuest
(www.mapquest.com) if you need to, or arrange to ride to the game with
a friend.
 Who’s the Dungeon Master? As a new player, the DM is your best friend.
Get in touch with the DM a day or two before the game and find out what
he or she expects of you. 
 Ask what game materials you can bring. Most players show up for a
game with the Player’s Handbook, a set of D&D dice, something to write
with and on, and their character sheet. Bring this For Dummies book if
you expect to play one of the ready-made characters presented in
Chapters 3 through 6.
 Ask if you can bring food and beverages. Bring some cash so you can
pitch in for a pizza or something.
 Don’t assume it’s okay to bring children. Older children may very well
want to play in the game with you, and that’s something you need to
clear with the people you will be playing with. Younger children demand
your time and attention, and they will probably make things difficult for
you and for everybody else. D&D night is probably a good time to get a
babysitter. 
The first few times you play, it’s a good idea to do a lot of listening and watch-
ing and not so much talking. As you’re learning your character’s abilities and
figuring out how the game works, pay attention to how the other players con-
duct themselves at the table. You can take your cues from them.
Finding Someone to Play With
So, say that you bought the Player’s Handbook, flipped through the book
you’re holding in your hands, and have generally decided you’d like to play
some D&D. How do you go about finding a game to play in? You’ve got two
basic choices: Find someone else’s game to join or organize your own game.
96
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Joining someone else’s game
This is probably the easiest way to go if you’re a novice at D&D. Find an exist-
ing group of players who are willing to make some room for you at the table
and begin playing with those folks. Every week, hundreds of thousands of
people gather for regular D&D games with friends or strangers, just like
people fall into regular poker games, bowling leagues, or bingo nights. All you
have to do is identify an existing group somewhere near you and let them
know you’re interested.
So where do you find a D&D group meeting in your town? Try the following:
 Friends and family: Ask people you know to find out if somebody is in a
game or if that person knows somebody who’s in a game.
 Gaming clubs: Many high schools and colleges have active gaming
clubs. If you’re a student, see if your school has a club or organization
that sponsors regular games.
 The friendly local gaming store: People looking for players to join their
game, or people looking for games to join, often post messages in local
hobby stores. You won’t find this sort of “player corkboard” at a big
bookstore that carries D&D books — you’ll need to find local hobby
stores for this kind of search. The best hobby stores often sponsor
games right on-site, which is a great way to meet people you might
want to game with.
 The Internet: Some popular Web sites or message boards frequented by
D&D fans include “players seeking players” posts. A good site for this sort
of thing is www.wizards.com/community. If you’re under 18, please check
with your parents before you start trying to meet strangers online.
 The RPGA: This stands for Roleplaying Gamers Association, a worldwide
network of D&D fans. Contact the RPGA at www.wizards.com/rpga and
ask them if there are any RPGA chapters in your hometown. 
Now, here’s the hard part: Most gamers understand that it can be difficult to
find a game to play in, but you need to show some courtesy when you ask to
join a gaming group of strangers. Try something like, “I understand you run a
regular D&D game. I’m interested in trying it out. Are you looking for new
players?” Don’t take it too personally if the answer is no; it’s not unusual for
Dungeon Masters to decline to add new players if they’re already running a
game with a lot of players in it.
97
Chapter 9: Finding a D&D Game to Join

Organizing your own game
If you can’t locate an existing game to join, you’ll need to organize your own
game. Most players expect a D&D game to be an ongoing, regularly scheduled
event — just like that weekly poker night we were talking about.
Your first order of business is finding a Dungeon Master (DM). Chances are
good that you know someone — or know someone who knows someone —
who’s played D&D before and can serve as the gamemaster. If at all possible,
you want an experienced player to be your group’s DM. Failing that, you’ll
need to choose a DM for your new game. Because you’re trying to organize
the thing, you might as well take a stab at it.
After you’ve determined who’s going to be the DM, you need to round up a
group of reliable and interested players. Ideally, you’d like to start with three
to five players and one Dungeon Master. To find players, ask friends first.
Family members are okay, but we suggest siblings or cousins — if you bring
a parent or child to a game where most other people are about your age,
you may create an awkward social dynamic for everybody else (of course,
if everybody at the table is in your immediate family, that’s not a problem).
If you can’t find enough players by asking people you know, you can try fish-
ing for fellow gamers in your town. Post notices at your local hobby store or
look for school gaming clubs (if you’re a student, that is).
After you’ve gathered enough people to play, choose a place and a time to
meet. In the long run, you’d like to find a good game night that could be regu-
larly scheduled for everybody in your game, but when you’re just starting it,
there’s no reason you can’t schedule your games one at a time. Find a place
where you can put half-a-dozen people around a good-sized table and not
bother other folks by making a lot of noise. If you play at a house where there
will be small children around, make sure that somebody (preferably, some-
one who’s not trying to play D&D with you) will be able to pay attention to
the kids and keep them entertained. 
98
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
The D&D Basic Game
If you’re a novice, and everyone you’re playing
with is a novice too, we highly recommend that
you get your hands on the D&D Basic Game and
start there. The D&D Basic Game includes dice,
miniatures, ready-to-play characters, a battle
grid, and ready-to-run dungeon scenarios. It’s the
best starting place for people who have never
played the game before, and you’ll have a much
easier time learning the ropes with the Basic
Game than you will with the Player’s Handbook
and Dungeon Master’s Guide. 

Starting Off with a High-Level Character
When you join a gaming group that’s been playing together for a while, there’s
an excellent chance that their characters are well past 1st level. For example,
you might be told something like, “Great, glad you can join the game — bring
a 4th-level character on Saturday!”
Most Dungeon Masters have some ground rules for how new characters can
join the game, so you should ask ahead of time who’s going to be the Dungeon
Master and find out from that person how you should build a character to
suit. Don’t be afraid to ask for help getting ready. But sometimes you might
be joining a game blind, without any knowledge of who’s DMing, what sort of
game they’re running, or how to get a character ready to play fast. For those
circumstances, we provide you with a 4th-level and 8th-level version of Regdar,
the fighter (see Chapter 3 for Regdar at 1st level). As a new player, you’ll find
that the easiest character class to play at higher levels is the fighter. When you
get to your new game, tell the Dungeon Master that you’re ready to play a
4th-level fighter or an 8th-level fighter out of this book, if it’s okay by him or her. 
If you want to play a fighter with Regdar’s stats but don’t like the name, change
it to something you like. If you prefer a female character, you need only change
the name or use the character sheet for Brenna. Brenna has similar game sta-
tistics to Redgar, so your character’s gender is simply a matter of preference.
99
Chapter 9: Finding a D&D Game to Join

Regdar, 4th-Level Human Fighter
As a 4th-level character, Regdar has learned a number of new feats and skills
since he was 1st level. He uses better equipment and fights much more effec-
tively than he did at 1st level.

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book is written for the player who
decides to become more invested in the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. We take the basic material we introduced
earlier in the book and expand upon it. In this part, we help
you navigate the D&D Player’s Handbook and show you how
to make solid, informed choices about the kind of charac-
ter you want to build and how to best play that character
at the gaming table. From fully defining the D&D character
to examining classes, races, and feat and skill choices, we
walk you through the character creation process and tell
you what to look for as you gain experience and “level up”
your character.

T
his is the part of the book where you move on from basic game concepts
and dive head-first into the full DUNGEONS & DRAGONS rules experience.
Don’t worry, we help you through it. And when you’re done, you’ll see that
even the advanced rules aren’t that tough or scary. Just keep the basics from
Part I in mind, and we’ll handle the rest.
At this point, we figure that you’ve used one of the ready-to-play characters
from Part I to play a game or two of D&D. Now you’re ready to create your own
character from the ground up. After all, creativity is one of the most compelling
aspects of roleplaying, and it all starts with your player character.
In this chapter, you take a more detailed look at the D&D character. We go
over all the basic statistics again, but this time delving into all of the possi-
ble things you can do with them. This chapter helps you navigate the rest of
Part II, explaining the parts of a full D&D character sheet and then pointing
you to the information you need to fill out each section as you create your
own character.
Your Character Sheet
A D&D character record sheet contains all the pertinent information and game
statistics for your player character. A character sheet can be as simple as a
blank piece of paper upon which you’ve written down all of your character’s

statistics. Or you could use the two-page character sheet that you can photo-
copy in the back of the D&D Player’s Handbook (see Figures 10-1 and 10-2). For
really invested players, you can buy the official D&D Deluxe Player Character
Sheets package that provides four-page character sheet folios for every class.
Use whichever version of the character sheet that you feel most comfortable
with. The information that follows pertains to all versions of D&D character
sheets.
Figure 10-1: The character sheet from the Player’s Handbook
(front side).
There are numerous ways to approach the creation of a D&D character. Some
people start out knowing exactly the kind of character they want to play, from
race and class to specific roleplaying quirks and background information.
Others let the dice fall where they may and then build their characters around
the ability scores they rolled. Then there are those who know one aspect of
the character they want to play (either the race or class, for example) and
then decide on the rest after they see how the dice come out. These are all
acceptable ways to approach character creation. Throughout the chapters in
this part, we provide details to help you make informed decisions, no matter
which approach you take.
108
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Figure 10-2: The character sheet from the Player’s Handbook
(back side).
Filling Out the Character Sheet
You can fill out your character sheet in any order that makes sense to you.
We discuss the various sections of the character sheet in the order they
appear, however, so you can more easily reference the material. 
Names
There’s a place on the front of the character sheet for your name and your
character’s name. A cool, evocative name helps set the personality of your
character and contributes to the tone of the campaign, so choose your charac-
ter’s name wisely. A campaign with characters named Elfy, Sugarplum, Bennie,
and Toejam has a very different feel than one that features Regdar, Lidda,
Wellyn, and Jerek. Talk with your Dungeon Master and the other players to
decide what kind of names (and what kind of campaign) you all want to play,
and then name your character accordingly. A good, solid name is important,
and even though it appears at the top of your character sheet, this is the
109
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

piece of information you’ll probably record last, after you see how the rest of
your character’s statistics turn out and you’ve had a chance to think about it. 
The D&D Player’s Handbook provides lists of sample names by character race
in Chapter 2. Feel free to use one of these names or to draw inspiration from
them as you craft your own name for your character.
Class and level
Class, perhaps more than any other characteristic, has the most profound
effect on your character’s adventuring career. Class helps determine a char-
acter’s role in the adventuring party and provides a character with special
qualities that set him or her apart from the rest of the team. You can select a
class and then apply your ability scores appropriately, or you can roll ability
scores and select a class that takes best advantage of your results.
Character level is usually easy when you’re creating a starting character: All
characters start at 1st level unless the Dungeon Master gives you different
instructions. (Sometimes a DM has characters start at a level more suitable
for the campaign he or she plans to run, such as 3rd level if the DM wants the
characters to have a little experience prior to the start of the campaign.)
Chapter 11 provides detailed information on choosing a class. Chapter 18 dis-
cusses levels and character advancement for when you’re ready to improve
your character.
Race
Another key defining aspect of a D&D character is the fantasy race the char-
acter belongs to. In addition to humans, the fantasy worlds of D&D are inhab-
ited by all kinds of amazing, intelligent beings. Want to play an enigmatic elf?
How about a dour dwarf? Maybe a dangerously curious halfling? Race provides
more than a colorful hook for roleplaying. Each race has ability adjustments,
a favored class, and special abilities to help set it apart from the others. After
you’ve decided on a race for your character, record it on the character sheet.
Chapter 13 discusses the core D&D races in more detail and provides the
information you need to choose among them.
Alignment and deity
Where does your character fit into the ongoing struggle between good and
evil? It’s a big question, but the answer to it (or at least the trip to discover
110
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

the answer) pervades every fantasy epic from The Lord of the Rings to the
Tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The same is true of
any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. In the D&D game, your character’s general
moral and personal attitudes are represented by the character’s alignment.
Whether you choose to be lawful good or chaotic evil, alignment is a tool for
developing your character’s identity in the game. Alignment isn’t designed to
be restrictive, and characters can always behave inconsistently from time to
time. It is used to provide a broad range of touchstones upon which you can
develop your character.
The thing to remember with alignment is that players should talk about their
choices before setting anything in stone. For example, your Dungeon Master
may have a particular type of campaign in mind, one that works best if the
characters all have complimentary alignments. Sometimes the tension gener-
ated by having a chaotic evil character in with a group of lawful good ones
can be fun, but often such deviations lead to troublesome play and hard feel-
ings. Better to all move in compatible directions than in competitive ones
when playing D&D.
Another thing to consider when choosing your character’s alignment is that
D&D is really about heroes. The game works best when player characters
choose alignments that are either good or neutral in outlook. Antiheroes
and villains have their place in fantasy stories, but the most memorable, 
long-lasting D&D campaigns focus on the good guys.
Along with alignment, a character’s choice of deity can help create a back-
ground and personality that makes the roleplaying stronger. A character’s
deity is a personal choice, though the game provides guidelines by providing
two helpful tables, “Deities by Race” and “Deities by Class,” on page 106 of the
Player’s Handbook. Now, every campaign is different and may have a different
selection of deities. Your Dungeon Master will tell you if you should select a
deity from the list in the Player’s Handbook or from some other source (such
as the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting). 
In the end, character alignment and deity choice are mostly for flavor and to
help you roleplay your character better. Your choice of deity is more important
if you’re playing a cleric; see Chapter 11 and Chapter 17 for more information.
Character description
The next section of the character sheet provides a place to record infor-
mation that helps describe your character but has little effect on game play.
Of these, only the Size and Age entries have game mechanics associated with
them. Most player characters are either Small or Medium in size, and most
starting characters are barely into the adult age category when they begin
adventuring.
111
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

Most of the character races, including dwarves, elves, and humans, are
Medium in size. That’s the standard, and there are no special bonuses or
penalties associated with characters of this size. Medium characters occupy
a single square on the battle grid. Small characters, such as halflings, also
take up a single square.
Halflings are Small in size. Small characters gain a +1 size bonus to Armor
Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 bonus on Hide checks. On the
other hand, they have to use smaller weapons that deal less damage, they
generally move about 2⁄3 as fast as Medium characters, and their lifting and
carrying limits are 3⁄4 of those of Medium characters. For more details about
Small characters, see the halfling entry in Chapter 13.
Age, height, and weight for your character are determined by personal choice
(and DM approval) or by random generation. See “Vital Statistics” in Chapter 6
of the D&D Player’s Handbook for details and associated tables.
What you put in the Gender, Eyes, Hair, and Skin entries are all personal
choices that have almost no effect in the game. Male and female characters
are totally equal, and few in the fantasy worlds of D&D care if a character’s
skin is brown, pink, or metallic gold. Chapter 2 in the Player’s Handbook talks
about the general appearance of each of the races, and you can use the
descriptions there as a starting point.
Ability scores
In addition to class, race, and level, a character’s ability scores provide the
base upon which your character grows and develops. Consider ability scores
the frame upon which the rest of your statistics are hung. Every character
has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma. These scores provide modifiers that effect everything from
attacks and damage rolls to skill checks and saving throws.
Chapter 12 provides more information about ability scores and how they are
used.
Hit points
When combat begins, your character’s hit points (hp) are literally all that
stands between a character and certain death. Class and level determine
your character’s hit point total, adjusted by your character’s Constitution
modifier. Lose a few hit points in battle? No problem! Your character contin-
ues to function without any ill effects as long as he or she has at least 1 hit
point remaining. That’s heroic and fantastic, and that’s pure D&D. 
112
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

When your character takes damage in battle or through some other method
(such as a trap or a natural hazard), that damage reduces your character’s
hit point total. When your character’s hit point total reaches 0, he or she is
disabled. When it reaches –1, he or she is dying. When it drops to –10, your
character is dead. (See Chapter 7 for rules on dying characters.)
Healing, whether natural or magical in nature, can restore lost hit points back
up to your original total, but even getting healed back up to 1 hit point means
that your character is ready to get back into the action.
Each character class has an associated Hit Die. Fighters, for example, have a
d10 Hit Die, while sorcerers have a d4 Hit Die. At 1st level, all characters receive
the maximum hit points based on their class’s Hit Die — so a 1st-level fighter
gets 10 hit points! But you’re not done yet. You also get to apply your charac-
ter’s Constitution modifier to the hit point total. For example, Regdar the fighter
has a +2 Constitution modifier, so his hit point total at 1st level is 12. When a
character reaches 2nd level (and for every level he or she gains thereafter),
you roll the appropriate die (the Hit Die), adding the character’s Constitution
modifier, and then add the result to your character’s hit point total. Regdar,
for example, adds d10+2 to his hit point total each time he goes up a level. 
Armor Class
Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to hit your character
in combat. It’s the attack roll result — the target number — that an opponent
needs to achieve to hit you. Every character and creature in the game starts
with a base AC of 10. Various factors combine to improve or reduce that
number. Your character’s AC is determined as follows:
AC = 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier
Not every character will have all of these components. Some characters use
armor, some don’t. Some carry shields, some don’t. Some have Dexterity or
size modifiers, some don’t. Add up all the modifiers you have that apply to
determine your character’s Armor Class.
For example, Regdar’s AC is 15 because he wears scale mail armor (+4) and
has a Dexterity modifier of +1 (10+4+1 = 15). Lidda, on the other hand, has an
AC of 16 because she wears leather armor (+2), has a Dexterity modifier of +3,
and a size modifier of +1 due to her Small size (10+2+3+1 = 16).
Every character also has target numbers to hit based on situations where the
full Armor Class isn’t applicable. These situations are as follows:
 Touch AC: Touch attacks, such as attacks with certain spells (the chill
touch spell, for example), disregard armor and shield bonuses. Your touch
AC doesn’t include any bonuses for armor or shield, but all other modifiers
113
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

apply, such as Dexterity and size modifiers. In the previous examples,
Regdar’s touch AC is 11, while Lidda’s touch AC is 14. You’ll never have to
guess if an attack is a touch attack: Touch attacks or spells are defined as
such in the descriptions of the monsters or spells in the official rulebooks.
 Flat-footed AC: Characters are considered to be flat-footed at the start of
a battle, before they have had a chance to act (before their first turn in the
initiative order). A character can’t use his or her Dexterity modifier when
flat-footed. Bonuses for size, armor, and shield still apply. In the previous
examples, Regdar’s flat-footed AC is 14. Lidda’s flat-footed AC is 13.
Record your character’s touch AC and flat-footed AC in the appropriate
places on your character sheet.
Speed
A character’s speed shows how far the character can move in a round and
still do something else, such as make an attack or cast a spell. Speed can
be displayed as a number of feet or squares the character can move and do
something else. Your character’s speed is determined by his or her race and
by the type of armor that he or she is wearing. If you decide to just move in a
round, your character can move up to twice his or her speed.
Dwarves and halflings have a speed of 20 feet (4 squares). A dwarf always has
a speed of 20 feet, but a halfling’s speed is reduced to 15 feet (3 squares) if he
or she is wearing medium or heavy armor. Humans and elves have a speed of
30 feet (6 squares). This is reduced to 20 feet (4 squares) if they wear
medium or heavy armor.
Initiative
Initiative is a Dexterity check. Your character’s initiative modifier is the
same value as his or her Dexterity modifier. However, you can improve your
character’s initiative by selecting the Improved Initiative feat (see Chapter 5
of the Player’s Handbook for this and other feat descriptions).
Saving throws
There are more dangers in D&D worlds than simply being attacked by sword,
bow, or claw. Environmental hazards, magical attacks, poisons, and mental
attacks are among the numerous other dangers adventurers face on a daily
basis. Saving throws can help characters reduce or even avoid the effects of
these dangers.
114
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

To determine your saving throw modifier in each case, add the base save
bonus (determined by your character’s class — see Chapter 11) and the
appropriate ability modifier. The three types of saving throws are
 Fortitude saves: This type of save measures your character’s ability to
withstand attacks against his or her health and vitality, such as poison,
disease, and energy drain. Apply your character’s Constitution modifier
to the base save to determine the Fortitude save.
 Reflex saves: This save tests your character’s ability to react quickly
enough to avoid area attacks such as breath weapons and fireball spells,
or effects such as pit traps and falling boulders. Apply your character’s
Dexterity modifier to the base save to determine the Reflex save.
 Will saves: This type of save reflects your character’s resistance to mental
influence and mental-attacking magical effects, such as psionic attacks
and illusion spells. Apply your character’s Wisdom modifier to the base
save to determine the Will save.
The target number (or Difficulty Class) for a saving throw is determined by the
attack or hazard itself. Your Dungeon Master probably won’t reveal the DC but
will instead simply ask you to roll the appropriate saving throw (roll a d20
and add the modifier for the saving throw) and tell him or her the resulting
number. The DM will then let you know if your character failed or succeeded
at the save. In extreme cases, or when the DM really wants to keep the play-
ers in suspense, he or she may make the rolls for the characters in secret.
Base attack bonus
Every class provides a base attack bonus. This bonus improves as a charac-
ter gains levels in a particular class. The combat-oriented classes (including
the fighter) have a better base attack bonus than more cerebral classes (such
as the sorcerer). Find your character’s base attack bonus on the appropriate
class table in Chapter 3 of the D&D Player’s Handbook and record it in this
section of your character sheet.
Attacks
Your character sheet provides space to record a number of different attack
options for your character. This allows you to list a few different melee weapons
and ranged weapons, depending on what your character is carrying and what
he or she has trained to use. Record the attack bonus for each type of attack
you might make. Remember that, when attacking, you make an attack roll
with a d20 and add your attack bonus to try to get a result that’s equal to or
greater than your target’s AC.
115
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

Your character’s attack bonus with a melee weapon is determined as follows:
Attack bonus (melee weapon) = base attack bonus + Strength modifier
+ size modifier + weapon bonus
Note that not every character will have a weapon bonus. Any bonus provided
by the weapon is due to using a magical weapon or because of a feat.
For example, Regdar’s attack bonus with his greatsword is +4 — base attack
bonus +1, Strength modifier +2, and +1 for taking the Weapon Focus
(greatsword) feat.
Your character’s attack bonus with a ranged weapon is calculated as follows:
Attack bonus (ranged weapon) = base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier +
size modifier + weapon bonus – range penalty
Again, note that any bonus provided by the weapon is due to using a magical
weapon or because of a feat. The range penalty exists only when your charac-
ter is far away from the target. At great distances, the target is harder to hit,
thus the range penalty. (Check the “Range Increment” description on page 114
of the Player’s Handbook for more information; also see the weapons tables on
pages 116–117 to find the range increment for each weapon.)
For example, Lidda’s attack bonus with her shortbow is +4 — base attack +0,
Dexterity modifier +3, and size modifier +1. The shortbow has a range incre-
ment of 60 feet. Each full range increment (every 60 feet between Lidda and
her target, in this case) imposes a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll.
So, if Lidda fires her shortbow at an orc that’s 70 feet away, she takes –2 to
her attack roll (lowering her attack bonus to +2) because the orc is farther
than one range increment away.
Every weapon brings its own statistics to the table, and these should be
recorded on your character sheet as well. A weapon has a damage rating that
tells you what to roll to deal damage after a successful attack. A weapon also
has a critical attack range, a number or series of numbers you roll on the d20
to determine if your attack is a critical attack (or a crit). You can find these
details on the weapons tables in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook. When you
attack with a melee weapon, you deal extra damage equal to your Strength
bonus (or 1.5 times your Strength bonus if it’s a weapon you wield with two
hands, such as a greatsword).
Skills
Every character has skills that represent a variety of training and experience
in different areas. Your character receives a number of skill points at each
level based on class and Intelligence modifier. See Chapter 11 for more details
on skill points per class per level.
116
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Skills are divided into two categories: class skills and cross-class skills. Class
skills are skills that members of your character’s class might learn in the course
of their training. Spend 1 skill point on a class skill and you get 1 rank in the
skill. Cross-class skills are skills that are not class skills for your character
class, and so they are harder to learn. Spend 1 skill point on a cross-class skill
and you get 1⁄2 rank in the skill. (In other words, it takes 2 skill points to buy 1
rank in a cross-class skill.) 
Every skill has a key ability. For example, the key ability for the Climb skill is
Strength. You apply the modifier for a skill’s key ability to determine your skill
modifier. You also apply your ranks in the skill and any other modifiers that may
by applicable, such as modifiers provided by feats. On your character sheet,
record all these numbers in the appropriate sections and total them to get
each skill modifier.
For example, take a look at Lidda the rogue’s Move Silently skill. Her Dexterity
modifier, the key ability for the skill, is +3. She buys 2 ranks in the skill, spend-
ing 2 skill points (Move Silently is a class skill for rogues). She also has a mis-
cellaneous modifier, in this case a +2 racial bonus that all halflings receive for
this skill. That gives her a Move Silently skill modifier of +7 (3+2+2 = 7).
To use a skill, you make a skill check. A skill check is a d20 roll to which you
add your skill modifier. So, when Lidda makes a Move Silently check to quietly
cross the chamber full of sleeping kobolds, she rolls d20+7.
For more information on skills, see Chapter 15.
Feats
Feats provide characters with new capabilities or improve existing abilities
in meaningful ways. A character either has a feat or not; you don’t buy them
with points and you don’t improve them with ranks. A character gains a feat
at 1st level and at other levels as he or she advances. Human characters gain
a bonus feat at 1st level, so they get to select two feats during character cre-
ation. In addition, certain classes gain bonus feats at different levels. A fighter,
for example, gains a bonus feat at 1st level. So, Regdar the human fighter starts
play with three feats — one that every character gets, one bonus feat for being
human, and one bonus feat for being a fighter.
Jot down the name of the feat or feats you select on the back of your charac-
ter sheet, as well as a brief description of the benefit it provides or the page
number of the Player’s Handbook where you can look up the details when you
need to.
For more details about feats, see Chapter 14.
117
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

Special abilities
Your character’s race and class provide certain special abilites. Record these
in the section on the back of the character sheet. 
For more information on race abilities, see Chapter 13. For more information
about class abilities, see Chapter 11.
Spells
Characters who have spellcasting classes choose a selection of spells. For
example, clerics and sorcerers are spellcasters and have spells. If you’re 
playing a sorcerer, record your character’s known spells in the spaces on the
back of the character sheet. If you’re playing a cleric, you may want to write
down your character’s prepared spells for that day on a piece of scrap paper,
especially if you expect to prepare different spells during the course of the
adventure.
For more information on spells, see Chapter 17.
Gear
Characters need equipment, and all kinds of adventuring gear is available to
get your character through the toughest dungeons. List the equipment your
character hauls around in the spaces provided on the character sheet.
For more information about adventuring gear, see Chapter 16.
Making Informed Choices
The rest of Part II walks you through the various components of your character
and gives you the information and advice you need to make decisions about
character creation. Which class is right for you? How should you distribute
ability scores? What feats and skills should you select? What kind of gear
should your character carry around? These questions and more are examined
in Chapters 11 through 18. Take each chapter one at a time, and by the end,
you’ll be ready to make informed choices throughout the character-creation
process.

D
UNGEONS & DRAGONS characters all share a thirst for excitement and a
need to adventure. They just have to explore the dark places of the
world and find increasingly difficult challenges with which to test themselves.
Where characters differ is in the way they approach each adventure and what
knowledge and abilities they bring to the table. A character’s class and level,
in large part, determines this approach. This chapter discusses both of these
characteristics.
Your character’s class is his or her profession or vocation. The class you
select determines much of what your character can do in the game. Your
character’s combat prowess, magical aptitude, skills, and other qualities
are defined and given boundaries by his or her class.
Your character’s level shows how much experience and training he or she
has acquired. A 1st-level character, for example, appears extremely green
next to a 10th-level character.
When you’re creating a character, the class you want to play suggests where
you should assign ability scores and even hints at which races are most appro-
priate to play. In all cases, however, these are only suggestions. D&D is a game
about choices and options, not restrictions. You can always play against type
if that better fits the concept you have for the character you want to play.
Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook goes into greater depth on character
classes and level benefits. Check it out after you read through this chapter.

Class and Level Benefits
Three factors determine success or failure when characters perform actions
in the game:
 A random factor (the d20 die roll)
 Innate ability (provided by your character’s ability score modifiers)
 Experience and training (represented by your character’s class and level)
Base attack bonus
In Chapter 7, we explore the basics of making attack rolls. This section looks
deeper into where the base component of an attack roll comes from.
It starts with your character’s base attack bonus. Your character’s class pro-
vides a base attack bonus that increases as your character gains levels. How
quickly this bonus increases is dependent upon one of three base attack bonus
progressions: good, average, and poor. Classes with a martial bend, such as
the fighter class, use the good base attack bonus progression. Classes that
take a more cerebral approach to adventuring, such as the sorcerer class, use
the poor base attack bonus progression to simulate a lack of combat training.
Classes that combine combat training with other focuses, such as the cleric
and rogue classes, use the average base attack bonus progression.
Table 3-1 in the Player’s Handbook shows the three base attack bonus pro-
gressions. In addition, each class table in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook
repeats this information as it applies to a particular class.
The difference between a good progression and a poor progression is how
fast it improves as your character goes up in level. A good progression, for
example, improves every level. A poor progression improves at about half
that rate. So, by the time a character with a good progression reaches 4th
level, his or her base attack bonus is +4. A character with a poor progression,
in contrast, has a +2 base attack bonus at 4th level.
At 1st level, a character’s base attack bonus is either +1 (if his or her class
uses the good progression) or +0 (if his or her class uses the average or poor
progressions). At higher levels, multiple bonuses are shown. Each bonus rep-
resents an additional attack the character can make in a round. To use these
additional attacks, the character can’t move in the round. Making multiple
attacks, if you have them, is called using a full-round action.
120
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

For example, Regdar’s base attack bonus at 8th level looks like this:
+8/+3
This means that if Regdar uses a full-round action (in other words, if he just
attacks in the round), his base attack bonus for his first attack is +8 and his
base attack bonus for his second attack is +3.
What does this mean when deciding on a class?
If you want your character to be good at making attacks, select a class that
uses the good base attack bonus progression. If you want to temper attack
power with other skills, select a class that uses the average base attack
bonus progression. If you want to be an arcane spellcaster, you have to go
with the poor base attack bonus progression — but these classes make up
for low attack power with powerful spells.
Classes and base attack bonuses
We focus on four classes throughout this For Dummies book: fighters, rogues,
sorcerers, and clerics. These are the easiest, most straightforward character
classes to play. There are other classes available in the D&D Player’s Handbook,
however. Table 11-1 shows, at a glance, which base attack bonus progression
each class uses.

Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

Base save bonus
Just as with base attack bonuses, character class provides different pro-
gressions for base save bonuses. As the name implies, these form the
basis for your character’s saving throws throughout the game. There are
good base save bonuses and poor base save bonuses. Every class assigns
either a good or poor progression to the three types of saves: Fortitude,
Reflex, and Will.
Table 3-1 in the Player’s Handbook shows the two base save bonus progres-
sions. In addition, each class table in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook
repeats this information as it applies to a particular class.
This information is good to have when making a decision about the class you
want to play, but you probably won’t select a class because it has a good or
poor base bonus in your favorite type of save.
Table 11-2 shows, at a glance, which base save bonus progression each class
uses for the three types of saves.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Level benefits
As characters advance in level, their base attack bonuses and base save
bonuses get better. The rate at which these bonuses improve depends on
the type of progression each bonus uses. For example, the fighter’s good
base attack bonus progresses at a faster rate than either the rogue’s average
progression or the sorcerer’s poor progression.
Level for characters of all classes is based on the number of experience
points (XP) a character has earned in the course of his or her adventures.
(Your DM will tell you how many experience points your character earned for
the adventure at the end of each game session. For more on gaining XP, see
Chapter 18.) Table 3-2 in the Player’s Handbook shows how many experience
points a character needs to attain a particular level.
For example, all characters start out with 0 XP at 1st level. A character earns
experience for defeating monsters and completing adventures. When a 1st-level
character accumulates a total of 1,000 XP, he or she advances to 2nd level.
To reach 3rd level, a character needs to accumulate 3,000 XP, and so on, as
shown on Table 3-2 in the Player’s Handbook.
A character’s level provides other benefits and essential information, as
described in the next few sections.
Class skill maximum ranks
Your character selects skills from a list that’s specifically geared toward a par-
ticular class. Any skills you select from your character’s class list are called
class skills. The number of ranks you can spend skill points on for any given
class skill is determined by your level, as shown on Table 3-2 in the Player’s
Handbook. The rule is easy to remember, though. The maximum number of
ranks you can have in a class skill is equal to your character’s level +3.
For example, at 1st level, Regdar can buy a maximum of 4 ranks in any of his
class skills. (For more on skills and skill ranks, see Chapter 15.)
Cross-class skill maximum ranks
Any skill not featured on your character’s class skills list is considered to be a
cross-class skill. Cross-class skills cost twice as many skill points to buy as
class skills. The number of ranks you can spend skill points on for any given
cross-class skill is determined by your character’s level, as shown on Table 3-2
in the Player’s Handbook. The maximum number of ranks you can buy in a
cross-class skill is equal to one-half your maximum for class skills.
For example, at 1st level, Regdar can buy a maximum of 2 ranks in any cross-
class skill. These 2 ranks would cost the same as buying 4 ranks in a class skill.
(For more on cross-class skills, see Chapter 15.)
123
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

Feats
Characters gain feats according to level. All characters start with one feat at
1st level. Each character can select a new feat every time he or she attains a
level divisible by three. That means that Regdar selects new feats at 3rd, 6th,
9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level, for example, as shown on Table 3-2 in the
Player’s Handbook. 
These feats are given to every character, regardless of class. However, class
features may provide additional feats at different levels; these are called bonus
feats. (For more on feats, see Chapter 14.)
Ability score increases
Characters increase their ability scores as they advance in level. A character
can increase any single ability score by 1 point every time he or she attains a
level divisible by four. That means that Lidda increases one of her ability scores
by 1 point at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level, for example, as shown on
Table 3-2 in the Player’s Handbook. So, upon achieving 4th level, Lidda could
increase her Dexterity score from 17 to 18. (For more on ability scores, see
Chapter 12.)
Class Descriptions
Each class description in the Player’s Handbook provides key information about
the class. Where should you put your best ability scores? What alignment can
your character select as a member of this class? What Hit Die do members of
this class use to determine their hit points? What base attack and base save
progressions does the class use? What skills are considered to be class skills
for characters that select this class? What weapons and armor can charac-
ters with this class use without penalty? What spells, if any, are available to
this class? What other unique capabilities do members of this class possess?
All these questions are covered in the class descriptions. In the rest of this
chapter, we explore some of the answers as they relate to four of the classes —
fighter, rogue, sorcerer, and cleric — so that you can decide which one you
want to play.
The fighter is the best class
Characters of the fighter class have the best all-around fighting capabilities.
Deciding to play a fighter means that your character is going to have a lot of
hit points for his or her level, good attack scores, good damage capabilities,
and a direct approach to game play. That makes the fighter class particularly
attractive to new players and players that don’t want to deal with the intrica-
cies of spellcasting and skill use.
124
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The fighter’s job in any adventuring group is to be a frontline combatant. Good
armor and high hit points make a fighter a tank, able to absorb punishment
that other characters have little hope of withstanding for very long. Good
attacks and high damage potential make a fighter the character best suited to
take the battle right to the monsters.
Fighters can select any alignment. All races have fighters, so a fighter character
can be created using any of the D&D races. Of the races described in this book,
humans and dwarves make the strongest melee-oriented fighters. Elves and
halflings can be powerful ranged fighters, due to their Dexterity adjustments.
(See Chapter 13 for more on races.)
Fighters get a lot of bonus feats to choose from, as well as bonus feat slots at
different levels to take advantage of that. Fighters are proficient in all simple
and martial weapons, as well as in all armor types, which makes them very
versatile as far as adventuring gear goes.
Fighters start out with 6d4 × 10 gold pieces. Buy the best armor and weapons
you can afford to take full advantage of the fighter’s built-in benefits.
The Player’s Handbook offers additional player character races. Of the addi-
tional races, the half-orc really takes to the fighter class thanks to his or her
Strength adjustment. If you want to play a powerful melee-oriented fighter,
you might want to consider playing a half-orc.
Abilities
If you decide to play a fighter, you should consider putting your highest 
ability score in Strength. Strength modifies both melee attacks and damage,
and that’s usually where fighters want to excel. Other important abilities for
fighters include Constitution, which modifies the fighter’s hit point total, and
Dexterity, which modifies the fighter’s ranged attacks and Armor Class.
Hit Die
The fighter uses a d10 Hit Die. This means that at 1st level, a fighter has 10 hit
points (modified by his or her Constitution score). Every level thereafter, the
fighter rolls d10 and adds his or her Constitution modifier to determine a new
hit point total.
If you like to play a character with a lot of hit points, you can’t do much
better than the fighter class.
Skills
You won’t be playing a scholar when you play a fighter. Fighters have a small
selection of class skills and a small amount of skill points to use every level.
A fighter begins play with (2 + Intelligence modifier) × 4 skill points. At 2nd
level and every level thereafter, a fighter gains 2 + Intelligence modifier skill
points to spend to improve existing skills or to buy new ones.
125
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

Because the fighter has such a limited number of skill points to spend, you
don’t want to try to dabble in a lot of different skills. Select a couple of key
skills that you think you want your character to be good at, and spend your
skill points on just those skills at every opportunity. 
The class skills most important to a fighter are Climb, Jump, and Intimidate.
The cross-class skill you might want to consider putting ranks in is Spot,
because it helps you notice clues and avoid surprises. In the dangerous
worlds of D&D, that’s always a good thing.
See Chapter 15 for more information on skills.
Fighter class features
As befits the easiest class to play, the fighter has very few special class fea-
tures. What the fighter does have is a good base attack bonus that increases
by 1 point every level, good Fortitude saves, the ability to use any armor and
any simple and martial weapons without penalty (and without spending a
precious feat), and a ton of bonus feats that help to enhance the class’s nat-
ural combat capabilities.
The rogue is the best class
Selecting the rogue class is the smartest thing you can do if you want to play a
character that relies on skills, stealth, and sneak attacks to get to the center
of a dungeon and back again. Rogues come in all kinds of varieties, from the
smuggler with a heart of gold to the expert spy who uses craftiness and a silver
tongue to accomplish the nearly impossible. If you pick this class, you will be
able to hold your own in combat, especially if you can attack from a distance
or out of the shadows. The rogue has a few special abilities that make the class
slightly more complex than the fighter, but without the added complications
of spellcasting.
The rogue’s job in any adventuring group is to be versatile and resourceful.
A rogue usually has a trick up his or her sleeve to get the team out of any
jam. Need a lock opened? Need a trap disarmed? Need to sneak past the
sleeping dragon? The rogue is the character for the job. When it comes to
combat, a rogue prefers to make opportunistic strikes from the shadows or
to use a ranged weapon that keeps his or her body out of harm’s way. And,
while not capable of casting spells from memory like a sorcerer, a rogue can
use the Use Magic Device skill to cast spells from scrolls or use just about
any kind of magic item if the party needs that kind of assistance.
Rogues can select any alignment, though they tend to avoid lawful outlooks
on life. All races have rogues, so a rogue character can be created using any
of the D&D races. Of the races described in this book, halflings and elves make
126
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

the best rogues due to their Dexterity adjustments. Humans also make decent
rogues, especially because of the extra skill points that human characters
receive every level. (See Chapter 13 for more on races.)
Rogues are proficient in all simple weapons and light armor, as well as with
hand crossbows, rapiers, shortbows, and short swords. Rogues don’t do well
with heavier armor and shields, and they are penalized for using such items
in the course of an adventure.
Rogues start out with 5d4 × 10 gold pieces. Buy some leather armor, a short
sword, a light crossbow, and thieves’ tools as soon as you are able.
The Player’s Handbook offers additional player character races. Of the addi-
tional races, the half-elf can make a very good rogue due to the racial bonuses
he or she receives to the Diplomacy, Gather Information, Listen, Search, and
Spot skills.
Abilities
If you decide to play a rogue, you should consider putting your highest ability
score in Dexterity. Dexterity modifies many of the rogue’s signature skills, as
well as Armor Class and ranged attacks. Other important abilities for rogues
include Intelligence, which modifies the rogue’s skill point total, and Wisdom,
which modifies many of the skills the rogue wants to use on a regular basis.
Hit Die
The rogue uses a d6 Hit Die. This means that at 1st level, a rogue has 6 hit
points (modified by his or her Constitution score). Every level thereafter, the
rogue rolls d6 and adds his or her Constitution modifier to determine a new
hit point total.
Skills
The rogue has the most class skills of all the player character races presented
in the Player’s Handbook. To take advantage of all those skill options, the
rogue also has the most skill points. A rogue begins play with (8 + Intelligence
modifier) × 4 skill points. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, a rogue gains
8 + Intelligence modifier skill points to spend to improve existing skills or buy
new ones.
Because the rogue has such a large number of skill points to spend, you can
keep strong scores in a relatively large number of skills. Even so, your charac-
ter will never have enough points to be good at everything. Decide what kind
of rogue you want to play, and concentrate on the skills that will enhance that
character. It’s always better to put as many ranks into key skills as possible —
more ranks means a better chance to succeed, and the rogue never wants to
be caught short using a skill that could mean life or death for the party.
127
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

The class skills most important to a rogue depend on what kind of rogue you
want to play. Want to be a thief? Concentrate on improving Hide, Move Silently,
Open Lock, and Search. Want to deal with the hazards of the dungeon? Spend
your skill points on Balance, Climb, Disable Device, Listen, Open Lock, and
Spot. Want your rogue to be the silver-tongued diplomat in the group? Then
focus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense
Motive.
Two additional skills to consider as you build your rogue are Tumble and Use
Magic Device. Tumble provides a rogue with the ability to take less damage
from a fall and to roll through enemy-occupied squares or threatened squares
where the character would otherwise be subject to an attack of opportunity.
You still have to make a successful skill check, but the character has options
not available to anyone else in the party. Use Magic Device provides a rogue
with the chance of activating magic devices, such as scrolls and wands, which
a character with a non-spellcasting class usually doesn’t have. Buy ranks in
this skill if you want your rogue to back up the sorcerer in the party. You never
know when the rogue might be the last character standing and his or her abil-
ity to activate a scroll might be all that stands between the adventurers and
certain defeat.
As far as cross-class skills go, you might want to consider spending some of the
rogue’s wealth of skill points on Knowledge skills. A lot of useful information
can be gained by making successful Knowledge checks at the appropriate
moments, and you might want your rogue to know a thing or two about arcane
lore or dungeoneering.
If you like to play a character with a lot of skill points and a lot of class skills
to spend them on, you can’t do better than the rogue class.
See Chapter 15 for more information on skills.
Rogue class features
In addition to being highly skilled, a rogue has a sixth sense for avoiding danger.
As a rogue advances in level, the class provides a number of danger-avoiding
abilities that give the rogue a definite edge when it comes to adventuring.
These include trapfinding (the ability to search for mundane and magical traps),
evasion (which improves the benefit of successful Reflex saves), trap sense
(an intuitive alarm that provides a bonus to Reflex saves and Armor Class
when used to avoid traps), and uncanny dodge (an ability that allows a rogue
to retain his or her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when surprised or
caught flat-footed). These features are gained automatically at specific rogue
levels, and many of them improve at even higher levels.
The rogue is naturally a master of sneak attacks (attacks made from hiding
or when the rogue’s opponent has his or her attention focused elsewhere).
At 1st level, a successful sneak attack increases the amount of damage the
rogue’s weapon deals by 1d6 points. In addition to rolling a weapon’s normal
damage, you roll a six-sided die. This extra damage increases as the rogue gains
128
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

levels. At 3rd level, for example, a rogue’s sneak attack added damage is +2d6.
It continues to improve, every other level, until it hits +10d6 at 19th level!
The sorcerer is the best class
You want to select the sorcerer class for your character if you want to play an
arcane spellcaster. If calling forth magical energy, shaping it into powerful spells,
and unleashing those spells upon monsters and other opponents appeals to
your sense of play, then the sorcerer class is the one for you. A sorcerer’s spell
selection helps define his or her role in the party, and the class has few spe-
cial features beyond the ability to cast arcane spells. That ability, however,
provides the class with a huge advantage that allows characters who go this
route to shine.
The sorcerer’s job in any adventuring group is to cast arcane spells. Want to
be an offensive powerhouse? Select spells that deal damage. Want to be subtle
in your spellcasting? Choose spells such as charms and illusions. In addition,
because the sorcerer usually has a high Charisma score, a character with this
class often serves as the spokesperson for the adventuring party. Using spells
to complement their natural talents allows sorcerers to gain information and
influence others better than almost anyone. 
Sorcerers can select any alignment, though they tend to favor chaos over law
due to the way in which they approach spellcasting. All races have sorcerers,
so a sorcerer character can be created using any of the D&D races. Of the races
described in this book, elves make the best sorcerers due to their natural
inclination toward magic. Humans also make good sorcerers. (See Chapter 13
for more on races.)
Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They aren’t proficient with
any armor types or shields, and armor actually interferes with their ability to
cast spells.
Sorcerers start out with 3d4 × 10 gold pieces. Pick up the best simple weapons
you can afford, both a melee weapon (for up-close combat) and a ranged
weapon. Because you don’t need to purchase armor, you might want to con-
sider buying some of the adventuring gear the party as a whole would benefit
from, such as rope and a lantern. You should also consider paying the cost to
summon a familiar at the first opportunity (see the later section, “Sorcerer class
features”). And don’t forget to buy a pouch to carry your spell components in.
The Player’s Handbook offers a second arcane spellcasting class: the wizard.
Where the sorcerer approaches spellcasting more as an art than a science,
working through intuition rather than careful training and study, the wizard is
all about research. For this reason, the wizard has a wider selection of spells to
call upon, whereas the sorcerer tends to be a specialist. As such, the sorcerer
is slightly easier to play. That’s why we discuss the sorcerer class in this book
instead of the wizard.
129
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

Abilities
If you decide to play a sorcerer, you should consider putting your highest abil-
ity score in Charisma. Charisma determines the level of power of the spells
you cast, how many spells you can cast per day, and how difficult those spells
are to resist. See Chapter 17 for more about spells and spellcasting.
Other important abilities for sorcerers include Dexterity, which modifies the
sorcerer’s Armor Class and ranged weapon attacks, and Constitution, which
modifies the number of hit points the sorcerer gains each level and helps
improve important Concentration skill checks.
Hit Die
The sorcerer uses a d4 Hit Die. This means that at 1st level, a sorcerer has
4 hit points (modified by his or her Constitution score). Every level thereafter,
the sorcerer rolls a d4 and adds his or her Constitution modifier to determine
a new hit point total.
The sorcerer, compared to the other classes, doesn’t have a lot of hit points.
A character with this class doesn’t want to get into a prolonged melee battle
with any monster. The best way to play a sorcerer during a battle is to stand
back, use spells to attack or otherwise aid the party, and then switch to a
ranged weapon and attack from a distance. The sorcerer is just too fragile,
due to low hit points and Armor Class, to stand toe-to-toe with monsters the
way the fighter or cleric does.
If you’re playing a sorcerer character, you might want to consider selecting the
Toughness feat. Every time you take this feat (and it can be taken as many times
as you like, each time you can select a new feat), you add 3 hit points to your
hit point total. Check out the ready-to-play version of Wellyn in Chapter 5. He
has a total of 8 hit points thanks to his Hit Die (d4), his Constitution modifier
(+1), and the Toughness feat (+3). That makes him twice as hard to defeat as
he would have been if he had settled for just the hit points provided by his
Hit Die.
Skills
The sorcerer has a very small selection of class skills and skill points. Training
and education just aren’t the sorcerer’s approach to the world. A sorcerer
begins play with (2 + Intelligence modifier) × 4 skill points. At 2nd level and
every level thereafter, a sorcerer gains 2 + Intelligence modifier skill points to
spend to improve existing skills or buy new ones.
Because the sorcerer has such a limited number of skill points to spend, you
don’t want to try to dabble in a lot of different skills. Select a couple of key
skills that you think you want your character to be good at, and spend your
skill points on just those skills at every opportunity. 
130
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The class skills most important to a sorcerer are Concentration, Knowledge
(arcana), and Spellcraft. Concentration helps a sorcerer complete the casting
of a spell even if he or she is interrupted by an attack. Knowledge (arcana)
helps a sorcerer understand arcane spells and other magical knowledge.
Spellcraft, a special skill only available to classes that cast spells, allows a
character to identify spells and magical effects as they are cast. The cross-class
skills you might want to consider putting ranks in are any of the Charisma-
based skills, so you can take advantage of that ability’s modifier.
See Chapter 15 for more information on skills.
Sorcerer class features
Sorcerers cast arcane spells. What gives sorcerers the edge is that they can
cast any spell they know without the need for preparation. This is different
from the way the cleric or wizard casts spells, and it gives the sorcerer a lot of
flexibility when it comes to casting spells. Sorcerers get more spells to cast per
day than a wizard, but conversely have a smaller pool of known spells to draw
from. For this reason, you need to very carefully select the spells that your
character knows. Look to collect spells that complement each other or play
to other strengths the character has. It helps if you determine what kind of
sorcerer you want to play. The offense-oriented sorcerer looks for spells that
pack a lot of damage, while the sorcerer who decides to play to his or her
Charisma-based skills looks to add illusions and charms to his or her reper-
toire of spells.
The sorcerer also has the ability to summon a familiar at any time, starting as
early as 1st level. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small, mun-
dane animal, but is unusually tough and intelligent. In addition to the animal’s
normal abilities, it becomes magically linked to its summoner and grants spe-
cial abilities, such as bonuses to skill checks or saves, or extra hit points. The
two relevant costs associated with summoning a familiar are time (24 hours)
and magical materials (worth 100 gold pieces). 
Page 52 of the Player’s Handbook provides a list of familiars and the benefits
they provide. Choose the animal you want, spend the time and money, and
then take advantage of the benefits that a familiar provides.
The cleric is the best class
The cleric is the class for you if you want to play a character that has a 
profound connection to a higher power. With divine spells, decent combat
prowess, and the ability to repel undead monsters, the cleric combines 
elements of spellcasting and martial skills to bolster any adventuring group.
The cleric’s spells revolve around healing damage and enhancing the abilities
of other party members. These enhancements, commonly called buffs, allow
the cleric to make everybody around him or her better.
131
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

The cleric’s job in any adventuring group is to cast divine spells that provide
healing, defense, and secret knowledge from on high. By casting spells on his
or her teammates, a cleric can make a fighter more powerful, a rogue more
effective, and a sorcerer more charismatic. Thanks to solid armor and weapons
options, the cleric makes a good secondary combat character, able to provide
support for the frontline fighter.
A cleric can select any alignment, as long as that alignment coincides with
that of the deity the character serves. All races have clerics, so a cleric char-
acter can be created using any of the D&D races. Of the races described in
this book, humans and dwarves make the best clerics. (See Chapter 13 for
more on races.)
Clerics are trained to use all simple weapons, all types of armor, and most
types of shields. Divine magic isn’t adversely affected by armor the same way
that arcane magic is, so the cleric can benefit from the protection of the best
armor he or she can afford.
Clerics start out with 5d4 × 10 gold pieces. Pick up the best simple weapons
you can afford, both a melee weapon (for up-close combat) and a ranged
weapon. Because clerics can use any kind of armor, buy the best armor your
character can afford and wear it proudly. You also need to purchase a holy
symbol for your character to channel the power of his or her faith for the
purposes of turning (or repelling) undead creatures.
The Player’s Handbook features a selection of sample deities that can be used
in any D&D campaign world. You can find these starting on page 106. Pick a
deity for your cleric that corresponds with your character’s alignment and
race. Remember that, as a cleric, your character gains domain spells and
favored weapons based on your choice of a deity.
Abilities
If you decide to play a cleric, you should consider putting your highest ability
score in Wisdom. Wisdom determines the level of power of the spells you cast,
how many spells you can cast per day, and how difficult those spells are to
resist. See Chapter 17 for more about spells and spellcasting.
Other important abilities for clerics include Constitution, which modifies the
number of hit points clerics gain at each level, and Charisma, which improves
their ability to turn undead creatures.
Hit Die
The cleric uses a d8 Hit Die. This means that at 1st level, a cleric has 8 hit
points (modified by his or her Constitution score). Every level thereafter, the
cleric rolls a d8 and adds his or her Constitution modifier to determine a new
hit point total.
132
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Skills
The cleric has a small selection of class skills and a very small amount of skill
points. A cleric begins play with (2 + Intelligence modifier) × 4 skill points. At
2nd level and every level thereafter, a cleric gains 2 + Intelligence modifier
skill points to spend to improve existing skills or buy new ones.
Because the cleric has such a limited number of skill points to spend, you
don’t want to try to dabble in a lot of different skills. Select a couple of key
skills that you think you want your character to be good at, and spend your
skill points on just those skills at every opportunity. 
The class skills most important to a cleric are Concentration, Diplomacy, and
Heal. Concentration helps a cleric complete the casting of a spell even if he or
she is interrupted by an attack. Diplomacy takes advantage of a cleric’s good
Charisma modifier to negotiate effectively and influence others. Heal supple-
ments clerics’ magical healing powers with mundane medical skill, allowing
clerics to help hurt allies even if they have expended their daily allotment of
spells. Clerics also gain additional class skills based on the domains associated
with their deities. A cleric that chooses the Travel domain adds the Survival
skill to his or her class skill list, for example.
See Chapter 15 for more information on skills.
Cleric class features
Clerics cast divine spells. Divine spells come from a higher power, a deity
that your cleric has chosen to follow. When you select the cleric class, you
must pick a deity. This fantasy god has a selection of associated domains.
Choose two of the deity’s associated domains. These domains provide bonus
spells and granted powers that come to the cleric from on high. You’ll find
details on deities and domains in Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook.
Clerics must prepare their spells in advance. This means that you must choose
the spells you want to have available for your character to cast at the begin-
ning of a day, before the cleric goes adventuring. In game terms, clerics spend
one hour in daily meditation, filling themselves with divine energy that can
be expelled at will as a prepared spell. As a player, you record one spell for
each open spell slot you have on your character sheet or scrap paper. When
your character casts a spell (and uses up a spell slot), cross off that spell in
your list of preselected spells. 
A cleric with a good or neutral alignment can use stored spell energy to cast a
healing spell in place of a previously prepared spell. This means that a cleric
never has to prepare healing spells; he or she can spontaneously cast a heal-
ing spell of the same level (or lower) as any prepared spell on his or her list.
To do so, the cleric loses the prepared spell for the day and instead casts a
healing spell of the same level (or lower). Jerek, for example, can decide to
lose his prepared magic weapon spell and instead cast a cure light wounds on
an injured companion.
133
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

A cleric can’t cast a spontaneous healing spell in place of a domain spell,
however.
The other class feature that clerics benefit from is the ability to turn undead.
By channeling the power of their faith through their holy symbols, clerics can
repel undead creatures. At higher levels, clerics can even destroy undead
through the power of their faith. Clerics can attempt to turn undead a number
of times per day equal to their Charisma modifier plus three. A cleric with a +1
Charisma modifier, for example, can make four turn undead attempts each day.
Other classes
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game features 11 core classes. We concentrate on
the four most basic classes for this book, but you should know that there are
other choices available. Chapter 3 in the Player’s Handbook details all of these
classes. Here’s a brief rundown so you know what else is out there:
 Barbarian, paladin, and ranger: These are the combat-oriented classes
that can take on the same roles as the fighter. 
 Bard and monk: These are the classes that can fill some of the same
roles as the rogue.
 Wizard: This is the arcane spellcasting class other than the sorcerer.
 Druid: This is the divine spellcasting class other than the cleric.
When you’re ready for a bigger challenge, or when you just want to try some-
thing different, take a look at these classes in the Player’s Handbook.
134
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Bring what your friends need
If you don’t have a clear idea about the type of
character you want to play, or if it doesn’t really
matter too much to you, then take a look at what
types of characters the other players are creating
and work to fill the holes. Does your party need
a frontline combat specialist? Consider creating
a fighter. Is the party lacking in spellcasting?
Think about playing either a sorcerer or cleric.
No one else going for the rogue? Get in there
and make a rogue to be proud of. An adventuring
party is a team, and a team needs a variety of
skills and abilities. When nothing else suggests
itself, look for a way to shore up your team’s
chances by creating a character that fills a gap
or provides a desperately needed ability.

E
very DUNGEONS & DRAGONS character — on paper, at least — consists of a
number of key statistics that begin with a character’s ability scores.
Class, race, and equipment help to refine and develop a character concept, but
when you create a new character, you begin by determining that character’s
ability scores. The Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide describe a
variety of methods for generating ability scores. We discuss two methods for
determining ability scores in this chapter: the random generation method
and the elite array.
In this chapter, we examine what the ability scores are used for and how to gen-
erate the best scores for the character you want to create. We also talk about
what to do when the dice don’t roll exactly in your favor. Afterward, we look
at the choices available and help you best assign ability scores to make the
character you envision — or at least make the character viable and fun to play.
You can find out more about ability scores and ability score generation meth-
ods in Chapter 1 of the Player’s Handbook and Chapter 6 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.

How the Ability Scores Work
Each character has six abilities — Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma. Ability scores rate a character, painting a broad picture of
how strong, dexterous, and intelligent (and so on) that character is. Ability
scores form the foundation upon which a character of myth and legend grows.
A character has six abilities. Three are physical abilities and three are mental
abilities, as follows:
 Strength (Str): This score gauges your character’s physical might. How
much equipment can he or she carry? Can he or she force open a heavy
door? Arm-wrestle a bugbear? Swing a greatsword? Bash open a locked
chest? A strong character is better at melee combat than a weaker one.
A character with the fighter class wants a high score in this ability.
 Dexterity (Dex): This score measures your character’s reflexes and agility.
How good is he or she with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or bow?
Can he or she use speed and coordination to avoid being hit and taking
damage? Can he or she use skills that require a great deal of hand-eye
coordination? A dexterous character is better at ranged combat than a
less agile one and has a better Armor Class (AC) thanks to quick reactions.
A character with the rogue class wants a high score in this ability.
 Constitution (Con): This number expresses your character’s overall
physical health and stamina. How long can he or she hold his or her
breath? How well does his or her body deal with physical damage? How
much punishment can he or she take before falling unconscious? These
are the types of things measured by your character’s Constitution score.
All characters want at least a minor bonus from this ability because of
its bonus to hit points.
 Intelligence (Int): This score gauges your character’s ability to learn and
use deductive reasoning. How many languages does your character know?
Can he or she disarm the trap without setting it off? What does your
character know about the monster he or she is facing? The history of
the dungeon? The uses for the arcane ingredients found in the necro-
mancer’s vault? A smart character is better at finding answers than a
less intelligent one.
 Wisdom (Wis): This score measures your character’s perception and
willpower. Does he or she notice the gnolls lurking in the shadows?
Can he or she hear the dragon breathing in the dark cave ahead? Does
he or she have the strength of will to withstand the vampire’s hypnotic
gaze? A wise character is better at taking advantage of insight and intu-
ition than a less wise character would be. A high score also provides a
136
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

cleric with bonus spells. A character with the cleric class wants a high
score in this ability.
 Charisma (Cha): This number represents your character’s personal 
magnetism and physical attractiveness. Can he or she get the castle
guard to look the other way with convincing words or a well-timed
bribe? A charismatic character is better at being suave or subtle when
the situation calls for it than a less charismatic one is. A high score also
provides a sorcerer with bonus spells and helps determine what level
of spells a sorcerer can cast. For these reasons, a character with the 
sorcerer class wants a high score in this ability.
When you create a character, you generate ability scores and assign them to
the abilities as you see fit. How you assign the scores depends on what kind of
character you’re creating. If you’re making a sorcerer, for example, you would
assign a high score to Charisma, whereas if you’re making a fighter, you would
assign a high score to Strength. (See Table 12-2, later in this chapter, for more
information.)
An average score is 10 or 11. Scores of less than 10 are below average, while
scores of 12 or better are above average. In general, ability scores range from
8 to 18 when you first create the character. The score provides a modifier,
either a bonus or a penalty that is tied to certain types of actions in the game,
as described in Table 12-1. In general, ability scores relate to actions in the
following way:
 Low ability scores (9 and lower) provide penalties to actions they are
associated with.
 High ability scores (12 and higher) provide bonuses to actions they are
associated with.

Chapter 12: Figuring Out Your Character’s Ability Scores

Remember the Core Game Mechanic (described in Chapter 1):
 Roll a d20
 Add a modifier (bonus or penalty)
 Compare the result to a target number
So bonuses (such as +1) are always better, because they help make your d20
result higher and increase the chance of success at a given action. Penalties
(such as –1) lower your d20 result and make the chance of failure more likely.
A low score in a physical ability means that the character faces difficult 
challenges as a front-line warrior; a high score, on the other hand, doesn’t
guarantee success in that field.
In the following list, we describe each of the six abilities and their effects on
character actions in the game:
 Strength (Str): The modifier provided by the character’s Strength score
is applied to melee attacks, damage rolls, and physical skill scores
(Climb, Jump, and Swim).
 Dexterity (Dex): The modifier provided by the character’s Dexterity score
is applied to ranged attacks, Reflex saving throws, the character’s AC, and
to Dexterity-based skill scores (such as Balance, Open Lock, and Tumble).
 Constitution (Con): The modifier provided by the character’s Constitution
score is applied to his or her Hit Die to determine the character’s hit
points (hp) every time he or she gains a level. The Constitution modifier
also applies to Fortitude saving throws and the Concentration skill score
(which is important to spellcasters such as the sorcerer and cleric).
 Intelligence (Int): The modifier provided by the character’s Intelligence
score is applied to the number of languages he or she can know as a 1st-
level character, the number of skill points he or she gains at every level,
and to Intelligence-based skill scores (such as Disable Device, Knowledge,
Search, and Spellcraft).
 Wisdom (Wis): The modifier provided by the character’s Wisdom score
is applied to Will saving throws and Wisdom-based skill scores (such as
Listen, Spot, and Survival).
 Charisma (Cha): The modifier provided by the character’s Charisma score
is applied to Charisma-based skill scores (such as Bluff, Diplomacy, and
Intimidate) and to a cleric’s checks to turn undead creatures.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Generating Ability Scores
Some people approach the game knowing exactly what kind of character they
want to create and play. Others prefer to generate their ability scores first, see
what they get in the way of bonuses and penalties, and then create the best
character they can around those scores. Either way, at some point early in
the process, you need to figure out what your character’s ability scores are.
Check with your Dungeon Master to see if he or she has a preferred method
for determining ability scores. In this section, we examine the two most 
popular methods — the random generation method and the elite array —
and discuss how to get the most out of them when creating a new DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS player character.
The random method
D&D is a game of dice rolling. It’s no wonder, then, that most D&D players
create their characters by rolling ability scores randomly. The Player’s
Handbook describes this method in detail. There’s just something about
rolling dice that gets the blood pumping. It’s exciting to see what happens.
This method provides a chance for the highest scores possible — as well
as for the lowest. It all depends on luck and how the dice fall.
With this method, you can generate scores between 3 and 18. This means that
it’s possible to do much better or much worse than by using the elite array
to generate your character’s ability scores. Of course, that’s what makes this
method so appealing. When the dice fall right, you can create a character that
might have a score of 16, 17, or even 18. When the dice fall badly, though, you
could wind up with a score of less than 8, and that’s not good.
This method for generating ability scores has some safeguards built in. If you
roll really poorly, for example, established rules allow you to scrap your results
and roll again. This is detailed under the “Rerolling” section in the Player’s
Handbook. The game defines a poor set of rolls as follows:
 The sum of the ability modifiers is 0 or lower.
or
 The highest score is 13 or lower.
So don’t let the randomness of this method scare you. Instead, embrace the
excitement of watching the dice fall and hope for some really high scores!
139
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Your Character’s Ability Scores

To use the random method to generate six scores and assign those scores to
your character’s abilities, follow these steps:
1. Roll four six-sided dice (4d6). Discard the die with the lowest roll. Total
the three remaining dice. Jot down the number. (You’ll wind up with
a number between 3 and 18.)
For example, you might roll 4 and 5 and 3 and 3. You discard one of the
3s and add the others. Your total for this roll is 12.
2. Repeat five more times.
Suppose that you get the following results:
4 and 5 and 3 and 3 = 12
5 and 6 and 6 and 4 = 17
5 and 6 and 5 and 2 = 16
5 and 4 and 4 and 4 = 13
3 and 4 and 4 and 1 = 11
3 and 2 and 4 and 3 = 10
3. Assign each score to one ability, pairing up number and ability to best
create the kind of character you want to develop.
For instance, if you want to make a character with the fighter class, you
could assign the example scores as follows:
Str 17, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 12
By placing the best score in Strength, you create a very strong fighter
with a +3 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls. The second highest
score goes in Constitution to pile on the hit points the character gets at
every level. You place small bonuses of +1 in Dexterity to improve your
character’s Armor Class (AC) and Charisma, leaving you with two aver-
age scores to plug into the remaining mental statistics of Intelligence
and Wisdom. No bonus for these stats, but no penalty, either.
If you were looking to make a sorcerer, you might assign the example
scores this way:
Str 10, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 17
Placing the best score in Charisma gives your sorcerer a distinct advan-
tage as far as spellcasting is concerned, as this is the ability that governs
bonus spells and maximum spell level for this class. Because Constitution
grants extra hit points and factors into important Concentration skill
checks, you opt to place the second highest score here. Small bonuses
go into Dexterity and Intelligence to improve your character’s AC and
give him or her extra skill points. This just leaves the average scores,
which provide neither a bonus nor a penalty. You slot them into Strength
(because you don’t plan on having your sorcerer get up close and personal
during combat) and Wisdom (the character can be charismatic and smart,
but you decide that the character isn’t especially perceptive or wise).
140
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The elite array
The potential highs and lows of the random method make it the method
of choice for most Dungeon Masters and players, and that’s why it was 
set up as the default method for generating ability scores in the Player’s
Handbook. We like this method best and recommend that you use it unless
you have a very specific character concept in mind and would feel better
having a little more control over the results. That’s where the elite array
comes in.
This method of ability score generation provides a solid group of set 
numbers that you can assign as you see fit. That’s right — the elite array
always uses the same numbers. You have more control with this method
because you always know exactly what scores you’re going to get. The 
dizzying heights or the disappointing lows that you get with random 
rolling are not part of this method, and that’s kind of the point. The elite
array provides a set of numbers that combines decent bonuses with one
average score and one penalty thrown in for good measure. The elite array
looks like this:
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8
The benefits of using the elite array are speed and consistency. This set of
scores allows you to quickly create a character that has at least a decent
score (a score that produces a bonus) in every ability important to the
class you want to play. The disadvantages are that you don’t have the 
possibility of generating a score of 16 or higher (as you can, if you’re lucky,
with the random method) and that you lose out on the excitement of rolling
the dice.
When you’re in a hurry or when you want to guarantee a selection of
bonuses so you can better create the character concept you’ve got in mind,
go with the elite array. We used the elite array to create all of the ready-to-
play characters in Part I.
Assigning Ability Scores by Class
For every class, certain abilities are more important than others and provide a
key to a character’s success. We define these important abilities for each class
in Table 12-2. For each class, we show where to place the highest score (++),
the other bonus-generating or average scores (+), and the penalty-generating
scores (–). The fighter is presented as having either a melee or a ranged combat
focus. In addition to the standard cleric, we present a cleric with a melee focus
to round out that class. You see examples of these different types of fighters
and clerics in Chapter 3 and 6.

Chapter 13
Picking a Race
In This Chapter
 Examining the fantasy races
 Picking the right race for the job
 Checking out other race options
N
o fantasy world is complete without a selection of mythical races to
join humans in the struggle against monsters and Evil with a capital
“E.” These distinct races usually have their own homelands, but everyone
comes together in the larger human towns and cities. There, those with
adventurous spirits join up and head out to banish threats and undertake
quests that might be personal or world-altering in nature.
In this chapter, we look at the fantasy races available for use as player char-
acters in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. We concentrate on four of those
races — humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings — discussing the benefits
each brings to the table and why you’d want to play a character of that race.
You can play any race and class option you want, but keep in mind that some
races are predisposed to perform better in certain classes, as discussed in
this chapter.

At the end of the chapter, we provide a quick overview of other races avail-
able in the D&D game.
Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook goes into greater depth on character
races and the benefits and disadvantages of each. Check it out after you read
through this chapter. 
Humans
Humans in D&D worlds are more or less just like humans in the real world,
except stronger, more heroic and daring, and usually better looking. They
come in all the usual human shapes, sizes, and colors. They range in height
from about 5 feet to just over 6 feet tall. They reach adventuring age somewhere
between their 16th and 20th birthdays. Human adventurers are adaptable,
flexible, and extremely ambitious. They tend toward no particular alignment
or deity, and they have a habit of championing causes and ideals over people
or places. 
Play a human character if you want to have a lot of maneuverability for your
character as he or she advances in level. Although humans don’t get any spe-
cial abilities or statistical adjustments, they do gain extra skill points and an
extra feat to reflect their racial tendency toward versatility and capability at
mastering new tasks.
Ability adjustments
Human characters get no ability adjustments. Assign the ability scores you
generated to specific abilities and you’re done.
Special traits
Humans start play with one extra feat at 1st level, and 4 extra skill points
at 1st level. With every level gained, a human character gets 1 extra skill
point.
Best class
Humans do equally well with all of the classes, and they are suited to be good
at any adventuring careers they set their minds to. 
144
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Dwarves
Dwarves are short and extremely broad, standing about 4 feet tall and weigh-
ing about the same as much taller humans. Hailing from vast underground
or mountainous kingdoms, dwarves excel at warfare, mining, and construc-
tion. Longer lived than humans, dwarves have great patience and take
pride in hard work done well. Dwarf adventurers tend to be lawful (and 
usually good) in their alignment, seeking quests that will bring honor to
their clans, respect from their friends, and treasure beyond their wildest
imaginings.
Play a dwarf character if you want to focus on combat. Dwarves also have
special abilities that favor underground and dungeon adventuring, such as
the ability to see in the dark. If courage, loyalty, and a love of strong ale
appeal to your sense of heroics, the dwarf race is a good choice for you.
Ability adjustments
After you’ve assigned the ability scores you generated to your abilities, make
the following adjustments:
 Add 2 points to your Constitution score. Dwarves are stout and tough.
 Subtract 2 points from your Charisma score. Dwarves are gruff and
reserved.
Special traits
Dwarves have the following racial traits:
 Due to their size and build, dwarves have a base speed of 20 feet
(4 squares). However, they retain this speed even when wearing
medium or heavy armor, or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
145
Chapter 13: Picking a Race
A word about gender
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS characters can be either
male or female. Playing a male or female charac-
ter is a personal choice, and to keep it that way,
the game sees no difference in characters of
different genders. In D&D worlds, female adven-
turers are the equals of their male counterparts. 

 Dwarves have darkvision, which allows them to see up to 60 feet in
the dark.
 Dwarves gain a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual
stonework.
 Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes as martial weapons, rather than exotic
weapons.
 Dwarves are extremely stable. They gain a +4 bonus on ability checks to
resist bull rushes and trip attacks.
 Dwarves are hardy. They receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws
against poisons.
 Dwarves have an innate resistance to magic spells. They receive a 
+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.
 Due to special training, dwarves gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls
against orcs and goblinoids.
 Due to special training, dwarves gain a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class
when fighting giants (including ogres, trolls, and hill giants). 
 Dwarves receive a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks made to determine
the value of stone or metal items.
 Dwarves receive a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks related to stone or
metal.
Best class
Dwarves are especially suited to the fighter class, thanks in large part to their
Constitution adjustment and their innate combat skills. Cleric is a good second
choice for a dwarf character. While dwarves can excel at any class, they have
a harder time with the arcane spellcasting classes due to their innate magic
resistance.
Elves
Elves are slender and graceful, standing about 5 feet tall, with pale, otherworldly
skin, dark hair, large, almond-shaped eyes, and pointed ears. Elven home-
lands lie deep in the forests and woodlands, where the elves learn swordplay,
archery, and magic. With a love for nature and a talent for the arts, elves have
a unique outlook on life. They have amazingly long life spans, which tend to
make them appear amused and curious — they rarely show the extremes of
146
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

emotion that humans regularly demonstrate. Elf adventurers love freedom and
variety, which makes them lean toward the gentler aspects of chaos, usually
neutral or good. For elves, the call to adventure comes from an inborn wander-
lust, though they can become focused and relentless when a particular quest
catches their interest.
Play an elf character if you want to focus on magic or ranged combat.
Elves have special abilities that make them indispensable for wilderness
adventuring. If playing a hauntingly beautiful, somewhat alien and magically
inclined character appeals to you, consider selecting the elf race for your
character.
Ability adjustments
After you’ve assigned the ability scores you generated to your abilities, make
the following adjustments:
 Add 2 points to your Dexterity score. Elves are quick and graceful.
 Subtract 2 points from your Constitution score. Elves are frail and less
hearty than other races.
Special traits
Elves have the following racial traits:
 Elves are immune to magic sleep effects, and elves receive a +2 racial
bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.
 Elves have low-light vision, which allows them to see twice as far as a
human in poorly illuminated conditions.
 Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword,
rapier, longbow, and shortbow as bonus feats.
 Elves have keen senses. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search,
and Spot checks.
Best class
Elves make great arcane spellcasters, so the sorcerer class is a good choice for
them. While elves can excel at any class, be careful with the combat-oriented
classes due to their reduction in Constitution.
147
Chapter 13: Picking a Race

Halflings
Halflings are about half as tall as humans, with slender, muscular frames and
nimble features. Halflings are nomads, wanderers with no homelands to call
their own. Clever and capable, cunning and resourceful, halflings constantly
seek ways to avoid boredom and complacency. Halfling adventurers tend to
take a neutral stance when it comes to alignment, and they watch for ways to
use their skills to attain wealth and status. Although all halflings have a bit of
thief in them, most follow their curiosity and have learned how to get into
and out of trouble better than any of the other races.
Play a halfling character if you want to focus on stealth and skill use. Halflings
have special abilities that let them excel at avoiding danger. If curious, fun-
loving, good-hearted thieves appeal to your sense of adventure, consider
selecting the halfling race.
Ability adjustments
After you’ve assigned the ability scores you generated for your abilities,
make the following adjustments:
 Add 2 points to your Dexterity score. Halflings are quick, agile, and athletic.
 Subtract 2 points from your Strength score. Halflings are weaker than
the other races due to their small size.
148
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Special traits
Halflings have the following racial traits:
 Halflings are Small creatures. Due to their size, halflings gain a +1 size
bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus
on Hide checks. However, they must use smaller, less effective weapons
and have a base speed of 20 feet (4 squares).
 Halflings gain a +2 racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently 
checks.
 Halflings are naturally good at avoiding danger. They gain a +1 racial
bonus on all saving throws.
 Because they let their curiosity overpower their sense of fear, halflings
gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear.
 Due to special training and natural athleticism, halflings gain a +1 racial
bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings.
 Due to keen hearing, halflings gain a +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.
Best class
Halflings make great rogues. They do less well as melee fighters, but they can
excel as fighters that specialize in ranged attacks.
More Races to Choose From
The Player’s Handbook features additional races for player characters. These
include the gnome (a small race whose members make good bards), the half-
elf (whose features include human adaptability combined with elven special
features), and the half-orc (who is geared toward combat, especially as a 
barbarian).
Beyond the core books, the D&D game is full of fantasy races suitable for use
as player characters. The Eberron Campaign Setting, for example, introduces
four new races that offer new options for creating cool player characters. Start
by playing the races from the core books, and then look for new options with
which to expand your play experience.

Chapter 14
Selecting Feats
In This Chapter
 Adding up your feat choices
 Understanding feat requirements
 Getting a handle on feat types
 Taking a shortcut: Using feat ladders
N
ot all fighters fight the same. Some slice their foes to pieces with skillful
swordplay, some overpower their enemies with brute strength and a big
axe, and still others pincushion the bad guys with a barrage of arrows. Each of
these fighters learns different tactics and special maneuvers, or feats, to master
his or her chosen style of combat. Choosing your character’s feats is a key step
in differentiating your fighter from every other fighter in the game.
Every character gets to take advantage of feats; they’re not just for fighters.
Sorcerer characters can gain feats that make them especially good at casting
certain types of spells, or casting spells in combat, or crafting unique magic
items that will help them in their adventures. Clerics can learn feats that
make them extremely good at turning and destroying undead monsters such
as skeletons, ghouls, or vampires. And rogues can take feats that make them
stealthier, quicker, and deadlier in combat.
In this chapter, we tell you how your character gains feats and how you can use
feat selections to power up your character with great combat moves, special
edges, and hidden strengths. We also show you a set of handy shortcuts (we call
’em feat ladders) to steer you through selecting your character’s first few feats.
What’s a Feat?
Feats are specific combat maneuvers or unusual advantages that customize
your character’s capabilities and performance. They range from relatively
simple feats like Iron Will (which makes your character exceptionally hard to
affect with mind-controlling magic) to spectacular combat combinations like
Whirlwind Attack (which enables a character to launch a flurry of attacks
against all enemies within reach of his or her weapon).

Over the course of your character’s career, you eventually build up a collec-
tion of feats. Taken together, your character’s feats form a suite or library of
special edges, useful talents, and combat tricks that make him or her differ-
ent from any other character of the same class and level. The higher your
character’s level, the more feats he or she knows, and the more feats known,
the more unique and powerful your character becomes.
You can find the definitive word on feats in Chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook.
Table 5-1 on page 90 lists every feat you’ll ever need.
The Basics of Acquiring Feats
Here’s the bad news about feats: They’re great, but your character never
learns very many of them. Characters get one feat at 1st level, plus one feat
for every three levels they reach (which gives characters a total of two feats
at 3rd level, three feats at 6th level, four feats at 9th level, and so on).
152
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Sample feats
Here are three quick examples of some feats
you’ll find in the Player’s Handbook. (You’ll need
to visit the Player’s Handbook to find the defini-
tions of the feats we mention throughout this
book, as well as to see the entire range of feats
available to characters.)
IMPROVED INITIATIVE [GENERAL]
You can react more quickly than normal in a fight.
Benefit: You get a +4 bonus on Initiative checks.
Special: A fighter may select Improved Initiative
as one of his or her fighter bonus feats.
POWER ATTACK [GENERAL]
You can make exceptionally powerful melee
attacks.
Prerequisite: Strength 13.
Benefit: On your action, before making attack
rolls for the round, you may choose to subtract
a number from all melee attack rolls and add 
the same number to all melee damage rolls. This
number may not exceed your base attack
bonus. The penalty on attack rolls and bonus on
damage rolls applies until your next turn.
Special: If you attack with a two-handed weapon,
instead add twice the number subtracted from
your attack rolls.
A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his
or her fighter bonus feats.
STEALTHY [GENERAL]
You are particularly good at avoiding notice.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Hide checks
and Move Silently checks.
The bracketed [General] after each of these feats
tells you what sort of feat you’re looking at. In
each of these cases, the feat is a General feat,
which means that any character can take it. You
may notice that Power Attack has a special
requirement: Your character must have a Strength
score of 13 or better in order to choose it.

The three key exceptions to this rule are that
 Humans begin with one bonus feat at 1st level as a racial advantage.
 Fighters gain bonus feats at certain levels as a class feature.
 Other classes (for example, the monk, ranger, and wizard) or prestige
classes (such as the eldritch knight) may offer bonus feats as a class fea-
ture. For the lowdown on character classes, see Chapter 11.
If you want to maximize the number of feats you can acquire, you should
create a human fighter character. No other race/class combination in the
game picks up feats faster.
Table 14-1 shows the number of feats acquired by character level. The
Nonhuman Fighter and Human Fighter columns show this as the sum of level-
based feats and fighter bonus feats; for example, a 3rd-level human fighter
knows three feats for being a human and having three levels of a character
class, plus two bonus feats for being a 3rd-level fighter.

Meeting feat requirements
As much as you might like to pick Whirlwind Attack for your character’s first
feat choice, you can’t do it. Most feats have one or more requirements that
your character must meet before you can add them to his or her arsenal. For
153
Chapter 14: Selecting Feats

example, your character must have a Strength score of 13 or better to take
the Power Attack feat. The best feats require that your character first learn a
whole string of feats and meet a number of requirements. In the case of
Whirlwind Attack, your character must have a Dex of 13 or better, Int of 13 or
better, a base attack bonus of +4 or better, and four additional feats (Combat
Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack). Wow!
The good news for beginning characters is that a number of feats have
requirements that are easily met by even a 1st-level character (or no require-
ments at all), so you’re pretty much guaranteed of finding something your
character can use right from day one. Some of the best beginning feat choices
for each character class are summed up in Table 14-2.

Understanding feat types
Feats are organized into a number of different types, but there are four types
you need to know about in order to choose feats that are useful and effective
for your character. And they are
 General feats: These are feats that any character can learn. Your charac-
ter might need to meet some difficult requirements — some so hard that
some characters are effectively excluded from learning them. A fighter
can learn Whirlwind Attack by 6th level, but a sorcerer gets fewer feat
choices and couldn’t manage it until 12th level at the earliest. Most feats
are general feats.
 Item creation feats: These are reserved for spellcasters. If your charac-
ter can’t cast spells, he or she can’t learn an item creation feat. That’s
the way it is. Item creation feats are feats that let your character learn
how to manufacture various sorts of magic items, ranging from potions
and scrolls, on up to rings, wands, and staffs.
Item creation feats are hard to use in play, especially for a beginning player.
We recommend you steer away from them until your character is a spell-
caster of at least 6th level and you’ve checked with your DM to make sure
he or she will give you the opportunity to use an item creation feat.
154
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

 Metamagic feats: These are feats that let your character change the way
his or her spells work. They’re also reserved for spellcasters only. These
feats make your character’s spells more powerful, harder to resist, longer-
lasting, or suitable for casting even in the heaviest armor. If your character
is a cleric or a sorcerer, you’re going to want to pick up a metamagic feat
sooner or later in the character’s career — but they’re almost useless for
1st-level spellcasters, so don’t be in a hurry to pick one up.
 Fighter bonus feats: These are the bonus feats of the fighter class. They
do not constitute a feat type, per se — every feat in this category is a
general feat — but they share one important characteristic: If your char-
acter is a fighter, these feats are easy to acquire in the course of his or
her career.
Climbing up feat trees
Feats are often organized in specific feat trees or paths. For example, the
Improved Bull Rush, Cleave, Great Cleave, and Improved Sunder feats are part
of the Power Attack family. Your character needs to learn Power Attack first,
and then you can go on to choose feats that have Power Attack as a prerequi-
site. The best feats may require your character to climb all the way to the top
of a feat tree, sticking with it for level after level. In the case of Improved Bull
Rush, Cleave, or Improved Sunder, this is easy; when your character knows
Power Attack, you can use his or her next available feat selection to choose
any one of those feats. But Great Cleave is farther up the tree. To learn Great
Cleave, your character first must learn Power Attack, and then learn Cleave.
He or she can’t learn Great Cleave without mastering these two preceding
feats first.
The major feat trees in the Player’s Handbook are all named after the first feat
in the tree. They are
 Combat Expertise
 Dodge
 Improved Unarmed Strike
 Mounted Combat
 Point Blank Shot
 Power Attack
 Two Weapon Fighting
 Weapon Focus
155
Chapter 14: Selecting Feats

Making Your Choices Simpler 
with Feat Ladders
Your feat choices are pretty daunting because there are so many to choose
from. So, what we do here is provide you with three basic feat ladders to 
consider for each character class. The goal of a feat ladder is to chart your way
through your future feat picks at higher levels so that you get the feats you
want for your character as soon as possible. The Player’s Handbook doesn’t say
a word about feat ladders, but most experienced players designing characters
often make a point of planning several levels ahead in feat acquisition.
If you’re not sure which feats are the best choice for your character, you can
use these feat packages as a basic plan for making a sound (if not particularly
creative) set of feat choices for your character as he or she rises in level and
gains more feat choices.
Try the following process when evaluating your feat choices:
1. Determine the number of feat choices you have to make (see Table 14-1,
earlier in this chapter).
2. Identify your character’s class, and then decide which specialty or
function you want your character to master within that class.
A master swordsman, for example, needs to learn different feats from a
muscle-bound axe-wielder, even though they are both fighters. See Table
14-3 for a listing of these specialties and their descriptions.

3. Consult the feat ladder appropriate for your character’s class and
chosen path (for descriptions of these ladders, see the sections that
follow), or design your own feat ladder.
After you’ve played the game for a while and you’ve made up a few char-
acters, experiment with building feat ladders that exploit feat trees our
feat ladders here don’t make use of.
4. Make any extra feat selections you have coming to you, such as the
bonus feat that human characters get at 1st level.
5. Record your feat selections on your character sheet.
The feat ladders presented in this chapter don’t account for a human charac-
ter’s bonus feat. In most cases, you can use the bonus feat to buy your way
up the ladder even faster, but watch out for feats with tough requirements.
For example, if you’re following the skill fighter ladder on Table 14-4, you
simply can’t buy the Spring Attack feat before your character reaches 4th
level, because Spring Attack requires a +4 base attack bonus. Try using your
character’s human bonus feat to pick up Iron Will, Improved Initiative, Great
Fortitude, or Toughness. These feats are good for any character.
Fighter feat ladders
For the purpose of choosing feats, we’re going to make you decide if you
want your fighter character to be a melee fighter, a skill fighter, or a ranged
fighter, described in Table 14-4. (See Table 14-3 for a description of these spe-
cialties.) You can also use the melee fighter ladder for barbarians or paladins,
157
Chapter 14: Selecting Feats

or the ranged fighter ladder for rangers. (Rangers gain a small number of
bonus feats in their chosen combat style, so check out the ranger class
description in the Player’s Handbook to see which of these feats your charac-
ter can learn for free.)

Melee fighter
The basic plan for a melee fighter character is to run up to the monsters and
just beat the tar out of them with a sword, an axe, a warhammer, or whatever
implement of mayhem that catches your fancy. If you ever find that you don’t
know what you want your character to do, have him or her hit something! You
want your character to deal out horrible amounts of damage in the shortest
time possible.
The melee fighter needs a Strength score of 13 or better to make this feat
ladder work. Your character is going to be a sword-and-shield or axe-and-
shield fighter. Use the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat to choose either the
158
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

bastard sword or dwarven waraxe, because they dish out the most damage
for one-handed weapons.
The Power Attack feat doesn’t do that much for your character early in his or
her career, but what it does do is help the character meet the requirements
for Cleave — a very nice feat that will give your character extra chances to
deal damage. And the melee fighter is all about dealing damage, remember?
Skill fighter
A skill fighter character is built to move to the exact spot where he or she 
can do the most good and then slice the enemy to pieces with panache. A 
skill fighter is especially good at fighting defensively and moving around the
battlefield, so he or she shouldn’t waste time scuffling with the rabble — 
the skill fighter identifies the key member of the opposition and goes after
him, her, or it. Your character is willing to give up some damage-dealing
potential in order to keep a lot of options on the table.
This is not an easy ladder to climb. Your character needs a Dexterity of 13
and an Intelligence of 13 to progress here. Again, your character should be a
sword-and-shield fighter; the longsword is the best bet. You may also want to
keep your character out of heavy armor in order for him or her to be as
mobile as possible.
When you select the Spring Attack and Whirlwind Attack feats, you will find
that your character owns the battlefield. Stick and move, stick and move! If you
wanted your character to stand still and pound on a single foe at a time, you
should have created a melee fighter character.
Ranged fighter
Remember how Legolas shot everything that moved in the Lord of the Rings
movies? That’s a ranged fighter character. This feat ladder is designed to
make your character into the most fearsome archer in the dungeon. Make
sure you choose composite longbow for your character’s Weapon Focus; he
or she will be crippled if you select this feat path with a crossbow or a sling
(but you can do okay with thrown daggers, if you don’t mind having your
character constantly running out of ammunition).
To get the best bang for your buck in this feat ladder, your character should
have a Dexterity of at least 13. A Dex of 17 (or higher) is better, because you
can’t select the Manyshot feat without it. If your character doesn’t have a
high enough Dexterity for Manyshot, buy Dodge early, and then pick up
Mobility when your character reaches 10th level (you’ll be well on your way
to the feat Shot on the Run, which you can select at 12th level).
Rapid Shot and Manyshot form a perfect pair of tactical options. If you intend
to have your character stand still for the round, use Rapid Shot. If you want
your character to move, use Manyshot. If your character isn’t shooting three
arrows per round by 6th level, your heart’s just not in it.

Chapter 14: Selecting Feats

Rogue feat ladders
As a rogue, your character is not going to be buried in feat choices like the
fighter. You don’t get any bonus feat choices just for having a rogue charac-
ter, and that means feat choices are rare and precious.
The three paths we show you in Table 14-5 are the melee rogue, the sneaky
rogue, and the ranged rogue. (See Table 14-3 for a description of these special-
ties.) The melee rogue ladder works okay for monks, and the ranged rogue
ladder is useful for a ranger (although a ranger will move up this ladder a lot
faster than a rogue).

Melee rogue ladder
A melee rogue character is built to get into a scrape and dish out as much
sneak attack damage as he or she can. When one of your character’s allies
engages a foe in a toe-to-toe fight, your character gets behind the bad guy as
quick as possible to set up a flanking situation and then makes as many
attacks as he or she can.
Your character needs a Dexterity of 15 or higher to optimize this strategy,
because that’s what you need to select the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. (Then
again, every rogue should have a Dex of at least 15, really.) A good Strength
score will help your character dish out the damage.
160
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Improved Initiative is key for any rogue, because you want your character to
go first in a fight in order to maximize opportunities for dealing sneak attack
damage. Selecting the Weapon Finesse feat allows your character to use his
or her Dexterity bonus on melee attacks — this little trick will let a rogue
keep pace with the fighter’s melee attack ability better than any other non-
fighter. And Two-Weapon Fighting gives your character extra attacks. When
your character has a dangerous sneak attack, the more opportunities he or
she gets to score a hit, the better.
Sneaky rogue ladder
Characters who spend a lot of time right next to the bad guys get hurt, so the
sneaky rogue character wants no part of that. A sneaky rogue is the master of
not being seen in the first place. If your character has to fight, you want to
make sure he or she gets the drop on foes and leads off with a deadly strike
from hiding.
You can get by if your character has a Dexterity of 13 in this feat ladder, but a
higher score is better. A high Dexterity helps your character to win initiative
and makes him or her harder to hit, and both are highly desirable for any
rogue.
The Stealthy feat helps you to choose which fights your character gets into
and to surprise enemies by adding to Hide and Move Silently skill checks.
Improved Initiative helps your character to get the drop on enemies when he
or she strikes. Eventually, you should buy into the Dodge-Mobility-Spring
Attack feat tree, because a rogue’s best defense against a monster’s attack is
to not be standing next to it when its turn comes up.
Ranged rogue ladder
Your ranged rogue character is a gunslinger. Your character strikes first and
dishes out an enormous amount of damage before anyone else has even
started to move. In fact, your character might be a better ranged combatant
than even the ranged fighter. Sure, a ranged fighter will have a slightly better
attack bonus and deal a little more damage than your ranged rogue character
can do most of the time, but the rogue makes up for that by owning the first
round of combat.
Make sure your character has a Dexterity score of 17 or better in order to pick
up Manyshot quickly — it’s the favorite feat for a ranged rogue character. You’ll
also want to pick up Precise Shot as soon as you have a feat to spare (human
characters have an edge here because of their bonus feat choice), because
you’ll find your character shooting into melee quite often, and you don’t want
your character to take that attack penalty if he or she doesn’t have to.
As with the ranged fighter, you’ll find that your character constantly uses Rapid
Shot and Manyshot. When your character is dealing sneak attack damage, you
want him or her to make as many separate attack rolls as possible. Maximizing
your character’s rate of fire is your goal.

Chapter 14: Selecting Feats

Sorcerer feat ladders
You have an entirely different set of feat choices to weigh for a sorcerer char-
acter than for a fighter or rogue. You want to choose feats to enhance your
character’s magical prowess and to master useful spellcasting tricks, not
study the arts of swordsmanship and archery.
The three paths we describe in Table 14-6 are the attack sorcerer, the team
buff sorcerer, and the survival sorcerer. (See Table 14-3 for a description of
these specialties.) All three of these ladders work just as well for wizards as
they do for sorcerers.

Attack sorcerer ladder
An attack sorcerer character is an eggshell armed with a hammer. Your char-
acter’s philosophy is to beat down the monsters with his or her magical
power so fast that they don’t have an opportunity to hit back, because he or
she simply can’t stand up to any kind of punishment. Attack sorcerers count
on teammates to keep them alive so that their spells can decide the battle.
Your character doesn’t have any requirements to worry about in climbing
this feat ladder, but it works best if your sorcerer has the highest Charisma
score you can manage. This strategy is all about maximizing your character’s
offense, so you want your sorcerer to be the best raw spellcaster possible
before you begin choosing feats.
162
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The Spell Focus feat should be designed for the school of magic in which you
expect your character to cast most spells. (See Chapter 17 for more informa-
tion on choosing sorcerer spells.) Your best bets are enchantment, evocation,
or transmutation, because these schools offer attack spells that work better
when you maximize the difficulty of the saving throws your character forces
his or her enemies to make. Of these paths, Spell Focus (evocation) is proba-
bly the best bet for a new player (but make sure you remember to choose
evocation spells that require saving throws when you learn spells, or else you
won’t get any benefit for your Spell Focus feat!).
Team buff sorcerer ladder
A team buff sorcerer character is the master of spreading arcane power
around the adventuring party (or “buffing” allies, hence the name): Your
character uses his or her spells and abilities to dramatically enhance com-
panions’ fighting abilities. You’ve got to be a little patient to play a successful
team buff sorcerer, because your character will often be giving up a chance to
dish out some direct damage against the monsters in order to make his or
her companions better able to serve up (and withstand) much more damage
than they otherwise could.
As with the attack sorcerer, you don’t have much in the way of specific require-
ments to watch out for when choosing feats for your character. However, you
can afford for your character to not have the best Charisma score possible,
because you won’t need to make your character’s spells especially difficult to
resist — team buff sorcerers will be casting most of their spells to help their
allies, not harm their enemies.
Craft Wondrous Item is going to be your character’s signature feat on this path,
because it will allow him or her to build cheap and effective magical items to
share with everyone in the adventuring party. However, you may want to sound
out your Dungeon Master ahead of time and make sure he or she will give your
sorcerer a chance to use this feat as the campaign plays out. Sometimes DMs
run games that offer characters little downtime, and if your sorcerer never has a
chance to take a week off from adventuring and work on making a magic item or
two, you’ll never get to make use of the Craft Wondrous Item feat.
Survival sorcerer ladder
To put it bluntly, many sorcerers don’t make it past 1st level. The sorcerer
has the worst hit points and Armor Class of any character in the game, and
any monster with the faintest glimmer of intelligence probably identifies the
sorcerer as an enticing combination of Potentially Very Dangerous and Easily
Killed If I Act Now. The survival sorcerer ladder is all about buying time for
the character to grow old and powerful.
Once again, you don’t have any real feat or ability requirements to worry
about when choosing feats for your character. Make sure your sorcerer has
the best Dexterity and Constitution scores you can afford to go along with his
or her high Charisma. These abilities help keep a sorcerer alive.
163
Chapter 14: Selecting Feats

The feats on this ladder are quite simple — they allow you to add to your
character’s hit points and saving throws as much as you can. The Still Spell
feat requires a word of explanation, though. Still Spell lets your character
cast spells in armor with no chance of spell failure. So a decent strategy for
helping out your character’s Armor Class is to pick up a good light armor
(magic studded leather armor or a mithral chain shirt are good choices) and
then keep Still Spell in reserve for those occasions when you decide your
character just can’t afford any chance of spell failure.
Cleric feat ladders
Unlike most other characters, clerics don’t have any immediate needs that
they have to meet with thoughtful feat selections. You don’t have to buy into a
school of fighting the way you do with a fighter character or play catch-up with
a shortfall in feats you’d like to have for a rogue character. You don’t even have
to cover your character’s weaknesses or maximize offense like with a sorcerer.
Our three recommended paths for the cleric are the melee cleric, the turn
expert, and the spellcasting cleric, described in Table 14-7. (See Table 14-3 for
a description of these specialties.) Paladins can use the turn expert ladder
fairly well, and druids do well with the spellcasting cleric ladder.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Melee cleric ladder
A melee cleric character likes mixing it up, and he or she wants to get some
swings in. Your character will never be as good at melee combat as the
fighter is, but with the right spells, your character can come close for a short
time, and he or she has the added advantage of being able to buff friends and
heal the wounded when needed.
You don’t have any difficult requirements to worry about in following this
ladder, although you’ll find that a good Strength score will help your charac-
ter fight well in melee combat.
You should use the Martial Weapon Proficiency so your character can learn
to use a longsword, warhammer, or battleaxe. Those are the best martial
weapons that let your character use a shield. At higher levels, Craft Magic
Arms and Armor allows your character to customize weapons and defenses,
both for personal use and for his or her allies.
If you want to play a melee cleric, make sure that you take the War domain
when you’re choosing domains and spells for your character. (For more
about the cleric’s spell domains, see Chapter 17.) The special power of the
War domain is a free Martial Weapon Proficiency. That means you can spend
your character’s 1st-level feat choice on something else (Combat Casting is a
good choice) and move your character up this ladder that much faster.
Turn expert ladder
You’ve decided to maximize your character’s turn undead abilities. Turning
undead is a special class ability of the cleric that allows him or her to repel
monsters of the undead type, such as skeletons, ghouls, ghosts, or vampires.
Your cleric can even destroy relatively weak undead outright by using his or
her turn ability. (See Chapter 11 for more on a cleric’s turning ability.) Some
cleric domains offer your cleric the ability to turn or control other types of
creatures besides undead, so if you choose this path, think about selecting a
domain that will let your character use his or her good turning abilities
against as many foes as possible.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Key feats for other classes
Although these feat ladders give you service-
able clerics, fighters, rogues, and sorcerers,
you might wonder which feats you should con-
sider if your character happens to be a member
of one of the other classes in the game. Here’s
a quick and dirty set of suggestions for each of
the classes we don’t cover at length:
 Barbarian: Try the Power Attack feat tree or
Two-Weapon Fighting feat tree. You want
your character to be able to use his or her
enraged Strength score to dish out tons of
damage, and fighting with a two-handed
weapon and Power Attack or fighting with
a weapon in each hand is the best way to
do that.
 Bard: Skill Focus is a dog of a feat for any-
body else, but Skill Focus (Perform) will do
wonders for your character’s bardic music
abilities.
 Druid: Natural Spell is a tremendously good
feat for your character once he or she hits 6th
level, because it lets him or her cast spells
while in a wild shape form. You should also
consider taking Spell Focus (Conjuration) 
and Augment Summoning because your
character will always have plenty of summon
nature’s ally spells at his or her command
thanks to the druid class’s spontaneous cast-
ing ability.
 Monk: Like the fighter and the ranger, your
character gets a number of bonus feats. You
should take Weapon Focus (unarmed strike)
early in your character’s career because 
he or she will be throwing a lot of punches
and kicks. If your character’s Dexterity is
better than his or her Strength, Weapon
Finesse is a good choice too. Seriously con-
sider choosing the Dodge-Mobility-Spring
Attack feat tree, because a monk is so
much faster than anyone else that your
character will be able to make an attack
and then retreat out of an opponent’s reach
round after round.
 Paladin:With your character’s high Charisma
score, a paladin is a natural for Extra Turning
and Improved Turning. However, these feats
come at a cost: If you want your character to
keep pace with the fighter or the barbarian,
you’ll need to pick up the basic attack 
feats (Weapon Focus or Exotic Weapon
Proficiency) early on. Power Attack is handy
for a paladin because your character can
use the elegant trick of combining his or her
smite evil ability with the Power Attack feat
to hand out great big helpings of holy hurt on
the bad guys.
 Ranger: The ranger’s combat style class abil-
ity provides your character with a number of
free feats. You’ve got two choices: two-
weapon combat or archery. If you follow the
archery path for your ranger, you can use the
ranged fighter feat ladder described earlier
in this chapter. If you decide you want your
character to be a dual-weapon ranger, try
picking up Weapon Focus in a weapon your
character can use two of easily (short
swords are the best for this trick).
 Wizard: Your character is essentially in the
same boat as a sorcerer, but a wizard 
gets a modest number of item creation or
metamagic feats for free. Refer to the 
sorcerer feat ladders for good wizard feat
progressions.

As with other cleric feat ladders, your character doesn’t need to meet many
special requirements to follow this ladder. However, you’ll want your charac-
ter to have the best Charisma score you can manage to go along with a high
Wisdom and other key scores. A high Charisma bonus will help with every
turning attempt your character makes.
Extra Turning is a feat you can take as often as you like; your character gains
four additional turn attempts per day each time you select this feat. If you are
going to try this feat ladder, you may want to search out other DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS supplements (such as Complete Divine) that include special feats
known as divine feats. These aren’t in the
Player’s Handbook, but they’re driven by uses
of your cleric’s turn undead ability, and some
of them are very powerful.
Spellcasting cleric ladder
A spellcasting cleric character wants to be
the most powerful and efficient divine spell-
caster possible. Your character has some
decent direct-attack spells, but he or she is
no sorcerer; most of your cleric’s “attacks”
come in the form of spells that enhance his
or her companions’ fighting abilities and
defenses.
Your character doesn’t have any ability require-
ments or feat trees to climb, but you will 
want your character to have the best Wisdom
score you can manage. You want your character
to be able to cast as many spells as possible,
and you want those spells to be difficult to
resist.
As a spellcasting cleric, your character’s best
offensive strategy may lie in the various summon
monster spells. Here, at least, your character is
every bit the equal of a sorcerer. By choosing the
Augment Summoning feat, your character will 
get the most out of each monster-summoning spell
he or she casts. But before you pick up the Augment
Summoning feat, you need to choose Spell Focus
(Conjuration), which is the prerequisite for
Augment Summoning.

Picking Skills
In This Chapter
 Getting a handle on skills
 Buying skills for your character
 Quick picks: Using skill packages
R
egdar the fighter and Kerwyn the rogue are fleeing from a rampaging
umber hulk when they come to a dangerous-looking rope bridge sway-
ing over a bottomless underground chasm. Kerwyn darts across the bridge
with ease, but Regdar picks his way over the obstacle hand-over-hand, only
one small slip away from a terrifying plunge. If you’re wondering how Kerwyn
made it look so easy, the answer is simple: skills. Kerwyn the rogue is trained
in balancing, tightrope walking, tumbling, and other such tasks. Crossing a
rope bridge is a piece of cake for him.
In this chapter, we tell you how characters learn and use skills, and we show
you a set of quick skill packages that will make buying skills for your charac-
ter fast, easy, and effective.
All about Skills
Skills represent your character’s training in tasks that don’t involve fighting
or spellcasting. The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game has almost 50 distinct skills in
the Player’s Handbook, ranging from Appraise to Use Rope.
The amount of training your character has in any particular skill is measured
by the number of skill ranks he or she possesses in that skill. For example, a
1st-level fighter might have 4 ranks in Climb, 2 ranks in Jump, and 1 rank in
Spot. This character is pretty good at climbing, can manage a jump when he
or she needs to, and has a little edge in spotting ambushes or hard-to-see
objects. The character has 0 ranks in all other skills, because he or she is just
not trained in those tasks.

The number of skill ranks your character can spend depends on his or her
class, Intelligence score, and level. Some character classes gain more skills
than others — for example, rogues and rangers rely on their skills, while
fighters rely on combat ability and sorcerers rely on magic. And, as you might
expect, smart, high-level characters have more skills than not-so-smart, low-
level characters. We explain the skill selection process later in this chapter, in
the “Choosing your character’s skills” section.
Every skill is associated with a key ability, which is simply the ability score
that modifies any checks with that skill. Balance, for instance, is a Dexterity-
based skill — the reasoning is that if you have great dexterity, you’re good at
balancing, and if you’ve got a crummy dexterity (like the authors), you’re ter-
rible at it. Sometimes a great ability score can easily count for more than a
minimal amount of training. A character with 1 rank in Balance and a
Dexterity modifier of +0 is not as good at balancing as another character with
0 ranks in Balance and a Dexterity modifier of +3.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 
A sample skill
Here’s an example of a skill description from the
Player’s Handbook, Chapter 4. (You can find
descriptions of all the other skills in the game
there.)
OPEN LOCK (DEX; TRAINED ONLY)
You can pick padlocks, finesse combination
locks, and solve puzzle locks. The effort requires
at least a simple tool of the appropriate sort (a
pick, pry bar, blank key, wire, or the like). If you
use masterwork thieves’ tools, you gain a +2 cir-
cumstance bonus on the check.
Check: The DC for opening a lock varies from 20
to 40, depending on the quality of the lock, as
given on the table below.
Lock
DC
Very simple lock
20
Average lock
25
Good lock
30
Amazing lock
40
Action: Opening a lock is a full-round action.
Special: If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you
get a +2 bonus on Open Lock checks.
Untrained: You cannot pick locks untrained.
The information following the name of the skill
tells you that this is a Dexterity-based skill, so
your character’s Dexterity modifier applies to
Open Lock attempts. Trained Only means that
you can’t try to use this skill unless your char-
acter has at least 1 rank in Open Lock. The infor-
mation under Check tells you what sort of
Difficulty Class various applications of this skill
have; this is the target number you’ll have to hit
with a roll of 1d20 + your skill ranks + your Dex
modifier in order to open a lock of that sort.
Action tells you how long it takes to use the skill,
and Special lets you know about special modi-
fiers or circumstances that affect the skill.

Using skills
To use one of your character’s skills, you make a skill check. A skill check is a
twenty-sided die (d20) roll modified by your character’s skill ranks, the key
ability score for the skill, and any special modifiers that might apply. The most
common special modifier is an armor check penalty — a negative modifier to
certain movement-based skills for wearing heavy armor. If a skill is affected by
the armor check penalty, the skill description will clearly state so. In addition,
a number of spells and magic items improve certain types of skill checks, and
there may be various circumstance modifiers the DM decides to apply.
Your character doesn’t always have to have training in a skill to try to use it.
In fact, it’s not uncommon at all for you to have to make an untrained skill
check. Any character can try to climb a wall, balance on a narrow ledge, or
make a jump, even if he or she doesn’t have a single rank in the Balance,
Climb, or Jump skills. You simply have no skill ranks to add to the skill check,
and so you have to live with whatever modifier your character’s ability score,
magic, or circumstances provide. You might succeed with the skill check
despite your character’s lack of training, provided the task is relatively easy
or you get lucky with your d20 roll.
Skill Check = d20 + skill ranks + ability modifier + special modifiers (if any)
Your skill check yields a result that might range from less than 0 (you rolled
poorly on a skill that your character had few or no ranks in and significant
negative modifiers) to 30 or better (you rolled well on a skill in which your
character has a lot of ranks or significant positive modifiers for his or her
ability scores and magic).
The DM compares your skill check result to a Difficulty Class (DC) or target
number appropriate to the task your character is trying to accomplish.
Difficulty Class works a lot like Armor Class — it’s a target number you’re
trying to reach or exceed by rolling a d20 and adding the appropriate modi-
fiers. For something easy, the DC might only be 5 or 10. For something
fiendishly hard, the DC might be 35, 40, or even higher. In fact, it might be
completely impossible for your character to succeed at some tasks; no
human is going to leap a 100-foot wide crevasse (a DC 100 Jump check, in
case you’re wondering) without a lot of magical help.
The skill descriptions in the Player’s Handbook list specific DCs for all sorts of
things you might have your character try to do with that skill. Your DM uses
these skill descriptions to set the DC for any specific skill use you want your
character to attempt. Sometimes your DM just has to take a best guess at
how hard something is, because you can try almost anything in a D&D game.
If you want your character to leap down from a rooftop and land astride a 
galloping horse streaking by below, it’s a Jump check of some kind, but you
171
Chapter 15: Picking Skills

won’t find “jump into the saddle of a galloping horse” on the DC table in the
Jump skill. That’s why you have a Dungeon Master, so someone can take a
shot at adjudicating things the rules don’t cover.
Table 15-1 shows some sample DCs.

Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook has long descriptions of every skill,
including a number of sample DCs for tasks in each skill.
Choosing your character’s skills
When you create a 1st-level character, you gain a certain number of skill
points you can use to buy skill ranks. The number of skill points you gain
depends on your character’s class, your character’s Intelligence bonus, and
whether or not you’re playing a human — humans gain more skill points than
characters of other races. As your character gains levels, you gain additional
skill points to add to existing skills or to buy entirely new skills.
After you know the number of skill points you’ve got to spend, you’re ready
to buy your character’s skills. There’s one more thing you need to know
before you start buying skill ranks: Some skills cost double. Take a look at
Table 4-2 in the Player’s Handbook, page 63. You’ll see that each skill is coded
as “C” or “cc” for each character class. This stands for class skills (C) and
cross-class (cc) skills. When you buy a class skill, you get 1 rank for every
skill point you spend. When you buy a cross-class skill, you must pay 2 skill
points for 1 skill rank.
172
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

This distinction between class skills and cross-class skills also governs the
maximum number of skill ranks your character is allowed to have in a single
skill at any given time.
 For a class skill, you’re allowed to have a number of ranks equal to your
character’s level +3. For example, a 1st-level character can have up to 
4 ranks in any one class skill; a 6th-level character could have up to 9
ranks in any one class skill.
 For cross-class skills, your character can have only half as many ranks
as with class skills. For example, 1st-level character can have 2 ranks in
a cross-class skill, and a 7th-level character can have 5 ranks in a cross-
class skill.
173
Chapter 15: Picking Skills
Six key skills
Not all skills are created equal. While skills such
as Heal or Use Magic Device sound like they
should be pretty important in the game, in prac-
tice you’ll fall back on your character’s class
abilities and spells to deal with most situations
involving those skills. Here’s a short list of six
skills with key game effects that you won’t want
to ignore:
 Bluff: Rogues can use the Bluff skill to man-
ufacture sneak attack opportunities with
the Feint in Combat skill application. It’s also
a great skill for your character to use to talk
his or her way past suspicious guards or
getting into places he or she shouldn’t be.
 Concentration: If your character is a spell-
caster, you should buy up the Concentration
skill as high as you can for the first ten
levels or so of your character’s career.
Concentration lets spellcasters safely cast
spells while enemies are standing right next
to them; without this skill, spellcasters could
find themselves in situations where they
don’t dare to try to cast spells in the middle
of big fights.
 Diplomacy: This is a great catch-all skill for
convincing nonplayer characters (NPCs) to
help your character out, leave him or her
alone, or give your character something he
or she needs.
 Hide: There are two sneaking-up-on-people
skills: Hide and Move Silently. Hide is proba-
bly the more useful of the two. If you’re play-
ing a rogue, you can use your character’s
Hide skill to set up sneak attack opportunities
(or avoid fights altogether, if you prefer).
 Spot:There are two I’m-hard-to-sneak-up-on
skills: Listen and Spot. Spot is probably the
more useful one. If you don’t like monsters
surprising your character, take some ranks in
Spot so your character will see ’em coming.
 Tumble: This might be the best skill in the
game. If your character has a lot of ranks in
Tumble, he or she can move around a
raging battle with impunity, rolling and leap-
ing right past enemies who otherwise
would get a lot of free attacks on your char-
acter. Rogues who like to sneak attack their
enemies find that Tumble is essential for
flanking their enemies and making sneak
attacks possible. It’s also a great technique
for getting away from trouble.

Here’s the quick summary of the skill purchasing process:
1. Determine the base skill points per level for your character class, as
follows:
• 2 skill points/level: Cleric, fighter, paladin, sorcerer, wizard
• 4 skill points/level: Barbarian, druid, monk
• 6 skill points/level: Bard, ranger
• 8 skill points/level: Rogue
2. Modify your base skill points per level by your character’s
Intelligence score modifier.
For example, a wizard with an Intelligence score of 15 gains 4 skill points
per level: 2 skill points per level for being a wizard, +2 skill points per level
for his or her 15 Int. You never get less than 1 skill point per level, even if
your character is dumb as a post. You can find this information in Table
15-2, in the Skill Points/Level row for your character’s Intelligence score.
3. Add 1 skill point per level if your character is a human.
4. Calculate your character’s starting skill points.
Your character’s starting skill points at 1st level are equal to 4 times the
number of skill points per level. For example, if in the last step you calcu-
lated that your character would receive 4 skill points per level, you multi-
ply this by four to determine you have 16 skill points to spend on your
character’s skills at 1st level. (You can find this information in Table 15-2,
in the Starting Skill Points row for your character’s Intelligence score.)
At 2nd level and each following level, your character gains skill points
equal to his or her class’s skill points per level, modified as described
above for Intelligence score and race.
5. Buy your character’s skills.
Check our quick-pick skill packages (later in this chapter) for a fast set
of reasonable skill picks. Or, if you prefer, go skill-shopping on Table 4-2:
Skills on page 63 of the Player’s Handbook.
You pay 1 skill point per skill rank for class skills, and 2 skill points per
skill rank for cross-class skills. Remember that the maximum number of
skill ranks your character can have in any one skill is equal to his or her
level +3 (or half that number for a cross-class skill).

(...) The number in parenthesis shows how many skill points a human character of that Intelligence
score and class earns.
If you ever want to figure out how many skill points a higher-level character
has available, you don’t have to add them up level by level. Try this simple
formula:
Total skill points = (level +3) × (modified skill pts/level)
For example, say you’re creating a 5th-level human fighter with an Intelligence
of 13. That character’s total skill points available equals (5+3) × (2+1 Int 
modifier +1 human bonus), or 32 skill points.
Be warned: This technique doesn’t work if your character’s Intelligence
changes over the course of the levels in question. For example, wizards often
choose to increase their Intelligence scores at every opportunity, so you’ll
need to be more careful when figuring out how many skill points that charac-
ter has.
175
Chapter 15: Picking Skills

Quick Picks: Using Skill Packages
The Skills table in the Player’s Handbook is intimidating. In order to help you
separate the useful from the distracting, we’ve created a set of skill packages
for each class.
To use these packages, you need to determine how many skill points per level
your character gains; refer to the “Choosing your character’s skills” section,
earlier in this chapter. Tables 15-3 through 15-6 sum up the skill packages. The
1st-Level Skill Buy column is what you use to spend your character’s 1st-level
skill points. The Skill Improvement column offers some advice on how to spend
skill points your character receives as he or she gains levels.
Fighter skill package
A fighter is one of those characters who just doesn’t care that much about
skills. Your character lives or dies by fighting ability, not skill checks. However,
your character does receive a small number of skill points to spend, and
there’s no reason not to spend them intelligently. Table 15-3 gives you some
examples of useful skills to choose for a fighter.

The Ride skill is important only if you think you might eventually be interested
in exploring mounted combat. If your game is strictly confined to dungeons, or
if you prefer to simply have your character jump off his or her horse at the
first sign of trouble, you won’t ever need to put any ranks in Ride. Try buying
more ranks in Climb or Jump instead (or, if you’re already planning on maxing
out your character’s Climb and Jump skills, pick up a skill like Intimidate).
176
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Spot is useful for avoiding ugly surprises, such as monster ambushes. Even
though this is a cross-class skill for a fighter and you’ll pay 2 skill points per
rank, you should make an effort to improve your character’s Spot skill over
time. It’s one of the few skills that might actually mean the difference between
life and death.
Speaking of life and death, Balance and Swim are not bad skills to have a couple
of ranks in. A fighter doesn’t often have to make Balance or Swim checks, but
these tend to be skills that come up in all-or-nothing situations. In other words,
the consequences of failing a critical Balance check (to cross a swaying rope
bridge over a bottomless pit, for example) might be lethal. If your character
has some skill points to spare, it’s worth a small investment.
Rogue skill package
As a rogue, your character is the master of skills. They are absolutely essen-
tial to your success in playing a rogue character. You should take some time
and bone up on the Skills chapter in the Player’s Handbook, because your
familiarity with your character’s skills will directly impact how well you are
playing that character. You’d expect someone playing a sorcerer to know
something about his character’s spells — if you’re playing a rogue, you
should be just as conversant about your character’s skills. Table 15-4 shows a
selection of useful skills for a rogue.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Rogues can do three things that no other class can really manage: find traps,
disable traps, and open locked doors. Consequently, our recommendation is
that you max out your rogue’s skill ranks in Search, Disable Device, and Open
Lock. If your rogue isn’t covering these important functions for the adventur-
ing party, no one is. Most other tasks can be handled by other characters
with the right spells or the right tactics, but these skills are very hard to fake.
Spend the skill points and get good at them.
After those three key skills, you have a lot more discretion. Hide and Move
Silently are important skills for your character to have, because a rogue is
expected to be able to sneak into places without being seen or heard. Spot
and Tumble are important for setting up fights and tactical movement during
a battle. For the rest of your character’s skills, you should decide early on if
you want to play a fast-talker or a ninja, as follows:
 Fast-talking rogues spend skill points on people skills such as Gather
Information, Intimidate, Sense Motive, Diplomacy, or even Use Magic
Device. Those are very useful in many out-of-dungeon encounters and
investigations, but don’t bother with this track unless your character’s
Charisma score is 10 or better. If you’ve got a less-than-charismatic char-
acter, don’t sink skill points into making him or her more likable.
 Ninja wannabes are those rogues who totally give up on interaction
skills and instead choose getting-into-places skills such as Climb,
Balance, Jump, and Swim. If you’d rather not talk to the bad guys, or if
your character’s Charisma is pretty crummy, spend the skill points on
movement skills instead.
Sorcerer skill package
Skills? Bah! Sorcerers have magic. Skills are merely an afterthought for a sor-
cerer, with the exception of the Concentration skill. You will want to improve
your character’s Concentration as much as you can. Table 15-5 provides a
selection of useful skills for a sorcerer.

Other than Concentration, which is clearly your first skill priority, your char-
acter really doesn’t need any skills at all. Spend those skill points as you like.
Spot is useful for not getting surprised at the beginning of a fight, so if you
don’t know what else to do with your character’s skill points, you could do
worse than to buy up the Spot skill. Bluff is an opportunistic skill for a sor-
cerer; because your character has a great Charisma score (he or she is a sor-
cerer, after all), you might as well add a few ranks in Bluff, and look for
chances to put your character’s high Charisma to work.
Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft are gener-
ally expected of a sorcerer, because he or she
is an arcane spellcaster. If your character
doesn’t know anything about these skills, no
other character in the party will. But you
don’t need to buy those skills if you don’t
have many skill points to spare.
You may want to invest in Diplomacy and
Gather Information if you have the skill
points to spare. Even though these aren’t
class skills for your character, it’s not
unusual for a sorcerer to serve as the
spokesperson for the adventuring party
(again, that high Charisma comes in
handy). If your character is the one the
party will expect to persuade the frost
giant chieftain to let them go instead of
cooking them for dinner, you may want to
pad that skill check with a little training in
sweet-talking.
180
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Cleric skill package
Like the sorcerer, a cleric doesn’t rely much on skills. A cleric prefers to use
spells and combat to solve problems, and skills are just the finishing details
of your character. Don’t be afraid to spend some skill points on things that
just strike your fancy, because your cleric doesn’t need to be good at very
many skills. Table 15-6 describes the skills most useful for a cleric.

Because your character is a spellcaster, Concentration is a key skill — perhaps
even more so than it is for the sorcerer, because a cleric is expected to be in
the thick of the fight from time to time. Your second skill priority is Knowledge
(religion), at least until your character reaches 5 skill ranks in that skill. The
reason for this is that 5 ranks of Knowledge (religion) confers a +2 synergy
bonus on checks to turn undead. It’s not often that a skill can provide a con-
crete benefit to a combat action like turning undead.
You may be tempted to take a lot of ranks in the Heal skill, because every-
body knows that clerics are the master healers in the game — but you don’t
need to do that unless you really have spent all the other skill points you
want to. Most of the time, your character can cast the cure minor wounds and
cure light wounds spells to automatically stabilize dying characters, and that’s
the task the Heal skill is most useful for.
181
Chapter 15: Picking Skills

As with any other character, you’ll do well to buy a rank or two in Spot if you
can, but don’t feel like you have to. Because your character is a cleric, he or
she probably has a high Wisdom score, and that means he or she will be
pretty good at Spot checks even if you didn’t put any ranks in Spot.
Finally, you may want to pay for a couple of ranks in Balance, Jump, Swim, or
Tumble. Most clerics wear heavy armor and don’t have much in the way of a
Dexterity score, which means that fairly easy Balance checks are murder-
ously hard for them. The consequences of a failed Balance check or Swim
check might be catastrophic, so you may want to invest a few skill points in
these movement skills against the day your character will need to make a key
check or die horribly.
182
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Chapter 16
Choosing Armor, Weapons, 
and Gear
In This Chapter
 Choosing the optimal weapon
 Suiting up with the best armor
 Picking out adventuring gear
 Improving your character’s weapons and armor
You’ve picked out your character’s race, class, feats, and skills. You know
who your character is and what he or she can do. But there’s one more
component your character needs — stuff. Just because a character knows
how to swing a dire flail doesn’t mean that he or she is going to start out
walking around with one. All the training in the world won’t do your charac-
ter any good if you don’t actually take a few minutes to equip him or her for
adventuring.
In this chapter, we tell you about the considerations you should keep in mind
when choosing your character’s equipment, and we show you some quick
optimal weapon and armor picks so that you can make good starting choices
and begin playing fast.
Chapter 7 in the Player’s Handbook tells you everything you could possibly
want to know about your choices in mundane adventuring gear, ranging from
weapons and armor to handy things like rope, grappling hooks, lanterns, and
spell component pouches. Magic items are defined in the Dungeon Master’s
Guide, Chapter 7.
Going Shopping
You’ve got two basic options for equipping your character: Choose a starting
package, or do it yourself. Taking a starting package — a list of preselected
gear and weapons — is the quick and easy way to go. If you’d like to try this

option, go to the Player’s Handbook. Each of the character class descriptions
in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook ends with a starting package.
On the other hand, if you want to do it yourself, you have to peruse the various
tables in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook, deciding what you want. You start
with a sum of money based on your character’s class (see Table 7-1 on page
111 of the Player’s Handbook), equal to 150 gold pieces (gp) for a fighter, 125 gp
for a cleric or rogue, or 75 gp for a sorcerer. These amounts are average. Frankly,
picking out equipment yourself can be a little tedious, and many of the minor
details, such as rations and bedroll, are things that are never going to matter
in many normal DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games.
If possible, you should make sure that you buy the following equipment for
your character:
 A melee weapon (for example, a sword, mace, or dagger)
 A ranged weapon (bow or crossbow)
 The best suit of class-appropriate armor you can afford
 A shield (if you’re playing a cleric or fighter)
 Class-specific items (a holy symbol, spell component pouch, or set of
thieves’ tools)
 A light source such as torches, lantern and oil, or a sunrod
 A backpack with rope, rations, waterskin, and anything else you think
your character would need
The starting packages provide a serviceable set of gear for each class, but you
may want to customize your selection somewhat. For example, the fighter
starting package provides a greatsword and scale mail. The greatsword’s a
perfectly fine weapon, but it’s a two-handed weapon, which means your
fighter is passing up on the opportunity to use a shield. You may prefer for
your character to have a little less offense and a little more defense. So trade
down if you like. If you look on Table 7-5: Weapons in the Player’s Handbook,
184
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Money in D&D
The basic unit of currency in D&D is the gold
piece, abbreviated as gp. When you see some-
thing that costs 15 gp, that’s 15 gold pieces.
Beneath gold pieces are silver pieces (sp); one
gold is worth ten silver pieces. Under silver
pieces are copper pieces (one silver is worth
ten copper pieces), but by that point you really
shouldn’t care. Not many players actually keep
track of how many copper pieces are in their
characters’ pockets. Try this little mnemonic:
Gold pieces are dollars, silver pieces are dimes,
and copper pieces are pennies. So if you have 
4 gp, 6 sp, and 15 cp, it’s like $4.75.

you’ll see that the greatsword costs 50 gp. You can trade down to a longsword,
which only costs 15 gp, then go to Table 7-6: Armor and buy a heavy steel
shield for 20 gp. Take everything else in the package, and you’ll have 15 gp left
in change.
Choosing the Right Weapon
For most characters, choosing the right weapons is an important part of
building your combat strategy and creating an unforgettable character.
Weapons have three important characteristics, as follows:
 Proficiency: This characteristic describes how complex the weapon is
to use. Weapons are organized into simple, martial, or exotic categories.
Simple weapons are weapons that characters of almost any class can
swing without penalty, martial weapons require some training (for exam-
ple, being a fighter), and exotic weapons are weapons that no character
is proficient in without taking an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat to learn
to use that weapon. (The exception is that certain classes and races gain
the ability to use specific exotic weapons as a class or race feature; for
example, as a class feature, rogues are proficient with hand crossbows.)
 Type: Type describes the weapon’s basic role and use. Weapons are
divided into melee weapons and ranged weapons; melee weapons are
divided again into light, one-handed, and two-handed weapons. A char-
acter can use a light weapon or one-handed weapon in one hand and
still use a shield, but your character can’t use a shield and a two-handed
weapon at the same time.
185
Chapter 16: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear
Equipping higher-level characters
If you are creating a higher-level character to
join an existing game, you’ll find that the ago-
nizing decisions of the typical impoverished 
1st-level character are simply a thing of the past.
High-level characters typically have thousands
of gold pieces worth of equipment, including
magic weapons, armor, potions, and other such
wondrous possessions.
To equip a higher-level character, you should
ask your DM how much money your character
has to spend. Then ask for the DM’s help in pick-
ing out suitable magic items for your character.
Remember, if your character doesn’t have a
magic weapon or magic armor, you’ll need to
pick out nonmagical gear to serve. Make sure
that you review the bulleted list in the “Going
Shopping” section and equip your character
with magical or nonmagical versions of every-
thing on the list.

 Damage: This is the fun part. Weapon damage is derived from two compo-
nents: the weapon’s base damage, which is a number ranging from 1d3 to
2d6, and its critical range and multiple. You want a weapon that has a high
base damage, a wide critical range, and a high critical multiple. A wide
critical range such as 18–20 or 19–20 means that you’ll score critical hits
more often. A high critical multiple, such as ×3 or ×4, means that when
you do score a critical hit, you’ll triple or quadruple the damage you deal.
In general, exotic weapons are better than martial weapons, which are better
than simple weapons. And two-handed weapons deal out a lot more damage
than one-handed weapons. Table 16-1 sums the best weapon choices,
depending on your character’s class, whether you’re after a one-handed or
two-handed weapon, and whether you are willing to spend a feat on a weapon
proficiency or not.

Dwarves enjoy some special advantages with weapon choices. For dwarves,
the dwarven waraxe and dwarven urgrosh (a spearlike weapon) are treated
as martial weapons, not exotic weapons. That means that a dwarf fighter can
choose the dwarven waraxe — a weapon every bit as good as a bastard
sword — without spending an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat. Similarly, a
dwarf cleric, rogue, or sorcerer who takes a Martial Weapon Proficiency feat
might as well choose the dwarven waraxe instead of the longsword.
186
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Elves also have an edge with weapon choices. All elves, regardless of class,
are proficient with the longsword, rapier, longbow, and shortbow. If you’re
playing an elf fighter, this doesn’t help at all. But if you’re playing an elf rogue,
sorcerer, or cleric, you should definitely choose longsword and longbow for
your character’s weapons. It doesn’t even cost a feat.
Fighter weapons
A fighter pretty much has the pick of weapons. Fighters are proficient with
almost every weapon, and the fighter class has the feats to spare if you
decide you want your fighter to become proficient in something exotic.
If you don’t spend an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, the best choices are the
longsword (if you want your character to fight one-handed and keep another
hand free for a shield or second weapon) or greatsword (if you want your
character to deal more damage at the cost of some defense). The battleaxe
and warhammer are good replacements for the longsword, if you prefer. The
greataxe or falchion (a big two-handed scimitar, in case you’re wondering)
are reasonable substitutions for the greatsword.
If you’re willing to spend a feat on weapon proficiencies, buy an Exotic
Weapon Proficiency for the bastard sword or spiked chain. The bastard
sword effectively gives +1 damage above the longsword. The spiked chain
deals less damage than the greatsword, but your character will gain reach —
the ability to strike foes who aren’t standing next to him or her. That’s a huge
tactical advantage. The spiked chain also can be used for a number of fancy
maneuvers such as trip attacks.
For a ranged weapon, buy a composite longbow as soon as you can, and get
one sized for your character’s Strength bonus. No other missile weapon in
the game comes close in terms of rate of fire and damage potential to the
composite longbow.
Barbarians, paladins, and rangers all have access to the same weapons as the
fighter, and these classes face the same decisions.
Rogue weapons
A rogue’s weapon choices are somewhat limited compared to the fighter’s
choices, but that’s okay. Rogues have some decent weapons available to
them, and to be honest, whatever weapons rogues employ in battle aren’t
anywhere near as important as their sneak attack capability. When your char-
acter is dealing 20 points of damage from a sneak attack, the difference
between a weapon that averages 3 points a hit or 4 points a hit just isn’t that
important.
187
Chapter 16: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear

If you don’t want to spend a feat on your rogue’s weapon choices, go with the
rapier. If you’re playing a melee-oriented rogue, you’ll probably want your
character to fight with rapier and dagger pretty quickly, so don’t tie up his or
her second hand on a mediocre weapon such as a spear.
If you’re willing to pick up a Martial Weapon Proficiency feat, learn to use the
longsword. It’s the most efficient and effective one-handed weapon. If your
rogue happens to be an elf, he or she can just use the longsword right from
the start; all elves, regardless of class, know how to use the longsword.
For a ranged weapon, your choices are the light crossbow or shortbow. At
higher levels, the shortbow will give your character a better rate of fire than
a light crossbow.
Cleric weapons
Weapons are tough for clerics. As a cleric, your character wants to be handy
in a fight, but he or she begins with proficiency only in simple weapons. A
mace, morningstar, or spear just doesn’t deal the same damage that a simi-
larly sized sword or axe deals, so you’re a little bit behind the eight-ball in
your character’s weapon selection. You should seriously consider using a
feat so your cleric can become proficient in a better weapon.
If you don’t want to spend a feat, choose the heavy mace for a one-handed
weapon or the spear for a two-handed weapon. You’ll probably be happier
with a shield and a one-handed weapon. If you choose to buy a Martial
Weapon Proficiency feat, the longsword is your best choice.
If you want a free weapon boost, choose the War domain as one of your clerics
two domains (see Chapter 17 for more about domains and spells). Choosing
the War domain grants your cleric a free proficiency in his or her deity’s
favored weapon (along with a free Weapon Focus feat in that weapon, too!)
Take a light crossbow for a ranged weapon, but don’t expect to get much use
out of it. Most clerics have better things to do in combat than take potshots
with a crossbow.
Sorcerer weapons
Sorcerers are restricted to a pretty short list of weak weapons. But you know
what? You don’t care if you’re playing a sorcerer. Most of a sorcerer’s actions
will be taken up with casting spells, so toting around an effective melee
weapon just isn’t necessary for this class.
188
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

If you really want to, you can take a Martial Weapon Proficiency feat to get your
character’s hands on a better weapon, but here’s the deal: A sorcerer is never
going to make melee attacks, so don’t waste a feat on this. (If you happen to be
playing an elf sorcerer, though, your character is proficient with the longsword
as a racial advantage — so your character might as well carry one.)
Take a light crossbow for a ranged weapon. Early in their careers, sorcerers
might find it useful to hang back from a fight and shoot when they run out of
spells. Hopefully, your character will have magic wands for that job after he
or she gains a level or two.
Wizards have the same weapon choices as sorcerers.
Choosing Armor
The other important decision you need to make in equipping your character
is what sort of armor you intend him or her to wear. Unlike weapons, you’ll
have an easier time changing your mind about armor — there are no feats
that require you to choose a specific type of armor to be good at.
There are two basic decisions you need to make when considering your
choice of armor: shield or no shield, and speed versus protection.
Shield or no shield?
If you’re playing a cleric or fighter, you need to decide if you want your char-
acter to carry a shield or not. Shields are a great way to improve Armor Class
by a couple of points, but by carrying a shield, your character is giving up
some offense. Instead of carrying a shield, your character could be swinging
a two-handed weapon or even fighting with a weapon in each hand. Many of
the most combat-effective character builds revolve around fighting with two
weapons.
There really isn’t a right answer here. As they say, the best defense is a good
offense; building your character to dish out damage instead of taking it
means that he or she will kill enemies faster and give them fewer chances to
put damage on him or her. On the other hand, you’ll find that even 1 or 2
points of extra Armor Class often results in a disproportionate reduction in
the amount of damage your character takes from enemy attacks. It’s really up
to you.
189
Chapter 16: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear

Speed versus protection
Heavy armor slows your character down, but protects him or her better from
attack. When you’re weighing armor choices, you need to decide if you care
about having your character’s movement reduced by wearing heavy armor.
Once again, this is largely a matter of personal choice. However, there is an
important factor you should consider: Heavy armor limits the defensive value
of a high Dexterity score. This is reflected in the armor’s Max Dex value. If your
character has a high Dexterity, you should think twice before you choose a suit
of armor that slows your character down and prevents him or her from getting
the full advantage of that high Dexterity score. Similarly, if your character has a
poor Dexterity score, you might as well choose the heaviest armor you can
find, because your Dexterity won’t be helping your AC anyway.
Table 16-2 provides an overview of the best armor choices by class. The rows
for beginning characters assume that you only have 50 gp to spend on armor.
After your character has had a successful adventure or two, he or she can
afford better armor, so you should upgrade to the armor choices listed in the
advanced character rows.

Fast armor choices are types of armor that don’t penalize movement. Slow
armor choices reduce movement to 2⁄3 or 3⁄4 normal; if you’re playing a human,
your character’s base speed is 30 feet per move, but if the character is wear-
ing heavy armor, he or she can only cover 20 feet per move. (Halflings and
gnomes are reduced from 20 feet to 15 feet.)
190
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

If you’re playing a dwarf, you don’t care about the distinction between fast and
slow armor types. Dwarves get to ignore the movement penalty for wearing
heavy armor, so unless you’re playing a dwarf with a very high Dexterity score,
your character might as well wear the heaviest armor he or she can afford.
Everything Else Your Character 
Is Carrying
Your choices of armor and weapons are important, but they’re not all that’s
involved in equipping your character. Dungeon exploration requires a lot of
specialized gear, and you’ll want to make sure that your character is carrying
everything he or she will need to survive in the hostile environment of a 
monster-filled dungeon.
Don’t forget that you’ve got a ready-made equipment package waiting for you
in each character class description in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook.
Even if you decide to shop for your character yourself in Chapter 7 of the
Player’s Handbook, you might want to take a look at the recommended equip-
ment packages for your character as a source of ideas.
Watch out! You might not realize it, but your character class might demand
specialized gear to accomplish its basic purpose. There are three prime
examples of this:
 Clerics require a holy symbol (1 gp or 25 gp) in order to cast most of
their spells.
 Rogues require a set of thieves’ tools (30 gp) to avoid taking a penalty on
Disable Device and Open Lock skill checks.
 Sorcerers require a spell component pouch (5 gp) in order to cast many
of their spells.
191
Chapter 16: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear
Armor choices for everyone else
Players who have characters of other classes
have some different choices to weigh when pick-
ing out armor. Here are a few quick guidelines:
 Barbarian: Choose the fast fighter option.
 Bard: Same as the rogue.
 Druid: Druids should choose leather armor
or hide armor, depending on whether you
want your character to be fast or slow (but
better protected).
 Monk: Don’t wear armor, it interferes with a
monk’s special abilities.
 Paladin: Same as fighter.
 Ranger: Choose the fast fighter option.
 Wizard: Same as sorcerer.

At the very minimum, make sure your character’s miscellaneous equipment
includes the noted item if you’re playing a member of that class. Not many
DMs will check you on this, but if your DM does, you need to be able to prove
that yes, your sorcerer is carrying the material components for the jump
spell, and no, he or she is not going to get stuck on the wrong side of the
chasm when the angry troll attacks.
Useful gear
These things won’t make your character fight better, but they’re darned
useful for successful dungeon exploration. Every adventurer should carry a
light source, a rope, and a useful tool or two such as a grappling hook, crow-
bar, hammer and pitons, flint and steel, and so on. Not everyone in the party
needs to carry one of each of these things — divvy out these implements
among the party.
A light source is particularly important, because most races can’t see a thing
in complete darkness. You’ve got four choices: torch, lantern, sunrod, or
magic (a light spell, daylight spell, or continual flame spell). Magic is a good
emergency measure, but unless you want your character to prepare a lot of
light spells (and you don’t — your character has better things to do with
spells), you’ll find that it just doesn’t last long enough.
Of the nonmagical alternatives, torches are heavy and don’t light up a very
large area, but they’re cheap. Lanterns are more expensive but provide
better light and usually last longer. In addition, you can set all kinds of things
on fire with a few flasks of lamp oil. Trust us. We’ve seen it done. Your best
non-magical alternative is probably the sunrod. Sunrods are alchemical
devices that provide a bright, long-lasting light without the need for oil.
They’re expensive (2 gp apiece) but give six hours of illumination at a time.
You’ll find them on page 128 of the Player’s Handbook.
Oh, and one more thing: Don’t forget the rope. Every member of the party
should carry at least 50 feet, preferably 100 feet or more, of rope. Too many
dungeons feature difficult vertical obstacles to skimp on the rope. With enough
rope, only one character in the party needs to be a good climber — everybody
else can follow the best climber after he or she fixes a rope in place.
Write it down and forget it
Ever been camping? If so, you’ve probably got half an idea of what your char-
acter likely goes through every day when he or she is off exploring vast
wildernesses or delving for weeks into a fearsome dungeon. Anybody going
away from civilization for a few days carries something to sleep on or in,
food, water, camp tools, and so on.
192
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

So, just for form’s sake, you should probably write a few things on your char-
acter sheet like, “backpack, bedroll, 3 days’ rations, 2 waterskins, flint and
steel.” (Altogether, they cost 6 gp, 1 sp, and weigh 18 pounds.) There. That’s
all it takes. The vast majority of Dungeon Masters will never challenge you on
this, and you’ll never actually concern yourself with this mundane gear again.
But you’ll be able to say that your character has it.
You might be tempted to write down a whole general store worth of tools,
rations, special items, and miscellaneous junk, but remember — your charac-
ter needs to carry everything. Check page 162 in the Player’s Handbook, and
you’ll see that characters have a finite limit on how much weight they can
carry. Again, not many DMs will think to enforce this rule, but some do, so
don’t be embarrassed by being caught with 860 pounds of gear on your 13
Strength rogue.
Improving Weapons and Armor
Your character’s equipment at 1st level is nothing remarkable. Your character
hasn’t yet found the great piles of treasure that will let him or her buy really
good armor or powerful magic weapons. But within a level or two, you’re going
to want to upgrade your character’s weapons and armor to the best arms he or
she can afford to own. In DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, your character doesn’t keep trea-
sure; he or she spends it to buy better weapons and armor so that he or she
can find even bigger treasures and buy even better weapons and armor.
Better armor
You’ve probably already picked the best nonmagical weapon for your charac-
ter that he or she can afford, but 1st-level characters generally start with
pretty crummy armor. With only 150 gp or so to spend, you just can’t buy a
decent suit of armor. Early in your fighter or cleric’s career, you will want to
trade in his or her scale mail (50 gp) for banded mail (250 gp). After that, buy
into full plate armor (1,500 gp) or a mithral chain shirt (1,150 gp). (See the
section, “Magical arms and armor,” for more about mithral.)
Masterwork
Between normal weapons and armor and magical weapons and armor, you
find masterwork items — non-magical weapons and armor of superior crafts-
manship. Masterwork weapons cost 300 gp more than normal, but give a +1
on attack rolls. Masterwork armor costs 150 gp more than normal armor, but
reduces the armor check penalty by 1 point. Depending on the type of armor
your character is wearing, this may or may not be significant; you may want
to simply wait and buy magical armor for your character when you can.
193
Chapter 16: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear

Magical arms and armor
The best way to improve your character’s attack rolls and AC is to get his or
her hands on a good magical weapon and a suit of magical armor. Magical
weaponry is expensive stuff, but you’ll find that you absolutely need it if your
character is going to have a fighting chance of dealing with the game’s more
dangerous monsters. See Chapter 20 for more details.
Magical weapons carry a bonus to attack and damage rolls, ranging from +1
to +5 or more. So when you hear someone at the table boasting about his +3
sword, what he’s saying is that his character has a sword that gives a +3
bonus on attack and damage rolls. That’s a good sword. A +1 weapon costs
2,000 gp more than a masterwork version of that same weapon — so a +1
greatsword costs 2,350 gp (50 gp for the greatsword, 300 gp for masterwork,
and 2,000 gp for the +1 enchantment).
Magical armor carries a bonus to AC ranging from +1 to +5 or more. So a suit
of chainmail normally provides an AC bonus of 5, but a suit of +2 chainmail
gives an AC bonus of 7. Magic armor with an enhancement bonus of +1 costs
1,000 gp more than a masterwork suit of armor of that same type — so a suit
of +1 chainmail costs 1,300 gp (150 gp for chainmail, 150 gp for masterwork
armor, and 1,000 gp for the bonus).
In addition to magical armor, your character can have armor made out of
mithral, a superior alloy that is strong as steel but much lighter. It’s not magi-
cal, but it’s darned handy. Mithral armor counts as armor one category
lighter than normal, and it reduces armor check penalties by 2. So a mithral
chain shirt provides a +4 AC bonus, with an armor check penalty of 0. Many
characters wind up with magical mithral chain shirts, because it’s simply the
best light armor your character can buy. A mithral chain shirt costs 1,150 gp,
and a +1 mithral chain shirt costs 2,150 gp. See page 284 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.

Chapter 17
Choosing Spells
In This Chapter
 Learning sorcerer spells
 Picking out your sorcerer’s spell path
 Choosing cleric domains
 Selecting cleric spell loadouts
S
pells are the lifeblood of characters who use magic. Just like a skilled
fighter might master a particular weapon or defeat his or her foes with a
deadly combination attack, a sorcerer or cleric quickly learns to use spells as
his or her weapons. A fighter naturally invests a lot of time and thought in
picking out the right weapon for his or her style of combat. Likewise, a spell-
caster has to pick out spells with just as much care and forethought.
In this chapter, we tell you about the various opportunities and restrictions
you face in choosing your character’s spells. We also show you some basic
sorcerer spell paths (sets of spells your sorcerer can acquire as he or she
gains levels) and some sample cleric spell loadouts (suites of spells your
cleric can prepare for the day’s adventuring).
If you’re playing a fighter or rogue, you can skip this chapter. Your character
doesn’t cast spells, so you don’t need to make any decisions here.
Casting Spells as a Sorcerer
As a sorcerer, spells are 90 percent of your character’s strengths. A sorcerer
can’t fight well, can’t take a lot of damage, and feat and skill selections just
aren’t that impressive. But your sorcerer might be the most powerful charac-
ter in the game, because no other characters have the sorcerer’s ability to
defeat a super-tough monster or a whole roomful of bad guys with a single
well-timed blow.
Sorcerer spells are organized into spell levels, ranging from 0 to 9. As your
character rises in level, he or she gains access to ever more powerful spells —
and your character can use them more often, too. For example, a 1st-level 

sorcerer can cast five 0-level and three 1st-level spells per day, but a 6th-
level sorcerer can cast six 0-level, six 1st-level, five 2nd-level, and three 3rd-level
spells per day. (You might notice that your character level, also referred to as
caster level, does not correlate to the maximum spell level; remember to keep
character level and spell level separate. They’re not the same thing.)
You’ll find the spells-per-day progression on Table 3-16, on page 52 of the
Player’s Handbook. On page 54 of the Player’s Handbook, Table 3-17 tells you
how many spells of which spell levels your sorcerer knows, based on experi-
ence level. Finally, don’t forget to check back to Table 1-1 on page 8 of the
Player’s Handbook to see whether or not your character’s Charisma score
entitles him or her to bonus spells per day. A sorcerer with a high Charisma
gets to cast more spells per day than a sorcerer with a mediocre Charisma.
To use a spell in game play, you simply tell the DM that your character is
casting a spell. In combat, you’ll have to wait for your character’s turn to
come up. As your sorcerer casts spells, he or she uses up spell slots of the
appropriate level. So, if you’re playing a 6th-level sorcerer and you have your
character cast lightning bolt twice in a fierce battle, you’ve used up two of
your character’s three 3rd-level spells for the day — you only have one use of
lightning bolt left. You can’t refresh spell slots until your character has an
opportunity to rest for eight hours. Usually, this means the party retreats
from the dungeon and circles the wagons for a time while your character
recharges his or her magic for the next day.
Learning spells
Playing a sorcerer has two advantages over playing a wizard: Your
sorcerer gets more spells per day than a wizard, and you don’t have
to fix spell selection in advance. In other words, your sorcerer can
use a 3rd-level spell slot to cast any 3rd-level spell he or she knows;
you don’t have to decide in advance which of your character’s
3rd-level spells you want to be available for the day.
The downside to playing a sorcerer is that your character’s
total repertoire of spells will be much more limited than a
wizard’s. A 6th-level wizard might know a dozen 3rd-level
spells, and then choose to memorize the two he deems most
likely to be useful for any particular day. A 6th-level sorcerer
will be able to use three 3rd-level spells in the same day, but she
knows only one 3rd-level spell. Sorcerers have no ability to adapt
their spell capacity to the particular challenges they face today.
The upshot of all this is that you will want to pick your character’s
spells with care. At 1st level, your sorcerer knows only four 
0-level spells and two 1st-level spells. Every time your 
character gains a level, he or she gains a small number of
new spells known.
196
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

You’ll find a complete list of sorcerer (and wizard) spells on page 192–196 of
the Player’s Handbook. Sorcerers and wizards make use of the same spell list.
Building your sorcerer’s spell selection
Every sorcerer builds his or her own spell selection level by level. Want to
play a fire sorcerer? Take a lot of fire spells. Want to play a mind-bending
enchanter? Take a lot of enchantment spells. It’s really up to you. However,
for the sake of illustrating a couple of the possible paths you might choose,
we provide three sorcerer spell paths — sets of level-by-level spell picks that
can serve as a guide for choosing your own sorcerer’s spells.
Like the feat ladders we discuss in Chapter 14, the spell paths require you to
make a basic decision about what kind of spellcaster you want to play. There
are dozens of good answers to this question, but we focus on three:
 Blaster: A sorcerer whose spell repertoire is geared toward dealing
damage to enemies. The blaster is the simplest sorcerer to play. Choose a
lot of spells that simply deal damage, and select defensive spells and util-
ity spells only after you’ve established good offense at each spell level.
 Buffer: A sorcerer who learns a lot of spells that buff (or power up) his or
her teammates. You give up a little of your character’s offensive potential
to dramatically increase the capabilities of everyone around your sorcerer.
197
Chapter 17: Choosing Spells
Sorcerer or wizard?
When you decide to try out some of the harder
character classes, you’ll find that the wizard’s
spellcasting ability is very similar to the sor-
cerer’s. Here’s a quick look at the key differences:
 Wizards know many more spells; in fact,
they’re not limited in the number of spells
they know. However, they can only prepare
(or memorize) a few spells of each spell
level per day.
 Wizards must commit each spell slot to a
particular spell at the beginning of the day.
Wizards can’t choose to reuse the same
spell over and over unless they plan ahead
by preparing that spell multiple times.
 Wizards gain access to more powerful
spells faster than the sorcerer. However,
sorcerers can use their spells more often.
Most experienced players feel that a wizard is 
a stronger spellcaster than a sorcerer. There’s 
no doubt that the wizard is more flexible and has
many more options at his or her fingertips.
However, for a beginning player, a wizard is a very
daunting choice, especially if you’re starting off in
a mid-level game. On the other hand, even a rela-
tive neophyte can manage a mid-level sorcerer
with little trouble. And sorcerers have a superior
ability to dish out attack spell after attack spell, if
the situation calls for it. At the end of the day, the
two choices are reasonably well balanced; go with
whichever character class appeals to you more.

 Trickster: A sorcerer who chooses spells that provide versatility, creative
approaches to defeating encounters without fighting, and general confu-
sion and frustration to the enemy. Trickster spells tend to be all-or-
nothing; either they win the encounter outright, or they prove ineffective.
Most sorcerers will have some ability to “jump tracks” in the course of a
fight. For example, every sorcerer should have some damage-dealing spells,
so every sorcerer can be a blaster for a fight if need be.
To use the spell paths in Tables 17-1 through 17-3, all you have to remember
is that your sorcerer knows every spell given for his or her character level,
plus all the spells for all previous levels. In other words, the lists are cumula-
tive; if you’re playing a 5th-level sorcerer, your character knows every spell
listed for sorcerer levels 1 through 5.
The blaster
The advantage of playing a blaster is that all your character’s efforts directly
contribute to the monster’s defeat. Most of your character’s spells (see Table
17-1) deal out damage by reducing hit points, just like the fighter’s sword and
the rogue’s sneak attack. Everyone in the party is working toward the same
goal, which is to reduce the monster’s hit points to zero as fast as possible. The
disadvantage of being a blaster is that there are much better ways to defeat
some monsters than by plowing through their hit points, and your sorcerer is
not going to be able to explore those alternatives.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Your first and foremost spell choice is magic missile. Your sorcerer will be
throwing magic missile throughout his or her whole career. At 4th level, your
character can learn 2nd-level spells, and the best damaging spell at 2nd level
is scorching ray. However, you could probably choose something else and
pick up scorching ray later, because scorching ray isn’t noticeably better than
magic missile until your character reaches 7th level.
At 6th level, your sorcerer’s power ramps up tremendously when he or she
gains access to his or her first 3rd-level spell. Fireball simply destroys a lot of
low-level encounters that used to give your character trouble. Your sorcerer
wipes out whole roomfuls of orcs with fireball. This is one of the most signifi-
cant power-ups any character in the game enjoys at any level, so make the
most of it.
You’ll find that there aren’t many good direct-attack 4th-level spells. You may
want to choose polymorph, improved invisibility, or stoneskin instead of
Evard’s black tentacles; it’s your call. Wall of ice is a generally useful spell that
can help your character control the battlefield and wall off foes so that your
character or other party members can deal with them later.
Early in your sorcerer’s career, you should choose the feat Spell Focus (evo-
cation). You’re going to want your sorcerer’s fireball spells to be as effective
as possible.
The buffer
The buffer path (see Table 17-2) is rarely used for most sorcerers. Clerics
have a number of good buffing spells, and in most parties, your character can
safely leave that job to a cleric buddy. But if you’re playing the second sor-
cerer in an adventuring party, or your party doesn’t have a cleric, you’ll find
that your sorcerer’s spells can sometimes help his or her friends deal even
more damage than your character might have dished out with a flash-bang
spell like fireball or lightning bolt.

A buffer character begins with a spell selection similar to that of the blaster
sorcerer, because every sorcerer relies on magic missile. Mage armor can be
cast on your character’s friends, so a rogue buddy (or maybe a monk, druid,
or ranger, if one is in the party) would appreciate the no-encumbrance
defense offered by that spell.
At 4th level, your sorcerer gains the ability to cast the spell invisibility. This
offers a rogue friend a tremendous power up, because he can now manufacture
a sneak attack opportunity almost at will. There are several other good buff
spells at 2nd level that you should consider choosing, including bull’s strength,
bear’s endurance, cat’s grace, and blur. All are reasonable choices, but check to
see if the cleric in your party intends to use bull’s strength or bear’s endurance a
lot. There’s no sense in wasting one of your character’s precious spell choices
on a spell the party will have regular access to anyway through the cleric.
When your sorcerer reaches 6th level, you’ve got a hard choice to make: Do
you pick up haste right now, or do you shore up your character’s offense with
a spell like fireball or lightning bolt first? In the path we provide in Table 17-2,
we recommend beefing up your character’s offense first, because it’s been
neglected a bit — but haste is a very good choice too.
At 8th level, your sorcerer gets his or her first 4th-level spell. Your best
choices are polymorph, stoneskin, or improved invisibility. Stoneskin buffs your
character’s fighter friends, but rogues just love improved invisibility — and so
does your sorcerer, for that matter, because he or she gets to cast spells and
remain invisible. Go with improved invisibility first.
Because your sorcerer will often be casting spells of a limited duration, you
might want to consider choosing the Extend Spell metamagic feat. You’ll want
those power ups to stick around as long as possible.
The trickster
In many ways, the trickster spell path (see Table 17-3) is the strongest sor-
cerer build. These spells are devastating in effect. But there is a downside:
When the blaster sorcerer hits a foe with a lightning bolt, he’s guaranteed to do
200
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

some damage. If a trickster sorcerer tries suggestion on that same foe and the
enemy succeeds on his saving throw, nothing happens. In effect, the trickster
is trying to beat the encounter all on his own. He’s not cooperating with the
fighter and rogue to eliminate the target’s hit points; he’s competing with them
to see who knocks out the monster first.

0 — open/close; 4th — polymorph
9th
2nd — knock; 3rd — lightning bolt; 4th — improved 
invisibility
10th
0 — touch of fatigue; 5th — hold monster
As with the other spell paths, it’s hard not to start with magic missile. Sleep is
potentially the best 1st-level spell in the game, because it offers your sorcerer
a chance to take down a whole 1st-level encounter in one easy spell.
There aren’t many good offensive 2nd-level spells, so your 2nd-level choices
focus on delaying, confusing, and hindering the enemy. Invisibility offers
tremendous opportunity for mischief, and a rogue friend likes it, too.
When your sorcerer can cast 3rd-level spells, you have a great wealth of
spells to choose from. We like summon monster III and suggestion for the trick-
ster. The summon monster spells offer a great amount of versatility in picking
out the exact right monster to call for the situation your character is in;
chances are good you’ll find something on the list that will help your sorcerer
in almost any fight. Suggestion is a devastating weapon in the hands of a cre-
ative player; you can have your sorcerer entice foes to surrender, leave, give
up their stuff, or even fight each other with a little clever wording.
201
Chapter 17: Choosing Spells

At 8th level, your character picks up the single most useful spell in the game,
polymorph. There is no end to the utility of this spell. It’s offense, defense,
mobility, and disguise all in one spell.
Casting Spells as a Cleric
Building your sorcerer’s spell selection takes a little forethought, but then
runs quickly and easily in play. Unfortunately, the cleric is the exact opposite.
You don’t have to make many decisions about which spells you’ll gain on a
level-by-level basis, because your character knows all cleric spells. But you
have to decide which spells you want available to your cleric each day. And,
to complicate things even more, your cleric has the ability to ditch a pre-
pared spell and revert to a healing spell any time you like. So, you must con-
stantly evaluate your character’s current spell selection and decide which
spells to use up and when to use them.
Just like sorcerer spells, cleric spells are organized into spell levels, ranging
from 0 to 9. As your cleric gains levels, he or she has access to ever more
powerful spells, which he or she can use more often than before.
You’ll find the cleric’s spells per day progression on Table 3-6 (page 31 of the
Player’s Handbook). If your cleric has a good Wisdom score (12 or better),
your character gains bonus spells per day based on his or her Wisdom score;
see Table 1-1 on page 8 of the Player’s Handbook.
2+1 isn’t 3?
You might wonder why the cleric spell table lists things like “2+1” as spells
per day instead of just 3. There’s a reason: This is a reminder that you must
choose one spell per spell level from your cleric’s domain spells, while you
can select the remaining spells at that spell level from the general cleric spell
202

Feat ladders and spell paths
You might be wondering how these spell path-
ways coincide with the feat ladders discussed
in Chapter 14. Here are the best interactions of
feats and spell paths to remember:
 Attack sorcerer: Choose the blaster or
trickster spell paths.
 Team buff sorcerer: Choose the buffer spell
path.
 Survival sorcerer: Choose any spell path.

list. So, if your character knows 2+1 2nd-level spells, you pick two 2nd-level
cleric spells and one 2nd-level spell from either of your character’s two
chosen cleric domains.
Choosing domains
At 1st level, you must make a couple of fundamental choices that will forever
dictate your cleric’s spell access. You pick two cleric domains from which
your character will be able to cast spells. You will always have access to the
general list of cleric spells, but you have to decide which two (of the 22 avail-
able) domains your character will be able to cast from in addition to the gen-
eral cleric spell list.
There are two ways to go about picking domains. You can choose a deity 
for your cleric from Table 3-7 on page 32 of the Player’s Handbook and then
select two of the domains listed for that deity (see Table 17-4 for our sug-
gested domains for each deity), or you can go straight to the list of domains
in Chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook (pages 185–189) and pick any two
domains you think go together well.
Choosing a domain gives your cleric a modest special power of some kind,
and access to a number of spells — some of which may only be available to
clerics who choose that domain, others of which may also be available to
druids, sorcerers, and wizards, or might appear in the general cleric spell list.

Preparing cleric spells
Preparing your cleric’s spells requires two steps. First, you choose your char-
acter’s general cleric spells from the list on pages 183–185 of the Player’s
Handbook. Then, you choose which domain spells you want your character to
prepare for the day. Clerics only get a single domain spell at each spell level
per day, so the fact that your character has access to two domains means that
you will need to compare the two domains in question spell level by spell level
to decide which one you want your cleric to take a spell from that day. You’ll
find the domain spell lists on pages 185–189 of the Player’s Handbook.
204
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Clerics and healing spells
Clerics have a special ability called sponta-
neous casting. Whenever clerics are about to
cast a spell, they can choose to ditch the spell
they had prepared in that spell slot and substi-
tute a cure spell of the same level or lower. For
example, say that your cleric had spiritual
hammer prepared as one of his or her 2nd-level
cleric spells. You can simply strike this spell off
your cleric’s list of readied spells, and your
character can then cast cure moderate wounds
or cure light wounds instead. Only clerics of
good or neutral alignment can do this; evil cler-
ics use spontaneous casting to convert to inflict
wounds spells instead.
What this means is that your cleric doesn’t ever
have to actually prepare cure spells. Any spell
your cleric has prepared for the day is a poten-
tial cure spell. You simply decide on the fly
which of your cleric’s prepared spells you want
to lose in order to power up some healing for
your character or other party members.

For example, say that your cleric has the Good and War domains. At 2nd
level, the Good domain spell is aid, while the War domain spell is spiritual
weapon. You can use your cleric’s domain spell slot (the odd “+1” on the
cleric class table) to prepare either aid or spiritual weapon, but not both.
Now, here’s where it gets really crazy: Many spells on the domain lists also
appear on the base cleric spell list. In the example above, aid and spiritual
weapon are both spells that are also found in the general list of 2nd-level
cleric spells. You are free to use your cleric’s general spell slots (the 1, or 2,
or 3 before the +1 on the table) to select these spells, if you like. So, your
cleric could conceivably prepare spiritual weapon three, four, or five times in
a single day — once from his or her domain list, and the rest from his or her
general spell slots.
Cleric spell loadouts
To help you quickly choose a set of useful cleric spells, we’ve created three
separate spell loadouts, described in the following sections. Unlike the feat
ladders or sorcerer spell paths, these loadouts are not exclusive paths —
when you’re playing a cleric, you can choose which spells you want your
cleric to prepare for that day. If you want your cleric to be ready for a lot of
melee combat one day, pick the combat monster loadout. If you want your
cleric to be ready to fix any imaginable predicament his or her friends get
into the next day, drop the combat monster loadout and go with the master
healer suite of spell choices instead.
To use the loadout, simply select the spells indicated for your cleric’s level
(and all spells from previous levels, as well) when you choose which spells
your cleric will prepare for the day.
The loadouts do not account for high Wisdom scores and bonus spells. Your
cleric is certain to get some amount of bonus spells, but you should use
those bonus slots to pick any darn spell you want. Similarly, these loadouts
don’t account for the domain spell at each spell level. Don’t forget to choose
your cleric’s domain spells in addition to general cleric spells.
Combat monster cleric spell loadout
Choose to have your cleric prepare the selection of spells in Table 17-5 if you
want your character to wade into the fight with his or her mace swinging.
The spells on this path work especially well with the melee cleric feat ladder
(see Chapter 14), but any cleric can become a dangerous melee opponent
with a few of the right spells.

10th

* Does not include domain spells or bonus spells for high Wisdom score.
Your cleric’s key battle spells are shield of faith, divine favor, and divine
power. If your cleric can prepare for a fight by casting one or two of these
spells, you’ll find that your character fights as well as (or even better than)
his or her fighter comrades.
With domain spells or bonus spells for your character’s Wisdom score, you
may want to choose some good “fixing” spells such as remove fear or lesser
restoration, or spells to buff your character’s allies — greater magic weapon is
an excellent, long-lasting spell that can significantly help comrades’ attacks.
Don’t be afraid to use your cleric’s extra spells to take multiple iterations of
key spells; if your character gets into several fights in the course of one day
of adventuring, he or she may cast shield of faith or divine favor in each one.
If you like this spell loadout, you’ll find that the Strength and War domains
offer the most useful domain spells. The Destruction domain is also worth
considering.
Master healer cleric spell loadout
The spell loadout in Table 17-6 is designed to counter many of the various
afflictions that can befall an adventuring party fighting monsters armed with
poison, ability drain, and various supernatural and magical attacks. Any
cleric can help his or her allies get hit points back, but fixing someone who’s
lost a few points of Strength or Constitution to a nasty poison of some kind
requires some advance preparation. As the master healer, your character is
going to keep the rest of the party operating at peak efficiency.
206
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Clerics who follow the Turn Expert or Spellcasting Cleric feat ladders gener-
ally do well with this spell loadout. However, don’t rule it out if you’re playing
a melee-oriented cleric; the trick with this slate of spells is that you don’t
know if or when your cleric will use them, so he or she should have a good
offensive capability (such as beating foes silly with a mace) to fall back on if
he or she doesn’t find much opportunity for healing.
To be honest, you have to be a special kind of player to be happy with focus-
ing your efforts on helping your character’s friends, as opposed to battling
the monsters with your character. If you choose to play a healing-heavy
cleric, you will find that you have few discretionary actions in the course of
the game. Many of your turns will be sucked up in tending to your character’s
allies’ injuries. Other players will often take it for granted that you’re willing to
give up your turn in order to keep their characters in the fight. If that doesn’t
sound like fun to you, then you should take the combat monster or battle
caster loadouts for your cleric instead.

You should adjust your spell selection to account for the enemies you expect
your cleric to face. For example, if you know that your cleric is going to enter a
temple haunted by shadows (monsters that drain Strength), you should cer-
tainly pick extra lesser restoration spells in order to fix up Strength-damaged
friends.
207
Chapter 17: Choosing Spells

With bonus spells and domain spells, your cleric should probably prepare
some offensive or team-buff spells, such as searing light, greater magic
weapon, or shield of faith.
Domains that naturally steer your cleric toward the master healer spell load-
out include Healing (naturally) and either Luck or Protection.
Battle caster cleric spell loadout
The selection of spells in Table 17-7 allows your cleric to stand back and deal
damage from a distance. In general, a sorcerer will beat a cleric at simply
handing out damage with spells, but with the right spell selections, a cleric
can be nearly as effective as a sorcerer in spell duels.
Clerics who follow the Spellcasting Cleric feat ladder will do well with this
spell loadout.

The one place where the cleric’s offensive potential matches that of the 
sorcerer is with the various summon monster spells. They take a long time to
cast, but they offer tremendous tactical flexibility, and they allow your cleric
to take control of the battle by swamping the battlefield with more allies. This
strategy is especially effective if your character has the Augment Summoning
feat.

209
Chapter 17: Choosing Spells
Spell selections for other characters
Three other character classes are spellcasters
from the get-go: the bard, the druid, and the
wizard. Here are a few quick tips for spell selec-
tion if you choose to play a character of one of
these classes:
 Bard: Your character learns spells like the
sorcerer — you choose a small number of
spells that your character knows, but he or
she can use them any time he or she has spell
slots available. As a 1st-level bard, your char-
acter only knows 0-level spells: We suggest
choosing daze, detect magic, mage hand, and
read magic. At 2nd level, your character gains
access to 1st-level bard spells, which are
much more interesting. You get to choose two
of these for your character; disguise self and
sleep are pretty good choices.
 Druid: Your character uses spells like the
cleric — he or she has access to all the spells
on the druid list and can customize his or 
her picks every day. However, druids don’t 
use domains, and they can’t spontaneously
convert to healing spells. Instead, they can 
lose prepared spells to cast summon nature’s 
ally spells, so your character always has an
offensive option to fall back on. The druid’s
best 1st-level spells are cure light wounds,
charm animal, produce flame, and speak with
animals.
 Wizard: Your character begins with a small
subset of the 0-level and 1st-level sor-
cerer/wizard spells in his or her spellbook.
Each day, he or she prepares spells from
the spellbook. Good 1st-level spells to have
in your character’s spellbook include charm
person, mage armor, magic missile, shield,
and sleep.

Use domain spells and bonus spells to pick up some miscellaneous defenses,
such as resist energy and shield of faith. Your cleric can easily share these
spells with fellow adventurers, and the efficient distribution of magical power
from clerics and sorcerers to rogues and fighters is one of the secret success
strategies for the game.
A number of cleric domains lend themselves to the battle caster spell load-
out. Some of the better ones include Death, Destruction, Fire, Good, Sun, and
Water. (Water is especially sneaky; few players recognize how good its spells
are at higher levels, because no one ever takes the Water domain.)

Advancing Your Character
In This Chapter
 Discovering how your character earns experience points
 Examining what happens when your character gains a level
 Understanding multiclassing
 Exploring prestige classes
C
haracters in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are not static. They grow and
develop the longer you play the game. That’s one of the key aspects of
the game — like the heroes of a novel, movie, or television series, your char-
acters learn, grow, and are influenced by past and present events.
In this chapter, we explore the concept of experience points (XP) and gaining
levels, examining how and in what ways your character improves. We also
look at multiclassing, an option that allows your character to experiment
with different class features by taking levels in another class. Finally, we look
at prestige classes, the pinnacle that every character can strive to achieve.
Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook goes into greater depth on experience
points and multiclassing. Check out pages 58–60 of the Player’s Handbook
after you read through this chapter. Page 36–41 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide
provides the tables and reward options that DMs use to award XP. Finally,
you can find a collection of prestige classes in Chapter 6 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.
Gaining Experience Points
Experience points, or XP, measure a character’s accomplishments. They repre-
sent both training and learning by doing. In the fantasy worlds of D&D, experi-
ence has a direct correlation to power. Characters earn experience points 
by defeating opponents and otherwise overcoming the challenges that the
Dungeon Master places before them. When a character has earned a specific
number of XP, as detailed on Table 3-2 on page 22 of the Player’s Handbook (a
portion of the table is shown in Table 18-1, as well), he or she gains a new level.

Where does XP come from?
Every monster and opponent in the game has a Challenge Rating (CR). This
CR is a rating of how easy or difficult a monster is to overcome. Every mon-
ster stat block includes the monster’s CR. Traps and other obstacles can also
be assigned CRs, as described in Chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
The Dungeon Master can adjust the CRs (and thereby the XP award) based
on circumstances and unusual situations.
The DM decides when a challenge has been overcome. Usually, this means
when a battle has been won or a trap disarmed, but clever players can come
up with all kinds of ways for their characters to overcome the challenge of
the moment. If the party successfully slips by the hobgoblins guarding the
corridor by using stealth and clever distractions, the DM can determine that
the characters have overcome this challenge and reward them experience
points accordingly.
All characters that take part in an encounter should gain XP for that encounter.
Remember that encounters come in three forms: a challenge, a combat, or a
roleplaying encounter that is integral to the plot of the adventure. If a character
212
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
What is a Challenge Rating?
Every monster or obstacle the player characters
have to deal with in an adventure has a Challenge
Rating (CR). The CR suggests the average level of
a party of adventurers for which one creature of
a particular CR would make an encounter mod-
erately difficult. In other words, with reasonable
luck and a bit of skill, an average party should
overcome a creature or obstacle of their CR with
some damage and expenditure of resources.
When we talk about an average party, we mean
four player characters. (Your gaming group, of
course, might make up a larger or smaller adven-
turing party.) 
A 4th-level party, for example, should be able to
get through an encounter with a CR 4 monster
or trap a little beat up and a few resources
expended but without suffering any casualties.

dies or is knocked out prior to the start of an encounter, he or she earns no XP,
even if the rest of the party successfully overcomes the encounter. DMs usually
award XP at the end of an adventure, though granting awards at the end of
encounters or game sessions works too, as long as level advancement happens
between adventures.
For the Dungeon Master
The DM usually awards experience points at the end of an adventure, but some
DMs dole out awards at the end of a game session. Training and advancement,
however, should still take place between adventures (see the “Advancing a
Level” section). To determine the XP award for an encounter, follow these steps
(which are described more fully in Chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide):
1. Determine each player character’s level. Remember to include only
those characters that took part in the encounter.
2. Determine each defeated monster’s Challenge Rating (CR).
3. Cross-reference one character’s level with the Challenge Rating for
each defeated monster on Table 2-6 on page 38 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide to find the base XP award. 
4. Divide the base XP award by the number of characters in the party.
The result is the amount of XP that one character receives for helping
to overcome the monster.
5. Add up all the XP awards for all the monsters the character helped
defeat.
6. Repeat this process for each player character that participated in the
encounter.
Advancing a Level
Your character can advance to the next level when your XP total reaches the
minimum amount needed, according to Table 3-2 in the Player’s Handbook.
Regdar, for example, can go up from 1st to 2nd level when he accumulates at
least 1,000 XP. Going up a level provides a number of immediate benefits that
demonstrate that the character has learned and improved in some way.
Imagine that your character spends time between adventures training, study-
ing, and practicing his or her skills. Even if your character achieves the neces-
sary XP milestone, he or she can’t go up a level in the middle of an adventure.
In game terms, this means that you have to wait until the adventure or game
session ends before you can level up your character; in the D&D world, your
character has to return to a safe place to train before he or she can make use
of the knowledge and experience gained in the course of adventuring.

Chapter 18: Advancing Your Character

Every class has a table that describes class features and statistics that
become available and increase as your character advances in levels. Refer to
the tables in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook. When your character has
earned the necessary XP to go up a level, grab your character sheet and your
Player’s Handbook, and follow these steps:
1. Choose the class in which to apply your new experience level.
When your character qualifies for a new level, decide which class you’re
going to take that level in. Most players select their characters’ class
during character creation and stick with it for the rest of their charac-
ters’ adventuring careers. The best fighter, for example, takes all his or
her levels in the fighter class. However, you may have other reasons for
diverging as your character advances levels. (See the section called
“Multiclassing,” later in this chapter, for more information.)
2. Adjust your base attack bonus modifiers.
If the new class level indicates that your base attack bonus increases,
record this on your character sheet and adjust your attacks accordingly. 
3. Adjust your base save bonuses.
If the new class level indicates that your base saves increase, adjust
your character sheet accordingly.
4. Adjust your ability score.
When your character attains 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th character
level (as opposed to class level — see the nearby sidebar, “Character
level versus class level”), choose an ability and increase its score by 1
point. Check Table 1-1 on page 8 of the Player’s Handbook to see if modi-
fiers or scores associated with that ability need to be adjusted.
214
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
How high can you go?
How high can your character advance in level?
That depends. The core DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
rulebooks provide for 20 levels of play. For those
who want to explore adventures beyond 20th
level, check out the Epic Level Handbook. How
far you advance really comes down to the type
of campaign your Dungeon Master wants to
run. Some campaigns continue for years, with
characters advancing to 20th level and beyond.
Others run for a few months, reach a satisfying
conclusion, and then the DM kicks off some-
thing new. This gives everyone an opportunity
to try new character and class options, and for
the DM to try a new world on for size.

5. Increase your hit points.
Roll the Hit Die indicated for your class, add your character’s Constitution
modifier, and add the total to your hit points. Your character will always
gain at least 1 hit point upon level advancement, even if a Constitution
penalty and a low roll would indicate otherwise.
6. Increase your skill points.
You get an allotment of skill points based on class and Intelligence modi-
fier. (And humans always get 1 bonus skill point every level.) Remember
that you can buy class skills for 1 point per rank, but 1 skill point only
buys 1⁄2 rank in cross-class skills. Your maximum rank in any class skill is
your character’s level +3; for cross-class skills, it’s half that number.
7. Choose your new feat.
When your character attains 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th character
levels, you gain one feat of your choice. Make sure that your character
meets any prerequisites the feat may require.
8. Get your new spells.
Spellcasting characters gain the ability to cast more spells as they
advance. In Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook, check the Spells per Day
section of your character’s class table to see if your character can now
cast more spells per day. If you’re playing a sorcerer or bard, also check
the Spells Known table to see if your character can learn new spells.
9. Acquire your new class features.
Finally, check your class table (in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook) to
see if the new level provides any new class features. These might include
bonus feats, special attacks, or new powers.
215
Chapter 18: Advancing Your Character
Character level versus class level
Character level refers to the total number of
levels in all classes. Character level is used to
determine when feats and ability score improve-
ments become available. 
Class level is your character’s level in a particular
class. For a single-class character, character level
and class level are the same. When Regdar is a
4th-level fighter, he’s also a 4th level character. 
However, for a multiclass character that is a 2nd-
level fighter/2nd-level rogue, that character is a
4th-level character with two class levels of fighter
and two class levels of rogue. Such a character
would have more options for dealing with obsta-
cles, but would never equal Regdar’s pure power
as a fighter.

Multiclassing
As your character advances in level, you get to decide what class to advance
your character in. Most player characters stick with a single class throughout
their careers, because sticking with one track provides the easiest and most
rapid power advancement. You can, however, select a new class and combine
its features with those of your previous class. This is called multiclassing.
Multiclassing makes your character more versatile, but weakens your focus
and puts your character behind the power curve as compared to characters
that stick with a single class.
Page 59 of the Player’s Handbook describes multiclass characters and how to
add a second class. For more on multiclassing, see Chapter 22 of this book.
Prestige Classes
Prestige classes offer a special kind of multiclassing for characters of higher
levels. Prestige classes are specialized, focused classes that have requirements
that characters must meet before they can take levels in them. Requirements
can include a specific base attack bonus, a specific number of ranks in a specific
skill, a specific race, a specific alignment, or a specific feat. Prestige classes
are purely optional and must be approved by the Dungeon Master before you
decide to take levels in them. Some prestige classes might not fit into certain
campaigns, for example. 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides 17 prestige classes to choose from,
including the arcane archer, the blackguard, and the loremaster. See Chapter 6
of that volume for more information. Other D&D supplements also feature
prestige classes that you might want to add to your campaign.

D
UNGEONS & DRAGONS is a complex game that presents
your character with an infinite variety of challenges.
In this part of the book, you graduate from the basics of
how to play and how to create a character into the study of
how to play the game well. You can play the game at a basic
level (see the monster, hit the monster) and have plenty of
fun, but if you want to find out how to take on the toughest
opponents and win, how to forge your adventuring party
into a tight team of specialists who can take on any chal-
lenge, and how to immerse yourself in the imagination and
fun of the game, this part is for you.

Chapter 19
Handling Yourself in a Fight
In This Chapter
 Picking the right way to beat the monsters
 Building a combat strategy
 Using advanced tactics
 Maximizing your attacks
 Adapting your tactics to your foes
T
he point of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is to have fun, be creative, and
engage in a little healthy escapism. But D&D is a game, and just like any
game, you can play it well or you can play it poorly. Many people have a great
time making bad choices and exploring those consequences, but we’re guess-
ing that you want to play to win — or at least do your best to maximize your
character’s impact on the game.
There are two good ways to play the game smart: Build effective characters
(we talk more about that later in this book), and fight your best fight. Any
character can shine for a battle with some lucky combat rolls, but if you con-
sistently select the best and most efficient actions for your character round
after round, you won’t need lucky die rolls to excel.
In this chapter, we tell you about the right way to approach battles and
encounters, and we show you how to come up with a winning strategy for
almost any fight.
Choosing the Right Weapon for the Job
This doesn’t mean carrying around a bag of holding full of magic weapons 
and pulling out the most effective one for each foe. This means finding your
enemy’s weakness and targeting it. This strategy goes all the way back to Sun
Tzu: Don’t throw strength at strength if there’s a better option available. Your
high-powered fighter might be able to cut his or her way through a roomful of
frost giants, but melee combat is what frost giants do best. You would be better
off to use magic to immobilize or defeat the frost giants, because giants gener-
ally can stand up to a lot more physical abuse than magical attacks.

The four basic strategies for defeating foes in the D&D game are hit point
damage, save-or-die spells, maneuver, and diplomacy.
Killing ’em slowly: Attacking hit points
Use melee attacks, ranged attacks, and damage-causing spells such as magic
missile or lightning bolt to reduce your opponents’ hit points to zero as fast as
possible. This strategy works best against foes with low hit points or foes
who don’t have much ability to hurt your character while the party chips
away at their hit points. It’s a bad strategy to use against beaters (big strong
monsters who frankly are seeking to mix it up with your party).
This is the default strategy for almost any monster; if you don’t know what
else to do, make attacks and knock down your enemy’s hit points. Sooner or
later, you’ll win.
Swinging for the fences: Save-or-die spells
Many spells are affectionately referred to as save-or-die spells. If a save-or-die
spell works, your character will screw up the enemy so bad he might as well
be dead even if the spell itself doesn’t kill him. Spells such as deep slumber,
hold person, disintegrate, or finger of death cer-
tainly fall into this category.
Most save-or-die spells don’t actually work
well with hit point ablation, because if your
character drops a monster that a fighter ally
has been attacking for a round or two, you’ve
effectively rendered the fighter’s earlier attacks
pointless. If you’re going to paralyze the troll on
round 4, why spend any actions at all hitting it in
rounds 1, 2, and 3? So if you’re using all-or-nothing spells
in a fight where your comrades are beating down the mon-
sters the hard way, at least make sure that you target fresh,
“un-hit-yet” monsters for your save-or-die effects.
Save-or-die spells work best on monsters with a significant
saving throw vulnerability that you can exploit. The
Monster Manual is the place where you can study 
up on what works best on each particular monster.
For example, giants usually have poor Will 
saves but great Fortitude saves. Don’t use finger
of death on a giant; you’re likely to waste the
spell. Use hold monster instead.
220
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Beating ’em with footwork: Maneuver
Many foes can be avoided through an artful maneuver, especially if your char-
acter or another in the party has potent magic at hand. If nothing else, you
might be able to maneuver your character into a position from which he or
she can attack a foe with no chance of being hit back. For example, if the
opponent is a powerful melee basher with no ranged attacks (say, a gray
render or purple worm), your character might be able to take to the air and
attack it safely with ranged weapons and spells.
The true coup of maneuver, of course, is to simply bypass a fight you don’t
need to fight. If the evil lord surrounds his castle with a moat of giant fiendish
crocodiles, why would you slog your way through the monsters when you
might go around, over, or through them without fighting? Spells such as
dimension door, teleport, and fly are obvious mechanisms for winning an
encounter through maneuver, but don’t overlook the rogue’s knack for sneak-
ing through dangerous places, or spells that disguise or hide your whole
party from your foes.
Maneuvering works best on enemies who are stuck in place. (There’s not
much point in avoiding a pack of hell hounds if they’ll just follow the party to
the next room and attack them there.) It’s also the best way for dealing with
enemies who are simply too dangerous to fight.
Winning with a smile: Negotiation
Sometimes you can simply talk your way past an obstacle. If your character is
facing a roomful of orc warriors, he or she might be able to convince them
that the adventuring party is far too dangerous to attack with a display of
astounding bravado (and a good Bluff or Intimidate check). Or your charac-
ter might persuade them that it’s in their own best interest to let the party
continue through the dungeon unmolested so that the party can deal with a
rival gang of monsters the orcs might want out of the way — a good use of
the Diplomacy skill.
Magic can be very helpful in getting your foot in the door with the negotia-
tion strategy. Spells such as charm person, suggestion, or charm monster can
go a long way toward convincing someone (or something) to talk instead of
fight.
Negotiation works best on intelligent adversaries, but don’t rule out negotiation
tactics against non-intelligent monsters. A druid’s or ranger’s wild empathy
ability can easily get a party of adventurers past a dangerous and ill-tempered
creature such as a dire bear or giant crocodile. And, even if you’re not playing
a druid or ranger, throwing a big haunch of meat to the evil warlord’s fiendish
dire wolf might serve as well as a bribe of gold would for an intelligent guardian.
221
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

Many Dungeon Masters will require you to attempt skill checks in skills such
as Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, or Intimidate in order to carry off a nego-
tiation strategy. However, some DMs will deliberately avoid using the skill
rules to resolve these encounters: They want you, the player, to explain
exactly what your character says, and then they’ll decide if they think you
were convincing enough for your character to succeed in his or her efforts to
talk to the monsters. Other DMs combine skill checks with roleplaying, letting
good rolls bolster weak roleplaying or vice-versa. Each method is a reason-
able way for the DM to handle a negotiation — you’ll just have to see which
way your DM prefers to play encounters like this.
Bugging out: Knowing when to retreat
Even the best D&D players tend to forget that running away is an option. Very
few challenges in the game are worth getting a player character killed for. If
the situation is so grim that it seems likely that one or more characters will
die, extricate the party from the battle and come back to fight another day —
after all player characters have healed up and made the right magical prepa-
rations for dealing with whatever dangerous adversary forced a retreat.
Warning signs that you should watch out for include:
 One or more player characters rendered helpless.
 Two or more player characters reduced to 50 percent hit points or less,
with no prospect of healing back up to full.
 Player character spellcasters down to 50 percent or less of their normal
spell capability (half their spell slots or prepared spells have been 
used up).
 Three straight rounds go by in a fight where no player character damages
an adversary.
Whether or not you heed these warning signs is up to you. Sometimes,
retreat is simply not an option. Other times, you might need to fight on past
the warning signs because you’ll put your character at greater risk in trying
to retreat than you would by trying to win the fight.
Putting It All Together: Developing 
Your Combat Strategy
Every time your character gets into a scrape, you should have an idea of
what you’re trying to accomplish and how you’re going to go about it. That
means formulating a combat strategy early in the fight. Here’s a quick and
dirty primer on combat strategy for you to use:
222
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

1. Define the situation: Identify what sort of fight you’re facing by figuring
out if anyone is surprised and what sort of terrain you’re fighting on.
When you’re determining surprise, you must figure out who got the
jump on whom. Do you even have a choice about this fight? Here are
some guidelines to keep in mind:
• We got ambushed: The bad guys jumped out of the darkness and
attacked your party without warning. Your first step should be to
limit the damage the monsters are dealing to the party by drawing
back or using defensive magic. Only when you’re sure that your
character or another player character in the party is not going to
get killed do you turn to serious offense.
• We just ran into them: Neither side has an advantage. These situa-
tions are dangerous, because you might not realize how much trou-
ble the party is in until you’re several rounds into the fight and you
don’t have any good escape options open. Fight defensively until
you know that it’s safe to shift over to offense.
• They’re in our way: The monsters are obstacles the party has to
get past, but you’ve got time to get ready for a fair fight. Use your
spellcaster’s buffing-up spells and try to make the fight distinctly
unfair by turning allies invisible, summoning monsters, or creeping
up to start the battle with a sneak attack.
• We ambushed them: You’ve got time to hide and set up a surprise
attack of your own. Lay down as much hurt as you can as fast as
you can, so that the monsters don’t get any real chance to fight
back.
Where are you fighting? Does the ground favor your party or the other
side? Does the party have an easy way to get out if things go bad?
Terrain affects combat in myriad ways. Here are some guidelines:
• Obstructed: You’re fighting in tight spaces or with little room to
maneuver. Make sure that you control the battlefield by using walls
and obstacles to keep enemies from getting around your character
or other characters in the party.
• Wide open: There’s no place to hide. If your party is faster than
the monsters, don’t let them close with the party until you’re
ready. If your party is slower, try to bog down your foes in melee
combat.
• Grossly unfair: Your party is hanging on a cliff, fighting against
harpies, fiendish giant eagles, or something else with wings. Back
off and try it again when you’ve taken steps to make it a fair fight.
2. Evaluate your foes: Study the monsters you’re facing and determine if
they’re battlers, ambushers, magic users, special attack users, or multi-
ple threats. Don’t forget to take a quick head count and determine if your
party is outnumbered. Take special note of the following characteristics:
223
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

• Battlers: They’re big, strong melee machines. Gangs of orc warriors,
evil fighters, ogres or trolls, or solitary hulks like gray renders or
stone giants are battlers.
• Ambushers: The monsters are dangerous when they catch your
party by surprise, but aren’t much for a stand-up fight.
• Magic users: The monsters attack with magic. Evil clerics or mad
wizards are clearly magic users, but so are monsters such as
demons and devils with dangerous spell-like abilities.
• Special attack users: The monster has a signature special attack
that does most of the damage. The medusa with its petrifying gaze
is a good example. Others include stirges (blood drain), many
undead (ability or energy drain), or harpies (beguiling song).
• Multiple threat: The monsters do several things well. Dragons are
both battlers and special attack users. Most demons and devils are
battlers and magic users.
• No threat: The monsters aren’t a real threat to your party. They
might outnumber the party, but they’re individually too weak to
hurt anyone in the party.
3. Choose the right tactic: Decide what method will give you the best odds
of victory, depending on your foes, such as:
• Battlers: Maneuver is your best ploy. You don’t want to give a bat-
tler a fair fight, that’s what it excels at. Try save-or-die spells if a
character in the party has them, because it’ll be easier than wading
through a ton of hit points.
• Ambushers: Assuming your party was ambushed, it’s too late for
maneuver or negotiation. Use your save-or-die spells, or just deal
damage.
• Magic users: Many magic-using monsters tend to be vulnerable in
close combat. Using spells and spell-like abilities is dangerous
when enemies are close by, so get close and reduce their hit points
with melee attacks.
• Special attack users: Most special-attack users tend to be soft in
hit points, but dangerous to get close to. Try dealing damage at
range with damaging spells or archery, or use maneuver to make
the fight safer.
• Multiple threat: Monsters of this sort usually have high saving
throws and are frequently very maneuverable, so avoid save-or-die
spells and complicated maneuver plans. Try to beat multiple
threats through dealing damage or with negotiation.
• No threat: Save the cleric’s and sorcerer’s spells, and take out the
monsters with melee attacks and archery.
224
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

4. Rethink your assumptions: At the end of every round, you should
reassess the battle and figure out if any of your basic assumptions about
the fight have changed. Did the monsters get reinforcements? Have you
found a spot of good terrain that gives your character an advantage?
Were the monsters no real threat at all? Was this a fight you needed, to
run away from? Rethink your assumptions every round to make sure
you’re still fighting the right fight.
Using Advanced Tactics
If all you ever do is pick the right target for your character’s spells, attack effi-
ciently, and consider the occasional tactical retreat, you’re already better off
than a significant number of experienced players. You might have noticed
that the preceding advice is fairly generic. In this section, we talk about a few
specific artifacts of the D&D rules that you can master in order to play your
best game.
Flanking
This is the first and easiest of the advanced tactics you should put to work
for you. If your character and your allies are fighting the same foe, make sure
that someone gets on the monster’s opposite side. Now your character and
your flanking buddy each gain a +2 bonus to melee attacks, and better yet,
every attack your character and your ally make is a potential sneak attack
(assuming that one or the other of your characters is a rogue).
Flanking is described on page 153 of the Player’s Handbook.
Using the Tumble skill is a great way to slip around the monster without getting
mauled by attacks of opportunity (more about those later in this chapter).
Beating the initiative order
The novice player assumes that it’s always better to take his or her turn as
early as possible in the round. We’re working on making you smarter than
that. Sometimes you can manufacture significant tactical advantages by
readying actions or delaying your character’s actions. These two tactics are
known as special initiative actions.
Special initiative actions let you change the initiative order and time your
character’s attacks for maximum effect.
225
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

You find special initiative actions on page 160 of the Player’s Handbook, right
at the end of Chapter 8.
Some specific examples of ways to use the ready and delay actions to your
advantage include:
 Waiting for a flank: Your character is toe-to-toe with the ogre, but your
buddy hasn’t taken his turn yet. Delay your character’s action until your
friend’s character moves up to flank the ogre. When your ally attacks,
he’ll get the flanking bonus because your character is already in position.
Then, your character attacks after your friend goes, and your character
gets the flanking bonus also. If you had just had your character attack on
your turn before your friend’s character was in place on the other side of
the monster, your character wouldn’t have been flanking.
 Waiting for a spell: You’re about to have your character go charging into
melee against a troll, but the cleric has a spell to buff your character for
the fight. You can have your character run off and make an attack right
now without the benefit of the spell — or, you can delay your character’s
action until after the cleric bestows the spell on him or her, and then
make an attack with the help of a comrade’s magic.
 Interrupting enemy actions: Instead of blasting away at your foe on
your turn, ready an action to attack or cast a spell on an enemy as soon
as he does something you don’t like. Instead of putting the damage on
your foe on your turn, you wait until it’s his turn — and the damage your
character does may cause his action to fail.
 Fighting enemies your character can’t reach: If you’re dealing with a
flying monster that swoops in to attack your character and then finishes
its turn well out of reach, ready an action to strike at the monster the
instant it comes within sword-reach. When it attacks, so does your char-
acter, and you don’t spend round after round with your character get-
ting hit and not being able to strike back.
Charging and full attacks
We’ll admit it; if there’s a monster in sight when your turn comes up for the
first time in a fight, it’s awful tempting to have your character run right up
and begin whaling away. But there’s a key mechanic in the game that you
need to keep in mind: If your character moves more than 5 feet, you get only
one attack. If your character stands still or moves 5 feet or less, you can use
the full attack action to strike or shoot multiple times, provided your charac-
ter is fighting with two weapons or has a base attack bonus of +6 or better.
The same rules apply for monsters. Consider this example: You’re facing a
high-level evil fighter, and your turn comes up before his or hers. If you have
your character run up to the fighter, you’ll only make one attack — but when
his or her turn comes up, the evil fighter doesn’t have to move to reach the
226
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

target, because your character is already there. He or she gets to make a full
attack, and possibly attack your character three or four times. If you hadn’t
had your character run up to face the fighter, there’s a good chance he or she
might have chosen to use an action to come up to you. The fighter would be
the one making one attack, and your character would get to unload on him or
her with a full attack on your next turn.
If you’re playing a low-level character, you probably don’t have any way 
to attack more than once per turn in any event. So you might as well move
and attack at the same time, because you don’t get an advantage by making
the monsters and villains come to you.
Charging is a special attack action that enables your character to move up to
twice his or her speed and make an attack at the end of the move. If you need
to reach a foe and attack him fast, charging is a good answer. Your character
also receives a +2 attack bonus when charging — but he or she also suffers a
–2 penalty to Armor Class.
Charging is described on page 154 of the Player’s Handbook. Full attacks are
described in the “Full-Round Actions” section on page 143.
To sum up the key points of charging and full attacks:
 If the enemy is farther away than your character’s speed, but not more
than twice your character’s speed, you can charge and attack. For exam-
ple, if your character’s speed is 20 feet, he or she could charge a foe up
to 40 feet away.
 If the enemy is not farther away than your character’s speed, your char-
acter can move and attack (or your character can charge in order to gain
the attack bonus, as long as he or she is at least 10 feet away). If your
character’s speed is 20 feet, your character can move up to 20 feet and
charge or attack the enemy.
 If the enemy is next to your character or only 5 feet away, your character
can stand still or take a 5-foot step and make a full attack, striking with
all weapons or gaining multiple attacks with a single weapon if his or her
base attack bonus is +6 or better.
Avoiding attacks of opportunity
Attacks of opportunity are free, instant attacks anyone gets when someone
who’s threatened (close enough to get hit with a melee weapon) undertakes 
a complicated or risky action. Things that provoke attacks of opportunity
include casting spells, trying to start a grapple, ignoring a foe in order to move
through multiple squares he or she threatens, and a whole host of other
things.
227
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

You can read all about attacks of opportunity on page 137 of the Player’s
Handbook.
Basically, you don’t want to provoke attacks of opportunity. It’s not smart to
give the monsters free extra attacks against your character, because some-
times those attacks will hit, and your character will wind up taking more
damage than necessary. Worse yet, maybe the monster will get really lucky,
roll a critical hit, and take your character out of the fight with one swing —
when it’s not even the monster’s turn.
That said, sometimes players go to extreme lengths to avoid insignificant
attacks of opportunity. If you’re playing a cleric with an AC of 22 who’s fight-
ing a goblin warrior with an attack bonus of +2, the goblin’s only going to hit
your cleric on a roll of 20. Ninety-five percent of the time, you can safely dis-
regard the threat the goblin poses and ignore him or her. Be conservative in
deciding when a foe can be ignored, though.
You’ve got four good ways to have your character maneuver around mon-
sters and foes without giving them attacks of opportunity:
 5-foot step: You can limit your character’s movement to a 5-foot step. If
your character only takes a 5-foot step, he or she doesn’t provoke
attacks of opportunity just for moving through an enemy’s threatened
squares. You can also just have your character step back from a foe in
order to get room to cast a spell or use a magic item safely.
 Tumble: The Tumble skill lets your character move safely through
squares threatened by a foe. It’s a great way to make risky moves that
otherwise might get your character pounded by your enemies.
 Using up the monster’s attacks: The vast majority of monsters and char-
acters can only make one attack of opportunity per round (the excep-
tions are those creatures and characters who have the Combat Reflexes
feat). After an ally has provoked the creature’s attack of opportunity,
your character is safe to ignore it — until the monster’s turn comes up
again, and its capability for attacks of opportunity resets. You might try
callously throwing away a weak ally in order to draw off the foe’s attacks
of opportunity. For example, if you use a summon monster spell to con-
jure a fiendish wolf, you might be able to direct that wolf to do things
that deliberately provoke attacks of opportunity. You don’t care if the
wolf gets killed because it’s only a summoned monster. But it might be
very useful to you for your minion to draw an opponent into using up
his or her attacks of opportunity.
 Withdraw: If you need to get away from an enemy without that enemy
getting a “parting shot,” use the withdraw action (see page 143 of the
Player’s Handbook). Your character won’t be able to do anything else
this turn, but at least he or she won’t get killed just for leaving.
228
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Fighting defensively
Sometimes your best move is to play for time. Most players believe that the
best defense is a good offense; if you want to avoid getting hit, take down the
monster so fast it doesn’t get many chances to hurt you.
Consider this scenario: You’re playing a cleric with few combat spells left,
fighting alongside a raging barbarian friend who’s got his Strength cranked up
to 25 and is cutting hill giants in half with every swing of his greataxe. Your
cleric’s mace attack just isn’t going to make that much difference in taking
down the monsters, but there are significant advantages to staying in the
melee. First of all, your cleric will draw some number of attacks away from
the barbarian; when he’s raging, his Armor Class might be a 16 or 17, while
your cleric’s is well above 20. Second, your cleric is close to the barbarian so
that your cleric can heal him up quickly if necessary. Finally, your cleric can
maneuver to give your raging barbarian buddy a flanking bonus and improve
his attack capability even more.
In a situation like this, you might try fighting defensively. You take a penalty on
your attack rolls to improve your character’s AC and reduce his or her chances
of getting hit. Fighting defensively also works well when you’re dealing with an
enemy that your character can hit pretty much automatically (giving up some
attack bonus in that case costs you nothing). And, if your character is fighting
someone that he or she can only hit if you roll a 20, well, you might as well give
your character the best AC possible while you wait for a lucky roll.
Here are some good ways to fight defensively:
 Fight defensively: Take a –4 penalty on your attack rolls, and get a +2
dodge bonus to your character’s AC for the round.
 Go totally defense: If you don’t want your character to make even a
token swing at the monster, use the total defense option. You have to
use a standard action, so you can’t have your character attack or cast a
spell in the same round that you use total defense, but you gain a +4
dodge bonus to your character’s Armor Class.
 Use the Combat Expertise feat: The Combat Expertise feat allows you to
fine-tune your attack rolls and your character’s Armor Class by voluntar-
ily taking a penalty of –1 to –5 to improve AC with a dodge bonus equal
to the penalty you took. So you could take a –2 attack penalty to get +2
dodge bonus to AC. You’ll find the full description of this feat on page 92
of the Player’s Handbook.
 Take advantage of cover: Try to put something big and solid between
your character and the monster. Cover generally offers your character a
+4 bonus to Armor Class. You may or may not suffer a penalty to attack
the monster, depending on where your character is in relation to the
monster and the object that’s providing cover. Cover is described in
detail on page 150 of the Player’s Handbook.
229
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

Most of these special combat rules can be found in Chapter 8 of the Player’s
Handbook. Fighting defensively is described on page 140. Total defense is
described on page 142, and cover is described at length on page 150. Finally,
you’ll find the rules for the Combat Expertise feat on page 92.
Maximizing Your Character’s Attacks
Your single most precious commodity in the game is the number of turns you
get in the course of the day. The typical D&D battle lasts about five rounds,
and you can expect your character to be in about four battles per day of
adventuring — so your character only has 20 turns per day to beat down bad
guys and make a difference in the adventure. Getting the most out of every
turn you take is absolutely vital.
Setting up attacks of opportunity
If actions are your most valuable asset, then any tactic that lets your charac-
ter get more opportunities to damage the enemy without costing any actions
is worth a closer look. Attacks of opportunity offer your character the chance
to make extra attacks when it isn’t even your turn; if you can manufacture
even one attack of opportunity per five rounds of combat, you’re cramming
six rounds of actions into five rounds of fighting. You’ll be 20 percent more
effective than the player who didn’t position his or her character to take
advantage of the opening when it came up.
Manufacturing lots of attacks of opportunity requires three things: A weapon
with reach, the Combat Reflexes feat, and some tactical acumen. In the first
two cases, you need to deliberately design your character to get lots of
attacks of opportunity. But, as for the last, all you have to do is play a little
smart.
Character building for the bloodthirsty
If you like your character to make lots of attacks, here are some character
design tips you can try out:
 Carry a reach weapon: Choose a weapon with reach as your character’s
primary weapon. A reach weapon lets your character threaten far more
of the battlefield than a weapon that he or she can only use against
someone adjacent to him or her. The best choices are the longspear
(simple), glaive (martial), or spiked chain (exotic). Longspears and
glaives have a big drawback — they can only attack with reach, so your
character can’t use one to attack someone standing right next to him or
her. The spiked chain doesn’t have that disadvantage, but it takes an
Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat to master the spiked chain.
230
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

 Take the Combat Reflexes feat: Buy the Combat Reflexes feat as early in
your character’s career as possible. Be warned: Unless your character
has a Dexterity score of 13 or better, you don’t get much benefit from
taking this feat. But a spiked chain wielder with Combat Reflexes and a
Dex of 14 or better can cover a lot of ground and make up to three
attacks of opportunity each round.
Tactics that go for the throat
In addition to some clever character design, you can also use some hard-
nosed tactical play to put your character in a position to gather up every
attack of opportunity that might come his or her way:
 Controlling territory: Put your character in a spot where the enemy has
to go past your character to get at other party members (or to get away
from other party members). Look for tactical chokepoints in the fight
where your character can block a hallway or a door and get a free hack
on anyone trying to go through.
 Menacing everyone: Move your character up to put as many foes as
possible within reach of his or her weapon, especially if they are spell-
casters (or monsters who use spell-like abilities, which also provoke
attacks of opportunity). This strategy is a little risky, because it’s some-
times not a great idea to go get your character surrounded, but the more
enemies within reach of your character’s weapon, the more likely it is
that one of them will do something stupid and give you a free shot.
 Tripping the light fantastic: Use trip attacks or spells that knock people
down in order to knock your foes prone. Standing up provokes an attack
of opportunity — and crawling away provokes one too. The best combo
for tripping is the spiked chain in conjunction with the Improved Trip
feat, but there are other ways to manufacture trip attacks. Dogs, wolves,
and wolf-like monsters usually have a trip ability, so choose something
canine for your character’s animal companion if you’re playing a ranger
or druid, or make a point of summoning such creatures with summon
monster spells if you’re playing a spellcaster.
Hitting hard: Power Attack 101
One of the best ways to maximize your character’s attacks is to get the
Power Attack feat and use it cleverly. First of all, the Cleave feat is part of 
the Power Attack feat tree (see Chapter 14 for more about feat trees), so
buying Power Attack puts you on the road to a feat that generates extra
attacks for your character — and, as we already noted earlier in this chapter,
extra attacks are all good. But, even more than that, Power Attack allows
you to convert “overkill” attack bonus into a big-time damage bonus. The
trick lies in determining how much you can safely take off your character’s
attack bonus and still have a good chance of hitting the target.
231
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

In any given situation, you want the best expected damage value you can get.
Your expected damage value is equal to your character’s chance of hitting
times your average damage roll. For example, say that your character has an
attack bonus of +8 and he or she deals 1d10+4 points of damage on a success-
ful hit. Against a target with an AC of 17, your character hits on a roll of 9 or
better (a 60 percent chance to hit) and deals an average of 9.5 points of
damage (the average value of a d10 roll is 5.5). The expected damage for that
attack is 5.7 points. Your character’s average hit deals more than that, of
course, but you have to factor in the 40 percent of attacks in which your
character swings and misses.
Now, say that you use 3 points of Power Attack. Your character’s attack
bonus drops to +5, but your average damage increases to 1d10+7. Against
this same AC 17 foe, your character hits on a 12 or better (45 percent chance)
and deals an average of 12.5 points of damage. The expected damage value is
12.5 × 0.45, or 5.625 points. Your Power Attack didn’t help you at all.
But . . . if your character uses a two-handed weapon, the Power Attack feat
gives you twice the damage bonus. Taking a –3 on your attack roll gives you a
+6 on damage. So now your average damage increases from 1d10+4 to
1d10+10 (15.5 points). Your expected damage value is 15.5 × 0.45, or 6.975
points. Even though your character will miss more often, the extra damage
makes using the Power Attack feat worth it against this AC 17 enemy.
Most experienced players with a character built for Power Attack do all this
math ahead of time, so that they can make an educated guess at the oppo-
nent’s AC and quickly determine if they want to Power Attack, and how much
they want to Power Attack for. Here’s a quick primer on “easy” Power Attack
situations:
 Charging: You get a +2 attack bonus, so you can roll this into Power
Attack and get a damage boost without changing your normal attack
bonus.
 Flanking: Ditto. You get a +2 attack bonus when your character is flank-
ing, so you can roll it straight into Power Attack.
 Smiting: When a paladin or cleric of the Destruction domain makes a
smite attack, he or she gets an attack bonus. Roll this into Power Attack.
 Very soft targets: If your opponent has a crummy AC, you can Power
Attack for a lot and still hit him.
 Very hard targets: If you can only hit on a 20, you might as well Power
Attack for all you’re worth.

Adapting Your Tactics to Your Foes
The earlier sections of this chapter give you the medieval equivalent of a Ph.D.
in Hurt — in the rest of the chapter, we show you some specific tactical situa-
tions that come up all the time in game play. It’s rare that you participate in an
adventure that doesn’t feature at least one or more of the following scenarios.
Beating spellcasters
Enemy spellcasters are dangerous because they can either put damage on a
number of party members at once with a spell such as fireball or take out one
of your comrades per turn with an all-or-nothing spell such as a hold person
or disintegrate. However, the most dangerous spellcasters (sorcerers and wiz-
ards) tend to be soft targets (enemies with low Armor Class and poor hit
points). Hit them fast and hard.
Here are three nasty tricks you can try the next time your party comes across
an evil wizard:
 Suppressive fire: If you’re having your character use a ranged attack (a
bow or spells of his or her own), don’t attack when your turn comes up.
Instead, ready an action to take a shot (or cast a spell) on the enemy
spellcaster’s turn, as soon as he or she begins to cast a spell. If your
character lays some damage on the enemy wizard when he or she is
casting a spell, the wizard will have to make a Concentration check to
complete the spell. If your character had just shot him or her on your
turn, the wizard wouldn’t have to do that. Your character will end up
dealing the same damage to the enemy that he or she was going to deal
the wizard by shooting on your turn, and you’ll also give the wizard a
chance to muff his or her spell.
 Box and menace: The classic response to an enemy wizard is to put an
angry fighter in his or her face. Charge or run past any obstacles in the
way to reach the wizard. If he or she casts a spell while threatened by your
character, he or she will have to either cast defensively or step away from
your character in order to cast safely. If you can get an ally on the other
side of the enemy wizard, you can box him or her so that he or she can’t
move or cast a spell without giving your character an attack of opportu-
nity. The downside of this tactic is that many enemy spellcasters have
great Concentration skill modifiers, allowing them to cast defensively with
a fair amount of confidence.
 Grapple: This is our favorite, because for some reason DMs just don’t
think it can happen to their master villains. Run up to the enemy wizard
and start a grapple. Wizards are usually very poor grapplers and often
don’t even bother to keep a weapon in hand to foil your character’s grap-
ple attempt. The best part is that spellcasting in a grapple is virtually
impossible.
233
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

Handling numerous foes
The good news about being outnumbered is that you’re probably dealing
with foes who are individually weaker than your character. D&D is heroic fic-
tion, and in heroic fiction, you can mop the floor with whole gangs of numer-
ous bad guys who can’t hit the broadside of a barn. If you find your character
outnumbered by foes who are as tough (or tougher) than your character,
then run! Your character is going to get creamed.
The following list offers some helpful tactics to try when your character is
outnumbered and surrounded by enemies:
 Concentrate the damage: Don’t have your character hit one orc in one
round, and then attack a different orc in next round. In D&D, enemies
don’t lose any offensive potential until they drop dead, so slowly wear-
ing down multiple foes at once simply means that you’re giving more
enemies opportunities to hurt your character before they go down. Pick
on one or two foes at a time and drop them before starting on the next
enemies.
 Control the battlefield: Look for ways to divide and conquer foes. Have
your character retreat into a narrow passage where enemies can only
come at him or her a couple at a time. Use terrain-altering spells such as
grease or wall of ice to isolate some of your enemies from their pals. If
nothing else presents itself, just move. When your character is standing
still on open ground, you’re making it easy for your foes to surround
your character and attack from all sides. If you keep your character
moving, you won’t find your character in the middle of three or four bad
guys all taking full attacks on him or her every round.
Fighting monsters your 
character can’t hurt
Lots of monsters have defenses that are very difficult to overcome, but usually
someone in the party has a weapon that works. The sorcerer’s magic missiles
hurt almost anything, if all else fails.
The basic strategy for fighting a monster most of the party can’t hurt is to
protect and support whichever characters can hurt the monster. Everybody
else simply buys time for the effective character or characters to wear down
the foe, and does their best to make sure the character doing the hard work
stays healed up and in the thick of the fight.
234
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

High-AC foes
Enemies with superior Armor Class may be virtually impossible for your
character to hit with melee or ranged attacks. Fortunately, your character
can hit anything if you roll a natural 20 on your attack roll, so if nothing else,
you can simply have your character flail away at the enemy until you get a
lucky roll. Here are some different ideas:
 Tackle the monster: Grapple your enemy. Grapple attacks ignore Armor
Class, and if your character can wrestle the creature to the ground, you
can gain control of the situation. But don’t try to grapple really big mon-
sters: Large monsters have high Strength scores, as well as an inherent
bonus to grapple checks that your character will have a hard time beat-
ing. Check out the “Grapple” section, which starts on page 155 of the
Player’s Handbook.
 Flank and aid another: If your foe is nothing you want your character to
wrestle with, surround it to get the +2 attack bonus for flanking . . . then
have as many characters as possible use the aid another action in order
to provide the character with the best chance of hitting extra attack
bonuses.
 Maximize one character: Have your party’s buffing spellcasters power
up the most effective character with spells such as bless, enlarge person,
or a bard’s song, whatever it takes. You can usually manufacture a boost
of at least +4 to +6 or more on one character’s attack rolls.
High-DR foes
DR, or damage resistance, can be very hard to fight through. When the iron
golem is ignoring the first 15 points from every hit each of the player charac-
ters hands it, the party is not going to wear it down very fast at all. Assuming
that you can’t solve the problem by having your character cast a spell such
as align weapon or switching to a secondary weapon such as a silver dagger
stuck in a boot, you’re in for a hard fight.
The following tactics work well against monsters with a high damage resistance:
 Power Attack: It’s ugly, but it works. If your character has the Power
Attack feat, take a big penalty on your attack roll in order to crank up
the damage your character deals with each hit. If your character is
wielding a two-handed weapon, you can take a –5 attack penalty in order
to deal +10 damage . . . which is certainly enough to make a dent in even
the best DR. Because you’re giving up your character’s chance of scor-
ing a hit, you should then use some of the tactics described in the “High-
AC foes” section, earlier in this chapter, in order to restore as much of
your attack roll as you can.
235
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

 Sneak attack: The rogue’s sneak attack is also useful for getting through
DR, because a good sneak attack (say, +4d6 or +5d6) can turn a 5-point
hit into a 20- or 25-point hit. Once again, you’ll want to do everything in
your power to make sure the rogue makes a lot of sneak attacks with the
most help you can provide him or her.
Watch out for monsters that have a good DR and are also immune to sneak
attacks, such as golems or undead. This tactic won’t work on them.
 Magic: Make the sorcerer work for a living. Almost all spells ignore
damage reduction. Let your party’s spellcasters beat the monster with
damaging spells or save-or-die spells.
Elusive foes
Some enemies are hard to hurt because they’re simply not there for your
character’s attacks. Good examples are incorporeal creatures such as
specters or shadows that can attack through the walls, or evil monks who
use high movement rates and Spring Attacks to whack your character and
then bound away before your character can reply.
Try the following strategies when your character is facing an elusive foe:
 Ready an attack: Ready an action to whale on your adversary whenever
he or she comes within reach. Even if your foe’s movements and attacks
don’t normally provoke attacks of opportunity, a readied attack isn’t an
attack of opportunity; your character can get a swing at the enemy when
he or she moves in to attack. It works better than standing around wait-
ing to get hit.
 Get the right help: Cast summon monster or summon nature’s ally to
bring in an ally better suited for fighting the foe than your character. For
example, most animals have the Scent ability; they’re much better at
attacking invisible foes than your character is. A fiendish dire wolf does
wonders to keep invisible enemies honest.

 Fine-tuning your character’s spell selection
 Planning spells for success
 Smart spellcasting
 Maxing out your character’s magic items
A
lthough every adventuring party needs a fighter or two to stand up and
dish out the physical damage to the monsters, the majority of combat
encounters in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are decided by the use of magic.
A fireball drops the evil wizard’s orc bodyguards; an improved invisibility spell
on the party’s rogue lets him or her launch a dizzying barrage of lethal sneak
attacks; the attacking mummies are simply incinerated by the cleric’s flame
strike spell. The D&D experience has been summed up as simply as “the game
where you fight monsters with magic,” and that says it all.
In this chapter, we tell you about the fine arts of picking the right spell for the
right job, casting effective spells in battle, and maximizing any character’s
power with the acquisition of the right magic items. We also show you some
baseline magic item purchases to quickly equip higher-level characters.
Selecting Spells for the Adventure
Beyond the basic division of arcane and divine spellcasters, there’s another
important categorization for characters who wield magic: spontaneous casters
and prepared casters.
Bards and sorcerers are spontaneous casters. Any spell that they know, they
can use at any time, so long as they still have spell slots left. Spontaneous cast-
ers generally don’t know very many spells; finding versatile spells or spells
with more than one application is a big part of being a successful spontaneous
caster. Bards and sorcerers can only add to the spells they know when they
gain a character level; they can’t adjust their magic capabilities to the specific
mission at hand.

On the other hand, clerics, druids, and wizards (and paladins and rangers
too, for that matter, although they don’t really cast enough spells to matter)
must prepare their spells. They can choose from much broader spell lists
than the bard and sorcerer, but once they fix their spell choices in place, they
generally can’t alter those choices on the fly. The good news is that their
spell lists can change drastically from day to day, allowing you to focus your
character’s spell selection for very specific missions.
The differences between each spellcasting character class’s ability to prepare
or spontaneously cast some or all of their spells give you some basic guide-
lines to choosing your character’s spells, as follows:
 Bard: As a spontaneous caster, you can’t adjust your bard’s spell selec-
tion for the adventure. When your character gains new spells at each
experience level, select spells that provide versatility, such as silent
image, summon monster, and charm person or charm monster.
 Cleric: The cleric’s ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into
healing spells means that you should not include a cure spell of any sort
in your cleric’s prepared spells. Instead, prepare offensive spells such as
spiritual hammer or searing light. You can convert them to cure spells at a
moment’s notice. Also, don’t forget to prepare one domain spell per
spell level.
 Druid: The druid’s ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells 
into summon nature’s ally spells means that you should never assign any
summon nature’s ally spells to your druid’s available spell slots. Instead,
prepare various cure spells and other defensive spells; you can switch
them to offense at a moment’s notice by turning them into summon
nature’s ally spells. 
 Sorcerer: The sorcerer doesn’t have the ability to adjust spell selection
in mid-adventure, because he or she is a spontaneous caster. If you’re
playing a sorcerer, you want your sorcerer’s known spell list to include
spells that can be used in a number of different ways. Such spells include
illusion spells, summon monster spells, and transmutation spells such as
alter self or polymorph. If your character knows a few of these spells, you
can quickly generate offense, defense, or utility as you need it.
 Wizard: The wizard has the greatest flexibility of all the spellcasting
classes. If you’re playing a wizard, you can reinvent your wizard as an
entirely new character every time you decide which spells you want
your character to prepare. In general, you should prepare about 40 to 60
percent of your wizard’s available spell slots as attack spells of some
kind, but that depends on what you’re up against in the game. Check out
the spell selection process described in the following steps for more
specific guidance.
238
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Here’s an easy process to follow when you’re considered which spells you
want your character to prepare for the day’s adventuring:
1. Consider the scenario: What are you trying to do? Is the party going
monster-hunting? Select spells to find and kill monsters. Is the party
going to explore a trap-filled tomb? Take spells that will let the party
get around or through traps. Is the party trying to infiltrate an evil
thieves’ guild? Take spells of disguise, enchantment, and subterfuge.
2. Review what you know: What do you know about the obstacles you
expect to meet in the adventure? If the party has learned that the evil
warlord’s castle is guarded by ogre berserkers, you can expect to run 
into lots of ogres. Chances are good that charm person or dominate
person spells won’t help much, because ogres are giants, not humanoids.
If you discover you don’t have any information at all, perhaps you should
make gaining information your mission for the day (see Reconnaissance,
below), and then go in with guns blazing tomorrow, after you know a little
bit more.
3. Choose your mission: How do you want to accomplish your goals in the
current adventure? Do you expect to have your character directly attack-
ing the foes with magic? Will you have your character use magic to help
friends move through difficult terrain or around dangerous enemies? Or
do you want your character to be ready to support friends with buffing
and healing spells? Here are some of your choices:
• Direct attack: Your character’s role for the day is to provide magi-
cal firepower for the party of adventurers. Prepare offensive spells
such as magic missile, sleep, web, fireball, confusion, or hold mon-
ster. If you’re playing a cleric, consider the combat monster or
battle caster cleric spell loadouts described in Chapter 17.
• Maneuver: Your character is going to help the party get to where
it can do the most good. Fly, water breathing, teleport, and resist
energy are typical spells that allow the party to go somewhere
they otherwise couldn’t go. Prepare however many spells of the
right sort that you’ll need to make your plan work.
• Reconnaissance: Your character is going to gather information 
pertaining to the mission. Spells such as charm person, invisibility,
clairaudience/clairvoyance, scrying, or even summon monster may
be useful in allowing your character to efficiently question captured
foes, slip into places he or she is not supposed to be, or scout out
dangerous locales before the party walks into a deadly ambush.
• Support: Your character is going to help the party stand up to
damage and fight better. Prepare spells that buff comrades and
generally contribute versatility and extra options. Mage armor,
invisibility, dispel magic, polymorph, stoneskin, and teleport are
all good options for this kind of role. If you’re playing a cleric, 
consider the master healer cleric spell loadout.
239
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

4. Leave a slot open? If you’re playing a wizard, you don’t have to fill all
your character’s spell slots with prepared spells. You can choose to
leave some slots “empty,” ready to be filled with just 15 minutes of 
study time (see “Spell Preparation Time” on page 178 of the Player’s
Handbook). 
Leaving a few spell slots open is an extremely powerful tool for a wizard. The
wizard is the only spellcaster who has the ability to examine an obstacle or
opponent and then study a spellbook to find the exact right spell to deal with
it. If you don’t know what your character is going to meet in the adventure,
and you’ve got a lot of spell slots to fill, consider leaving a handful of slots
empty. Don’t leave too many slots empty, though — you might need those
spells in a fight!
Casting Effectively in Combat
You can have your character use spells to secure all the advantages you like
before entering the dungeon, but sooner or later, your character is going to
have to fight the monsters. If you’re playing a sorcerer or a wizard, your char-
acter has no weapon worth speaking of other than magic. Bards, clerics, and
druids have more options in a fight, but by the time a cleric is 7th or 8th
level, he should be spending most of his actions in a battle casting spells to
aid his allies and hinder his foes. A high-level cleric might as well leave his
mace at home, because he never gets a chance to swing it.
As a spellcaster, your character should stay away from sword fights. The last
place you want your character to be is right in front of the monsters or vil-
lains, where they can pound on your character with their melee attacks.
Unfortunately, this decision is not always up to you. Sometimes spellcasters
get caught off-guard or trapped in tight quarters, and the monsters are in
their faces before they can get out of the way.
Getting caught in a melee is bad for two reasons. First of all, your character is
exposed to the enemies’ best and most dangerous attacks. No sane sorcerer
wants to be anywhere near an angry ogre with a big spiked club. Second, the
great majority of spells your character casts in melee provoke attacks of oppor-
tunity (see Chapter 19 of this book for more info). Even if your character sur-
vives the free attack he or she just gave the bad guy, each hit your character
takes while casting a spell forces him or her to make a Concentration skill
check or lose the spell outright. So, not only is your character exposed to
direct attack, you’re putting your character in a situation where he or she
might not be able to safely use the best weapon at his or her disposal: spells.
240
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Fortunately, there are a few ways to slither out of this difficult position:
 5-foot step: Your character can step one square away from the foe
threatening him or her without provoking an attack of opportunity for
moving. If you then find that your character is no longer threatened, he
or she can then safely cast spells. Be careful about trying this on large
opponents such as ogres or giants, though — your character might back
off one square but still be within the area these monsters threaten due
to their great melee reach.
 Cast defensively: Your character can attempt to cast a spell defensively
with a successful Concentration check. The DC of the check is 15 + spell
level. For instance, if you want your character to cast lightning bolt, all
he or she has to do is pass a DC 18 Concentration check. If your charac-
ter has a lot of ranks in the Concentration skill (or has the Combat
Casting feat), it’s pretty easy to make this check.
 Find cover: If you can get some kind of cover in between your character
and the monster threatening him or her, you prevent the monster from
making an attack of opportunity on your character. Even hiding behind
an ally works. If your character can’t take a 5-foot step away from the
monster, see if you can find a square nearby where your character will
have something (a wall, another character, a big rock, almost anything)
in between him or her and the antagonist.
 Use a wand: A number of magic items replicate the effects of various
spells but don’t provoke attacks of opportunity. Staffs and wands are
two of the most common. If you find your character in a situation where
casting a spell will draw an attack of opportunity, you can fall back to
using a wand or other magic item to cast a spell instead.
Powering Up with Magic Items
The spells your character commands represent only a portion of the magical
power available to the typical adventuring party. The other half of the equation
is the party’s collection of magic items. For example, the fighter carries a magic
sword and wears magic armor; the rogue has a ring of invisibility; the wizard
has a wand of lightning bolt; and the cleric wears a helm of brilliance. Spells are
just for spellcasters, but any character can carry a powerful magic item.
When you create a 1st-level character, that character begins with low-grade,
nonmagical gear and a handful of pocket change. But as your character has
successful adventures, he or she recovers staggering amounts of wealth and
magic items of great and terrible power. Your character’s collection of magic
items is just as much a part of him or her as the choice of class, skills, and
241
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

feats. A fighter who owns winged boots is a very different character from a
fighter who owns a scarab of protection. 
Types of magic items
Magic items come in a variety of different forms, ranging from mighty magic
swords, to life-saving potions, to artifacts of godlike power. By the time your
character gets a few experience levels under his or her belt, you’ll probably
have a good array of magic items to choose from.
Here’s a quick tour of the types of magic items you’re likely to find or purchase:
 Armor: Magic armor (and magic shields) work much like normal armor,
except better. Magic armor has an enhancement bonus (or a “plus”)
associated with it, so you might find a suit of +2 scale mail or a +4 heavy
steel shield. The value of the bonus is added to the AC bonus provided
by the armor. So, for example, normal scale mail gives a +4 armor bonus
to AC, but +2 scale mail adds 6 points to AC. 
 Weapons: Magic weapons work a lot like magic armor; they’ve got an
enhancement bonus (a “plus”) that you add to each attack and damage
roll your character makes with the weapon. For example, a 4th-level
fighter with a Strength of 16 and a longsword has an attack bonus of +7
(+4 for the character’s fighter levels and +3 Strength modifier) and deals
1d8+3 points of damage. If the same character fights with a +2 longsword,
the attack bonus becomes +9, and the fighter deals 1d8+5 points of
damage per hit.
 Potion: A potion is a one-use spell your character drinks. When your
character drinks it, the potion’s magic takes effect for a short time, and
the potion is used up. Almost any low-level spell can be found in the
form of a potion, but some of the most common are potions of cure light
wounds, bull’s strength, invisibility, and fly.
 Scroll: A scroll is a one-use spell that a trained spellcaster can read. It lets
your character cast the spell on the scroll without using up any of his or
her own spell slots for the day. Potions work for anybody, but only a char-
acter of the right class (sorcerer or wizard for a scroll with a sorcerer/
wizard spell, cleric for a cleric spell scroll, and so on) can use a scroll.
(However, if your character has some ranks in the Use Magic Device skill,
a successful skill check enables your character to break that rule.)
 Ring: Well, we all know about magic rings now, don’t we? Don’t worry,
not every ring is The One Ring to Rule Them All. Magical rings range
from minor protective devices such as a +1 ring of protection (which
adds a +1 deflection bonus to AC) to powerful items such as the ring
of wizardry (which doubles your character’s spell slots at a particular
242
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

spell level). Some rings have charges that eventually run out, but others
provide benefits that last as long as a character wears the ring.
 Wand: A wand simply holds a single spell with 50 uses. So a wand of
magic missiles holds the magic missile spell, and your character can use
it 50 times before the wand is burned out. Like a scroll, a wand can only
be used by a character of the right spellcasting class. Wands are set at a
certain caster level when they’re created, and you can’t change that. So,
even if you’re playing a 10th-level wizard, a wand of magic missiles
(caster level 1st) only produces a single missile each time it’s used.
Once your character spends that last charge, he or she might as well
throw away the wand — it’s nothing but a stick now.
 Staff: A staff is like a wand, except that it usually holds several different
spells. Your character can use the staff’s charges to cast any spell the
staff holds. A staff also allows you to use your character’s own caster
level to cast those spells, if your character’s caster level is higher than
the staff’s caster level. If you’re playing a high-level spellcaster, this is a
significant advantage.
 Rod: Rods are weird. They’re devices that incorporate strange powers
that aren’t easily replicated by existing spells. Many rods also serve as
weapons, too — for example, the rod of thunder and lightning serves as a
+2 light mace, if your character just wants to beat somebody with it.
243
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

 Wondrous item: Most other magic items are lumped together in the
wondrous items category. Wondrous items range from magical articles
of attire, such as a hat of disguise, boots of speed, belt of giant’s strength,
or cloak of resistance, to useful devices such as a flying carpet or crystal
ball. We just can’t offer much in the way of generalizations about won-
drous items, because they’re all diverse and unique. But here are four
basic types of wondrous items that are exceptionally common:
• Ability adders: Many wondrous items increase your character’s
ability scores. For example, gauntlets of ogre power gives a charac-
ter a +2 enhancement bonus to his or her Strength score as long as
the character is wearing them — any fighter would love to have a
pair of these. Other ability adders include the belt of giant strength,
gloves of Dexterity, headband of intellect, periapt of Wisdom, amulet
of health, and cloak of Charisma.
• AC adders: Characters who can’t wear armor turn to magic items
to improve their Armor Class. Bracers of armor add an armor
bonus ranging from +1 to +9, depending on how good they are. The
amulet of natural armor adds a natural armor bonus ranging from
+1 to +5.
• Save adders: Several items add a bonus to one or more of your
character’s saving throws. The most common is the cloak of resis-
tance, which adds a +1 to +5 resistance bonus to all your charac-
ter’s saves.
• Spell users: Finally, a variety of items give your character the ability
to use one or more spells. These may be disposable items (a neck-
lace of fireballs may hold as few as three fireballs) or items that give
your character the ability to use the spell a limited number of times
per day (the circlet of blasting lets your character use the spell sear-
ing light once per day).
Acquiring magic items
Magic items sound great, don’t they? You might think that every character
should have some, and in the vast majority of D&D games, they do. But here’s
the downside: Your character’s acquisition of magic items is entirely in the
hands of your Dungeon Master. If your DM doesn’t include magic items in the
treasure stashes of the monsters the party defeats, well, your character won’t
find many. And if your DM decides that magic items just aren’t bought and
sold in his or her campaign, you won’t be able to turn big piles of gold into a
wand of lightning bolt and a flaming sword. You’ve got to live with what your
DM lets your character have.
244
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Finding items
Monsters often guard hoards of staggering wealth, including long-lost devices
with mighty enchantments. Champions of evil are usually armed and armored
with powerful magic items, which are there for the taking after the party has
defeated the previous owner. In fact, a knowledgeable player often goes out
of his or her way to battle against villains such as dark knights and evil wiz-
ards, because these NPCs (nonplayer characters) are great sources of magic
items your character can “turn to the service of good” (which sounds better
than “loot from their bloody corpses,” but a rose by any other name . . .).
The best way to quickly determine if there’s some interesting booty at hand
is to cast the detect magic spell. Most 0-level spells are pretty worthless, so
you might as well fill up those slots with detect magic spells. Or, if you don’t
mind making a minor investment in looting technology, buy a wand of detect
magic. It’s only 375 gp, and your character can use it 50 times before it runs
out of charges.
The difficulty with items your character finds in monster hoards or on the 
persons of defeated villains is that they don’t often come with name tags and
instruction manuals. Many DMs don’t waste much time on making you guess
what magic items your character is carrying, because nothing is more annoying
than listening to a player constantly say things like, “Okay, I rolled an 18 for my
attack roll . . . plus whatever the bonus on this sword is, so maybe it’s a 19 or a
20. So did I hit or what?” But some DMs are sticklers for this, so be prepared.
The surest way to figure out what item your character has is to cast an iden-
tify spell (or arrange to have such a spell cast, if no one in your party of
adventurers can do it). Identify isn’t cheap; it costs 100 gp each time you cast
it, because the spell requires a pearl worth 100 gp. Save identify spells for
things you really can’t figure out otherwise. 
Clever guessing with detect magic
All magic items possess a magical aura, which can be detected by means of 
a detect magic spell. The detect magic spell can often provide some dead-
giveaway clues as to an item’s use or function, because the spell tells you
how strongly the item in question is enchanted. You’re also allowed to make
a Spellcraft check to determine the school of magic of the item. (The schools
of magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illu-
sion, necromancy, and transmutation.) Different types of items make use of
different magic schools. Here are some quick tips on using detect magic to
make a quick and accurate assessment of a magic item:
 Armor and weapons: If the aura is faint, you’re looking at a weapon or
armor with a +1 magical enhancement. If it’s moderate evocation, the
item probably has a +2 or +3 enhancement.
245
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

 Potions: If the aura is conjuration, it’s probably a cure light wounds or
cure moderate wounds potion. There are other potions based on conjura-
tion spells, but cure light wounds potions are by far the most common.
 Bracers: If the aura is moderate conjuration, they’re bracers of armor.
 Cloaks: A cloak with a faint abjuration aura is probably a cloak of 
resistance. 
Buying and selling items
The other way to acquire magic items is to simply buy them. If your charac-
ter loots a dragon’s hoard and finds 20,000 pieces of gold, you’ve got 20 grand
to spend. In D&D, the point of gaining wealth is so that you can spend it on
the biggest, most impressive magic items you can find for your character, and
then go get even more treasure so you can buy even better magic items.
Buying magic items works in both directions, of course. When your character
finds a +3 flaming adamantine longsword, that old +2 longsword doesn’t look
so useful anymore. You can sell items, too — but you usually only get 50 per-
cent of the purchase price. Your character may acquire a dozen +1 rapiers
when the party raids the drow outpost; the best thing to do is to keep one
and sell the rest, so that your character can turn some of that loot into magic
items that are more useful to him or her.
In general, your character needs to find a good-sized city in order to buy or
sell an expensive magic item. The reasoning is that no one in a flea-speck-
sized village way off in the middle of nowhere has a +3 sword to sell. The
bigger the town, the better the odds of finding good magic items to buy.
A word of advice: A lot of DMs are old school on the topic of buying magic
items. In earlier editions of the D&D game, magic items just weren’t bought;
your character could only find or steal them. Ask your DM how he or she
wants to handle this in the game.
Defining the magic item baseline
Heads up! The D&D game assumes that your character has a selection of
magic items appropriate to his or her class and level. The Challenge Rating 
of monsters is based on this assumption. You may think it’s absolutely snazzy
for your 10th-level fighter to walk around with a carpet of flying, but if your
fighter doesn’t have a magic weapon by 10th level, you’re going to find that
it’s hard to hold up your end in a fight.
In this section, we show you a typical path for collecting magic items for each
of the four base classes (fighter, rogue, cleric, and sorcerer). These are
summed up on Tables 20-1 through 20-4.
246
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

These tables are based on the character wealth assumptions stated 
on Table 5-1, page 135 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The tables in the
Dungeon Master’s Guide are there to give a Dungeon Master an idea of
how much treasure a character of a certain level ought to have, which is
useful when creating new characters at higher than 1st level or for pacing
the rate of treasure acquisition the DM provides in his or her game. How-
ever, your character is not entitled to treasure and magic items of the
stated amount. Your character’s acquisition of treasure is entirely in the
hands of your Dungeon Master. You may lag behind drastically for a long
time, only to score an epic hoard by slaying a mighty dragon. Or your 
character might get lucky and find particular items that are significantly
more than he or she might normally be able to afford, based on these
assumptions.
That said, it’s a fairly common practice for DMs, when a player is starting
with a character above 1st level, to tell that player, “Make up a 5th-level 
character and equip him or her appropriately. You’ve got 9,000 gp for gear.”
Definitely check with your DM before you start shopping in the magic items
chapter of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
One more thing: In Tables 20-1 through 20-4, we use three conventions you
should know about. First, the abbreviation “MW” stands for “masterwork.”
(Masterwork items are described on page 122 and 126 of the Player’s Handbook.)
Second, the names of magic items are italicized. Third, your character might
have a fair amount of cash unspent at particular levels. You can use that cash
to pick out additional gear for your character or save it for a rainy day; it’s up
to you. If the cash balance includes an “or,” that’s because the table presents
you with two options at that level that have different costs — if you choose the
more expensive option, you’ll have less cash available.
The tables all list specific potions to buy, but feel free to swap the suggested
potions for any other potions of similar price.
Magic item descriptions begin on page 215 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
You’ll find the scoop on mithral armor on page 284.
Fighter magic items
If you’re playing a fighter, your primarily concern is finding good weapons
and armor. The better your character’s armament, the better he or she
fights. The items given in Table 20-1 also work well for barbarians, pala-
dins, and rangers — but if you’re playing a barbarian or ranger, make sure
you stick with the lighter armor. Table 20-1 lists the fighter’s magic items 
by level.

The table assumes that your character is using a longsword and composite
longbow, but if you prefer a different weapon (say, a bastard sword, great-
sword, or crossbow), just substitute the right weapon, and make a note of the
difference in price. For example, a nonmagical greatsword costs 50 gp to a non-
magical longsword’s 15 gp, so a +2 greatsword is 35 gp more expensive than a
+2 longsword. If you prefer to have your character fight at a distance, make a
bow your character’s primary magic weapon, and pick up an enchanted melee
weapon at the point where the table recommends a magical bow. 
Magic weapons often have really interesting special abilities that are paid for
by adding to the weapons’ plus value. For example, a flaming weapon deals an
additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each hit, but the flaming ability costs
a +1 bonus. In other words, a +2 longsword and a +1 flaming longsword have
the same monetary value: 8,315 gp. The flaming longsword effectively has a –1
penalty on attack rolls when compared to the +2 weapon, but it deals an aver-
age of +2.5 points of extra fire damage with each hit. If you have the opportu-
nity to buy or otherwise pick out for yourself the magical gear your character
owns, don’t overlook the cool special abilities available for weapons and
armor; you’ll find them on page 223 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Regarding armor, you’ll notice that we present two basic options on this 
table — a heavily armored fighter in full plate or a fast and maneuverable
fighter wearing a chain shirt. Don’t go with the light-armor option unless 
your character’s Dexterity score is 14 or better, because a fighter needs a
high Dexterity bonus to offset the fact that full plate armor has an armor
bonus 4 points higher than a chain shirt. If your fighter doesn’t use a shield,
put the extra money into a +1 ring of protection (it costs 2,000 gp) or +2 amulet
of health (a +2 bonus to your character’s Constitution for only 4,000 gp).
250
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Some of the simplest and most useful magic items in the game are “ability
adders” — items that increase your character’s ability scores. For example,
gauntlets of ogre power add a +2 bonus to your character’s Strength score.
That gives your character a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls
compared to the unenhanced Strength score, so clearly it helps a character
to fight better. You’ll also get a lot of benefit out of an amulet of health (which
improves your character’s Constitution score) or gloves of Dexterity (which
add to your character’s Dex score). Our fighter baseline in the preceding
table assumes that you acquire gauntlets of ogre power as quickly as possible,
but if you get the chance, upgrade to a belt of giant strength +4 (16,000 gp) or
+6 (36,000 gp). You’ll use that extra Strength every time your character
makes an attack.
Rogue magic items
A rogue wants to acquire good magic weapons as much as the fighter does,
but a rogue also wants to pick up interesting and useful magic items for avoid-
ing detection and getting around in the dungeon. These items are reasonably
good choices for bards as well as rogues, although a bard would substitute a
masterwork musical instrument for the thieves’ tools. Table 20-2 lists the
rogue’s magic items by level.

Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

As before, substitute your own preferred weapons if you don’t like the rapier
or shortbow. For example, if you’re playing an elf rogue, your character
should use a longbow instead of a shortbow because it deals more damage
and has a better range.
Unlike the fighter, the rogue has no real decision to make about armor — at
the earliest opportunity, your rogue should pick up a mithral chain shirt. It’s
the best light armor available, and it has no armor check penalty to get in the
way of a rogue’s attempts to be stealthy, graceful, or athletic. Magic studded
leather armor is a passable second choice.
For a rogue character, Dexterity is the ability you want to boost through the
roof. It helps with AC, Reflex saves, signature skills such as Hide and Move
Silently, and ranged attacks. If your rogue has the Weapon Finesse feat (and
most rogues should), it also helps with melee attacks. No other character can
get as much benefit from improving only one ability score, so we recommend
buying the best pair of gloves of Dexterity that you can afford. 
One more bit of advice to file away for later: Sooner or later, you’ll want to
acquire a ring of invisibility (20,000 gp). Turning invisible is one of the easiest
and most effective ways to generate sneak attack opportunities as well as
sneak into places you aren’t supposed to be, and any rogue worth his salt rel-
ishes both applications of the item. Until you can pony up the 20 grand, make
do with potions of invisibility, or get on the good side of a sorcerer with the
right spells.
Cleric magic items
Like the fighter, the cleric is also interested in picking up good magic weapons
and magic armor to stand up to anything the monsters might throw at him or
her. A cleric is also capable of using items that store divine spells, such as wands,
scrolls, and other such devices. Table 20-3 lists the cleric’s magic items by level.
You can use this table for druids as well, but you’ll need to make a few substi-
tutions. Use a scimitar in place of a mace and a sling in place of a crossbow,
and substitute hide or leather armor and wooden shields instead of the
cleric’s selection at that level.

If you’re playing a cleric, you are interested in improving your character’s
defense as much as you can by acquiring good armor. Your secondary goals
are keeping up your cleric’s melee attacks and helping your cleric’s spellcast-
ing. Because clerics usually don’t have great Dexterity scores, we’ve taken
the liberty of putting them in full plate armor. Your cleric should stick with
light shields instead of heavy shields, because a light shield allows a charac-
ter to hold another object in the shield hand — for example, your cleric’s
holy symbol, which is required for most spellcasting.
Because clerics are skilled spellcasters, your character has the ability to use
scrolls and wands with divine spells. After your cleric has gotten past 5th level
or so, these are probably even more important to you than the quality of your
cleric’s melee weapon, because a cleric will spend more of his or her combat
actions casting spells than thumping bad guys with a mace. A wand of cure 
light wounds costs only 750 gp and holds 50 uses of that spell — which means
it only costs 15 gp per use! Compare that to the normal cost of 50 gp for a
single potion of cure light wounds. The downside about the wand is that it takes
a long time to heal someone of 30 or 40 points of damage, but as long as your
character is not in combat, you shouldn’t mind taking some extra time to heal
characters on the cheap, without using up your cleric’s own spell slots. 
There are two good strategies for making the most out of your cleric’s ability
to use scrolls: Buying scrolls that are “over your head,” and buying scrolls of
“scrollbait” spells, as follows:
 Over-your-head scrolls: If you’re playing a 4th-level cleric, your character
can’t cast 3rd-level spells yet. However, your cleric can use a scroll with 
a 3rd-level spell on it. Scrolls are extremely cheap (at least compared to
257
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

potions or wands), so it’s a good strategy to look at the spells about one
level above what your character can normally cast and get a scroll or two
to cover spells that you think your character might need. Usually, these
will be spells that fix problems your character can’t otherwise fix at his or
her current level, such as neutralize poison, remove disease, or raise dead.
 Scrollbait scrolls: Many spells are only useful in very specific situations.
For example, it’s usually a waste of time to prepare the spell water
breathing. What are the odds that any given dungeon adventure is going
to require the party to adventure underwater? But, if you find that you
need it, you really need it. 
Spellcasters get just as much benefit from ability-improving items as fighters
and rogues. In the case of the cleric, you want to improve your character’s
Wisdom score, because a high Wisdom score means that his or her spells are
harder to resist and that he or she gains more bonus spells. The periapt of
Wisdom is a must-buy for any cleric who can afford it. After you’ve boosted
your cleric’s Wisdom score with a magic item, look for opportunities to
improve your character’s Strength and Constitution scores (gauntlets of ogre
power, belt of giant strength, or amulet of health are the relevant wondrous
items). A better Strength score increases melee attack power, and a higher
Constitution gives your character more hit points and a better Fortitude save.
Sorcerer magic items
Unlike every other character, a sorcerer has no real use for magic weapons or
armor. Spells are the weapons of choice for a sorcerer, and a sorcerer can’t
wear armor anyway. However, sorcerers are very interested in finding items
that help defend them from physical attack; most of their defense comes from
their choice of magic items. Sorcerers also have the ability to employ deadly
magical weaponry in the form of scrolls, wands, and other spell-storage
devices. Table 20-4 lists the sorcerer’s magic items by level.
Wizards can use this table just as well as sorcerers, but you may want to change
the emphasis on the particular scrolls and wands you choose. Sorcerers should
pick scrolls and wands that diversify their powers, allowing them to get around
their limitation in the small number of spells they know. Wizards should pick up
magic items that allow them cheap and disposable offense, so that they’ve got
attack magic to fall back on during extended battles.

For sorcerers, one of their biggest weaknesses is their inability to wear
armor. That means you should acquire magic items that provide bonuses to
your sorcerer’s Armor Class as soon as possible. The most obvious way to do
this is with bracers of armor; you’ll find that bracers of armor +3 are just as
good as studded leather armor (but unfortunately, they’re far more expen-
sive). Other magic items that offer some defense include:
 Ring of protection: A ring of protection adds a deflection bonus to your
character’s AC. Minor rings (+1 or +2) are pretty common in the game;
better rings are prohibitively expensive.
 Amulet of natural armor: An amulet of natural armor provides a nat-
ural armor bonus. Just like rings of protection, minor amulets (+1 or +2)
are fairly commonplace, but more powerful amulets are quite expensive.
 Robes of the archmagi: These magic robes give your sorcerer a +5
armor bonus to AC, in addition to a host of other cool magic powers.
The downside: They’re quite pricey at 75,000 gp. But you can always
dream, can’t you?
Like the cleric, the sorcerer’s ability as a spellcaster allows your character to
use scrolls, wands, and staffs with great skill. In fact, there’s not much point
in carrying a crossbow around by the time your character gets to 3rd level or
261
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

so, because he or she ought to be toting a wand of magic missiles for a pri-
mary ranged attack.
The ability-adding item you are most interested in is the cloak of Charisma.
With a higher Charisma score, your sorcerer’s spells get harder to resist, and
your character also gains more bonus spells. However, the sorcerer has to
pay a heavy price for his or her signature ability-boosting item. All other
characters can use a cloak of resistance, which improves their saving throws
with a relatively inexpensive item purchase. Characters can’t wear two cloaks
at the same time, so you’ll have to decide what’s more important: offense or
defense. (If you’re playing a wizard, you dodge this bullet — you want to
increase your character’s Intelligence score, not Charisma, so you need to
buy a headband of intellect, which means your wizard can still use a cloak of
resistance.)

W
e spend most of this book immersed in the nuts and bolts of charac-
ter creation and the mechanics of game play. But DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
isn’t just a game of statistics and rules. It’s also a game of imagination. When
you take control of your D&D character, you can pretend for a short time that
you’re someone else entirely — a mighty swordsman, a dangerous wizard, a
sly and cunning rogue — and that all the evil in the world can be beaten
senseless with a broadsword or a wand of lightning bolt. In fact, for a lot of
people, roleplaying (the process of pretending you’re someone else) is the
whole reason they play the game. Character statistics and game rules just
help you figure out what happens next.
In this chapter, we tell you about the art of roleplaying and show you how to
breathe personality, life, and purpose into your character. We also take a look
at ways you can make yourself appreciated by everyone else at the table,
both as a character and a player.
Roleplaying with Style
D&D is very entertaining as a pure tactical exercise; many players are per-
fectly content to view the game as consisting of puzzles to be solved, many of
which involve fantastic combat scenarios. But the game really shines when
you make an effort to get out of your own skin and put yourself in the place of
the character you’ve brought to the table. After all, in real life, you’d run
screaming from a howling, blood-maddened werewolf intent on ripping your
throat out and tearing you limb from limb. But your dashing rogue Saros can

stand his ground calmly, rapier in hand, and even make a quip about his fear-
some foe. It’s not that much more of a leap to think about how Saros might
respond to other sorts of challenges and situations.
Choosing your character’s alignment
One of your best guides for roleplaying your character is a fundamental rule
of the game: Every character (as well as NPCs and intelligent monsters) in
the game has an alignment. Alignment is a quick summary of what your char-
acter stands for and how he or she tries to live life. Your choice marks your
character as a good guy or a bad guy, and alignment allows you to quickly
determine how other folks in the world see your character — and how you
should see others. For example, you can see at a glance that a lawful good
dwarf probably has nothing kind to say to a chaotic evil orc, and vice versa.
Alignment consists of two intersecting scales. The first is ethos: lawful, neu-
tral, or chaotic. The second is morality: good, neutral, or evil. Someone who
is lawful good chose the good component on the morality scale and the
lawful component on the ethos scale. Here’s a quick primer on these five
components:
 Good: You are generally unwilling to hurt others to get ahead. You are
altruistic, protect innocent life, and believe in the dignity of all beings.
You’re willing to make personal sacrifices to help others.
 Evil: You feel free to hurt, oppress, or kill others if it suits your ends.
Maybe you lack compassion or maybe you think moral conventions
shackle you and keep you from taking what’s yours. Or maybe you
wallow in the vile, the despicable, and the depraved, celebrating evil
gods and hurting others for the sheer pleasure of it.
 Lawful: You believe that you are bound to uphold the codes, laws, and
standards of behavior of your culture and society. You voluntarily subju-
gate your personal gain to the rules and expectations of the society you
live in.
 Chaotic: You believe that individual freedom is the greatest virtue a soci-
ety can offer. You think that rules are made to be broken, and that
notions such as honor codes or even sacred oaths should be discarded
if they get in the way of common sense. Society exists to exalt the indi-
vidual, not the other way around.
 Neutral: You haven’t taken a stand on one, the other, or both of the
alignment scales. If you’re neutral with regard to good and evil, you
might be a person who tries to accomplish good ends but is willing to
use evil means to achieve them. If you’re neutral with respect to law and
chaos, you have a normal respect for authority but don’t feel any real
compulsion to follow rules or break them.
264
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

This system results in nine possible alignments: lawful good, neutral good,
chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil,
and chaotic evil.
Your character’s code of behavior and personal standards should reflect his
or her alignment. For example, if your character is chaotic good, he or she
acts as his or her conscience dictates to help people, without caring about
what other people expect of him or her. The character especially hates it when
people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. On the other hand, a
lawful evil character plays by the rules, but has no mercy or compassion. He
or she seeks power and wealth, and doesn’t care who gets hurt on his or her
way up — but he or she adheres to the codes, laws, or standards of his or her
race or society, using these as tools to further his or her own ends.
You can read more about how your character’s alignment influences his or
her approach to life on pages 104–106 of the Player’s Handbook.
What alignment you choose is generally up to you, but keep in mind that a
number of character classes have specific alignment requirements. For exam-
ple, paladins must be of lawful good alignment, while barbarians cannot be
lawful (they’re not much for following rules). Your Dungeon Master may warn
you that your character’s actions are not conforming to his or her chosen
alignment. If you have your character act in an evil manner, your DM may
rule that your alignment is, in fact, evil — evil is as evil does, after all. If your
character’s alignment changes, he or she may lose some class benefits. Check
your character class’s description to see if you need to have your character
stick to a particular alignment.
Be careful about playing an evil character. Many DMs prefer that all the char-
acters in the party be good or neutral in alignment. It makes a lot more sense
for good or neutral characters to take up adventures about protecting the
innocent or stopping the depredations of evil monsters. It’s also easier for
good or neutral characters to cooperate within the party. The game works
fine no matter what alignment you choose, but you should check with the DM
before you decide on an evil alignment for your character.
Building a persona
Alignment is a pretty broad brush to paint with. It tells you something about
what your character stands for and how he or she thinks the universe ought
to run, but it doesn’t tell you much about his or her personality. Consider the
lawful good paladin: You’re just a goody two-shoes, right? Well, you might
play that paladin as a saintly martyr, a beatific and blameless agent of good
who goes willingly to face nigh-certain death in the service of his or her deity.
Or the character might be a grim crusader, tireless and unswerving in his or
her determination to bring justice to evil wherever it lurks. Or you might
265
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

even play that paladin as a great captain, a bold and courageous leader who
urges on his or her companions with never-say-die cheerfulness and confi-
dence. How you play that character is up to you.
Personas tend to evolve in play; your character ought to learn from his or her
adventures and experiences, just like a real person does. But, as a place to
get started, take a look at the traits below and decide where your character
falls on the scale between each extreme:
Arrogant – Humble
Avaricious – Ascetic
Blunt – Tactful
Brave – Not so brave
Devious – Straightforward
Driven – Lackadaisical
Flexible – Stubborn
Flippant – Serious
Naïve – Cynical
Pleasant – Irascible
Reckless – Cautious
Sincere – Duplicitous
Talkative – Taciturn
Trusting – Suspicious
Pick two to four character traits, and in conjunction with your character’s
alignment, race, and class, you should have enough to craft a reasonably
unique character. Some traits may be a little hard to reconcile with some
alignments, but maybe those traits are weaknesses or failings — places
where your character doesn’t quite measure up to his or her self-imposed
standards. 
Creating mannerisms
Now that you know what your character stands for and what sort of personal-
ity he or she has, think of ways that you can portray that easily and consis-
tently at the gaming table. You don’t have to view each D&D session as a trip to
the Renaissance Faire in full costume, but if you can think of a couple of memo-
rable “hooks” to use at the table, you’ll find that the other players have an
easier time envisioning who your character is and what he or she stands for.

Habitual sayings
Does your character have any distinctive trademark phrases or battle cries?
If you can’t think of any, look to your character’s choice of deity. Dwarves
usually worship Moradin, the god of the dwarves. If you’re playing a dwarf,
you could do worse than to swear, “By Moradin’s beard!” or “Moradin’s
hammer, what a bad idea that was!”
Voice or speech pattern
Take on a unique character voice or way of speaking that you can manage so
easily you forget you’re doing it. If you’re playing a dwarf, growl and splutter
and talk like you are angry. If you’re playing a half-orc with a low Intelligence
score, frown seriously and speak slowly, like you’re working hard to sort out
what you’re trying to say. If you’re playing a pretentious sorcerer or imperi-
ous wizard, refer to yourself in the third person (like “Leon” in the Budweiser
commercials), or even use the “royal we.” Maybe your chivalrous paladin
even uses a few “thees” and “thous.” If Thor can shout, “I SAY THEE NAY!” in
Marvel comics, it’ll work for you at the gaming table.
Gestures
This is a little harder, because there’s only so much you can do while seated 
at a table. But maybe your pious cleric Jorune steeples his fingers in front of
his chest when he speaks, while your devious rogue Shadow rubs her hands
together avariciously, or your intellectual wizard Evard strokes his beard (or
chin, if you lack the necessary facial hair) and casts his eyes up toward the 
ceiling while he contemplates a decision. Facial expressions are good ground
for role playing, too. You can scowl or glower, stare stupidly with a slack-jawed
expression, or squint crookedly and mutter to yourself. (We just sort of hope
you don’t do those things normally, so that your friends can actually detect
that your efforts are roleplaying.)
Favored tactics
Here’s an easy one that doesn’t require any out-of-your-skin acting at all: Pick
a couple of things your character likes to do, and make those your favored
tactics. If your barbarian recklessly charges into battle and always Power
Attacks for the maximum possible on the first round of combat, that’s a dis-
tinctive hook — everybody at the table will start looking for you to try it in
every fight. Maybe your sorcerer loves electricity spells, and so uses lightning
bolt in preference to any other spell. Look for trademark maneuvers and try
to put your own distinctive stamp on them.
Knowing when to stop
Believe it or not, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. Different D&D
groups have different standards for how much roleplaying is the right
amount; we’ve played in very entertaining game sessions in which no dice
267
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

were rolled at all, because the nights were taken up with tense negotiations
or tricky sets of investigations and interviews, all resolved purely in “charac-
ter voice.” But sometimes you need to stop talking and start rolling the dice.
If D&D had referees who kept an eye on your roleplaying, here are three
things that would draw penalty flags:
 Delay of game: Sometimes a dungsweeper is just a dungsweeper. Don’t
expect that you have to engage in meaningful conversation with every
nonplayer character (NPC) your character happens upon. We’ve seen
people spend 30 minutes of real-time haggling with a shopkeeper over
the price of a pick and shovel. For goodness’ sake, just have your char-
acter throw a couple of gold pieces on the counter and get on with the
real adventure! You might not have noticed the other players at the table
gnawing off their own ears because you won’t give it a rest.
 Excessive roleplaying: A little bit of real-world acting goes a long way.
Talk in a funny accent, scowl and glare a lot, use acidic sarcasm (hope-
fully not directed at other players), but don’t take it too far. We’ve seen a
player who insisted on perching on her chair and screeching unintelligi-
bly for hours on end because her druid character was wildshaped into
an eagle. When you freak out or annoy the other players, you’re roleplay-
ing excessively.
 Intentional grounding: Try not to have your character take stupid or
counterproductive actions because you think that’s what your character
should do. For example: “Well, Kerro is scared of undead, so I guess I’ll
spend this round yammering in terror. Oh, I know I made my saving
throw. But I think it’s what Kerro would do.” Be a little helpful to the rest
of the party, and roleplay Kerro overcoming his fright enough to swing a
sword or cast a spell, even though he’s shaking in his boots. Your friends
will like Kerro much better that way.
Working Together
Every character in the D&D game is the best at something, but no character
can be the best at everything. What that means is simple: Good teamwork is a
skill of vital importance to a D&D party. Learning how to cooperate with the
other players at the table and work together effectively is important.
The first rule of working together is building a balanced adventuring party.
Every character class has strengths and weaknesses; for example, if everyone
in the group plays wizards, all the characters will be terribly vulnerable to
monsters fast enough to reach them before they can drop the monsters with
their spells. A party of nothing but fighters has no way to get past a 20-foot-
wide pit in a corridor, but a rogue might be able to climb across, or a wizard
might be able to overcome the obstacle with a simple low-level spell such as
jump or spider climb.
268
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

The second rule of working together is making sure that everybody has the
opportunity to do what he or she does best. For example, don’t put the
party’s rogue in the position of being a front-line combatant; make sure the
fighter in the party is standing in front of the bad guys, so that the rogue has
the opportunity to maneuver for a flank attack.
The third rule of working together is staying on top of what your allies are
trying to do. If your party’s wizard is about to unleash a fireball spell, don’t
have your fighter run right into the middle of the orc warriors to launch an
attack — the wizard won’t be able to throw him or her spell without endan-
gering your character. Don’t be afraid to engage in a little “table-talk” and ask
other players what they’re planning. Most DMs don’t mind a reasonable
amount of table-talk, as long as you don’t start designing ten-step battle plans
in the middle of combat.
Cooperating in a fight
As you might expect, the most important place to use good teamwork and
cooperative tactics is in a fight. When you fail to cooperate outside of
combat, the result is usually not too much more serious than a delay of some
kind. When you fail to cooperate in a fight, you’re likely to get somebody’s
character killed. Death is not a permanent career-ender in D&D, but it’s no
fun, either. It costs a lot of gold pieces, experience points, or both to bring a
character back from the dead, so it behooves everybody at the table to work
hard to make sure that nobody’s character gets killed.
Cooperative tactic #1: Flanking
The first tactic everybody should use is flanking. Flanking involves catching
monsters directly in between two allies. If you and your buddy can work
together to flank a monster, you each get a +2 bonus on your attack rolls.
Moreover, if one or the other of you happens to be playing a rogue, the player
will also get your bonus sneak attack damage against the flanked foe.
If you don’t have enough friends available to flank a monster (or it’s just too
dangerous to move to a flanking position), a spellcaster can manufacture a
flanking situation by casting a summon monster spell. By placing a conjured
monster on the opposite side of a foe as the fighter or rogue in the party, the
fighter or rogue will fight better due to the flanking bonus, even if the sum-
moned creature isn’t all that powerful. (Don’t worry, the summoned monster
is strictly on your side.)
Cooperative tactic #2: Aiding another
When you’re fighting an enemy who is very hard to hit, or you need to give a
character in trouble the best defense possible against an attack, consider
using the aid another action. (You’ll find a description of this action on page
154 of the Player’s Handbook.) Instead of making an attack against your foe,
269
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

you can make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you succeed, your friend
gains either a +2 attack bonus or a +2 Armor Class bonus.
Here’s an example: Say two characters are fighting an opponent with an
Armor Class of 24. One character has an attack bonus of +5 and deals an aver-
age of 5.5 points of damage per hit (using a +1 longsword), and the other has
an attack bonus of +8 and deals an average of 11 points of damage per hit (+1
greatsword with 14 Strength). If they both just attack, the expected damage is
2.75 plus 0.55, or 3.3 points of damage per round. If the weaker character aids
the better, there’s an 80 percent chance the average damage output jumps to
3.85, because the weaker character successfully aids another on a roll of 5 or
higher. (There’s a 20 percent chance the damage output drops to 2.75, too.)
That averages out to an expected damage output of 3.63 instead of 3.3 for
attacking separately.
Cooperative tactic #3: Delaying
It’s only natural to jump up the instant your turn comes around and whack
the bad guys. But sometimes, the smartest way to play is to be a little patient.
If you think that you’ve got an ally who will move before the monster does,
you can delay your action and wait for your ally to get into position. By wait-
ing, you might give yourself and your friend the benefit of making a flanking
attack when that opportunity didn’t exist before.
Delaying is also a good tactic when you’ve got spellcasters on your side who
have spells that might help everyone attack. If the cleric in your party is
about to cast a bless spell, you can simply wait to make your attack until after
the cleric casts his or her spell. Now you’ve got a free +1 morale bonus on
your attack roll that didn’t exist before the cleric took her turn. Obviously, if
the cleric’s turn comes up after the monster(s) take their turn, you might not
want to wait. But keep an eye on the initiative order in the fight, and look for
opportunities to coordinate your actions for the greatest effect.
Buffing: Making your character 
and the team better
Spellcasting characters have a direct and obvious way to work cooperatively:
They can cast buffing spells. The term buffing means improving a character
with magic or special abilities, so that he or she can fight better. A spell such
as bull’s strength is a perfect example of a buffing spell — the character on the
receiving end of this spell temporarily gains a +4 Strength bonus, which trans-
lates into a +2 bonus to the recipient’s attack and damage rolls. Little
bonuses go a long way in a D&D game. Table 21-1 lists some great buffing
spells.

Some characters have innate abilities that work just as well or even better
than spells to buff other characters. The bard is the master of buffing his or
her friends, because several of the most powerful bard song effects grant
bonuses to all the bard’s allies. Similarly, the paladin has an aura of fearless-
ness that grants any character standing within 10 feet of the paladin a bonus
on saves against fear effects.
The real trick in managing your buffing spells and effects lies in finding
effects that stack — that is, two or more bonuses of different types that work
in combination to give an even greater benefit. In general, effects of the same
type don’t add together. For example, gauntlets of ogre power provide a 
+2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and the bull’s strength spell provides a +4
enhancement bonus to Strength. Because these bonuses are of the same
type, you only use the best one. In other words, it’s inefficient to throw your
bull’s strength spell on the character wearing the gauntlets, because he or she
will get a smaller benefit from the spell than another character would.
271
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

Armor Class is another good example of where you want to be careful to
make sure that magical items and buffing spells will stack. The barkskin spell
adds a natural armor bonus to the recipient, while shield of faith adds a
deflection bonus. You can throw both these spells on the same character, and
he or she will get full benefit for both. But watch out for a ring of protection or
an amulet of natural armor — the shield of faith won’t stack with the ring, and
barkskin won’t stack with the amulet, because the spells and items give the
same type of bonus to AC. Usually, dodge bonuses and untyped bonuses (a
bonus not assigned any descriptive term) are the only AC bonuses that stack
with each other.
Saving downed characters
Sooner or later, it’s going to happen: Some character in the party is knocked
to 0 or negative hit points by a monster’s attack. (A character is disabled at 0
hit points, a character is dying when his or her hit points are –1 to –9, and a
character dies when his or her hit points reach –10 or less. For more details,
see the “Injury and Death” section in Chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook.)
Getting that character back into the fight requires some real cooperation and
clever play, especially if the fight’s still going on. What do you do when one of
the other characters drops?
You have two ways to fix a character sitting in negative hit points: Stabilize
him or her with the Heal skill, or use a cure wounds spell (or potion) of some
variety (which automatically stabilizes the dying character and may bring
him or her back to positive hit points, depending on how many points of
damage are cured). The Heal skill is by far the inferior approach; use curing
magic if you have any at all. 
Try this short checklist the next time a character goes down in your game:
 Is the character beyond help? If your companion’s been reduced to –10
hit points or less, there’s no hurry. The character is dead, and he or she
won’t get any deader.
 Is the character in immediate danger of dying? A character reduced to
–1 or –2 hit points won’t die right away. You might be able to wait for
the right chance to aid him or her. However, watch out if there are mon-
sters standing around with nothing better to do than finish off a help-
less character. 
 Can you help the character? If you have no healing potions or spells,
and can’t use the Heal skill worth a darn, you might not be able to do
much good anyway. You can stand over your fallen friend and keep a
monster from finishing him or her off, but that’s about it.
272
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

 Can you reach the character? You might have no way to actually get to
a dying comrade. If you’re threatened by dangerous enemies and might
cause your own character’s death by trying to reach your buddy, you
might only complicate the situation by trying to help.
 Can you afford the action to help this round? Usually, it’s good play to
try to get your friends back into a fight. But if spending your turn going
to your fallen friend’s aid will give the monster or villain the opportunity
to wreak even more damage, you might not be able to afford the luxury
of ignoring the bad guys to aid your friend. For example, if you’ve got the
dragon down to just a couple of hit points, you might be smarter to try
to finish it off than to let it take another turn.
 Will you make the character a target by healing him or her? Generally,
intelligent monsters don’t waste actions pounding on adventurers who
are already down as long as there are others still on their feet and fight-
ing. If you’re battling a frost giant berserker who lays out 40 points of
damage with each swing of his or her axe, the safest place for your
wounded friend might be lying helpless in the low- to mid-negatives.
When you heal your friend up to 10 or 15 hit points, you place him or
her in the very dangerous position of being easy to kill outright with just
one more attack. Make sure the frost giant’s got something better to do
than cut your friend in half when he or she stands up.
Minding Your Table Manners
So far in this chapter, we talk about a lot of things you do to breathe life into
your character and to play your character constructively with the other play-
ers at the table. Now we broach a somewhat awkward topic: Your behavior as
a player, not just a person controlling a character in the game.
Most D&D games are regularly occurring social gatherings of a group of friends
who share a common interest. Just like weekly poker games, or PlayStation
slugfests, or bar crawls, or whatever it is you do for fun with your friends, it’s
just good manners to be a considerate guest or a pleasant host. You want to
have fun and help everyone else have fun; you don’t want to be the guy or gal
who’s making everyone else miserable.
The following sections take a quick look at five things you can do to contribute
to everyone’s gaming experience, and five things you ought to avoid if you
want everyone to have fun.
273
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

Five dos
It would be easy to give you a long list of things to avoid, but we don’t think
that’s as helpful as pointing out some positive steps you can take right from
the get-go to make game night more fun for everyone:
 Think about what you want to do on your turn while other people are
taking their turns: Time is the single most precious commodity at the
gaming table. Most D&D sessions run about three or four hours. If you
take ten minutes to figure out what your perfect move is during each
round of every combat you get into, you’re taking more than your share.
Instead of everybody getting a chance to bash through five or six excit-
ing encounters in the course of that session, you might limit them to half
that many. Plan ahead so that your turns don’t take forever, and every-
one gets to play more D&D.
The minute your turn ends, start thinking about what you’re going to do
on your next turn. If you’re playing a spellcaster, figure out which of your
spells you’re likely to use when your turn comes up again. If you’re play-
ing a fighting character, think about which foe you’re going to attack,
and whether or not you need to maneuver or use any special feats.
Sometimes your plans will get spoiled by things that happen when it’s
not your turn — but sometimes they won’t, and you’ll give everybody at
the table a little more D&D for their time.
 Do the math ahead of time: By the third or fourth time you’ve attacked
with your longsword, you ought to know what your attack bonus is. Ditto
for the save DC on that fireball spell you cast three or four times a night.
Don’t figure these things out from scratch each time you pick up the 
dice — be proactive and organized. Look at the actions you undertake all
the time, and add up your bonuses and modifiers before you come to the
table. No one minds too much if you don’t know your character’s grapple
check modifier off the top of your head, but you shouldn’t have to figure
out your Armor Class each and every time some monster takes a swing 
at you.
Part of this tip involves figuring some numbers before you come to the
game, but the other part of this tip is hard for some folks: Write things
down in places where you can find them easily. It doesn’t matter if you
figure out your complete Power Attack options for every conceivable
monster AC you might face if you lose your notes at the table. We suggest
using a standard character sheet for this sort of thing; you can find one in
the back of the Player’s Handbook, pick up the D&D Deluxe Character
Sheets pack, or check out a thousand variations by poking around the
Internet. Wizards of the Coast provides free character sheets in PDF
274
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

format, which you can download and print out, at www.wizards.com/
default.asp?x=dnd/welcome (click Character Sheets on the left side of
the page to see the list of downloadable PDFs). (Check out Chapter 10 for
an example of a character sheet.)
 Exercise some common courtesy: If you told your buddies you were
going to meet them at 7 o’clock to go out to the movies, you wouldn’t
expect them to be happy with you if you wandered in at quarter past
eight. The same thing applies for a D&D game. Show up on time so your
buddies don’t have to wait for you before they start playing. If you find
you can’t be on time, use a phone and call somebody to let ’em know
you’ll be late. At least that way your friends can decide whether to wait
for you or to start the game without you.
Miss Manners is right more often than she’s wrong at the gaming table.
Throw in some cash for the pizza. Bring the chips and soda (at least
some of the time). Be a good guest. Heck, you know this stuff. Just be
considerate.
 Stay on target, stay focused, stay in the game: Every D&D game we’ve
ever attended featured at least some amount of senseless cutting up and
Monty Python movie quotes for no particular reason. Gaming is fun; it’s a
social activity. Part of the reason you’re at the table is because you enjoy
the company of the people you’re gaming with, and you want to socialize.
But try to recognize when people are trying to move the game along 
and get somewhere, and when people are kicking back and shooting the
breeze. 
When the game’s on, pay attention to what’s going down. If the Dungeon
Master is talking, pay attention! Nothing is more annoying than a DM
giving a crucial encounter set-up, adventure background, or key bit of
NPC conversation, only to have one of the players pipe up and say,
“Huh? I was looking at my spells.”
 Help your friends to shine: This one’s a little tough. When you have the
chance to grab the spotlight, it’s natural to want to do exactly that. But
sometimes it’s actually more rewarding to let another player at the table
have that moment in the sun.
Try to look out for situations that a particular character is suited for, and
defer to that other character if you can. For example, if you’re playing an
armor-plated fighter, and the party needs to scout out a side passage that
might lead into a monster’s lair, you might say, “I’m the toughest guy, I’ll
go look.” Or you might look over to your friend who’s playing the stealthy
rogue and say, “Steve, Kerdigard’s no good at scouting. I’ll follow your
lead on this.” Every character at the table is the best at something, so let
your friends show off at the things their characters do best.
275
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

Five don’ts
Now for the flip side — here are some things you should try to avoid doing at
the table:
 Don’t hog the spotlight: If there are four players and a DM at the table,
you should assume that you’re entitled to about one-quarter of the DM’s
time. If you insist on being the character who scouts every tunnel, tack-
les every puzzle, talks to every NPC, and dictates the strategy for every
fight, you’re being a bore. You’re not the star of the show; D&D is a
movie with an ensemble cast, so you have to expect that sometimes
other players will get good lines too.
It’s usually okay to take point on something that your character is the
best at, or roleplay a long conversation that’s of vital interest to your
character, but remember that you’ve got the spotlight, and it’s good to
share it.
 Don’t disrespect the other characters: Back in the Dark Old Days of
gaming, many players understood D&D to be a fiercely competitive
game. Squabbling over the best magic items in treasure hoards, stealing
from inattentive allies, or even bullying lower-level characters were
accepted behaviors in some games. None of that old-school garbage flies
these days. Who wants to use their leisure time to play in a game where
their characters get picked on, shoved around, or stolen from? We’d
rather go back to grade school.
So don’t slip the DM notes saying that your 10th-level rogue is going to
pick the fighter’s pockets when he isn’t looking. Don’t threaten to vapor-
ize your allies with a disintegrate spell if they don’t let you have the +4
ring of protection the evil wizard was wearing. Don’t sneer at people, or
run down their characters, or generally go out of your way to let them
know how stupid you think they are for being in the same game with
you. It doesn’t play well in real life, and it’s just as unwelcome at the
gaming table. 
 Don’t be a poor loser: It’s natural to want to be successful in the game.
When things don’t go your way, try not to take it personally. Sometimes
your character’s going to get killed in horrific and spectacular ways. It
happens.
We’ve seen more than a few players absolutely enraged, embittered, or
brought to the point of tears by the death of a beloved character. If you
play a long-running campaign and get attached to your alter ego in the
DM’s world, it’s only natural to feel disappointed when the game doesn’t
go your way. Try to remember, if your character’s never in any real
danger, there isn’t all that much excitement to any game. On occasion,
you’re going to have a character get mauled, because the other 90 per-
cent of the time, it’s way more exciting to be worried about what’s going
to happen next.
276
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Usually, characters get killed in one of two ways: You did something
stupid and it didn’t work out, or a monster just got lucky. When an ogre
crits your 2nd-level sorcerer and deals out 33 points of damage, well, the
ogre got lucky. Why get mad about it? The vast majority of DMs don’t
start an encounter with the intent of killing a specific character, so don’t
blame the Dungeon Master! That’s just the way the dice fell. Besides,
truly horrific character deaths make for great “war stories.”
 Don’t disrespect the supporting cast: Most D&D adventures are popu-
lated with a whole host of “supporting cast” — nonplayer characters the
DM uses to populate the places your character visits. Sometimes these
NPCs are patrons or employers who give your character directions to the
adventure. Sometimes they’re sources of information, folks who might
know interesting rumors or who can point you toward useful resources.
And sometimes they’re nothing more than window dressing, a little bit of
color the DM uses to give you a chance to roleplay your character. It’s
bad form to make the DM feel stupid for putting a “talky” encounter in
front of you instead of something your character can just kill.
So how do players abuse NPCs? One classic bit is acting like a thug or
putting on a show of sneering superiority because you’re pretty sure your
character is a few levels higher than the poor schmuck he or she is talking
to. We don’t know why some players enjoy the pretend-bullying of imagi-
nary people, but they do. Another common tactic is the “outrageous
insult and take-back.” It runs like this: “I shove my wand of lightning bolts
up the baron’s nose and ask him if he’d like his brains all over the ceiling.
Ha, ha! No, I don’t do that. I disintegrate a hole in his castle wall, and then
tell him he’d better get his daughters down here for me to check out, or
he’s gonna learn how to fly real quick! No, I don’t really do that.”
The point of all this is that there’s constructive roleplaying, and there’s
destructive roleplaying. While you’re slapping around the town guards
because you’re playing a 10th-level character and they’re 1st-level NPCs,
the clock’s running on the real adventure, and the DM isn’t having any
fun. You want to keep the DM happy and show his or her game world
some respect.
 Don’t argue with the DM: The Dungeon Master is not infallible.
Sometimes he or she will remember a rule wrong, or forget that you are
holding your action, or overlook an obvious plot hole in the adventure.
But it’s accepted gaming etiquette to let the DM run the game as he or
she sees fit. The DM is the guy or gal who’s putting in a lot of extra work
to make the game fun for everybody else. Cut him or her some slack.
That said, you’re within your rights to ask a DM to check a rule that you
think he or she got wrong. If the DM says, “Joe, your fighter Kerdigard is
charmed by the evil wizard, so you have to attack your buddies,” you
can point out that you agree that Kerdigard can’t attack the evil wizard,
but you’re not sure if the charm person spell automatically turns you
277
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

against your friends. If the DM insists he or she is right, the best thing to
do is let it slide, and go along with the way the DM wants to play it. That
way you don’t stop the game altogether and leave the other players sit-
ting around waiting for the argument to resolve. You can always take up
your point later on, after the game session is over. 
If the DM is spectacularly wrong, spitefully inconsistent, uses NPCs to
bully your characters (see the previous bullet), or refuses to be ques-
tioned, you’re dealing with a pocket tyrant. You’ll have to decide if you
can submit to playing the game by the, ah, unique rules the DM uses for
his or her game, or if you’d rather not let this person tyrannize your
gaming time. If the DM is a great storyteller, maybe you can put up with
his or her butchery of the rules. But if he or she runs a bad game all
around, maybe someone else at the table would be a better DM.

any players are perfectly happy choosing a character class and sticking
to it, spending their character’s whole career getting better at the path
laid out in the Player’s Handbook. However, some players are fanatics about
building the toughest, most capable, most specialized character they can
come up with. In fact, thousands of D&D players constantly debate the virtues
of various character builds (combinations of race, class, feat, and spell choices)
and share their efforts with each other in hundreds of message boards and
mailing lists. When you factor in the zillions of additional options for classes,
feats, and other such things available in other D&D supplements (for example,
Complete Warrior, Races of Stone, or the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting),
your character building options are effectively infinite.
In this chapter, we discuss the art of extreme character building and show
you how to use some advanced tactics to maximize your character’s
strengths and minimize weaknesses.
Min-Maxing Your Character
D&D is a tough game on your character. Fierce orc berserkers try to hack him
or her into quivering chunks of meat with huge axes. Giants try to stomp a
character into bloody paste. Dragons want to incinerate a character like
flamethrowers with wings. And, as if that weren’t enough, a character spends
most of his or her time stumbling through dismal dungeons with fun features
like hidden pits full of rusty spikes and the occasional yawning gate leading
directly to the infernal planes. To survive and thrive in this admittedly hostile
environment, you need to build the strongest character you can put together.

The art of optimizing your character is known (somewhat derogatorily) as
min-maxing. When you min-max, you’re looking for corners in the game rules.
You’re trying to make sure that you’re getting the most you possibly can out
of your character design.
Here’s an example: Say you’re trying to build a rogue who’s good in melee
combat. Your rogue character has a Strength score of 12 and a Dexterity score
of 16. At 1st level, your character’s attack bonus with the rapier is +1 (+0 for
your base attack bonus, +1 for your Strength bonus). You’d like to choose the
feats Weapon Focus or Weapon Finesse to improve your character’s attack
with the rapier, but both of these feats require a base attack bonus of +1, so
your 1st-level character can’t choose either one yet. When your character
reaches 2nd level, your attack bonus with the rapier improves to +2 (base
attack bonus +1 for a 2nd-level rogue, +1 for Strength as before) — but your
character still can’t take Weapon Focus or Weapon Finesse, because he or she
doesn’t get a feat selection at 2nd level.
The min-maxer, on the other hand, doesn’t take a level in the rogue class when
his or her character advances a level. Instead, he or she has the character
take a level in the fighter class. (This is called multiclassing — we discuss it
later in this chapter.) By choosing to be a 1st-level rogue/1st-level fighter, the
min-maxer’s character still has a base attack bonus of +1, just like the 2nd-level
rogue. But the fighter class offers a bonus feat at 1st level. The min-maxer
chooses Weapon Finesse at 2nd level. This gives the character an attack bonus
with the rapier of +4 (+1 for base attack, +3 for Dexterity bonus). Compare that
to the +2 bonus a 2nd-level rogue would have. As you can see, some creative
and informed character building can pay off big.

Character optimization resources
You can build a bewildering variety of compe-
tent, min-maxed characters using just the core
rulebooks — the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and the Monster Manual. But
wait, there’s more! If you like exploring various
character builds and assembling the best char-
acters you can imagine from the material at
hand, you’ll find that other D&D supplements
offer tons of additional options. Check out
Races of Stone, Races of the Wild, Complete
Warrior, Complete Divine, Complete Arcane,
and Complete Adventurer just for starters. 
In addition to looking for new options in other D&D
supplements, you’ll find that thousands of D&D
fans discuss their favorite character-building
tricks with each other every day. If you want to
find good character builds fast, we recommend a
visit to the official D&D message boards, hosted
by Wizards of the Coast, the folks who publish the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. You’ll find the mes-
sage boards at www.wizards.com. Another
good source of ideas is Dragon Magazine, a
monthly publication chock full of good D&D tidbits;
you can find a copy at your local gaming store. 

Min-maxing strategies
There are three basic courses you can follow when optimizing your character:
 Maximizing strengths: Pick something you do well and throw every
resource available into getting even better at it. A highly specialized
character is generally far more dangerous in a fight than a character
whose abilities aren’t as tightly focused. So, if your character is already
a good archer, maximize him or her by choosing archery-friendly feats at
every opportunity. Buy the best magical bow you can afford. Improve
your character’s Dexterity score as much as possible. Yes, your charac-
ter will be a bit one-dimensional, but if he or she is part of a balanced
adventuring party, you’re smart to specialize; your versatility lies in the
fact that you are part of a team.
 Covering weaknesses: Make choices that patch holes in your character.
For example, fighters have terrible Will saves. Choose the Iron Will feat
or buy a cloak of resistance to cover that weakness. Wizards are fragile in
melee; choose spells, magic items, or feats that improve your Armor
Class and/or Constitution score, so that your wizard can stand up to
more punishment than normal.
 Increasing versatility: Broaden your horizons by making choices that
provide you with access to a variety of class features. For example, take
advantage of multiclassing (discussed in the “Multiclassing: Maxing Out
Your Choices” section, later in this chapter) to get access to a whole
new list of class features. If you’re playing a spellcaster, choose spells
that have multiple uses. If you’re playing a fighting character, take up a
new feat tree that makes you good at an entirely different set of tactics.
Although all of these are decent strategies for optimizing a character, many
experienced players believe that maximizing strengths is the way to go. Here’s
the reason: When you maximize your character’s strengths, you generally get
to decide when to use them. If you’re playing a fantastic archer, you’re in con-
trol of whether or not you shoot or don’t shoot in any given combat round.
On the other hand, when you cover a weakness, you aren’t able to control
whether or not your efforts will matter. If you build a fighter who is great at
resisting magic, you don’t get much benefit out of an encounter in which your
fighter isn’t threatened by magic.
Exploiting good interactions
The real art of character optimization lies in finding good interactions between
your character’s subsystems. Anybody can make good choices about which
feats to learn, or what equipment to carry, or which spells to keep handy. We’re
going to look at making choices that synergize with each other.
281
Chapter 22: Character Building for Experts

That may sound like a lot of gobbledygook to you, so we provide an example.
Say that you like the Combat Reflexes feat. To get the most out of this feat
choice, you should probably take the spiked chain as your weapon of choice
in order to give your character the extra reach to manufacture opportunities
for the Combat Reflexes feat to work. And, when you consider spells or magic
items that will help this character, take a look at effects that increase your
character’s Dexterity score, such as a cat’s grace spell or gloves of Dexterity.
The higher your character’s Dexterity, the more bonus attacks of opportunity
you get to make using the Combat Reflexes feat. And, if you’re going to have a
great Dexterity score, you should consider the Weapon Finesse feat so that
you can use your character’s Dexterity bonus on attacks with the spiked chain.
So, as you can see, your choices in three distinct game subsystems — feats,
282
Part III: Playing Your Best Games 
Try this at home!
We don’t have enough room in this book to
detail all the possibilities for great character
builds, but here are a few particularly good
combinations you might want to try with your
next character:
 Spiked chain fighter: Start with a good
Dexterity score, and take the feats Exotic
Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Combat
Reflexes, and Weapon Finesse. Raise your
Dexterity through the roof. The extra reach
granted by the spiked chain means that
your character threatens more of the bat-
tlefield, and the more area your character
threatens, the more likely it is foes will give
your character chances for attacks of
opportunity.
 Axe murderer: Start with a good Strength
score, take a level of barbarian, and pick up
the feat Power Attack. Choose a big two-
handed weapon such as a greatsword or
greataxe for your weapon of choice; you
get to add 11⁄2 times your character’s
Strength bonus to damage rolls with a two-
handed weapon. Flying into a barbarian
rage temporarily increases your character’s
Strength by +4, which translates into a +2
attack bonus and +3 damage bonus with a
two-handed weapon. When you use the
Power Attack feat with a two-handed
weapon, you deal +2 damage for every –1
you take on the attack roll. You can deal
huge damage fast with this build.
 Armored wizard: Arcane spellcasters nor-
mally can’t afford to wear heavy armor,
because the chance of spell failure is too
high. But try this: Learn the Still Spell feat,
and then take the Armor Proficiency feat (or
better yet, multiclass and take a level of
fighter). When your character uses the Still
Spell feat, spells no longer have a somatic
(gesture) component, and therefore, you
bypass the chance of spell failure for wear-
ing armor. Another tactic for a sorcerer or
wizard who wears armor is to take the
Scribe Scroll or Craft Wand feats and make
a number of these magic items. Scrolls and
wands get around the armor restriction, too.
If you’re willing to throw your character’s
spells a little less efficiently, there’s no
reason your sorcerer or wizard can’t stomp
around in full plate armor and carry a heavy
shield.

equipment, and spells or magic items — all work together to make this char-
acter far more effective with the Combat Reflexes build than he or she would
be if you made the feat choice in isolation and didn’t follow up with comple-
mentary choices in the other game systems.
Here’s a quick checklist of game systems that you can mesh together to make
your character a true Frankenstein monster of min-maxing:
 Ability scores: Can you find a way to exploit your character’s highest
ability score(s)?
 Character class: Do your character’s ability scores make sense for his or
her class? Is there another class your character’s ability scores make him
or her well suited for? If so, that might be a good class to multiclass into.
 Feat selections: Do your feat selections make use of your character’s
best ability score?
 Equipment choices: Do you have the right armor and weapons for your
character’s ability scores and your choice of character class?
 Spells known: If you’re playing a spellcaster, does your character know
(or prepare) spells that make the best use of his or her key ability score?
 Magic items: Are there magic items that can help your min-maxing strat-
egy? Would a more powerful weapon allow your min-maxing plan to
work better? What about a magic item that improves your character’s
most important ability score?
Multiclassing: Maxing Out Your Choices
Perhaps the single best tool at your disposal for optimizing your character is
multiclassing: Starting your adventuring career as a character of one class, and
then switching over to another class after you gain a level or two. For example,
your character might start out as a 1st-level rogue, which gives you a bunch
of skill points and a little sneak attack right at the start of your career. But
after your character gains a level or two, you might decide you want to get
better at fighting, so when your character reaches the next level, you stop
taking rogue levels and instead start taking fighter levels. Your character
might eventually become a 2nd-level rogue/4th-level fighter, or a 3rd-level
rogue/8th-level fighter, or even something as crazy as a 2nd-level rogue/
4th-level fighter/5th-level ranger.
You’ll find the rules on multiclassing on pages 59–60 of the Player’s Handbook.
283
Chapter 22: Character Building for Experts

There are some downsides to multiclassing. When you decide that you want
your character to become a 3rd-level rogue/1st-level fighter instead of being a
4th-level rogue, you have to give up 4th-level rogue abilities in order to
acquire 1st-level fighter abilities. This is especially painful for characters who
are primarily spellcasters. Very few classes look as good at 1st level as your
wizard’s 5th, 7th, or 9th level looks, because at those levels, your wizard
gains access to new spell levels. You may also paint yourself into a corner by
making it nearly impossible to reach important goals down the road. For
example, if you think the Improved Critical feat is the best feat in the game,
you’ll have a hard time getting it if you take a lot of nonfighter levels, because
Improved Critical requires a base attack bonus of +8. You can buy this feat at
8th level as a straight fighter, but if you multiclass, you’ll need to wait until at
least 9th level, because no other class gets a bonus feat at 8th level.
That said, multiclassing is the min-maxer’s dream. By combining the best
class features from two (or more) classes, you can build extremely powerful
and capable characters. Of course, this takes time — you can’t reach the
good features in two or more classes until your character is at least 5th or
6th level overall. However, you’re generally better off putting most of your
effort into your character’s primary class — the thing you really want to do,
whatever that is — and just dip into another class for a level or two. This kind
of character building is called cherrypicking. For example, if you’re playing a
2nd-level rogue/8th-level fighter, you’ve cherrypicked two levels of rogue, but
you’re mostly a fighter.
Different classes have good breakpoints for cherrypicking, as shown on Table
22-1. The Key Level column indicates just how many levels you’d like to have
of the class to get the best benefit for your cherrypicking.

Choosing a Prestige Class
The pinnacle of multiclassing is taking a prestige class. Prestige classes are
classes that are only available through multiclassing. In fact, prestige classes
have special requirements that your character must meet before you can take
a level in that class. Any character can take a level of fighter or ranger at any
point, but if you want to take a level of dwarven defender, your character needs
to know the feats Dodge, Endurance, and Toughness; have a base attack bonus
of +7; and be a dwarf of lawful alignment. Until all those things are true for
your character, you can’t take a level of the dwarven defender prestige class.
You’ll find prestige classes hidden away in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, begin-
ning on page 176. Most DMs treat these prestige classes as “in play” in their
games — you won’t have to argue with your DM about whether or not your
character can make use of one. Prestige classes are also a major component
of many other D&D supplements.
Table 22-2 provides a quick overview of the prestige classes found in the
Dungeon Master’s Guide and describes the quickest way to make your charac-
ter qualified for the class. Your character will have to meet some specific feat
and skill requirements too — the Quickest Entry column simply tells you
what classes to take in order to breeze through the requirements.
In terms of what specific prestige classes offer, there are a few things you
want to look out for:
 Attack progression: If a prestige class offers full base attack progres-
sion, it’s increasing your base attack bonus (BAB) by +1 per level. That’s
good for characters who want to indulge in physical combat.
 Spellcasting progression: If a prestige class offers full spellcasting pro-
gression, it allows your character to cast spells as if you had kept on
287
Chapter 22: Character Building for Experts

advancing as a cleric, or wizard, or whatever your character used to be.
That’s critically important for players who want their characters to
remain good spellcasters. 
 Sneak attack progression: If a prestige class offers sneak attack progres-
sion, it makes your character better at sneak attack as you take levels.
This is useful for anybody, but especially good for rogues who don’t
want to miss out on big sneak attacks.
 Special abilities: Many prestige classes offer a variety of interesting or
powerful special abilities. Sometimes it’s worth trading off some base
attack or spellcasting progression in order to get the prestige class’s
special abilities. You’ll have to decide that on a case-by-case basis.

The Art of Dungeon
Mastering

In this part . . .
T
he single most important factor in a successful D&D
game is the Dungeon Master. Every player gets to con-
centrate on playing one character at a time and exploring
the fantastic world around his or her character, but the DM
plays a cast of thousands and in fact creates the world that
the other players explore. Being a DM is like being a novel-
ist whose characters are completely out of his control —
because you don’t know what the heroes of the story are
going to do and how they’re going to interact with the
adventure and the game world, you’re just as surprised by
the shape of unfolding events as the players are. With a
good DM, the D&D game is filled with excitement, wonder,
intrigue, humor, suspense, and unforgettable moments
players will talk about for years afterwards.

 Running monsters in combat
T
he first and most important ingredient of a DUNGEON & DRAGONS game is a
good Dungeon Master. The DM serves as referee, judge, storyteller, sup-
porting cast, scenery builder, villain creator, monster player, and dungeon
crafter. Without the DM’s efforts, all the other players are left with interesting
characters but nothing to do with them. We can’t stress this one enough: You
need a DM to run the D&D game, and the better your Dungeon Master, the
better the game is going to be.
Ideally, you should learn how to be a DM by observing an experienced and
talented Dungeon Master work his or her magic — preferably by playing in
that DM’s game. However, we can’t always promise that you will be able to
start your D&D gaming experience by landing in the hands of a talented DM.
If you and your friends are all pretty new at the game, someone at the table
will have to step up and do the DM’s job, and it might as well be you.
Although it’s challenging to be the DM, and it takes some extra time and
preparation, you’ll also find that it can be very rewarding. When you realize
that everyone else at the table is going to remember your dungeon for years
afterwards, reliving their characters’ triumphs (and failures) over and over
again, you’ll understand what we’re talking about.
In this chapter, we discuss the basics of being a Dungeon Master. We tell you
all about the role of the Dungeon Master in running the D&D game, and we
show you how to administer the game with fairness, consistency, and an eye
for dramatic tension. Before you know it, you’ll be one of those great DMs
that other folks hope to learn from.

DMing: The Best Job in the Game
If you’re new to the game, you’re probably wondering what in the world a
Dungeon Master does. There isn’t really a short answer to that question. As
DM, you run the game. You narrate the story of the player characters. You
play the monsters. You build the world. You design the dungeons. You hand
out the treasure. You play the villains, and you give the other players in the
game the opportunity to feel great about beating evil into paste with a
broadsword or a lightning bolt. You’re the director of this movie, and you’re
the guy or gal who’s going to put people at the edge of their seats time and
time again.
Because “You do everything,” isn’t a particularly helpful answer, in the follow-
ing sections, we break down the big parts of the job and discuss them at
more length.
Preparing an adventure
Are the heroes pillaging the long-lost Crypt of Azar-Malzz? Defending the
town of Pommeville from a plague of werewolves? Stomping out the cult of
Elemental Evil? Searching the depths of an old dwarven stronghold? When
you’re the DM, you decide what challenge the heroes are facing. You pick the
monsters they’ll fight, and you decide the stakes.
Preparing an adventure takes some extra work, usually between game ses-
sions. You need to design your own adventure or pick up a published adven-
ture from your hobby store (see the section, “Choosing an Adventure to
Run,” later in this chapter). You should read ahead so that you know what
four or five encounters or situations the heroes are most likely going to
encounter in each game session, and be ready to run those encounters on
game night.
Building the world
So what’s outside of the dungeon? Is there a spider-infested forest surround-
ing the place? Is there a town nearby? Who lives there? What sort of adven-
tures can they point the player characters toward? What lies over the next
range of hills? Who built that ruined castle, and who or what lives there now?
Running a D&D game gives you a perfect excuse to indulge yourself in the fine
art of world building. You get to craft an entire kingdom for the players to
explore when they decide to take a break from plundering whatever dungeon
you put in front of them to start with. Sometimes you simply use your world
building to provide your dungeons and monsters with a place to live. Other
294
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

times, you’re weaving an intricate and living setting to serve as the backdrop
for the heroes’ story. Whatever the case may be, your players expect you to
know (or expertly make up on the fly) countless answers about what their
characters see around them as they travel through the world.
You don’t need to start by building a whole world at once; some of the best
campaigns begin as tiny kernels, nothing more than a dungeon and a nearby
town that the players shuttle back and forth between. Start small and answer
the questions one at a time as they come up.
Playing NPCs
As a DM, anytime the player characters interact with another person or intel-
ligent monster (also known as an NPC, or nonplayer character), you speak for
that being. Many DMs feel that this is the most fun part of the job; you get
to try out all kinds of parts, including power-mad dark overlords delivering
villainous monologues, stammering stable boys, gruff innkeepers, shifty infor-
mants, imperious wizards, absent-minded sages, sinister dragons chatting
with the heroes they expect to be their next meal, regal elf lords too proud to
ask for help, or slow-witted ettins who take turns speaking with each head.
The world is full of people and monsters for the heroes to talk to, and it’s
your job to figure out what they’re going to say and deliver their lines.
Sometimes, this is pretty easy. When you’re starting an adventure by having a
mysterious wizard hire the party to accomplish a specific task, you’ve got a
fair idea of what the wizard wants, how he’s going to pay the party, and what
he’s willing to tell them about the perils they’ll face on their mission. On the
other hand, players (as their characters) sometimes strike up random con-
versations with people you never expected to have to know anything about.
When the players ask the captain of the lord’s guard if he likes working for
Baron Duncastle, well, you’ve got to decide what the answer to that question
is, whether or not the guard captain feels like sharing it, and how he’ll do so.

Chapter 23: Running the Game
Using a published campaign setting
A number of professionally designed campaign
settings are available in your friendly local gaming
store. A published campaign setting is a ready-to-
use world for your D&D game, usually filled with
countless ideas for adventures just waiting for 
you to bring to life. Two good options you’ll find 
out there right now are the FORGOTTEN REALMS
Campaign Setting and the Eberron Campaign
Setting, both published by Wizards of the Coast,
Inc. Whether you prefer to build your own world or
use someone else’s is up to you, of course. But
even if you decide to create your own campaign,
you can find lots of cool and interesting elements
to borrow from in a published setting.

Running monsters
Playing monsters is the other part of the job most DMs love. When the player
characters get into a scrap with a ferocious monster or an evil villain, you run
the bad guys in the fight. You decide what they’re going to do — which of the
heroes they attack, what tactics they use, and when they give up and surrender
or run away. You roll their attack and damage rolls, make their saving throws,
and keep track of their hit points (or any other damage they’re taking).
Your goal when you run the bad guys in the fight is not necessarily to find the
most efficient way to slaughter the player characters. You’re trying to chal-
lenge the players and help to build a riveting and suspenseful story. You want
each fight to feel distinctive and memorable, and you want to run the monsters
and villains as intelligently (or unintelligently) as they really would fight. The
key ideas are excitement, suspense, and believability — not just running up the
body count.
Adjudicating results
Most of the time, the game rules are clear. This is especially true with attacks,
spells, and physical skill uses like Balance, Climb, or Tumble. But part of the
fun of a roleplaying game like D&D is that a player can have his or her charac-
ter try anything he or she can think of — and a fair number of those sponta-
neous actions are things that the rules don’t cover. The DM’s got to make a
call on the fly to decide whether these unusual actions succeed or fail.
For example, the heroes are fighting in an evil temple when one of the players
tells you that his character Krusk is going to kick over a brazier full of glow-
ing red coals so that it’ll singe the skeleton he’s fighting and kick up hot
embers in its face. Sorry to say it, but there aren’t any rules in the game for
exactly what it takes to kick over a heavy, solid metal brazier and make the
coals fly in the right direction. But it’s a heroic move that sure sounds cool,
so you want to reward your player for thinking outside the box. You’ll have to
decide what kind of roll Krusk ought to make, how much damage hot coals
do, and whether the skeleton is even bothered by a face full of embers. (Off
the cuff, we’d say have Krusk make a DC 15 Strength check, the skeleton
takes 1d6 fire damage from the coals, and no, it doesn’t care about embers in
its face. But we’re ruling on the fly, too.)
Keeping up with the characters
Last but not least, a good DM stays involved with each one of the players’
characters. In a perfect world, you’ll eventually get around to showcasing
every character in an adventure that’s tailored to that character’s strengths,
personality, and backstory. If your buddy Joe is playing Torvald, the paladin
296
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

who’s secretly an exiled prince of the kingdom of Erewhon, sooner or later it
would be great to create an adventure that pits Torvald against the evil baron
who arranged for his exile — and who now has his eyes on Erewhon’s throne.
You can’t do that with every adventure, but it’s a fine idea to run something
“personalized” for your players once in every two to three adventures, spot-
lighting a different character each time you do it.
On the nuts-and-bolts side, you’ll also want to keep up with the player char-
acters’ abilities and gear. It’s important for you to know just how tough the
player characters really are, whether they’re ahead of the curve or behind the
curve on arming themselves with great magic items, and what sort of feats
and spells they have at their disposal. Specifically, you should be aware of
which prestige classes your players are angling for and what their characters
are going to need to get into those classes. Helping your players to realize
characters that are cool, powerful, and distinctive is one of the real pleasures
of DMing.
Choosing an Adventure to Run
Your first challenge as a new Dungeon Master is to figure out what kind of
adventure you’re going to serve up to the players. You’ve got two basic
options:
 Designing your own adventure: We cover this extensively in Chapter 24
of this book. Basically, you collect a suitable array of monsters and chal-
lenges and create a good plot or story to involve the players. When you
design your own adventure, you have the advantage of knowing exactly
what your players are like and what characters they’re going to bring to
the game.
 Using a published adventure: With a little looking around, you can find
literally hundreds of adventures published by various game companies.
Check out your local hobby store or bookstore for starters. Dungeon
Magazine is an outstanding resource that prints four or five great adven-
tures every month. You can also find adventures online (check www.
wizards.com), or locales suitable for developing into adventures in
many roleplaying game supplements. This definitely saves you time and
effort, but no game designer can know exactly how your gaming group
works or what sorts of things your players are interested in doing.
When writing your own adventure or choosing a published adventure to run
for your friends, keep your adventuring party’s character level and class mix
in mind. Ideally, most of the combat encounters in the adventure should have
an Encounter Level equivalent to your party’s average character level. Check
out “Encounters” on page 48 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Chapter 23: Running the Game

Task-Oriented DMing
As with many things, the best way to learn how to be a Dungeon Master is to
just try it. Through trial and error, you’ll eventually get the hang of what a
Dungeon Master needs to do to make a game run. There’s nothing like jumping
in at the deep end, after all . . . but if you find this prospect a little intimidating,
then read on. As best we can, we try to reduce the DM’s job to a set of
processes that we call task-oriented DMing.
Here’s the theory: Most game play takes place in one of five basic tasks —
talking, exploring, fighting, setting up, or free time. What you need to do as 
a novice DM is identify what kind of task you’re currently engaged in, and
follow the appropriate process. Table 23-1 describes each of the basic tasks.

guys?”
It’s not always going to be clear what task you’re in at the moment. In fact, it’s
possible for one group to be engaged in multiple tasks at the same time. For
example, if the heroes just won a fierce fight against a band of savage lizard-
folk warriors, you might have the rogue searching the chamber for hidden
treasure, the cleric busily healing up the fighter with cure wounds spells, and
the sorcerer quietly questioning the two villagers the heroes just rescued
from the clutches of the cruel lizardfolk.
Here’s a quick primer on prioritizing tasks:
 Free time ends as soon as you have something else to do: Free time is
usually “time out” from one of the other tasks. For example, if the party
is exploring a cave system and winds up having a discussion about
299
Chapter 23: Running the Game

which way to go and how to use their magic to move safely and stealth-
ily, you’ve put the exploration job on hold for a few minutes. There’s
nothing wrong with that; as soon as the players reach a decision, just
pick up with the exploring again. 
 Set up is a lot like free time: It also ends as soon as you have something
else to do. Usually, you’ll go from set up into exploration.
 Exploration is the default condition: If you’re done with setting up but
you haven’t yet hit an obstacle or encounter of some kind, you’re in
exploration. Usually, PCs explore until they hit an obstacle to deal with
(see the following section, “The exploration tasks”), a character to talk
to, or a monster to fight.
 Talking trumps exploration: When you meet someone or something in
the game, it’s called an encounter. Many encounters take you straight to
a fight, but some offer the possibility of talking in place of fighting. If
there’s a conversation going on, resolve that first before you move on to
any other tasks. Of course, fights sometimes break out in the middle of
conversations. When you finish your conversation, you go back to explo-
ration mode.
 Combat trumps everything else: If there’s a fight going on, everything
else can wait. The fight continues until one side or the other runs away,
surrenders, or dies (or is otherwise defeated). When the fight is finished,
you usually will default back to exploration again.
The exploration task
Exploration is the default state of the game. When you’re exploring, you’re
soliciting from the players some decision or direction about which way
they’re going and what they’re looking for. Then you resolve that decision
and continue until the heroes come to an obstacle, meet with an encounter of
some kind, or reach another decision point. As a general rule, when running
the activity of exploring, a DM follows these steps: 
1. Describe the options.
Tell the players what paths are available for their characters. For example:
“The rubble-choked stairwell descends into a dusty old vault beneath 
the ruined monastery. There’s a large, dark well shaft in one corner of the
room with a low stone wall around it, a passage leading off toward the
east, and an old wooden door in the north wall. What do you do?”
2. Get the players to tell you what their characters are doing.
Sometimes this might be a group action — “We’ll take the passage to the
east,” — or sometimes this may be an individual action, such as, “I’m
going to search the door for traps.”
300
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

3. Identify player responses.
Identify the action the player character is attempting to perform. Don’t
be afraid to ask your player to be more specific or helpful. If she tells
you something like, “I’ll go search the old well,” you can ask, “Are you
just leaning over the well to look down? Are you searching around the
stone rim? Or are you going to climb down in there?”
If you’re not sure how to resolve what the player character is trying to
do, try the following:
• Is she trying to use a specific skill such as Disable, Open Lock, or
Decipher Script?
• Is he trying to shove or move something? (A Strength check may
be in order.)
• Is she just looking around? (A Spot check may be in order, if there’s
anything to see.)
• Is he seriously examining something? (A Search check may be in
order.)
• Is she trying to move on, in, or through something? (Balance,
Climb, Jump, or Escape Artist skill checks may be in order.)
4. Interrupt with obstacles or encounters.
If the player characters meet up with an obstacle, trap, or creature of
some kind, interrupt the exploration and either tell the players what
obstacle the characters have met with, resolve the trap, or move to a
talking encounter or fighting encounter, as appropriate.
Some examples of this sort of interruption include:
• “The door’s stuck. It won’t open. If you want to try to force it open,
you’ll have to make a Strength check.”
• “The inside of that well is smooth and slippery. You’ve got to make
a DC 20 Climb check to descend safely.”
• “When you step into the east passage, you hear a click and feel a
pressure plate depress slightly under your foot, and then a hidden
device shoots a steel dart at you! What’s your flatfooted AC?” (You
then roll to see if the trap hits and if so, how much damage it does.)
• “You hear a grinding, rumbling sound from the wall behind you,
and suddenly a hulking bug-eyed monster the size of an ogre
bursts through the wall and attacks! Roll initiative everybody!”
5. Advance to the next decision point.
Assuming that nothing jumps out and tries to kill the heroes, you can
move to the next place where they need to make a decision. If the heroes
follow a ten-mile long trail through the forest to the old ruins, and nothing
301
Chapter 23: Running the Game

in particular happens during that hike, you can just say, “You hike for
about five hours, and then you reach a dark and dismal hollow in the
middle of the forest, where an old broken tower stands in the gloom.”
The conversation task
Many of the most important challenges in the D&D game don’t involve any
combat at all. Player characters can talk to anything they meet (especially
after they get their hands on the speak with animals spell). Sometimes con-
versation is clearly not going to help; dungeons are full of big, hungry, stupid
monsters who want nothing more than to eat anybody they meet, and can’t
or won’t introduce themselves properly first. And other times, conversation
is possible, but it just won’t go anywhere; not every castle guard or innkeeper
knows something that the players can use in their current adventure (or any
adventure at all, for that matter).
Conversations in the game tend to fall into three categories: Avoiding fights,
gathering information, and asking for help. As a general rule, when running
conversation scenarios, a DM follows these steps:
1. Describe the scene and the NPC.
Tell the players who or what their characters have met, what that
person or monster looks like, and what he or she is doing.
2. Decide what the NPC wants.
If you don’t know already, take a moment and consider what this NPC
wants to get from the player characters in the conversation that’s
coming up. It might be as simple as, “I want these people to go away and
leave me alone.” It might be more complicated: “I don’t want anything in
particular, but if they drop a bag of gold in my lap, I’d try hard to be
helpful.” It might be downright devious: “I want these people to go off to
Grimdeath Keep and tell me when they’re going, so that I can tell my evil
master when to ambush them.” 
3. Give an opening line.
A good way to signal that this is going to be a talking encounter is to
have the NPC or monster speak first. Figure out what this NPC will say,
how he, she, or it will say it, and then deliver your opening line. For
example: “The ogre standing in the middle of the road squints at you and
scratches his chin. ‘This is Og’s road!’ He growls. ‘But you give Og some
gold, and Og be happy to let you use it.’”
Don’t be afraid to ham it up. Chances are you’re not a professional actor,
but who cares? Let it all out when you’re speaking for your monsters
and NPCs. You want the players to remember this person or monster and
this conversation later, or you wouldn’t be having a talking encounter
now, would you?
302
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

4. Pursue the conversation.
Let the players respond to your opening line (or have your monster or
NPC respond to theirs), and then continue the conversation as long as
necessary. If you need to, take a minute or two to think it over, and let
the players know that you’re trying to figure out what the NPC or mon-
ster says next.
5. Say goodbye and hang up.
When the conversation’s over, make sure you let the players know that
this monster or NPC is done talking and that you consider the conversa-
tion to be at an end. For example, say something like, “Og counts the
coins you gave him, which seems sort of hard for him. Then the ogre
grins with a mouth full of crooked fangs and says, ‘Have good trip on
Og’s road!’”
The combat task
Running a fight can be pretty complex, but here’s the good news — there’s
little doubt about whether or not you’re in a fight scene. If the player charac-
ters are trying to kill someone or something, or vice versa, your job is clear:
You’ve got to get the battle resolved before anything else happens.
Here’s the basic process for running the combat task:
1. Fix everyone’s position.
Figure out where the heroes and monsters are standing at the beginning of
the hostile encounter. In a dungeon, this is pretty clear: If the heroes bust
open the door to Room 7, the Armory, any monsters that your adventure
notes as occupying Room 7 will be inside the room. If you don’t know
exactly where the monsters are in the room, take your best guess.
If the battle is not in a dungeon, you may have to be more creative. In a
wilderness setting, you’ll want to determine the encounter distance
based on how far away the heroes and the monsters are likely to spot
each other. Refer to the terrain descriptions on pages 87–93 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide.
2. Is this an ambush?
If there’s a chance that one side isn’t aware of the other side when the
encounter begins, figure out who sees who first by making Spot or Listen
checks for the monsters and having players make Spot or Listen checks
for their characters. See the “Starting an Encounter” section on page 22
of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
There are four basic scenarios that you want to consider when deciding
who might be ambushing who:
303
Chapter 23: Running the Game

• Heroes storm the room: The PCs kick open a dungeon door and
leap in, swords bared. Usually, no one should be surprised; the bad
guys might be startled by the sudden appearance of the heroes,
but the heroes don’t know for sure that there’s someone to fight in
the room. Skip the surprise round and go to initiative. 
• Monster jumps out: A monster is watching some place a hero
might walk into or through, and leaps out to attack as soon as the
hero appears. The monster is aware of the hero, but the hero might
not see the monster before it attacks. Usually, it’s fair to have the
monster make a Hide check (maybe with a big bonus, if it’s got a
great place to lurk), and then allow the character under attack to
make a Spot check to see the monster before it springs. If the char-
acter spots the monster, he or she is aware of it in the surprise
round, so he or she can act. If the character doesn’t spot the mon-
ster, the monster surprises him or her.
• Heroes sneak up on the monster: The heroes have a good idea
that there’s a monster someplace up ahead, and they try to take it
by surprise. The heroes are aware of the monster, but the monster
may not be aware of the heroes. Usually, you’ll have the heroes
doing the sneaking try their stealth skills (Move Silently, or possi-
bly Hide) or use stealthy magic (like the invisibility or silence
spells) to get close. The bad guys get the opportunity to make Spot
or Listen checks to detect the heroes; if they fail, they’re surprised.
Otherwise, roll initiative normally.
• Chance meeting: The heroes and monsters blunder into each other.
Maybe the heroes are walking along a forest trail when they meet a
dire wolf out hunting, or maybe they’re confronting a gang of ruffi-
ans in a bad part of town when someone draws a blade. Whatever
the case, neither side has any special advantage over the other; the
best thing to do is to just roll initiative and start the fight. 
3. Set out the battle grid.
Draw out the terrain or room outline on the battle mat, with one square
on the mat equal to a 5-foot square on your map. Then place the figures
or markers for the characters and the monsters in their appropriate posi-
tions. This will help players figure out where they can and can’t move. 
4. Roll initiative.
Everybody on both sides of the fight rolls initiative to determine the ini-
tiative order for the fight. (However, surprised characters or monsters
won’t get to act in the surprise round.) 
5. Surprise round.
If only some of the monsters or heroes can act, they get to do so now.
Only those characters or monsters who are aware of the enemy get to
act in this round. They only get one standard action each. See the sec-
tion, “The Surprise Round,” on page 23 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
304
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

6. First round.
Now start resolving combat rounds:
A. Count down the initiative order. Beginning with the highest initia-
tive roll, resolve each character or monster’s action for the round. 
B. Monsters and villains act. When you reach a monster or villain
(some bad guy you’re running, because you’re the DM) decide
what that bad guy is going to do this round. Resolve the action. See
the section called, “Getting the Most out of Your Monsters,” later in
this chapter, for advice on running monsters in combat.
C. The heroes act. When you reach a player-controlled character in
the initiative order, tell the player that it’s his or her turn and ask
him or her what the character is going to do. Resolve whatever
action the player character attempts.
D. Finish the round. When everyone has acted, you’ve finished the
round. This is a good place to pause and take stock of what’s going
on. Are there other monsters nearby that might hear the fight and
come to investigate? Do the monsters decide to break off the battle
and run for it? (They’ll have to wait for their next action to begin
running, of course.)
7. Go to the next round.
After you reach the end of the initiative order in the first round, the
round’s over. Go back up to Step 6 and begin the second round.
A combat encounter lasts until one side or the other is dead, runs away, sur-
renders, or manages to call a truce. 
The free time task
You’ll find that you begin most adventure sessions and most new adventures
with some DMing that isn’t really “on the clock.” For example, if you know
that the players are about to go explore the Caves of Doom, you’ll usually
provide a little information about why their heroes are interested and how
they got there. At a bare minimum, you ought to say something like, “You’ve
heard of a great treasure hidden somewhere in the monster-haunted Caves of
Doom, so you’ve hiked into the Dragonbone Hills. You’re now standing in
front of a gaping cave mouth in the side of a hill. Any special preparations
before you go in?” (That’s an extremely minimal set up, but most players will
cut a new DM some slack and go along for now.)
Free time is also good for evaluating options and attending to tasks that take
time, but don’t need DMing. For example, if the heroes are going to rest up for
a week in town, the player running the wizard might look at you and say,
“While we’re waiting, I’m going to scribe a couple of scrolls.” You don’t need
305
Chapter 23: Running the Game

to run through any real process for this. Just assess the cost and have the
player pay up the gold pieces and XP that the character needs to make some
scrolls. Similarly, debating the question of which way to turn next in an
adventure, or what adventure to set off on, is also a good free time task.
Finally, even in the tightest-run games, there’s a lot of screwing around.
People sitting around the table will drop out of game mode and chat about
movies they’ve seen, how things are going at work, or memorable scenes
from old games. As DM, you’re not in charge of all this. We only mention it
because it’s important for you to recognize free time when your players
happen to stumble into it. Clam up for a few minutes, let your players gab or
joke, make a trip to the bathroom or whatever, and then get back into the
game when you think your players are ready.
Getting the Most out of Your Monsters
One of your most important jobs as DM is to run the monsters and bad guys
in a fight. The first thing you need to do to run a monster in a fight is to learn
where to find key information about the monster — getting a handle on the
format in which monsters and villains are normally presented. When you
know how to navigate a monster description or stat block, you’ll want to
learn how to make decisions for the monsters that make sense and suit the
situation, without cutting the players too much of a break or being too tough
on them.
Figuring out monster stats
Monsters have many of the same critical numbers that characters do.
They’ve got hit points, Armor Class, attack bonuses, saving throws, skills and
feats, even ability scores. 
In most D&D supplements or adventures, monsters are presented in one of
two basic formats: the Monster Manual entry, or the stat block. In order to run
a monster in combat, you’ll need to have an idea of how these two formats
tell you crucial information about the monster or villain in question.
Take a look at the nearby sidebar, “Gargoyle (Monster Manual),” which shows
the Monster Manual entry for the gargoyle.
You’ll find the key for reading the Monster Manual entry on pages 5–7 of the
Monster Manual. But just to help you out, here’s a quick look at some of the
more important pieces of information hidden in this format:
306
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Medium: The gargoyle’s size. Most monsters range from Tiny to Huge. A
monster’s size influences several other stats.
 Monstrous Humanoid (Earth): The monster’s type and subtype. A mon-
ster type is sort of like a character class — it dictates the type of Hit
Dice, attack bonus, and saves the monster gets.

Space/Reach: 5 ft./5 ft.
Special Attacks: — 
Special Qualities: Damage reduction 10/magic, darkvision 60 ft., freeze
Saves: Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +4
Abilities: Str 15, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 7
Skills: Hide +7*, Listen +4, Spot +4
Feats: Multiattack, Toughness
Environment: Any
Organization: Solitary, pair, or wing (5–16)
Challenge Rating: 4
Treasure: Standard
Alignment: Usually chaotic evil
Advancement: 5–6 HD (Medium), 7–12 HD (Large)
Level Adjustment: +5
Freeze (Ex): A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. An observer must succeed
on a DC 20 Spot check to notice the gargoyle is really alive.
*The Hide bonus increases by +8 when a gargoyle is concealed against a background of stone.

 Hit Dice: The number of Hit Dice the monster has, plus its bonus hit
points based on its Constitution bonus and any feats like Toughness. Hit
Dice are very much like a monster’s level.
 (37 hp): The number of hit points an average gargoyle has.
 Initiative: The gargoyle’s modifier for initiative rolls.
 Speed: The gargoyle’s speed in one move action. If it charges or takes a
double move, it can go twice this distance in one round.
 Fly 60 ft. (average): Gargoyles can fly. If the gargoyle stays on the ground,
its speed is 40 feet. If it takes to the air, its speed is 60 feet, and its maneu-
verability is average. Maneuverability only matters if you’re using the tac-
tical aerial movement rules (they’re on page 20 of the DMG).
 Armor Class: The gargoyle’s AC. The touch AC is helpful information for
spells (many use a touch attack, not a melee or ranged attack). The flat-
footed AC is the gargoyle’s AC when it can’t use its Dex bonus.
 Base Attack/Grapple: Two numbers you won’t use very often. Base
attack is really only useful for a few monsters that have feats such as
Combat Expertise. Grapple is more common; many monsters try to grab
the heroes. Gargoyles aren’t particularly inclined to grapple, but if a
wrestling match breaks out in the middle of a gargoyle battle, its grapple
modifier is +6.
 Attack: When the gargoyle can make only one attack (usually because it
moved and attacked in the same round), this is its attack. The “+6
melee” tells you that it makes a melee attack with both claws with a +6
bonus (1d20+6), and the value in parenthesis tells you how much
damage it deals if it hits (in this case, 1d4+2).
 Full Attack: When the gargoyle can use the full attack action (usually
because it happened to begin its turn within five feet of a character it
wanted to attack) it makes claw, bite, and gore attacks in a single round.
 Space: How much territory the gargoyle takes up on the battle map. In
this case, it’s just one 5-foot square.
 Reach: How far away the gargoyle can hit someone with its attack. This
means it has to be in a square right next to the hero it wants to attack.
 Special Qualities: Any special abilities the gargoyle has are noted here.
Damage reduction is a big one; this means that the gargoyle ignores the
first 10 points of damage any opponent does with a physical attack,
unless the opponent is wielding a magical weapon.
 Saves: The gargoyle’s save modifiers for Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves.
 Abilities: The gargoyle’s ability scores.
 Skills: The gargoyle’s skill modifiers. Monsters get skill points and spend
them just like PCs do; if a skill isn’t listed here, you can assume that the
gargoyle has 0 ranks in it.
308
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Feats: The feats the gargoyle knows. (Multiattack is a feat from the
Monster Manual.)
 Environment: The types of places you find gargoyles. Most monsters’
habitats are a lot more specific, such as “cold forests” or “temperate hills.”
 Organization: The number of gargoyles you’re likely to run into at one
time.
 Challenge Rating: The CR of a typical gargoyle. The DM uses this to
determine if a monster is a good match for the party of player charac-
ters and to determine how many XP the players earn for beating that
monster.
 Advancement: Don’t worry about this. It’s just a guideline for how you
can customize a gargoyle if you want to make a super-tough one.
 Level Adjustment: If somebody wanted to play a gargoyle as a player
character, you’d use its level adjustment to determine how to balance
that against normal character race choices. Don’t worry about it now.
See the nearby sidebar, “Gargoyle (stat block),” to take a look at how that
same monster looks when you change it from the monster entry format to
the stat block format.
A stat block may look pretty intimidating at first glance, but it’s not as bad as
it seems. Every abbreviation in the stat block format mirrors a line from the
Monster Manual entry format. For example, “HD” stands for Hit Dice, “AC”
stands for Armor Class, and “Grp” stands for Grapple. It’s just a denser way of
providing the same information.
Statistics blocks are discussed at length on page 85–86 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.

Deciding what the bad guys do
After you’ve looked up a monster in the Monster Manual or created an evil
NPC and you know what that monster or villain can do, it’s natural to ask
what it will do. Many monsters or villains are pretty complicated; they’ve got
a list of attacks and special abilities as long as your arm. So how in the world
do you figure out which of these abilities the monster is going to use in any
particular round?
Any monster or villain should consider taking one of four basic actions each
round. Not all monsters will be able to use all four choices; for example, an
ogre doesn’t command any magic or have any special attacks. Just ignore the
choices that don’t apply. The four basic choices for a monster’s or villain’s
action in a given round are as follows:
 Hit something: If the monster or villain is standing next to one of the
heroes, it can make a melee attack. Use the monster’s melee attack,
whatever that may be; you’ll roll a d20, add the attack bonus, and see if
you equaled or beat the player’s AC. (If the monster has a good ranged
attack — for example, a goblin with a crossbow — it can attack at range,
of course.)
310
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Move: If the monster isn’t standing next to one of the heroes, but needs
to get next to a hero in order to use its melee attack, it probably ought to
move and get into fighting range. A monster can move up to its speed
and make a single attack in the same round. Or the monster can move
up to twice its speed and make a single attack by taking a charge action
(see page 154 in the Player’s Handbook).
 Use magic: If the monster or villain can cast spells or has spell-like abili-
ties, it can use one of its spells instead of making a melee or ranged
attack. Use your discretion — if the monster has a great melee attack
and only has a couple of low-level “fluff” spell-like abilities (say, some-
thing like detect magic or burning hands), the monster probably prefers
to make melee attacks. But a powerful evil wizard will certainly use his
magic every round that he or she can.
 Make a special attack: Finally, many creatures have special attacks like
breath weapons, gaze attacks, sonic attacks, and so on. If a monster has
a special ability, you should probably use it. What’s the point of pitting
the PCs against a medusa if you don’t use its petrifying gaze?
Fighting smart, fighting dumb
Say you’ve got a half-fiend red dragon attacking the players. It’s got a fiery
breath weapon, awesome melee attacks, nasty evil spell-like abilities, and —
oh yeah — it also casts a bunch of sorcerer spells, too. Which of its attacks
will it use on its next round, and which character will be ground zero for all
this dragon beat-down?
The first thing you want to do is take a look at your monster’s Intelligence
score. Is it a voracious, mindless brute like a huge monstrous centipede? If
so, the most realistic thing for that monster to do is simply move toward the
nearest character and try to eat him or her. That’s what big, dumb bugs
would do. Is it a clever and malicious opponent like a demon or devil? If that’s
the case, it fights with cunning and cruelty, switching easily from attack to
defense and using patience and guile if necessary.
Here’s some guidance on making your tactical decisions when you’re running
a monster or villain:
 Intelligent foes plan, but dumb foes react: A hobgoblin blademaster
knows that the heroes’ cleric can heal up the good guys as fast as the
blademaster can carve them up, or worse yet, get off a lucky hold person
spell, so he’ll go after the cleric with a vengeance. A giant wolf is much
more likely to whirl and snap at the last character who hurt it.
311
Chapter 23: Running the Game

 Lead with your best: Most monsters don’t save their best attack for last.
An evil wizard doesn’t go through a battle throwing 1st-level spells when
he or she has higher-level spells to use. The game assumes that monsters
use their best attacks; that’s why they’re assigned the Challenge Rating
they’ve got.
 Rolling to pick a target: If you honestly don’t know which character a
monster is more likely to attack, there’s nothing wrong with deciding 
the monster will randomly pick which PC to attack — simply roll a d6
and call evens for Joe the Fighter and odds for Bob the Cleric.

Chapter 24
Building a Dungeon
In This Chapter
 Exploring adventure creation
 Using a sample dungeon
I
n the previous chapter, we examined the Dungeon Master’s role in running
a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. The game requires adventures, the framework
through which players work together to create memorable tales of fantasy
and adventure. An adventure can be an epic tale that spans multiple loca-
tions, but at its heart, an adventure focuses on the dungeon.
In this chapter, we examine the basics of adventure creation. We look at cre-
ating encounters, which are the building blocks of adventures. In the end, we
get to the roots of D&D and provide you with a classic dungeon crawl to get
you started.
Finally, we briefly examine the concept of the ongoing D&D campaign and
how you can build a simple campaign by linking adventures in a series or an
intricate campaign to rival anything ever published.
Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide goes into greater depth on creating
D&D adventures. Use the material here as a guide and to see one way to con-
struct an adventure, and then go to the core rulebooks for more details and
advice.
Creating a D&D Adventure
The player who takes on the role of the Dungeon Master has a wealth of cool
and intriguing ideas to share with others. We might not all have the discipline
to write epic novels or the talent to paint vast vistas from our imaginations, but
we can all find an outlet for creative expression and great fun as a Dungeon
Master for a D&D game.

Bear in mind that when you create a D&D adventure, you don’t have to fill in all
the holes or connect all the dots. After all, the DM provides just one part of the
adventure — the players provide the rest through the actions of their charac-
ters. The DM sets up the basic plot and structure of the adventure, but he or
she doesn’t come up with any of the conclusions. How does a specific scene
end? Do the bad guys get defeated? Unlike writing a story, where the writer
determines not only the beginning of the tale but the middle and the end, the
DM just sets the scene. What happens is determined by how the player charac-
ters react and how the dice fall.
This leads to one of the great enjoyments of the game — surprise. The DM
might know what monsters and scenes the adventure includes, but he or she
doesn’t know how things will turn out. The twists and turns of adventures are
often as surprising to the DM as they are to the players.
Parts of an adventure
Adventure creation may seem like a daunting task. The best way to approach
it is by examining the individual parts of an adventure. An adventure (some-
times called a quest or a module, which goes back to the days when the indus-
try referred to published adventures as modules) is a collection of related
encounters that offer a rudimentary storyline. An adventure promises a
story, offers challenges that allow each player character to shine, and pro-
vides opportunities for action and roleplaying.
The DM needs to think in terms of beginnings, scenes, and situations that
kick off action and offer players choices of behavior. “What does your charac-
ter do now?” is a question DMs often ask players. Don’t think in terms of end-
ings, because you want your adventure to reach a conclusion through the
actions and ideas of the players and their characters.
The premise
An adventure starts with a premise, a hook that catches the players’ interests
and involves their characters in some motivation-inducing manner. Think in
terms of set up and build from there. The player characters can get involved
in the premise, but they need a motivation to carry on. More than one moti-
vation might suggest itself, and different PCs can have different motivations
that drive them to take on an adventure. Character motivations include
greed, fear, revenge, morality, curiosity, and need. Player motivation boils
down to seeking to gain experience to improve a character and to having fun
playing the game.
Here are some examples of an adventure premise:
 A hostile kobold tribe has claimed the abandoned manor and is using it
as a staging area for raids on defenseless travelers using the nearby
trade road.
314
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 A scholar of ancient lore needs a group of brave adventurers to explore
the haunted graveyard and find the tomb of Eldrup the Insane.
 A gang of orcs has taken Oleem, the beloved pet cat of the village elder’s
youngest daughter.
You can imagine how any of these premises can be turned into an adventure.
You just need to sketch out a number of related encounters, populate them
with monsters and other obstacles, and draw a map.
Encounters
Encounters are where the action and drama of every adventure take place.
Every encounter is kind of like a miniature, concentrated version of the entire
adventure. An encounter has a hook and a set up. It has a location. It has a
goal that, when attained, ends the encounter and pushes the characters
deeper into the adventure.
Encounter goals usually can be summed up by the verb that best describes
the required action — capture, defeat, discover, destroy, escape, find, negotiate,
obtain, protect, rescue, and survive are a few examples. In an encounter, charac-
ters might have to capture the master thief, discover the secret door, negotiate
with the ogre mage, or rescue the merchant from the mind flayer’s slave pen.
There are three types of encounters:
 Challenge encounters provide some kind of hazard, trap, or obstacle
that the characters must overcome to attain the goal. Skills, spells, and
ability checks are the tools that characters usually employ to overcome
challenge encounters.
 Combat encounters feature creatures or opponents that the characters
might have to battle in order to win the encounter. Combat abilities and
spells see the most use in these kinds of encounters.
 Roleplaying encounters involve a DM-controlled character (also called
a nonplayer character, or NPC) whom the player characters must inter-
act with to attain the goal of the encounter. They might have to talk to,
convince, bluff, bribe, trade insults with, seduce, negotiate, intimidate,
beg, or otherwise interact with the NPC in order to advance the plot. A
roleplaying encounter can lead to or become a challenge or combat
encounter, depending on how things work out. Such encounters rely on
roleplaying talents, and skill checks are only used sparingly to augment
the roleplaying and to determine the reactions of the NPCs.
Encounters are typically keyed to areas on a map. Only when the player char-
acters arrive at the specific map area can the encounter take place. When all
of the encounters in an adventure take place within the confines of a specific
location (such as a dungeon), the adventure is called a site-based adventure.
This is the easiest type of adventure to create and run, because the whole
story works off the map you draw and the encounters you key to it.
315
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Adventure structure
Good adventures provide choices, points at which the players can make
important decisions that have significant impact on what happens next.
Choices can be as simple as providing the option to go right or left at an
intersection in a dungeon corridor, or as complex as giving the characters the
option to retrieve the crimson wand of doom or destroy it in the dwarven fur-
nace of the undercity.
Good adventures combine the different kinds of encounters and vary the
experiences they provide. Attack, defense, problem-solving, roleplaying, and
investigation should all come into play in varying degrees.
Good adventures are exciting. They provide rising and falling tension, building
action, increasing stakes, and fantastic locations that add to the ambience.
Finally, good adventures provide encounters that make use of the abilities of
the player characters. If one of the players in your group has a rogue charac-
ter, but you never provide that character with the opportunity to be stealthy
and use his or her rogue skills, then that player will have less fun and few
opportunities to shine.
Conversely, don’t restrict character actions or lead the characters around by
their noses just to make sure they get to see every detail of your adventure.
Don’t create situations where the PCs are spectators, watching NPCs accom-
plish all the important tasks. Beware of putting your PCs in situations where
they must be saved by the intervention of others — that’s just not heroic.
And don’t look for ways to countermand or foil what the characters are capa-
ble of. Design interesting encounters where they can employ their abilities to
the best advantage or use them in new and clever ways.
316
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 
Site-based versus event-based adventures
The adventures discussed in this book are site-
based adventures, meaning that they are set in a
single location that is driven by exploration more
than story or a complex plotline. Easy to create
and easy to run, site-based adventures such as
The Tomb of Horrorsand The Temple of Elemental
Evil are infamous among long-time D&D players
for their simplicity and sheer genius.
A more challenging adventure to create is an
event-based adventure, an adventure built
around a series of events that the characters
can influence through their actions. The char-
acters have a complex goal or mission that they
must accomplish, and the encounters that take
place are a direct result of that effort. There may
be maps for many of the encounters, but the
events take place over a course of time or as
triggered by previous events and keyed to a
flowchart, timeline, or some combination of
the two. Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master’s
Guide provides more details on these sorts of
adventures.

The end
Each adventure eventually comes to an end. As an adventure designer, you
should provide a set up for a climactic encounter, but how the adventure
ends depends on the players’ actions. The climactic encounter should take
place in a suitably impressive location. It should feature the boss villain of
the adventure, perhaps someone the characters met early on or someone
they heard rumors of but don’t meet until the final scene.
Sometimes an adventure finishes with a satisfying conclusion that wraps up
all the loose ends. Sometimes the boss villain gets away to challenge the
characters another day. And, once in awhile, the characters discover that the
boss villain takes his orders from a secret, more powerful nemesis they will
meet in the future.
Adventure-builder checklist
As a beginning Dungeon Master, stick to the site-based adventures until you
feel you have the hang of the basics of adventure design. Here’s a checklist to
help you get started as an adventure designer:
 Brainstorm the premise of the adventure and the motivations of your
player characters.
 Sketch a map of the adventure location(s) on a sheet of graph paper.
Number each encounter site on the map.
 Choose the opponents that will populate the adventure, from the weak-
est minions to the most powerful boss villains. Use the Challenge Rating
system (refer to page 48 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) and the Monster
Manual to select opponents that will be an appropriate challenge for
your party.
 Flesh out and key each encounter with notes, tactics, and statistics.
Tables 3-1 and 3-2 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide provide guidelines for
determining the difficulty of encounters. In general, most of the encoun-
ters you create for a particular adventure should have Encounter Levels
(EL) equal to or lower than the party’s level. A few challenging encoun-
ters can have an EL that’s one or two levels higher than the party, while
the climax can have an EL that’s three or four levels higher than the
party. The Challenge Ratings (CRs) of all the opponents in the encounter
determine the encounter’s EL, as shown on Table 3-1 in the Dungeon
Master’s Guide. Use CRs and ELs in conjunction to create balanced
encounters for your party. (The sample dungeon later in this chapter
provides examples of this in play.)
 Check everything over and try to think like your players. Look for clever
ways to overcome certain encounters that don’t necessarily rely on
combat.
317
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Here’s one final nugget of advice — you don’t have to follow any set order
when you create an adventure. You can start with a single cool encounter
idea and build an adventure around it. You can sketch out a map and then fill
in the details. Be creative, have fun, and don’t sweat it.
Sample Dungeon: Hall of the Spider God
This section explores adventure creation by providing you with a finished
sample that you can play and use as a model for your own adventures. It’s
designed for a party of four 1st-level adventurers — a fighter, a rogue, a sor-
cerer, and a cleric. Use the ready-to-play characters presented in Chapters 3
through 6. It will be somewhat tougher if your party has less than four char-
acters, and a bit easier if the party contains more than four characters.
Adventure premise
The long-abandoned dungeon of the evil wizard Volnudar is rumored to lie in
the hills overlooking the town of Briston. In recent days, seven townsfolk
have disappeared and strange creatures have been seen lurking in the shad-
ows of the hills. The town elders have come to the reluctant conclusion that
something stirs in the hidden corridors that once reverberated with the
arcane evil of Volnudar. Now the call goes out: The town elders will reward
the party of adventurers who investigate the hills and learn the fate of the
missing townsfolk. The wizard is long gone, but something evil still resides in
the vile dungeon.
What threatens the town and lurks in the dungeon? A band of monsters, led
by the bugbear Broot, have made the dungeon their home and have been
launching small raids into the town. They worship an even worse monster
that they discovered in the dungeon — a giant spider that Broot has named
Sperrin!
Using the battle grid
One side of the fold-out battle grid included at the beginning of this book fea-
tures a map of dungeon rooms and corridors. Use that map as Volnudar’s
hidden dungeon. The battle grid should be placed, map side up, on the table
within reach of all of the players and the Dungeon Master.
318
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Using the character and monster markers
This sample adventure makes use of all of the monsters provided as markers
along the edge of the battle grid. The statistics for the monsters are provided
later in this chapter. There are also markers that can be used to represent the
adventurers, one for each of the four classes presented in this book.
Place the markers representing the adventurers in the corridor near the
space marked “A” on the map. Let the players arrange the markers as they
see fit, as long as all characters start out in the corridor squares to the far left
side of the map. Remember that each character must occupy a space, and
only one character can be in a square at any time.
Put the monster markers to the side. Don’t place them on the battle grid until
the adventure tells you to.
Adventure key
The Hall of the Spider God features five encounters. The key is numbered, but
the encounters can occur in any order, depending on where the characters
explore and when. Refer to the keyed locations when the characters
approach or enter the numbered areas on the map (see Figure 24-1).
Figure 24-1: The key for the fold-out map at the front of this book.
319
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Starting the adventure
After the players place the markers representing their characters, as
described previously, the DM reads the following out loud:
“You entered the hills above the town of Briston at the request of the
town elders. Seven members of the town have mysteriously disappeared
over the past few days, and the elders have offered a reward for their safe
return or an explanation as to their fate. You have heard rumors that an
evil wizard once called these hills his home, and that his dungeon
remains somewhere beneath the hills. You also learned that mysterious
creatures have been seen lurking in the hills, and the elders believe that
these creatures might be the source of the trouble that has descended
upon Briston.
“After much searching, you discovered an opening in the hillside. Now
you find yourselves in a dark corridor of shaped stone that must be part
of the evil wizard’s lost dungeon.”
Encounter Area A
Encounter Level (EL) None: Not every encounter provides a challenge or
obstacle. This one simply sets the stage for the rest of the adventure, and so
it doesn’t have a listed EL.
The dungeon corridor where the PCs enter has a dank smell of stale air and
age. Lichen streaks the corridor walls, glowing with an eldritch light that pro-
vides shadowy illumination.
Ask the players to make Listen checks for their characters. To make a Listen
check, each player rolls a d20 and adds his or her character’s Listen skill
modifier. The DC for the check is 20.
Failed Listen Check (result is less than 20): The character doesn’t hear any-
thing out of the ordinary in the dark corridor.
Successful Listen Check (result is 20 or better): The character hears the dis-
tant sound of snorts and guttural laughter. (This is coming from Encounter
Area 5.)
Experience Points Award: Each character that makes a successful Listen
check earns 25 XP.
Next: When the characters have looked around and made whatever prepara-
tions they want to, it’s time to move deeper into the dungeon. If the charac-
ters stick to the corridor and head toward the sound, go on to Encounter
Area 5. If they move toward one of the closed doors, go on to that encounter.
320
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Encounter Area 1
Encounter Level (EL) 2: The opponent the PCs face in this encounter has a
Challenge Rating (CR) of 2. Because there’s only one opponent, in this case
the CR and EL are the same.
When the characters approach the door to this room, read the following out
loud:
“The door ahead hangs open the smallest amount, revealing a narrow
crack of torchlight in the room beyond. What do you want to do?”
This is a combat encounter. Ask the players what their characters are doing,
based on the description of the scene you just read to them.
Inside the Room: The characters might swing open the door with wild aban-
don or send a rogue to sneak up and check things out first. Reveal the infor-
mation about the room as you see fit, depending on how the PCs approach
the area.
The room is lit by four torches spaced evenly on the walls of the chamber. A
solid table and chair are near the door, and a tall, muscular, fur-covered bear-
like humanoid sits there, drinking from a large stone mug and picking at the
remains of an animal carcass. This is Broot, a bugbear who leads the orcs and
kobolds that make up the band of marauders that have claimed this dungeon
as their base. He has a morningstar (a spiked mace) and a wooden shield
close at hand, and he can make a Listen check if the characters try to
approach the room quietly.
Broot’s followers believe that the giant spider that resides in Encounter Area
4 is a god. Broot thinks his followers are fools, but he goes along with them
because at the very least, Broot’s luck has changed for the better since meet-
ing the spider. He has named the spider Sperrin, and he plans to feed towns-
folk to it in order to keep his band happy and his luck running strong.
The far end of the room serves as a prison for the townsfolk that Broot and
his band have captured. Currently, four townsfolk (three men and a woman)
are tied up against the far wall opposite the door.
There is also a locked chest (Open Lock DC 15) near the table. It contains
some of the loot that Broot and his band have recently collected. If the PCs
open the chest, they find gems and gold pieces worth 600 gp among bloody
clothes and dirty rags.
Initiative Check: As soon as the PCs notice Broot, or Broot spots the PCs,
call for initiative checks. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modi-
fier to the result. The DM rolls for Broot. The rest of the encounter plays out
in rounds, with characters and monster acting in initiative order.
321
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Markers: Place the bugbear marker along the top wall of the room, two spaces
from the wall with the door. The PC markers start in the corridor. There are no
markers for the prisoners; feel free to use coins or some other items to mark
the positions of the prisoners along the wall farthest from the door.
Broot: The bugbear is a violent, savage foe. He’s extremely confident of his
own abilities, however, and will attempt to defeat the intruding adventurers
on his own, without calling for help. Use the statistics in the “Bugbear” side-
bar for Broot.
The Prisoners: The characters must defeat Broot before they can deal with
the prisoners or the locked chest they find in the room. They can easily free
the townsfolk and point them to the way out after the bugbear falls.
The townsfolk seem grateful for being rescued but nervous and weary from
their ordeal. If the PCs ask the townsfolk about how they got here or what
else is in the dungeon, the townsfolk explain:
“Each of us was captured by that bugbear’s marauders — orcs and kobolds
of the fiercest kind. One of the orcs came in and took Elar and Tob away
about an hour ago. The bugbear laughed and told the orc something about
making sure that Sperrin knew where her meal was coming from. When 
we were first brought here, there was a seventh captive, little Jammy the
tailor’s son. He slipped free of his ropes and ran off into the darkness. We
haven’t seen him since, but we’ve heard the bugbear asking about him
every time some of his marauders entered this room.”

Bugbear
Bugbears are savage creatures that stand 7 feet tall and are covered in coarse hair. They have
long sharp fangs and flat noses, and they possess a keen love of both food and treasure.

The townsfolk don’t know anything else that will help the PCs. One of them
has been hiding a handful of goodberries that he will give to the party as a
reward for rescuing them. There are five goodberries; each one cures 1 hit
point of damage when eaten.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 600 XP for defeating Broot and
rescuing the four townsfolk. In a party of four, each character receives 150 XP.
Next: The characters should attempt to find the rest of the missing townsfolk,
little Jammy and the two prisoners taken to Sperrin.
Encounter Area 2
Encounter Level (EL) 1: The PCs face three opponents in this encounter,
each with a CR 1⁄3. Table 3-1 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide shows that three CR
1⁄3 creatures constitute an EL 1 challenge.
When the characters approach the door to this room, read the following out
loud:
“The door ahead is open wide. As you get closer, you can smell freshly
turned dirt and hear a child crying. What do you want to do?”
This can be a combat encounter or a challenge encounter, depending on how
the characters approach it. Ask the players what their characters are doing,
based on the description of the scene you just read to them.
Inside the Room: The floor of this chamber, unlike the rest of this dungeon,
consists of dirt instead of hewn stone. In the very center of the room stands a
5-foot wide circular stone platform. Atop the platform is a small, ruffled
young boy — Jammy the tailor’s son. Jammy appears tired and frightened,
sitting curled in a ball and trying not to look at the room’s other inhabitants.
Three skeletons surround the platform and Jammy. They stand almost com-
pletely still, swaying ever so slightly, the red lights smoldering in their other-
wise empty eye sockets fixed menacingly on the small boy. Long ago, the evil
wizard Volnudar used this chamber to experiment with spells designed to
raise and control the undead. If any character casts a detect magic spell, the
stone platform glows with an ancient magic that protects whoever stands
upon it from the anger and hatred of undead creatures. That’s all that keeps
little Jammy safe from the animated skeletons.
The room is completely dark except for the tiny fires glowing in the skele-
tons’ eye sockets. The skeletons ignore the characters unless they step into
the room. So, if the players can figure out some way to get Jammy safely out
of the room without stepping onto the dirt floor, their characters won’t have
to battle the skeletons. If the characters do enter the room, however, call for
initiative checks. The skeletons move to attack and destroy any living crea-
tures that enter the chamber. The only space in the room that is safe is atop
the stone platform in the center.
323
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Initiative Check: As soon as the PCs enter the room, call for initiative checks.
Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier to the result. The DM
rolls for the skeletons (one check covers them all, and all three act when
their turn comes up in the initiative). The rest of the encounter plays out in
rounds, with characters and monster acting in initiative order. Use the statis-
tics in the “Skeleton” sidebar for all of the skeletons.
Markers: Place the three skeleton markers around the room’s center square.
The PC markers start in the corridor. Use a coin or some other item to mark
the location of Jammy atop the platform in the center of the room.
Jammy: The characters must defeat the skeletons or otherwise get Jammy
out of this chamber before they can have a meaningful conversation with
him. He explains that the small lizard people chased him into the room, and
he felt safe when they didn’t follow him in. Then the skeletons rose up out of
the dirt and surrounded him. He tells the PCs the following before they point
him toward the exit, but only if they can calm him down with a DC 12
Diplomacy check:
“There’s something really bad in that room across the hall. Really, really
bad.” (Then, after a pause and in a whisper) “It eats people.”
Experience Points Award: The party divides 300 XP for defeating the skele-
tons and/or rescuing little Jammy from the room. In a party of four, each
character receives 75 XP.

Skeleton
Skeletons are the animated bones of humans that wear the tattered remnants of clothes and carry
scimitars and shields. The only sign of life, other than the fact that they move with purpose and

Encounter Area 3 (Part 1)
Encounter Level (EL) 2: This is a challenge encounter that has a trap and a
locked door.
When the characters approach the door to this room, read the following out
loud:
“The door ahead is closed. The heavy wood of the door features ornate
carvings of strange symbols that seem to glow with a faint light. What do
you want to do?”
This starts out as a challenge encounter, because the characters must find a
way to get past the locked door. If they enter the chamber beyond, they face
a combat encounter and the possibility of a magical reward.
The Locked Door: The PCs can check the door and determine that it is
locked. Here are some options for dealing with the door:
Spot Checks: Call for Spot checks (DC 10) when the PCs start to examine the
door. Any character that succeeds notices some scratches around the ancient
lock. It looks like the marauders tried to gain entry into this chamber and
failed.
Search Checks: A rogue character can Search (DC 20) the door for traps. If the
check succeeds, the rogue finds indication of a resetting mechanical trap,
which probably discouraged the marauders from further attempts to open
the door. If the check fails, the door appears to be safe and trap-free as far as
the rogue can determine.
Disable Device Check: If a rogue notices the trap (by making a successful
Search check), he or she can try to disarm it. This requires a Disable Device
check (DC 20). If the check succeeds, the trap is disarmed. If the check fails
by 4 or less, the rogue can try to disarm it again. If the check fails by 5 or
more, the rogue springs the trap (see the following option, The Trap).
Open Locks Check: A rogue can attempt to unlock the door. This Open Locks
check has a DC 20. If the trap has been disarmed, there is no danger. If it
hasn’t been disarmed, any attempt to pick the lock (whether it succeeds or
not) springs the trap (see The Trap). If the rogue successfully picks the lock,
even if doing so sets off the trap, the door can be opened any time thereafter.
Bashing Down the Door: If the rogue’s Open Lock check fails, or the party
doesn’t have a rogue, the door can be bashed open. This requires one char-
acter to make a DC 18 Strength check. This is an ability check; roll a d20 and
add the character’s Strength modifier. Here’s a situation where a special
action, aid another, can be used. One other character can help the acting
character to try to bash open the door. The helping character also makes a
Strength check, but the DC is 10. If the helping character succeeds, then the
325
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

acting character receives a +2 bonus to his or her Strength checks. The char-
acters can make as many attempts as they want to bash down the door. The
first time a character tries to bash down the door, he or she sets off the trap
(if it hasn’t been disarmed). Each attempt to bash down the door, successful
or not, makes a lot of noise. Make a Listen check (DC 15) for the orc in
Encounter Area 5 each time a character makes a Strength check to bash
down the door. If the orc successfully hears the racket, the creatures from
Encounter Area 5 (see the later section, “Encounter Area 5”) start to move
toward Encounter Area 3.
The Trap: The door has a mechanical trap that, when triggered by an Open
Lock or Strength check used on the door, shocks anyone touching the door
or the lock for 1d4+1 damage. The trap resets after one hour.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 300 XP for disarming the trap
and 300 XP for opening the door. If the trap is triggered but they manage to
open the door, the reward is just 300 XP.
Encounter Area 3 (Part 2)
Encounter Level (EL) 1: The PCs face two opponents in this encounter, each
with a CR 1⁄2. Table 3-1 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide shows that two CR 1⁄2 crea-
tures constitute an EL 1 challenge.
When the characters open the door to this room, read the following out loud:
“The door opens into a thick darkness. What do you want to do?”
326

make one action in a round (move or attack, not both)

The PCs need some sort of light in order to explore this chamber effectively.
After they light a torch or otherwise illuminate the scene, read the following
out loud:
“The chamber features rows of dusty shelves and strangely shaped
crates. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, and dust swirls in the air around
you. Then you hear a disturbing sound from somewhere deep in the
shadows: a moaning, threatening sound, and the shuffle of heavy feet
slowly moving toward you. What do you do?”
Inside the Room: This was one of the ancient wizard’s storerooms. Few of his
most powerful items remain, but if the PCs can defeat the chamber’s
guardians, they can find some helpful items and treasure here.
Two human zombies guard this chamber. They were placed here long ago by
Volnudar and continue to follow the last orders they were given — let no
living creature enter this area and survive.
Initiative Check: As soon as the PCs light up the room or enter the chamber,
call for initiative checks. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier
to the result. The DM rolls for the zombies (one check covers both of them, and
both act when their turn comes up in the initiative). The rest of the encounter
plays out in rounds, with characters and monster acting in initiative order.
Use the statistics in the “Zombie” sidebar for both of the zombies.
Markers: Place the two zombie markers in the chamber, one near the center
and one near the far wall. The PC markers start in the corridor.
Treasure: After the PCs defeat the zombies, they can examine the room.
Among the crumbling scrolls and dusty vials, they find four potions of cure
light wounds. If anyone decides to Search, the character that gets the highest
result over 20 finds a magic weapon wrapped in cloth. The weapon matches
the character’s primary weapon, except that it is a +1 version of that weapon
(meaning it has a magical +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls). For example,
if Regdar rolls the highest Search result over 20, he finds a +1 greatsword that
he can use instead of his mundane weapon.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 300 XP for defeating the zombies.
Encounter Area 4
Encounter Level (EL) 3: The PCs face three opponents in this encounter,
each with a different CR. Table 3-1 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide shows that
one CR 2, one CR 1⁄2, and one CR 1⁄4 creature constitutes an EL 3 challenge.
When the characters approach either of the doors that lead to this room,
read the following out loud:
“The door ahead is closed. You can hear chanting coming from beyond
the door, but you don’t understand the words. What do you want to do?”
327
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

The doors into this room are not locked. The PCs can open them easily.
Inside the Room: The first thing the PCs notice upon opening the doors is
that great pans of burning coals (called braziers) are situated to either side of
both sets of doors, filling the room with firelight and smoke. The second thing
they notice are the two creatures kneeling before a raised platform covering the
left half of the long wall. One creature is an orc, the other a kobold. Atop the
platform, tied up and obviously frightened, are the last two townsfolk — Elar
and Tob. The third thing is that the entire right side of the room is covered in
curtains of thick, clinging webs.
If the PCs enter quietly, they can surprise the orc and the kobold. That means
that each of the PCs can perform one action (either a move or an attack)
before the regular rounds of initiative begin.
When the battle is fully joined, Sperrin emerges from the webs to attack the
intruders. Sperrin is a giant spider that the orcs and kobolds worship as a
god. The townsfolk are meant to be a meal and a sacrifice for the giant spider.
Initiative Check: Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier to
the result. The DM rolls once for the kobold (his check covers the kobold
and the orc, who both act when their turn comes up in the initiative), and
once for the giant spider. The rest of the encounter plays out in rounds, with
characters and monsters acting in initiative order. Use the statistics in the
“Orc,” “Kobold,” and “Giant spider” sidebars for the orc, kobold, and giant
spider.

PCs step into a square more than halfway along the corridor, or the orc makes
a successful Listen check when the PCs make noise trying to open the door
to Encounter Area 3.
Use the kobold and orc statistics from Encounter Area 4 (see the “Orc” and
“Kobold” sidebars in this chapter). These two creatures can be encountered
alone, or they can join the zombies in Encounter Area 3 to make a more chal-
lenging encounter.

Keeping Your Players Happy
In This Chapter
 Knowing your players
 Providing challenges for all players
 Making sure that everybody has fun
 Deciding what kind of game you want to run
A
great Dungeon Master doesn’t just run a good DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game;
he or she also tells a riveting story. The D&D game works fine as a series
of tactical exercises and problem-solving puzzles, but a great storyteller
behind the DM’s screen can elevate the game to a whole other level. Building
interesting story lines and villains for your adventures and presenting your
players with the sort of challenges they want to face goes a long way toward
making your game a memorable and long-lasting one.
In this chapter, we tell you about story-building and storytelling in the D&D
game, and we show you some narrative, game pacing, and campaign building
tips good for any D&D game.
Figuring Out Your Players
The first rule of any enterprise is to figure out what your customers want and
give it to them. A D&D game is no different. If your players just want to kill
monsters and not think too hard, they’re not going to be happy with a subtle
murder mystery or combat-light court intrigue. Similarly, if your players love
to immerse themselves in their characters and enjoy the play-acting more
than anything else, they won’t be happy if you present adventures that don’t
give them opportunities to talk to the creatures and characters around them.

Most players fall into one of four basic categories:
 Actors: These are players who enjoy roleplaying for its own sake.
Extreme actors would be just as happy to play D&D if it had no rules at
all. Players who like this style of play often choose the bard, ranger, and
rogue classes. They like adventures that have lots of opportunities to
talk to NPCs (not just villains and monsters), and they tend to dislike
adventures that offer nothing but combat encounters.
 Puzzle-solvers: This type of player loves figuring out riddles and chal-
lenges in the game. Extreme puzzle-solvers would be just as happy to play
D&D without rules, just like the extreme actors. Puzzle-solvers often play
clerics, rogues, and wizards. Puzzle-solvers don’t mind combat encounters,
because beating tactically challenging encounters (such as archers on
a castle wall) is solving puzzles of sorts. They like adventures that offer
chances to solve riddles and puzzles as players at the gaming table, and
not just by rolling dice as characters in the game.
 Hack-and-slashers: These are players who just love to fight and beat up
monsters. The bigger the fight, the happier they are. Hack-and-slashers
live for dishing out the damage, and they’re inclined to like the rules,
because the game rules help them figure out how much damage they can
deal out. Hack-and-slashers often play barbarians, fighters, and sorcer-
ers. Obviously, they like adventures with plenty of monsters to fight, and
they don’t like adventures that involve too much talking.
 Competitors: These are those players who play for the thrill of winning
in whatever form it might take. They’re happy to fight big fights and win,
but unlike the hack-and-slasher, they’re just as happy to win by doing
roleplaying or solving tough puzzles. Competitors tend to be heavily
engaged with the rules, and they don’t like to throw out the rulebooks.
You can throw a variety of challenges at a competitor, and he or she is
happy. Competitors often play clerics, fighters, and wizards.
Now, here’s the tricky part: You probably have players of more than one type
in your game. One player may like roleplaying, another might like combat, and
a third player might be interested solely in beating the game. The best way to
keep everybody happy is to simply alternate the types of encounters to cater
to your players’ various interests. Intersperse roleplaying encounters with
combat encounters and challenge encounters, and you can make exciting
adventures that feel varied and fresh where everybody gets the game he or
she wants at least some of the time.
Table 25-1 summarizes some key adventure characteristics or features and
which players are happiest with them.

ing the rules better than anyone else
If you’re trying to keep everyone happy with the same adventure, try to include
some “good” or “great” situations for each player at your table. You’ll find that
hack-and-slashers are a little difficult to entertain; they tend to be impatient
and anxious to get to the next fight, and more than a few hack-and-slashers
will look for ways to manufacture fights if none are at hand.
This table makes hack-and-slashers look like the worst players, but that’s
somewhat misleading. If most of the players at the table enjoy a lot of combat
and view playing D&D as a way to let off steam by pretending to kill mon-
sters, well, who’s to say that’s not the right way for them to play the game?
Hack-and-slashers are often pretty knowledgeable about the rules, and tend
to run decisive and effective characters. Sure, they’re impatient to get to the
fun, but a hack-and-slasher at the table can go a long way toward keeping the
other players moving and motivated.
333
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy

Narrating the Adventure
Knowing what your players like and catering to them is nothing more than
good marketing. But a crummy movie with great marketing is still a crummy
movie. What you need is some great writing and great directing to get an
entertainment experience that will have your players on the edges of their
seats. So what can you do to run a game that’s fast-paced, exciting, emotion-
ally charged, and makes your players feel like they can slay dragons and 
challenge gods?
Getting ready, getting organized
It’s so simple we hesitate to mention it, but we will anyway: Be ready to run
your game. Read ahead on the adventure you’re running, visualize how
you’re going to set up the key encounters and decision points, and plan for
what you’re going to do when the players take a wrong turn. You shouldn’t be
seeing an encounter for the first time when the players kick open the door to
Room 7 and storm inside.
The corollary to reading ahead is organizing your materials to run the game
efficiently and effectively. Nothing brings a game to a crashing halt like the
DM saying, “Uh, hang on guys, I gotta do some reading.” Pausing for a moment
to check your notes is one thing, but sticking your nose in the book to read
for 10 minutes means that your players are sitting around doing nothing but
watching you read. That ain’t great entertainment.
Good ways to be prepared include the following tips:
 Check the rules ahead of time: If you see that you’re likely to run an
encounter involving a whole gang of basilisks, refresh your memory on
how gaze attacks work and read the monster description the night
before the game.
 Make notes in your adventure: Plan some actions or special moves for
your monsters and villains ahead of time. Think about things that NPCs
might say if the players wind up talking instead of fighting.
 Keep a folder: Organize your adventure notes and any records you’re
keeping (treasure the heroes find, NPCs they meet, and so on) so that
you can quickly find information when you need it during play.

Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Creating evocative scenes
Your players are immersed in an imaginary world of soaring beauty, awesome
magic, and horror beyond human endurance. It’s your job to get this across
with each scene you describe and every action your monsters and villains take.
You don’t have to stick three adjectives in front of every character or object
you describe in the game, but you don’t want to fall into the rut of droning,
“The minotaur swings. He misses. The minotaur swings again. Uh, he gets an
18. Does that hit you?” Put some zip into it!
Boring: “The room is 30 feet by 30 feet. There’s a door in the north wall,
and a stairway leading down. There’s an ogre in here.”
Better: “The room smells dank and musty. It looks like an old cellar, with
thick cobwebs in the blackened rafters. A towering creature with long
arms and a crooked, fang-filled jaw glares at you, clutching a spiked club
in its knotted fists. Behind it you think you see a battered old door in the
north wall, and a set of stairs leading down into darkness.”
Boring: “The ogre charges and attacks. It rolls a 23. It hits you for 17 points
of damage.”
Better: “The hulking monster throws back its head and howls in rage, and
then it throws itself at you! It brings its spiked club whistling down in a
deadly arc — that’s a 23 to hit. Unnh! A mighty blow sends you reeling.
You take 17 points of damage. ‘Ha! I SMASH!’ the creature bellows.”
Boring: “The hell hound breathes fire. You take 8 fire damage.”
Better: “The coal-black hound suddenly belches out a great blast of sear-
ing green flames. You take 8 points of fire damage.”
Using the cut-scene
One handy trick for DMing multiple tasks at the same time is the cut-scene.
Here’s the idea: Give one player and whatever task he’s involved in 5 to
10 minutes of your time, then put that situation on hold and switch over to
work with another player on whatever she’s doing. It’s like a movie that hops
between a couple of different characters doing different things. It’s a great
tool for pacing, because it lets you briefly “cliffhanger” a player in a challeng-
ing position (which builds suspense) while you involve another player who
otherwise wouldn’t be immediately involved in the scene (which keeps the
players out of the key action from getting bored).
335
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy

Cut-scenes work best when the party is split up. If some characters are fight-
ing against assassins in a dark alleyway while other characters are trying to
help the elven ambassador make her escape, you can easily switch back and
forth between the two groups.
Cut-scenes also work on a smaller scale, when players are engaged in different
tasks in the same area. For example, say that the PCs are searching through
an evil wizard’s laboratory. One might be searching for secret doors, another
might be looking through the mysterious old tomes on the bookshelf for any
interesting clues, and a third player might be talking to the wizard’s captive, a
human hero chained to the wall. You might start by DMing the player’s con-
versation with the captive hero. Then when you reach a good break in the
conversation, you switch over to tell another player what her rogue found
when she searched the room. Then you switch over to the player whose
character was looking at the books. As the DM, you’re the director of the
movie; you decide which player you’re going to talk to, for how long, and
where you’re going to cut away to next.
Running a Fun Game
If you’re creating interesting adventures for your players, and you’re doing
a good job of narrating and pacing the game, you’re ahead of the eight ball.
However, the game isn’t all about the adventures you write and your ability to
describe the action — you want to run a fun and entertaining game as much
as a well-crafted one.
Using props
One great way to take your players from listening to experiencing is to intro-
duce some props in your game. If the players defeat the sly rogue who’s been
carrying coded messages for the thieves’ guild, make up a set of cryptic coded
messages ahead of time, write them on a piece of paper, and crumple it up for
effect — and if you stain the paper with tea or coffee, you might even get it to
look a little like parchment. (If you don’t want to mess with staining paper,
you can find colored paper and parchment paper at any office supply store.)
Not only will the puzzle-solvers in your group have a great time unraveling
your code, but everyone else will like passing around a tangible object they
can peer at and study, just like their characters would.
Old maps and secret messages are easy props to come up with. If you want to
go a step further, try handfuls of old coins (especially foreign currency), tarot
cards, books in foreign languages, and sketches or artwork. Anything that lets
your players visualize the scene or item you’re describing verbally is great.
Not every encounter or challenge deserves a prop or handout, but a few here
and there go a long way toward keeping your players interested and alert.

One prop you might not have thought of is a soundtrack. A little music played
softly in the background as you play the game can be very evocative. You’ll
want to consider your music choice carefully, of course; the ideal piece is
something that’s orchestral, doesn’t have many words or singing for the DM
to compete with, and frankly just feels like it fits with the D&D game. Movie
soundtracks can be great for this, especially from fantasy or science fiction
movies — you could do worse than to play the soundtracks for the three Lord
of the Rings movies, for example. Some companies actually produce sound-
tracks specifically to serve as roleplaying background music. Good choices
include Dungeons & Dragons the Official Roleplaying Soundtrack (produced by
Midnight Syndicate) and the Shards of Eberron CD soundtrack included with
Sharn: City of Towers supplement.
Table rules
Every group of D&D players gradually evolves a set of table rules — 
conventions for starting new characters, looking up rules on the fly, urging
other players to take specific actions, or simply whether to reroll or read as
it lies when a die is cocked or falls on the floor. These rules really don’t have
much to do with the D&D game, because your table rules might conceivably
apply to any number of other games you play with the same group of players.
But it’s a good idea to lay out your expectations on this sort of thing before
an argument comes up about what is or isn’t allowed at your table.
337
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy

Some things you ought to clarify ahead of time include the following:
 What to do when a player can’t make the game (specifically, is his or her
character present in the party or not, and who controls the character
if he or she is).
 Which rulebooks and supplements you allow players to refer to in play
(many DMs prefer that players don’t look up monsters in a Monster
Manual while their characters are fighting the creature in question).
 Whether or not you’ll allow “take backs” if a player figures out that his or
her attack roll was really a 24 instead of a 21 after his or her action is over.
If you’re a new DM running the game for an experienced group, you might want
to simply adopt the table rules of the previous DM until you feel comfortable
with instituting your own. You’ll find a good discussion on table rules on page
11 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 
How honest should you be?
You’re DMing a furious fight. Joe’s paladin Baldror
blows his Reflex save against the evil wizard’s
lightning bolt and gets knocked down to 7 hit
points. Then the wizard’s ogre henchman rolls a
20 against Baldror and scores a critical hit with
his greataxe. Baldror’s going to eat 2d8+8
damage, tripled for the crit — probably 40 or 50
points, easy. Do you let this lucky hit kill Baldror
outright? Or do you fudge the result and tell Joe
that Baldror got hit for 12, keeping the critical to
yourself so that you don’t kill Joe’s character?
There isn’t an easy answer to this one. Some
DMs let the dice do their work, and they don’t cut
any breaks for the player characters or the bad
guys. Other DMs feel that a character death is a
pretty big occurrence, and it shouldn’t happen
“by mistake” — so, as long as the dice were
rolled behind the screen and no players observed
the result, it’s okay to fudge by announcing a miss
or two when a monster really would have hit.
Our recommendation for a beginning DM is to
avoid fudging and to let your players know you’re
going to let the dice fall where they may. If you
do decide to fudge the dice behind the screen,
don’t announce it to the players and don’t make
it obvious. You shouldn’t intercede to rescue every
character on the threshold of death, because if
your players realize that there’s no chance for
their characters to be killed, their enjoyment of
the game will be diminished — no risk and no
challenge means no suspense. And if the play-
ers attempted something that was obviously
highly risky (or simply stupid), you shouldn’t pro-
tect them from the consequences of their own
poor decisions.
One more thing: Just because the DM may fudge
the rolls every now and then, we strongly advise
you not to try to do this as a player. When DMs
“cheat,” it’s usually for the effort of improving
the play experience of everyone at the table. If
you cheat by pretending you didn’t roll badly as a
player, you’re doing it to beat the game. It’s only
going to lead to a diminished experience for you,
and may in fact cause a lot of trouble around the
table if you’re caught doing it. Most players can’t
abide a cheater, even one who’s on their side.

Game balance
Keeping a game fun and interesting requires that you keep an eye on the bal-
ance of your game. Game balance basically comes down to two dimensions:
 Risk versus reward: This basically measures how dangerous your dun-
geon is compared to the payoff in treasure, experience, and the fun your
players get out of the game session. If your adventures just cream party
after party of PCs, or if you can’t remember the last time you got a PC
down to half his or her hit points, your game might be out of balance. It’s
not fun to lose all the time — and believe it or not, it’s not really fun to
win all the time, either. A healthy game features a sprinkling of setbacks
and retreats that the players can learn from.
 Player versus player: The question of player versus player balance
arises when one or more of the characters at the table is clearly better
than another character. If you’ve got a party of four 8th-level characters
and one 3rd-level character, how much fun do you think the player of
the 3rd-level character is having? Trickier balance issues may arise
when one player gets his or her hands on a magic item, feat, or spell
that makes his or her character significantly more effective than the
rest of the party.
To maintain good player versus player balance, consider the following
pointers:
• Make sure that no character in the party really steps on another
character. If players stick to segregated character roles, direct
comparison is pointless. Of course, the cleric doesn’t fight as well
as the fighter, but the fighter can’t cast all those cleric spells; both
do different things and do them well.
• Think about how you handle character death and the introduction
of new characters into the campaign. If you insist that everybody
starts at 1st level, then clearly the player who joins your game as
a 1st-level character when the 8th-level heroes are battling mind
flayers and umber hulks is in for a hard time. Many DMs allow new
characters to join a game at one or two levels behind the average
level of the rest of the party.
• Watch out for magic treasure that is useful only for one character.
If you put a +4 flaming keen bastard sword in your adventure, you
have to figure that the fighter in the party will claim this 72,000 gp
item. If the other choices in the monster hoard are a +2 ring of pro-
tection and a couple of potions of cure light wounds, somebody in the
party just scored ten times better than everybody else. You can give
unique and powerful treasures to characters, but you can’t give
those items to the same character every game session.

Chapter 26
The Ten Best Sorcerer Spells
You might think that sorcerers and wizards are pretty weak characters.
They can’t wear armor effectively, they have low hit points, and their
saving throws aren’t too good either. But what they do have is a lot of arcane
spells — the most powerful and flexible spells in the game. Armed with these
spells, sorcerers and wizards can easily come to dominate the game. There are
few monsters or obstacles a high-level sorcerer or wizard can’t easily defeat
with the right spell. Of course, the trick lies in choosing the right spell, which
is why we’re covering this topic here.
Choosing the right spells is important for a wizard, but it’s absolutely crucial
for the sorcerer. The wizard will eventually have a spellbook filled with possi-
bilities, but every spell choice the sorcerer makes excludes other choices.
The Player’s Handbook lists 39 1st-level sorcerer/wizard spells, but even the
highest-level sorcerer only knows five of them.
Just so you know, we excluded spells of 6th level or higher from this list on pur-
pose. Naturally, high-level spells are better than low-level spells; if we compiled
a list of spells strictly by power level, we’d use ten 8th- and 9th-level spells.
That’s not so useful for a player of a low-level sorcerer struggling with the deci-
sion of which spells to learn now, which spells to wait for, and which to never
learn. Think of this list as “the ten sorcerer spells that will help your character
reach 10th level,” not “the ten spells that a 10th-level sorcerer likes best.”
For a full description of each spell (its effects, amount of damage dealt, dura-
tion, and so on) listed in this chapter, see Chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook.
10. Mirror Image
The list of 2nd-level spells contains some great spells; choosing the five that
your sorcerer knows is tough. Mirror image competes with blur, alter self, and
web, but we chose mirror image because nothing is as good at saving your
bacon when your sorcerer is surrounded by three angry ogres. Even at higher
levels, your character’s mirror image spell is great for getting dangerous foes
to waste attacks striking or blasting at nothing.

9. Hold Monster
We would have ranked hold monster higher, but the fact that it’s a 5th-level
spell means that you have to trudge through 8 or 9 levels of your sorcerer’s
adventuring career without it. Hold monster is a “save-or-die” spell that can
paralyze anything susceptible to compulsion effects. Many monsters have an
Achilles’ heel in their Will saves, and hold monster allows your sorcerer to
exploit that weakness and end almost any encounter in the first round.
8. Fly
The 3rd-level spell list includes so many good choices that it’s hard to pick just
one. Certainly, dispel magic, haste, and suggestion are very strong choices, too.
But we’re going with fly because it is a critical capability that any adventuring
party needs to have available after reaching a certain level. Many monsters
simply have no answer to a flying opponent, allowing you to win an encounter
with ease. And fly lets your character breeze past almost any vertical obstacle
in a dungeon or in the wilderness, such as a cliff, chasm, or pit.
(We would have chosen dispel magic for this slot, but here’s the deal: Your
cleric buddy can prepare dispel magic as a cleric spell, covering your party’s
dispelling needs. Your sorcerer has to save spell picks for spells the cleric
can’t replicate.)
7. Stoneskin
There are three 4th-level spells that just rock: improved invisibility, polymorph,
and stoneskin. For this spot on the Top Ten, we’re going with stoneskin. It is
an extraordinarily effective defense against 99 percent of the monsters and
villains your character will meet. Better yet, your sorcerer can cast it on friends;
a fighter with stoneskin can stand in front of almost any monster and shrug
off its attacks while he or she carves it to pieces.
6. Sleep
Many people feel that sleep is insanely good for a 1st-level spell. With one spell,
your sorcerer might drop two, three, or four low-level opponents, destroying
an encounter outright. It’s true that sleep is just devastating against the right
opponents — but we find that after your character reaches 2nd or 3rd level
and starts fighting CR 2 or 3 monsters, the odds of clobbering a creature with
a sleep spell drop off drastically. In fact, many players with sorcerer characters
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

use their 4th-level spell swap to chuck sleep and learn something else. Still,
for all that, sleep is a game-breaker for a 1st-level party. Nothing will help
your sorcerer get to 2nd level faster.
5. Teleport
Like fly (#8 on the list), teleport is a crucial character capability that lets your
sorcerer and other characters escape from even the direst situations. Choosing
the right time to leave the dungeon saves more characters’ lives than any other
tactic, spell, or magic item. As long as your sorcerer has a teleport spell handy,
the adventuring party is only one standard action away from a cold ale and
hot dinner at their favorite tavern, no matter how bad things are getting in
the dungeon.
We would have ranked this spell higher, but the fact that it’s a 5th-level spell
means that you have to wait a long time before your character is of a high
enough level to get it.
4. Fireball
The best spells simply change the game when your character acquires them,
and fireball is the perfect example. The ability to deal heavy damage to multi-
ple foes at the same time is a major ramp-up in your sorcerer’s power. Before
you get fireball, you look at a roomful of enemies and resign yourself to taking
out one, maybe two, with your sorcerer’s first spell. After fireball, your sorcerer
might clean out the whole encounter in one devastating shot. Better yet, unlike
the sleep or hold monster spells, the damage from a fireball stacks with the
damage the fighter and rogue are dishing out with their attacks. Even if your
sorcerer doesn’t wipe out all the monsters in one shot, you make the encounter
easier for everyone else. (Remember to avoid frying your friends with the
spell; if they’re too close to the bad guys, they’ll take damage, too.)
Lightning bolt is every bit as good as fireball; you could pick either one and do
just fine.
3. Polymorph
The king of 4th-level spells is polymorph. The amount of versatility offered by
the spell is just crazy. You want defense? Use polymorph to change your char-
acter into something with a good AC, like a hag. You want offense? Change your
character into something with a high Strength and great natural attacks, like a
dragon. Need to save a buddy from a cave-in? Find a monster with a burrowing
345
Chapter 26: The Ten Best Sorcerer Spells

speed and dig for him or her. Better yet, you can use this same spell to change
other players’ characters into whatever you need them to be. Polymorph
rewards the player who knows the Monster Manual well, and it’s just fun, too.
2. Invisibility
We probably would have dropped this a spot or two, but the fact that it’s only
a 2nd-level spell means that invisibility is one of the best options available in
the game. It’s a tremendously powerful defense against most monsters or vil-
lains if you choose to use this spell and not to attack directly. Invisibility lets
your character flee from almost anything easily, and its usefulness for scout-
ing and sneaking into places is obvious. Best of all, it works great when your
sorcerer casts it on allies, too. The rogue loves being invisible to set up his or
her sneak attack, and the invisible cleric is free to move around and heal up
friends in the thickest of fights.
1. Magic Missile
And the best sorcerer/wizard spell is . . . MAGIC MISSILE!
We chose magic missile as the best because it’s the spell your character is
likely to cast more than any other spell — especially if you’re playing a 
sorcerer. While its damage is not especially good (not at caster level 1 or
2, anyway), magic missile always hits. The ability to stick a few points of
damage on the bad guys at will is tremendously useful. At 3rd level, magic
missile gives an average of 7 points of damage; at 5th level, 10 points; at
7th level, 14 points; and at 9th level, 17 points. No saving throw, no attack
roll, no energy resistance, no nothing. Just damage, pure and simple. Better
yet, magic missile lets your character damage things that other characters
have a very difficult time hurting, such as monsters with damage reduction
or incorporeal (ghostly) monsters like shadows or wraiths.
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
So unfair we hesitate to mention it
Here’s an especially dirty trick: Cast invisibility,
and then skulk back out of the fight while using
summon monster spells to attack the enemy.
Believe it or not, this doesn’t bust your invisibility,
so your sorcerer can remain safe while sum-
moned monsters do the fighting for him or her.
While you’re at it, you might as well place the
summoned monsters to take up flanking positions
that help your fighter and rogue buddies with
their attacks. Other players won’t be so quick to
call you a coward if your sorcerer’s summoned
monsters are giving their characters +2 flanking
bonus to hit.

Chapter 27
The Ten Best Cleric Spells
U
nlike sorcerers or wizards, who find their spell choices constrained
by the number of spells known or in the contents of their spellbooks,
clerics get to peruse the whole cleric spell list every day when they prepare
spells. Choosing the right spell is an important step toward a successful
adventure.
As in Chapter 26, we’re excluding spells of 6th level or higher from this list.
We also exclude spells that only appear on the various cleric domain spell
lists; although we like the holy smite spell a lot, the fact that it’s not available
to every cleric means that we didn’t consider it for the Top Ten. Finally, we
also left off the cure wounds spells because clerics of good or neutral align-
ment can use spontaneous casting to cast a cure wounds spell in place of any
other prepared spell of the same level, making all of those spells are available
to your cleric at any time, so there’s no point in picking them in preference to
other spells of the same level.
10. Air Walk
We agonized over this one, because there are a number of very good 4th-level
cleric spells. If you’re into melee combat, divine power is a very solid choice.
And, in the right encounter, freedom of action or neutralize poison can save
your bacon. But we went with air walk because getting airborne offers a char-
acter a tremendous tactical advantage against many monsters. Characters or
creatures subject to the air walk spell aren’t any faster in the air than they
are on the ground (unlike the sorcerer’s fly spell, which increases speed to 60
feet), but air walk lasts ten times as long as fly. Consider throwing air walk on
your sorcerer buddy, and let him or her have the benefit of using his or her
spells from the safety of altitude. Or throw it on your barbarian or monk
friend, and watch him or her run circles around (and over) the bad guys.

9. Bull’s Strength
The cleric has several interesting spells at 2nd level, but the one we like the
second-best is bull’s strength. It’s the quintessential buff spell, a quick and
easy way for your cleric to give up some spell power and hand one ally a +2
to attack rolls and damage rolls by temporarily increasing his or her Strength
score. You can always choose to throw this spell on your own character, too.
Two other 2nd-level spells deserve some mention here: lesser restoration
and remove paralysis. While bull’s strength is a good offensive choice, you
might do well to take a spell that counters a dangerous condition such as
being held or poisoned. Clerics have a critical responsibility to be able to fix
problems such as poison, paralysis, or ability score damage, because no
other character in the party can. Lesser restoration and remove paralysis can
literally be life-savers if the adventurers happen to run across monsters that
use attacks such as these.
8. Summon Monster III
The various summon monster spells are the only ones that allow a cleric’s
offensive spell power to match that of the sorcerer’s. Summon monster III hap-
pens to occupy a particularly sweet spot in the cleric’s spell list because
most other 3rd-level cleric spells are just not very sexy. In other words, if
you’re going to select a summon monster spell or two for your arsenal, then
go with summon monster III, because you’ll have a hard time turning down the
other available 2nd- or 4th-level spells you’d have to pass up in order to take
summon monster II or IV.
7. Death Ward
Some of the most dangerous monster attacks in the game are ability drain
and energy drain attacks. Death ward is the spell that shuts them down.
There aren’t many spells that can pull the fangs out of an otherwise terrifying
encounter in quite the same way. This spell is particularly good against the
undead.
Although we like death ward for its comprehensive protection, we have to
admit that there are many other fine 4th-level spells for clerics. We readily
admit that unless you run into something undead, death ward is quite likely
to wind up as the first 4th-level spell you chuck in order to convert to a cure
critical wounds spell when you use your spontaneous casting class ability.
But if you’ve got reason to expect your cleric might be facing undead, you’ve
got no excuse not to prepare this spell.
348
Part V: The Part of Tens 

6. Flame Strike
One of the best damage-dealing spells available to any character, flame strike
is every bit as effective as the sorcerer’s cone of cold at 5th level. Yes, it affects
a much smaller area, but it’s also far more precise; you rarely manage to catch
more than two or three enemies in an area-effect spell anyway, so flame strike’s
smaller footprint is rarely a real drawback. And the fact that half of flame strike’s
damage is sheer divine power (that is, not fire, electricity, or any other kind
of energy) means that any foe you hit with flame strike is guaranteed to take
at least a little damage.
5. Dispel Magic
This is one of those key capabilities you really want to have available in the
adventuring party by the time your character reaches 5th or 6th level. Many
bad things can happen to your character or your allies through enemy magic —
for example, one of your allies might be charmed, dominated, or slowed by
an enemy spellcaster. Dispel magic gives your cleric a fighting chance to negate
at least some of those effects. It’s also a great offensive spell when your cleric
is fighting a group of bad guys who are using “buffing” tactics, such as a band
of orc warriors under the effect of a haste spell.
Sorcerers and wizards have access to dispel magic too, but it’s generally
better for the cleric to prepare this spell. The sorcerer doesn’t want to devote
a precious spell known slot to learning dispel magic if he or she can help it,
and the wizard’s 3rd-level spell slots offer many other attractive options,
especially compared to the 3rd-level spells a cleric might take.
4. Divine Favor
If you’re playing the sort of cleric who just loves to wade into battle and crack
some heads with his or her mace, then divine favor is for you. By casting this
spell, your cleric gets a +1 on attack and damage rolls. Better yet, the type of
bonus conferred by the spell is a luck bonus, and luck bonuses apply no matter
what other spells or effects your character is benefiting from; they always
stack. The spell also scales up rapidly, so that the attack and damage bonus
improve quickly as your cleric gains levels. With divine favor, a cleric built for
melee combat can temporarily equal (or even surpass) the party fighter in
ability to deal out damage with melee attacks.
Another 1st-level spell we like a lot is shield of faith. Together with divine favor,
these spells form a great one-two punch, boosting your character’s AC as well
as his or her attack and damage rolls.
349
Chapter 27: The Ten Best Cleric Spells

3. Protection from Evil
This excellent defensive spell gives your character a +2 bonus to Armor
Class and a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws against attacks made by
evil creatures. It also protects your character against the natural attacks
of summoned monsters. No other 1st-level spell offers as many defensive
benefits in one spell as protection from evil. And, better yet, your cleric can
bestow this spell on one ally instead of keeping the benefit for him or herself.
Buffing the party’s fighter is an excellent strategy for beating many encoun-
ters, and a few extra points of AC goes a long way toward keeping a fighter in
the fight.
The only real drawback to protection from evil is that the bonuses it confers
(a deflection bonus to AC, and a resistance bonus to saving throws) replicate
the effects of common magic items, such as the ring of protection and the
cloak of resistance. By the time your character is about 5th level, he or she
probably has one or the other of these items (if not both), which means you
won’t get as much benefit out of protection from evil as you used to. But until
that time, it’s an excellent spell choice.
2. Raise Dead
Nothing ruins the day like a character getting killed, but raise dead can fix
that. It’s not free — your character has to spend 5,000 gp on the material
component, after all — but it lets the party pick up the adventure and con-
tinue with the fallen ally, instead of burying the poor sod and finding the
party short a fighter, rogue, sorcerer, or whatever. Plus, it means that the
player who was running that character doesn’t have to start from scratch
with a brand-new character or sit around for the rest of the game session
doing nothing because his or her character is, well, dead.
Raise dead has three significant drawbacks. First, it’s a 5th-level spell, so it
won’t help you when your character is still a novice adventurer. Second, the
cost is significant. You don’t want your character to cast this spell each day
if you can help it. Finally, the character that’s being raised comes back to life
one experience level lower than he or she was before dying, so there’s defi-
nitely a penalty for having gotten killed. But even with all that, raise dead is
still an irreplaceable choice in any cleric’s arsenal.
350
Part V: The Part of Tens 

1. Hold Person
The top choice in cleric spells isn’t as clear-cut as it is in sorcerer/wizard
spells, but it’s still a strong one: Hold person is a save-or-die spell that’s only
a 2nd-level spell for a cleric.
The big limitation on hold person is, of course, the fact that it only affects
people — creatures of the humanoid type. It won’t help you beat dragons,
demons, or even angry ogres. But it is lethally effective against evil fighters,
orc barbarians, bugbear ambushers, duergar raiders, or what-have-you. Most
NPC villains are humanoids of some kind, which means that a disproportion-
ate amount of the enemies your character faces will be vulnerable to a hold
person spell.

Chapter 28
The Ten Best Low-Level Monsters
F
inish this sentence: “It ain’t a great D&D game until we’ve fought a
_________.” What’s your answer? An orc? A dragon? An evil wizard?
In this chapter, we try to answer that question for low-level games. Although
it’s true that big red dragons, mind flayers, and mummies are great D&D mon-
sters, you can’t really throw powerful monsters like that at a party of 1st-level
characters and expect them to survive. So, we split up this Top Monsters list
into a low-level version and a high-level version. This chapter tackles the low-
level monsters, of course.
We built this list by considering monsters of Challenge Rating 3 and lower,
although we slipped one CR 4 monster onto the list. (Don’t tell anyone.) We
also made an effort to spread out our picks among creatures of different types
and different Challenge Ratings. (A creature’s Challenge Rating tells you what
level of characters a single monster of that type is a suitable challenge for; for
example, a CR 2 monster is a good challenge for a party of 2nd-level charac-
ters.) Every monster also includes its Challenge Rating (or CR), so that you
brand-new Dungeon Masters out there can decide for yourselves whether
your players are ready for them.
10. Stirge (CR 1/2)
(Monster Manual page 236)
What’s creepier than a giant mosquito that can suck a person dry? A whole
flock of giant mosquitoes, that’s what. Stirges are fun because they introduce
players to the power of some monsters to drain ability score points. They
also fly and grapple. Yes, they’re individually weak, but there’s nothing quite
as horrifying for characters (and their players) as watching one of their com-
rades thrashing about with two or three stirges attached at the same time.

9. Hell Hound (CR 3)
(Monster Manual page 151)
Hell hounds make it onto the list because they’re the first serious representa-
tives of a class of monsters your players will be fighting against for their
whole careers: evil outsiders. Outsiders are monsters like demons, devils, and
such. They’re from other planes of existence (the Nine Hells, in the case of
the hell hound) and are therefore “outside” the normal world. Hell hounds
are also interesting because they introduce players to monsters with an area-
effect attack (their fiery breath) and the ability to deal extra fire damage with
every bite.
8. Young White Dragon (CR 4)
(Monster Manual page 78)
We had to include a dragon, didn’t we? It’s in the name of the darned game,
after all. But dragons generally aren’t very good low-level monsters. The weak-
est dragons start at CR 2 or 3, in which case, the characters are fighting a
wyrmling — a baby dragon just about fresh out of the egg. We think it’s more
satisfying for characters to battle against a dragon that’s at least as big as a
person, if not bigger. The young white dragon offers the best chance for this
kind of fight, even if its Challenge Rating makes it the toughest of our top ten
low-level monsters. Better yet, the young white dragon is one of the sample
dragons that have already been assembled for you to use straight out of the
Monster Manual. (You have to do a lot of work to assemble a dragon if you
don’t use one of the sample dragons provided.)
7. Large Monstrous Spider (CR 2)
(Monster Manual page 289)
A surprising number of low-level D&D monsters are big bugs. Monstrous spi-
ders are the scariest and most representative of this crew, thanks to J.R.R.
Tolkien. Who isn’t creeped out by the notion of a spider the size of a horse?
The large monstrous spider is good because it lets your players fight a Large-
sized creature that’s only CR 2. And it also introduces players to the poison
rules . . . mwah hah hah hah.

6. Werewolf (CR 3)
(Monster Manual page 175)
The werewolf is a classic monster. Everybody understands the fear of letting
out the beast within, the feral killer deep inside. Not only is the werewolf an
iconic legendary monster, it’s also interesting in the context of the D&D rules.
It’s the best illustration of a monster with damage reduction; unless charac-
ters have a silver weapon, they’ll have a hard time hurting this creature.
Werewolves are shapechangers, which means players can never be entirely
sure whether that surly villager might indeed be the great black wolf who
attacked their characters out in the forest. And best of all, werewolves carry
the dreaded disease of lycanthropy; those heroes bitten by werewolves may
become werewolves themselves.
5. Ghoul (CR 1)
(Monster Manual page 118)
Ghouls are undead creatures that haunt graveyards and crypts and feast on
the dead . . . or, whenever they’re handy, the living. Ghouls are terrifying to
low-level heroes because one scratch of a ghoul’s filthy claws may cause even
the most resolute of heroes to freeze up in complete (but thankfully short-lived)
paralysis. Fighting off a pack of ghouls requires the heroes to cooperate to
defend friends who are temporarily helpless. And just like the werewolf, the
ghoul’s bite carries with it a supernatural disease that days later might weaken
or kill those who survived the initial encounter.
4. Dire Rat (CR 1/3)
(Monster Manual page 64)
Low-level heroes often find themselves fighting various mundane animals as
well as weird magical creatures or restless undead. Animals such as wolves,
snakes, bears, and tigers are common opponents for beginning heroes, as are
dire animals. Dire animals are animals that are unusually large, powerful, and
foul-tempered versions of the normal creatures you’re familiar with. Dire rats
are the weakest and most common of these vicious animals. A dire rat can be
4 feet long and weigh more than 50 pounds. They’re not terribly tough as far
as monsters go, but they’re rarely found alone; if you meet one, you can bet
that a half-dozen more are somewhere nearby. Dire rats are one of those clas-
sic bits of “dungeon dressing” that just seem to turn up any time you’ve got a
refuse pit, trash heap, or sewer to explore.

Chapter 28: The Ten Best Low-Level Monsters

3. Ogre (CR 3)
(Monster Manual page 198)
The lowest-level giant in the game, an ogre can deliver quite a beating to a
low-level party. An ogre pounds a target for 2d8+7 damage each time it hits
with that big club, an average of 16 points per hit! One swing is usually
enough to kill or incapacitate any 1st-level character, and an ogre that gets a
little lucky can often drop a 3rd- or 4th-level character in one blow. An ogre
teaches players about fighting big, powerful, stupid monsters, which is an
iconic D&D experience. An ogre encounter just screams out for clever player
tactics such as stealth, bluffing, or the use of magic; if characters just go right
at the ogre and try to beat it at its own game of melee damage, they’re going
to get hurt.
2. Skeleton (CR 1/2)
(Monster Manual page 225)
Thanks to Ray Harryhausen, everybody knows just what fighting skeletons
ought to look like. What’s scarier and more fantastic than battling against
silent, remorseless things made from the bodies of the dead? Like the ghoul,
the skeleton introduces players to the special advantages and weaknesses of
undead monsters; they’re immune to the rogue’s sneak attack, they’re immune
to critical hits, but they’re vulnerable to the cleric’s turn undead power. Skele-
tons also show off the damage reduction rules: Because they’re just bone,
they take 5 fewer points of damage from each hit your character scores with
a piercing or slashing weapon. Unless characters are using a bludgeoning
weapon like a club or mace, they’ll find that skeletons are hard to hurt.
1. Orc (CR 1/2)
(Monster Manual page 203)
And the best low-level monster is . . . the orc! The iconic beast-man savage,
the barbaric marauder, bloodthirsty warrior in the service of stronger and
darker evils, the orc is simply the classic adversary for a low-level hero.
To be honest, orcs are actually the top pick because they’re the perfect repre-
sentatives of a broad group of creatures known as humanoids. Monsters like
goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, gnolls, and even lizardfolk all provide a very simi-
lar sort of encounter — the party fights a handful of savage warriors at a time.
356
Part V: The Part of Tens 

They use armor and weapons just like PCs do and may have champions or
leaders who have character classes and use magic like PCs. Some are stronger,
some are sneakier, some are halfling-sized and some are human-sized, but
essentially it’s the same type of encounter regardless of the exact monster
involved.
While orcs are often thought of as low-level opponents, you should remember
that orcs can have classes and levels too. The run-of-the-mill orc is a 1st-level
warrior with poor equipment, but imagine running into an elite orc warband
made up of 5th-level barbarians, or an orc battle-priest who’s an 8th-level
cleric. Now, orcs shouldn’t scale up at the same pace at which your heroes
gain levels; it isn’t fair that your 10th-level heroes find nothing but gangs of
10th-level orcs to fight, when they used to run into gangs of 1st-level orcs.
But it is certainly true that a great orc chieftain and his chief bodyguards
and advisors may be every bit as tough as a high-level party of adventurers.

Chapter 29
The Ten Best Mid-Level Monsters
N
ow for the second half of our Top Monsters list, the ten best monsters
from Challenge Rating 4 to 9. A creature’s Challenge Rating tells you what
level of characters a single monster of that type is a suitable challenge for; for
example, a CR 2 monster is a good challenge for a party of 2nd-level characters.
These creatures are the most suitable for a mid-level game; usually the party
will fight two to three of the lower-CR monsters, or just one of the higher-CR
monsters. As before, we’ve tried to spread out our picks among creatures of
different types and different Challenge Ratings. Every monster also includes
its Challenge Rating (or CR). If you’re a Dungeon Master, you can decide for
yourself whether your players are ready to face these sinister creatures.
10. Hydra (CR 6)
(Monster Manual page 155)
We got down to number 10 and realized we hadn’t chosen a magical beast or
monstrous humanoid for the list. So we picked out the hydra (specifically, a
seven-headed normal hydra) from among many good contenders for this list.
Not only does it carry the banner for the magical beast monster type, it’s also
a representative of Huge-sized monsters. It’s also an example of a monster
that rewards a special tactic — using the Sunder combat action to chop off
its heads, and having another character ready to seal the stump with fire so
that it can’t sprout new heads from the wound.
9. Flesh Golem (CR 7)
(Monster Manual page 135)
Golems are magical constructs, creatures of nonliving matter given animation
through powerful spells and rites. The flesh golem is the most common example
of this monster. It’s made from bits and pieces of bodies, just like Frankenstein’s
monster, but the flesh golem is an unthinking machine. As a construct, a golem
is immune to many special attacks and effects, including sneak attack damage

and critical hits. Better yet, golems specifically enjoy tremendous resistance
to many forms of magic. Unless a player character has the right spell, magic
just won’t affect the flesh golem.
8. Ghost (CR 7)
(Monster Manual page 116)
We really went back and forth between the ghost and the vampire, and we
decided to go with the ghost. The ghost is the perfect example of an incorpo-
real monster — a creature that simply doesn’t have real substance on the
Material Plane, and thus can move through walls, doors, and other obstacles.
Dealing with an incorporeal monster requires players to evolve special tac-
tics and employ specific spells and weapons. Ghosts also have the advantage
of being infinitely configurable. The Ghost entry in the Monster Manual is a
template, which means it’s a package that you add to an existing creature in
order to make a ghostly version of it. The sample ghost given in the Monster
Manual is a 5th-level human fighter.
7. Umber Hulk (CR 7)
(Monster Manual page 248)
Here’s one of our favorites. The umber hulk is an iconic DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
monster — it’s a creature invented specifically for the game, something that
doesn’t really stem from real-world myth or legend. Umber hulks are fun
because they are monsters that use a gaze attack. Just like the ghost teaches
players to deal with incorporeal monsters, the umber hulk teaches players a set
of rules and tactics to overcome a monster that is dangerous to even look at.
6. Beholder (Gauth) (CR 6)
(Monster Manual page 25)
Speaking of iconic creatures, here’s the beholder! What could be more fantas-
tic than a giant floating eyeball with little eye stalks sticking out, all of which
shoot magic rays?
The true beholder is a CR 13 monster, so it’s well out of the range of what we
would consider a mid-level monster. But there’s a lesser version of the beholder
called the gauth, which is only CR 6. The gauth’s eye rays can put hapless PCs
360
Part V: The Part of Tens 

to sleep, damage them, exhaust them, paralyze them, burn them, or dispel
their magic. Oh, and if characters look at the big central eye, they’re subject
to a stunning gaze attack. A gauth is a little fragile for a CR 6 monster, but its
ability to inflict a bewildering variety of damage on the party of heroes is
unparalleled . . . until they fight a true beholder, that is.
5. Mummy (CR 5)
(Monster Manual page 190)
Although creatures such as the ghost or vampire are excellent examples of
undead monsters, they’re also a little difficult to use in the game because they
have a host of special powers. The mummy is an undead monster that’s strong,
scary, interesting, and also easy for a novice DM to run in game play. Its despair
ability can freeze half the party in helpless paralysis as it shambles up to begin
pounding on the heroes, and every hit carries the possibility of passing on
the dreaded disease of mummy rot.
4. Mind Flayer (CR 8)
(Monster Manual page 186)
Another unique creation of the D&D game, the mind flayer is the quintessen-
tial evil genius . . . with the ability to stun PCs into helpless paste with its
mind blast, then pull out their brains and eat them while the PCs are standing
around helplessly watching it happen. If there’s a more horrible way to die in
the D&D game than that, we frankly don’t know what it is. Although a mind
flayer is tremendously dangerous on its own, the real threat posed by the
monster is its ability to mastermind and command other monsters. A mind
flayer is the perfect evil overlord, and it’s clever enough to use its minion
monsters to wear down a group of heroic adventurers before setting a lethal
ambush to finish them off itself.
3. Demon (Vrock) (CR 9)
(Monster Manual page 48)
Demons and devils of all sorts are some of the coolest and most powerful
monsters in the D&D game. There are four or five that we could have picked
to represent the evil-outsider-from-the-infernal-realms niche, but we settled
on the vrock as the best example. The vrock is a dangerous melee combatant,
361
Chapter 29: The Ten Best Mid-Level Monsters

but (like many demons or devils) it also possesses several dangerous spell-like
abilities and special attacks. Many heroes find that they battle demons, devils,
and such things over and over again as they rise to high-level play, and the
vrock is a great representative of the type.
2. Troll (CR 5)
(Monster Manual page 247)
Although we could have gone with a true giant such as a hill giant or a frost
giant for this list, we simply couldn’t pass up the troll. A troll is a great mid-
level monster that can challenge heroes for a number of levels. Just like the
ghost is a great example of an incorporeal monster, the troll is the players’ first
introduction to a regenerating monster — a creature that’s almost impossible
to kill outright unless you’ve got fire handy.
The troll is quite common because it makes a great “meat shield,” or dull-
witted but physically strong creature that can stand in between the heroes
and the evil mastermind. Before the party can get at the evil wizard, mind
flayer, or what-have-you, they’ll have to cut their way through the troll first.
A troll fits well in almost any scenario or monster lair, and it’s vile, repulsive,
and loathsome. Every player loves to hate trolls, and you know what? The
troll deserves it.
1. Young Adult Black Dragon (CR 9)
(Monster Manual page 72)
A dragon isn’t an exceptionally good low-level monster, but for mid-level and
high-level characters, the opportunity to fight a dragon (and pillage its hoard)
is the reason you play the game.
A dragon’s power varies depending on its color (species) and its age category.
The older a dragon gets, the bigger and meaner it gets. A young adult dragon
is a handful for almost any party; we chose the black dragon because the
young adult black dragon is one of the sample dragons provided in the
Monster Manual, and a good fit for the top end of mid-level monsters.
A dragon is armed with a number of dangerous and useful abilities — it flies,
it’s got a great AC and a lot of hit points, it has tremendously good saving
throws and spell resistance, it has a deadly breath weapon (acid, in the case
of a black dragon), and it can tear you to shreds with its claws and teeth. Old
and clever dragons are often potent sorcerers, too.

The Ten Best Dungeon 
Master Resources
E
very Dungeon Master can use a little help now and then. Advice, ideas,
ready-to-play adventures — every DM should look for these nuggets and
horde them like a red dragon hordes treasure.
In this chapter, we examine our Dungeon Mastering libraries and show
you which books we go back to over and over when we’re actively DMing
a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. Each one makes a great addition to your
own library, whether you want to be the Dungeon Master or you just want to
better understand the D&D universe.
(You might notice that there are eleven items on this list of ten. We won’t tell
if you don’t. Consider the discussion of D&D miniatures as an added bonus.)
Dungeon Master’s Guide
By Monte Cook, Skip Williams, and Jonathan Tweet (published by Wizards of
the Coast, Inc.)
One of the three core books that make up the D&D game system (the other
two are the Player’s Handbook and Monster Manual), this volume is packed
with all the tools and advice you need to become a good Dungeon Master. We
constantly refer to this volume while running games, and Chapter 2 (“Using
the Rules”), Chapter 3 (“Adventures”), Chapter 4 (“Nonplayer Characters”),
and Chapter 7 (“Magic Items”) especially get a lot of use. And it’s not just for
Dungeon Masters; players can find useful details in this book as well, such
as the sections on prestige classes and magic items. Make sure you get the
3.5 version of the book, because that’s the most current version. You can
easily spot the “v.3.5” plate right on the front cover.

Monster Manuals
By various authors (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
Dungeon Masters are only as good as the challenges they put before the
adventurers. And D&D challenges usually include monsters of all shapes and
sizes. Make sure, at a minimum, you have the Monster Manual available for
your game. This volume, one of the three core rulebooks (along with the Player’s
Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide), contains the most iconic D&D mon-
sters, including dragons, beholders, mind flayers, orcs, goblins, gelatinous
cubes, and more. When you’re ready to expand your repertoire of creatures,
think about adding Monster Manual II, Monster Manual III, and the Fiend Folio
to your collection. These books don’t just provide more monsters; each of
them adds something new to the lore of the game.
Player’s Handbook
By Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams (published by Wizards of
the Coast, Inc.)
One of the three core books that make up the D&D game system (the other two
are the Dungeon Master’s Guide and Monster Manual), this volume presents
the basic rules of combat and character creation. The DM needs to turn to
this book for the rules of the game, and to know what the players are reading
when they’re away from the gaming table. The lists of skills, feats, and spells
usually see a lot of wear and tear by DMs as they build NPCs and adjudicate
the rules.
FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting
By Ed Greenwood, Sean Reynolds, Skip Williams, and Rob Heinsoo (published
by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
The three core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and
Monster Manual) provide an implied setting for D&D games to take place in.
But the setting gets most of its details from the way the rules work and the
types of characters and equipment presented. There’s no real story or defined
location. Story and location come to the forefront, however, in this campaign
364
Part V: The Part of Tens 

setting, which presents a traditional medieval high-fantasy world designed
specifically for the D&D game system. Whether you want to set your adven-
tures directly in the world of Faerûn, or you want to borrow elements of the
world for your own home-brewed campaign, you’ll find a wealth of informa-
tion and ideas in this volume. This is the most comprehensive fantasy world
ever built, and it is also used as the backdrop of many novels and computer
games. Want to add amazing details to your D&D game? Use this book!
Eberron Campaign Setting
By Keith Baker, Bill Slavicsek, and James Wyatt (published by Wizards of the
Coast, Inc.)
The newest of the D&D campaign settings, EBERRON was created specifically to
take advantage of the newest edition of the D&D rules. Stressing attitude and
tone, this campaign setting highlights action and adventure in medieval fan-
tasy trappings. It’s a little different, a little edgy, but it’s still D&D. Imagine the
movies Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Maltese Falcon, and The Lord of the Rings
film trilogy all woven together. That’s kind of close to the types of adventures
that take place in an EBERRON campaign. Whereas the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign
Setting details the people and places of the world of Faerûn, this book covers
the continents and factions struggling in the world of EBERRON. You can set
your campaign in this world, or you can borrow elements to add to any D&D
campaign. And the book features new races, a new class, new monsters, and
new spells, so check it out.
Deities and Demigods
By Rich Redman, Skip Williams, and James Wyatt (published by Wizards of
the Coast, Inc.)
Every fantasy world needs a pantheon of gods. Whether the gods fill up the
background of the world or strut around on center stage and interact with
the populace, no epic fantasy is complete without them. Plus, clerics need
them as the source of their divine spells. This volume has all kinds of neat
information on using deities in your game, setting up your own pantheons,
and allowing player characters to eventually ascend to godhood if they have
the right stuff. It’s also packed with sample pantheons that are ready to use,
including the legendary D&D hierarchy of gods.
365
Chapter 30: The Ten Best Dungeon Master Resources

Manual of the Planes
By Jeff Grubb, Bruce Cordell, and David Noonan (published by Wizards of the
Coast, Inc.)
In the D&D cosmology, most adventures take place on the Material Plane.
That’s just another way to say the dimension where we keep the world and
all the stuff that goes with it, like sun, and moons, and stars. There are other
dimensions to explore in the fantasy worlds of D&D, however, a vast array of
planes where epic adventures can take place. Many of the most powerful and
strange monsters in the game come from these alternate planes, and it’s only
inevitable that your player characters might want to one day return the favor
and visit other planes of existence. This book is all about exploring elsewhere,
and the ideas it contains can send your campaign in exciting new directions.
Draconomicon
By Andy Collins, Skip Williams, and James Wyatt (published by Wizards of the
Coast, Inc.)
Dragons make up half the name of the game, and this lavish volume presents
them in all their fury and glory. In addition to rules, tactics, and the ecology
of dragons, you’ll find inspiration and adventure ideas on every page of the
book. Dragon lairs, draconic adversaries, legendary treasures, and more leap
from between the gorgeous covers. And, we admit it — we take this book off
the shelf a lot just to look at the wonderful pictures.
Deluxe Dungeon Master’s Screen
(Published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
The DM needs something to hide notes and dice behind, and the DM screen
was designed just for this purpose. One side faces the players and is covered
with great D&D art. The other side features rules summaries and tables that
the DM needs to refer to during play, placed conveniently so you don’t have
to flip through the pages of the books during a tense encounter. We use our
DM screens at every game, and so should you.

Adventures
Some DMs pride themselves on always creating their own adventures for
their games. We applaud those with the creativity and time to take on this
heroic task week after week, but the rest of us need a little help now and
then. Wizards of the Coast publishes adventures that you can use as is or
modify to fit your own campaign. Grab any adventure that appeals to you,
whether it’s set in the campaign world you’re using or not. You can always
make minor adjustments so that it works in whatever world your campaign
takes place in.
Some recent adventures to look for include City of the Spider Queen
(FORGOTTEN REALMS), Shadows of the Last War (EBERRON), and Return to the
Temple of Elemental Evil (D&D). Another great source for adventure content
is Dungeon Magazine, published monthly by Paizo Publishing. It contains
short adventures and adventure hooks that can be modified for use in any
campaign setting.

Chapter 30: The Ten Best Dungeon Master Resources

D&D Miniatures
(Published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
D&D is a game of the imagination, but it works best when you use something
to help you visualize combat in three dimensions. Of course, you can use any
kind of markers with your battle grid, but when we play, we use prepainted
plastic D&D miniatures. Sold in randomly sorted booster packs (though you
can find those willing to sell or trade specific figures online), the line features
monsters and characters drawn from the D&D game books and novels. Our
games are just that much more memorable when we toss a handful of vicious
bugbears on the table, or a large troll, or — gasp! — a huge red dragon that
towers over the figures that represent the player characters. Miniatures give
a sense of scale and help players visualize tactics as combat scenes play out.
We love our miniatures, and so do our players.

The Ten Best Player Resources
P
layers can get away with just using a Player’s Handbook and set of dice,
but there are a whole lot of cool options waiting in other DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS supplements. When we play characters in a D&D game (as opposed
to running games as DMs), we often turn to the books listed in this chapter to
enhance our characters or to try new options and styles of play.
Glance at the titles listed in this chapter and see if any of the topics appeal to
you. If they do, go find the books (check your local game and hobby store if
you can’t find them in a regular bookstore) and give them a read. They’re fun,
interesting, and full of things that will get your creative juices pumping. And
along the way, you just might find that edge that will make your character
better, stronger, and more able to deal with the next challenge your DM
throws your way.
Player’s Handbook
By Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams (published by Wizards of
the Coast, Inc.)
One of the three core books that make up the D&D game system (the other two
are the Dungeon Master’s Guide and Monster Manual), this volume presents
the basic rules of combat and character creation. It contains everything that
players need to create and outfit characters, advance them as they gain levels,
and learn the rules of the game. You’re going to want to refer to this volume a
lot, and perhaps even study it to determine the best way to optimize your
character, so make sure you have your own copy.
Race Series Books
By various authors (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
Every character belongs to a different fantasy race. This series of books
explores the intricacies of the core D&D races, and each volume presents
a new player character race that you can try out. Races of Stone features

dwarves, gnomes, and the new goliath race. Races of the Wild showcases
elves, halflings, and the new raptoran race. Races of Destiny explores the lives
of humans, half-elves, half-orcs, and the new illumians race. Races of Eberron
examines the new races presented in the Eberron Campaign Setting and shows
how they can be used in any D&D game, including shifters, changelings,
kalashtar, and warforged. Grab the volumes that focus on the races you like
to play, or the races you might want to play in future games.
Deluxe Player Character Sheets
(Published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
These four-page character sheet folios, beautifully printed and set up for the
different character classes, are the perfect way to keep track of your charac-
ter’s statistics, abilities, and possessions. No player should pass up the chance
to use these premier character sheets.
Hero Series Books
By various authors (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
Every character class brings something different to the table. This series of
books explores the advantages of the core D&D races, presents new class
options, and shows how to make your character grow in new and exciting
ways. Complete Warrior provides martial options that can be used by all
classes, though it really speaks to characters with combat-oriented classes,
such as the fighter, barbarian, paladin, and ranger. Complete Arcane opens up
arcane magic to all classes, focusing on new options for arcane spellcasting
classes such as the sorcerer and wizard. Complete Divine provides divine magic
options for all classes, focusing on the primary divine spellcasters, clerics and
druids. Complete Adventurer explores skill and feat use for all classes while
providing new options especially geared toward rogues, bards, and monks.
Expanded Psionics Handbook
By Bruce Cordell (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
If the D&D game had a fourth core rulebook, this would be it. While it may
not be for everyone, the Expanded Psionics Handbook adds a new system of
special effects to the game — the powers of the mind. Consider this to be a
third type of magic, though psionics isn’t exactly magic in the sense of the
370
Part V: The Part of Tens 

traditional arcane and divine magic described in the core rulebooks. But if
you want to play a class or a race with access to a wide variety of mental
powers, check out this volume. Psionic classes include the psion and the psy-
chic warrior. The half-giant, githyanki, and thri-kreen are examples of races
with psionic tendencies. Psionic powers include ego whip (a lashing mental
assault that reduces a target’s Charisma score) and mind probe (which allows
a character to explore a target’s memories for the answer to a question).
Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting
By Ed Greenwood, Sean Reynolds, Skip Williams, and Rob Heinsoo (published
by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
The three core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and
Monster Manual) provide an implied setting for D&D games to take place in.
But the setting gets most of its details from the way the rules work and the
types of characters and equipment presented. There’s no real story or defined
location. Story and location come to the forefront, however, in this campaign
setting, which presents a traditional medieval, high-fantasy world designed
specifically for the D&D game system. If your D&D group is using this setting,
then this volume gives you insight into the world of Faerûn and all its wonders.
There may be parts of this book that your DM asks you not to read, or at least
to keep as player knowledge instead of character knowledge — at least until
after the facts become revealed through the course of play. Still, with new
feats, spells, and other character options, this volume is indispensable to
players using this setting.
Eberron Campaign Setting
By Keith Baker, Bill Slavicsek, and James Wyatt (published by Wizards of the
Coast, Inc.)
The newest of the D&D campaign settings, EBERRON was created specifically to
take advantage of the newest edition of the D&D rules. Stressing attitude and
tone, this campaign setting highlights action and adventure in medieval fan-
tasy trappings. It’s a little different, a little edgy, but it’s still D&D. Whereas
the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting details the people and places of the
world of Faerûn, this book covers the continents and factions struggling in
the world of EBERRON. Players can gain lots of insight into the world and make
use of the various character class, race, spell, and feat options available. As
with the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, there are parts of this book that
your DM may ask you to ignore or treat only as player knowledge until that
information is revealed during the game.

Your character needs to be prepared for anything and should always have
access to the right tool for the job. That’s where this collection of armor,
weapons, adventuring gear, trade goods, alchemical potions, mounts, and
vehicles comes in. With this book and enough gold pieces, your character
can get outfitted for any situation.
Weapons of Legacy
By Bruce Cordell, Kolja Raven Liquette, and Travis Stout (published by
Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This is the ultimate guide to magic items and weapons of heritage, including
rules for improving weapons and armor as your character gains levels and
experience. Why use a simple +1 longsword when you can wield Excalibur?
This volume tells you how.
Epic Level Handbook
By Andy Collins, Bruce Cordell, and Thomas Reid (published by Wizards of
the Coast, Inc.)
Ever wonder what happens after your character reaches 20th level and
beyond? This comprehensive volume explores what happens when charac-
ters transcend the boundaries of the Player’s Handbook and enter the realm

Chapter 32
The Ten Best D&D Novels
A
s much fun as the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is to play, you can’t spend
all of your time adventuring in the dungeons. That doesn’t mean you
still can’t get your fill of D&D when you’re away from the gaming table.
In this chapter, we look at one of the best out-of-game activities you can par-
ticipate in while still staying in the spirit of D&D — reading D&D-based fantasy
novels. Wizards of the Coast publishes a vast array of novels set in the various
worlds of D&D, and we introduce you to some of the best out there in this
chapter. In addition, we suggest some other fantasy novels that, while not
specifically related to D&D, are definitely in the spirit of the game and can
inspire players and DMs alike in future game sessions.
Dragonlance Chronicles
By Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This is the trilogy that launched the D&D novels lines, and it holds up today as
an epic adventure revolving around a group of adventuring companions not
unlike the characters you and your friends play in any D&D game. The epic
struggle of the War of the Lance unfolds through Dragons of Autumn Twilight,
Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning. Many of the charac-
ters and situations introduced in these volumes spin off into new adventures
throughout the line of DRAGONLANCE novels.
Dragonlance Legends
By Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This sequel to Chronicles, Legends explores events in the lives of two popular
characters — Raistlin and Caramon. Follow Caramon through time as he
struggles to save his brother from a terrible darkness in Time of the Twins,
War of the Twins, and Test of the Twins.

Icewind Dale Trilogy
By R.A. Salvatore (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
In this thrilling adventure set in the far northern reaches of the FORGOTTEN
REALMS setting, you first meet the popular dark elf hero Drizzt Do’urden and
his companions. With The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling’s
Gem, a powerful tale unfolds and sets the stage for the future adventures of
the drow ranger and his friends.
R.A. Salvatore’s War of the Spider Queen
By various authors (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This epic story evolves across five books as civil war and chaos rocks the
Underdark. As the most powerful dark elf houses clash in this tale set in the
FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign’s shadow regions, four heroes seek to save the
underworld realm of Menzoberranzan from a terrible, approaching darkness.
This series consists of these titles: Dissolution, Insurrection, Condemnation,
Extinction, and Annihilation.
Knights of the Silver Dragon
By various authors (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
A series of D&D stories written for readers who are ages 8 to 12, it follows the
adventures of three children striving to earn their way into the prestigious
and honorable Order of the Knights of the Silver Dragon. It’s a great way to
introduce younger readers to the worlds of D&D. Titles in the series include
Secret of the Spiritkeeper, Riddle in Stone, and The Hidden Dragon.
The City of Towers
By Keith Baker (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
Set in the world of EBERRON, The City of Towers takes place in the magical city
of Sharn. Here, four veterans of the Last War are caught up in a plot that
involves murder, intrigue, and corruption at the highest levels of power in the
city. This novel is a great read and a good introduction to the world of EBERRON.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Temple of Elemental Evil
By Thomas M. Reid (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
One of the most popular DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventures of all time comes
alive in this gripping tale of dark magic and ancient evil. As a demon struggles
to escape captivity and an evil demigod works to gain control over the foul
creature, a band of desperate heroes must enter the cursed temple and find a
way to save the world.
The Hunter’s Blades Trilogy
By R.A. Salvatore (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
In the latest adventures of Drizzt Do’urden, hero of the far northern reaches
of the FORGOTTEN REALMS world, the dark elf takes a stand to stop the spread of
chaos and war across his adopted homeland. Fans of Drizzt will thoroughly
enjoy this series, which includes The Thousand Orcs, The Lone Drow, and
The Two Swords.
The Year of Rogue Dragons
By Richard Lee Byers (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This series of FORGOTTEN REALMS novels explores the ancient secrets of drag-
ons and dragon society. Covering a tale that’s integral to the current timeline
(the age of Faerûn in which the current edition of the campaign setting takes
place), the story deals with events on a draconic scale. Titles in this series
include The Rage and The Rite.
The Savage Caves
By T.H. Lain (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
The first in a series of D&D action/adventure tales that feature the iconic
heroes of the roleplaying game — including Regdar and Lidda! Other titles in
this line of novels include The Living Dead, City of Fire, and Plague of Ice.

not be official D&D novels, but they’re certainly
in the same spirit, and many of these books
inspired our earliest attempts at story and adven-
ture creation. This list is by no means complete
or exhaustive. Consider it as a starting point for
your own discovery of novels to inspire you and
fuel your imagination:

Glossary
5-foot step: A small adjustment of up to one square in any direction. A 5-foot
step doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity, so it’s a good way to maneuver
around a foe in a fight (or to back away from a foe and give your character
room to cast a spell or use a ranged weapon safely).
aberration: A monster type, which includes creatures such as the aboleth,
chuul, and umber hulk.
ability: One of the six basic physical and mental attributes of a character or
creature: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
Each ability is given a numerical value (usually between 3 and 18 for a beginning
human character). For example, your character might have a Strength score
of 15, a Dexterity score of 12, an Intelligence score of 9, and so on. Monsters
have ability scores, too, and sometimes they can be way above (or below)
character scores. For example, a giant or dragon might have a Strength score
as high as 35 or 40!
ability check: A test or check in which you roll 1d20 and then add the ability
modifier for the appropriate ability to the resulting roll. For example, breaking
down a door is usually a Strength check, and a cleric’s turn undead check is a
Charisma check.
ability modifier: The bonus or penalty your character gets for having a good
or poor ability score. For example, a character with a Strength score of 15 has
a modifier of +2 on Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, melee attack
rolls, and melee damage rolls.
action, full-round: Some special actions taken in combat require a whole turn.
Examples include making a full attack or charge attack. You may be able to
take a 5-foot step in addition to your full-round action.
action, move: Moving up to your character’s speed is a move action. You can
take one move action and one standard action in your turn, or you can take
two move actions. Move actions also cover a number of unrelated activities
such as standing up after being knocked prone or drawing a weapon. 
action, standard: Most specific things your character can do in a combat sit-
uation are standard actions. Examples include casting a spell, using a magic
item, or making a melee attack. You can take one standard action and one
move action in your turn.

alignment: A basic description of the morality of an intelligent creature, as
follows: lawful good (LG), lawful neutral (LN), lawful evil (LE), neutral evil (NE),
chaotic evil (CE), chaotic neutral (CN), chaotic good (CG), neutral good (NG),
or neutral (N).
animal: A monster type that includes mundane creatures such as lions,
tigers, and bears, as well as dire animals, dinosaurs, and giant animals.
arcane spell: A spell cast by a bard, sorcerer, or wizard.
arcane spell failure chance: The chance that a spell fails (that is, the spell
is cast to no effect) because the caster was hampered by wearing armor.
The heavier the armor, the bigger chance you have of arcane spell failure. 
Armor Class (AC): A number representing a creature’s ability to avoid being
hit in combat. An opponent’s attack roll must equal or exceed the target’s AC
to hit it. Armor Class starts at 10, and is then modified for a creature’s size,
Dexterity, armor worn, natural armor (tough hide, scales, or thick fur), and
magical protections.
attack of opportunity: A single extra melee attack that a combatant may make
when an opponent within reach takes an action that provokes an attack of
opportunity, such as casting a spell or firing a ranged weapon.
attack roll: A roll to determine whether an attack hits. To make an attack roll,
roll 1d20 and add appropriate modifiers for your character’s base attack bonus,
size modifier (if any), Strength or Dexterity modifier (depending on whether
this is a melee or ranged attack), plus any special modifiers that might apply,
such as the Weapon Focus feat or a masterwork or magic weapon. If the result
equals or beats the target’s AC, your character hits.
barbarian (Bbn): A player character class. Barbarians are ferocious warriors
who use fury and feral instinct to defeat their foes.
bard (Brd): A player character class. Bards are jacks-of-all-trades who fight
well, master many skills, and know some magic. Bards can create magical
effects with music and poetry.
base attack bonus (BAB): A basic measure of fighting skill derived from char-
acter class and level. For example, a 4th-level fighter has a base attack bonus
of +4, but a 4th-level sorcerer only has a base attack bonus of +2.
base save bonus: A basic measure of resistance to various special attacks
such as spells or breath weapons, derived from character class and level.
For example, a 4th-level fighter has base save bonuses of +4 Fort, +1 Ref,
and +1 Will, but a 4th-level sorcerer has base save bonuses of +1 Fort, +1 Ref,
and +4 Will.
378
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

buff: To use magic to make your character or allies stronger or better. For exam-
ple, if your character casts bull’s strength on a fighter buddy, your character is
buffing him or her for a fight.
bull rush: A special combat maneuver in which your character tries to shove
an opponent out of the way. It’s useful for forcing your way through a defended
doorway or pushing somebody into a pit.
cast a spell: The shaping of magical or divine energy to create a specific effect
by means of words, gestures, or special materials. Only characters of certain
classes can cast spells (see spellcaster).
caster level (CL): A measure of the power with which a character casts a spell;
caster level is the same as the character’s level in that spellcasting class. Many
spells hit harder or deal more damage when cast by a higher-level character.
For example, fireball cast by a 5th-level sorcerer (caster level 5) deals 5d6 fire
damage, but fireball cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (caster level 8) deals 8d6
fire damage.
caster level check: A roll of 1d20 + your character’s caster level. If the result
equals or exceeds the difficulty class (DC), the check succeeds. Caster level
checks are most common performed when a character is fighting a monster
that has spell resistance (or SR). If the check is successful, the spell works;
otherwise, it fails outright.
casting time: The time required to cast a spell, usually either one standard
action or one round. To cast a spell with a casting time of one round, you
start on your turn and finish the spell immediately before your next turn.
character: A fictional individual in the game setting, created and controlled
by a player or DM. (See player character (PC) and nonplayer character (NPC).)
character class: One of the 11 player character types or careers — barbarian,
bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard.
Class defines a character’s talents and basic function in the game.
character level: A character’s total level. For a character with more than one
class (see multiclass), character level is equal to the sum of all class levels.
charge: A special combat maneuver in which a character moves up to double
his or her speed and makes a melee attack at the end with a +2 attack bonus.
It’s good for covering distance to a foe and hitting him or her in the same turn.
check: A method of determining whether your character succeeds or fails
when attempting an action. Most checks are either ability checks or skill
checks. To make a check, roll 1d20 and add any relevant modifiers. If this
result equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class number assigned by the DM, the
check succeeds.
379
Glossary

class: See character class.
class feature: Any special ability, power, or characteristic derived from
having levels in a character class.
class level: A character’s level in a single class. For multiclass characters, class
features generally depend on class level, not character level. (See multiclass
and character level.)
class skill: A skill to which characters of a particular class have easier access
than characters of other classes. You can buy class skills at the rate of one rank
per skill point, and the maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.
cleric (Clr): A player character class. Clerics are holy crusaders who cast
divine spells, wield special power over the undead, and fight well.
command undead: The supernatural ability of evil clerics and some neutral
clerics to control undead creatures by channeling negative energy.
concealment: An obscurity that prevents a character from clearly seeing a
target. Concealment creates a chance (also known as a miss chance) that an
otherwise successful attack misses.
concentrate on a spell: Concentrating to maintain an active spell’s effect.
Most spells don’t require your character to concentrate.
confirm: Table talk for a critical roll made to determine if a critical threat
results in a critical hit or normal hit. For example, “I rolled a natural 20, that’s
a threat. I confirm the crit with a roll of 23.” (See critical hit and critical roll.)
construct: A monster type which includes things that were built and ani-
mated through magic, such as flesh golems or shield guardians. Constructs
are immune to many attacks and effects.
copper piece (cp): A unit of currency in the game. Copper pieces are worth
1⁄100 of a gold piece.
coup de grace: A full-round action that allows your character to attempt a
killing blow against a helpless opponent. (Coup de grace is French for “stroke
of mercy.”)
cover: Any barrier between an attacker and defender. Cover grants the
defender a bonus to AC.
creature: A living or otherwise active being. The terms “creature,” “monster,”
and “character” are sometimes used interchangeably.
380
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

crit: Table talk for a critical hit (or, as a verb, the act of clobbering someone
or something with a critical hit). For example, “Did you just crit that orc?”
critical hit: A hit that strikes a vital area. To score a critical hit, you must first
score a threat (usually by rolling a natural 20 on an attack roll, but some
weapons threaten a crit with a natural roll of 19 or 20, or even an 18, 19, or 20),
and then succeed on a critical roll (just like another attack roll). Crits usually
deal double damage, but some weapons deal triple or even quadruple damage.
critical roll: A special second attack roll made in the event of a critical threat
to determine whether a critical hit has been scored. If the critical roll is a hit
against the target creature’s AC, then the original attack roll is a critical hit.
If the critical roll misses, then the original attack roll is just a normal hit.
cross-class skill: A skill that is not a class skill for a character. Characters may
buy cross-class skills at the rate of 1⁄2 rank per skill point (or one rank per two
skill points). The most ranks you can have in a cross-class skill is one-half of
the class skill maximum (3 + character level).
cure spell: Any spell with the word “cure” in its name, such as cure minor
wounds, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, or
cure critical wounds. Cure spells instantly restore hit points lost to damage.
damage: A decrease in hit points, an ability score, or other aspects of a 
character. The three main categories of damage are lethal damage, nonlethal
damage, and ability damage. The exact type of damage is often specified so
that you can determine whether the target has any special resistances or
immunities that may decrease or negate the damage. For example, if your
character casts a scorching ray spell dealing 16 points of fire damage at a
creature with fire resistance 10, the target only suffers 6 points of damage.
damage reduction (DR): A special defense that allows a creature to ignore a
set amount of damage from each hit. DR doesn’t protect a creature from energy
attacks, spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural attacks. Many types of
damage reduction can be bypassed with the right weapon; for example, a
werewolf with DR 10/silver takes 10 points off the damage dealt by any hit,
but a silver weapon ignores this defense and deals full damage.
darkvision: The ability to see in total darkness. Many monsters have dark-
vision, as do races such as dwarves and half-orcs.
difficulty class (DC): The target number that you must meet or beat with a
skill check or saving throw roll to succeed.
dispel: Negate, suppress, or remove one or more existing spells or effects on
a creature, item, or area. Dispel usually refers to the dispel magic spell.
381
Glossary

dispel check: A roll of 1d20 + caster level of the character making the attempt
to dispel. The DC is 11 + the level of the spellcaster who initiated the effect
being dispelled.
divine spell: A spell cast by a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger.
domain: A granted power and set of nine divine spells (one each of 1st through
9th level) representing a cleric’s area of special interest. A cleric chooses two
domains at 1st level and keeps them throughout his or her career.
domain spell: A divine spell belonging to a domain. In addition to the normal
daily complement of spells, a cleric can cast one domain spell per day for
each spell level his or her caster level allows. Because a cleric has two
domains, you can choose level-by-level which domain spell to prepare at
each spell level your character can cast.
double weapon: A weapon with two ends, blades, or heads. Double weapons
can be used to make an extra attack as if your character was fighting with
two weapons.
dragon: A monster type that includes true dragons (such as the black, red,
copper, gold, and blue dragons) and dragon-like monsters such as wyverns.
druid (Drd): A player character class. Druids are divine spellcasters who
draw their powers from the natural world and gain the ability to take on
animal forms as they gain levels.
Dungeon Master (DM): The player who runs the game for the other players.
The DM creates the dungeons and lands the PCs explore, decides what sort
of monsters or challenges the PCs must overcome, controls the monsters
when they battle the adventurers, and referees the game.
elemental: A monster type made up of creatures that embody the elements
of air, earth, fire, or water. Elementals can be summoned by summon monster
spells, and they are immune to many attacks and effects.
energy drain: An attack that saps vital energy, giving your character negative
levels. Each negative level gives your character a –1 penalty on attack rolls,
saving throws, and checks, and wipes out one spell slot. Negative levels can
become permanent level loss.
ethereal: On or from the Ethereal Plane. An ethereal creature is invisible and
intangible to creatures on the Material Plane (the “real world” in the D&D
game). As such, the creature is capable of moving through solid objects on
the Material Plane. Spells such as ethereal jaunt allow characters to briefly
become ethereal.
382
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

experience points (XP): A measure of your character’s personal achievement
and advancement. Your character earns XP by defeating monsters and over-
coming challenges. Characters continue to accumulate experience points
throughout their careers, gaining new levels in their character class at certain
experience point totals.
fey: A monster type that includes nature spirits or creatures with similar
mystic origins, such as the dryad, nymph, or satyr.
fighter (Ftr): A player character class. Fighters have exceptional combat abili-
ties and skills with weapons.
flank: To be directly on the other side of an opponent who is being threatened
by another ally. A flanking attacker gains a +2 flanking bonus on attack rolls
against the flanked opponent. A rogue can sneak attack a defender that he or
she is flanking.
flat-footed: Not yet on guard or ready for trouble. Characters always begin a
battle flat-footed, and remain so until they take their first turns in the fight.
A flat-footed creature loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and can’t make
attacks of opportunity.
Fortitude (Fort) save: A type of saving throw. Fort saves generally apply to
things a character resists through sheer physical stamina, such as surviving
the effects of a poison.
giant: A monster type made up of big, strong humanoid-shaped creatures,
such as ogres, trolls, and true giants.
gish: Table talk for a character who is a multiclass fighter/wizard.
gold piece (gp): The standard unit of currency in the D&D game.
grapple: A special attack or tactic in which a character tries to grab and wres-
tle an opponent. First, your character has to grab the foe (a touch attack that
provokes an attack of opportunity). Then you make a grapple check against
your opponent’s grapple check. If you equal or beat your opponent’s result,
your character has him or her grappled.
grapple check: An opposed check that determines your character’s ability to
struggle in a grapple. A grapple check is equal to 1d20 + base attack bonus +
Strength modifier + a special size modifier (–4 if you’re playing a Small-sized
character, or +4 if your character is Large-sized).
grappling: Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle.
When characters are grappling, they’re limited to a much smaller choice of
actions than normal.
383
Glossary

hit: Make a successful attack roll, as in, “My attack’s a 27, did I hit?”
Hit Die/Hit Dice (HD): The die or dice rolled to determine how many hit points
your character has. For example, a 4th-level fighter has 4d10 Hit Dice, so that
character has between 4 and 40 hit points (before adding any Con modifier to
each Hit Die). Hit Dice are based on your character’s level and class. Hit Dice
also serve as a measure of power that determines how vulnerable a character
is to certain spells or effects.
hit points (hp): A measure of your character’s health. Damage that characters
take decreases their current hit points. Lost hit points are restored either by
magical healing (by taking a potion of cure light wounds, for example), or by
natural healing (which requires that the character rest for a certain number
of days).
humanoid: A monster type made up of creatures that are very humanlike,
such as dwarves, elves, goblins, and orcs.
incorporeal: Having no physical body. Some monsters such as ghosts and
shadows are incorporeal. Incorporeal monsters are immune to all nonmagical
attack forms.
inflict spell: Any spell with the word “inflict” in its name, such as inflict light
wounds, inflict moderate wounds, and so on.
initiative: A system for determining the sequence of actions during a battle.
Before the first round of combat, each combatant makes a single initiative
check. Each round, everyone acts in order from the highest initiative result to
the lowest. Usually, you just use your first initiative roll for the whole fight.
initiative check: A check used to determine your place in the initiative order
for a combat. An initiative check is 1d20 + Dexterity modifier + any special
modifiers your character may have.
known spell: A spell that an arcane spellcaster has learned and can use. For
wizards, knowing a spell means having it in their spellbooks. For sorcerers
and bards, knowing a spell means that they selected it to be part of their
repertoire.
level: A measure of advancement or power applied to both characters
(for example, a 10th-level fighter) and spells (such as a 4th-level spell).
light weapon: A weapon suitable for use in your character’s off (or second)
hand, such as a dagger.
384
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

low-light vision: The ability to see better than a human in conditions of dim
illumination. Creatures such as elves and giants have low-light vision.
magical beast: A monster type made up of creatures with magical forms or
powers, such as displacer beasts, gorgons, and ropers.
masterwork: Exceptionally well-made weapons or armor. Masterwork weapons
give a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Magical weapons and armor are
always masterwork.
Material Plane: The “normal” plane of existence; the “real world” for D&D
characters, as opposed to outer planes like the Nine Hells or Pandemonium.
(See plane.)
melee: Combat at close range, in which combatants are trading jabs, thrusts,
slams, or slashes with melee weapons or natural weapons.
melee touch attack: An attack roll made in melee in which characters are just
trying to touch foes (usually so that they can deliver a spell of some kind).
Because this kind of attack merely requires contact with the target, it ignores
bonus to AC granted by armor, a shield, or natural armor.
monk (Mnk): A player character class. Monks are masters of the martial arts
and have a number of exotic powers.
monstrous humanoid: A monster type made up of creatures that are only
vaguely humanoid in form, such as centaurs, minotaurs, and medusas.
multiclass: A character advancement strategy in which you choose to add
levels from a different class than the one your character started off in. For
example, if you begin with a 1st-level fighter, when your character reaches
2nd level, your character can become a 2nd-level fighter — or your character
can multiclass and become a 1st-level fighter/1st-level rogue, or 1st-level fighter/
1st-level sorcerer, or whatever.
natural weapon: Teeth, claws, horns, tails, tentacles, and other such
appendages that animals and monsters use as weapons.
nonlethal damage: Some attacks deal nonlethal damage instead of normal
damage. When characters accumulate nonlethal damage in excess of their
current hit points, they’re knocked out. Unarmed attacks (punches, kicks, and
so on) and grappling deal nonlethal damage, and characters or creatures can
take a –4 penalty on an attack roll with a normal weapon to deal nonlethal
damage instead of normal damage.
385
Glossary

nonplayer character (NPC): A character controlled by the DM. NPCs can be
any of the people your character meets (such as innkeepers, merchants, and
the rich noble that asked the party to retrieve a lost or stolen heirloom), as
well as the villains or rivals your character encounters (such as evil clerics,
sorcerers, rogues, and fighters). 
ooze: A monster type made up of mindless, amorphous blobs such as the
gray ooze or black pudding.
outsider: A monster type made up of powerful supernatural creatures from
other planes of existence, such as demons and devils.
paladin (Pal): A player character class. Paladins are holy warriors who are
champions of justice and good.
plane: A different realm or layer of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of
Air, the Nine Hells, the Ethereal Plane, or Arborea.
plant: A monster type made up of plant monsters, such as treants or sham-
bling mounds. Plants are immune to many attacks and effects.
platinum piece (pp): A unit of currency equal to 10 gold pieces.
player character (PC): A character controlled by one of the players at the
table, as opposed to the DM. Your character is your avatar in the game.
potion: A magic item that’s basically a one-shot spell effect that any character
can use.
prerequisite: A condition or requirement that must be met before your char-
acter can get something. For example, the Cleave feat has Strength 13 and
Power Attack as prerequisites — you can’t take Cleave until your character
has learned the Power Attack feat.
psionics: Special mental powers and attacks that some monsters and charac-
ters can use. If your DM isn’t using the psionics rules in the game, psionics
work the same as spell-like abilities. 
race: A character’s species or kind. Race determines a character’s general
size and looks, and it also grants special bonuses and/or negatives to skills
and ability scores. For example, if you’re playing a 3rd-level elf rogue, your
character’s race is “elf.”
range increment: A measure of how far a missile weapon or thrown weapon
can attack without penalty. For example, a weapon with a range increment
of 80 feet suffers no attack penalty when used against targets within 80 feet,
a –2 penalty from 81–160 feet, a –4 penalty from 161–240 feet, and so on.
386
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

ranger (Rgr): A player character class. Rangers are skilled warriors of the
wilderness who specialize in defeating certain favored enemies.
reach: The ability to make a melee attack against someone who isn’t standing
right next to you. Big monsters have natural reach; human-sized characters
can get reach by choosing long weapons such as longspears.
Reflex (Ref) save: A type of saving throw related to your character’s ability to
avoid a threat through agility and quickness.
rogue (Rog): A player character class. Rogues are nimble characters who
excel at using skills and making sneak attacks.
round: A single unit of game time, especially in battles. A round represents
6 seconds in the game world (but it might take a lot longer than that to
resolve every character and monster action in a single round).
saving throw (save): A roll made to avoid or lessen the effects of a special
attack, such as a spell or monster ability. The three types of saving throws
are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.
scroll: A magic item that’s basically a one-shot use of a single specific spell.
For example, a scroll of invisibility lets your character cast the spell invisibility
one time. Characters can only use scrolls that have spells on their class spell
list, and if the spell is too high-level for them to cast normally, they’ll have to
make a caster level check to pull it off.
silver piece (sp): A unit of currency equal to 1⁄10 of a gold piece.
sorcerer (Sor): A player character class. Sorcerers are fragile (they have low
hit points) and don’t fight well, but they wield powerful arcane spells.
spell: A one-time magical effect. Spells are organized into spell lists keyed to
each spellcasting character class and by spell level; higher-level spells are
more powerful than lower-level spells.
spellcaster: Any character or creature that has the ability to cast a spell. Bards,
clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards are primarily spellcasters; paladins and
rangers do not begin as spellcasters, but gain the ability to cast spells once
they gain a few levels.
spell-like ability: The ability to generate a spell without actually casting it.
Powerful supernatural monsters may have a number of spell-like abilities,
which work much like spells cast by a character.
387
Glossary

spell resistance (SR): A special defensive ability that makes a creature or
character hard to affect with spells. In order for an enemy to affect your char-
acter with a spell, he or she has to make a caster level check, with your char-
acter’s SR value as the DC. Some spells work regardless of spell resistance.
spontaneous casting: The ability of a cleric to drop a prepared spell in order
to instantly cast a cure or inflict spell in its place. Druids can use spontaneous
casting to drop a spell and instead cast a summon nature’s ally spell.
stack: Combine multiple bonuses for a cumulative effect. Usually, you only
get the best bonus of any given type that applies, but if you gain bonuses of
several different types, they’ll all work together. For example, a bless spell
gives a character a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, but a prayer spells gives
a character a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls; these two effects stack, so a char-
acter has a total of a +2 bonus on attack rolls when under the effect of both
spells at once.
take 10: Instead of risking a bad roll on some skill checks, you can simply
state that you want to “take 10.” This gives you a result as if you’d rolled a
10 on your 1d20 roll, plus whatever modifiers apply. You can only take 10
when your character is not being threatened or distracted; the DM has the
final say on whether you can take 10 in any given situation or check.
take 20: If you don’t care about time, you can “take 20” on some skills or
checks. This gives you a result as if you’d rolled a 20 on your 1d20 roll, plus
whatever modifiers apply. You can only take 20 if your character is not faced
with any threats or distractions; if the skill he or she is trying to use carries
no penalties for failure (such as falling off a cliff he or she is trying to climb);
and if he or she has at least two minutes to make the skill attempt (for a skill
that normally takes a single action to attempt). The DM has the final say on
whether you can take 20 in any given situation or check.
threaten: The area characters or creatures can attack in melee without moving
from their current positions. Usually, creatures threaten all squares adjacent
to them. If an enemy in a square your character threatens takes an action that
provokes an attack of opportunity, your character can get an attack even when
it isn’t your turn.
turn undead: The supernatural ability of a cleric to drive off or destroy mon-
sters of the undead type.
two-handed weapon: A weapon designed for use in two hands, such as a
greatsword. A character can’t use a two-handed weapon and at the same
time fight with a light weapon in his or her off hand or use a shield.
388
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies 

unarmed strike: An attack made by a character or creature without a weapon.
(Most animals and monsters have natural weapons such as claws or teeth, and
therefore aren’t considered “unarmed”; they don’t make attacks of this type.)
When your character makes an unarmed attack, he or she provokes an attack
of opportunity from his or her foe and deals nonlethal damage on a successful
hit. Monks have a special ability to make unarmed strikes without provoking
attacks of opportunity and can deal lethal or nonlethal damage as they choose.
undead: A monster type made up of things that used to be alive and that died
but won’t stay buried. Examples include ghosts, ghouls, vampires, skeletons,
and wraiths. Undead are immune to many attacks and effects.
vermin: A monster type made up of giant bugs, such as monstrous spiders or
monstrous scorpions.
wand: A type of magic item. A wand lets your character cast one specific spell
up to 50 times, depending on how many charges it has in it (new wands always
begin with 50 charges). Characters have to have the spell in question on their
class’s spell list to use a wand (so characters without spell lists generally can’t
use wands at all).
Will save: A type of saving throw. Will saves test your character’s ability to
withstand ill effects through mental strength and willpower.
wizard (Wiz): A player character class. Like sorcerers, wizards tend to be
physically frail, but they wield powerful arcane spells.
