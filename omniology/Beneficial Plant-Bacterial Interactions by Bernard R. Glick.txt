Preface
In recent years there has been considerable interest in studies involving plant 
growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and their interaction with plants. This interest 
is derived from the notion (hope) that these bacteria will eventually be used on a 
large scale in sustainable agricultural practice. In addition, the successful imple-
mentation of PGPB may enable them to partially, or even completely, replace the 
current excessive use of chemicals in agriculture. In fact, given the ever-increasing 
understanding of many of the fundamental biochemical and genetic mechanisms 
that are operative in plant–bacterial interactions, there is every reason to expect 
that we are on the verge of a new paradigm in agriculture where we are able to uti-
lize this technology worldwide on a practical and large scale. Of course, for PGPB 
technology to continue to develop to realize its full potential, it is imperative that 
the fundamental research in this field continues unabated.
In the last 5–10 years, there have been a relatively large number of books deal-
ing with various aspects of the interaction between plants and microorganisms. 
Nearly all of these books have been written by groups of specialists in this field 
and are intended for burgeoning practitioners. On the other hand, this book was 
written to serve as a textbook (guidebook) for a one-semester undergraduate or 
graduate course in Plant–Microbe Interactions. It is based on a course that has been 
offered at the University of Waterloo for the past number of years and attempts 
to present a broad, although admittedly biased, perspective of this area. The 
book assumes some basic knowledge of Microbiology, Plant Biology, Molecular 
Biology and Biochemistry. This notwithstanding, not everyone who uses this book 
will have had an extensive background in all of the above-mentioned disciplines. 
Therefore, this book is intentionally written in a jargon-free style in which as much

of the background as is necessary to understand the major concepts is provided. 
The book should therefore be useful to anyone who is interested in developing a 
relatively broad fundamental perspective on plant–microbe interactions.

1.1  The Problem
The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834) was a British cleric and scholar 
who became widely known for his theories about changes in the world’s popula-
tion. He promulgated the idea that “The power of population is ­indefinitely greater 
than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.” That is, Malthus 
understood that sooner or later, the earth, which is finite, would be unable to pro-
duce enough food to feed all of the people who live here. Malthus’ thinking was 
in direct opposition to the view that was popular in eighteenth-century Europe that 
society would continue to improve and was in principle “perfectible.” Of course, 
neither Malthus nor any of his critics could have possibly predicted the enormous 
technological changes, including changes to agricultural and food storage technolo-
gies, that have taken place over the past 150–200 years. These changes have ena-
bled the world’s population to expand dramatically in a relatively short period of 
time. However, these technological changes may have lulled us into a sense of false 
security whereby many people in society, especially in more developed countries, 
believe that we have never had it so good, and as long as our policies continue to 
support innovation and business expansion, the good life will continue on well into 
the future. Unfortunately, at this juncture, the threat of insufficient food to feed all of 
the world’s people is once again in the headlines. This is a result of a continuously 
growing world’s population, worldwide climate change, food spoilage and wastage 
on an enormous scale, the unequal distribution of food resources around the world, 
and the over use of energy-intensive agricultural chemicals (Fig. 1.1).
At the present time, there are around 7 billion people in the world (Fig. 1.2), 
up from approximately 2.5 billion in 1950 and around 1 billion in the early 1800s, 
and is predicted to rise to somewhere around 9.5  billion by 2050. That is, the 
increase in the world’s population in the next 35 or so years will be approximately 
equal to the number of people in the world in 1950. Put another way, within a

period of just 100 years (1950–2050), the world’s population will increase nearly 
fourfold. Moreover, the rate of global industrialization continues to increase 
as does our use of and need for non-renewable resources. Thus, we are increas-
ingly polluting the air, water, and soil all over the planet so that some 40 % of 
deaths worldwide have been estimated to be a consequence of that pollution. This 
is because, as a result of both increasing population and industrialization, the 
earth’s atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems are no longer able to break 
down and tolerate the increasing amount of waste that human society produces. In 
fact, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
Fig. 1.1   Schematic representation of some of the limitations on the ability of the world being 
able to feed all of the people

Report released in early 2014, the overall effect of various aspects of man-made 
global warming is that worldwide food production will be significantly reduced 
compared to a world without global warming.
Ironically, between 1960 and 2010, the fraction of the human population with 
insufficient food declined from about 60 % to around 15 % indicating that up until 
now food production has more than kept pace with population growth. However, 
put simply, the problem is whether we will be able to feed another 2+ billion peo-
ple by 2050.
1.2  Possible Solutions
Given the issues that have been outlined above, it is imperative that worldwide 
action be taken on a variety of fronts. This includes the need to dramatically increase 
agricultural productivity within the next few decades. To do this, in the first instance, 
it is necessary to limit increases to the world’s population, an extremely controver-
sial subject at best. Next, it is necessary to be able to more efficiently deliver food 
from where it is produced to where it is consumed thereby decreasing much of 
the food spoilage that is common at present. Decreasing food wastage also entails 
addressing issues such as portion size in restaurants in more affluent countries. 
Then, efficient and productive agriculture needs to be practiced on what is now 
considered to be marginal land. To boost crop yields, in the short term, it will be 
tempting to use even more agricultural chemicals than at present. However, such an 
approach will certainly be counterproductive in the longer term. Thus, instead of the 
increased use of chemicals, it is essential that the use of transgenic plants and the

population from 1950 to 2050
1.1  The Problem

1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
widespread application of plant growth-promoting microorganisms, both bacteria 
and fungi, be embraced and practiced on a large scale.
Given the enormous amount of experience that scientists have had with trans-
genic plants over the past 35 or so years, it is the time for informed scientists to 
take the lead and educate both the public and the politicians regarding the many 
potential benefits of this technology. And where there are perceived problems with 
the development or use of transgenic plants, it is absolutely essential that sufficient 
resources of both time and money be directed to solving those problems for eve-
ryone’s benefit. Transgenic plants have been produced in the field for human use 
since 1996, with 1.7 million farmers in 29 countries planting over 170 million ha 
of transgenic crops in 2012. In addition, the amount of land devoted to the growth 
of transgenic plants continues to grow (doubling every 5–7 years). According to 
Dr. Florence Wambugu (Nairobi, Kenya), “The African continent urgently needs 
agricultural biotechnology, including transgenic crops, in order to improve food 
production. Famine provides critics with an opportunity to promote an anti-biotech 
message that only results in millions of people, who urgently need food, starving 
to death.” Finally, transgenic plants are useful for a very wide range of applica-
tions besides increasing crop yields. These include developing plants with abiotic 
stress resistance, insect resistance, virus resistance, herbicide resistance, pathogen 
resistance, better controlled fruit ripening, increased nutritional content, altered 
flower color, and increased flower lifetime, as well as using plants to produce edi-
ble vaccines and a host of potentially less expensive human therapeutic agents.
The interaction between bacteria and plants may be beneficial, harmful, or neu-
tral for the plant, and sometimes, the effect of a particular bacterium may vary 
as the soil conditions change (Fig. 1.3). Plant beneficial bacteria are often termed 
plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). Bacteria that interact with plants but 
Fig. 1.3   Schematic representation of the possible effects of bacteria on plants

have no discernable effect on the plant (although there is often a benefit to the 
bacteria) are termed commensal bacteria. Bacteria that are harmful to plants are 
generally considered to be plant pathogens (phytopathogens). PGPB are typically 
defined as soil bacteria that facilitate plant growth and are often found in asso-
ciation with plant roots and sometimes found on plant leaves or flowers or within 
plant tissues. Given that some PGPB began to develop a complex and mutually 
beneficial relationship with flowering plants around 80–100 million years ago, the 
rationale behind the use of PGPB in agriculture is that this approach copies what 
has been successful in nature by deliberately adding PGPB to plants to facilitate 
their growth.
1.3  Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
A large number of PGPB are commonly found in the plant rhizoplane, i.e., 
attached to roots, and the plant rhizosphere, i.e., the area immediately around the 
roots, generally up to 1 mm from the root surface (Fig. 1.4). This bacterial locali-
zation reflects the fact that plant roots commonly exude a significant fraction of 
the carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis (see below) and provide this fixed car-
bon to soil microbes that use it as a food source. Alternatively, some PGPB are 
endophytic (endo = inside; phyte = plant) and as such are able to enter into a 
Fig. 1.4   Overview of different types of plant growth-promoting bacteria
1.2  Possible Solutions

1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
plant and colonize a portion of the plant’s interior. These bacteria do this without 
harming the plant and in fact use more or less the same mechanisms as rhizos-
pheric bacteria to promote plant growth and development. Endophytic PGPB 
may be divided into two general types. First, those bacteria bind relatively non-
specifically to plant root surfaces and then enter the plant through different points 
including tissue wounds, stomata (pores found in the epidermis of leaves), len-
ticels (raised pores in the stems of woody plants), root cracks, and germinating 
radicals (the part of the embryo that develops into the root system). Second, those 
bacteria bind and infect only a very limited number of specific plants; these were 
formerly referred to as symbiotic bacteria (e.g., rhizobia that interact with specific 
legumes). Following infection, symbiotic bacteria typically form nodules on the 
plant root where this PGPB resides. Finally, although they are often not considered 
to be PGPB, many cyanobacteria are able to facilitate the growth of plants, usually 
aquatic plants. These cyanobacteria often fix both carbon and nitrogen; they some-
times but not always bind to plant surfaces.
1.3.1  Organisms in Soil
The natural world contains a very large number of species of different organisms, 
most of which are unknown and uncharacterized. For example, it has been esti-
mated that there are nearly 8 million species of animals, ~300 thousand species 
of plants, 30–40  thousand species of protozoa, and 25–30  species of chromista 
(e.g., brown algae and diatoms). Being much smaller in size, the number of dif-
ferent microorganisms is very difficult to estimate so that recent estimates of the 
number of fungal species range from a mere 600 thousand to more than 5 million. 
Moreover, estimates of the total number of bacterial species in existence range 
from around 10 million to up to one billion. Given this perspective, it is not par-
ticularly surprising that the soil is home to a very large proportion of the world’s 
biodiversity.
It has been estimated that there are more than 94 million organisms in a sin-
gle gram of soil, with most of them being bacteria (Fig.  1.5). Of course, there 
really is no such thing as a typical gram of soil, and soils and their contents vary 
enormously from one location to another. Nevertheless, nearly all soils contain a 
surprisingly large number of microorganisms, the vast majority of which are bac-
teria. The main groups of PGPB can be found along with the phyla Cyanobacteria, 
Fig. 1.5   Overview of the 
living organisms found in a 
typical gram of soil

7
Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In addition to the 
very large number of bacteria that are typically found in soil, it has been estimated 
that many soils contain an equal or even greater number of viruses, largely bacte-
rial and plant viruses. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to accurately estimate 
either the number or the types of viruses found in various soils. Given the fact that 
soil is an enormously complex environment, it is no surprise that plant growth and 
development is dramatically impacted by soil organisms, minerals, nutrients, and 
physical properties as well as a wide range of chemicals.
1.3.2  Root Exudation
The concentration of microbes around the roots of plants is typically 10- to 1,000-
fold greater than the concentration of microbes found in the rest of the soil, which 
is sometimes called the bulk soil (Fig. 1.6). This is generally attributed to the fact 
that plants commonly exude from ~5 to ~30  % of all photosynthetically fixed 
­carbon through their roots. Both the quantity and the composition of root exudates 
are determined by a number of different factors including plant species, plant age, 
plant cultivar (a variety of a plant that has been created or selected intentionally 
and maintained through cultivation), and the presence of biotic and abiotic envi-
ronmental stressors. Although root exudation represents a significant cost to plants 
in terms of energy and carbon resources, root exudates have been suggested to 
play important roles in the functioning of plants. These roles include regulation 
of the local soil microbial community by secreting both chemical attractants and 
repellants, helping to cope with herbivores, changing the chemical and physical 
properties of the soil, and preventing the growth of potentially crop-inhibiting 
plant species. Root exudates are generally composed of low molecular weight 
compounds such as amino acids, sugars, organic acids, and phenolics as well as 
higher molecular weight compounds such as mucilage (viscous polysaccharides 
present in plant roots) and proteins. Sugars typically attract various microbes; 
flavonoids interact with mycorrhizae (a type of plant growth-promoting fungi), 
Fig. 1.6   Scanning electron micrograph of PGPB bound to a canola root hair
1.3  Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria

8
1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
rhizobia (bacteria that form a symbiotic relationship with specific legume plants), 
and pathogenic fungi; aliphatic acids attract certain bacteria; and fatty acids and 
proteins are also secreted.
The mechanism(s) by which plant roots secrete/exude compounds is ­considered 
to be a largely passive process. This can occur through diffusion, ion channels, 
or vesicle transport (Fig. 1.7). It is thought that ABC transporters, driven by ATP 
hydrolysis, are responsible for the exudation of lipids and flavonoids; anion chan-
nels for sugars and other carbohydrates; metal transporters for various metals; 
aquaporins (proteins embedded in the cell membrane) for water and uncharged 
molecules; diffusion for a range of low molecular weight compounds; and vesicles 
for high molecular weight compounds such as proteins.
Sometimes, root exudates contain antibiotics that inhibit the growth of either 
bacteria or fungi, as well as numerous other bioactive compounds. For example, 
root exudates of the plant Lithospermum erythrorhizon, a Chinese herbal medi-
cine, produce pigmented naphthoquinones that have biological activity against 
soilborne bacteria and fungi. Isolating and identifying some of these compounds 
is an important step in developing some of them for use in combatting either plant 
or animal diseases. One way to isolate and identify unique bioactive compounds 
includes growing plants and collecting root exudates (Fig. 1.8), bioassaying the 
root exudates for various activities, and then fractionating the root exudates until a 
pure compound is obtained.
1.3.3  Effect of PGPB on Plants
PGPB have been documented to positively affect plants in a number of different 
ways. Thus, as a consequence of treating plants with PGPB, any one or more of the 
following may be observed: (i) increased biomass (Fig. 1.9); (ii) increased nitrogen, 
phosphorus, or iron content; (iii) increased root and/or shoot length; (iv) enhanced 
seed germination; (v) increased disease resistance; (vi) increased tolerance to various 
environmental stresses; (vii) increased production of useful secondary metabolites

(e.g., essential oils in Origanum majorana or sweet marjoram (Fig. 1.10); and (viii) 
better plant nutrition, especially the edible portions of the plant.
In the example shown in Fig.  1.9, the well-characterized endophytic PGPB 
Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN was found to significantly promote the growth 
(biomass production) of three different cultivars of switchgrass (Panicum virga-
tum cv. Alamo). Switchgrass is a non-crop plant that grows well on marginal land 
(generally considered to be unsuitable for agriculture) that may be useful as a so-
called biomass crop, in this case used for the production of ethanol or butanol, or 
as a component of phytoremediation protocols (see Chap. 7).

1.3  Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria

1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
PGPB may stimulate plant growth in a variety of ways other than by merely 
increasing biomass. For example, several different PGPB strains (previously 
shown to increase plant biomass) were tested for the ability to promote the pro-
duction of an essential oil in the plant Origanum majorana (sweet marjoram). In 
this case, the P. fluorescens strain was slightly better than the other PGPB that 
were tested in facilitating plant growth. However, the Pseudomonas fluorescens 
strain promoted the production of the essential oil (used to flavor foods and in fra-
grances) produced by this plant nearly 30 times compared to the untreated (con-
trol) plant (Fig. 1.10). Importantly, the composition of the essential oil remained 
unchanged following bacterial treatment of the plant roots. In addition, another 
PGPB strain, also a strain of P. fluorescens, was found to enhance both biomass 
yield and ajmalicine (an alkaloid that acts as an antihypertensive drug used in the 
treatment of high blood pressure) production in Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar 
periwinkle) plants that were subjected to water-deficit stress.
Another example of the effectiveness and possible practical use of PGPB 
comes from the observation that it is possible to select bacterial strains that, in 
addition to increasing plant biomass, can significantly increase the yield of chilli 
fruit (Capsicum annuum L.) under field conditions. In this work, scientists isolated 
a number of rhizosphere bacteria and then tested them for the ability to produce 
the plant hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) and iron-binding siderophores; then, 
15 selected strains were tested for the ability to promote plant growth in pots in 
the greenhouse. The three most effective strains were then tested in the field for 
the ability to increase the yield of chillies. As shown in Table 1.1, when two of the 
selected strains were applied together, the fruit number and biomass increased dra-
matically. In the end, with the best strain combination, it was possible to increase

the number of chillies per plant by approximately threefold and the biomass of 
chillies per plant by sixfold compared to the control that was untreated by added 
PGPB.
PGPB may affect plant growth and development either directly or indirectly 
(Fig.  1.11). Direct promotion of plant growth occurs when a bacterium either 
facilitates the acquisition of essential nutrient resources from the environment or 
modulates the level of hormones within a plant. Nutrient acquisition facilitated 
by PGPB, or at least the best studied of the nutrients in this category, includes

1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron. PGPB are known to directly affect plant growth by 
synthesizing and providing one or more of the phytohormones auxin, cytokinin, 
and gibberellin. In addition, some PGPB can lower levels of the phytohormone 
ethylene by synthesizing an enzyme, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) 
deaminase, that cleaves the compound ACC, the immediate precursor of ethyl-
ene in all higher plants. Indirect promotion of plant growth occurs when PGPB 
(sometimes called a biocontrol PGPB or just a biocontrol bacterium) prevent, or 
at least decrease, the damage to that might otherwise ensue as a consequence of 
the infection of the plant with any one of the various phytopathogens. These phy-
topathogens typically include various soil fungi and bacteria. In addition, PGPB, 
by a range of different indirect mechanisms, may lessen the damage to plants from 
either insects or nematodes.
Throughout the detailed discussions of PGPB mechanisms that appear in subse-
quent chapters in this book, it is essential to keep several things in mind. (i) Not all 
PGPB utilize the same mechanisms. (ii) Any particular PGPB strain may use any 
one or more of the many mechanisms that are discussed. (iii) A PGPB strain may 
use both direct and indirect mechanisms. (iv) Not all strains of the same genus and 
species have the same PGPB activities. (v) Different plants (including different 
cultivars of the same plant) may respond differently to a particular PGPB strain, 
usually reflecting differences in plant physiology/biochemistry. (vi) The same 
plant may respond differently to a particular PGPB strain, usually reflecting differ-
ences in plant physiology/biochemistry that are often a function of plant age and 
growth conditions (including soil composition, growth temperature, the presence 
or absence of stressful compounds, and/or phytopathogens).
Since rhizobial strains, that usually form a highly specific relationship with 
their plant hosts, employ more or less the same set of mechanisms as other PGPB, 
they are sometimes able to bind to the roots of non-legume plants and subse-
quently stimulate plant growth. Thus, it was recently observed that Rhizobium 
leguminosarum strain PEPV16 was able to colonize the roots of lettuce and car-
rot plants (both non-legumes) and promote the growth of both plants as well as 
increasing the uptake of N and P in the edible parts of both plants.
In addition to promoting the growth of crop plants in a traditional agricultural 
setting, PGPB may be used to stimulate the rooting of some vegetatively propa-
gated plants such as olive plants. In Southern Spain, the world’s largest olive oil 
producing region, there is significant motivation for production to be free of any 
chemical input including herbicides and pesticides. In one set of experiments, 
researchers added various PGPB to cuttings of three different olive tree cultivars. 
Although the results were somewhat variable, depending on the cultivar and the 
mode of adding the PGPB, the Pantoea strain was the only bacterial strain that 
always produces a high rooting percentage (typically equivalent to or better than 
the addition of indolebutyric acid, an analog of IAA). As this bacterial strain was 
not the best IAA producer, its effectiveness is thought to reflect a combination of 
IAA production and ACC deaminase activity (Table 1.2). This result was in agree-
ment with other work where PGPB that both produced IAA and contained ACC 
deaminase activity produced a large number of relatively long roots (which are 

13
more effective in helping the plant to become established) compared to IAA or 
indolebutyric acid that produced a large number of very short roots. In summary, 
these experiments suggest that PGPB with appropriate traits may become effective 
components of the organic production of olive trees used for producing olive oil.
1.4  Root Microbiome
There are an enormous numbers of bacteria in soil, sometimes including as many 
as 106 different taxa (taxonomic groups such as bacteria of different genera and 
species) in a typical gram of soil. Given the diversity of soil bacteria, a question 
that arises is whether there are particular features that facilitate the colonization of 
plant rhizospheres by certain bacteria and not by others. To address this question, 
two groups of scientists separately used the technique of next generation sequenc-
ing (see Chap. 4) to elaborate the DNA sequences of all of the 16S rRNA genes 
(a part of the 30S small sub-unit of prokaryotic ribosomes) in soil, rhizospheric 
and endophytic bacteria from different strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana 
(Fig. 1.12). Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) is a small flowering plant related 
to cabbage and canola that is commonly used a model organism in plant biology, 
in part as a consequence of its very small genome (compared to nearly all other 
plants) that facilitates genetic studies. The sequence of the 16S rRNA is highly 
conserved between different species of bacteria so that its DNA sequence is used 
as a means of classifying bacteria into a particular genus and species. These two 
groups of researchers took soil, rhizospheric, and endophytic samples from several 
different Arabidopsis strains, each grown in different soils. Both of these groups 
reported that the composition of the rhizospheric and the endophytes microbi-
omes were defined primarily by soil type. In addition, the researchers reported that 
Arabidopsis contains a typical “core” microbiome, ~60 % of which is “recruited”

from common soil bacteria. This core microbiome is “selected” by the ability 
of individual bacteria to grow in Arabidopsis root exudates. The remaining bac-
teria that were identified appeared to be responding and subsequently binding to

the plant root’s lignocellulosic surface. These results were also independent of 
plant age. It remains to be demonstrated whether other plants behave similarly to 
Arabidopsis in selecting their microbiome from the soil; however, it is likely that 
this will turn out to be the case.
The root microbiome (rhizospheric and endophytic) may develop based on both 
positive and negative selection pressures that occur as a result of the composition 
of root exudates. For a start, soil bacteria are largely dependent upon exogenous 
carbon sources for both energy, and growth and development. The release of cer-
tain specific compounds by plant roots therefore select for the limited number of 
bacteria that are able to use those compounds. Moreover, root exudates are gener-
ally plant specific and the use of these specific compounds often acts as signals 
in establishing a plant’s affinity for particular bacteria. For example, some rhizo-
sphere bacteria can use indole acetic acid (IAA, auxin) produced by the plant as 
a carbon source for growth. Similarly, only a limited number of soil bacteria can 
utilize sulfur-containing compounds such as methionine for their growth. Those 
bacteria that can utilize the sulfur-containing compounds that are typically pro-
duced by cruciferous plants such as canola and cauliflower will therefore be found 
commonly in the microbiome of those plants.
1.5  PGPB Mechanisms
Historically, most of the interest in PGPB was based on the ability of either (i) 
some PGPB to act as biocontrol agents decreasing the damage to plants from phy-
topathogens or (ii) some rhizobia strains to form symbiotic relationships with spe-
cific legumes and then providing those plants with fixed nitrogen. In fact, these are 
still major interests of a large number of researchers in this field. As well, the vast 
majority of commercialized PGPB strains have been developed to address these 
two issues. This focus is most likely a reflection of the generally held view that 
in the field it is easier to reproducibly demonstrate the efficacy of biocontrol plant 
growth-promoting bacteria or nitrogen-fixing rhizobia rather than PGPB that pro-
mote plant growth in other ways.
As addressed briefly in Sect.  1.3.3, there are several ways in which different 
PGPB can directly facilitate the proliferation of their plant hosts (Fig. 1.11). PGPB 
may fix atmospheric nitrogen and supply it to plants; synthesize siderophores which 
can solubilize and sequester iron from the soil and provide it to plant cells; synthe-
size phytohormones such as auxins, cytokinins, or gibberellins which can enhance 
plant growth; provide mechanisms for the solubilization of phosphorus making it 
more readily available for plant growth; and synthesize the enzyme ACC deaminase 
which lowers potentially inhibitory plant ethylene levels. Any particular bacterium 
may affect plant growth and development using any one, or more, of these mecha-
nisms. Moreover, a bacterium may utilize different traits at various times during the 
life cycle of the plant. For example, following seed germination, PGPB may lower 
the plant’s ethylene concentration thereby decreasing the ethylene inhibition of

seedling root length. Once the seedling has depleted the resources that are contained 
within the seed, the PGPB may help to provide the plant with a sufficient amount 
of iron and phosphorus from the soil. Through early plant development, PGPB may 
stimulate cell division by providing appropriate levels of phytohormones.
1.6  Screening for New PGPB
Until relatively recently, the isolation of new PGPB strains typically required that 
researchers use a long and quite tedious approach (Fig.  1.13). Briefly, this task 
typically entailed isolating a large number of bacterial strains (often hundreds, 
thousands, or even ten of thousands) from the soil around the roots of various 
crop plants. These bacteria were then tested using any one of the number of dif-
ferent biological assays. The simplest of these screens entailed testing the isolated 
bacteria for biocontrol activity against one or more fungal pathogens. The easiest 
way to do this is to test each bacterial strain for the ability to prevent the prolif-
eration of one or more phytopathogens on agar plates (Fig. 1.14). Other screen-
ing procedures test the ability of isolated bacterial strains to protect plants in soil 
against damage by certain fungal or bacterial pathogens. While these procedures 
are effective, they are both time consuming and limited in that they only select 
for certain types of biocontrol strains and are completely unable to select for bac-
teria that promote plant growth directly. Typically, bacteria that promote plant 
growth directly are selected from a large number of soil bacteria by testing each 
individual bacterial strain for its ability to promote plant growth, either in growth 
pouches or in soil, a process that typically requires growing a very large number of 
Fig. 1.13   Flowchart depicting various methods for selecting new PGPB

17
plants for each strain that is being assessed. The large number of plants required 
to directly test for plant growth promotion is necessitated by the natural variation 
in plant seeds and their growth, especially in short term (i.e., a few days) assays. 
In addition, plant growth assays may be tested with several different plants, differ-
ent soils, and different growth conditions. The growth of plants in soil is typically 
assessed by measuring the plant’s aboveground plant biomass (wet or dry weight). 
Growth pouches (which do not include soil and typically only follow plant growth 
for a few days) are often used to measure relative root growth since measurement 
of plant root biomass or length is technically difficult to do when plants are grown 
in soil. This is because the removal of soil from plant roots often results in the 
breakage of smaller plant roots. Nevertheless, with care, it is sometimes possi-
ble to assess the root biomass of plant grown in soil (Fig. 1.15). The above-men-
tioned procedures often take several months or more before a suitable strain can 
be identified. As an alternative to these methods for isolating new PGPB, a rapid 
and novel procedure for the isolation of ACC deaminase-containing bacteria that, 
by definition, are able to promote plant growth was developed (see Chap. 3). This 
procedure is both rapid and highly effective, yielding new PGPB, ready for further 
characterization and testing, within one to two weeks.
Two very different groups of workers use PGPB in their studies. On the one 
hand, scientists whose efforts are motivated by the desire to increase plant crop 
yields primarily isolate, characterize, and utilize rhizospheric PGPB. On the other 
Fig. 1.14   Representation of a method used to assess PGPB for biocontrol activity. The phytopatho-
gen is spotted in the middle of the agar plate (shown in black), while various potential biocontrol 
PGPB strains are spotted around the edges of the plate (spots 1–4; shown in white). Following incu-
bation, the phytopathogen proliferates over the entire plate except where it is prevented from growing 
by one of the strains being tested. The strains spotted in positions 1 and 4 do not exhibit any biocon-
trol activity, while the strains spotted in positions 2 and 3 prevent the pathogen from proliferating and 
show a zone of clearance in their vicinity
1.6  Screening for New PGPB

18
1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
hand, scientists whose focus is using PGPB to facilitate phytoremediation (envi-
ronmental cleanup using plants; see Chap. 7) rarely use rhizospheric PGPB and 
instead for the most part use endophytic PGPB. More recently, workers focused on 
augmenting crop yields have increasingly turned their attention to the roles played 
by endophytic bacteria in promoting plant growth. Endophytic bacteria include 
(i) facultative endophytes that can live inside plants as well as in other habitats, 
(ii) obligate endophytes that can only live inside of a plant, and (iii) opportunis-
tic endophytes that can occasionally enter plants and live inside their tissues. 
However, the fact that scientists can isolate and characterize specific endophytic 
strains means that they are likely dealing exclusively with facultative endophytes. 
Facultative endophytes may be isolated by collecting rhizosphere soil samples, 
planting seeds in those samples, isolating and macerating plant tissue grown from 
those seeds, and then culturing the bacteria contained within that tissue (Fig. 1.16).
1.7  Commercial Inoculants
The earliest recorded instance of the commercialization of PGPB occurred in the USA 
and the UK in 1895. This commercialization included the inoculation of legumes with 
strains of rhizobia. This early history notwithstanding, it was nearly 100 years before 
the commercial interest in PGPB of various types became more widespread.

19
1.7.1  Commercial Considerations
What are the features of a PGPB strain that a company needs to consider when 
developing that strain for the marketplace? In the first instance, most of the lab-
oratory studies of PGPB have focused on rhizospheric bacteria (Table  1.3). 
However, it may be advantageous to utilize endophytic strains (which use essen-
tially the same mechanisms to promote plant growth as rhizospheric bacteria) that 
are less subject to variations of soil type, soil pH, weather, etc. [It has been sug-
gested that shortly after PGPB are introduced into the soil in the field (without 
carrier), the population of those bacteria declines rapidly.] Second, it is important 
to ­understand what types of biological mechanisms are required to promote plant 
growth under different conditions so that these activities are present when needed 
(see Chaps. 2, 3 and 5). Third, it is absolutely essential that the selected strain be 
non-pathogenic to both animals (including humans) and plants. Fourth, it is advan-
tageous if the selected strain is easy to grow on inexpensive medium that does not

­rhizospheres of various plants; seeds are planted in each soil sample; once the plants have reached a 
suitable size, the plant tissue, typically shoots and leaves, is first washed to remove surface adhering 
bacteria and then macerated; the bacteria from the macerated tissue are isolated and characterized

require any specialized or costly equipment. In this regard, gram-negative ­bacteria 
are often easier to grow and manipulate in a laboratory environment. Fifth, the 
selected strain should be sufficiently stable that it will not appreciably lose activity 
during storage or shipping. It is advantageous if the strain can be shipped in a lyo-
philized form (preferably without a carrier) since lyophilized bacteria weigh much 
less than bacteria in solution. In addition, when gram-positive bacteria are grown 
to a late stage of growth and exhaust the supply of nutrients in the medium, they 
often form spores that are very stable and extremely long lived and may be reac-
tivated into vegetatively growing bacteria when the nutrient conditions change. 
Sixth, it is best to avoid using strains that are genetically unstable. Thus, numer-
ous workers have found that strains sometimes have a particular metabolic activity 
when they are originally isolated but then lose that activity upon repeated sub-
culturing in the laboratory. Seventh, since many seeds are chemically coated, it is 
imperative that the PGPB strain does not interact in any way with the chemicals 
that are planted along with the seed. Eighth, even an endophytic strain will per-
form more efficiently if it has been selected for certain soil conditions. Thus, for 
example, a bacterium from a cold environment may function in a hot and dry envi-
ronment, but probably not optimally. Ninth, it is necessary to develop and opti-
mize the plant inoculation procedure so that the bacterium is as stable and active, 
especially prior to planting, as possible (see the section below). Tenth, some com-
panies have sought to patent protect their PGPB strains, while others have kept 
the precise nature of the active ingredients of their inoculants a trade secret (see 
Chap. 8). Regardless of what approach is taken, it is necessary for companies to 
develop some strategies that protect their intellectual property. Eleventh, although 
there are a number of reports where genetically engineered PGPB are more 
­effective under laboratory conditions, for the foreseeable future, only naturally 
occurring PGPB are likely to be acceptable worldwide to both regulatory agen-
cies and farmers. Twelfth, when introducing a new PGPB strain into the market, it 
is important to consider what similar or comparable strains already exist in order

to distinguish the newly introduced strain from all others. While not unique to the 
commercialization of PGPB, it is necessary to actively market any new product so 
that the potential user of that product is convinced that there is a real need for it.
1.7.2  Inoculation Methods
Many procedures work simply and easily in the laboratory; however, the scale-up 
of these procedures, often by 1,000- to 10,000-fold, is not necessarily straightfor-
ward. Bacterial preparations suitable for inoculating crop plants on a commercial 
scale may take any one of the several different forms. Those bacterial inoculant 
preparations should provide some measure of physical protection for the PGPB 
once it is introduced into the soil. For example, wet inoculants of bacterial sus-
pensions are often sold in 1–5 l plastic bags. Perhaps surprisingly, wet inoculants 
generally exhibit good stability and lifetime (having a shelf life of six months to 
a year). However, unless they are produced locally, cell suspensions (which are 
mostly water) need to be shipped (often long distances) and shipping costs can 
be expensive. Peat-based inoculants, where PGPB are mixed with peat (partially 
decayed vegetation that typically forms in wetland conditions where the rate of 
decomposition is slowed because of the lack of oxygen), are very commonly used 
in the commercial application of PGPB. They are generally quite stable and may 
last up to several years. Peat slurry inoculants made from finely milled and steri-
lized peat are commonly used in Australia to inoculate legume crops with various 
rhizobia strains. These inoculants, which typically support 109–1010 bacterial cells 
per gram of peat, often include the use of adhesives and other polymers to ensure 
good contact between the rhizobia and the legume seed coat. Seeds prepared in 
this way are generally sown within hours of the inoculant preparation. Adsorption 
onto inert materials such as talc (a soft light-colored mineral), kaolinite (a hydrous 
aluminum silicate), lignite (a soft brownish-black coal), bentonite (an aluminum 
silicate clay from volcanic ash), or vermiculite (a hydrated silicate mineral) is also 
used as a common method of delivering PGPB to plant roots. Finally, PGPB may 
be delivered to plants via encapsulation, generally either in alginate or in calcium 
carbonate. The latter procedure is used commonly in Japan.
Bentonite is often used to prepare rhizobia inoculants. As a dry powder even 
after it is mixed with the bacterial inoculant, it is easier to ship and store as it 
does not require refrigeration. Bentonite also buffers rhizobia against the possible 
effects of chemical pesticides that may be used to coat the seed.
One group of researchers has reported very promising results using algi-
nate microbeads to encapsulate PGPB. To prepare these microbeads, a concen-
trated suspension of PGPB was mixed with alginate and skim milk. The bacteria 
were then forced through a 0.2 nm pore and sprayed onto a 0.1 M solution of 
CaCl2. The CaCl2 causes the alginate to form microbeads which, when they are 
1.7  Commercial Inoculants

22
1  Introduction to Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria
dried, can be stored with the bacteria within the alginate remaining viable for 
long ­periods of time. It is argued that this method is much more reproducible 
than using peat as a carrier since different batches of peat may be quite variable 
from one another. However, it remains to be seen whether this approach will be 
adopted for commercial use.
1.7.3  Large-scale Growth of PGPB
An essential aspect of the commercialization of PGPB is the need to develop 
strategies for the large-scale growth of these bacteria. Optimal growth conditions 
include determining, for any particular size bioreactor, the temperature, pH, rate 
of mixing of the growing cells, and the means of providing the growing cells with 
sufficient oxygen. Because oxygen is only sparingly soluble in water, it must be 
supplied continuously to growing (aerobic) bacterial cultures. However, the intro-
duction of air (which is ~20 % oxygen) into a bioreactor produces bubbles, and 
if the bubbles are too large, the rate of transfer of oxygen to the cells is insuffi-
cient to support the optimal growth. Thus, fermenter design should include provi-
sion for monitoring the dissolved oxygen level of the culture, providing oxygen to 
the culture and adequately mixing the culture to efficiently disperse the bubbles. 
Adequate mixing of a microbial culture is essential for many aspects of fermenta-
tion, including assurance of an adequate supply of nutrients to the cells and pre-
vention of the accumulation of any toxic metabolic by-products in local, poorly 
mixed regions of the bioreactor. Effective mixing is easily attained with small-
scale cultures, but it may become a major problem when the scale of fermentation 
is increased. Here, it is important to bear in mind that the optimal conditions gen-
erally change with each tenfold increase in the volume of a bioreactor.
There are also other technical considerations. The design of the bioreactor is 
important. It should ensure adequate sterility and probes that permit the accu-
rate and continuous online monitoring of as many critical reaction parameters 
as possible so that adjustments can easily be made throughout the course of 
the fermentation reaction (i.e., the growth of the microorganism). In addition, 
because high-temperature sterilization may alter the composition of the growth 
medium (e.g., by destroying vitamins), it is important to ascertain that the 
medium composition is still optimal for maximal microbial growth following 
sterilization.
Generally, in the scale-up of the growth of microorganisms from laboratory 
scale to production scale, fermentations are developed in a stepwise manner. A 
typical procedure begins with formulation and sterilization of the growth medium 
and sterilization of the fermentation equipment. The cells are grown first as a stock 
culture (5–10 mL), then in a shake flask (200–1,000 mL), and in a seed fermenter 
(10–100  L). Finally, the production fermenter (1,000–10,000  L) is inoculated. 
After the last fermentation step is completed, the cells are separated from the cul-
ture fluid by either centrifugation or filtration.

23
Bacteria can be grown in batch, fed-batch, or continuous culture. In batch fer-
mentation, the sterile growth medium is inoculated with the appropriate bacteria, 
and the fermentation proceeds without the addition of fresh growth medium. In 
fed-batch fermentation, small volumes of concentrated nutrients are added at vari-
ous times during the fermentation reaction; no growth medium is removed until 
the end of the process. In continuous fermentation, fresh growth medium is added 
continuously during fermentation, but there is also simultaneous removal of an 
equal volume of spent medium containing suspended microorganisms. Continuous 
fermentation is generally considered to be an experimental procedure and is sel-
dom used for industrial-scale fermentations. For each type of fermentation, oxy-
gen (usually in the form of sterile air), an antifoaming agent, and, if required, acid 
or base are injected into the bioreactor as needed.
During a batch fermentation, the composition of the culture medium, the con-
centration of bacteria (biomass concentration), and the internal chemical com-
position of the bacteria, all change as a consequence of the state of cell growth, 
cellular metabolism, and availability of nutrients. Under these conditions, cells 
typically go through lag phase (where the inoculum cells adjust their metabolism 
to the new medium), acceleration phase, logarithmic or exponential phase, decel-
eration phase, stationary phase (caused by depletion of a critical growth substance 
where growth ceases and cellular metabolism changes dramatically), and death 
phase.
Nutrient additions during fed-batch fermentation prolong both the log and 
stationary phases, thereby increasing the biomass. Because it is often difficult to 
measure the substrate concentration directly during the fermentation reaction, 
other indicators that are correlated with the consumption of substrate, such as the 
production of organic acids, changes in the pH, or the production of CO2, can be 
used to estimate when additional substrate is needed. Generally, fed-batch fer-
mentations require more monitoring and greater control than batch fermentations 
and are therefore used to a lesser extent despite the fact that they may result in a 
significantly increased amount of bacterial biomass. Depending upon the particu-
lar microorganism, a fed-batch fermentation strategy can increase the yield from 
25 % to more than 1,000 % compared with batch fermentation.
1.7.4  Commercialized Inoculants
A limited but growing number of PGPB are available commercially (Table 1.4). 
The majority of these strains are biocontrol agents that contribute indirectly to pro-
moting the growth of various crops. However, a few of these commercially avail-
able bacterial strains directly promote plant growth. In addition, a much larger 
number of Rhizobia spp. have been developed as inocula for various legume crops.
In addition to inocula that contain a single PGPB, several companies are mar-
keting products that contain two or more different bacterial strains that are able 
to act synergistically. For example, a product sold under the name BioYield™,

consisting of a mixture of Paenibacillus macerans GB122 and Bacillus

cantaloupes, and peppers. Prior to treating seeds or roots of plants, BioYield™ 
is combined with the other components of the planting mix and then mixed thor-
oughly into a uniform composition including sufficient water to completely wet 
the mixture. When it was tested, plants treated with BioYield™ showed a growth 
response both in the greenhouse and in the field, with fruit yield increases in dif-
ferent trials ranging from 5 to 35 %. Treated plants typically have earlier flower-
ing and increased yield of earlier and larger fruit with some reductions in disease 
severity and incidence. However, the manufacturer cautions users that BioYield™ 
should not be used in place of commercial pest control measures as the reduction 
in disease resistance that is observed is likely to due to the increased health of the 
treated plants.
Another mixed bacterial inoculant called SoySuperbC includes the bacterium 
Delftia acidovorans RAY209 and a strain of Bradyrhizobium japonicum in one 
package. D. acidovorans RAY209 is a sulfur-oxidizing gram-negative bacterium 
that facilitates sulfur uptake, an important trait for crops grown in sulfur limited 
soils, while B. japonicum is a nitrogen-fixing rhizobia that specifically nodulates 
soybean roots. SoySuperb™ is sold as a liquid formulation with an estimated shelf 
life of eight months. The potential market for SoySuperb™ includes the 75 mil-
lion acres in the USA and ~3 million acres in Canada that are under soybean cul-
tivation. In addition, an increasing amount of soybean is being grown in Latin 
America.

To grow, both plants and bacteria utilize nutrients that are mainly acquired from 
the soil environment. In addition to small amounts of a number of different metals, 
plants and bacteria require fixed nitrogen, iron, and phosphorus. In this chapter, 
the mechanisms and genes involved in PGPB and plant resource acquisition are 
discussed in some detail. In fact, one of the major benefits that PGPB provide to 
their plant partners is that they facilitate the plant’s acquisition of resources from 
the soil.
2.1  Nitrogen Fixation
One of the major nutrients necessary for the growth of all living organisms 
including plants and bacteria is nitrogen. Despite nitrogen’s abundance in the 
earth’s atmosphere, i.e., ~80 %, it must first be reduced to ammonia before it can 
be metabolized by plants to become an integral component of proteins, nucleic 
acids, and other biological molecules. This conversion requires a high input of 
energy because the triple bond of N2 is extremely stable. Consequently, contem-
porary agriculture, especially in more developed countries, relies heavily on the 
use of nitrogen fertilizers derived at the expense of petroleum. In fact, 1.3 tons 
of oil, or an equivalent amount of energy, are needed to fix 1 ton of ammonia, 
and more than 100 million tons of fixed nitrogen are needed annually to sustain 
global food production. Besides being costly, the production of chemical nitrogen 
fertilizers depletes non-renewable resources and poses human and environmental 
hazards. On the other hand, nature has ingeniously solved this problem through 
the process of biological nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, or diazo-
trophs, annually produce about 60 % of the earth’s newly fixed nitrogen. With 
the objective of reducing the world’s dependency on energy intensive chemical

fertilizers, over the past 30–40  years there has been a large body of research 
directed toward understanding and eventually utilizing biologically fixed nitrogen 
in agriculture.
A wide range of bacteria can fix nitrogen, and a number of them have poten-
tial as crop fertilizers; eukaryotes do not fix nitrogen. Diazotrophic bacteria 
include, but are not limited to, several genera of cyanobacteria; the symbiotic gen-
era Rhizobia, Sinorhizobia, Bradyrhizobia, Mesorhizobia, and Frankia; rhizos-
pheric; and endophytic genera Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Klebsiella, Bacillus, and 
Pseudomonas.
2.1.1  Cyanobacteria
Cyanobacteria, previously called blue-green algae, share some characteristics of 
both bacteria and plants. Although they share many characteristics with gram-­
negative bacteria, cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins 
(proteins that capture light energy which is passed on to chlorophylls during pho-
tosynthesis). Cyanobacteria are capable of both photosynthesis (fix atmospheric 
CO2) and nitrogen fixation; however, while all cyanobacteria are photosynthetic, 
only some can fix nitrogen. A number of different studies have been reported on 
the use of dried cyanobacteria as a fertilizer to inoculate soils and aid fertility. 
Moreover, there are a large number of studies in which cyanobacteria have been 
added to rice paddies with the result that the nitrogen that they fix and release may 
be taken up and used by the rice plants. This strategy is typically quite effective 
as sufficient fixed nitrogen is often considered to be rice’s major growth-limiting 
factor. Following seed germination and a short growth phase in a greenhouse, rice 
seedlings are generally transplanted to paddies where the roots and a portion of the 
plant are continuously submerged. It is estimated that globally there are more than 
160 million hectares of land devoted to the cultivation of rice. Diazotrophic cyano-
bacteria may be added to the water in the paddy where they proliferate and release 
some of their fixed nitrogen into the water to be taken up by the rice plants. In 
addition to rice, in many topical and subtropical environments, other crops includ-
ing vegetables, wheat, sorghum, corn, cotton, and sugarcane are also grown 
using cyanobacteria as a biofertilizer. Moreover, in some regions, the heterocyst-
ous cyanobacterium-Anabaena azollae is found within the leaf cavity of the fern 
Azolla with this partnership acting as a traditional biofertilizer.
Some cyanobacteria such as Nostoc spp. and Anabaena spp. consist of long 
chains of two different types of cells, vegetative cells, and heterocysts (Fig. 2.1). 
The vegetative cells, typically about 90–95 % of the total number of cells, are pho-
tosynthetic while the larger and thick-walled heterocysts are nitrogen fixing. The 
vegetative cells and the heterocysts exchange nutrients so that all of the cyanobac-
terial cells have sufficient levels of both nitrogen and newly fixed carbon necessary 
to support the growth of the organism. Nitrogen is typically transported as glu-
tamine while carbon may be transported as sucrose.

31
In one interesting experiment, scientists were able to genetically manipulate 
Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 so that it contained an increased number of het-
erocysts and therefore fixed more nitrogen than usual. Recently, the hetR gene, 
which encodes a serine-type protease, has been identified as a master regulator of 
heterocyst differentiation. Thus, one group of researchers cloned the Anabaena 
hetR gene, expressed it under the control of a strong light-inducible Anabaena 
promoter, and integrated the entire construct into an intergenic region within the 
Anabaena genome, with the final construct containing two copies of the hetR 
gene—the original gene and the recombinant gene. The resulting high expres-
sion of an additional copy of the hetR gene elevated HetR protein expression and 
increased rice plant fresh weight and the amount of fixed nitrogen in the recom-
binant strain (Fig.  2.2). The ability of Anabaena/Nostoc strains to grow and be 
sustained photoautodiazotrophically (being both photosynthetic and nitrogen fix-
ing) under tropical light, moisture, and temperature means that these strains can 
be used as nitrogen biofertilizers in flooded rice fields. This clever and simple 
strategy works well under laboratory conditions; however, it remains to be seen 
whether regulatory agencies in various countries will permit this recombinant 
cyanobacterial strain to be used in the open environment.

In addition to providing fixed nitrogen, cyanobacteria may also benefit crop 
plants by providing various growth-promoting substances such as gibberel-
lins, auxins, vitamins, free amino acids, and various carbohydrates and sugars. 
Moreover, many cyanobacteria are able to solubilize inorganic phosphate and 
make it available for crop growth.
Given their ability to fix both carbon and nitrogen, there has recently been con-
siderable interest in utilizing cyanobacteria as microbial cell factories as an alter-
native for bioenergy production. Some of the advantages of using cyanobacteria to 
synthesize various biofuels include the following (i) they grow relatively rapidly, 
(ii) under favorable weather conditions, they can be grown during the entire year, 
(iii) they can be cultivated in brackish water and on non-arable land, (iv) they can 
sometimes be grown on wastewater, (v) they do not require fertilizers, pesticides, 
or herbicides, and (vi) after the biofuel has been extracted, the residual biomass 
may sometimes be useful as a cattle feed. Unfortunately, to be cost-effective, the 
large-scale growth of cyanobacteria is often performed in open tanks that may be 
subject to contamination. While there are not as yet any commercial products that 
have been produced from either wild-type or by genetically engineered cyanobac-
teria, several products have been produced on a small scale by cyanobacteria under 
laboratory conditions including ethanol, isobutyraldehyde, isobutanol, 1-butanol, 
isoprene, hydrogen, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols.
2.1.2  Rhizobia
At the present time, ever-increasing amounts of Rhizobia are being utilized in 
conjunction with the growth of legume crops as an alternative to chemically fixed 
nitrogen. In addition, the extensive biochemical and molecular biological studies of 
symbiotic diazotrophs, such as rhizobia, have served as a conceptual starting point 
for understanding some of the mechanisms of growth promotion by other PGPB.
Rhizobia are gram-negative, flagellated, and rod shaped, and they form sym-
biotic relationships with legumes. Generally, each rhizobial species is specific for 
a limited number of plants and will not interact with plants other than its natural 
hosts (Table 2.1). In general, scientists isolate new strains of rhizobia by culturing 
the bacteria that are found within legume root nodules.
As part of their life cycle, rhizobial bacteria invade plant root cells and initi-
ate a complex series of developmental changes that lead to the formation of a 
root nodule. Inside the root nodule, the bacteria proliferate and persist in a form 
called a bacteroid that has no cell wall (Fig. 2.3). The bacteria within the nodules 
fix atmospheric nitrogen by means of the enzyme nitrogenase. The structural and 
biochemical interactions between a symbiotic rhizobacterium and a host plant are 
quite complex and mutually beneficial (Fig. 2.4). Inside a nodule, nitrogenase is 
protected from the toxic effects of atmospheric oxygen in two ways. First, oxygen 
does not readily diffuse into the thick-walled nodule. Second, the oxygen content 
within a nodule is regulated by the protein leghemoglobin. The heme moiety of 

33
this oxygen-binding protein is synthesized by the bacterium. On the other hand, the 
globin portion of the leghemoglobin molecule is encoded within the plant genome. 
The leghemoglobin imparts a red color to the inside of the nodule (in much the 
same way that mammalian hemoglobin is colored red). As a consequence of this 
symbiotic relationship, the plant provides the bacterium with photosynthetically 
fixed carbon (generally in the form of organic acids), which the bacterium requires 
for growth. In turn, nodule bacteria provide the plant with fixed nitrogen.
2.1.2.1  Nitrogenase
The interest in diazotrophs as biological fertilizers overlapped the development 
of techniques for gene isolation and manipulation, thereby providing the impe-
tus for studying the biochemical and molecular biological aspects of nitrogen

fixation. Initially, these studies were undertaken in the belief that they would lead 
to the development of improved nitrogen-fixing organisms that would enhance 
crop yields to a greater extent than the wild-type strains. Some researchers even 
went so far as to suggest that bacterial genes for nitrogen fixation might be intro-
duced directly into plants to enable them to fix their own nitrogen. While these 
ideas have not been realized, a consequence of this research is that a detailed 
understanding of the process of nitrogen fixation has emerged. And with this 
understanding, the possibility of improving the nitrogen-fixing activity of some 
diazotrophs by genetic manipulation is a little closer to becoming a reality.
All known nitrogenases have two oxygen-sensitive components. Component 
I is a complex of two identical α-protein sub-units (approximately 50,000 daltons 
each), two identical β-protein sub-units (approximately 60,000  daltons each), 24 
molecules of iron, 2 molecules of molybdenum, and an iron–molybdenum cofac-
tor, sometimes called FeMoCo (Fig.  2.5). Component II has two α-protein sub-
units (approximately 32,000 daltons each), which are not the same as the α-protein 
sub-units of component I, and a number of associated iron molecules. The catalysis 
of nitrogen to ammonium ion requires the combination of components I and II, a 
complex of magnesium and ATP, and a source of reducing equivalents (Fig. 2.6). In 
addition to fixing nitrogen, the nitrogenase can reduce the gas acetylene to ethylene. 
The measurement by gas chromatography of the increase in ethylene production (or 
the decrease in the acetylene level) as a function of time provides a convenient (and

commonly used) assay for nitrogenase activity. Component I catalyzes the actual 
reduction of N2, and component II donates electrons to component I (Fig.  2.7). 
Both components are extremely sensitive to oxygen and can be rapidly and irrevers-
ibly inactivated when the oxygen concentration is too high. In addition to compo-
nents I and II, the activity of a complete, functional nitrogenase depends on 15–20 
Fig. 2.4   Bacteroid metabolism. Dicarboxylic acids that were synthesized as a consequence of 
photosynthesis are taken up by the bacteroid. These acids are metabolized by the enzymes from 
the citric acid cycle. As a consequence and with the involvement of the electron transport chain 
proteins (embedded into the bacteroid membrane), ATP, which provides the energy for nitrogen 
fixation, is generated. The ammonia that is synthesized is transferred to glutamic acid to form 
glutamine, which is then transported throughout the plant. Oxygen is slowly released from a 
complex with bacterial leghemoglobin and is used in several of the above-mentioned enzymatic 
steps (not shown in this figure). Any excess sugars are converted to polyhydroxybutyrate, a car-
bon storage polymer, to be used at a later time

additional accessory proteins. The roles of most of the accessory proteins have been 
delineated and include the transfer of electrons to component II and the biosynthe-
sis of the iron–molybdenum cofactor that is a part of component I.
Nitrogen fixation is a very complicated process requiring the concerted 
actions of a large number of different proteins. Therefore, it was not realistic 
to expect either that an intact single DNA fragment containing all the genetic 
information for nitrogen fixation could be readily cloned from a diazotrophic 
microorganism and transferred into a non-diazotrophic organism or that a recipi-
ent organism could easily maintain the physiological conditions necessary for 
nitrogenase activity. In addition, the nitrogenase and many of the other compo-
nents of this system are highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen so that it is 
extremely difficult to purify and then biochemically characterize these proteins. 
Of course, the first time that genes involved in nitrogen fixation (nif genes) were 
isolated, and it was not possible to use previously isolated nif genes as DNA 
hybridization probes. Consequently at that time, the most direct way to isolate 
nif genes was to identify and characterize those clones of a wild-type library 
that restore nitrogen fixation to various mutants that were unable to fix nitro-
gen of the original organism. This process is called gene cloning by genetic 
complementation.
To isolate genes other than those that complement the above-mentioned muta-
tion that are involved in the nitrogen fixation process, isolated nif genes have been

used as DNA hybridization probes, which have then been used to screen a chro-
mosomal DNA clone bank that carries large (7–10 kb) inserts (Fig.  2.8). This 
scheme is based on the observation that in prokaryotic organisms, the genes cod-
ing for proteins in a pathway are typically clustered on the chromosomal DNA and

plasmids with fragments C and D. Once these fragments have been isolated and characterized, 
fragments C and D may be used, separately, as DNA hybridization probes to screen the same 
clone bank, in this case identifying clones containing plasmids with fragments B and E, respec-
tively. In this manner, a large contiguous section of the host chromosome may be isolated as a set 
of overlapping clones. © 2010 American Society for Microbiology. Used with permission. No

arranged in operons. Thus, DNA hybridization enables investigators to identify 
clones containing additional nif genes that are adjacent to the nif gene sequence 
that was initially isolated by complementation. And, once adjacent genes are iden-
tified, they may be characterized by DNA sequencing. In addition to being used 
to facilitate the isolation of the entire nif cluster, this technique of “walking down 
the chromosome” has been used to isolate nodulation (nod) and hydrogenase (hup) 
genes (discussed below).
The entire set of nif genes has been isolated and characterized from a number 
of different bacteria including both Rhizobia spp. and numerous rhizospheric and 
endophytic PGPB. These genes are typically arranged in a single cluster that occu-
pies ~24 kb of the bacterial genome, contains seven separate operons and encodes 
20 distinct proteins. All of the nif genes are transcribed and translated in a con-
certed fashion, under the regulatory control of the nifA and nifL genes, to produce 
a functional nitrogenase. The NifA protein is a positive regulatory factor. It turns 
on the transcription of all of the nif operons, except its own, by binding to a part 
of the promoter of each nif operon. The NifA protein is an enhancer binding pro-
tein that binds to specific DNA sequences located upstream of the nif genes and 
interacts with the transcription initiation protein sigma-54 (σ54) sub-unit of RNA 
polymerase before transcription from the nif promoter is initiated. The NifL pro-
tein is a negative regulatory factor; it is a flavoprotein that senses cellular redox 
status and binds to NifA to block its activity when conditions are not optimal for 
N2 fixation. In the presence of either oxygen or high levels of fixed nitrogen, it 
acts as an antagonist of the NifA protein and, as a result, turns off the transcription 
of all other nif genes. Most diazotrophic organisms have a similar array of genes 
encoding their nitrogen-fixing apparatus, and the DNA sequences of these genes 
do not vary much from one organism to another. However, not all nitrogen-fixing 
organisms have a NifL protein. In some organisms, the essential regions of NifL 
are part of NifA.
Increasing the amount of nitrogen that an organism can fix also increases the 
amount of energy, usually in the form of fixed carbon that is needed to power its 
metabolism. Consequently, a bacterium that has been engineered to fix a higher 
than normal level of nitrogen may lose its effectiveness as a plant growth-promot-
ing agent because of the diminished growth rate that results from depleting the 
cell’s ATP stores.
Genetic modification of plants with the entire nif gene cluster would likely not 
be effective because the normal level of oxygen in the host cells would inactivate 
nitrogenase. In addition, it is difficult to conceive how the regulation of nitro-
gen fixation could be achieved in plants, since there are no plant promoters that 
respond to the NifA protein. Consequently, nif genes would not be turned on in 
such a transgenic plant. Each of the nif genes would also have to be under the 
control of separate promoters because plant cells cannot process multi-gene tran-
scripts. The introduction of a functional nitrogen fixation capability into plants is 
therefore extremely unlikely.

39
While there may not be any straightforward and obvious way to increase 
nitrogen fixation by manipulating nif genes, several indirect strategies are worth 
considering. For example, since nitrogen fixation is a highly energy intensive pro-
cess, any genetic manipulation that increases the cell’s energy supply might also 
increase the amount of fixed nitrogen. Normally, in the presence of high levels of 
carbon (glucose) sources, the excess carbon is converted into glycogen, a carbon 
storage compound (Fig. 2.9). However, a deletion mutation in the gene that codes 
for the enzyme glycogen synthase prevents glycogen synthesis so that the glucose 
enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle where the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA 
is degraded to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The hydrogen (or the corre-
sponding electrons) is fed into the electron transport chain and the energy that is 
released is conserved by phosphorylation of three molecules of ADP to ATP. The

mutated Rhizobium increases the nodule number and plant biomass (in the field as 
well as in the laboratory). Unfortunately, because its metabolism is geared toward 
“burning off” a significant portion of the carbon intake and synthesizing more 
ATP, the modified Rhizobium strain is less persistent in the soil.
The concentration of oxygen is an important factor in determining the amount 
of nitrogen that is fixed by a rhizobial strain. On the one hand, oxygen is inhibi-
tory to nitrogenase and is also a negative regulator of nif gene expression. On the 
other hand, oxygen is required for bacteroid respiration. This conundrum can be 
resolved by the introduction of leghemoglobin, which binds free oxygen tightly 
so that both the transcription of nif genes and the functioning of nitrogenase can 
proceed unimpaired. In fact, the addition of exogenous leghemoglobin to isolated 
bacteroids results in a dramatic increase in nitrogenase activity. Thus, it is possible 
to engineer more efficient strains of Rhizobium by overproducing leghemoglobin. 
Alternatively, since the globin portion of the leghemoglobin molecule is produced 
by the plant, it may be more efficient to transform rhizobial strains with genes 
encoding a bacterial equivalent of leghemoglobin.
Following the transformation of a strain of Rhizobium etli with a broad-host-
range plasmid carrying the Vitreoscilla sp. (a gram-negative microaerophilic bac-
terium) hemoglobin gene at low levels of dissolved oxygen in the growth medium, 
the rhizobial cells had a 2- to 3-fold higher respiratory rate than the non-trans-
formed strain (Fig.  2.10). In greenhouse experiments, when bean plants were

inoculated with either non-transformed or bacterial hemoglobin-containing R. etli, 
the plants inoculated with the hemoglobin-containing strain had approximately 
68  % more nitrogenase activity. This difference in nitrogenase activity led to a 
25–30 % increase in leaf nitrogen content and a 16 % increase in the nitrogen con-
tent of the seeds that are produced. It remains to be seen whether this genetically 
modified strain is as effective in the field as in the greenhouse and whether the 
regulatory authorities will approve its use in the field.
In Latin America, a majority of the bean plants are nodulated by R. etli. One 
strain of R. etli that is in common use in Latin America encodes three copies of 
the nitrogenase component II, which is also called nitrogenase reductase, encoded 
by the nifH gene(s), with each of these genes under the transcriptional control of 
a separate promoter. To increase the amount of nitrogenase in R. etli, the strong-
est of the three nifH promoters (i.e., PnifHc) was coupled to the nifHcDK operon, 
which encodes the nitrogenase structural genes (where nifHc is one of the three 
nifH genes in this bacterium). The nifHc promoter is typically induced during nod-
ule development. The PnifHc–nifHcDK construct was cloned into a broad-host-
range plasmid and introduced into the wild-type strain of R. etli. The net result 
of this genetic manipulation was a significant increase in nitrogenase activity, 
plant dry weight, seed yield, and the nitrogen content of the seeds (Table  2.2). 
Moreover, this genetic manipulation worked as well or better when the PnifHc–
nifHcDK construct was introduced into the large Sym plasmid from R. etli that 
contains all of the genetic information for nodulation and nitrogen fixation.
Biological nitrogen fixation requires a large amount of energy in the form of 
ATP (Fig. 2.6). Thus, any mutation or genetic manipulation that increases the flux 
of carbon sources consumed by a bacterium through the citric acid cycle should 
be beneficial for nitrogen fixation (Fig. 2.11). This is because metabolism of glu-
cose via the citric acid cycle results in the production of ATP. Consistent with this 
principle, it was observed that expression of the PnifHc–nifHcDK construct in a 
poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-negative strain of R. etli enhanced plant growth to an 
even greater extent than when this construct was expressed in a wild-type poly-β-
hydroxybutyrate-positive strain. Finally, since no foreign genes were introduced

into R. etli, the scientists who constructed these strains hope that the regulatory 
bodies in their country will view the manipulated strains as benign and approve 
them for widespread environmental use.
As a direct result of worldwide industrialization and the burning of fossil fuels, 
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing for the past 
100 years or so and contributing to global warming. Recently, researchers reported 
that by directed mutagenesis they were able to alter the specificity of the nitroge-
nase enzyme so that it was able to reduce carbon dioxide to methane (Fig. 2.12a). 
This change in the specificity of nitrogenase occurred as a consequence of chang-
ing two amino acid residues in the alpha sub-unit of component I; the Val at posi-
tion 70 was changed to Ala and the His at position 195 was changed to Gln. These 
two amino acid substitutions altered the protein environment around the FeMo 
cofactor. These amino acid changes were made on the basis of previous experi-
ments that showed that the protein environment immediately surrounding the 
FeMo cofactor control both the size of compounds that can be nitrogenase sub-
strates and the reactivity of the FeMo cofactor toward those compounds. In addi-
tion to converting carbon dioxide to methane, the modified nitrogenase was able to 
catalyze the synthesis of propylene through the reductive coupling of carbon diox-
ide and acetylene (Fig. 2.12b). These chemical reactions occur at faster rates than 
any other enzymatic conversions of carbon dioxide to methane and require only a 
single enzyme, whereas other systems utilize a consortium of enzymes. However, 
the modified nitrogenase, like the native enzyme, does use considerable energy in 
the form of ATP. This work is only the first step in what is hoped will eventually 
be an efficient and clean means of converting unwanted greenhouse gases (carbon 
dioxide) into industrially useful compounds.
2.1.2.2  Nodulation
A major goal of agricultural biotechnology research is the development, by 
genetic manipulation, of Rhizobium strains that can increase plant productivity 
more effectively than naturally occurring strains. In this regard, many commercial 
inoculant strains that have been developed by traditional mutation and selection to 
be superior nitrogen fixers are not very effective at establishing nodules on host 
plant roots when placed in competition with Rhizobium strains that are already 
present in the soil. Conversely, although many of the strains that are indigenous 
to the soil are highly successful in establishing nodules in competitive situations,

they are often not especially efficient at nitrogen fixation. It would therefore be 
advantageous to be able to increase the nodulation capability of commercial inocu-
lant strains that were previously selected for their ability at nitrogen fixation. The 
question then arises, what is the genetic basis of this effective “competitiveness” at 
nodulation.
When scientists first attempted to isolate nodulation (nod) genes, the absence 
of any specific information about the biochemical or genetic basis of nodula-
tion meant that a strategy had to be devised for the identification of the genes. 
Therefore, the technique of genetic complementation was used. Nodulation-
defective (Nod−) mutants of Sinorhizobium meliloti (a strain that nodulates alfalfa, 
Medicago; sweet clover, Melilotus; and fenugreek, Trigonella) were transformed 
with a clone bank of wild-type S. meliloti chromosomal DNA, and those colonies 
that had acquired the ability to nodulate alfalfa roots were isolated. Once a single 
nodulation gene was identified, it was used as a DNA hybridization probe to “walk 
down the chromosome” and identify adjacent regions of the S. meliloti chromo-
somal DNA.
The isolation and characterization of the complete repertoire of nodulation 
genes from S. meliloti (and subsequently other rhizobial species) revealed that, 
similar to nitrogen fixation, nodulation and its regulation is a complex process that 
requires the functioning of a large number of genes. Some nodulation genes are 
highly conserved (i.e., common) among nodulating bacteria, and others are species 
specific. The nod genes are grouped into three separate classes: common genes, 
host-specific genes, and the regulatory nodD gene. Thus, for example, the nodABC 
genes are common to all Rhizobium species, are structurally interchangeable, and 
in most species they are found on a single operon.
The bacterium S. meliloti has been shown to utilize chemotaxis to optimize 
its movement toward host plant-secreted nutrients that act as chemo-attractants. 
This enables this bacterium (and others) to locate infection sites along emerging 
roots and, as a result, to compete more effectively for nodulation. Germinating 
seeds exude a wide range of organic compounds, and alfalfa seed exudates elic-
ited a chemotactic response from S. meliloti (Fig. 2.13). The early recruitment of 
the microbial symbiont to the growing root, e.g., during seed germination, is one 
strategy for maximizing the rhizobia–legume interaction. Earlier research had sug-
gested that flavonoids act as host-specific chemo-attractants; however, they elicit 
only a weak chemotactic response and have only a short diffusion range in aque-
ous soil due to their hydrophobic nature. Thus, amino acids, organic acids, and 
sugars are more likely to function as recruiting agents, thereby facilitating the ini-
tial binding of the bacterium to the plant.
Subsequently, a number of events occur during nodulation (Fig. 2.14a). First, 
the nodD gene product, which is constitutively expressed, recognizes and binds to 
a flavonoid molecule, which is excreted by the roots of the potential host plants. 
Flavonoids are a class of plant secondary metabolites that perform a number of 
different functions for the plant, such as pigmentation and defense against fungi or 
insects. The binding of flavonoids to the NodD protein is the major determinant of 
rhizobial host specificity, because each rhizobial species recognizes only a limited 

45
number of flavonoid structures and each plant species produces its own specific set 
of flavonoid molecules (Table 2.3). Some strains, such as R. leguminosarum bio-
var (bv.) trifolii, have a very narrow host range, responding to only a few kinds of 
flavonoids, while others, such as Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234, have a very broad 
host range and respond to a much larger number of different flavonoids.
The binding of a flavonoid molecule activates the NodD protein and enables the 
flavonoid–NodD complex to attach to a nodulation promoter element called a nod 
box (Fig. 2.14b). This promoter element is located upstream from all the nodula-
tion genes except the nodD gene, and it activates the transcription of these genes. 
The nodABC genes encode proteins that cause the plant root hair tips to swell and 
curl, the initial step in the infection of the plant root by the bacterium. The bacteria 
synthesize an oligosaccharide nod factor (Fig. 2.15) that elicits in the plant a host-
specific response that includes root hair curling and deformation and is essential 
for Rhizobium to induce nodules. After the initial change in the root morphology, 
the bacterium attaches to the root hair. Next, the bacterial cell penetrates the plant 
cell through an infection thread. As the bacterial cell divides, it moves through the 
infection thread. Finally, a number of additional nod gene products are synthe-
sized. These proteins, together with some plant-encoded proteins, contribute to the 
formation of the nodule.
It has become clear that the process of nodulation is quite complicated. Thus, 
considerable additional effort will be required before it is possible to further 
enhance the competitiveness of rhizobial strains by genetic engineering. To date, 
despite the fact that nod genes have been isolated and characterized from numer-
ous rhizobial strains, no simple genetic means has been devised for using nod

genes to enable inoculated strains of Rhizobium to outcompete indigenous strains. 
Nevertheless, it is possible to alter host specificity by the transfer of a nodD gene 
from a broad-specificity rhizobial strain to one with narrow specificity.
Ethylene is often produced by a plant following the plant’s infection by a soil 
microorganism such as a strain of rhizobia. Thus, nodule formation engenders a 
small rise in the plant ethylene level that is generally localized to a portion of the 
root and can inhibit, and therefore limit, subsequent rhizobial infection and nodu-
lation. One way in which some strains of Rhizobium naturally increase the number 
of nodules that they can form on the roots of a host legume is to limit the rise 
in ethylene that occurs following the initial infection. Different Rhizobium species 
decrease ethylene levels either by synthesizing a small molecule called rhizobi-
toxin that chemically inhibits ACC synthase, one of the ethylene biosynthetic

enzymes, or by producing the enzyme ACC deaminase and cleaving and hence 
removing some of the ACC before it can be converted to ethylene. The result 
of lowering the local level of ethylene in plant roots is that both the number of 
nodules and the biomass of the plant are increased by 25–40 %. Assays of iso-
lated rhizobia indicate that in the field approximately 1–10 % of rhizobial strains 
naturally possess ACC deaminase. It should therefore be possible to increase the 
nodulation efficiency of Rhizobium strains that lack ACC deaminase by geneti-
cally engineering these strains with isolated Rhizobium ACC deaminase genes

(and their regulatory regions). In fact, insertion of a single copy of an ACC deami-
nase gene from R. leguminosarum bv. viciae into the chromosomal DNA of a 
strain of S. meliloti that lacked this enzyme dramatically increased both the nod-
ule numbers and biomass of host alfalfa plants (Fig. 2.16). Although genetically 
engineered strains of Rhizobium are generally not acceptable for use in the field in 
most jurisdictions throughout the world at this time, as a result of this work, sev-
eral commercial inoculant producers have recently begun screening newly isolated 
Rhizobium strains for active ACC deaminase.
In addition to insuring that rhizobial inoculants contain ACC deaminase and 
thereby insuring an increased number of nodules and a higher plant biomass, dual 
inoculation of pea plants with strains of R. leguminosarum and Pseudomonas 
putida synergistically improves plant growth, nodulation, and seed yield 
(Table 2.4). In this case, despite the fact that both strains contained ACC deami-
nase, the presence of the two strains always produced the largest and healthiest 
plants and the greatest yield of peas. Moreover, this inoculation was more effective

than the addition of optimal levels of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer, and this 
effect was significant both in the greenhouse and in the field. Thus, not only can 
rhizobial inoculants be improved by selecting for the presence of ACC deaminase, 
but also additional growth improvements are possible when a dual inoculation 
strategy is employed.
2.1.2.3  Hydrogenase
An undesirable side reaction of the fixation of nitrogen by nitrogenase is the 
reduction of H+ to hydrogen gas (H2) (Fig. 2.17). In this reaction, energy in the 
form of ATP is wasted on the production of hydrogen, which is eventually lost 
to the atmosphere. This side reaction significantly lowers the overall efficiency of 
the nitrogen-fixing process. However, if H2 could be recycled to H+, the extent 
of energy loss could be diminished and the nitrogen-fixing process would become 
more efficient. This side reaction cannot be prevented directly because it is a con-
sequence of the chemistry of the active site of the nitrogenase; hence, it is not pos-
sible to alter nitrogenase as a means of blocking hydrogen production.
On the other hand, some strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum (as well as other 
Rhizobia) have an enzyme called hydrogenase that can take up H2 from the atmos-
phere and convert it into H+ and in the process produce ATP that can be used to 
fix more nitrogen (Fig. 2.17). In addition, plants inoculated with strains that pro-
duce hydrogenase (they are said to be hydrogen uptake positive or Hup+) have 
more biomass and nitrogen than plants that are treated with strains that do not pro-
duce hydrogenase (i.e., they are Hup−), independent of the level of nitrogenase 
activity in the Hup− strains (Table 2.5). Thus, the presence of a hydrogen uptake 
system in a symbiotic diazotroph, such as B. japonicum, improves the ability of 
a bacterium to stimulate plant growth, presumably by binding and then recycling 
Fig. 2.17   Recycling of the hydrogen gas that is produced as a by-product of nitrogen fixation. 
When it is present, hydrogenase captures the hydrogen gas and converts it into H+ and ATP

the H2 that is formed inside the nodule by the action of nitrogenase (Fig. 2.17). 
Although it is clearly beneficial to the plant to obtain its nitrogen from a symbiotic 
diazotroph that has a hydrogen uptake system, this trait is not commonly found in 
naturally occurring rhizobial strains so that Hup− rhizobial strains are prime can-
didates for genetic transformation to a Hup+ phenotype.
However, the conversion of a Hup− strain of Rhizobium into a Hup+ strain 
may not be readily achieved by the introduction of just a single hydrogenase gene. 
Rather, the introduced gene(s) must encode all of the enzyme’s sub-units and must 
be able to interact with the appropriate electron transport molecule within the host 
organism.
The most common strategy for isolating hydrogenase genes has been genetic 
complementation followed by walking down the chromosome. In this regard, hup 
genes from B. japonicum were isolated from a clone bank of wild-type DNA con-
structed in the broad-host-range cosmid vector pLAFR1 by complementation of B. 
japonicum Hup− mutants. The presence of a hydrogenase that takes up hydrogen 
from the atmosphere in the complemented Hup− mutant strains was indicated by 
the ability of the active hydrogenase to reduce the dye methylene blue in a hydro-
gen atmosphere and thereby change its color. Detailed studies of the B. japoni-
cum hup genes showed that they were organized into several transcriptional units 
covering approximately 20  kb of the genome and including 18 separate genes. 
Subsequent studies, on the hup genes from Rhizobium leguminosarum, have indi-
cated that these genes are similar in both DNA sequence and gene organization to 
the hup genes from B. japonicum.
Following the isolation of the complete complement of R. leguminosarum 
hup genes, and despite the complexity of this system, it is possible to use cos-
mid vectors to transfer all of these genes, originally from a naturally occurring 
Hup+ strain of R. leguminosarum, to a naturally occurring Hup− strain (Table 2.6). 
Plants treated with R. leguminosarum that had been transformed to Hup+ grew 
larger and contained more nitrogen than the plants inoculated with the Hup− 
parental strain. Thus, the ability of a diazotroph to stimulate plant growth may be 
improved, albeit directly, by genetic manipulation.

In R. leguminosarum, 17 genes are associated with hydrogenase activity. There 
are ten hup genes (hup SLCDEFGHIJK) responsible for the structural compo-
nents of the hydrogenase, the processing of the enzyme, and electron transport 
(Fig. 2.18). There are also seven hyp (hydrogenase pleiotropic) genes (hypABFC-
DEX), which are involved in processing the nickel that is part of the active center 
of the enzyme. The hup promoter is dependent on the NifA protein (which is also 
required to activate the synthesis of nif genes), so that hup genes are expressed 
only within bacteroids. On the other hand, the hyp genes are transcriptionally regu-
lated by an FnrN-dependent promoter (Fnr = fumarate-nitrate reduction regulator), 
which is switched on when the cellular levels of oxygen are low (i.e., under micro-
aerobic conditions). Thus, the hyp genes are typically expressed in bacteroids.
Modifying the chromosomal DNA of R. leguminosarum and exchanging the 
hup promoter for an FnrN-dependent promoter (Fig. 2.18) enabled researchers to

create a derivative of the wild-type bacterium with an increased level of hydroge-
nase activity. The engineered R. leguminosarum strain displays a twofold increase 
in hydrogenase activity compared to the wild-type and a sixfold decrease in the 
amount of H2 that is produced as a by-product of nitrogen fixation. In the trans-
formed strain, the amount of hydrogen evolved from nitrogen-fixing nodules was 
extremely low, indicating that virtually all of the hydrogen produced by nitroge-
nase was recycled. This is expected to make this strain of R. leguminosarum much 
more effective at promoting plant growth and increasing plant nitrogen content. 
When the effectiveness of the engineered strain of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae 
was tested with a variety of different legume hosts, all of the legumes tested with 
the notable exception of lentils displayed an increased level of hydrogen uptake 
hydrogenase activity in bacteroids and as a consequence a decreased level of 
hydrogen evolution (Table 2.7). At this point, it is not clear why different legume 
hosts respond so differently to the presence of the introduced R. leguminosarum.
2.2  Sequestering Iron
Living organisms, animals, plants, and microorganisms, all require iron as a com-
ponent of proteins involved in important processes such as respiration, photosyn-
thesis, and nitrogen fixation. Despite the abundance of iron on the earth’s surface, 
soil organisms such as plants and microbes cannot readily assimilate enough iron 
to support their growth because the iron in soil is largely present as insoluble, fer-
ric (Fe+3) hydroxides, which is only sparingly soluble and cannot be readily trans-
ported into cells. To solve this problem, bacteria, fungi, and some plants secrete 
low molecular mass (~400–1,000 Da), specialized iron-binding molecules called 
siderophores into the soil to scavenge iron. Siderophores bind to Fe+3 with an

exceptionally high affinity (i.e., Kd = 10−20 to 10−50). Once bound, the now solu-
ble iron–siderophore complex is taken up by specific receptors on the exposed sur-
faces of microorganisms or plants (Fig. 2.19); following reduction to the ferrous 
state (Fe+2), the iron is released from the siderophore.
The promotion of plant growth by siderophore-producing bacteria occurs by 
either directly supplying iron for plant utilization and/or by removing iron from 
the environment of phytopathogens, thereby reducing their competitiveness.
2.2.1  Siderophore Structure
Siderophores are low molecular weight molecules, usually less than 1  kDa, 
with three functional, or iron-binding, groups connected via a flexible backbone 
(Fig.  2.20). Each functional group has two oxygen atoms, or less commonly, 
nitrogen, that bind to iron. The functional groups are bidentate, and trivalent fer-
ric iron can accommodate three of these groups to form a six-coordinate complex. 
The functional groups on microbial siderophores are typically hydroxamates or 
catecholates; however, other functional groups including carboxylate moieties 
such as citrate and ethylenediamine are also commonly used (Fig. 2.21). Different 
combinations of these functional groups may be present on a single siderophore 
molecule. In general, hydroxamate-type siderophores are typical to fungi, while 
catecholates, which bind iron more tightly than hydroxamates, are common in

bacterial siderophores. Plant siderophores, which bind iron much less tightly than 
microbial siderophores, are linear hydroxy- and amino-substituted iminocarbox-
ylic acids, such as mugineic acid and avenic acid. Although many molecules with 
negatively charged donor groups are able to bind to iron, they do so with a much 
lower affinity than bacterial siderophores. Other trivalent metal ions, such as alu-
minum, also bind bacterial siderophores, albeit with a lower affinity. Most envi-
ronmental metals, however, are divalent and less electronegative and therefore do 
not bind tightly to bacterial siderophores.
Enormous structural diversity exists among the hundreds of known sidero-
phores, even among the multiple siderophores synthesized by a single organism. 
Thus, for example, various Psuedomonas spp. produce two major types of sidero-
phores, pyochelin and pyoverdin (Fig.  2.22). Pyochelins are phenolate sidero-
phores derived from salicylic acid and cysteine; two pyochelin molecules bind one 
molecule of ferric iron with a relatively low efficiency. Pyoverdins have a much 
greater affinity for iron; they are water-soluble pigments that fluoresce yellow-
green under ultraviolet light giving the fluorescent pseudomonads their character-
istic appearance.

2.2.2  Siderophore Biosynthesis Genes
Given the structural diversity that exists between siderophores from different bac-
teria, the isolation of siderophore biosynthesis genes is not necessarily simple or 
straightforward. One reliable approach to the isolation of siderophore biosynthe-
sis genes utilizes the strategy of cloning by complementation (discussed earlier). 
Thus, it is necessary to first isolate a series of mutants in siderophore biosynthesis. 
In one instance, the PGPB P. putida WCS358 was first mutagenized and 28 sidero-
phore-deficient mutants were selected by (i) lack of fluorescence under ultraviolet 
light and (ii) the inability to grow in the presence of bipyridyl, a molecule that 
sequesters most of the iron in the growth medium. When most of the iron is una-
vailable, only a cell that produces siderophores can grow.
A clone bank of P. putida WCS358 DNA was then constructed in the broad-
host-range cosmid vector pLAFR1 and was introduced by conjugation into each 
of the 28 siderophore-deficient mutants (Fig. 2.23). All of the resultant transfor-
mants were tested by complementation for restoration of fluorescence and/or the 
ability to grow in the presence of bipyridyl. Thirteen separate complementing 
cosmid clones, with an average insert size of 26 kb, were identified. Following 
detailed analyses, these clones were found to represent at least five separate gene 
clusters. When one of these gene clusters was studied in detail, it was found to 
have a length of 33.5 kb and to contain five transcriptional units with at least seven 
separate genes. Additional siderophore biosynthesis genes were isolated using the 
technique of walking down the chromosome described earlier. Thus, similar to 
nitrogen fixation and nodulation, siderophore biosynthesis is a complex process 
involving a number of different genes. Therefore, genetically engineering bacte-
ria to produce modified siderophores is not a simple matter. However, it may be 
possible to extend the range of iron–siderophore complexes that one bacterial 
strain can utilize so that a genetically altered plant growth-promoting biocon-
trol bacterial strain could take up and use siderophores synthesized by other soil

microorganisms, thereby giving it a competitive advantage. This was achieved 
when the genes for iron–siderophore receptors from one PGPB were isolated and 
then introduced into other PGPB strains.
2.2.3  Regulation of Iron Uptake
The bound iron must also be taken up and released into bacterial or plant cells to 
become available for their metabolism. Because siderophores are hydrophilic, they 
rely on membrane-bound proteins for transportation across cell membranes. Once 
inside the cell, iron is released from the siderophore–iron complex to be availa-
ble for use in metabolic processes. For this to happen, either the siderophore is

on bipyridyl (because they do not produce siderophores and therefore cannot take up the trace 
amounts of iron in the medium in competition with the bipyridyl) were complemented using a 
clone bank of wild-type DNA in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR1. Transformants that can 
grow in the presence of bipyridyl do so because they can complement the mutation in one of the 
siderophore biosynthesis genes. © 2010 American Society for Microbiology. Used with permis-

enzymatically cleaved or the ferric iron is reduced to the ferrous state. To this end, 
researchers have identified (i) some esterases that can cleave siderophores (and 
release iron as a consequence of reduced affinity) and (ii) some reductases that 
can reduce bound ferric iron (which is then released from the siderophore–iron 
complex).
Transcription of most of the genes whose products are involved in sidero-
phore synthesis and iron transport is activated under conditions of iron limitation. 
In pseudomonads, the cellular concentration of iron is sensed by “Fur,” an iron-
binding protein. When cellular levels of iron are sufficient, this cytoplasmic pro-
tein binds ferrous iron and represses the transcription of iron-regulated genes. A 
Fur-binding consensus sequence, called the Fur-box, has been found in the pro-
moter regions of a number of Pseudomonas (and other PGPB) genes. In addition, 
siderophore biosynthesis and ferric–siderophore receptor genes are regulated and 
are activated when iron is limited.
2.2.4  Siderophores in the Rhizosphere
In pseudomonads, as many as fifteen enzymes are involved in the synthesis of 
some pyoverdin siderophores, and a number of additional proteins are required for 
the transport of ferric–siderophore complexes and in the regulation of siderophore 
and receptor expression. The simplest explanation for why microbes have invested 
such a significant amount of their resources to synthesize and utilize siderophores 
would suggest that these resources are needed because iron is essential for sur-
vival. In addition, the ability to obtain iron efficiently in an iron limited environ-
ment and at the expense of other microbes provides a means for a bacterium to 
compete for limited resources in the rhizosphere.
Synthesis of siderophores enables microbes to scavenge environmental iron, but 
several factors contribute to the success of those siderophores in binding the iron. 
The amount of siderophore produced is an important factor. Because the binding 
relationship between siderophore and iron is stoichiometric, the more siderophore 
molecules available, the more iron that can be bound. In addition, the greater the 
affinity the siderophore has for iron and the faster the rate of association of the 
iron and siderophore, the more success the bacterium will have in obtaining iron. 
However, in order to bind iron, siderophores must lose protons. Therefore, to form 
a stable complex with iron is, in part, a function of its tendency to lose protons that 
in turn is influenced by rhizosphere pH. The association of siderophore and iron is 
thus reduced in acidic soils; however, ferric iron is reduced to a more soluble fer-
rous state in acidic conditions and therefore siderophore-mediated iron chelation is 
not as critical for iron acquisition under these conditions. The more protons that a 
siderophore has to lose, the more pH dependent it is.
In the rhizosphere, the capacity to produce large amounts of high affinity 
siderophores may not to be as important for bacterial competition and root colo-
nization as the ability to utilize a variety of different ferric–siderophores. Thus, 
2.2  Sequestering Iron

58
2  Resource Acquisition
the expression of relatively nonspecific receptors that can bind a range of ferric–
siderophores or the production of several siderophore receptors with different 
binding specificities gives a bacterium a competitive edge on the plant surface.
The best competitors therefore are those that can utilize a broad range of 
siderophores and at the same time produce siderophores that few other microbes 
can use. Some pseudomonads produce outer membrane receptors that recognize a 
variety of ferric–siderophores and also secrete siderophores that most other bacte-
ria are unable to bind and thus are particularly effective biocontrol agents. By the 
use of genetic engineering to extend the spectrum of siderophores that a PGPB can 
recognize, it may be possible to increase the capacity of these bacteria to facilitate 
plant growth.
Siderophores may also help to alleviate the stress imposed on plants by high 
soil levels of heavy metals. Kluyvera ascorbata, a siderophore-producing PGPB, 
was able to protect plants from heavy metal (nickel, lead, and zinc) toxicity. 
Moreover, a siderophore-overproducing mutant of this bacterium provided even 
greater protection, in three different plants (canola, Indian mustard, and tomato) 
cultivated in nickel contaminated soil. In this case, the siderophores of K. ascor-
bata are directly supplying iron to the contaminated plants, thereby relieving them 
of iron deficiency, a symptom of heavy metal toxicity.
2.3  Solubilizing Phosphorus
Plant growth requires a significant amount of phosphorus, a key component in 
both cell membranes and nucleic acids. Fortunately, most soils contain quite a 
lot of phosphorus (~400–1,200  mg/kg of soil). However, most of the phospho-
rus in soil is insoluble and is therefore not available to support plant growth. 
Thus, the amount of soluble phosphorus in many soils is ~1 mg/kg of soil. The 
insoluble phosphorus includes both inorganic and organic forms. The organic 
phosphorus in soil (typically ~30–50  % of the total) is mostly in the form of 
inositol hexaphosphate (phytate) that is the principal storage form of phospho-
rus in plants (Fig.  2.24). Phytate is not digestible by humans or non-ruminant 
animals. Moreover, phytate is not bioavailable to plants as plant roots generally 
produce only very low levels of phytases, the enzymes that break down phytate. 
Nevertheless, a number of different microorganisms (both bacteria and fungi) 
readily degrade phytate. In addition to phytate, some of the other forms of organic 
phosphate found in the soil include phosphomonoesters and phosphotriesters that 
can be broken down by various phosphatases.
The inorganic forms of phosphorus include minerals such as apatite. Apatite 
is really a group of phosphate minerals that includes hydroxyapatite, fluorapatite, 
and chloroapatite. Hydroxyapatite is also the major component of tooth enamel 
and bone mineral. Apatite is often ground into a powder and used as a fertilizer 
as a source of phosphorus. Plants and bacteria typically solubilize inorganic 

59
phosphorus through the production and secretion of small organic acids such as 
gluconic, citric, lactic, 2-ketogluconic, oxalic, tartaric, and acetic acid. These 
organic acids act as chelating agents that solubilize minerals that contain phos-
phorus, and in the process they sometimes solubilize some other nutrients at the 
same time. Unfortunately, a considerable fraction of the soluble inorganic phos-
phorus that is used by farmers as a chemical fertilizer is immobilized soon after 
it is applied. This means that much of this chemical phosphorus fertilizer that is 
applied is unavailable to plants and is therefore wasted and ultimately contributes 
to eutrophication (i.e., the run-off of nutrients from fields into bodies of water 
where these nutrients are likely to promote algal growth).
One simple way of testing whether a PGPB strain can solubilize inorganic 
phosphorus is to plate the bacterium on solid medium that contains inorganic 
phosphorus and, following growth of the bacterium, look for a halo or zone of 
clearance around the bacterial colony (Fig. 2.25). Such a zone of clearance indi-
cates that the bacterium is synthesizing and secreting organic acids that solubilize 
that inorganic phosphorus. This simple plate assay may also serve to facilitate the 
isolation of genes involved in organic acid production.

60
2  Resource Acquisition
It is important to note that sometimes the same bacterial strain can naturally 
solubilize both organic and inorganic forms of phosphorus. This also means that 
it is possible to engineer more efficient strains of phosphorus-solubilizing bacte-
ria. In one experiment, a phytase gene was isolated from the fungus Aspergillus 
fumigatus, placed under the control of a bacterial promoter and, with a transpo-
son, inserted into the chromosomal DNA of Bacillus mucilaginosus that can dis-
solve inorganic phosphorus. When this transformed bacterium was tested in both 
greenhouse and field experiments, it was more efficient at providing phosphorus 
to tobacco plants than the non-transformed strain of this bacterium (Table 2.8). 
While, it is currently unlikely that any genetically engineered strain will be 
approved for widespread environmental dissemination, this is an important step in 
trying to overcome the inconsistent and disappointing results observed so far in the 
employment of naturally occurring phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria. Finally, it is 
possible that in nature, phosphorus solubilization is not preformed exclusively by 
naturally occurring phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria but rather includes a variety 
of soil fungi (such as mycorrhizae) as well.

Most, if not all, of the physiological activity of a plant is regulated by one or more 
plant hormones (phytohormones) including auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic 
acid, ethylene, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and brassinosteroids. In addition to 
plants, many soil bacteria are also capable of synthesizing and/or modulating the 
level of some of these hormones including auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, and ethyl-
ene (Fig. 3.1). It should be emphasized here that phytohormones are not nutrients, 
but rather are chemicals that are typically present in plants in very low concentra-
tions and promote and influence the growth, development, and differentiation of 
plant cells and tissues. Phytohormones help plants to adjust their growth rates and 
patterns in response to a wide range of environmental and developmental condi-
tions. By modulating different aspects of a plant’s environmental and developmen-
tal responses, phytohormones turn on (or off) various plant genes that ultimately 
help to optimize a plant’s growth and development.
It is necessary to bear in mind that despite having precise analytical tech-
niques for measuring phytohormone levels, with systems containing both plants 
and PGPB, it is extremely difficult to separate the contribution to the total made 
by each of the partners. One biological approach to this issue is the construc-
tion and testing of either plant or bacterial mutants in phytohormone synthesis or 
degradation.
3.1  Auxin
The mechanism that is most often used to explain the positive effects of plant growth-
promoting bacteria is the production of phytohormones, and the phytohormone that 
has received most of the attention is auxin. Several naturally occurring auxins are 
known although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is by far the most common (Fig. 3.2).

In fact, the terms auxin and IAA are often used interchangeably. Some precursors of 
IAA, for example, indole-3-acetonitrile, may also have auxin activity. Other endog-
enous auxins include indole-3-butyric acid, which is synthesized from IAA. Several 
synthetic auxins with enhanced efficacy or specialized application are commercially 
available. For example, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-
acetic acid (2,4-D) are often used in tissue culture to stimulate plant organogenesis 
from callus cells, and in horticulture to promote the rooting of cuttings. Application of 
4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionic acid in orchards can 
stimulate fruit set and prevent fruit abscission, respectively.
Auxins are involved in the response of root and shoot growth to light and gravity, 
differentiation of vascular tissue, apical dominance, initiation of lateral and adven-
titious roots, stimulation of cell division, and elongation of stems and roots. The 
auxin concentration is critical to the plant’s response. Plant factors that influence 
auxin levels include both plant and bacterial synthesis and degradation, as well as 
conjugate formation. Auxin conjugates are thought to play important roles as stor-
age forms for the active plant hormone IAA. In its free form, IAA comprises only 
up to 25 % of the total amount of IAA in a plant, depending on the particular tissue 
and the plant species studied.
Different plants are sensitive to different levels of auxin. In addition, the opti-
mal level of auxin to promote plant growth is ~5 orders of magnitude lower for 
roots than it is for shoots (Fig. 3.3). The existing level of plant-synthesized IAA is 
important in determining whether bacterial IAA will stimulate or inhibit growth. 
Plant IAA levels may be either sub-optimal or optimal (i.e., too little or just right). 
Input of IAA by bacteria may change that to either optimal or supraoptimal (just 
right or too much). Thus, the observation that inoculation with a PGPB strain that

produced IAA stimulated root development in black currant cuttings but inhibited 
root development in sour cherry cuttings has been interpreted as suggesting that 
IAA from the bacterium elevated IAA in black currant to an optimal level for root 
growth while sour cherry IAA levels became inhibitory.
A very large percentage of rhizosphere bacteria (typically ~85 %) have been 
found to synthesize IAA. This is probably an indication that IAA biosynthesis is 
an essential (or at least very important) component of the functioning and metabo-
lism of these bacteria, possibly for functions other than plant growth promotion. 
To ensure that they produce sufficient levels of IAA, many soil bacteria have a 
high affinity for tryptophan thereby allowing them to scavenge tryptophan even 
when only very low levels are available.
3.1.1  Biosynthetic Pathways
Although IAA was first discovered at the end of the nineteenth century, it is only 
in recent years, with the complete sequencing of a large number of bacterial 
genomes, that the numerous pathways of IAA biosynthesis have been elaborated. 
Interestingly, in many of the bacterial strains that have been examined in detail, 
there are often multiple pathways within a single organism seemingly encoding 
the biosynthesis of IAA. Moreover, these pathways sometimes intersect with one 
another, thereby posing difficulties when trying to characterize them. Of course, 
such a seemingly redundant multi-route system compensates for the loss of any 
particular pathway, as IAA production can readily be fluxed through an alternate 
route.
IAA biosynthetic pathways may be characterized either genetically or bio-
chemically. Genetic characterization of a given pathway involves the develop-
ment of either IAA-deficient mutants or IAA-overproducing strains with the 
under- or overproduction of a particular biosynthetic enzyme leading to a decrease 
or increase in IAA production. On the other hand, biochemical approaches aim 
to isolate and characterize the enzymes that catalyze IAA biosynthesis. This 
approach includes both substrate-feeding assays as well as structure–function 
studies of the relevant enzymes.
3.1.1.1  The IAM Pathway
IAA biosynthesis via the indole-3-acetamide (IAM) pathway occurs in both patho-
genic bacteria and PGPB but is best characterized in pathogens. In this pathway, 
IAA is produced in a two-step reaction from a tryptophan precursor (Fig.  3.4). 
The first enzyme is a tryptophan 2-monooxygenase that converts tryptophan to 
the indole-3-acetamide intermediate. The second reaction is catalyzed by an IAM-
specific hydrolase/amidase that hydrolyzes indole-3-acetamide to the final IAA 
product. The main genes of the IAM pathway are typically organized in an operon 

69
and have been found to be conserved between the phytopathogens Pseudomonas 
syringae pv. syringae, P. syringae pv. savastanoi, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
In A. tumefaciens, which infects host plants and causes crown gall formation, 
the genes are not functional inside the bacteria, but are transferred into the plant 
cell where they are inserted into the plant chromosome resulting in very high lev-
els of IAA production, which in turn leads to uncontrollable tumor growth. In 
P. syringae pv. savastanoi, these two genes are only functional inside the bacte-
rium and are not directly transferred into plant cells. In this case, the pathogen-
induced plant tumors depend on the continuous production of IAA by the infecting 
bacteria, with IAA-overproducing mutants displaying increased virulence and 
larger galls on the host plant. Conversely, mutants of this bacterium that have lost 
these genes are less virulent than the wild-type strain.
A phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the IAM pathway suggests that hom-
ologues of the iaaM gene exist in several bacterial genera and these sequences 
fall into two groups. Group I sequences are known to participate in IAA synthe-
sis, such as those encoding tryptophan 2-monooxygenases in the plant pathogens 
A. tumefaciens, P. syringae pv. savastanoi, Pantoea agglomerans, and D. dadan-
tii. Homologous iaaM-like sequences from Burkholderia spp., Agrobacterium 
spp., and a few other P. syringae strains also fall into this cluster. The Group II 
sequences are not well characterized, but homologues exist within more diverse 
bacteria, and it is not known whether tryptophan is a substrate of these group II 
gene products.
3.1.1.2  The IPA Pathway
This pathway is common among various strains of PGPB, but has also been 
found to exist in some phytopathogens. Initially, L-tryptophan is deaminated to 
indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) by an aminotransferase. Subsequently, a decarboxy-
lase converts indole-3-pyruvic acid into indole-3-acetylaldehyde (IAAld), which 
is then oxidized to IAA by aldehyde dehydrogenase, mutase, or oxidase enzymes 
(Fig.  3.5). There is an alternative pathway in which tryptophan is directly con-
verted into indole-3-acetylaldehyde by a tryptophan side chain monooxygenase 
enzyme (Fig.  3.5). This is known as the tryptophan side chain oxidase (TSO) 
Fig. 3.4   The indoleacetamide (IAM) pathway. Two enzymes are involved in this pathway: (A) 
tryptophan monooxygenase which converts tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide and (B) indoleacet-
amide hydrolase which converts indole-3-acetamide to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)
3.1  Auxin

pathway. The genes for the key enzymes of the IPA pathway, tryptophan ami-
notransferase, and IPA decarboxylase have been found encoded in several different 
bacterial genomes. However, there are no literature reports on the genes in bacteria 
responsible for the aldehyde oxidation step.
The second enzyme of the IPA pathway is an indole-3-pyruvic acid decar-
boxylase (IPDC), which is encoded by the ipdC gene. This gene has been cloned 
from several different bacteria including, Enterobacter, Azospirillum, and 
Erwinia. In one experiment, to prove that bacterial IAA is directly responsible for 
promoting plant growth, a strain of Enterobacter cloacae was genetically engi-
neered to create a mutant deficient in IAA production (Table 3.1). This mutant 
was created by inserting a foreign gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic kan-
amycin into the reading frame of the ipdC gene (Fig. 3.6). Following construction 
of this mutant strain, IAA production was quantified by HPLC in both wild-type 
and mutant strains of the PGPB (Table  3.2), with the mutant strain producing 
very low levels of IAA at all tryptophan concentrations. This result confirmed 
that the tested PGPB strain produced IAA predominantly via the IPA pathway. 
Moreover, rendering the ipdC gene inactive significantly decreased the ability of 
the bacterium to stimulate root growth in canola seedlings. Since this initial dem-
onstration of the effectiveness of bacterial IAA in promoting plant growth, sev-
eral other groups of researchers have reported similar results with different PGPB

strains. Interestingly, in several instances, low IAA levels were still detected in 
the culture supernatant of the ipdC mutant. A possible explanation for this obser-
vation is that these low levels of IAA are from alternative IAA pathways co-exist-
ing in these strains.
Azospirillum brasilense is a gram-negative, nitrogen-fixing bacterium. It is 
a rhizosphere inhabitant that associates with the roots of grasses and cereals. 
It promotes plant growth by several different mechanisms including increas-
ing the number of root hairs and lateral roots as a consequence of its synthe-
sis of IAA. This bacterium mainly produces IAA via the IPA pathway so that 
an engineered mutation in the ipdC gene resulted in a mutant producing less 
than 10 % of the IAA produced by the wild-type strain. In another experiment, 
researchers were able to increase IAA production in A. brasilense Sp245 by 
introducing recombinant plasmid-based copies of the ipdC gene under the con-
trol of the constitutive promoter PnptII or the root exudate-responsive promoter 
PsbpA. Both modified strains maintained high cell densities on plant roots one 
month after sowing. More importantly, winter wheat inoculated with the IAA-
overproducing strains displayed enhanced shoot biomass and slightly decreased 
root biomass.

3.1.1.3  The IAN Pathway
IAA may also be synthesized via the indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN)/indole-3-
­acetaldoxime (IAOx) pathway (Fig.  3.7). The first step of this pathway is the 
conversion of tryptophan into indole-3-acetaldoxime. The microbial enzyme 
responsible for this conversion is likely an oxidoreductase. In the second step, the

73
indole-3-acetaldoxime intermediate is converted into indole-3-acetonitrile by an 
indoleacetaldoxime dehydratase. The indole-3-acetonitrile intermediate is conse-
quently converted to IAA by a nitrilase enzyme in a single step, or by a nitrile 
hydratase and an amidase in a two-step process.
Nitrilases are part of a large superfamily of enzymes with over 180 known 
members classified into 13 branches. Branch I enzymes are known to have 
true nitrilase activity, converting nitriles into their corresponding carboxylic 
acids and ammonia. Although this branch of nitrilase enzymes is implicated 
in IAA biosynthesis, there are very few literature reports of bacterial nitrilases  
producing IAA.
3.1.1.4  Multiple Pathways
There is mounting evidence that a number of soil bacteria, both PGPB and phy-
topathogens, contain more than one pathway encoding the biosynthesis of IAA. 
This observation has led to considerable speculation as to why this might be the 
case. On the one hand, soil bacteria that associate with the roots of plants use IAA 
to loosen plant cell walls and increase the extent of root exudation. Thus, when 
rhizosphere bacteria synthesize IAA, they can increase the level of plant nutrients 
to which they have access.
When the genome of the PGPB P. putida UW4 was sequenced and analyzed, 
seven potential IAA biosynthetic genes were identified (Fig. 3.8). Based on DNA 
sequence homology with the IAA biosynthesis genes from other sequenced 
bacteria, these genes were assigned to the IAM and the IAN pathways with the 
two pathways intersecting and overlapping. In fact, a search of other sequenced 
Pseudomonas spp. genomes for a UW4-like IAA pathway revealed the presence 
of six orthologous genes in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and P. putida F1, 
suggesting that these bacterial strains contain similar IAA biosynthesis pathways 
compared to strain UW4. Whether or not these inferred pathways operate as sug-
gested, and how this complex biosynthetic pathway might be regulated remains 
to be elaborated. One way to do this would be to generate mutations in the genes 
involved in this pathway and test their activity, and/or to biochemically character-
ize all of the enzymes encoded by these genes.
3.1.2  Regulation
Given the fact that IAA is produced both by plants and by the microorganisms 
with which the plant associates, it is sometimes difficult to sort out how these two 
sources of IAA interact and affect one another. Here, the regulatory mechanisms 
of bacterial IAA biosynthesis are emphasized.
3.1  Auxin

74
3  Modulating Phytohormone Levels
3.1.2.1  Gene Localization
The amount of IAA produced by a bacterium is subject to several means of reg-
ulation. For example, Whether the IAA biosynthesis genes are located on the 
bacterial chromosome or a plasmid can affect the amount of IAA produced by 
that organism. For example, genes present on multi-copy plasmids will be pre-
sent in more copies than when the gene is present as a single copy in the chro-
mosome. Thus, the phytopathogen Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi has 
Fig. 3.8   Two potential overlapping pathways of IAA biosynthesis inferred from an analysis of 
the sequence of the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. UW4. The two potential IAA biosyn-
thesis pathways are the IAM and IAN pathways. Genes encoding enzymes catalyzing each of the 
steps shown here were identified in the genome of this bacterium. TRP tryptophan; IAOx indole-
3-acetyldoxime; IAN indole-3-acetonitrile; IAM indole-3-acetamide; IAA indole-3-acetic acid

75
plasmid-borne IAA biosynthetic genes and produces more IAA than the phy-
topathogen P. syringae pv. syringae, whose homologous genes are on the chro-
mosome. In addition, different IAA biosynthesis pathways may be more readily 
expressed in certain microenvironments such as on plant surfaces or inside plant 
tissues. Thus, with the phytopathogen, Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae, the 
genes for the IAM pathway, located on the pPATH plasmid are highly transcribed 
inside the plant stems as opposed to on the leaf surfaces.
3.1.2.2  IAA Conjugation
The presence of the iaaL gene within a bacterium’s genome is presumed to regu-
late the amount of free IAA. The amount of free IAA in the pathogen P. savas-
tanoi is dependent upon both the rate of IAA production and conversion of IAA 
to the conjugated form, IAA-lysine (Fig. 3.9). The iaaL gene encoding IAA-lysine 
synthetase is responsible for this conversion and is located near the IAA operon 
on plasmid pIAA1 in this bacterium. An iaaL mutant, constructed via transposon 
mutagenesis, had undetectable IAA-lysine synthetase activity and consequently 
accumulated fivefold more IAA in culture than the wild-type strain. On the other 
hand, olive gall isolates of this bacterium do not convert IAA to IAA-lysine, 
naturally producing approximately twice as much IAA as oleander isolates do. 
However, when the IAA-lysine synthetase gene (iaaL) was introduced into an olive 
gall isolate, IAA-lysine accumulated in culture, reducing IAA levels by 30 %.
3.1.2.3  Stationary Phase Control
In some bacteria, a two-component regulatory system composed of a GacS sen-
sory kinase and a GacA response regulator may be involved in controlling the 
synthesis of IAA. This system has previously been shown to regulate a variety of 
genes involved in the production of bacterial secondary metabolites. For example, 
when E. cloacae CAL2 or Pseudomonas sp. UW4 were genetically transformed 
with a plasmid harboring either RpoS or GacS genes from a strain of P. fluores-
cens, there was a 10- and twofold increase in IAA levels, respectively. Prior to this 
Fig. 3.9   Conversion of IAA to the IAA-lysine conjugate

76
3  Modulating Phytohormone Levels
work, the GacS system was found to up-regulate the synthesis of RpoS, the sta-
tionary phase sigma factor. In nature, bacteria mostly exist in the stationary phase, 
and IAA synthesis has previously been associated with the stationary phase. Thus, 
RpoS and GacS work together in the regulation of IAA synthesis and the observed 
increase in IAA production a direct consequence of RpoS accumulation.
The PGPB, Azotobacter brasilense is typically found in soils with low oxygen 
concentrations so that it is not surprising that the IPA pathway, which is commonly 
used by A. brasilense strains for IAA biosynthesis, is enhanced under anaerobic 
conditions. Under aerobic conditions, IAA production and ipdC gene expression 
are greatly reduced compared to microaerobic conditions, while the bacterial bio-
mass remains relatively unaffected. The available data suggest that carbon limita-
tion and a reduction in bacterial growth rate promote ipdC gene expression, and 
eventually IAA synthesis, in A. brasilense, conditions that are characteristic of the 
stationary phase of growth. In fact, the inability of Azospirillum strains to produce 
IAA in the presence of abundant amounts of carbon may explain the failure of this 
bacterium to promote plant growth in rich or highly fertilized soils.
3.1.2.4  Regulatory Sequences
The promoter region of the ipdC gene of the PGPB strain E. cloacae UW5 con-
tains a sequence (TGTAAA-N6-TTTACA) that is similar to the TyrR recognition 
sequence of E. coli. The tyrR gene encodes a regulatory protein that is both an 
activator and a repressor of genes involved in aromatic amino acid transport and 
metabolism. In fact, an E. cloacae UW5 tyrR insertion mutant, similar to an ipdC 
insertion mutant, did not produce any IAA in the presence of tryptophan in the 
stationary phase. Using real-time qRT-PCR, it was possible to show that ipdC 
transcript levels in the tyrR mutant were very low in the stationary phase even 
in the presence of high levels of added tryptophan. These results indicate that, in 
this PGPB strain, both the TyrR recognition sequence and an intact ipdC gene are 
required for IAA production.
The DNA sequence of the 5′ upstream region of the ipdC gene of A. brasilense 
strains SM, Sp45, and Sp7 has been found to be similar to the auxin responsive 
elements that have been found in plants. This promoter region extends to position 
−81 relative to the ipdC transcription initiation site. Within this upstream region, 
located between positions −2 and −23 is the plant-like TGTCNC element, which 
is essential for ipdC expression. In addition, between positions −58 and −38, 
there are two 8-bp inverted repeats separated by a 4-bp spacer that is also required 
for full activation of the ipdC promoter and for its IAA inducibility.
In A. brasilense, there is also an open reading frame 99-bp downstream of the 
ipdC gene that is co-transcribed in an operon with ipdC and appears to reduce 
IAA production. This open reading frame is known as iaaC. Moreover, a puta-
tive mRNA stem-loop structure that may function as a transcription terminator was 
found in the region downstream of iaaC. With an iaaC insertion mutant, there was 
no difference in ipdC expression compared to the wild-type strain; however, the 

77
IAA levels in the iaaC insertion mutant were dramatically increased (up to six-
fold) when measured at the stationary growth phase. These findings suggest that 
the protein encoded by iaaC acts as an inhibitor/regulator of IAA production 
(Fig. 3.10).
3.1.3  Effects on PGPB Survival
In addition to directly affecting plant gene expression, bacterial IAA has been 
found to have some important modulating effects on the metabolism of some 
PGPB. In one set of experiments, Sinorhizobium meliloti was either treated with 
a high level of IAA or else it was genetically modified, by introducing an exog-
enous IAM pathway (from a PGPB), to overexpress IAA. In S. meliloti, IAA 
biosynthesis typically occurs through the IPA pathway. In both cases, the activ-
ity of some key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes and the level of acetyl-
CoA were all increased compared to the wild-type untreated strain (Fig.  3.11). 
Moreover, the levels of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the carbon stor-
age compound polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is generally metabolized when 
other common energy sources are not available, were also increased. The results 
of these experiments were confirmed by a transcriptomic analysis using a micro-
array of S. meliloti genes. In addition, following a month long survival experi-
ment, the presence of an increased amount of IAA resulted in more S. meliloti 
cells surviving. Based on these results, it was speculated that the increased level 
of PHB might provide carbon and energy sources to S. meliloti that facilitated its 
conversion from a free-living bacterium into differentiated bacteroids. In addi-
tion, it is thought that the increase in the long-term survival of the bacterium 
might be a consequence of the presence of a higher level of PHB in the bacte-
rium. Besides increasing bacterial long-term survival, increased IAA has been 
found to upregulate genes coding for the high-affinity P transport system, induce 
acid phosphatase activity, and the increase secretion into the growth medium of

malate, succinate, and fumarate. Since organic acids such as malate, succinate, 
and fumarate are well known for their ability to solubilize inorganic phosphate, 
the IAA-stimulated increased flux through the TCA cycle appears to be directly 
responsible for this effect (Fig.  3.11). More recently, researchers modified the 
rolA promoter from Agrobacterium rhizogenes and used the modified promoter to 
drive the transcription of iaaM and tms2 genes (encoding IAA biosynthesis). They 
found that increasing the IAA concentration in S. meliloti resulted in a signifi-
cant increase in the shoot fresh weight of alfalfa plants nodulated by the modified  
S. meliloti, compared to plants nodulated by the wild-type strain. This work may 
be important from a practical perspective as it suggests the approach of mutagen-
izing endogenous rhizobial promoters without introducing foreign DNA. That is, 
it should be possible to specifically mutagenize promoters of rhizobial (or other 
PGPB) IAA biosynthesis genes and thereby increase bacterial production of IAA. 
If these constructed mutants increased their promotion of plant growth compared 
to the wild-type strains, according to EU rules, they could be deliberately released 
to the environment and would not be considered to be genetically engineered

strains (see Chap. 8). Finally, whether the effects observed here reflect a phenom-
enon common to many different PGPB, or are specific to S. meliloti remains to be 
determined.
3.2  Cytokinin
Cytokinins are a class of compounds that promote cell division and some similar 
functions and have a structure that resembles adenine. Kinetin (Fig. 3.12a) was the 
first cytokinin to be discovered (in 1955) and was so named because of the com-
pound’s ability to promote cytokinesis or cell division. Today, kinetin is usually 
considered to be a “synthetic” cytokinin because it is not synthesized in plants per 
se; it was originally found in yeast extract. The most common form of cytokinin in 
plants is zeatin (Fig. 3.12b) which was originally isolated from corn (Zea mays). 
Plant cytokinins are synthesized primarily within roots although the hormone is 
found distributed throughout the plant.
Cytokinins affect a range of different plant cells. They have been shown to 
modulate cell division, seed germination, apical dominance, root elongation, 
xylem and chloroplast differentiation, transition to reproductive growth phase, 
flower and fruit development, leaf senescence, nutritional signaling, and plant–
pathogen interactions. The wide variety of effects observed suggests that cyto-
kinins might have different mechanisms in different plant tissues. Cytokinins can 
stimulate cell division/growth, and consequently, they simultaneously inhibit plant 
aging/senescence. Under natural conditions, a higher ratio of cytokinin to auxin 
favors shoot, over root, and formation.
Cytokinins have been detected in the cell-free medium of some PGPB strains 
including: Azotobacter spp., Rhizobium spp., P. agglomerans, Rhodospirillum 
rubrum, P. fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. In addi-
tion, cytokinin biosynthesis genes have been detected in various phytopathogens 
including A. tumefaciens (outside of the T-DNA which is actually plant-derived 
DNA), P. savastanoi, E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, and Streptomyces turgidis-
cabies, as well as in some PGPB. Thus, as with IAA, some, but not all, PGPB 
strains (and some strains of phytopathogens) synthesize cytokinins. Based on 
limited data, it is thought that PGPB probably produce lower cytokinin levels 
compared to phytopathogens so that the effect of the PGPB on plant growth is

generally stimulatory while the effect of the pathogens is “overstimulatory” (i.e., 
tumor-inducing).
It has been shown, in transgenic plants that overexpress cytokinin, especially 
in response to certain stresses like drought or the presence of high levels of salt, 
that high levels of cytokinin can significantly delay the plant senescence that often 
occurs as a direct consequence of the stress. Thus, under the right conditions, salt- 
or drought-stressed transgenic plants that overexpress cytokinin will remain green 
and healthy while non-transformed plants are completely wilted under the same 
conditions. In addition, there are reports that adding cytokinins to some plants can 
increase the level of resistance against the phytopathogen P. syringae pv. tabaci.
A number of PGPB have been shown to both possess and express cytokinin 
genes, and in some instances, it has been shown that the addition of PGPB that 
secretes cytokinins to growing plants can significantly alter the plant’s composi-
tion of several other phytohormones. Unfortunately, notwithstanding these obser-
vations, researchers have not as yet demonstrated that bacterial cytokinin may 
be as useful to plants as was demonstrated with the expression of foreign cyto-
kinin genes in transgenic plants. To do this will require the isolation and testing of 
mutants of PGPB in which the wild-type strain but not the (non-producing) mutant 
strain promotes specific aspects of plant growth and development. An important 
first step in this regard is the development of a simple and reproducible means 
of assaying bacterial strains for the ability to synthesize cytokinins. Of course, 
cytokinin concentrations may readily be assayed by HPLC. However, despite the 
availability of this equipment in many labs, it is not always available in develop-
ing countries and is not readily amenable in assaying very large numbers of bio-
logical samples. As an alternative, some workers have developed a rather simple 
biological assay that might be useful in this endeavor (Fig. 3.13). Notwithstanding 
its simplicity, this non-quantitative assay is able to detect cytokinin concentrations

assay, cucumber cotyledons are excised from etiolated plants and placed on an agar plate ~2 mm 
from a PGPB culture that may synthesize cytokinin. Following a 20-h incubation in the dark, 
the plates are exposed to light for 3 h; as a result, the cotyledons that are exposed to cytokinin 
secreted by the PGPB cells turn a dark green color

as low as 10−7 M. Thus, in the future, it should be possible for researchers to use 
this assay to both screen large numbers of bacteria for the presence of cytokinin 
minus mutants and, subsequently, to complement those mutants with clones that 
encode the biosynthesis of active cytokinin. As well, with either this assay or by 
using HPLC, it should also be possible to select naturally occurring bacterial cyto-
kinin overproducers. This is important because if the benefits of high levels of 
exogenous cytokinin are to be realized by treated plants, this can only occur if the 
cytokinin is added as a foreign chemical or as part of a naturally occurring PGPB. 
This is because, both at the present time and in the foreseeable future, the wide-
spread use of genetically engineered PGPB strains is not acceptable to the regula-
tory authorities in most jurisdictions.
3.3  Gibberelin
Gibberellins are a large family of closely related ent-kaurene-derived diterpenoid 
phytohormones (Fig. 3.14). Gibberellic acid (GA3) is synthesized by some PGPB 
(Table 3.3) and is produced commercially by fermentation of the fungus Giberella 
fujikuroi. Despite the fact that there are large number of different gibberellins, 
the biological activity and role of molecules other than GA3 remain unresolved. 
Since its discovery, scientists have ascertained that gibberellins are involved 
in increasing plant stem growth, germination dormancy, flowering, and leaf and 
fruit senescence. More recently, it has been shown that GA primarily affects shoot 
growth; however, root growth is also regulated by GA, but in a lower concentra-
tion range than is required for shoot growth (Fig. 3.15). Thus, it is generally rec-
ognized that GA plays an indispensable role in both shoot and root development 
in many plants. The concentration effect observed with gibberellin is very similar 
to what has been observed for IAA. Finally, despite the fact that a number of dif-
ferent gibberellin-producing PGPB have been identified, PGPB are not generally 
selected, or even tested, for gibberellin synthesis, and no gibberellin-producing 
PGPB strains have been commercialized. Most of what is currently believed to be 
the role of bacterially produced gibberellins (and cytokinins as well) is based on 
the response of plants to the exogenous addition of purified gibberellins (or cyto-
kinins) to growing plants. At present, while the gibberellin biosynthetic pathways 
in plants and fungi are known, much less is known regarding how bacteria produce 
gibberelins. Plants generally utilize two diterpene synthases to form ent-kaurene,

while fungi use only a single bifunctional diterpene synthase. However, relatively 
recently, it was found that some strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum encode 
two sequentially acting diterpene cyclases, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, 
and ent-kaurene synthase. Together, these two enzymes transform geranylgeranyl

encoding these two genes is selectively expressed during nodulation. Moreover, 
the operon encoding these genes has been found in several additional species of 
Rhizobia suggesting that gibberellin biosynthesis may be common in Rhizobia.
3.4  Ethylene
Ethylene is one of the simplest molecules with biological activity. In the Hebrew 
Bible, the prophet Amos is described as a “herdsman and a nipper of figs.” This 
indicates that as early as the ninth century B.C.E., it was recognized that nipping 
(or scoring or piercing) figs that were picked when they were still unripe produced 
ethylene gas thereby hastening the ripening process and making the figs sweeter. 
Despite this very early observation of the consequences of ethylene action, it was 
not until the late nineteenth century that ethylene was first recognized (by Dimitri 
Neljubov) as an active plant hormone.
Ethylene displays a wide range of biological activities and may be active at 
concentrations as low as 0.05 μL/L; however, in ripening fruit, ethylene concen-
trations may reach levels as high as 200  μL/L. Ethylene, which is produced in 
almost all plants, mediates a range of plant responses and developmental steps. 
Ethylene is involved in seed germination, tissue differentiation, formation of root 
and shoot primordia, root branching and elongation, lateral bud development, 
flowering initiation, anthocyanin synthesis, flower opening and senescence, fruit 
ripening and degreening, production of volatile organic compounds responsible 
for aroma formation in fruits, storage product hydrolysis, leaf senescence, leaf and 
fruit abscission, Rhizobia nodule formation, mycorrhizae-plant interaction, and 
(importantly) the response of plants to various biotic and abiotic stress. In some 
instances, ethylene is stimulatory while in others, it is inhibitory.
3.4.1  Ethylene Biosynthesis and Mode of Action
In plants, the biosynthesis of ethylene begins with the compound S-adenosyl­
methionine (SAM), a compound that is also a precursor of several other pathways 
and is, therefore, abundant within plant tissues (Fig. 3.16). For the synthesis of 
ethylene, first the enzyme ACC synthase converts SAM to 1-aminocyclopro-
pane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). The MTA is 
recycled to L-methionine (the immediate precursor of SAM) enabling the level 
of L-methionine to remain relatively unchanged even during fairly high rates of 
ethylene production. Researchers have suggested that this is the committal step 
in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, since the extremely labile ACC synthase 
enzyme may be rate limiting and also rises proportionally with the increase in eth-
ylene levels within the tissues of some plants. The gene for this enzyme is part 
3.3  Gibberelin

84
3  Modulating Phytohormone Levels
of a multi-gene family, and considerable evidence indicates that the transcrip-
tion of different forms is induced under different environmental or physiological 
conditions.
The next step is the conversion of ACC to ethylene by ACC oxidase, which is 
typically present in most plant tissues at very low levels. Like ACC synthase, ACC 
oxidase genes are also part of a multi-gene family and different isoforms of ACC 
oxidase appear to be active under different physiological conditions. Other than in 
ripening fruit, both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase are inducible enzymes.
The conjugation of ACC with malonate or glutathione is thought to occur via 
the action of the enzymes ACC N-malonyl transferase and γ-glutamyl transpepti-
dase, with the production of 1-(malonyl)-ACC (MACC) and 1-(glutamyl)-ACC 
(GACC), respectively. The Km of ACC N-malonyl transferase for ACC is much 
higher than the Km of ACC oxidase for ACC so that if the two enzymes a present 
in similar amounts, the ACC will bind preferentially to ACC oxidase and be con-
verted into ethylene. The conjugation reactions create a sink for ACC only when it 
is present in high levels (i.e., there is more ACC than is needed for ethylene syn-
thesis), or when ACC oxidase is saturated or absent.
Ethylene perception occurs through a chain of events that are conserved among 
plants. The ethylene receptor proteins bind ethylene with the help of a copper 
cofactor that is bound in the transmembrane domain. In the absence of ethylene,

the receptor activates a downstream kinase called CTR1 that, through several 
additional steps, inhibits ethylene responsive gene expression. When it is bound 
to ethylene the receptor, the complex undergoes a conformational change caus-
ing the receptor to be “inhibited” as is the CTR1 kinase. This causes the inacti-
vation of the negative signaling events, thus permitting the ethylene response. 
Thus, the kinase cascade serves as a negative regulator of ethylene responsive gene 
expression.
3.4.2  ACC Deaminase
The enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase is capa-
ble of degrading the ethylene precursor, ACC, to ammonia and α-ketobutyrate 
(Fig. 3.17). Since its initial discovery in 1978, this enzyme has been reported to 
be widespread in soil bacteria and to also be present in some fungi. Moreover, 
the functioning of this enzyme has been implicated as one of the key mechanisms 
employed by PGPB to facilitate plant growth. Simply put, by breaking down some 
of the ACC in plants, this enzyme can lower plant ethylene levels thereby decreas-
ing the extent of ethylene inhibition on plant growth, especially following various 
biotic and abiotic stress.
The model that was developed to explain the ability of ACC deaminase-­
containing PGPB to facilitate plant growth may be described as follows 
(Fig. 3.18). At the outset, PGPB must efficiently colonize either plant roots (either 
internally or externally) or seeds. If the bound bacteria synthesize and secrete 
IAA, that IAA is taken up by the plant, and together with the IAA synthesized 
by the plant itself, it can either stimulate plant growth (cell proliferation and/or 
elongation) or induce the transcription of the gene encoding the plant enzyme 
ACC synthase, which converts SAM to ACC. The IAA is also involved in plant 
root cell wall loosening thereby increasing plant root exudation. Along with other 
small molecules, a portion of the plant’s ACC, both preexisting and newly formed 
by the above-mentioned increase in the amount of ACC synthase, is exuded from 
germinating seeds or from plant roots. The exuded ACC is taken up by the bacte-
ria, and subsequently converted by the enzyme ACC deaminase to ammonia and 
α-ketobutyrate. As a result of this activity, the level of ACC within plant tissues 
and hence the amount of ethylene produced by the plant is lowered and does not 
reach levels that are inhibitory for plant growth. The main short-term visible effect 
of seed inoculation with ACC deaminase-producing bacteria, under gnotobiotic

conditions, and therefore a simple and reliable biological assay for this enzyme, 
is the enhancement of plant seedling root length. For example, when the amount 
of canola root ACC and the root length were assessed following treatment of 
seeds with an ACC deaminase-containing PGPB or a chemical inhibitor of ethyl-
ene synthesis (AVG), both treatments lowered the amount of ACC in the roots and 
increased the root length of the seedlings, with the bacterial treatment being more 
effective than the chemical treatment (Fig. 3.19). In addition, when an ACC deam-
inase minus mutant was substituted for the wild-type bacterium, the ACC content 
was not lowered and the root length was not increased. Thus, the observed effects 
are a direct consequence of the enzyme ACC deaminase. Importantly, the growth 
promotion effects that are seen in short-term canola growth pouch assays persist 
throughout the life of the plant and are readily visible in soil (Fig. 3.15).
One problem with the above-mentioned model is that the enzyme ACC oxi-
dase has ~100 times greater affinity for ACC than does ACC deaminase. If the 
two enzymes were present in comparable amounts, nearly all of the ACC would 
be bound by the ACC oxidase and then converted into ethylene. Thus, for ACC 
deaminase to be effective at lowering plant ethylene, it must be present prior to

the induction of ACC oxidase so that it remains in a 100- to a 1,000-fold molar 
excess over ACC oxidase. The net result of the cleavage of exuded ACC by bacte-
rial ACC deaminase is that the bacterium is de facto acting as a sink for ACC with 
the amount of ACC within the plant tissues decreasing. The amount of ACC that is 
present within plant tissues can be determined by (1) chemically derivatizing the 
ACC and then (2) separating and quantifying it by HPLC.
The enzyme ACC deaminase has been biochemically characterized in several 
studies. These studies have indicated that the enzyme (1) is found in both bacteria and 
fungi; (2) requires pyridoxal phosphate as a co-factor; (3) has a monomeric molec-
ular mass of approximately 35–45  kD; (4) is a multimeric enzyme (with a native 
size estimated to be 100–115 kD) that has been suggested to be either a dimer or a 
trimer; (5) binds the substrate, ACC, only poorly with a Km typically in the range of 
~1.5–6 mM; (6) has only very limited activity with substrates other than ACC; (7) is 
a sulfhydryl enzyme; (8) is cytoplasmically localized; and (9) although a low level of 
the enzyme is constitutively synthesized, is induced by low levels of ACC (~100 nM).
3.4.2.1  Transcriptional Regulation
ACC deaminase activity is transcriptionally regulated in a similar manner in a num-
ber of different free-living soil bacteria as well as Rhizobia. In the model shown, 
the acdR (ACC deaminase regulatory) gene encodes the LRP (leucine-rich regula-
tory) protein and acdS is the ACC deaminase structural gene (Fig. 3.20). The active 
form of the LRP protein is an octamer that can, when it present in excess, bind to 
the LRP box on the DNA preventing additional transcription of the gene encoding 
this protein. Alternatively, this octamer can bind to the AcdB protein (shown as a

blue star) which is complexed with ACC, and as a result, in the presence of oxygen 
and a CRP (cAMP receptor) protein, bind to the CRP box and activate transcrip-
tion from the acdS promoter. In the absence of oxygen, the octamer-AcdB-ACC 
complex binds to the FNR (fumarate-nitrate reductase) protein before the entire 
complex binds to the FNR box, also activating an acdS promoter. In addition to 
all of the above-mentioned proteins, the bacterial RNA polymerase is also required 
for transcription of acdR and acdS. Following its synthesis, AcdS (i.e., ACC 
deaminase) degrades ACC, producing ammonia and α-ketobutyrate. When ACC is 
degraded, the α-ketobutyrate is converted into branched chain amino acids includ-
ing leucine. Finally, an excess of free leucine causes the LRP octamer to dissociate 
into an inactive dimeric form. Notwithstanding the fact that ACC deaminase is not 
needed for the survival of the bacteria in which it is encoded, this rather complex 
mode of gene expression suggests that the expression of this gene is highly impor-
tant to the environmental functioning of some bacteria.
In some bacteria, the FNR and CRP proteins and boxes are not part of the 
regulatory mechanism of ACC deaminase gene expression. It is likely that these 
genetic elements facilitate protein expression with bacteria that are commonly 
found at the aerobic–anaerobic interphase within the soil. Bacteria that are found 
primarily at one or the other environment may not require this part of the regula-
tory mechanism. Moreover, as indicated below, Mesorhizobium species transcrip-
tionally regulate ACC deaminase gene expression in an entirely different manner.
3.4.3  Ethylene and Nodulation
Bacteria that contain ACC deaminase activity are found relatively commonly in 
a wide range of soils. Genes coding for ACC deaminase have been found in gram-
negative and gram-positive bacteria, rhizobia, methylobacteria, rhizosphere bacteria 
Fig.  3.20   A model of the transcriptional regulation of ACC deaminase in some free-living 
­bacteria and Rhizobia spp

and endophytes, and fungi. In one study, 12 % of the Rhizobium spp. isolated from 
nodules of wild legumes at a number of different sites in southern and central 
Saskatchewan, Canada (over an area of approximately 40,000  km2), encoded and 
expressed this enzyme. In another study, ACC deaminase activity/genes were found in 
a wide range of different bacteria including Azospirillum, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, 
Achromobacter, Burkholderia, Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter.
In many instances, the identification of an ACC deaminase gene in a particular 
organism is based on DNA sequence similarity to known ACC deaminase genes. 
However, sequence homology by itself does not suffice to define an open reading 
frame as an ACC deaminase encoding sequence. This is because several other pyr-
idoxal phosphate enzymes have sequences that are similar to ACC deaminase. For 
instance, in one study, based on enzyme activity, changing only two amino acids 
was sufficient to change a D-cysteine desulfhydratase gene to ACC deaminase and 
an ACC deaminase to D-cysteine desulfhydratase.
Ethylene is an inhibitor of rhizobial nodulation of legumes, and since the 
infection of plant roots by Rhizobia causes plants to locally produce ethylene, 
rhizobial infection is a self-limiting process. On the other hand, many strains of 
Rhizobia produce either rhizobitoxine (Fig. 3.21), a naturally occurring chemical 
inhibitor of the enzyme ACC synthase (produced and secreted by some strains of 
Bradyrhizobium elkanii), or ACC deaminase, which allows these strains to locally 
lower the root ethylene levels (caused by rhizobial infection) and thereby increas-
ing both nodulation and plant biomass, typically by ~30 % (Fig. 3.22). When dif-
ferent strains of Rhizobium spp. were assayed for the presence of ACC deaminase, 
it was found that some, but not all, strains contained this enzyme (Table  3.4). 
These strains were assayed for ACC deaminase in three different ways: enzyme 
activity, Southern hybridization (in case there was no enzyme activity but the gene 
for this enzyme was present), and Western blotting (in case there was no enzyme 
activity but the enzyme protein was synthesized). A few years after these experi-
ments were reported, it was demonstrated that the ACC deaminase genes in a num-
ber of Mesorhizobium strains were transcriptionally regulated under the control of 
the nifA promoter. Recall that the nifA gene positively regulates the expression of 
other nif genes and in Rhizobia spp. is expressed exclusively inside nodules. Thus, 
the transcriptional regulation of Mesorhizobium ACC deaminase genes appears to 
be different from the more common mode of regulation described above. Some 
researchers have suggested that the expression of ACC deaminase genes within 
nitrogen-fixing nodules decreases the rate of nodule senescence—as nitrogen fix-
ation with its high energy demand could activate stress ethylene synthesis—and 
by prolonging the lifetime of the nodule, effectively increases the amount of fixed

nitrogen. Interestingly, a large number of commercial strains, but a much smaller 
number of field strains, have ACC deaminase activity. This suggests that the future 
screening of field isolates of Rhizobia for ACC deaminase activity may be one 
means of rapidly selecting strains with superior commercial inoculant potential.
In one series of experiments, researchers noted that Rhizobium sp. TAL1145 
has an ACC deaminase gene that is regulated by nifA and is not induced by ACC 
but rather by mimosine. The alkaloid mimosine is β-3-hydroxy-4 pyridone amino 
acid (Fig. 3.23). This (otherwise) toxic compound occurs in several Mimosa and 
Leucaena spp. Similar to what has been suggested with Mesorhizobium spp., this 
ACC deaminase gene is thought to decrease the rate of nodule senescence. This 
bacterium was subsequently genetically transformed with an ACC deaminase gene 
from Sinorhizobium sp. BL3 which, like most other rhizobial ACC deaminase 
genes, is transcriptionally regulated by acdR and induced by ACC. In response to 
the introduction of the foreign acdS gene, when the transformed strain was used 
in association with Leucaena leucocephala plants, a small species of Mimosoid 
tree native to Mexico and Central America, both nodule number and size as well 
as root biomass, were significantly increased. In this instance, with two different 
acdS genes, each transcriptionally regulated by a different mechanism, the trans-
formants caused the formation of more and larger nodules that were more long 
lived than usual. Unfortunately, at this time, regulatory agencies are unlikely to 
readily approve the field use of such a genetically manipulated bacterium.
Despite a similar mode of expression, most Rhizobia spp. usually express a low 
percentage of ACC deaminase enzyme activity (typically about 3–10  %), com-
pared to the amount expressed by free-living plant growth-promoting bacteria. The 
free-living bacteria that bind relatively non-specifically to plant roots, with a high 
level of ACC deaminase activity, protect plants from a range of different stresses

by lowering ethylene levels throughout the plant (see Chaps. 5–7). On the other 
hand, Rhizobia spp. bind tightly only to the roots of specific plants and have a low 
level of enzyme activity which facilitates nodulation by locally lowering ethylene 
levels without affecting the overall ethylene concentration in the plant.
3.5  Volatile Organic Compounds
Studies with some gram-positive bacteria (including B. subtilis and B. amylolique-
faciens) and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana indicate that some PGPB pro-
duce and subsequently release volatile compounds that are able to stimulate 
plant growth. To detect this mode of plant growth promotion, 6–10 germinated

surface-sterilized A. thaliana seeds were planted on one side of an agar petri plate 
and 20 μL of a bacterial inoculant was spotted in the middle of the other half of 
the plate. In addition, the two halves of the agar plate were physically separated 
by a center partition. Following an incubation period of 14 days, the leaf surface 
area of the plants on each plate was measured (Fig. 3.24). Based on this assay, 
it was found that two of the PGPB strains (B. subtilis GB03 and B. amylolique-
faciens IN937a) significantly increased the plant leaf surface area. The volatile 
compounds produced by these bacteria were analyzed by gas chromatography, and 
it was subsequently determined that two compounds acetoin and 2,3 butanediol 
(Fig. 3.25) were responsible for the bulk of the observed increase in leaf surface 
area. Moreover, in this system, PGPB mutants unable to synthesize these two 
compounds do not promote plant growth. It should, however, be noted that other 
(so-called minor) volatile compounds that are produced by these bacteria may 
also play a role in signaling the plant to alter its gene expression and thereby its 
physiology.
The above-mentioned experiment was repeated with mutant strains of A. thali-
ana that were altered in their response to one or more plant hormones. The results 
of these experiments suggested that volatile compound plant growth promotion did 
not depend at all on brassinosteroids, gibberellin, or ethylene signaling. However, 
on the basis of these experiments, the participation of auxin cannot be excluded. 
In a more definitive experiment, A. thaliana plants treated with volatile organic

compounds were subjected to microarray analysis at 48 and 72 h after treatment. 
At both times, the expression of genes encoding flavonoid and auxin synthesis, 
and cell wall-loosening enzymes were increased. Also, ribosomal protein synthe-
sis was increased at 72 h indicating elevated protein synthesis. In addition, vola-
tile organic compound-mediated growth promotion is inhibited by blocking auxin 
transport with the result that gene expression for auxin synthesis is up-regulated 
in the aerial regions of GB03-exposed plants. That is, following treatment with 
volatile organic compounds, auxin accumulation decreases in leaves and increases 
in roots. All of this data are consistent with the notion that volatile organic com-
pounds regulate auxin homeostasis in plants thereby promoting plant growth.
Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to B. subtilis GB03 or B. amyloliquefaciens IN937a 
for four days developed significantly fewer symptomatic leaves 24 h after inoculation 
with the soft rot-causing pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. This effect 
was attributed to the development of induced systemic resistance or ISR (discussed 
in Chap. 5) in the more resistant plants. It was further deduced that the volatiles from 
strain IN937a triggered ISR through an ethylene-independent signaling pathway, 
whereas volatiles from strain GB03 operate through an ethylene-dependent pathway.
In a different type of experiment, volatile organic compounds released by three 
different PGPB (P. fluorescens, B. subtilis, and A. brasilense) were found to stimu-
late the growth parameters and the composition of essential oils in the aromatic 
plant Mentha piperita (peppermint). As in the experiments described above, the 
bacteria and plants were grown on the same petri plate, but were separated by a 
physical barrier so that the plants were exposed only to the volatile organic com-
pounds but not to solutes from the bacteria. Based on the observation that each 
of the three strains affects the plants somewhat differently, these findings suggest 
that volatile organic compounds can both induce the biosynthesis of secondary 
­metabolites and modulate specific steps of monoterpene metabolism.

With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the early 1970s and the sub-
sequent development of a host of other technologies including DNA sequencing, 
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA synthesis, it is possible to isolate, 
characterize, amplify, and sequence virtually any gene of interest. Moreover, the 
more recently developed techniques of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabo-
lomics may be employed to understand in considerable detail changes in plants 
that occur as a consequence of an interaction with PGPB as well as changes in 
PGPB that result from interactions with plants. The use of these newer techniques 
is enabling researchers to develop more profound understanding of the detailed 
nature of plant–bacterial interactions, an important step in the development of new 
and more efficacious PGPB strains. Here, as a starting point, a number of those 
techniques are examined and discussed.
4.1  Next-Generation DNA Sequencing
The function of a gene may often be deduced from its nucleotide sequence. For 
example, the amino acid sequence of a protein, determined from the nucleotide 
sequence of the DNA that encodes that protein, can be compared with amino acid 
sequences of known proteins, and significant sequence similarity generally indi-
cates a protein with an equivalent function. In addition, distinctive regions of 
chromosomal DNA such as promoters and other regulatory regions can be deter-
mined. Nucleotide sequence information may also facilitate gene isolation and 
characterization.
For several decades, the procedures originally developed (separately) by Fred 
Sanger and Walter Gilbert have been used for DNA sequencing. Sanger and 
Gilbert shared the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Notwithstanding the enormous

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
advances brought about by this work, with time, it became clear that to determine 
the DNA sequence of entire genomes, from bacteria to humans, these approaches 
were much too slow and expensive.
A variety of DNA sequencing techniques are currently being utilized. 
Generally, these methods involve repeated cycles of enzymatic addition of nucle-
otides to a primer based on complementarity to a template DNA fragment and 
detection and identification of the nucleotide(s) added. The techniques differ in the 
method by which the nucleotides are extended, employing either DNA polymerase 
to catalyze the addition of a single nucleotide or DNA ligase to add a short, com-
plementary oligonucleotide, and in the method by which the addition is detected.
4.1.1  Dideoxynucleotide DNA Sequencing
The procedure that was developed by Gilbert is not at all amenable to automation 
and has not been used to any significant extent for some time. In addition, over the 
years, the Sanger procedure has been modified significantly so that it now uses 
nucleotides labeled with fluorescent dyes that are detected using a laser. Starting 
with single-stranded DNA, automated sequence analysis can be carried out as fol-
lows. The sequence of a DNA strand, typically several hundred nucleotides long, 
is copied by incubating the target DNA strand with the enzyme DNA polymer-
ase and the four nucleotide triphosphates that are the building blocks of the DNA 
chain. In addition, dideoxynucleotides present in the reaction mixture are added 
to the growing DNA chain, and when it is encountered, prevent the DNA chain 
from being polymerized any further. A dideoxynucleotide is a synthetic molecule 
that lacks a hydroxyl group at both the 2′ and 3′ carbons of the sugar moiety. One 
way to automate this process is to label each of the four dideoxynucleotides with 
different colored fluorescent dyes, one for each dideoxynucleotide reaction. With 
this system, at the completion of each reaction, the samples are pooled, and the 
fragments are separated in a single lane of a polyacrylamide gel or using a pol-
ymer-filled capillary tube. This type of analysis is called “four-color, one-lane” 
detection. Each fluorescent dye that is struck by the laser beam emits a narrow 
spectrum of light with a distinctive peak. The emission data are recorded and 
stored in a computer. After a run is completed, the succession of fluorescent sig-
nals is converted to nucleotide sequence information. Each fluorescent dye emits 
light of a different wavelength, and the order of spectral responses in a single lane 
corresponds to the sequence of nucleotides (Fig. 4.1). In other words, each dye 
represents a particular nucleotide. With this system, it is possible to read with a 
high degree of accuracy about 500–700 nucleotides per run. Moreover, depend-
ing upon which instrument is used, 96–384 samples can be run at the same time. 
Automated capillary DNA sequencing machines typically handle larger num-
bers of samples with faster separation times than do units that utilize polyacryla-
mide gels. Within a few hours, some instruments can resolve the DNA sequence 
of as much as 100,000 nucleotides. Using several automated instruments (at the 

99
same time) that employ this technique permits researchers to determine the DNA 
sequence of an entire bacterium within a few days time.
4.1.2  Primer Walking
The entire sequence of pieces of DNA longer than about 500–700 bp cannot be 
obtained in a single run in most sequencing systems. In one strategy commonly 
used to get around this problem and thereby sequence larger DNA fragments, the 
dideoxynucleotide sequencing reactions are carried out to determine the identity 
and order of the first 500–700 nucleotides of the DNA. On the basis of this knowl-
edge, a second primer that is designed to hybridize to a region about 20 or so 
nucleotides upstream from the end of the acquired sequence is chemically synthe-
sized and then used as a primer of DNA synthesis to determine the sequence of the 
next 500 or so nucleotides (Fig. 4.2). Similarly, a third and fourth (and, if needed, 
a fifth and sixth) primer-binding site is selected, additional oligonucleotides are 
synthesized, and, in each case, the sequence of the next 500–700 nucleotides is 
determined. This strategy is called “primer walking,” and it can proceed until

copied from the template strand (a) are synthesized and then terminated at various nucleotides by 
fluorescent-labeled dideoxynucleotides (b). The synthesized fragments are separated by size by 
gel or capillary electrophoresis. Each successive fragment contains a different labeled nucleotide 
that represents a nucleotide complementary to the template. The different sized electrophoreti-
cally separated fragments are visualized by a laser interacting with the fluorescent-labeled nucle-
otides (c). The DNA sequence is read from the colors produced by the interaction of the laser 
with the fluorescent-labeled nucleotides

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
the sequence of the entire cloned DNA is determined. To ensure that the overall 
sequence is correct, both strands of the cloned DNA are generally sequenced. To 
avoid the problem of false priming where a primer binds to an incorrect site, prim-
ers used for this procedure are generally at least 24 nucleotides long. In addition, 
stringent annealing conditions (i.e., tight binding of the primer to the template 
DNA) do not permit spurious binding of the primer to similar but nonidentical 
sequences. The technique of primer walking has been used to sequence pieces of 
DNA that are up to 40 kb in length.
4.1.3  Pyrosequencing
The technique of pyrosequencing was the first of the next-generation sequencing 
technologies to become commercially available. This technique is now quite wide-
spread and has contributed to the enormous output of DNA sequence data by the 
scientific community (Fig. 4.3). The basis of this procedure is the detection of the 
pyrophosphate that is released during DNA synthesis. The detection of pyrophos-
phate during DNA synthesis (i.e., the removal of the β- and γ-phosphates) forms 
the basis for determining the DNA sequence of a template strand. Specifically, the 
release of pyrophosphate is correlated with the incorporation of a known nucleo-
tide in the growing DNA strand.
A DNA fragment of unknown sequence (the template) is engineered at one end 
with a sequence that is complementary to a primer, and then, after the primer is 
added, one deoxynucleotide is introduced at a time in the presence of DNA pol-
ymerase. Pyrophosphate is formed only when the complementary nucleotide is

to “walk down” the entire sequence of the cloned DNA

incorporated at the end of the growing strand. The method for detecting pyroph-
osphate is based on a series of coupled enzymatic reactions, the last step of which 
is the generation of light by the enzyme luciferase. The amount of light gener-
ated after the addition of a particular nucleotide is approximately proportional to 
the number of nucleotides that are incorporated into the growing strand. While 
the incorporation of a single nucleotide produces a certain amount of light, 
the incorporation of two or more of the same nucleotides (e.g., the dinucleotide 
sequences AA, TT, CC, or GG) generates a more intense light signal (that is, two

nine A; cytosine C; guanine G; or thymine T; the sugar deoxyribose; and the phosphate groups 
(shown in blue) designated as α, β, and γ (with the α phosphate being the one closest to the sugar 
moiety) (a). During DNA synthesis, the α-phosphate of each incoming complementary nucleo-
tide is joined by a phosphodiester linkage to the 3′ hydroxyl group of the last nucleotide of the 
growing chain. As part of this process, the β- and γ-phosphates are cleaved off as a unit that 
is called pyrophosphate, hence the term pyrosequencing. Bar graph of light emissions following 
pyrophosphate detection where the y-axis indicates whether the incorporation is equivalent to one 
or more nucleotide units and the x-axis presents the sequence of the strand that is complemen-

or more times the intensity of the single nucleotide signal). This linear relation-
ship between light intensity and the number of identical nucleotides holds only for 
stretches of about eight identical nucleotides in a row. Throughout the process, the 
intensity of the light signal is measured and recorded. Ultimately, the light emis-
sions are represented as a bar on a graph where the y-axis indicates whether the 
incorporation is equivalent to one or more nucleotide units and the x-axis presents 
the sequence of the strand that is complementary to the template sequence.
4.1.4  Sequencing Using Reversible Chain Terminators
One of the drawbacks of pyrosequencing is that each of the four nucleotides must 
be added to the reaction sequentially in separate cycles thereby slowing down 
the overall process. The sequencing reaction could be speeded up considerably 
if all the nucleotides were added together. However, to do this, it is necessary to 
ensure that the growing DNA strands are extended by only a single nucleotide dur-
ing each cycle and that the incorporated nucleotides are recognized individually. 
This can be done using reversible chain terminators each labeled with a different 
colored fluorescent dye (Fig. 4.4).
To do this, the 3′ carbons of the deoxyribose sugar must be derivatized (capped) 
with a chemical group that blocks subsequent addition of nucleotides, and then, 
a different fluorophore must be attached to each nucleotide (without interfering 
with either base pairing or phosphodiester bond formation). In this case, both the 
3′ blocking group and the fluorescent dye are designed to be quickly and easily 
removable. Also, the decapping step restores a hydroxyl group at the 3′ position of 
the deoxyribose sugars to provide a site for phosphodiester bond formation with 
the next nucleotide. In practice, once fluorescent emissions have been recorded, 
only 30 s are needed to remove both the 3′ blocking group and the fluorescent dye 
from each incorporated nucleotide and to leave a hydroxyl group at the 3′ posi-
tion of the deoxyribose sugars. Cycles of nucleotide addition to the growing DNA 
strand by DNA polymerase, acquisition of fluorescence data, and chemical cleav-
age of the blocking and dye groups are repeated to generate short sequence deter-
minations of up to 36 nucleotides per run. A large number of overlapping short 
DNA fragments are assembled by computer into much larger DNA sequences.
4.1.5  Sequencing by Ligation
In contrast to the abovementioned methods, which extend the growing DNA strand 
by a single base during each cycle, sequencing by ligation extends the DNA strand 
by ligation of short oligonucleotides in a template-dependent fashion and utilizes 
the enzyme ligase rather than DNA polymerase. This procedure requires oligo-
nucleotides that are usually 9 nucleotides in length and are partially degenerate. 

103
Fig. 4.4   Examples of reversible chain terminators. A different fluorescent dye (colored struc-
tures) is linked to each nucleotide by means of a blocking group and a linker sequence at position 
9 of the purines [guanine (a) and adenine (b)] and position 5 of the pyrimidines [cytosine (c) 
and uracil (d)]. Note that uracil rather than thymidine is utilized here. Following each step, both 
the blocking group (that prevents chain extension) and the fluorescent dye are cleaved from the 
growing DNA chain so that another nucleotide can be added in the next cycle. © 2010 American

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
That is, they contain a known nucleotide at a specific (query) position and random 
nucleotides in the other positions. Moreover, all the 9-mers with the same fixed 
nucleotide, regardless of position, are tagged at their 3′ ends with the same fluo-
rescent dye. Each of the four different fluorescent dyes emits light of a distinctive 
wavelength that can be used to identify the nucleotide in the query position.
A sequencing cycle consists of the following (Fig.  4.5). (i) A short nucleo-
tide adaptor is joined to the ends of the DNA fragments that are to be sequenced. 
(ii) The template (target) DNA plus the nucleotide adaptor is denatured, and the 
anchor primer binds to its complementary sequence in the adaptor at the 3′ end 
of the template DNA. (iii) A pool of 9-mers with fixed nucleotides A, G, C, and 
T at the same query position, e.g., position 1 (Fig. 4.5c) or position 2 (Fig. 4.5d), 
is added and incubated briefly with the enzyme T4 DNA ligase. (iv) Ligation 
between the anchor primer and the 9-mer requires a 100 % match between the 
9-mer and the template sequence. Following the ligation step, all of the non-
ligated 9-mers are washed away, and the fluorescent signal is recorded. The 
i­dentity of the nucleotide at each position is determined by the wavelength of the 
fluorescence that is produced at each step. (v) The ligated anchor primer (9-mer) 
sequence is removed by increasing the temperature, and the cycle is repeated using 
another pool of 9-mers with fixed nucleotides A, G, C, and T in the next query

position (to identify the nucleotide in the next position on the template). A very 
large number of these cycles are required to determine the sequences of many 
short regions of DNA that are ultimately assembled by computer into sequences of 
much larger stretches of DNA.
4.2  Large-Scale DNA Sequencing
In the more than 30  years, since Sanger and Gilbert shared the Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry, both the cost of DNA sequencing and the amount of time need to 
acquire DNA sequences have decreased by several orders of magnitude. These 
dramatic changes are a direct result of the introduction of automated DNA 
sequencers that run up to 384 capillary electrophoretic separations concurrently 
and can generate several million bases of DNA sequence information per day. 
The success of the dideoxynucleotide method is due to the highly accurate, long 
sequence reads of about 500–700 bases per sequencing reaction that makes it rela-
tively straightforward to definitively determine overlapping sequences and thereby 
to assemble the nucleotide sequence of a genome, chromosome, or large gene. 
However, this method is time-consuming, due to the requirement for electropho-
retic separation of the fragments, and expensive due to the relatively large volumes 
of chemicals that are needed. Therefore, using the techniques described above, 
various strategies have been devised for large-scale DNA sequencing.
4.2.1  Shotgun Cloning Strategy
The shotgun cloning strategy may be used for sequencing of prokaryotic, eukary-
otic, or viral genomes. First, the genomic DNA is randomly physically fragmented 
leaving extended (frayed) ends that make conventional cloning of these fragments 
extremely difficult. Consequently, the fragments are enzymatically made blunt ended 
using T4 DNA polymerase and then phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase.
Next, the fragments are separated into small (~1  kb), medium (~8  kb), and 
large (~40  kb) fractions with which three DNA libraries are created. Following 
transformation of E. coli with the library, vector DNA, carrying target genomic 
DNA, is purified from each library. Subsequently, 384 DNA fragments are ana-
lyzed concurrently. To achieve a high degree of accuracy, each nucleotide site in a 
genome is sequenced approximately 6–10 different times from different fragments.
A computer program assesses the fluorescence after each step and designates 
the nucleotides that most likely correspond to unambiguous peaks. Then, a differ-
ent computer program finds overlapping segments and produces long, contiguous 
stretches of nucleotides (contigs).
To determine the sequence of a larger region of the DNA, the various contigs 
must be linked together. This may require additional cloning and sequencing. After 
4.1  Next-Generation DNA Sequencing

106
4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
this has been done, small gaps between contigs that remain are typically resolved 
either by PCR of high-molecular-weight genomic DNA across each gap, followed 
by sequencing the amplification product(s), or by primer walking. The sequences 
adjacent to the gaps provide the information for determining the primer sequences.
4.2.2  Cyclic Array Sequencing
Cloning DNA fragments into plasmids, transforming the plasmids into bacterial 
cells, and then picking and extracting the plasmids from thousands to millions 
of colonies for sequencing are very time-consuming and expensive, even though 
many of these steps have been automated. To make this procedure simpler and less 
expensive, cyclic array sequencing strategies have been developed that (1) prepare 
libraries of DNA fragments for sequencing in vitro, (2) immobilize the sequenc-
ing templates in a dense array on a surface so that very small volumes of reagents 
are required for the sequencing reactions, and (3) utilize a sequencing-by-synthe-
sis approach so that hundreds of millions of sequences can be acquired simultane-
ously (in parallel).
Cell-free methods have been developed to construct libraries of sequencing 
templates that circumvent the requirement for preparation of clone libraries in bac-
terial cells. Instead, PCR is used to produce clonal clusters containing millions of 
copies of each template DNA molecule that are separated from other sequences. 
One cyclic array sequencing strategy entails capturing the PCR-amplified sequenc-
ing templates on the surface of a small bead, arraying the beads in wells of a plate, 
and then using pyrosequencing to determine the sequences of the captured tem-
plates. This strategy is often referred to as 454 sequencing after the company (454 
Life Sciences) that developed the technology.
4.2.3  Using DNA Sequences
With the advances in our ability to rapidly determine the sequence of large 
amounts of DNA, it is currently possible to sequence entire bacterial and plant 
genomes. By mid-2014, the complete genome sequence of several thousand bacte-
rial and a few plant genomes has been determined. Moreover, the completely char-
acterized bacterial genomes include more than 100 different bacterial strains that 
specifically interact with plants, including both PGPB and phytopathogens. A rep-
resentation of the genome sequence of the PGPB Pseudomonas sp. UW4 is shown 
in Fig. 4.6.
At a first glance, the amount of data contained in a complete genome sequence 
may seem overwhelming. Thus, many bacteria genomes contain approxi-
mately one to ten million base pairs (bp) of DNA. However, these data may be 
readily analyzed using widely available computer software. For example, it 

107
was determined that the entire genome of Pseudomonas sp. UW4 contains 
6,183,388 bp of DNA, a G+C content of 60.05 %, 5,570 predicted protein coding 
genes, and 22 ribosomal RNA and 72 tRNA genes in seven separate clusters. More 
detailed analysis of the encoded proteins reveals that this bacterium contains genes 
for a number of traits that are often associated with PGPB. For example, as shown 
in Fig.  4.7, Pseudomonas sp. UW4 encodes seven enzymes that appear to be 
involved in the biosynthesis of the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). These 
seven enzymes appear to synthesize IAA via two different (but overlapping) bio-
synthetic pathways. This information provides a starting point for experimentally 
dissecting, and therefore better understanding the functioning of, this pathway(s). 
Thus, knowledge of the genomic sequence of this PGPB should enable investi-
gators to use PCR to isolate any or all of the putative IAA biosynthesis genes, 
to construct mutants in these putative pathways and to over-produce any of the 
enzymes involved in this pathway and study them biochemically.

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
Recently, based on PGPB genomic sequence data, a method has been developed 
whereby some of the key genes that are involved in determining whether a PGPB 
is endophytic or rhizospheric in its localization within the plant may be identi-
fied. Researchers collected two sets of genomic DNA sequence data: One data set 
included the complete genome sequence of nine endophytic Burkholderia spp. 
PGPB strains, while the other data set included the complete genome sequence of 
three rhizospheric Burkholderia spp. PGPB strains. First, the endophytic strains 
were compared with one another and the genes that were present in all of the nine 
strains were noted. The same procedure was performed for the three rhizospheric 
strains. Then, the set of conserved rhizospheric genes were subtracted from the con-
served set of endophytic genes (Fig. 4.8). This procedure resulted in the identifica-
tion of 40 genes that were tentatively identified as being specifically involved in the 
ability of Burkholderia spp. PGPB strains to function endophytically. This result is 
consistent with the notion that different endophytes might be expected to contain at 
least a minimal set of so-called endophytic genes. Moreover, a number of the identi-
fied genes had previously been suggested (by various experimental procedures) to be 
involved in endophytic colonization of their plant hosts.
As the genomic DNA sequences of an increasing number of PGPB are deter-
mined, it should be possible for researchers to use this information to gain a much 
more sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms and functioning of these 
bacteria.

4.3  The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The polymerase chain reaction, commonly called PCR, is a simple and highly 
effective means of generating large quantities of a specific fragment of DNA. With 
this procedure, developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis, who was subsequently awarded 
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, DNA fragments from ~100 to ~35,000 bp in 
length may be amplified several million times. Since its early development, PCR 
has become a mainstay of modern molecular biology. It is commonly used as a 
component of DNA cloning and sequencing, in directed mutagenesis protocols 
and as a key element in a wide range of DNA diagnostic procedures. PCR may be 
used to amplify whole genes or gene fragments, to chemically synthesize genes, 
to detect the presence of very low levels of target DNA and to produce genes with 
specific changes in their DNA.
A PCR amplification reaction (Fig. 4.9) typically includes the DNA that is targeted 
for amplification, two synthetic oligonucleotide primers (~20 nucleotides each) that are 
complementary to the ends of the target DNA sequence, a DNA polymerase that can 
withstand being repeatedly heated to approximately 95 °C and copies the DNA tem-
plate with high fidelity, and a vast molar excess of the four deoxyribonucleotides (DNA 
building blocks) over the target DNA. In each PCR cycle, the quantity of target DNA 
is doubled. Each cycle of DNA synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme DNA polymerase, 
that is, added at the very beginning of the procedure. All of the steps of a PCR cycle 
are carried out in a programmable block heater. In the first step, the double-stranded 
DNA in the sample is denatured (i.e., made single stranded) as a consequence of rais-
ing the temperature to 95 °C. This step typically lasts about 1 min. In the second step, 
which also last about 1 min, the reaction mixture is slowly cooled to ~55 °C, allowing 
the primers to bind (anneal) to complementary sites on the target DNA. In the third 
step, lasting about 2 min, the temperature is raised to ~75 °C which is near the optimal 
temperature of the thermostable DNA polymerase. DNA synthesis is initiated at the 3′ 
hydroxyl end of each primer, and both strands of the template DNA are copied.

primers 1 and 2

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
If DNA that is amplified in a PCR reaction is labeled with a fluorescent dye, it 
is possible to monitor the production of the PCR products in real time. In addition, 
the technique of real-time PCR allows a researcher to quantitate the amount of a 
specific DNA fragment in the starting material.
PCR may be used in a variety of ways in the study of plant–microbe interac-
tions. For example, when all or a portion of the genomic DNA sequence of a bac-
terium is known, PCR may be used to amplify and then isolate genes of interest 
within the characterized region of the genome; PCR may also be used to aid in 
strategies to express the isolated gene in a new host strain. PCR may be employed 
as a tool to construct mutants of specific target genes and/or their regulatory 
regions, thereby facilitating a better understanding of the role of that gene in the 
functioning of the bacterium. PCR may be utilized in the synthesis of whole genes 
that are being introduced into a test bacterium. And, of course, PCR may also be 
used to facilitate the isolation, characterization, and genetic manipulation of plant, 
as well as bacterial, genes.
4.3.1  Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR (RT-PCR, also called quantitative PCR or Q-PCR) is a technique 
where target DNA is simultaneously amplified and quantified. With this method, 
DNA that is amplified is labeled with the fluorescent dye SYBR green as the 
double-stranded DNA forms, and it is possible to monitor the fluorescence that 
results when the dye that is bound to double-stranded DNA (the product of the 
reaction) is irradiated with light. The SYBR green dye is excited using blue light 
(λmax = 488 nm) and it emits green light (λmax = 522 nm). This approach allows 
researchers to quantify the amount of a specific DNA fragment in any particular 
sample. In the simplest approach to labeling DNA, researchers add dyes that bind 
to double-stranded DNA and emit fluorescence, and the fluorescence intensity 
increases in proportion to the concentration of double-stranded DNA (Fig. 4.10).
Compared to other techniques, real-time PCR offers a dramatic improvement in 
both the sensitivity of detection and the time that it takes to complete the analysis. 
Real-time PCR occurs in four phases. First, for ~10–15 cycles (linear phase), fluo-
rescence emission at each cycle does not rise above the background level. Then, 
in the early exponential phase, the fluorescence reaches a threshold at which it is 
significantly higher than the background. The cycle at which this occurs is known 
as the threshold cycle and is inversely correlated with the amount of target DNA 
in the original sample. During the next (exponential) phase, the amount of product 
doubles in each cycle, while in the final (plateau) stage, the reaction components 
become limited and measurements of the fluorescence intensity are no longer use-
ful. To quantitate the amount of target DNA in a sample, a standard curve is first 
generated by serially diluting a sample with a known number of copies of the tar-
get DNA, and the threshold values for each dilution are plotted against the starting 
amount of sample. The amount of a target DNA in a sample is estimated from 

111
the threshold value for the sample and extrapolating the starting amount from the 
standard curve.
4.4  Transcriptomics
A key question in developing a deeper understanding of the interaction between 
plants and various microbes is what is the nature of the changes in the physiology 
and biochemistry of the plant that occur as a consequence of its interaction with 
a particular microorganism (Fig. 4.11). And, of course, the corresponding ques-
tion is what are the nature of the changes in the physiology and biochemistry of 
the microorganism that occur as a consequence of its interaction with a particu-
lar plant (Fig. 4.11). These two questions may be addressed by monitoring gene 
expression either by transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics (all of which 
are described below). Often, the results of monitoring changes in gene expres-
sion will provide scientists with information about the activation or inhibition of a 
particular metabolic pathway as a consequence of a specific treatment (Fig. 4.12). 
Unlike most traditional biological experiments that are hypothesis driven, tran-
scriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics experiments are said to be hypothesis 
generating. A less flattering way of characterizing these types of experiments is to 
say that they are sometimes considered to be fishing expeditions where you never 
know ahead of time exactly what you are going to find, or if you will find anything 
meaningful.
Transcriptomics, which is also called functional genomics, is concerned with 
determining which genes are expressed under a particular set of conditions and 
the levels of expression (i.e., transcription) of those genes. Transcription, within 
the context of plant–microbe interactions, is typically assessed as the response 
Fig. 4.10   The principle behind real-time PCR. The fluorescent dye SYBR green does not bind 
to single-stranded DNA and does not fluoresce when it is free in solution (a). As the DNA is 
amplified in the PCR reaction, the dye binds to the double-stranded regions and fluoresces (b). 
All of the completely amplified double-stranded DNA contains bound and fluorescing dye (c). 
The amount of fluorescence is proportional to the amount of bound dye which is directly related 
to the amount of double-stranded DNA

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
of plants to the presence of either phytopathogens, plant growth-promoting bac-
teria, abiotic stressors or some combination of these factors. In principle, this 
approach could also be used to assess the effect of plants, plant extracts, or plant 
exudates on the transcription of plant associated bacteria; however, this technique 
is only rarely used for this purpose. A transcriptomics approach aims to discover 
the genes that are either up- or down-regulated under specific conditions. In the 
past, the transcription of only one or a few genes could be followed at a time. The 
approach outlined below permits researchers to track the simultaneous transcrip-
tion of hundreds or even thousands of genes. However, it is important to keep in 
mind, in addition to monitoring newly synthesized transcripts, DNA microarray 
technology also examines DNA transcripts that are rapidly turned over.
4.4.1  DNA Microarray Technology
In one type of commercially available microarray system, approximately 28,000 
different oligonucleotides (each 60 nucleotides long) that are complementary to 
Fig. 4.11   Schematic view of monitoring the physiological and biochemical effects of plants and 
soil microorganisms on one another

113
portions of the DNA sequence of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana are syn-
thesized directly on a solid surface. Thousands of copies of an oligonucleotide 
with the same specific nucleotide sequence are synthesized in a pre-defined posi-
tion on the array surface. About 10,000 different probes can be arrayed in a 1-cm2 
area. Because A. thaliana has a quite small genome (135 × 106 bp, or about 20 
times the size of a typical soil pseudomonad genome), the 28,000 nucleotides cor-
respond to approximately 80 % of the entire genome of this plant. However, for 
most other plants, a complete whole-genome oligonucleotide array would require 
more than 500,000 probes.
Generally, computer programs determine probe sequences that are specific for 
their target sequences, are least likely to hybridize with nontarget sequences, have 
no secondary structure that would prevent hybridization with the target sequence, 
and have similar melting (annealing) temperatures, so that all target sequences 
can bind to their complementary probe sequences under essentially the same 
conditions. Repetitive sequences are not included in genomic DNA microarrays. 
Thus, to design a highly effective DNA microarray, it is essential that the DNA 
sequences of a large number of plant genes, and preferably the entire genome 
sequence, of the target plant, are known.
Typically, for most gene expression profiling experiments that utilize microar-
rays, mRNA is extracted from plant tissues and purified, and cDNA is synthesized 
using the enzyme reverse transcriptase and the extracted mRNA as a template. 
Usually, mRNA is extracted from two or more sources whose expression profiles 
Fig. 4.12   Schematic view of activation and inhibition of metabolic pathways. These effects on 
various pathways may be inferred by monitoring changes in the amounts of either mRNAs, pro-
teins, or metabolites. In this figure, the blue dots represent the unperturbed level of gene expres-
sion of a plant tissue or a bacterium. In the unperturbed state, all of the dots would be shown as 
blue. When the system is perturbed, for example, adding a PGPB to a plant or adding salt to a 
bacterial culture, the expression of some genes may increase (shown using green dots), while the 
expression of other genes may decrease (shown using orange dots). Increased or decreased gene 
expression is generally detected throughout an entire pathway. The arrow indicates the direction 
of metabolic flux through the indicated pathways

114

are compared, for example, from untreated plants versus plants treated with either 
a phytopathogen or a PGPB. The cDNA from each plant source is labeled with 
a different fluorophore by incorporating fluorescently labeled nucleotides during 
cDNA synthesis. For example, a green-emitting fluorescent dye (Cy3) may be 
used for the normal (untreated) sample and a red-emitting fluorescent dye (Cy5) 
for the sample treated with a PGPB (Fig. 4.13). After being labeled, the cDNA 
samples are mixed and hybridized to the same microarray. A laser scanner deter-
mines the intensities of bound Cy5 and Cy3 for each oligonucleotide probe. Each 
spot may have a different color depending on the relative expression levels of the 
gene in that spot in the two samples (Fig. 4.13). To avoid any experimental varia-
tion due to differences in labeling efficiencies between Cy3 and Cy5, the samples 
are usually reverse labeled and hybridized to another microarray. In this example, 
reverse labeling (also called dye swapping) would entail labeling the untreated 
sample with Cy5 and PGPB-treated sample with Cy3.
Fig.  4.13   Schematic overview of a DNA microarray experiment. Tissues are isolated from 
treated and untreated plants; the mRNA is extracted from those tissues; using the mRNAs as tem-
plates, cDNA is synthesized and then labeled with a dye that will fluoresce when irradiated with 
a specific laser; the labeled cDNAs are hybridized to oligonucleotides (or DNA fragments) bound 
to a microscope slide; finally, the dye fluoresces after being irradiated with a laser with the fluo-
rescence signal being visualized, captured and stored on computer

115
Notwithstanding, the fact that there are many variations in the details of 
this  experimental technique, using microarrays permits researchers to monitor 
changes to the abundance of a large number of different plant mRNAs (hundreds 
to ­thousands) that occur as a consequence of a range of different treatments.
Because of the large amount of data generated by microarray experiments, spe-
cialized software has been developed to maximize the output of information. Each 
spot (probe cell) of a two-dye hybridized microarray is scanned using a confocal 
scanning microscope. Following laser excitation of the dye, fluorescence emitted 
from each probe cell, detected at both 532 and 635 nm for Cy3 and Cy5, respec-
tively, is collected and converted to an electrical signal. The intensities of fluores-
cence emitted by both dyes for each probe cell, along with background readings 
for the microarray, are recorded and stored. To minimize errors, multiple probe 
cells for each gene are included on a single microarray, and replicate samples are 
independently prepared under the same conditions and hybridized to different 
microarrays.
One of the major purposes of a microarray experiment is to identify genes 
whose expression changes in response to a particular biological condition. The 
response to a biological condition is determined by comparing the fluorescence 
intensity for each gene (as measured in each probe cell), averaged among repli-
cates. The log ratios for all probe cells are compiled into a table called an expres-
sion matrix.
Microarray analysis is also used to identify genes that are co-expressed under 
different conditions or over a period of time, with the goal of determining which 
gene products function in a given pathway. A number of computational strate-
gies are available that organize the data into related groups (clusters). For a clear 
presentation of the clustered data, ranges of log ratio values are assigned arbitrary 
colors. Usually, black is designated for a log ratio of zero, dark to bright red for 
increasing positive log ratios, and dark to bright green for decreasing negative 
log ratios. In other words, red is frequently used to denote gene overexpression 
and green to denote under-expression. A visualized representation of a clustered 
microarray is called a gene expression profile, where the rows represent the reor-
dered genes and the columns represent either conditions or samples.
4.5  Proteomics
In the mid-1970s, Patrick O’Farrell, who was at that time a graduate student at 
the University of Colorado, developed a high-resolution two-dimensional gel elec-
trophoresis system that was able to separate and visualize approximately 1,100 
E. coli proteins on a single slab gel. This pioneering work that enabled scientists to 
monitor changes in the cellular concentrations of hundreds of proteins at the same 
time has opened the door to a wide range of possible applications and together 
with other technical developments has led to the development of the field that is 
called proteomics.
4.4  Transcriptomics

116
4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
With the O’Farrell procedure, a protein mixture is first separated into individual 
protein components in a thin tube gel using isoelectric focusing (which separates 
proteins on the basis of their overall charge). After the gel has been run, the fragile 
gel is carefully removed from the glass tube and placed on the top of a standard 
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide slab gel. The isoelectric focusing 
separated proteins (which are now localized in multiple sites along the length of 
the tube gel) are then electro-transferred onto an SDS polyacrylamide gel, and 
they are subsequently separated when an electric current is applied (separating 
proteins on the basis of their size). After the slab gel has been run, it is stained to 
visualize the proteins that were present in the original sample (Fig. 4.14). The gel 
may be stained with the dye Coomassie Blue, for greater sensitivity silver stain-
ing may be used, or for much greater sensitivity (i.e., the ability to visualize much 
lower levels of protein) with the fluorescent dyes Cy3 and/or Cy5 (see Sect. 4.4.1). 
One technical problem with two-dimensional gels is the difficulty in detecting pro-
teins whose abundance is relatively low, such as regulatory proteins, signal trans-
duction proteins, and receptor proteins.
Once the gel has been run, it is necessary to identify individual proteins from 
the many spots that can be visualized. In one method, individual proteins are 
eluted from the gel and digested with a proteolytic enzyme (such as trypsin or 
papain), and the resulting peptide mixtures are analyzed by mass spectrometry 
(MS) with each protein generating a unique peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) which 
can be compared to previously characterized proteins found in existing protein 
databases, thereby enabling the identification of the target protein. Identification of 
any individual protein is achieved when there is a match between the PMF of the 
target protein and a specific protein in one of the databases.
To compare protein expression levels under different conditions, it is pos-
sible to quantify the amount of protein produced in one set of conditions, e.g., 
Fig. 4.14   Example of a 
two-dimensional gel stained 
with Coomassie Blue. The

electrophoresis in the second 
dimension

117
the absence of stress and then compare this to the amount of production of the 
same protein under different condition, e.g., the presence of stress (Fig.  4.15). 
Unfortunately, this approach often causes dramatic variability as a result of gel-to-
gel variation when each test sample is separated on a different gel.
To avoid problems of gel to gel variation, a common way of comparing protein 
expression levels under different conditions employs the method called “differen-
tial in-gel electrophoresis” or DIGE (Fig.  4.16). The DIGE technique separates 
two or more samples on the same gel so that real and meaningful biological 
changes can be readily identified. Briefly, test and control samples are labeled with 
different fluorescent dyes (e.g., Cy3 and Cy5). These dyes exhibit both high sen-
sitivity and a wide dynamic range in detection. Equal amounts of the differently 
labeled protein samples are then mixed and subjected to two-dimensional electro-
phoresis separation on the same gel, ensuring that identical proteins from separate 
samples co-migrate and that their fluorescence images are superimposed, thereby 
enabling more accurate differential expression analysis. The protein expression 
ratios between the samples are defined in the subsequent image analysis by com-
parison with the normalized intensities of each protein spot from the Cy3 and Cy5 
channels. Overall, the DIGE technique is exceptionally reproducible, accurate, and 
sensitive.
It is important to bear in mind that the results that are obtained from gene 
expression studies (transcriptomics) and protein expression studies (proteomics) 
may show some significant differences in terms of assessing how various treat-
ments affect gene expression. This is because, on the one hand, transcriptomics 
monitors changes in transcripts (mRNAs) that are both newly synthesized and rap-
idly turned over. On the other hand, proteomics monitors the presence of stable 
proteins and does not generally distinguish between existing and newly synthe-
sized proteins. Therefore, the results of these studies are expected to be comple-
mentary rather than identical.

4.6  Metabolomics
With recent developments in mass spectrometry (MS), it is possible to rapidly and 
simultaneously measure thousands of different metabolites from relatively small 
samples. With the right tools, it is possible to assess the metabolome (the com-
plete collection of metabolites, or small molecules) of a plant tissue or group of 
bacterial cells under any specific set of conditions. Moreover, as with transcrip-
tomics and proteomics, it is possible to readily identify changes in an organism’s 
metabolome as a consequence of changing environmental conditions (regardless 
of whether those conditions are biotic or abiotic).
Fig. 4.16   Differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Protein extracts (of the same bacteria or 
plant tissue, subjected to different treatments) and internal standards are typically labeled with 
different dyes and then mixed together. The mixed protein extract is separated by two-dimen-
sional electrophoresis before the gel is imaged at wavelengths unique to each of the fluorescent 
label dyes. A computer comparison of the fluorescent images at each wavelength is used to indi-
cate which proteins have increased expression and which have decreased expression. Protein 
spots may be identified by mass spectrometry

119
Scientists have defined two different types of metabolomics experiments, targeted 
and non-targeted. In targeted metabolomics, the experiment is designed to measure a 
limited number of specific metabolites, typically from one or more related biochemi-
cal pathways. These types of studies are often driven by efforts to study a specific 
pathway and are dependent upon having extensive information about the system 
being investigated prior to the start of the experiment. On the other hand, untargeted 
metabolic studies are intended to simultaneously measure the concentrations of as 
many metabolites as possible including metabolites that may be unknown or poorly 
characterized (Fig. 4.17). Untargeted metabolomics is potentially quite complex in 
that it has the potential to detect and quantify several thousand compounds at once 
and in a highly reproducible manner. Moreover, changes in the concentrations of 
various metabolites that occur in response to environmental stimuli can provide a 
strong indication of how the test organism copes with different environments.
In untargeted metabolomics, metabolites are extracted from biological samples, 
separated by liquid chromatography, analyzed by high-resolution MS, and finally, the

4  Some Techniques to Elaborate Plant–Microbe Interactions
resultant data are quantified by computer and may then be compared to similar sam-
ples that are treated differently (Fig. 4.17). Notwithstanding, the ability of this system 
to resolve a large number of different compounds, all of the peaks of interest need 
to be individually identified (structurally characterized). From the mass spectrometry 
data, the mass to charge ratio of individual peaks is identified and compared to data-
bases of known compounds. For uncommon or unknown compounds, a number of 
additional (and often complex) procedures may be required to identify them.
Metabolomics is a relatively recent technique that requires relatively sophis-
ticated equipment to resolve, separate, and measure all of the metabolites in 
an organism. Thus, at the present time, there are only a very limited number of 
reports of this technique being used to study plant–microbe interactions. However, 
because of the potential of this approach, it is likely that this technique will be 
employed with increasing frequency because the data that can be obtained from 
metabolomics studies is a logical complement to similar data from transcriptomics 
and proteomics experiments.

5.1  Phytopathogens
It has been estimated that various plant diseases reduce plant yields by ~10 % per 
year in the more developed countries and by >20 % per year in the less devel-
oped countries of the world. From the perspective of many farmers in the devel-
oped world, the control of plant diseases is often not considered to be problematic. 
Plant disease control may be achieved by use of plants that have been bred for 
good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop 
rotation, the use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant den-
sity, control of field moisture, and, perhaps most importantly, the use of pesticides. 
Independent of human intervention, plants can synthesize a variety of phytochemi-
cals as secondary metabolites and many of these chemicals have antimicrobial 
properties and can, to some extent, protect plants against diseases caused by dif-
ferent pathogens. Interestingly, some of these secondary metabolites are useful in 
treating a wide range of human diseases.
A wide variety of infectious organisms can cause plant diseases including 
fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, phytoplasmas, protozoa, and nematodes. 
Fungi and bacteria cause the majority of common plant diseases. Most of the 
phytopathogenic fungi belong to the Ascomycetes and the basidiomycetes. Some 
important disease-causing Ascomycetes include Fusarium spp., Thielaviopsis 
spp., Verticillium spp., Magnaporthe grisea, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Some 
common disease-causing basidiomycetes include Ustilago spp., Rhizoctonia spp., 
Phakospora pachyrhizi, and Puccinia spp. Fungal pathogens that are biotrophic 
colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living plant cells. On the 
other hand, fungal pathogens that are necrotrophic infect and kill plant tissue, and 
subsequently extract nutrients from the dead plant cells. Fungal diseases are typi-
cally controlled through the use of fungicides. A smaller number of bacteria than 
fungi can cause disease in plants. Pathogenic bacteria include some species of

5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas. Many of the chemicals that are 
used to control phytopathogens are hazardous to animals and humans, and they 
persist and accumulate in natural ecosystems. It is therefore desirable to replace 
these chemical agents with biological control agents that are more “friendly” to 
the environment.
To decrease our dependence upon use of chemical pesticides or, ideally, to 
avoid their use altogether, scientists have been studying PGPB that are able to act 
as biocontrol agents utilizing a wide range of strategies to limit the growth and 
pathogenicity of fungal and bacterial phytopathogens. This chapter presents an 
overview of some of the most prominent of the strategies that are used by some 
PGPB strains that act as biocontrol agents. While some researchers consider bio-
control bacteria to be separate and distinct from PGPB that directly promote plant 
growth, here, biocontrol bacteria are considered to be PGPB that employ mecha-
nisms that are intended to indirectly promote plant growth, by limiting pathogen 
inhibition of plant growth and proliferation.
5.2  Antibiotics
One of the major mechanisms that PGPB use to control plant pathogens is the 
ability of the biocontrol strain to synthesize one or more antibiotics. The antibiot-
ics synthesized by biocontrol PGPB include, but are not limited to, agrocin 84, 
amphisin, bacillomycin, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, fengycin, herbicolin, iturin, 
oomycin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, surfactin, tensin, 
and viscosinamide (Fig. 5.1). In fact, the biocontrol activity of a number of strains 
is directly related to the ability of the bacterium to produce one or more of these 
antibiotics. However, an antibiotic that is effective in the laboratory against one 
strain of a pathogenic agent may not prevent the damage to the plant that occurs 
as a consequence of other strains of the same pathogen and may behave differently 
than expected under more variable field conditions. For example, the expression 
of bacterial antibiotic biosynthesis genes is often dependent upon the nutritional 
environment provided by the host plant. In addition, the effectiveness of a bio-
control organism can be significantly affected by the way in which the biocontrol 
PGPB are grown in culture as well as how they are formulated for application.
By limiting the proliferation of other soil microorganisms, antibiotic-secreting 
biocontrol plant growth-promoting bacteria facilitate their own proliferation since 
they will have fewer competitors for the limited nutritional resources found in 
most soils. In this way, biocontrol PGPB create a niche for themselves to function 
and stimulate plant growth directly as well as indirectly.
Evidence for the involvement of antibiotics in disease suppression by biocon-
trol PGPB comes from experiments in which mutant strains of disease-suppressive 
bacteria that were no longer able to produce antibiotics concomitantly lost either 
all or a substantial portion of the ability to prevent the damage to plants caused by 
phytopathogens. Moreover, in several instances it has been possible to isolate and 

125
purify specific antibiotics from biocontrol PGPB and subsequently demonstrate 
that the purified antibiotics were inhibitory to the same spectrum of fungal phy-
topathogens as the biocontrol strain itself.
One way to improve the efficacy of biocontrol PGPB strains is to genetically 
combine several biocontrol activities into a single bacterial strain. Thus, in one 
experiment the operon carrying all seven of the genes that encode the biosynthe-
sis of the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (i.e., phzABCDEFG) was inserted 
into the chromosomal DNA of a PGPB strain of P. fluorescens using the trans-
poson Tn5 (Fig. 5.2a). Despite the fact that the wild-type version of this bacte-
rium does not synthesize phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, it nevertheless acts as 
a biocontrol agent against some fungal diseases. As indicated by a much larger 
zone of clearance of the fungal pathogen Pythium ultimum on solid medium, 
the engineered bacterium has a higher level of biocontrol activity than the wild-
type strain (Fig. 5.2b). In addition to its activity on petri plates, the engineered

127
phenazine-1-carboxylic acid-producing bacterium prevented P. ultimum-caused 
damping-off disease in pea plants in soil. Besides manipulating antibiotic bio-
synthesis genes per se, antibiotic production can often be either increased or 
decreased to a significant extent by manipulating the expression of either the 
vegetative- or the stationary-phase sigma factor, thereby modulating antibiotic 
expression at the transcriptional level. While most antibiotics are preferentially 
synthesized during stationary phase, some are synthesized during vegetative phase 
so that overproduction of the appropriate sigma factor can increase the expression 
of genes normally expressed at a specific phase of bacterial growth. This work 
demonstrates the efficacy of this approach under greenhouse conditions; that is, by 
judicious manipulation, it is possible to engineer biocontrol strains that are more 
effective at producing antibiotics. Nevertheless, it remains to be demonstrated 
whether these altered bacteria are as effective in the field as they are in the labora-
tory. Moreover, it is likely that such manipulated bacteria may not be tested for 
some time because of the reluctance of regulatory agencies in many countries to 
agree to the field release of genetically engineered bacterial strains.
Sometimes, biocontrol PGPB strains lose their effectiveness in the laboratory or fol-
lowing long-term storage of bacterial cultures. This is often attributed to mutations in 
lemA or gacA genes, mutations that often occur at a high frequency and subsequently 
affect a whole range of biological activities including antibiotic biosynthesis.
At the present time, there is only one commercially available genetically 
engineered biocontrol bacterial strain. A modified version of the bacterium 
Agrobacterium radiobacter K84 has been marketed, first in Australia in 1989, and 
more recently all over the world, as a means of controlling crown gall disease. This 
disease, which is caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, deleteriously 
affects almond trees and stone fruit trees, such as peach trees (Fig. 5.3). The anti-
biotic agrocin 84, which is produced by A. radiobacter, is toxic to A. ­tumefaciens. 
However, agrocin 84-resistant strains of A. tumefaciens can develop following 
Fig. 5.2   Insertion of the phenazine biosynthesis operon into the chromosomal DNA of a bio-
control strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens (a). The regulatory genes that normally control the 
expression of the seven biosynthetic genes were removed, and the entire operon was placed 
under the control of the tac promoter (ptac). Since P. fluorescens does not utilize lactose as a 
carbon source, it does not encode the lac repressor, and in the absence of the lac repressor, any 
genes under the control of the tac promoter are expressed constitutively. The operon, under the 
control of the tac promoter, was inserted into a derivative of transposon Tn5 adjacent to a kan-
amycin resistance gene (not shown) on a plasmid. Tn5 facilitates integration of DNA into the 
chromosome of the host cell. Transconjugants in which the chromosomal insertion had not inac-
tivated any important bacterial functions were tested for their effectiveness as biocontrol strains. 
The Tn5 derivative is designed so that it does not easily pass from the biocontrol strain to other 
bacteria in the environment. Killing of the fungal pathogen Pythium ultimum around the bacte-
rial cells on an agar plate (b). The increased size of the zone of clearance around the engineered 
P. fluorescens (expressing the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid biosynthetic pathway) indi-
cates increased biocontrol activity preventing growth of the fungus on the medium. The antifun-
gal activity of the bacterium is approximately proportional to the area of the zone of clearance 
around the center of the petri plate to which the bacterium is added. © 2010 American Soci-

the genes encoding the biosynthesis of agrocin 84 is accidentally transferred from 
A. radiobacter to A. tumefaciens, a not unlikely occurrence. To avoid this possibility,

A.  radiobacter, which encodes both synthesis of and immunity to the antibiotic agrocin 84. 
Based on knowledge of the restriction enzyme map of pAgK84, a DNA fragment containing the 
transfer (Tra) region, together with some of the flanking DNA, is isolated (1) and spliced into an  
E. coli plasmid vector (2). By restriction enzyme digestion, approximately 80  % of the Tra 
region and some of the flanking DNA (a total of about 6 kb) are deleted from the cloned DNA 
containing the Tra sequence (3). Homologous recombination of the E. coli plasmid containing 
the deleted Tra region with plasmid pAgK84, in which transposon Tn5, which carries a kana-
mycin resistance gene, has been inserted into the Tra region, is performed (4). This results in 
some derivatives of pAgK84 in which a portion of the Tra region of the plasmid has been deleted  
(5). The resultant Tra− mutant of pAgK84 can no longer be conjugationally transferred to other 
agrobacteria, although it is still able to synthesize and provide immunity to agrocin 84. None 
of the DNA fragments is shown to scale. © 2010 American Society for Microbiology. Used

the region of DNA responsible for plasmid transfer was removed from the agrocin 
84 plasmid, pAgK84 (Fig. 5.4). As a result of the deletion of the tra (transfer) gene, 
the A. radiobacter strain retains the capacity to act as a biocontrol agent, but it can 
no longer transfer the plasmid to other bacteria including pathogenic agrobacteria.
5.3  HCN
Perhaps surprisingly, many biocontrol PGPB strains have the ability to synthe-
size hydrogen cyanide (HCN). In fact, many antibiotic-producing PGPB strains 
also synthesize HCN. By itself, the low level of HCN that is synthesized by some 
PGPB is unlikely to have much biocontrol activity. The one notable exception to 
this is that HCN produced by some strains of Pseudomonas spp. has been reported 
to suppress black root rot of tobacco caused by the fungus Thielaviopsis basicola. 
In most instances, it is thought that HCN probably acts synergistically with bac-
terially encoded antibiotics. In fact, the transfer of genes that encode HCN bio-
synthesis has been shown to increase the biocontrol activity of some bacteria. The 
synergism between antibiotic and HCN would likely help ensure that various path-
ogens do not develop resistance to specific antibiotics as such resistance would 
negate the effectiveness of an antibiotic-producing PGPB strain.
5.4  Siderophores
Iron is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth; however, it is not ready avail-
able in soil for direct assimilation by bacteria. This is because ferric ion, Fe+3, the 
predominant form of iron in nature, is only sparingly soluble, i.e., about 10−18 M 
at pH 7.4. In order to find sufficient iron for their growth and metabolism, soil 
bacteria synthesize and secrete low molecular mass (~400–1000 Da) iron-binding 
molecules known as siderophores. These molecules bind Fe+3 with a very high 
affinity (Kd = ~10−20 to ~10−50), transport the iron–siderophore complex back to 
the bacterial cell where it is taken up by means of an outer cell membrane recep-
tor, and then made available for bacterial growth.
PGPB have been shown to prevent the proliferation of phytopathogens, and thereby 
facilitate plant growth by synthesizing siderophores that bind a large part of the Fe+3 
that is present in the rhizosphere of the host plant. These biocontrol PGPB prevent fun-
gal and bacterial pathogens in the immediate vicinity of the roots of the host plant, 
where the biocontrol PGPB are bound, from obtaining sufficient iron for their growth 
so that they are unable to proliferate and act as pathogens because of a lack of iron 
(Fig. 5.5). While fungal and bacterial pathogens produce their own siderophores, the 
siderophores that they produce typically have a much lower affinity for iron than the 
biocontrol PGPB siderophores. In this way, the biocontrol PGPB effectively outcom-
pete fungal and bacterial phytopathogens for available iron.

131
Unlike phytopathogens, plants are not generally affected by the localized deple-
tion of iron in the soil caused by the siderophores that are produced by biocontrol 
PGPB. This is because most plants are able to grow at much lower iron concentra-
tions than most microorganisms. In addition, many plants can bind and take up 
the biocontrol PGPB iron–siderophore complex, transport it through the plant, and 
then reductively release the iron from the bacterial siderophore so that the iron can 
be used by the plant.
The ability of siderophores to act as effective “disease-suppressive” agents is 
affected by the particular crop plant, the specific phytopathogen being suppressed, 
the soil composition (including the nutrients and the microorganisms), the bacte-
rium that synthesizes the siderophore, and the affinity of the specific siderophore 
in question for iron. All of these possible variables suggest that even though a par-
ticular biocontrol PGPB is an effective disease-suppressive agent in the laboratory, 
its behavior in the field may be much more difficult to predict.
In addition, to the type of experiment shown in Fig. 5.5, several genetic stud-
ies of siderophore-producing PGPB are consistent with the involvement of sidero-
phores in the suppression of disease caused by fungal and bacterial pathogens. 
Thus, researchers have shown that siderophore-overproducing mutant PGPB 
strains are often more effective than the wild-type bacterium in controlling spe-
cific pathogens. Moreover, mutant strains of biocontrol PGPB that were selected 
for their loss of siderophore production concomitantly lost the ability, displayed 
by the wild-type strain, to protect tomato plants against damage from specific 
phytopathogens. In another study, it was observed that a single Tn5 insertion into 
the genome of the biocontrol PGPB Alcaligenes sp. strain MFA1 resulted in the 
Fig. 5.5   Schematic representation of a biocontrol PGPB preventing the proliferation of a phy-
topathogen. On the petri plates, the phytopathogen produces a lawn of growth over the entire 
plate. A colony of the biocontrol PGPB strain is growing in the center of each plate. The plate on 
the right contains a sufficient amount of added FeCl3 so that the biocontrol PGPB do not need to 
sequester iron in order to grow. Therefore, on the plate on the right, siderophore biosynthesis is 
not induced. In the absence of added iron, as seen on the plate on the left, the biocontrol PGPB 
synthesize and secrete siderophores that sequester the iron around the PGPB colony, thereby 
thwarting the growth of the pathogen and creating a zone of clearance

132
5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
simultaneous loss of the ability of the bacterium to grow in the absence of added 
iron, and to inhibit growth and development of the fungal pathogen Fusarium 
oxysporum.
It may be possible to improve biocontrol PGPB by extending the range of 
iron–siderophore complexes that a particular PGPB strain can utilize. In this case, 
a genetically altered biocontrol PGPB strain could take up and use siderophores 
that are synthesized by other soil microorganisms, thereby giving it a competitive 
advantage in the soil environment. It has been observed that some Pseudomonas 
spp. strains naturally possess from five to twenty outer membrane receptors, each 
of which can recognize and take up a single siderophore, or a set of siderophores 
with very similar structures. These siderophore receptors allow these strains to 
proliferate in the soil, and especially in the rhizosphere, at the expense of other 
soil bacteria.
5.5  Cell Wall-Degrading Enzymes
Plants often respond to infection by phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi by syn-
thesizing pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that are able to hydrolyze the cell 
walls of various fungal pathogens. Some biocontrol PGPB produce enzymes that 
are very similar to the plants’ PR proteins. These enzymes include chitinase which 
degrades chitin, a polymer of β-(1,4)-N-acetyl glucosamine residues and one of 
the main components of the cell wall of many phytopathogenic fungi (Fig. 5.6); 
β-1,3-glucanase; protease; and lipase, all of which can (at least partially) indi-
vidually lyse fungal cells (Fig. 5.7). In one example of the effectiveness of these 
enzymes, researchers isolated a strain of Pseudomonas stutzeri that produced 
both extracellular chitinase and laminarinase (a β-glucanase), and found that these 
enzymes could digest and lyse Fusarium solani mycelia and thereby prevent the 
fungus from causing crop loss due to root rot. In another experiment, a strain of 
the biocontrol PGPB Enterobacter agglomerans that possessed a complex of four 
separate enzymes responsible for the chitinolytic activity of the bacterium, and is 
antagonistic to various fungal phytopathogens, lost both chitinase and biocontrol

activities at the same time when the bacterium was mutagenized with Tn5. When 
the wild-type E. agglomerans was used as a biocontrol agent, it significantly 
decreased the damage to cotton plants following infection with Rhizoctonia solani; 
however, the mutants deficient in chitinase activity were unable to protect the plant 
against damage that was caused by the fungal pathogen.
It may seem a bit surprising that proteases can act on fungal pathogen cell 
walls. This is because most fungi have a cell wall consisting largely of chitin and 
other polysaccharides. However, fungal cell walls also contain some glycopro-
teins, and the chitin, the glucans, and the glycoproteins typically are covalently 
cross-linked. Thus, researchers have isolated a strain of Chryseobacterium aquati-
cum, a gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming rod that produces a novel 
antifungal protease. As a result of synthesizing this protease, this bacterium pos-
sesses a broad-spectrum antifungal activity that is effective against Rhizoctonia 
solani and Pseudocercospora theae.
Since many of the enzymes from biocontrol PGPB that can lyse fungal cells 
are encoded by a single gene, it is relatively straightforward to isolate some of 
these genes and then transfer them to strains of biocontrol PGPB that do not 
express these enzymes. In one series of experiments, a chitinase gene was ­isolated 
from the bacterium Serratia marcescens and then introduced (separately) into 
Trichoderma harzianum (a plant growth-promoting fungus) and Rhizobium 
meliloti. In both instances, the transformed microorganisms expressed chitinase 
activity and displayed a significant increase in antifungal activity. In a similar 
experiment, the S. marcescens chitinase gene was introduced into a biocontrol 
PGPB strain of P. fluorescens. As a consequence of this simple genetic manipula-
tion, the transformant stably expressed and secreted active chitinase and was con-
verted into a more effective biocontrol strain with increased activity against the 
phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani.
In addition to using root-colonizing biocontrol PGPB to thwart the develop-
ment of root pathogens, it is possible to use leaf-colonizing biocontrol PGPB to 
control phyllosphere pathogens. To this end, a chitinase gene from the marine 
Fig. 5.7   Schematic 
representation of a fungal cell 
wall being degraded by one 
or more enzymes produced 
by a biocontrol PGPB. 
Following the breakdown of 
the fungal cell wall, the cell is 
readily lysed

134
5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
bacterium Alteromonas sp. strain 79401 was introduced into the leaf-colonizing 
bacterium Erwinia ananas. The transformed E. ananas cells were sprayed onto 
the leaves of cucumber plants that were then inoculated with the fungal pathogen 
Botrytis cinerea (cucumber gray mold) in a greenhouse. Compared to untreated 
plants, plants treated with the transformed E. ananas cells were significantly pro-
tected against leaf damage by the fungal pathogen.
It has been observed that in the laboratory, plasmids carrying cloned chitinase 
genes are often rapidly lost from biocontrol PGPB in the absence of an antibiotic 
that selects for the presence of the plasmid. To avoid the problem of plasmid loss 
in the environment, the genes for chitinase or other fungal cell wall-degrading 
enzymes should be integrated directly into the chromosomal DNA of the relevant 
biocontrol PGPB.
5.6  Competition
In addition to mechanisms where a biocontrol PGPB produces a substance that 
kills or inhibits the functioning of pathogenic agents, some biocontrol PGPB may 
outcompete phytopathogens for nutrients and suitable niches on the root surface. 
That is, competition between pathogens and PGPB can limit plant disease inci-
dence and severity. In some instances, the more abundant PGPB may rapidly colo-
nize plant surfaces and use most of the available nutrients, making it difficult for 
the pathogens to grow.
When several leaf surface bacteria were tested as potential biocontrol (protec-
tive) agents against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, all 
of the Sphingomonas spp. strains that were isolated effectively protected plants 
against the pathogen. Sphingomonas sp. is a gram-negative, rod-shaped aerobic 
bacterium that is a highly competitive plant leaf colonizer. Notwithstanding the 
suggestion that it may be common for competitive phyllosphere colonizers to act 
as biocontrol strains, this particular study did not rule out the possibility that other 
mechanisms of biocontrol might also be operative. In addition, the Sphingomonas 
sp. strains that were isolated from air, dust or water did not act as biocontrol 
strains even though they were able to attain a high cell density on plant leaves. 
Thus, biocontrol activity is not necessarily a general trait among Sphingomonas 
spp. strains.
One group of researchers endeavored to identify the Sphingomonas sp. 
traits that are essential components of the bacterium’s ability to protect plants 
against the bacterial pathogen P. syringae (Fig.  5.8). Initially, a suspension of 
Sphingomonas sp. was mutagenized with a mini-Tn5 (which is randomly inserted 
into chromosomal DNA). Bacteria with a mini-Tn5 insertion were selected from 
a background of wild-type bacteria by their resistance to the antibiotic kanamy-
cin (carried by the mini-Tn5). The binding of the pathogen P. syringae to leaf 
surfaces was readily visualized as a consequence of the expression of lux genes 
that had been added to this bacterium, causing the bacterium to be luminescent. 

135
In the absence of any added biocontrol strain, all of the leaf surfaces examined 
are luminescent (i.e., they are infected with the pathogen). In the presence of the 
biocontrol strain, none of the leaf surfaces will be luminescent (i.e., no pathogen 
is present). In the presence of the mini-Tn5-mutagenized biocontrol strain, some 
of the leaf surfaces will be luminescent (i.e., the pathogen can bind when the traits

that make the biocontrol strain effective are disrupted). In the latter case, the mini-
Tn5 mutants that have lost biocontrol activity are isolated and their genomic DNA 
is purified and used to prepare a clone bank of genomic DNA in E. coli. From 
clones that contain the mini-Tn5, the DNA regions that are adjacent to the mini-
Tn5 are sequenced. These DNA sequences are used to identify proteins encoded 
by Sphingomonas sp. that are responsible for plant-protective traits. In this way, 
ten separate Sphingomonas sp. genes that mediate plant protection were identi-
fied. This clever approach is a possible first step in either selecting or constructing 
strains of Sphingomonas sp. that are more effective than the wild-type biocontrol 
strain.
In another study, it was observed that saprophytic (non-pathogenic) P. syringae 
completely protected pears against both gray mold and blue mold disease caused 
by Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum, respectively. However, because this 
protective effect depended on applying an extremely high inoculum of the bio-
control agent compared to the phytopathogen, the use of this bacterium to combat 
these fungal diseases is impractical.
It has been shown that some biocontrol agents can outcompete the fungal 
pathogen Pythium ultimum, on sugar beets in soil, for the ability to proliferate on 
plant roots by metabolizing the constituents of the seed and root exudates. Some 
of the biocontrol PGPB subsequently produce compounds that are inhibitory to 
P. ultimum.
One approach to developing biocontrol strains includes using non-pathogenic 
variants of a phytopathogenic organism that can compete with the pathogen for the 
same ecological niche. This was done with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas 
euvesicatoria, one of the causative agents of black spot disease on plant leaves 
(Fig. 5.9). In this case, the competitive (biocontrol) bacterium was an attenuated

bacteriocin producer of Xanthomonas perforans. Bacteriocins are substances 
­(peptide antibiotics) released by some bacteria that kill other bacteria. While the  
X. perforans strain was effective at limiting the damage caused by X. ­euvesicatoria, 
it showed its greatest effectiveness on the leaf surface, with less of an effect 
observed inside of the leaf. This suggests that competition is the major mechanism 
of suppression and the bacteriocin merely enhances the competition since competi-
tion is known to be less effective inside the leaf.
In one recent experiment, researchers began with the bacterium 
Pseudomonas fluorescens F113rif, a biocontrol PGPB that was originally iso-
lated from the sugar beet rhizosphere. This strain can suppress take-all disease 
caused by Pythium ultimum. The biocontrol ability of this strain is thought 
to be a consequence of several activities that the biocontrol strain possesses 
including the production of siderophores, the antibiotic diacetyl-phloroglu-
cinol, hydrogen cyanide, and an extracellular protease. A triple mutant of this 
biocontrol strain that was affected in the genes kinB, sadB, and wspR (KSW) 
is hypermotile and is more competitive for rhizosphere colonization than the 
wild-type strain. In one set of experiments, the biocontrol activity of the wild-
type strain (F113) was compared with a hypermotile strain derived from strain 
F113 (V35) and the above-mentioned triple-mutant strain (KSW). In competi-
tion experiments, the mutant strains were consistently more effective than the 
wild-type at colonizing plant roots. In addition, the hypermotile mutant strain 
was much more effective than either the hypermotile or wild-type strain in pre-
venting damage to tomato plants by the fungal pathogen Fusarium ­oxysporum 
and to strawberry plants by the fungal pathogen Phytophthora cactorum 
(Fig. 5.10). This result indicates that the ability of a biocontrol PGPB to be an

effective competitor for binding to plant roots can significantly augment other 
biocontrol activities that the bacterium may possess. Moreover, while hyper-
motility of a biocontrol strain may enhance the effectiveness of a biocontrol 
strain to a limited extent, the competitiveness of the bacterium in binding to 
plant roots is a more important trait.
To limit root colonization by phytopathogens plants sometimes secrete active 
oxygen species, such as the hydroxyl radical, the superoxide anion, and hydrogen 
peroxide, all of which can inhibit phytopathogen cell processes (Fig. 5.11). Plant 
roots also sometimes respond to colonization by PGPB by producing active oxy-
gen species. Some more effective phytopathogens (that are effective at overcom-
ing the plant’s defenses) contain elevated levels of enzymes such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase that can reduce the amount of active oxygen 
species. Similarly, it is possible by genetic manipulation of biocontrol PGPB, to 
increase the levels of one or more of the enzymes that reduce the amount of active 
oxygen species. This genetic manipulation results in the biocontrol PGPB being 
more effective at colonizing plant roots (i.e., more competitive) and more persis-
tent in the rhizosphere with the result that these biocontrol PGPB are more effec-
tive antifungal pathogen agents.
In the soil, bacteria and fungi often compete with one another to occupy favora-
ble ecological niches such as plant rhizospheres. To outcompete other similar 
bacteria, some soil bacteria synthesize antimicrobial compounds called bacteri-
ocins, ribosomally encoded peptides that typically are active against species that 
are closely related to the producer strain. In one recent study, scientists identi-
fied, purified, and characterized a 14-kDa bacteriocin (CmmAMP-1) synthesized 
by the tomato plant pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis. 
The researchers subsequently showed that both the bacteriocin-producing patho-
gen and the purified bacteriocin were highly active at inhibiting the growth of the 
related pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus which is the cause 
of bacterial ring rot of potato (Fig. 5.12). [Tomato and potato both belong to an 
extremely diverse and large plant family, the Solanaceae.] Following the isola-
tion of the gene for this bacteriocin, the recombinant protein was produced and 
found to be highly active at a very low concentration, with 50 % growth inhibi-
tion (IC50) of ~10 pmol, but was not toxic to potato leaves or tubers. This demon-
stration opens up the possibility of identifying and characterizing a whole class of 
narrow inhibitory spectrum bacteriocins, each of which is synthesized by a spe-
cific bacterium as part of its effort to outcompete similar bacteria in its immediate 
environment.

5.7  Volatile Compounds
In a limited number of instances, biocontrol microorganisms that produce vola-
tile compounds that are toxic to a variety of pathogens have been identified. The 
best example of this mechanism is the plant growth-promoting endophytic fungus 
called Muscodor albus. This plant-dwelling fungus was first discovered, in the 
late 1990s, in the bark of a cinnamon tree in a rain forest in Honduras. M. albus 
is a highly effective antipathogenic agent against a wide range of pathogenic 
fungi and bacteria including, but not limited to, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium 
­ultimum, Pythium aphanadermatum, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium aveneaceum, 
Phytophthora capsici, Phytophthora palmivora, Sclerotinia minor, and Sclerotinia 
rolfsii. In addition, M. albus can also act as an insecticide and nematocide.
Interestingly, Muscodor albus and other Muscodor species (found in various 
tropical forests around the world) do not have to come into contact with a patho-
genic agent in order to inhibit or kill it. This is because Muscodor spp. synthesizes 
a large number of different volatile organic compounds that are lethal to a wide 
range of bacteria and fungi. These volatile organic compounds include (among 
others) acetone, ethyl propionate, ethyl isobutyrate, methyl 2-methylbutyrate, 
ethanol, ethyl butyrate, isobutyl alcohol, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-bu-
tanol, isobutyric acid, octane, and phenethyl alcohol. It should be pointed out that 
researchers have been able to duplicate some, but not all, of the antiphytopath-
ogenic effects observed with M. albus using mixtures of the above-mentioned 
organic compounds.
Unlike other biocontrol agents, Muscodor cannot readily be used in the field. 
However, it may be used as a fumigant in a greenhouse, or in a warehouse of har-
vested fruit. M. albus is also being developed for fumigation of greenhouse soil 
to control diseases that attack plant roots, postharvest disease control of fruit, nut, 
vegetable, seed, and bulbs; insect control; preplant fumigation of tomatoes, pep-
pers, strawberries, nursery, and other crops; replant disease of nut trees, stone fruit

trees and vines; and greenhouse soil diseases. Notwithstanding its suggested use as a 
fumigant, given that Muscodor was originally isolated as a tree endophyte, it is pos-
sible that some strains of Muscodor can be directly inoculated into agricultural and 
forest species in order to provide protection against invading pests and pathogens.
To utilize M. albus effectively, it has been necessary to develop a unique 
method of delivery for this biocontrol agent. Thus, a formulation of M. albus con-
sists of desiccated rye grain colonized by the fungus. The delivery system includes 
a packet or sachet of the desiccated grain that has to be activated for postharvest 
use by rehydration (i.e., the addition of water). Once rehydration has taken place, 
the antipathogen treatment can be applied by simply placing activated M. albus 
sachets within packages (boxes or cartons) of grapes or peaches as is currently 
done with sulfur dioxide generator pads.
In addition to its antifungal activity, M. albus has been found to act as a biocon-
trol agent of the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella, a serious insect pest of 
stored potato as well as of a number of plant parasitic nematodes that, in aggregate, 
cause tens of billions of dollars of economic loss to US agriculture every year.
5.8  Lowering Ethylene
Plants respond to a variety of different stresses including fungal phytopathogen 
infection by synthesizing “stress” ethylene. In turn, the ethylene can trigger a 
stress/senescence response in the plant that may lead to the death of those cells 
that are at or near the site of the fungal infection. Stress ethylene is thought to act 
as a secondary messenger and can (in different tissues in different plants) stimu-
late senescence, leaf or fruit abscission, disease development, inhibition of growth, 
and/or antibiotic enzyme (e.g., chitinase or β-glucanase) synthesis.
The synthesis of stress ethylene in response to phytopathogen infection occurs 
in two phases (Fig. 5.13a). The first (and much smaller) peak of ethylene synthe-
sis occurs very soon after the onset of the fungal infection (i.e., typically within 
a few hours). This short burst of ethylene is synthesized from the plant’s pool of 
preexisting 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) and appears to be one of 
the triggers that activate the plant’s synthesis of defensive proteins, a response that 
is designed to limit the proliferation of the fungal pathogen within the plant. The 
second (and much larger) peak of ethylene synthesis usually occurs several days 
after the initial fungal phytopathogen infection. This ethylene peak is dependent 
upon newly synthesized ACC subsequent to the initial infection. It is believed that 
it is this second peak of ethylene synthesis that contributes to a large portion of the 
damage to a plant that follows fungal phytopathogen infection.
Many of the disease symptoms of a plant that is infected with a fungal phytopath-
ogen may arise as a direct result of the stress that is imposed by the infection. That 
is, a significant portion of the damage to plants infected with fungal phytopathogens 
occurs as a result of the response of the plant to the increased level of stress ethyl-
ene that forms in response to the infection rather than as a consequence of the direct 

141
action of the pathogen itself. In this regard, it has been observed in laboratory exper-
iments that the presence of exogenous ethylene generally increases the severity of 
a phytopathogenic fungal infection, and, conversely, inhibitors of ethylene synthe-
sis usually significantly decrease the severity of a fungal infection. Thus for exam-
ple, the addition of exogenous ethylene has been found to increase disease severity 
in tomato plants infected with Verticillium wilt. On the other hand, cotton plants 
that were treated with L-α-(aminoethoxyvinyl)-glycine, (AVG), an inhibitor of the 
enzyme ACC synthase and an analog of the naturally occurring ethylene inhibitor 
rhizobitoxine, were much less damaged by the fungal phytopathogen Alternaria than 
were plants not treated with any ethylene inhibitors. There is little question of the 
laboratory effectiveness of adding chemical ethylene inhibitors in terms of their abil-
ity to reduce pathogen-associated plant damage. However, as a consequence of both 
the high cost and the potential environmental contamination, the use of chemical 
ethylene inhibitors on a large scale in the field is impractical.
The enzyme ACC deaminase, when present in PGPB, modulates the level of 
ethylene in plants (Fig. 5.13b). The functioning of this enzyme is part of a mecha-
nism that is widespread in PGPB to directly stimulate plant growth. ACC deami-
nase lowers the level of ethylene in both developing and stressed plants. In the 
absence of ACC deaminase, pathogen-induced stress ethylene is produced in most 
plants following pathogen infection. The stress ethylene mediates and exacerbates 
some of the manifestations of the damage to plants caused by the pathogen. On the 
other hand, ACC deaminase-containing biocontrol PGPB act to modulate the level 
of stress ethylene in a plant and thereby prevent or at least decrease the damage 
normally caused by phytopathogens.

5.8  Lowering Ethylene

142
5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
There are numerous examples of the presence of ACC deaminase being respon-
sible for the biocontrol activity of various PGPB. For a start, it has been shown 
that ACC deaminase decreases the damage to cucumber plants infected with 
Pythium ultimum (Table 5.1). Strain P. fluorescens CHA0 is an antibiotic-produc-
ing biocontrol PGPB that limits the severity of the damage to cucumber plants 
caused by the fungal pathogen Pythium ultimum. When strain CHA0 is genetically 
transformed so that it expresses ACC deaminase activity, the damage to cucum-
ber plants is reduced even further (i.e., the two activities act synergistically). 
Moreover, strain P. putida UW4, which does not synthesize any antibiotics and 
does not have any other biocontrol activity, protects cucumber plants to a signifi-
cant extent against the inhibitory effects of the fungal pathogen. This result is con-
sistent with the lowering of stress ethylene by the bacterial ACC deaminase.
Strains CHA0 and CHA0/ACC-D were also used to protect potato slices against 
damage by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora (Table 5.2). In this case, the bio-
control PGPB strain CHA0 did not significantly affect the extent of damage to pota-
toes due to the bacterial pathogen. However, the CHA0 transformant that expresses 
ACC deaminase lowers the level of stress ethylene and also decreases the damage to 
the potatoes by approximately 50 %. In this experiment, the antibiotic synthesized by 
strain CHA0 was ineffective against the bacterial pathogen. Despite the “failure” of 
one biocontrol mechanism (i.e., antibiotic production), lowering the level of stress eth-
ylene significantly protected the potatoes against damage by the bacterial pathogen.

The bacterial genus Agrobacterium includes several related strains that are the 
causative agents of crown gall and hairy root disease that affects a wide range of 
dicotyledonous, as well as some monocotyledonous, plants. For example, strains 
of Agrobacterium vitis are the predominant cause of crown gall tumors of grape 
in various grape-growing regions worldwide. Moreover, the galls that are induced 
by Agrobacterium infection produce very high levels of ethylene. This observa-
tion is consistent with the possibility that ethylene may facilitate or at least exacer-
bate crown gall development. Based on this logic, one may predict that by limiting 
ethylene production in Agrobacterium-infected plants, it should be possible to 
significantly decrease the damage to those plants that occur as a consequence of 
Agrobacterium infection. In fact, researchers in two separate laboratories have 
demonstrated that ACC deaminase-containing PGPB can significantly lower both 
plant ethylene levels and the size of crown gall tumors in Agrobacterium-infected 
plants (Fig. 5.14). In addition, PGPB in which the ACC deaminase gene has been 
either interrupted or deleted are no longer able to lower ethylene levels or prevent 
the growth of crown gall tumors.

5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
Pine wilt disease is one of the major threats affecting conifer forests world-
wide. This disease is caused by the pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylo-
philus, including pinewood nematode-associated bacteria and an insect vector, 
Monochamus spp., which is responsible for the pinewood nematode tree-to-tree 
dissemination. In Europe, pine wilt disease was first reported in 1999; however, 
some scientists believe that this disease may become one of the most common dis-
eases threatening European conifer forests in the near future. At the present time, 
there are no effective means of preventing this disease. Nevertheless, based on 
the observation that ethylene production increases in pine trees during pinewood 
nematode invasion, increased ethylene levels may be, at least partially, responsible 
for the development of pine wilt disease symptoms. One possible way of limit-
ing the damage caused by the pinewood nematode is the inoculation of pine trees 
with ACC deaminase-containing PGPB. In fact, the PGPB P. putida UW4 not only 
induced pine tree seedling growth, in the presence of the pinewood nematode, but 
it also reduced disease symptoms caused by the nematode (Fig. 5.15). Moreover, 
an ACC deaminase minus mutant of P. putida UW4 neither promoted plant

growth nor prevented pine wilt disease, thereby confirming the key role played 
by ACC deaminase in the biocontrol of this phytopathogenic nematode. A prob-
lem that exists with this approach is that despite the fact that lowering plant eth-
ylene decreases the damage from the pinewood nematode, it does not prevent the 
nematode from infecting the plant. Thus, this treatment only partially addresses 
the problem. It is nevertheless very encouraging that a biocontrol strategy that 
prevents the anticipated widespread damage from the pinewood nematode can be 
developed. However, it remains to be determined whether (i) an ACC deaminase-
containing PGPB that is endophytic is superior to P. putida UW4, a rhizospheric 
PGPB, and (ii) a bacterium that acts as a nematocide might work synergistically 
with an ACC deaminase-containing PGPB.
5.9  Systemic Resistance
In many plants, long-lasting and broad-spectrum systemic resistance to a variety of 
disease-causing agents including fungal and bacterial pathogens can be induced by 
treating the plant with either PGPB or with the pathogen itself (Fig. 5.16). Systemic 
Fig. 5.16   Schematic overview of ISR and SAR
5.8  Lowering Ethylene

146
5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
resistance that is induced by the pathogen itself is called systemic acquired resist-
ance (SAR) while the resistance induced by a PGPB is called induced systemic 
resistance (ISR). SAR is typically characterized by the coordinate activation of the 
expression of a set of “pathogenesis-related” (PR) genes that encode proteins with 
antimicrobial activity. In some reports, ISR has been associated with enhancement 
of lignification and increases in peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity within 
the treated plant. In addition, several bacterial molecules have been implicated as 
signals for the induction of systemic resistance including the O-antigenic side chain 
of the bacterial outer membrane protein lipopolysaccharide, bacterial siderophores 
and, in some instances, salicylic acid. Both ethylene and jasmonic acid have been 
implicated in the ISR response; however, the evidence for this involvement is a bit 
circumstantial. That is, plant mutants that are defective in aspects of jasmonate or 
ethylene signaling do not develop ISR. Thus, it has been suggested that ISR is based 
on increased sensitivity and not increased production of these hormones.
Most studies of systemic resistance have been carried out using fungal patho-
gens; however, this approach is also useful in the control of bacterial diseases. In 
one study, inoculation with two PGPB strains (P. putida and Serratia marcescens) 
protected cucumber plants against the pathogen P. syringae pv. lachrymans, the 
causal agent of bacterial angular leaf spot. Treatment of seeds or cotyledons was 
found to result in a significant decrease in both lesion number and size, and in the 
leaf population of the pathogen. Importantly, PGPB have been shown to induce 
systemic resistance in the field as well as in laboratory and greenhouse conditions.
At the present time, a thorough and detailed knowledge of ISR and SAR is 
still very much incomplete so that it is not always possible, a priori, to predict the 
response of a plant to a particular PGPB strain. For example, one strain of P. fluo-
rescens was effective in inducing systemic resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana but 
not in radish, protecting the plant against both a fungal (Fusarium oxysporum) and 
a bacterial (P. syringae pv. tomato) phytopathogen. Another P. fluorescens strain 
ISR is in radish but not in Arabidopsis. This suggests that different biocontrol bac-
teria are “differentially” active in eliciting ISR in related plant species.
5.9.1  Effects on Plant Gene Expression
A number of strains of filamentous fungi from the genus Trichoderma are used 
as biocontrol agents in agriculture. The biocontrol mechanisms that are used by 
these organisms include the production of antibiotics and/or hydrolytic enzymes, 
competition for nutrients and the fungal stimulation of plant defense responses 
including both ISR and SAR. Root colonization by Trichoderma triggers a sys-
temic response mediated by jasmonic acid and ethylene in a manner similar to that 
described for ISR induced by PGPB (Fig. 5.16). Interestingly, systemic defenses 
induced by Trichoderma may also be mediated by salicylic acid (similar to SAR). 
In the latter case, the defense response may vary depending on the plant genetic 
background, the interaction time, the strain of Trichoderma, and inoculum size.

147
To better understand how a particular strain of Trichoderma protected tomato 
plants against fungal pathogens, one group of researchers used real-time PCR to 
monitor the expression of plant genes involved in ISR and SAR following the 
interaction of the plant with Trichoderma. To do this, they incubated plant seed-
lings for six days with Trichoderma and compared the response of those plants 
with untreated control plants. Treated plants had significantly increased expression 
levels of ethylene signaling and lipoxygenase genes (part of the jasmonate and 
ethylene signaling pathways), while the salicylic acid-responsive PR gene expres-
sion level was reduced, and salicylic acid biosynthesis gene expression was not 
affected. These results indicate that the Trichoderma inoculation stimulated an ISR 
but not an SAR response.
Using real-time PCR to assess which genes are up-regulated and which are 
down-regulated presupposes that we know which genes may alter their expression 
in response to either pathogens or growth-promoting bacteria or fungi. However, 
it is entirely possible that more than a few plant genes (and possibly even hun-
dreds) will exhibit altered expression levels as a consequence of interacting with 
either pathogens or growth-promoting bacteria or fungi. Thus, to better understand 
the detailed nature of how the plant is responding, it is necessary to monitor the 
expression of hundreds to thousands of plant proteins or mRNAs using the tech-
niques of proteomics or transcriptomics, respectively.
5.10  Bacteriophages
In some parts of the world, sprays of either antibiotics (typically either tetracycline 
or streptomycin) or copper are used to minimize the damage to crops from bacte-
rial pathogens. However, there are serious problems with both of these approaches. 
The continued use of antibiotics can result in the development of antibiotic resist-
ant pathogens and the subsequent spread of the resistance genes to other bacteria 
in the environment. The long-term use of copper sprays can lead to the accumu-
lation of toxic levels of copper in the environment. Therefore, in some countries 
workers have sought to replace the use of antibiotics and copper sprays with bacte-
riophages, viruses that infect bacteria.
On a practical level, it is important to isolate diverse bacteriophages from a 
wide range of host bacterial strains that represent the diversity of the pathogens 
involved in the targeted disease. It is also suggested, when isolating new bacte-
riophages that, when they are tested under laboratory conditions, strains that pro-
duce clear plaques should always be selected, as this will decrease the possibility 
of selecting lysogenic bacteriophages that do not (completely) lyse their bacte-
rial hosts but rather are somewhat prone to undergo a lysogenic cycle (Fig. 5.17). 
While the host range of most bacteriophages is usually quite narrow, with new 
isolates this needs to be tested directly to be sure that the selected bacteriophage 
lyses only the target pathogen and does not affect any bacterial strains that facili-
tate plant growth. Ideally, bacteriophage should be delivered to the plant as a

148
5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
cocktail of different bacteriophage strains all directed against the targeted bac-
terial pathogen. The use of a cocktail of bacteriophages makes it less likely that 
bacteriophage-resistant mutants of the targeted pathogen will develop since each 
of the different bacteriophages will likely bind to a different site on the bacterial 
surface. It is also important, prior to their widespread use, for the DNA sequences 
of the selected bacteriophages to be completely determined so that they can be 
accurately tracked in the environment. When testing biocontrol bacteriophages in 
the field, the presence of other microbes, including other pathogens, may influ-
ence the effectiveness of the bacteriophages. In addition, prior to treating affected 
plants, it is essential to ascertain precisely which organism caused the disease 
symptoms since in some cases pathogens of a different genus or species can cause

very similar disease symptoms but will not be killed by the bacteriophage cocktail 
that has been developed.
In the field, as a consequence of the UV light sensitivity of most bacterio-
phages, the application of this biocontrol agent is often done at dusk when the UV 
intensity is low. This results in an increase in bacteriophage environmental longev-
ity and effectiveness. Even so, some bacteriophages need to be applied weekly, or 
even daily, to be effective. In addition to there being some problems with bacte-
riophage stability in the field, it has sometimes been observed that following the 
rapid lysis of a very large portion of the population of a bacterial pathogen, a small 
number of bacteriophage-resistant cells sometimes remain. If these resistant cells, 
admittedly a very small number, are able to proliferate, then resistant bacteria will 
predominate at the next generation, ultimately negating the effectiveness of this 
approach. Whether this scenario occurs in the field as well as in the laboratory is 
not known at the present time.
At present (2014), several bacteriophage-based biocontrol agents have been 
licensed for use. For example, there are a range of bacteriophage products for the 
control of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria which 
causes bacterial spot of tomatoes and peppers, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. 
tomato, which is the causative agent of bacterial speck on tomatoes.
5.11  Quorum Sensing and Quorum Quenching
In the environment, using the mechanism of quorum sensing, bacterial cells 
are able to sense the presence of other similar, as well as different, organisms. 
Quorum sensing is a form of intercellular communication that is used by many 
different species of bacteria in the environment. Once bacterial cell densities attain 
a certain critical level, quorum sensing enables bacteria to switch on different sets 
of genes, thereby facilitating concerted interactions between the cells, enabling 
groups of bacteria to act in a coordinate manner.
Most quorum sensing systems behave similarly. Initially, low molecular weight 
molecules called autoinducers are synthesized inside of bacterial cells. Some of 
these molecules are eventually released outside of the cells. When the number of 
bacterial cells in a population increases, the extracellular concentration of these 
autoinducers also increases. When the extracellular concentration of autoinducers 
exceeds some threshold level, the autoinducers bind to a cellular receptor and trig-
ger a signal transduction cascade that causes population-wide changes in bacterial 
gene expression, thereby enabling a group of cells to act in unison, e.g., as a plant 
pathogen (Fig. 5.18). While there are a number of different classes of molecules 
that can act as autoinducers, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are a major class 
of autoinducer signals used by gram-negative proteobacteria for quorum sensing 
(Fig. 5.19).
Among other activities, quorum sensing facilitates the formation of bacte-
rial biofilms, bacterial communities that develop within an extracellular matrix of 
5.10  Bacteriophages

5  Biocontrol Mechanisms
polysaccharides produced by the bacteria. This facilitates bacterial survival in the 
somewhat hostile soil environment as biofilms protect bacteria against desiccation, 
UV radiation, predation, and antibiosis. Moreover, quorum sensing (leading to 
biofilm formation) is commonly employed by both phytopathogens and rhizobia. 
Thus, quorum sensing is often a key component of the interaction of phytopatho-
gens and rhizobia with plant roots.
The ability to disrupt quorum sensing networks is termed quorum quenching, and 
it is one way in which one bacterial species in the environment may gain an advan-
tage over another. This may be particularly useful for facilitating crop growth if the 
quorum quenching system is part of a plant growth-promoting bacterium, while the 
Fig. 5.18   A generalized overview of the process of quorum sensing. Autoinducers are molecules 
synthesized inside a bacterium (by a varying number of steps depending upon the particular mol-
ecule) before being transported (passively or actively) outside of the cell. When the external con-
centration of autoinducer molecules reaches a threshold value, the autoinducers are transported into 
cells where, as a consequence of a signal transduction cascade, they activate the transcription of one 
or more target genes. P and P1 indicate different bacterial promoters. When the autoinducer mole-
cule has an acyl homoserine lactone structure (see Fig. 5.19), homologs of the long-chain fatty acid 
transporter system, which facilitate uptake of long-chain fatty acids, may act as a receptor protein

length with occasional side chain modifications at the C3 position

151
quorum sensing network is part of a bacterial phytopathogen. Quorum quenching can 
be achieved by several different approaches, including inhibition or inactivation of 
AHL production (Fig. 5.20). This occurs when a biocontrol bacterium that produces 
the enzyme lactonase (or a bacteriophage that has been engineered to produce lacto-
nase) degrades some of the AHLs molecules. Some lactonases degrade only one or two 
specific AHLs, while others have a much broader specificity. Degradation of the AHLs 
disrupts quorum sensing and ultimately decreases the phytopathogenicity of the phy-
topathogen. In addition, one group of scientists found that volatile organic compounds 
synthesized by two different strains of rhizospheric PGPB, P. fluorescens and Serratia 
plymuthica, were responsible for decreasing the amount of AHLs produced by vari-
ous phytopathogens, thereby thwarting the ability of these strains to act as pathogens. 
Thus, quorum quenching may be viewed as yet another tool in the arsenal that may be 
employed in an effort to limit the damage to crop plants from various phytopathogens.
Finally, it is interesting to note that in a number of instances scientists have found 
that some quorum quenching biocontrol bacteria may also be active in quorum sens-
ing. That is, the AHL degrading enzymes produced by these bacteria do not degrade the 
AHLs that they themselves produce. This helps these bacteria to better establish their 
own niche on the plant surface and potentially to be more effective biocontrol agents.
Fig. 5.20   A schematic overview of quorum quenching. A biocontrol bacterium that produces the 
enzyme lactonase takes up and degrades some of the acyl homoserine lactone molecules (AHLs), 
thereby decreasing the formation of quorum sensing, and ultimately phytopathogenicity, by the 
phytopathogen

5.12  Nematodes and Endophytes
The nematode Radopholus similis (commonly known as the burrowing nematode) is 
a pest of a variety of agricultural crops, most notably banana and citrus. This nema-
tode can severely damage the plant roots, thereby reducing the ability of the tree to 
take up water and nutrients. As a consequence, R. similis is considered to be a major 
root pathogen of banana trees and has been reported to cause yield losses of from 
30 to 60 %. These nematodes may be controlled by chemical fumigation of the soil 
and by ensuring that new sprouts are raised from clean tissue culture. In an effort to 
avoid the use of chemical fumigation, scientists have observed that some endophytic

damage tree roots resulting in a decreased yield of both biomass and fruit. b In the presence of 
certain fungal endophytes together with bacterial endophytes, nematode damage to plants may be 
dramatically decreased and plant and fruit yield is not appreciably affected

153
fungi and some endophytic bacteria are able to partially limit the damage to the plant 
caused by this nematode. Moreover, when several different endophytic fungi in com-
bination with several different endophytic bacteria were tested (one bacterium and 
one fungus at a time) for biocontrol activity against R. similis, it was observed that, 
with some combinations of fungi and bacteria, up to a 90 % reduction in damage to 
plant roots was observed (Fig. 5.21). In addition to provide biocontrol, the successful 
fungal−bacterial combinations also promoted plant growth from 20 to 50 %. While 
these observations are important and may provide the basis for the development of 
biological alternatives to chemical fumigation, scientists have not as yet developed 
an understanding of the mechanistic basis for this biocontrol behavior.

6.1  Overview of Stresses
For the most part, plants that are grown in the field under natural conditions are 
subject to a more or less constant onslaught of one stress after another, all of which 
can potentially inhibit plant growth and development (Fig.  6.1). These stresses 
may be caused by biotic factors such as viruses, nematodes, insects, bacteria, or 
fungi. Alternatively, abiotic factors such as extremes of temperature, high light, 
flooding, drought, the presence of toxic metals and environmental organic con-
taminants, and radiation. It is worth noting that wounding can also be inhibitory to 
plant growth and development. While different plants may respond differently to 
different stresses, e.g., some plants are much more sensitive to increasing levels of 
salt, nearly all plants respond to stress by producing ethylene (Fig. 5.13). As dis-
cussed in Chap. 5, when considering the synthesis of stress ethylene in response to 
fungal pathogen infection, abiotic stresses also induce the synthesis of two peaks 
of ethylene. Moreover, as documented for biotic stresses, lowering the second 
(larger) ethylene peak can significantly decrease the severity of the negative con-
sequences of the stress. Ideally, it would seem to be advantageous for a plant to 
synthesize the first (smaller, defensive) ethylene peak but not the second (senes-
cence-causing) ethylene peak. In fact, this is readily achieved when plants are 
treated with PGPB that produce the enzyme ACC deaminase. This occurs because 
these bacteria contain a low, but constitutive, level of ACC deaminase that does 
not significantly alter the magnitude of the first ethylene peak. However, between 
the first and second ethylene peaks, as additional ACC is synthesized, the increas-
ing level of ACC induces the synthesis of more ACC deaminase which results in a 
lowering of the level of ACC and hence a lowering of the second peak of ethylene 
(see Figs. 3.20 and 5.13).
It is worth pointing out that while ethylene signaling is required for induced 
systemic resistance in plants elicited by PGPB, high level of ethylene is not

required for this to occur. Thus, lowering of plant ethylene levels by bacterial ACC 
deaminase is not incompatible with induced systemic resistance. In fact, some 
PGPB strains that possess ACC deaminase also induce systemic resistance.
6.2  Salt and Drought
Soil salinity is an enormous worldwide problem for agriculture, especially for crops 
that are grown under irrigation. This is because salt is inhibitory to the growth of a 
large number of different plants. At the present time, the amount of salt-inhibited 
land worldwide is estimated to be >900 million ha which is approximately 6 % of 
the total global landmass, or about 20 % of the world’s cultivated area. Disturbingly, 
around half of the world’s land that is devoted to the growth of irrigated crops is 
adversely affected by salt. Soil salinity is caused by inefficient irrigation and drain-
age systems. Some areas are under-irrigated causing salts to accumulate. The salt 
remains behind in the soil when water is taken up by plants or lost to evaporation.
More than one-third of worldwide corn production is in the USA. Until very 
recently, the corn yield per acre of land has continued to increase. This likely 
reflects the fact that an increasing number of corn plants are planted per acre of 
land. An unfortunate consequence of this strategy is that a decreasing amount of 
soil water is available to each plant. In practice, this means that corn plants are 
becoming increasingly sensitive to drought.
The initial responses of plants to drought and salinity are very similar; both are 
attributed to water stress. When plants are exposed to high salinity, a decrease in 
the growth rate followed by a gradual recovery to a new reduced growth rate is the 
plant’s first response to the decrease in water potential caused by salt, rather than

to any salt-specific toxicity. Once it has been taken up, sodium ions may be trans-
located to shoots in the transpiration stream in the xylem. Although sodium ions 
have the ability to return to roots via the phloem, this flow is generally minimal so 
that leaves and shoots typically accumulate higher concentrations of sodium ions 
than roots. In addition, most crops translocate only a limited amount of sodium 
ions to reproductive or storage structures such as fruits and seeds as these organs 
are fed mainly through the phloem. However, vegetative tissues are supplied 
mainly by the flow through the xylem and, as a result, have higher sodium ion 
levels. The metabolic toxicity of sodium ions is primarily attributed to these ions 
competing with potassium ions for binding sites essential for cellular functioning.
Plants utilize a variety of different biochemical strategies to cope with salt stress 
including (i) selective accumulation or exclusion of sodium ions, (ii) control of 
sodium ion uptake by roots and transport into leaves, (iii) compartmentalization of 
sodium ions at the cellular and whole-plant levels, (iv) synthesis of compatible sol-
utes such as trehalose or proline, (v) alteration of membrane structure, (vi) induc-
tion of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, and 
(vii) modulation of plant hormone levels including auxin, cytokinin, and ethylene. 
However, it is important to bear in mind that the salt tolerance of any particular plant 
species can vary with the growth phase of the plant, the ionic composition of the 
soil, the health of the plant, and the presence of rhizospheric or endophytic PGPB.
When considering the various mechanisms that PGPB utilize, it is important 
to keep in mind that many of these mechanisms are interconnected and affect one 
another. In addition to providing direct protection against the inhibitory effects 
of abiotic stress (e.g., by stimulating plant growth with bacterial IAA or lower-
ing plant ethylene levels as a consequence of the functioning of ACC deaminase), 
PGPB may alter plant gene expression so that the plant is less likely to succumb 
to the abiotic stress. For example, interaction with various PGPB has been shown 
to increase the plant production of the metabolites betaine, proline, and trehalose 
as well as the synthesis of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase that 
can detoxify reactive oxygen species.
In the examples given below, conferring salt tolerance upon plants can often be 
attributed to one or more specific PGPB mechanisms. However, the literature also 
contains a number of reports where the mechanism(s) employed by a PGPB strain 
in conferring salt tolerance to a plant is completely unknown. While these bacte-
rial strains may be useful, they do not provide researchers with any guidelines for 
selecting additional PGPB that are able to confer salt tolerance to treated plants.
6.2.1  IAA
In one study, it was shown that incubation of two different cultivars of corn with 
the IAA-producing  PGPB Azospirillum brasilense or A. lipoferum enabled the 
plants to tolerate high levels of salt in the soil (Table 6.1). The Azospirillum stimu-
lated the activity of both nitrate reductase and nitrogenase in the plant, partially

reversing the inhibitory effects of the added salt. While the Azospirillum-treated 
plants grew to a significantly greater extent at all of the salt concentrations tested 
and in all of the parameters measured, this study did not definitively identify the 
mechanism(s) of plant growth promotion under high salt conditions. In addition to 
the data shown in Table 6.1, in the absence of any added bacterium, the shoot and 
root content of proline increased significantly along with the increasing level of 
salt as the plant attempted to compensate for the added osmotic stress. However, 
in the presence of Azospirillum, the rise in proline content was less dramatic, pre-
sumably reflecting the lower level of osmotic stress in PGPB-treated plants.
In an effort to create a PGPB strain that would be more effective at protecting 
plants against inhibition by high salt, one group of scientists engineered a strain of 
Sinorhizobium meliloti with an additional pathway for IAA biosynthesis. This was 
done by expressing the iaaM gene from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas savas-
tanoi on a plasmid in a strain of S. meliloti (Fig. 6.2). In this study, when the trans-
formed S. meliloti strain was used to nodulate Medicago truncatula plants, the 
resultant plants were more resistant to the inhibitory effects of high salt as well as 
to several other stresses. However, since the increased IAA concentration induced 
plants to synthesize a higher level of trehalose (which is known to protect plants 
against osmotic stress), it is not clear whether the increase in plant stress resistance 
is a direct or indirect effect of the increased level of IAA.
In another set of experiments, the medicinal plant Silybum marianum (milk 
thistle) was inoculated with the root-colonizing bacterium Pseudomonas extrem-
orientalis and then grown in the presence of varying concentrations of salt. 
Increasing the salt concentration from 0 to 100  mM significantly decreased the 
plant’s root length and shoot length and fresh weight in the absence of the bac-
terium; however, root length and shoot length (Fig. 6.3), as well as fresh weight, 
were increased in the presence of the bacterium. In addition, in this experiment, 
concentration of IAA between 0.1 and 0.001 μM stimulated plant growth, in both

the presence and absence of salt, to approximately the same extent as adding the 
bacterium. Since this bacterium does not produce ACC deaminase (see below), it 
was assumed that the tolerance to salt stress was a consequence of bacterially syn-
thesized IAA.
6.2.2  Ethylene
Based on the model depicted in Fig. 3.18, it was predicted that any PGPB that 
produced the enzyme ACC deaminase would effectively lower the level of 
stress ethylene experienced by a plant and therefore decrease the damage to the 
plant as a consequence of the applied stress, including the presence of high salt. 
Furthermore, it was reasoned that PGPB isolated from hot, dry, and salty environ-
ments would themselves be salt and desiccation tolerant and be ideal candidates 
for protecting plants from salt and desiccation stress. Therefore, a salt-tolerant 
PGPB (isolated from the rhizosphere of plants growing in the Negev desert) that 
expressed ACC deaminase was tested for its ability to promote the growth of 
tomato plants at increasing levels of salt (Fig. 6.4). Not only did the bacterium 
decrease the production of ethylene by salt-treated tomato plants (to about 25 % of 
the level in the absence of the bacterium), but it also significantly increased tomato 
plant biomass production. Subsequently, several additional laboratories in several 
different countries around the world have performed successful variations of this 
experiment using different PGPB strains and different plants. This demonstrates 
that using PGPB to lower plant ethylene levels is an effective strategy to pro-
tect the plant against the salt caused inhibition of plant growth and development. 
Moreover, in addition to promoting salt tolerance under laboratory conditions,

165
PGPB that produce ACC deaminase are also effective at promoting plant growth in 
the presence of salt in the field (Table 6.2).
ACC deaminase-producing bacteria are not limited to lowering plant growth 
inhibitory levels of ethylene. They have also been reported to increase the extent 
of seed germination, especially in the presence of high levels of salt. In one set of 
experiments, a number of endophytic PGPB strains that were previously isolated 
from within the tissues of the halophytic plant Limonium sinense (used in tradi-
tional Chinese medicine for the treatment of fever, hemorrhage, and other disor-
ders) were tested for their effect on seed germination as well as plant growth. Of the 
126 strains that were isolated, the behavior of four strains was examined in detail. 
The fours strains that were tested all produced ACC deaminase, synthesized IAA, 
and siderophores and were able to solubilize phosphate. While it was never demon-
strated directly in this series of experiments, it was tacitly assumed that the key ele-
ment in promoting germination and plant growth in the presence of high levels of 
salt was the presence of ACC deaminase. Regardless of how much of the stimula-
tion of germination in the presence of high salt effect is due to the presence of ACC 
deaminase, all four of the endophytic PGPB that were tested significantly improved 
seed germination at the majority of the salt concentrations tested (Table 6.3).
In an effort to improve the growth of mung bean (Vigna radiata) under condi-
tions of environmental stress (including high salt, drought, and high temperature), 
plants were co-inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. and three different PGPB (one

at a time). The PGPB were all selected because of the high level of ACC deaminase 
that they produced as well as their resistance to high temperature, drought, and high 
salt concentrations. The impact of the three different PGPB on plant growth and 
development, under various stress conditions, was assessed. Following the stress, 
plant shoot and root dry weight, nodule dry weight, and nodule number were meas-
ured, and for all three stresses and with all three PGPB, the co-inoculation allevi-
ated the bulk of the inhibition of plant growth that resulted from the stress.
One group of researchers grew tomato plants for three weeks in the green-
house and stopped watering the plants for 7–12 days before watering of plants was 
resumed. Some plants were pre-treated (prior to the imposition of drought condi-
tions) with either Pseudomonas putida GR12-2, PGPB previously isolated in the 
Canadian Arctic, Achromobacter piechaudii ARV8, PGPB that had been isolated 
from the Negev desert in southern Israel, or buffer alone. Both of these PGPB 
strains actively produced both IAA and ACC deaminase. As expected, tomato 
plants treated with strain GR12-2 grew to a much greater size than the control 
plants, while plants treated with strain ARV8 grew to an even larger size that was 
approximately five times the size of the control plants (Fig. 6.5). In this experiment, 
it was also shown that plants exposed to drought in the absence of added bacte-
ria synthesized a higher amount of stress ethylene. From these experiments, it was 
concluded that bacterial ACC deaminase, possibly in concert with bacterial IAA, 
provided tomato plants with a significant level of protection against drought stress.
A number of manuscripts have been published which clearly indicate that bacteria 
that synthesize IAA and/or produce the enzyme ACC deaminase can provide plants 
with a significant level of protection against both drought and salt stress. Based on this 
work, many researchers now take it for granted that for bacteria that synthesize IAA 
and/or produce the enzyme ACC deaminase, the mechanism of drought or salt protec-
tion has already been established and it is no longer necessary for them to generate

growing in the Negev desert). Both bacterial strains actively produce the enzyme ACC deaminase

IAA or ACC deaminase minus mutants in order to prove the involvement of these 
mechanisms. Notwithstanding the fact that several other mechanisms may be involved 
in protecting plants against drought or salt inhibition, many workers are currently 
emphasizing the role of IAA and ethylene in drought and salt tolerance. In fact, the 
many reports of plants being protected from drought stress by ACC deaminase include 
tomato, canola, pea, cotton, rice, groundnut, and maize.
6.2.3  Trehalose
Another way in which PGPB can protect plants from osmotic stress such as high 
salt and drought is through the synthesis of osmoprotectants such as proline and 
trehalose. Trehalose is an α,α-1,1-glucoside consisting of two molecules of 
α-glucose (Fig. 6.6). It is thought to form a gel phase (replacing water) as cells 
dehydrate, thereby decreasing the damage to cells from drought and salt. Trehalose 
is a highly stable molecule that is resistant to both acid and high temperature. Salt 
Fig. 6.6   Overview of one of the main pathways for the biosynthesis of trehalose. Here, the syn-
thesis of trehalose-6-phosphate from glucose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose is catalyzed by the 
enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (OtsA) before trehalose-6-phosphate is converted to tre-
halose by the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (OtsB)
6.2  Salt and Drought

168
6  Environmental Interactions
or drought stress dramatically increases the expression of trehalose biosynthetic 
and biodegradative enzymes as well as the level of trehalose itself.
The most common biosynthetic pathway for trehalose is a two-step process in 
which glucose is first transferred from UDP-glucose to glucose-6-phosphate to 
form trehalose-6-phosphate and UDP in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme treha-
lose-6-phosphate synthase encoded by the otsA gene (Fig. 6.6). Then, the trehalose-
6-phosphate is dephosphorylated by the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase 
(encoded by the otsB gene). The first step in this synthesis reaction is rate-limit-
ing; thus, trehalose may be overproduced by first isolating the otsA gene, and then, 
the gene may be introduced into a trehalose-producing bacterium on a multi–copy 
number plasmid. Conversely, the synthesis of trehalose may be inhibited by disrup-
tion, removal, or other inactivation of the otsA gene. When mutants of a strain of 
Rhizobium etli (a bacterium that nodulates bean plants) that both overproduce and 
underproduce trehalose were constructed, it was observed that an increase in treha-
lose caused an increase in the number of nitrogen-fixing nodules per plant, while a 
decrease in trehalose resulted in a decrease in nodule number (Fig. 6.7a). In addi-
tion, the trehalose-overproducing strain had a higher level of nitrogenase activity 
than the wild-type, while the underproducing strain exhibited a decrease in nitroge-
nase activity (Fig. 6.7b). Moreover, higher levels of trehalose had a salutary effect 
on both the survival (Fig. 6.7c) and yield (Fig. 6.7d) of bean plants nodulated by 
these rhizobial strains, especially following periods of imposed drought.
In another series of experiments (Fig.  6.8), A. brasilense transformed with a 
plasmid carrying a trehalose biosynthesis gene fusion (i.e., otsA and otsB) from 
S. cerevisiae grew at 0.5 M NaCl and accumulated trehalose, whereas wild-type 
A. brasilense did not tolerate this level of osmotic stress or accumulate trehalose. 
The reason for making a fusion gene is to insure the optimal synthesis of trehalose 
without having to be concerned about producing too much or too little of one of 
the trehalose biosynthesis proteins. When maize (corn) plants were inoculated with 
the strain of A. brasilense carrying this fusion gene, 85 % of them survived drought 
stress compared to 55 % of plants that survived when they were inoculated with 
the wild-type strain. Moreover, a 73 % increase was observed in the biomass of 
maize plants inoculated with transformed A. brasilense compared with inoculation 
with the wild-type strain. There was also a significant increase of both leaf and root 
length in maize plants inoculated with transformed A. brasilense. Therefore, from 
this experiment, it is possible to conclude that inoculation of maize plants with A. 
brasilense containing higher levels of trehalose confers a greater level of drought 
tolerance and a significant increase in leaf and root biomass.
6.2.4  Cytokinin
Cytokinins are phytohormones that control many of plant’s physiological 
and developmental processes. In addition, it has been known for many years 
that treatment of plants with exogenous cytokinin can dramatically postpone 

169
their senescence. More recently, when scientists transformed plants with the 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens ipt gene (encoding the enzyme isopentenyltransferase) 
fused to various plant promoters, they observed that this was an efficient strategy 
in developing transgenic plants for increased yield by delaying the senescence of 
the whole plant and for protecting plants against drought and salt stress.
Based on the successful experiments with transgenic plants, scientists very 
recently engineered a strain of Sinorhizobium meliloti to overproduce cytokinin 
and then tested the engineered bacteria for the ability to protect alfalfa plants 
against the senescence that results from drought stress. The engineered strains, 
which expressed the Agrobacterium ipt gene under the control of either the E. coli 
lac or trp promoters, synthesized more zeatin (cytokinin) than the control strain 
under free-living conditions. The transformant that expressed the ipt gene under 
the control of the lac promoter produced approximately three times the level of 
cytokinin synthesized by the non-transformed strain, while the transformant that 
included the stronger trp promoter produced nearly five times the level of cyto-
kinin of the non-transformed strain. Following a four-week inoculation period, the

plant yield (normalized to the watered plants treated with the wild-type bacterium) following 
either watering or drought (d)
6.2  Salt and Drought

170
6  Environmental Interactions
effects of the engineered strains on alfalfa growth were similar to those of the con-
trol (non-transformed) strain under non-drought conditions (Fig. 6.9). After being 
subjected to severe drought stress, the alfalfa plants inoculated with the engineered 
strains were significantly larger than the plants inoculated with the non-trans-
formed strain with the strain with the trp promoter providing the greatest benefit to 
plants. When the plants subjected to drought were rewatered, under the conditions 
tested, plants inoculated with the strain with the trp promoter controlling the ipt 
gene grew to a level similar to plants that had not been drought-stressed at all. This 
experiment is a clear demonstration of the ability of engineered rhizobial strains 
synthesizing higher levels of cytokinin to improve the tolerance of alfalfa (and 
possibly other crops) to severe drought stress. Given the reluctance of many regu-
lators to approve the use of genetically engineered bacterial strains in the field, 
it will be interesting to determine whether rhizobial strains producing high cyto-
kinin levels can be either directly selected from environmental samples or altered 
by conventional mutagenesis to perform this function.

6.2.5  Exopolysaccharides
Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are high molecular weight compounds, of a wide range 
of chemical composition, secreted by various microorganisms into the environ-
ment. EPS attached to the outer surface of bacteria are responsible for the ability 
of the bacteria to form biofilms and for the attachment of bacterial cells to sur-
faces including plant roots and soil particles. In one recent study, scientists iso-
lated and characterized 110  PGPB from the rhizosphere of a number of local 
salt-contaminated soils in India (Fig. 6.10). The PGPB strains, all pseudomonads, 
were selected on the basis of the ability to produce high levels of EPS and to be 
salt tolerant. One particular strain, characterized by sequencing its 16S ribosomal 
RNA gene, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was found to be able to grow in up to 12 % 
salt. This bacterium, which also produced IAA and siderophores, was able to facil-
itate plant growth in the presence of (otherwise inhibitory levels of) salt. Chemical 
mutagenesis of the bacterium enabled researchers to select a mutant that produced 
a significantly decreased level of EPS (while the amount of IAA and siderophores 
was unchanged). Concomitant with the decrease in EPS, the mutant lost its abil-
ity to grow and promote plant growth in the presence of high levels of salt. This 
result is interpreted in terms of the EPS limiting the amount of salt that can enter 
the bacterium. With the loss of the EPS barrier, salt readily enters the bacterium 
that is now no longer able to promote plant growth in the presence of salt. These 
researchers believe that the stimulation of plant growth that is observed comes 
from IAA synthesis. However, they failed to assess ACC deaminase activity or the 
presence of bacterially produced cytokinin. Finally, given the fact that P. aerugi-
nosa is a disease-causing bacterium, while this work helps to develop an under-
standing of the role of EPS, this bacterium cannot be used to promote the growth 
of crop plants in the field.

6.3  Flooding and Anoxia
Deprivation of oxygen to the roots of plants is the main negative consequence of 
flooding. Under normal conditions, water dissolves about 230 mmol m−3 oxygen, 
and hypoxia occurs when the oxygen level falls below 50 mmol m−3. Typically, 
shortly after the onset of flooding, soil microorganisms consume all of the avail-
able oxygen (anoxia). Plants subsequently respond to flooding with a wide range of 
physiological changes including adventitious root formation along the submerged 
stem portion, reduction in stem growth, wilting, chlorosis, epinasty, and leaf abscis-
sion. Stressful, low oxygen levels stimulate ACC synthesis via ACC synthase and 
simultaneously arrest ACC oxidation to ethylene (by ACC oxidase) in waterlogged 
plant roots. Stress-induced ACC is synthesized in anoxic plant roots and then trans-
ported in the xylem to the shoots where it is rapidly oxidized to ethylene and sub-
sequently induces epinastic leaf curvature (Fig. 6.11). ACC induces the expression 
of ACC oxidase genes in plant shoots. Despite the increase in ACC from flooded 
roots, ethylene synthesis in shoots of flooded plants is unaffected within the first 
photoperiod following the flooding. The time lag, from the appearance of ACC at

tion and bacterial salt tolerance

173
the stem base until the ethylene burst in the upper leaves (typically around 12 h), 
is a characteristic of flooding stress. This delay might be partly explained by the 
formation of N-malonyl ACC since the N-malonyl ACC level increases in both roots 
and shoots of flooded plants as does the conjugation of ACC to glutamic acid.
The inhibition of plant growth that occurs as a consequence of flooding and 
anoxia may be partially alleviated by first treating the plants with ACC deami-
nase-containing PGPB. In one series of experiments, tomato plants were grown 
for 2 months in a greenhouse with either no added bacteria, one of three differ-
ent ACC deaminase-containing PGPB strains or a mutant of one of the PGPB 
strains that had been engineered to not manufacture ACC deaminase. At the 
end of this growth period, the dry weights of the plants that were treated with 
ACC deaminase-containing PGPB were 10–20 % greater than plants that did not 
come into contact with this enzyme. This small, but significant, effect reflects 
the fact that under good conditions, most PGPB provide only a very small ben-
efit to plants with which they are associated. On the one hand, if tomato plants 
that were 2-month-old were flooded for 9  days, they produced increased lev-
els of ethylene and progressively lost biomass (Fig. 6.12). On the other hand, 
plants that were treated with an ACC deaminase-containing PGPB strain lost

6.3  Flooding and Anoxia

174
6  Environmental Interactions
only a small amount of biomass. Following flooding, the plants that were treated 
with an ACC deaminase-containing PGPB strain had nearly double the chloro-
phyll content of plants that were either not treated with bacteria or treated with 
a PGPB strain that was unable to produce ACC deaminase. In addition, flood-
ing increased the ethylene production by tomato plant petioles by approxi-
mately fivefold to sixfold when the plants were either not treated with bacteria 
or treated with a PGPB strain that was unable to produce ACC deaminase. Plants 
treated with an ACC deaminase-containing strain exhibited a two- to two and a 
half-fold increase in ethylene production. The bottom line is that by lowering 
the production of ethylene that invariably followed flooding, ACC deaminase-
containing PGPB were able to significantly decrease the damage to plants that 
would have otherwise occurred. Importantly, the protection of plants against 
flooding by ACC deaminase-containing PGPB has been shown to be effective 
both in the laboratory and in the field.
6.4  Natural Selection
It has been widely demonstrated in laboratory experiments that many different 
plants exhibit a much higher level of resistance to a wide range of environmen-
tal stresses when those plants have first been inoculated with ACC deaminase-
containing PGPB. Based on this observation, it is reasonable to ask whether these 
ACC deaminase-containing PGPB provide any advantage to uncultivated plants 
growing in the natural environment. In one experiment, researchers isolated and 
characterized spore-forming PGPB from the rhizosphere of wild barley (Hordeum 
spontaneum) plants growing in a region of northern Israel termed “Evolution 
Canyon.” The two slopes of Evolution Canyon, which is located at Mount Carmel 
near Haifa, are around 250 m apart at their bases. The south-facing slope is quite

175
arid, has only very sparse plant growth, and receives eight times the amount of 
sunlight as the north-facing slope that is more like a European forest and includes 
relatively lush plant growth (Fig.  6.13). While both the south- and north-facing 
slope contained similar bacterial genera and species in the barley rhizospheres, the 
bacteria from the much more highly stressed south-facing slope harbored numer-
ous traits to make them more stress resistant (Table  6.4). These traits included 
the ability to utilize ACC as a nitrogen source (i.e., ACC deaminase activity), the 
ability to form biofilms, halophilic growth, and phosphate solubilization activity. 
These data have been interpreted as suggesting that these rhizosphere bacteria, 
together with the plant roots at the south-facing slope, appear to function as com-
plex communities that afford the plant the ability to withstand the harsh conditions 
encountered. In other words, the drought conditions on the south-facing slope 
select for bacteria that contain traits that allow both the PGPB and their plants host 
to better survive these harsh conditions. In addition, under the more moderate con-
ditions found on the north-facing slope, while the same bacteria are present, they 
have mostly lost those traits that facilitate bacterial and plant survival under harsh 
conditions.
Several other recent studies have examined how, in the environment, over-
all plant fitness was largely a function of the soil microbial community. In this

regard, it was observed that plants were most fit when their current environmen-
tal conditions were the same as the historical environmental conditions of the 
associated microbial community. Thus, for example, under drought conditions, 
plants were most fit when the soil microbial community was from soil where 
drought conditions were common rather than from well-watered soil. In one 
study, researchers assessed the geographic distribution of Pseudomonas spp. 
that produced the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid in the rhizosphere of 
wheat plants grown in portions of the US states of Washington and Oregon. This 
study included an assessment of bacterial strains from 61 different commercial 
wheat fields within an area of approximately 22,000 km2. In the first instance, 
every one of the fields that were sampled contained Pseudomonas spp. Secondly, 
a large proportion of the sampled fields contained Pseudomonas spp. that pro-
duced phenazine-1-carboxylic acid. Moreover, researchers noted that there was 
an inverse relationship between the annual rainfall at any particular site and the 
proportion of plants at that site that were colonized by phenazine-1-carboxylic 
acid-producing Pseudomonas spp. (Fig. 6.14). That is, the soil from areas where 
drought was common contained  many more phenazine-1-carboxylic acid-pro-
ducing Pseudomonas spp. than when the soil was well watered. This result is 
consistent with the notion that environmental stress conditions (in particular 
drought) somehow select for the presence of PGPB that decrease plant stress 
including the pressure from plant pathogenic fungi.
The observed behavior of plants and microbes in a natural environment has 
some important implications for plant survival and for agricultural productivity in 
an era of rapid and potentially extensive climate change. That is, it has been sug-
gested that, in attempting to respond to climate change, plants are not necessarily 
limited to strategies in which, to survive, they must either adapt (to the changed

conditions) or else disperse (to locations where conditions are more favorable for 
their optimal growth). Rather, plant survival may be intricately dependent upon 
plant interaction with specific microbial communities.
6.5  Cold Temperature
PGPB that can stimulate plant growth in the laboratory will probably not have any 
significant impact on plants in the field unless the bacteria can grow and persist in 
the natural environment. In countries with cold climates like Canada, these bacte-
ria must be able to survive long cold winters and then grow at cool temperatures 
in the spring—in many cold countries, crops are planted in the spring when the 
soil temperature is 5–10 °C. In cold habitats, the main obstacle for soil bacteria 
to overcome under freezing conditions is typically a decrease in water availability 
(i.e., desiccation). Water dehydration can adversely affect the structure, dynamics, 
stability, and function of biological molecules and subsequently cellular processes 
required for survival. In addition, formation of ice crystals, especially if the ice 
crystals form within a bacterial cell and lyse the cell membrane, can lead to cell 
death from the physical rupture of the cell. Moreover, the changes in osmotic pres-
sures upon freezing can rupture cells.
Freezing and recrystallization rates affect the amount of damage incurred by a 
bacterial cell. Typically, a slower freezing rate is more detrimental than flash freez-
ing. Also, a high recrystallization rate is damaging. Smaller ice crystals with large 
surface areas are thermodynamically unstable; thus, they tend to aggregate and 
recrystallize, thereby forming physically more damaging larger ice crystals.
6.5.1  Antifreeze Proteins
The main line of defense against freezing stress for bacteria is the production of 
cryoprotective molecules including low molecular weight cryoprotectants, anti-
freeze proteins, and (debatably) ice nucleation proteins. Common cryoprotectants 
include a number of alcohol sugars such as trehalose, glycerol, and sorbitol; sug-
ars, such as lactose and sucrose; peptides; and amines such as glycine, betaine, 
arginine, and proline. Secreted cryoprotectant molecules can colligatively depress 
the freezing point of ice formation inducing a state of supercooled water without 
ice formation. Some of these molecules (such as trehalose and proline) also act as 
osmoprotectants facilitating an osmotic balance between the cell and the environ-
ment. Alternatively, in combination with cryoprotectants, some soil bacteria can 
protect themselves from freezing damage via the synthesis and secretion of anti-
freeze proteins that regulate the formation of ice crystals outside of the bacterium.
Antifreeze proteins adsorb onto the prism face of the crystal and limit ice 
growth along the alpha axes (Fig.  6.15). In concentrated solution, the preferred

6  Environmental Interactions
direction of ice crystal growth is along the c-axis forming a hexagonal bipyramid. 
Importantly, bacterial antifreeze proteins structure ice crystals so that they remain 
small and do not pierce the bacterial cell membrane.
To survive overwintering in very cold environments, many bacteria secrete both 
ice nucleation and antifreeze proteins. In this way, ice crystals are formed in a con-
trolled manner, outside of the bacterial cells. Moreover, in some instances, both 
antifreeze and ice nucleation activity are found on the same protein.
Only a very limited number of bacterial antifreeze proteins have been iso-
lated and characterized. Moreover, even fewer bacterial antifreeze protein genes 
have been isolated and characterized. To isolate and characterize a bacterial 
(Pseudomonas) antifreeze protein gene produced by a PGPB strain, the follow-
ing procedure was utilized (Fig. 6.16). First, the bacterium was grown overnight 
at 30 °C (to facilitate a moderate amount of microbial growth) and then for an 
additional 5 days at 4 °C (to induce antifreeze protein production). The antifreeze 
protein, which was secreted to the growth medium, was purified and then partially 
digested with trypsin. It is important to note here that gram-negative bacteria such 
as Pseudomonas spp. only rarely secrete proteins to the growth medium so that it 
is a relatively simple matter to purify antifreeze protein from the growth medium. 
The partial amino acid sequences of some of the peptide fragments (resulting 
from the trypsin digestion) of the antifreeze protein were determined. PCR prim-
ers based on the determined amino acid sequences were designed and then were 
used to amplify a portion of the antifreeze protein gene. The DNA sequence of this 
gene fragment was determined. The bacterial chromosomal DNA was partially

179
restriction enzyme digested, diluted, and then self-ligated to form circles of DNA. 
At this point, a second set of PCR primers (i.e., inverse PCR primers) was then be 
used to amplify the remainder of the antifreeze protein gene.
At the present time, only three bacterial antifreeze genes have been isolated and 
characterized. Unfortunately, the DNA sequences of all three of these genes are 
quite different from one another. Thus, it is not yet possible to examine the data-
base of psychrotrophic and/or psychrophilic bacteria DNA genomic sequences and 
ascertain with any certainty which open reading frames encode antifreeze proteins.
6.5.2  Chilling Stress
Plants may be stressed, not only when the temperature is increased but also when 
the temperature is decreased. This might occur when a cold nighttime temperature 
follows a warm daytime temperature, especially during the spring or fall season of 
the year. The resultant chilling stress can cause electrolytes to leak from plant roots, 
photosynthesis to decrease, and an increase in the amount of the amino acid proline 
that the plant produces. The presence of some PGPB strains has been observed to 
limit the extent of damage from chilling stress despite the fact that the mechanism

6  Environmental Interactions
of this protection is unclear although it could be related to the ability of the bac-
terium to limit stress ethylene synthesis. For example, one group of researchers 
used the endophytic PGPB Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN to protect grapevines 
against chilling stress and found that the bacterium significantly decreased the 
damage to plants when the temperature was lowered from 26 to 4 °C (Fig. 6.17). 
Thus, during chilling stress (i.e., at 4 °C), the presence of the PGPB strain resulted 
in grapevine plants that leaked significantly fewer electrolytes and fixed more car-
bon than untreated plants. Unfortunately, these workers did not ascertain the mech-
anistic basis behind the ability of the PGPB strain to protect plants against chilling 
stress. However, one might speculate that the ability of strain PsJN to lower ethyl-
ene levels via ACC deaminase and/or stimulate plant growth through IAA produc-
tion is responsible for this chilling stress protection. To prove that ACC deaminase 
and/or IAA rather than a trait(s) that is unique to strain PsJN is responsible for this 
behavior, it would be necessary to repeat these experiments comparing the behavior 
of wild-type and ACC deaminase and/or IAA minus mutants of this bacterium.
6.6  Methane and Global Warming
It has been estimated that methane gas is currently responsible for ~25 % of global 
warming. After carbon dioxide, methane is considered to be the second most 
important greenhouse gas. There are several significant sources of methane in the 
environment including livestock, fossil fuel production, and wetland emissions. On 
the other hand, it is also possible to reduce environmental methane levels, either by 
atmospheric chemical oxidation or through oxidation by methanotrophs (bacteria

that can metabolize methane as their only source of carbon and energy) in aerobic 
soils. Since changes to methane production and oxidation have a significant poten-
tial to alter global warming and climate change, scientists have increasingly sought 
to understand the mechanistic details of how methanotrophs oxidize methane. 
During the course of these studies, it was observed that ethylene is able to inhibit 
methane oxidation and that this inhibition occurs at ethylene concentration levels 
that are common in many soils. It has been suggested that this inhibition of meth-
ane oxidation is a consequence of competition between ethylene and methane for 
the active site of the enzyme methane monooxygenase, which carries out the con-
version of methane to methanol. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the majority of 
plant stress responses initiate signaling pathways that trigger the up-regulation of 
plant ethylene synthesis. This presents us with the possibility of creating a poten-
tially dangerous autocatalytic mechanism of global warming. That is, as popula-
tions increase worldwide and more marginal land is used in an attempt to increase 
agricultural productivity, there is likely to be an increasing amount of plant stress 
on a worldwide scale (including increases in drought, flooding, the presence of salt, 
and phytopathogen damage). An increase in plant stress will almost certainly result 
in an increase in the concentration of ethylene that is released by plants into the 
soil. This increase in ethylene levels in the soil can potentially lead to a reduced 
soil capacity to oxidize methane, thereby reducing the ability of many soils to act 
as a biological sink for methane. One group of researchers has suggested that it 
may be possible to limit the extent of the ethylene inhibition of bacterial methane 
monooxygenase through the increased usage of ACC deaminase-containing PGPB 
(Fig. 6.18). At the present time, this entire scenario is highly speculative so that it 
remains to be tested whether this idea works in practice.

6.7  Mycorrhizae
Mycorrhizae are plant-beneficial fungi that form a symbiotic/mutualistic relation-
ship with >95  % of vascular plants. The word mycorrhiza (singular) is derived 
from Greek in which mykos means fungus and riza means roots. In a mycorrhi-
zal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant’s roots, either intracellularly or 
extracellularly. Arbuscular mycorrhizae are exclusively formed by the phylum of 
fungi called Glomeromycota. In addition, both fossil evidence and DNA sequence 
data are consistent with this mutualism beginning about 400–460  million years 
ago, about the same time that the first vascular plants were colonizing the land.
Ectomycorrhizae extracellularly colonize the outside of the roots and are com-
monly found colonizing the root surfaces of woody plants such as birch, oak, fir, 
pine, and rose. Ectomycorrhizae are readily manipulable in that they can be grown 
in culture. On the other hand, endomycorrhizae or arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), 
formerly known as vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM), colonizes roots intra-
cellularly. That is, with AM, the fungus enters the root cells and cannot be grown 
independently of the plant (Fig. 6.19). The mutualistic relationship between this 
Fig. 6.19   Schematic representation of a plant root with ectomycorrhizae shown bound to the left 
side of the root and AM shown bound to the right side of the root. In practice, only one type of 
mycorrhiza will specifically bind to a particular plant root. Different types of root cells are shown 
in different colors. The ectomycorrhizae bind to the root surface, while the AM, attracted by root-
synthesized strigolactones, enter root cells. Myc factors are signaling molecules produced by AM

183
beneficial fungus and plants provides the fungus with fixed carbon and nitrogen, 
and in exchange, the plant is provided with an increased ability to take up water 
and nutrients from the soil.
With AM, nutrient transport occurs through structures that are located inside 
the plant root cells and are called arbuscules. Plant hormones called strigolactones 
(Fig. 6.20) stimulate spore germination, fungal metabolism, and hyphal branching. 
In turn, the fungi release ‘Myc factor’ signaling molecules that induce the plant to 
respond in a manner that facilitates the symbiotic interaction between the plant and 
the AM. Approximately 75–80 million years ago, the Rhizobium–legume symbio-
sis appears to have co-opted the same signaling pathway, including receptors, from 
the much older AM interaction pathway to form a symbiotic interface. Myc fac-
tor induces root cell calcium levels to spike, thereby activating the transcription of 
plant symbiosis genes. In the root cortex, the fungal hyphae enter the apoplast (the 
space between the cells) and branches laterally. Eventually, the hyphae enter root 
cortical cells where they form arbuscules that are unique structures within the corti-
cal cells. New spores are synthesized outside of the plant root. Thus, AM are obli-
gate symbionts that depend entirely upon their host plant for their carbon sources.

6.7  Mycorrhizae

184
6  Environmental Interactions
The major advantage of using mycorrhizae with plants is the increased uptake 
of nutrients, especially phosphorus, and water. This increase in uptake is most 
likely due to the additional surface area of soil contact by the mycorrhizal hyphae. 
In particular, mycorrhizae are generally more efficient than plant roots at taking 
up phosphorus. Phosphorus travels to the plant root by diffusion, and mycorrhi-
zal hyphae reduce the distance required for diffusion, thus increasing phospho-
rus uptake. In addition, mycorrhizal hyphae are much more efficient at taking up 
phosphorus than are root hairs so that the major portion of a plant’s phosphorus is 
often of hyphal origin.
In one series of experiments, Capsicum annum plants (producing spice pep-
pers) were treated with either the AM Glomus deserticola, the PGPB Azospirillum 
brasilense, or both of these organisms. When the plants were grown in the field in 
nutrient-deficient soil, plants treated with both the AM and PGPB grew to the big-
gest size, took up more phosphorus and nitrogen from the soil, and produced more 
fruit (peppers) than the other plants (Table 6.5). This is a good demonstration of 
how the synergism between these two types of organisms may be used to facilitate 
plant growth.
6.7.1  Mycorrhiza Helper Bacteria
In the soil, mycorrhizal fungi interact with a large number of different microorgan-
isms, many of which can affect the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Among the many soil 
microorganisms, a number of bacteria, sometimes called mycorrhiza helper bacte-
ria (MHB), actively promote the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Different MHB can affect 
mycorrhiza in a variety of ways including (i) stimulating spore germination and 
mycelial extension, (ii) increasing mycorrhizal root colonization, (iii) reducing the 
impact of adverse environmental conditions, e.g., by inhibiting microbes that are 
antagonistic to mycorrhizal fungi, (iv) facilitating nutrient mobilization from soil 
minerals, (v) contributing to mycorrhizal nutrition by providing nitrogen (in the 
case of diazotrophs) or iron (from bacterial siderophores), or (vi) by directly low-
ering plant stress.

In one series of experiments, the PGPB P. sp. UW4 was shown to facilitate 
the interaction between the AM fungus Gigaspora rosea and cucumber plants. 
These experiments tested the ability of both the wild-type bacterium and an ACC 
deaminase minus mutant of this strain to enhance plant growth (Fig. 6.21). These 
experiments clearly showed that for every parameter that was measured, including 
plant shoot length, number of leaves, root length, and leaf surface area, maximal 
plant growth was achieved when both AM fungi and the wild-type PGPB bacterial 
strain were present together from the outset of the experiment. Interestingly, the 
next best condition in terms of promoting plant growth was when the AM fungi 
and the ACC deaminase minus mutant were present together. This result suggests 
that while the ACC deaminase from strain UW4 contributes to the observed effect 
on plant growth, other bacterial activities (such as IAA production) are probably 
also important in promoting plant growth. Thus, strain UW4, which can facilitate 
plant growth under a range of stressful conditions, can act as an MGB. This may 
occur by decreasing the small amount of stress incurred by the plants as a conse-
quence of mycorrhizal infection but may also include other bacterial mechanisms. 
The above-mentioned experiment and many other experiments with MHB have 
been performed under controlled greenhouse conditions where the plants were 
grown under near-optimal conditions. However, it would certainly be of interest 
to assess the affect that this and other MHB have on mycorrhizal infection, and 
ultimately on plant growth, under field conditions. Finally, it is interesting to note 
that some researchers have observed that in addition to augmenting crop yield in 
mycorrhiza-treated plants, some MHB can also stimulate anthocyanin levels in 
some plants. Thus, in strawberry fruits, the presence of AM increases the concen-
tration of the antioxidant anthocyanin cyaniding-3-glucoside (responsible for the 
fruit’s red color) and the addition of MHB further increases the amount of this 
compound.

6.8  Changing Plant Gene Expression
Using the techniques of transcriptomics (described in Chap.  4), it is possible to 
elaborate the changes in gene expression that occur within a plant as a consequence 
of that plant’s interaction with PGPB, phytopathogens, or environmental factors 
(such as drought, salt, and metals). In one set of experiments, researchers used a 
transcriptomics approach to compare the effect of adding a wild-type PGPB strain 
to canola seedlings compared to the effect of adding an ACC deaminase minus 
mutant of that PGPB strain. To examine the expression of as many canola genes 
as possible, mRNA isolated from inoculated canola plants (with either wild-type 
or mutant PGPB) was hybridized to an (commercially available) Arabidopsis thal-
iana oligonucleotide microarray. The use of a heterologous A. thaliana microar-
ray was necessitated because of the fact that a commercial canola oligonucleotide 
microarray was not available. The use of the heterologous microarray was justified 
by the fact that in exon sequences, the identities between A. thaliana and canola 
DNA sequences ranged from 85 to 95 %. This gave researchers a high degree of 
confidence that most of the canola mRNAs that hybridized to the microarray rep-
resented the same gene as in A. thaliana. To ascertain that the gene assignments 
based on the A. thaliana genome sequence were largely correct, primers were 
designed (for nine different canola genes) to correspond to the portion of each 
mRNA that would bind the A. thaliana oligonucleotide sequences and the region 
was amplified by real-time PCR and its DNA sequence was determined. All nine 
of the partial canola genes that were sequenced were found to be nearly identical 
to the corresponding A. thaliana genes. In addition, expression values of the canola 
mRNAs that were measured with real-time (and reverse transcription) PCR cor-
related well with the values that were measured using the A. thaliana oligonucleo-
tide microarray. This analysis revealed that bacterial inoculation caused significant 
changes in plant gene expression, where the presence of strain UW4 (either wild-
type or mutant) caused 965 statistically significant expression changes in the shoots 
and 336 in the roots. Moreover, there were 559 expression changes in the shoots 
and 95 in the roots when comparing the effect of the wild-type versus the mutant 
strain, indicating that inoculation of plants with bacteria expressing or not express-
ing ACC deaminase caused different plant responses at the transcriptional level.
A detailed analysis of the changes in plant gene expression that occurred when 
the plant was treated with the wild-type versus the mutant strain revealed that the 
observed changes fell into a number of patterns. For example, upon incubation 
with the ACC deaminase minus mutant strain (compared to the wild-type strain), 
the expression of a number of plant stress-responsive genes was up-regulated. 
These included various heat-shock protein genes, several cytochrome P450 genes, 
some glutathione S-transferase genes, and some genes that had previously been 
identified as either senescence-associated or stress-inducible protein genes. This 
result is consistent with the notion that ACC deaminase functioning lowers stress 
levels in plants. In addition, upon incubation with the wild-type strain (compared 
to the ACC deaminase minus mutant strain), the expression of a number of auxin 

187
responsive and auxin transport proteins was observed to be up-regulated. This 
result was interpreted as indicating that in the presence of a functional ACC deam-
inase, auxin signal transduction was facilitated and led researchers to revise the 
model shown in Fig. 3.18 (Fig. 6.22).

Fig. 6.22   A revised model of how PGPB that produce both IAA and ACC deaminase promote 
plant growth. Plant stress may increase the level of plant IAA production, the transcription of 
the ACC synthase gene (this enzyme converts S-adensoylmethionine, SAM, to ACC), and/or the 
transcription of the ACC oxidase gene (this enzyme converts ACC to ethylene). Ethylene induces 
the synthesis of a number of so-called stress-inducible proteins. Ethylene may also feedback-
inhibit auxin signal transduction. In the presence of ACC deaminase, plant ACC is taken up by 
the bacterium and broken down, thereby preventing a rise in plant ethylene levels with the result 
that (i) plant stress proteins are not synthesized and (ii) auxin signal transduction is not impeded. 
Thus, ACC deaminase facilitates the promotion of plant growth by auxin

7.1  Problem Overview
The problem of toxic waste disposal has accelerated dramatically since the begin-
ning of the industrial revolution. The problems caused by this waste are enormous. 
It has been estimated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that 
more than 40 million tons of hazardous waste is produced each year in the USA. 
Of the many chemicals found in hazardous waste sites in the USA, the Agency 
for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR) lists a number of chemicals 
as priority substances (Table 7.1). Not shown in this Table, cyanide is number 35 
on the ATSDR list, cobalt is number 51, nickel is number 57, zinc is number 75, 
and asbestos is number 94. Altogether, the ATSDR lists 275 compounds as prior-
ity substances, all of which are considered to pose a significant threat to human 
health. Here, it is important to point out that the priority list does not rank sub-
stances based solely on their toxicity, but rather on a combination of their toxic-
ity, their frequency in the environment, and for possibility that humans will be 
exposed to them.
Scientists and engineers have developed several technologies and methods to 
remove toxic compounds from polluted environments. The majority of these meth-
ods include the physical removal of soil to landfill sites or extraction of soil or 
water through chemical or physical means. In addition, the bulk of these proce-
dures are prohibitively expensive. Moreover, many contaminated environments 
contain mixtures of contaminants that are not readily dealt with. Thus, many soils 
are contaminated with one or more metals, other inorganic compounds, radioac-
tive material, or various organic compounds. The metals may include lead, zinc, 
cadmium, selenium, chromium, cobalt, copper, nickel, or mercury; the other inor-
ganic compounds might include arsenic, sodium, nitrate, ammonia, or phosphate; 
the radioactive compounds may be uranium, cesium, or strontium; and the organic 
compounds may include trichloroethylene, trinitrotoluene (TNT), benzene, toluene

and xylene (BTX), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides such as atrazine and bentazon.
Some organic compounds can be broken down by bacteria that may either 
be found in or added to the soil, in the absence of plants; however, this is usually 
slow and inefficient, in part as a consequence of the relatively low concentration of 
these degradative bacteria in soil. On the other hand, the use of plants to remedi-
ate polluted soils, i.e., phytoremediation, is a potentially clean, effective, and relative 
inexpensive technology that is likely to be readily accepted by a concerned public. 
However, this approach also has its drawbacks, as few plant species can tolerate 
high concentrations of environmental contaminants. Some organic compounds can 
be directly degraded and completely mineralized by plant enzymes through phyto-
degradation; many plants produce, and often secreted to the environment, enzymes 
that can degrade a wide range of organic compounds. However, inorganic pollutants 
cannot be degraded. Inorganic pollutants may be either stabilized in the soil to make 
them less bioavailable (i.e., phytostabilization); or extracted, transported, and accu-
mulated in plant tissues (i.e., phytoextraction); or transformed into volatile forms 
(i.e., phytovolatilization). Table 7.2 summarizes the possible fates of environmental 
contaminants that occur as a consequence of phytoremediation (Fig. 7.1).
Given the fact that phytoremediation is still a relatively new and not completely 
proven technology, it is useful to review some of the advantages and disadvantages

of this approach. In this regard, the perceived advantages of phytoremediation 
technology include the following (Table 7.3):
• The cost of using a phytoremediation approach as compared to soil washing or 
soil removal or other more traditional methods of cleaning contaminated envi-
ronmental sites has been estimated to be from 4 to 20 times less expensive.
• Phytoremediation is a passive solar-driven process that does not disturb the 
environment to any great extent.

7  Phytoremediation
• Compared to other more intrusive methods, phytoremediation has a relatively 
high measure of public acceptance.
• Phytoremediation does not disturb or remove topsoil.
• In the field, phytoremediation does not generate any secondary wastes.
On the other hand, phytoremediation is also considered to have a number of poten-
tial drawbacks including the following:
• Effective phytoremediation may often be limited to dealing with contaminants 
that are found within the top few centimeter of the soil because of the fact that 
except for trees, the roots of most plants are not especially deep.
• To be effective and remove a sufficient amount of a particular contaminant from 
soil (or water) and thereby satisfy government mandated contamination limits, it 
may require several seasons of phytoremediation. In practice, this could take years 
with the contaminated land being taken out of use for an extended period of time.
• Many environmental contaminants are toxic to plants with the result that plants 
intended to be part of a phytoremediation protocol may grow only very slowly 
or to a very limited extent in the presence of the relevant contaminant.
• In the process of breaking down some organic contaminants, sometimes bio-
degradation products will be produced that are as toxic (or even more toxic) to 
plant and animal life as the original contaminant. Thus, it is possible that phy-
toremediation might actually make things worse.
• With phytoremediation, there may be a real chance that the targeted contami-
nants can enter the food chain. For example, photovolatilization could result in 
a particular contaminant becoming airborne, eventually contaminating a food 
crop in a farmer’s field that is some distance from the original contaminated 
site. Alternatively, contaminants that are tightly bound to soil particles could 
become more bioavailable (and soluble) and then spread to nearby farmer’s 
fields as runoff following a heavy rainstorm.
7.2  Metals
Until now, the standard approach to cleaning metal-contaminated sites has been 
physical removal of the contaminants followed by landfilling. However, this rel-
atively expensive option merely moves the contaminants from one location to

another. Thus, it is essential that alternative methods of cleaning metal-contami-
nated sites, such as phytoremediation, be developed.
Plants that are exposed to relatively high concentrations of metals (depending 
on the metal involved) may exhibit a decrease in both root and shoot development, 
some level of iron deficiency, damage to the plant resulting from the presence of 
active oxygen species, lower than normal levels of chlorophyll, an increase in the 
expression of stress proteins, and an increase in ethylene production. Only a small 
number of plant species can naturally tolerate/accumulate metals. Unfortunately, 
many of the plants that are most effective at removing metals from the soil (metal 
hyperaccumulators) are both small in size and slow growing. Thus, many of these 
so-called metal hyperaccumulating plants are not especially useful as a component 
of phytoremediation protocols. In addition, to be more effective for soil remedia-
tion, plants should be tolerant to one or more pollutants (often including several 
different metals), highly competitive and fast growing, and produce as high a level 
of biomass as possible. One way to improve the usefulness of many plants in phy-
toremediation protocols is to include specific soil bacteria along with the plants. 
These bacteria may contain one or more of the traits discussed below.
To date, two practical problems have prevented the more rapid development 
of metal phytoremediation technology. First, in many metal-contaminated soils, 
the metals are tightly bound to soil particles so that they are not readily taken 
up by growing plants. These metal contaminants are said to not be bioavailable. 
Researchers are trying to address this issue by employing chemical compounds 
(either directly added to the soil or through the use of bacteria that produce these 
compounds) that can solubilize or release the bound metals thereby making them 
more bioavailable for uptake by growing plants. The second problem in the devel-
opment of practical metal phytoremediation strategies is the fact that many, if not 
most, of the plants that take up metals from the soil localize those metals prefer-
entially within the plant roots and only translocate a small fraction of that metal 
to the rest of the plant. Thus, to remove a metal from soil, after the metal has been 
taken up by a plant, it is necessary to remove the entire plant including the roots 
from the soil, a difficult and labor-intensive task.
7.2.1  Siderophores
When a large amount of metal (such as nickel) is present in the soil, plants become 
highly stressed, not only from the damage directly caused by the presence of the 
contaminating metals, but also because they cannot acquire sufficient iron for all 
of their growth and developmental needs. However, as discussed in Chap. 2, the 
siderophores secreted by PGPB have an extremely high affinity for iron, forming 
an iron–siderophore complex that can be taken up by the plant where it will be 
cleaved, the iron released, and then used by the plant. Thus, siderophores are capa-
ble of taking up sufficient Fe+3, even in the presence of enormous molar excesses 
of contaminating metals (such as nickel), so that the plant will not become starved 
7.2  Metals

196
7  Phytoremediation
for iron (Fig. 7.2). Bacterial siderophores may also sometimes form metal–sidero-
phore complexes facilitating the uptake of a contaminating metal into plants. 
While this may be detrimental for plant growth, it may act to increase the amount 
of metal contaminant that a plant–PGPB combination can take up from the 
environment.
In one series of experiments, researchers were able to select, from a large popu-
lation of bacteria, for a naturally occurring mutant of a PGPB strain that overpro-
duced siderophores (Fig. 7.3). This procedure selects for the genetic variation that 
normally exists in a bacterial population. Thus, it is not necessary to mutagenize 
cells chemically or with radiation in order to find siderophore-overproducing cells. 
It is likely that siderophore overproduction occurs as a result of a mutation in a 
siderophore gene(s) regulatory region.
In one experiment, tomato plants were grown either with no added PGPB, 
the wild-type PGPB, or the siderophore overproducing PGPB whose selec-
tion is described above, all in the presence of 1  mM nickel added to the soil 
(Fig.  7.4). Following several weeks of growth, the plants were harvested and 
various growth-associated parameters, including stem length, plant wet weight, 
and leaf chlorophyll content, were measured. For all of the parameters that were 
measured, the presence of the wild-type PGPB strain stimulated plant growth 
compared to the absence of any added bacterium. Moreover, for each of the 
measured parameters, the mutant PGPB strain promoted growth to a greater

shown as a yellow star), and provide some of the bound Fe+3 to the plant

overproduce siderophores;

extent than the wild-type. Since none of the traits of the PGPB strain other than 
siderophore production (which was increased several fold) were altered, this 
data provide evidence for the role of bacterial siderophores in facilitating plant 
growth in the presence of inhibitory amounts of metals. And, the bottom line 
here is more plant growth means that more metal will be taken up from the soil 
by the plant.
7.2.2  IAA
It is well established that PGPB-produced IAA can both directly promote plant 
growth and protect plant from various environmental stresses such as the presence 
of high salt concentrations. Therefore, it is not surprising that a number of litera-
ture reports indicate that numerous bacteria have been found to either facilitate the 
uptake of metal contaminants by plants or to protect plants from growth inhibition 
by the presence of metals in the environment. Most of these studies are focused on 
identifying bacteria that will make metal phytoremediation work better, and while 
they suggest that a number of bacterial traits may be involved, they generally do 
not provide any definitive proof for the involvement of one or more specific traits. 
Thus, the evidence for the involvement of IAA in facilitating metal phytoremedia-
tion is based on circumstantial and indirect evidence, from what is known about 
IAA’s ability to facilitate plant growth, and it is quite likely that it plays a key role 
in facilitating metal phytoremediation.
In one study, Bacillus subtilis strain SJ-101 was utilized to facilitate the 
nickel accumulation in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). Researchers chose 
to use Indian mustard because it could accumulate moderate levels of nickel 
while producing a reasonably high level of biomass. Moreover, Indian mustard 
is relatively efficient at translocating metals from roots to shoots. Strain SJ-101 
was used because it is nickel resistant and produces both IAA and phosphate 
solubilizing activity. As expected, the presence of strain SJ-101 facilitated the 
growth of plants to a significant extent, especially in the presence of high levels 
of nickel in the soil (Fig. 7.5). Importantly, the results showed a similar trend 
regardless of whether the comparison is of shoot fresh or dry weight, root fresh 
or dry weight, and shoot length or root length. In addition, at all levels of nickel 
that were tested, the amount of nickel taken up by the plant was increased sig-
nificantly (typically by around 50 %). The result of these measurements is that 
by increasing both plant biomass and metal concentration, metal phytoremedia-
tion was significantly facilitated by the addition of strain SJ-101. The one caveat 
to these experiments is that while this bacterial strain played an important role 
in enhancing metal phytoremediation, these workers did not prove that IAA per 
se was responsible for the observed results. To do that, it would be necessary to 
create mutants of strain SJ101 that either under- or overproduce IAA and test 
their efficacy in this system.

199
7.2.3  ACC Deaminase
The ability of the enzyme ACC deaminase to facilitate plant growth by lowering 
plant ethylene levels that might otherwise occur as a result of both biotic and abi-
otic stresses has already been discussed in some detail (see Chaps. 3, 5, and 6). 
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the ability of ACC deaminase to decrease 
the amount of stress ethylene that forms as a consequence of the presence of high 
concentrations of metals in the soil permits plants to grow larger and therefore 
take up more metal from the soil.
In the first published experiments that included PGPB to facilitate metal phy-
toremediation, it was shown that the presence of a bacterium that contained ACC 
deaminase both lowered the amount of ethylene that evolved when plants were 
treated with a 2  mM nickel solution (approximately twofold to threefold) and 
stimulated the growth of treated plants (Fig.  7.6; Table  7.4). Some subsequent 
experiments from the same research group compared the growth of plants that 
were subjected to metal contamination in the presence of either wild-type PGPB 
or an ACC deaminase minus mutant of the wild-type strain. These experiments 
clearly demonstrated that the ACC deaminase minus mutants provided the plants 
with only a very small benefit in terms of growth in the presence of metal con-
taminants. Most likely, this small benefit reflected the fact that the ACC deaminase 
minus mutant could still synthesize IAA and siderophores.
7.2.4  Nitrogen Fixation
More recently, one group of workers compared six different PGPB for the ability 
to promote plant growth in the presence of lead in the soil. Two strains contained

7  Phytoremediation
ACC deaminase, two were nitrogen fixing, and two contained ACC deaminase and 
could also fix nitrogen (Fig. 7.7). In these experiments, corn plants were grown 
in soils containing different amounts of added lead. Then, shoot and root bio-
mass, and shoot and root lead content, as well as (shoot) chlorophyll and (shoot 
and root) protein, were measured. In all instances, the plants derived a small ben-
efit from the ability of the bacteria to fix nitrogen, a larger benefit from the pres-
ence of ACC deaminase activity and a very large benefit from the ability of the 
added PGPB to both fix nitrogen and produce ACC deaminase. Similarly, a differ-
ent group of researchers showed that lotus plants grown in the presence of mine 
wastes that contained lead, zinc, and cadmium produced slightly elevated levels 
of root and shoot biomass when the plant seeds were first incubated with either an 
ACC deaminase-containing PGPB or a nitrogen-fixing strain of rhizobia (Fig. 7.8). 
In this case, the PGPB were expected to lower the plant ethylene levels that occur 
as a consequence of the metal stress, while the rhizobia were expected to increase 
plant growth because of the presence of additional fixed nitrogen (i.e., a fertilizer 
effect). Interestingly, it was only when the plants were treated with both the PGPB 
and the rhizobia strain that dramatic increases in plant growth were observed.

7.2.5  Biosurfactants
As pointed out earlier, in contaminated soils, the metals are often tightly bound 
to soil particles and therefore not bioavailable. Researchers are trying to address 
this issue by employing chemical compounds (either directly added to the soil 
or through the use of bacteria that produce these compounds) that can solubilize 
or release the bound metals thereby making them more bioavailable for uptake 
by growing plants. A number of chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetet-
raacetic acid (EDTA), trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid

(CDTA), ethyleneglycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether),N,N,N′,N-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 
ethylenediamine-N,N′-bis(2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (EDDHA), nitrilotriacetic 
acid (NTA), and organic acids such as citric, malic, acetic, and oxalic acid, have 
been used in an effort to desorb metals from soil particles. However, because of 
their high solubility and persistence in the soil, some chelating agents can cause 
metal leaching, thereby posing an environmental risk for groundwater quality. 
In addition, some chelating agents are toxic to plants and animals. For example, 
EDTA is considered to be toxic based on invertebrate toxicity tests and it has been 
found to reduce growth and cause leaf abscission in some plants. In the search for 
safer and environmentally friendly means of making metal contaminants more bio-
available, researchers have tested various compounds including polyaspartic acid 
(Fig.  7.9) which possesses several carboxylic groups able to coordinate various 
metals, is not toxic, is rapidly biodegraded, and efficiently forms complexes with 
different metals. When polyaspartic acid was tested in the laboratory using metal-
spiked soil, Cu and Zn uptake in plant roots was improved to the same extent as 
with  the best chemical chelating agent. Since polyaspartic acid does not impair 
either plant or bacterial functioning, this suggests that this highly biodegradable 
and non-toxic poly-amino acid may be a good choice for enhanced phytoremedia-
tion of some metals. Moreover, the large-scale production of this compound is a 
well-established and cost-effective industrial process.
Another way of assuring that soil contaminants are bioavailable is through the 
use of biosurfactant-producing bacteria. Biosurfactants are molecules that can 
be produced extracellulary or attached to a cell membrane. They are amphiphi-
lic compounds, i.e., they contain both hydrophobic groups (tails) and hydrophilic 
groups (heads) that can reduce surface and interfacial tensions in both aqueous 
solutions and hydrocarbon mixtures. Biosurfactants have some advantages over 
synthetic surfactants in that they are generally both high specificity and biode-
gradable. At the present time, the commercial use of biosurfactants is some-
what limited because they are expensive to produce. In this regard, optimization 
of the bacterial growth medium optimization may be a key to reducing costs. A 
number of laboratories have reported preliminary experiments in which bacteria 
that actively produce biosurfactants, including some PGPB, have been used as 
adjuncts of phytoremediation processes (Fig.  7.10). For phytoremediation, it is 
advantageous to utilize bacteria that produce biosurfactants rather than purified 
biosurfactants so that the biosurfactants do not have to be added continuously. 
Biosurfactants are useful for metal phytoremediation because they readily form 
complexes with metals, as a result releasing them from the surface of soil parti-
cles (Fig. 7.11). Anionic biosurfactants form nonionic bonds with metals, while

cationic biosurfactants replace the charged metal ions by competition for some of 
the negatively charged surfaces. Eventually, the metal–biosurfactant complex is 
desorbed from the surface of the soil particle and the metal is incorporated into 
a micelle. In fact, biosurfactants have been used to increase the bioavailability of 
both metals and organic contaminants that are bound to soil particles.
In one preliminary experiment, a strain of Pseudomona aeruginosa that pro-
duced a high level of di-rhamnolipid surfactant (Fig.  7.12) was found to suc-
cessfully remove chromium, lead, cadmium, and copper from soil. In this case, 
a 0.1  % di-rhamnolipid biosurfactant solution was used to remove the metals. 
Notwithstanding the success of this experiment, two caveats need to be kept in 
mind. First, not all of the metals were removed from the soil to the same extent so 
that while this procedure may facilitate phytoremediation by making the metals 
more available, it does not completely remove all metals from all soils. Second, 
while Pseudomonas aeruginosa is commonly found in many environments, it is 
a disease-causing bacterium in both animals and humans so that it not likely to be 
applied as an adjunct to phytoremediation in the environment. In a separate study, 
other researchers found that a biosurfactant-producing strain of Bacillus edaphicus

increased the amount of water-soluble (i.e., bioavailable) lead from contaminated 
soil by approximately 40–60 %.
Certainly, the use of biosurfactant-producing bacteria as a component of phy-
toremediation processes is currently at a very early stage of development; how-
ever, initial results indicate that this may become an important way in which the 
problem of contaminant bioavailability is addressed.

For a large number of metal phytoremediation studies, no single mechanism 
has been shown to be central to the ability of PGPB to facilitate plant growth and 
metal uptake in metal-contaminated soils. Rather, many of the studies that have 
been reported have utilized bacteria that have a number of traits that may all 
contribute to the success of this process. As indicated above, these traits include 
siderophore production, IAA synthesis, ACC deaminase activity, biosurfactant 
production, nitrogen fixation activity, and phosphate solubilization activity. In 
addition, it is essential that the PGPB be resistant to a range of different poten-
tially inhibitory metals (and organic contaminants) and be competitive with exist-
ing soil bacteria so that they may efficiently colonize the host plants used in the 
phytoremediation process.
7.3  Arsenic
Admittedly, most of the emphasis in phytoremediation is related to the ability of 
plants to take up and remove contaminants from soil with the plants themselves 
not being used as a food source. However, in some instances, treatment of plants 
with specific bacteria may decrease the translocation of the contaminant from 
roots to the edible (seed) portion of the plant thereby making it possible to con-
sume some crops that have been grown in contaminated soils.
Despite the fact that it is toxic to both animals and plants, the level of arsenic in 
many soils is high and increasing. Not only does arsenic inhibit plant growth, but, 
by entering the edible parts of the plant, it may make some plants unsafe to eat.
Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a rich source of seed protein and is consumed 
worldwide. Chickpea is major source of protein in some countries such as India 
(which accounts for >70  % of the world’s production) so that it is essential to 
ensure that arsenic from contaminated soils does not either decrease the yield of 
chickpeas or make them contaminated and therefore inedible.
In one series of experiments, an arsenic-resistant PGPB strain identified as 
Acinetobacter schindleri, a gram-positive rod that actively produced IAA, ACC 
deaminase activity, and siderophores and had the ability to solubilize phosphate, 
was used to treat the roots of chickpea plants grown in the presence of 10 mg arse-
nic per kg of soil. The treated plants were compared in terms of their shoot length, 
root length, plant biomass, and chlorophyll content (Fig. 7.13). For every parame-
ter measured, the presence of arsenic inhibited the plant’s normal value. Moreover, 
in every instance, the addition of the aforementioned PGPB strain increased the 
measured value to the level equal to or greater than the level observed in the 
absence of added arsenic. Importantly, not only did the presence of the PGPB 
facilitate plant growth in the presence of arsenic, it resulted in an increased level 
of arsenic in the plant roots and a decreased level in the shoots and leaves. Thus, 
the net result of treating chickpea plants with this PGPB strain was that the edible 
part of the plant continued to have a concentration of arsenic that was significantly 
below the level that is deemed to be permissible for human consumption.

7.4  Organics
The development of effective phytoremediation schemes for removing organic 
contaminants from the environment depends upon a number of factors. First, it 
is necessary to identify plants that can tolerate relatively high concentrations of 
the target contaminant. This generally means that the plant both able to grow in 
the presence of the contaminant and can, to some extent, degrade the contami-
nant (typically to harmless environmentally benign compounds). Second, the 
contaminant(s) must be bioavailable. Third, ideally a plant that is used for phy-
toremediation of organic contaminants should grow relatively rapidly and attain 
a high to moderate level of biomass. Fourth, the plant should be capable of inter-
acting synergistically with one or more soil microorganisms that can facilitate 
the breakdown of the organic contaminant. Fifth, the phytoremediation process 
should occur within a reasonable time frame. For example, it may be acceptable to 
develop a phytoremediation process that requires three years to reduce the level of 
a particular contaminant in soil despite the fact that traditional soil removal strate-
gies (that are much more expensive to implement) might occur in a much shorter 
time frame. However, if the land that needs to be remediated is needed for a par-
ticular use, it is generally not acceptable to depend upon a process that could take 
up to twenty years to implement.
PAHs are a particularly recalcitrant group of organic contaminants and are per-
sistent in the environment (Fig. 7.14). They are difficult to degrade and it is both 
expensive and time consuming to remediate them from soils, and the techniques 
that are used are relatively inefficient, primarily degrading the smaller PAHs while 
leaving the larger molecules. There are numerous sources for PAH contamination in 
soils including creosote from the burning of wood and coal, fossil fuel processing,

presence of arsenic, growth

and steel production. Some scientists have attempted to degrade PAHs in bioreac-
tors; however, in this case, it is still necessary to transport the contaminated soils 
to the reactor for the cleanup, an expensive and time-consuming process that often 
damages the natural structure and texture of the soil. Other scientists have attempted 
in situ bioremediation of PAHs. In this case, it is often extremely difficult to gener-
ate sufficient biomass in natural soils to achieve an acceptable rate of movement of 
the hydrophobic PAHs (generally tightly bound to soil particles) to the soil microbes 
where they can be degraded. In addition, most soil microbes are unable to degrade 
larger PAHs. The net result is that microbial biodegradation is, by itself, too slow to 
be a feasible approach to deal with these contaminants.
Phytoremediation (i.e., the degradation of organic compounds by plants) alone is 
not significantly faster than bioremediation (i.e., the biodegradation of the organic 
compounds by microorganisms) for removal of PAHs that include three rings or 
less. However, it is possible to address the relatively slow rate of biodegradation of 
PAHs by plants by adding both degradative and plant growth-promoting bacteria to 
the plant rhizosphere. As discussed earlier, by lowering a portion of the stress that 
is imposed upon the plant by the presence of the PAHs, the PGPB enable plants to 
germinate to a much greater extent and then to grow well and thereby accumulate a 
large amount of biomass. The large, healthier plants, in conjunction with any biodeg-
radative bacteria that are either added or already present in the soil, degrade PAHs 
(and other organic contaminants) at a significantly increased rate.

7  Phytoremediation
Another group of recalcitrant organic environmental contaminant includes 
PCBs. These are synthetic organic compounds in which one to ten chlorine 
molecules are attached to biphenyl, a molecule consisting of two benzene rings 
(Fig. 7.15). PCBs were widely used in a variety of industrial applications as sol-
vents and insulators prior to 1979 when their production was banned in the USA. 
PCBs have been shown to cause cancer in animals and humans as well as endo-
crine disruption and neurotoxicity. The toxicity of PCBs is a function of not only 
the number of chlorine atoms but also their position within the benzene rings. 
PCBs are considered to be a persistent organic pollutant, soluble in lipids and 
organic solvents, but not water, and are still found in many former industrial sites 
throughout the world.
In one series of laboratory experiments, canola plants were grown in soil that 
had been previously mixed with creosote, a common PAH. To possibly facilitate 
the phytoremediation of the creosote, a PGPB strain and its derivatives were used 
to inoculate the canola seeds when they were planted (Fig. 7.16). In these experi-
ments, the various treatments included (i) no added PGPB, (ii) addition of the PGPB 
Pseudomonas asplenii previously isolated from PAH-contaminated soil, (iii) addi-
tion of the aforementioned P. asplenii transformed with an ACC deaminase gene

(and its regulatory region) isolated from a different Pseudomonas strain, and (iv) 
addition of the transformed P. asplenii strain encapsulated in alginate beads. The 
data from this experiment clearly indicate that the added PGPB strain facilitates both 
root and shoot growth compared to the control; the ACC deaminase transformed 
strain facilities growth to a greater extent (the wild-type bacterium does not contain 
ACC deaminase); and the alginate encapsulated bacterium stimulated growth to the 
greatest extent. This result may be explained as follows. In the first instance, the 
presence of the PGPB strain facilitates plant growth, even in the presence of plant 
inhibitory levels of creosote. In this instance, the observed plant growth promotion 
is likely a consequence of the bacterial IAA that is provided to the plant. Second, 
as expected based on the behavior of other PGPB, the presence of ACC deaminase 
activity lowers the level of inhibitory stress ethylene in the plant. Third, it is assumed 
that as the alginate slowly dissolves in the soil, the encapsulated PGPB are steadily 
released, with the consequence that there is a continuous source of the bacterium 
in the plant rhizosphere potentially allowing for more extensive colonization of the 
plant root by the PGPB. In addition to the demonstrated advantage of encapsulating 
the abovementioned PGPB in alginate, other researchers have shown that alginate 
encapsulation may provide some bacterial strains with long-term stability thereby 
facilitating their use on a commercial scale. While work of the sort described above 
is an important step in developing protocols for the removal of PAHs from contami-
nated environments, it is essential to test whether the success seen in the laboratory 
can be reproduced in a field situation.
In a different laboratory/greenhouse experiment, researchers have shown that 
the addition of an ACC deaminase-containing PGPB to Kentucky bluegrass grow-
ing in the presence of varying amounts of added PAHs caused the plants to grow 
to a much greater size than when the PGPB were not added (Fig. 7.17). In this

experiment, plants were grown for 120 days before their growth was assessed. In 
addition to facilitating an increase of plant biomass in these experiments, when 
the PGPB were present not only were more PAHs degraded, but the more recal-
citrant larger molecules were degraded to a greater extent than in the absence of 
the PGPB. Moreover, experiments with different grasses and several different 
ACC deaminase-containing PGPB have shown that the results seen in the labora-
tory are also seen in the field. In some instances, with the addition of these bacte-
ria, 30–55 % of either PAHs or total petroleum hydrocarbons (Fig. 7.18) has been 
observed to be removed from contaminated soils in a single growing season.
7.5  Endophytes
Interestingly, the majority of the studies where PGPB have been used to facili-
tate phytoremediation have employed bacterial endophytes rather than rhizos-
pheric bacteria. In one study, researchers transferred a biodegradative plasmid 
from a rhizospheric bacterium to an endophytic strain and found that the newly 
engineered endophyte significantly improved the phytoremediation of certain 
compounds (Fig. 7.19). Thus, when a rhizospheric bacterium with a large plas-
mid encoding a biochemical pathway for the breakdown of toluene was present 
in the rhizosphere of yellow lupin plants, the plants were able to partially break-
down toluene that was present in the soil. Despite the fact that some of the tolu-
ene was degraded, a significant fraction of the toluene was volatilized so that this

petroleum hydrocarbons in

growth of annual ryegrass

deaminase-containing PGPB

combination of plant and bacteria resulted in the transfer of a good deal of the soil 
toluene to the air, a problematic outcome. On the other hand, when the plasmid 
was transferred, by conjugation, to a bacterial endophyte, the degradative endo-
phytic bacterium, when it was inside of the plant, largely degraded the toluene 
with a 50–70 % reduction in evapotranspiration through the plant leaves. In addi-
tion, at all of the toluene concentrations tested, plants achieved the highest level 
of biomass in the presence of the endophytic strain carrying the degradative plas-
mid (Fig. 7.20). In this experiment, both the rhizosphere-binding bacterium and 
the endophyte were strains of Burkholderia spp. Since the biodegradative plas-
mid was transferred by conjugation and not by any so-called unnatural form of 
genetic engineering, these scientists expect that such an engineered strain will be 
acceptable to various regulatory agencies for use in the environment. These work-
ers anticipate that this approach may eventually be utilized with (fast growing) 
poplar trees to phytoremediate groundwater that is contaminated with water-sol-
uble organic compounds. Moreover, to make this system more efficient, it may 
be possible to introduce degradative plasmids into PGPB strains that can promote 
plant growth and lower plant stress thereby further increasing the effective plant 
biomass.

7  Phytoremediation
In a more recent experiment, researchers added a suspension of a strain of 
Pseudomonas putida that had previously been shown to act as a root endophyte 
of poplar trees to the roots of small poplar trees. P. putida is a very common soil 
bacterium and is considered to not be harmful to either animals or humans. Prior to 
inoculating trees with the selected endophytic bacterium, a naturally occurring plas-
mid that encoded the ability to degrade trichloroethylene was transferred into the P. 
putida strain by bacterial conjugation. Trichloroethylene, often found as a contami-
nant of groundwater, is an industrial solvent that is considered to be a human car-
cinogen. Unfortunately, some anaerobic soil bacteria can reductively dehalogenate 
trichloroethylene to produce vinyl chloride, which is an even more toxic compound. 
These researchers sought to test whether the planta bioaugmentation of phytoreme-
diation with endophytic bacteria would enhance the remediation of trichloroethyl-
ene. The behavior of three uninoculated poplar trees was compared with three poplar 
trees that were inoculated with the transformed P. putida endophytic strain con-
taining the trichloroethylene degrading plasmid. The trees were all planted in soil 
where the groundwater contained trichloroethylene in concentrations up to 100 mg 
per liter. Two years after the trees were planted, researchers measured the amount 
of trichloroethylene that was evapotranspirating through the leaves of these trees. 
The three trees that had been incubated with the transformed bacterium displayed a 
much lower level of evapotranspiration than the trees without this bacterium indicat-
ing that the bacterially treated trees had broken down the trichloroethylene, while 
the untreated trees continued to transfer the trichloroethylene from the groundwa-
ter to the air (Table 7.5). Not only are these results highly encouraging, in addition, 
according to European Union legislation, the transformed P. putida endophytic 
strain is considered to be a non-genetically modified organism (i.e., a non-GMO) 
with the result that it can be employed in field applications. This is because the nat-
urally occurring plasmid that encoded the ability to degrade trichloroethylene was

transferred into the endophytic P. putida strain by bacterial conjugation, which is not 
considered to be genetic manipulation. It is interesting to note that in the presence of 
trichloroethylene, the introduced bacterium became the dominant endophytic strain 
in the three treated poplar trees. However, when the transformed P. putida strain was 
grown in the absence of trichloroethylene, the introduced bacterium lost its degrada-
tive plasmid in ~20 generations.
7.6  Phytoremediation and OMICS
A large number of variables can affect the success of using phytoremediation to 
clean up various environmental contaminants. These variables include the plant 
(genus, species, and cultivar), the nature of the contaminants (metals or organics), 
the type of soil, the presence of compounds (other than the target contaminants) 
in the soil that affect plant growth, the microorganisms present in the soil (and 
their metabolic capabilities), and the weather. For a phytoremediation process to 
be as effective as possible, it is important to understand how these variables might 
affect plant growth and development. One way to gain some insight into how these 
variables affect plant growth is to employ the techniques of transcriptomics, prot-
eomics, and/or metabolomics. In addition, it is also possible to utilize the above-
mentioned “omics” techniques to document changes to PGPB that are used to 
facilitate the phytoremediation process that are caused by various environmental 
contaminants.
7.6.1  Changes to Plants
In one study, researchers isolated and characterized a  PGPB, Pseudomonas sp. 
TLC 6-6.5-4, from lake sediment that promoted the growth of corn (maize) plants 
in the presence of high levels of copper. This bacterium is free-living, resistant to

high concentrations of a number of different metals, produces IAA and sidero-
phores, and solubilizes inorganic phosphate. In the first instance, the way in which 
plants were inoculated with the PGPB significantly affected plant growth and 
metal uptake. Thus, the greatest level of plant biomass was obtained when plant 
roots were immersed in a suspension of the PGPB prior to planting. On the other 
hand, when the PGPB were mixed with the soil prior to sowing seeds or the seeds 
were coated with the PGPB prior to planting, a significantly greater level of cop-
per uptake resulted.
In the sandy soil that was used for these experiments, the amount of available 
phosphorus was quite low. Fortunately, the Pseudomonas sp. strain that was uti-
lized was able to solubilize inorganic phosphate from the environment and pro-
vide it to the plants. In addition, the PGPB slightly, but significantly, increased the 
translocation of the copper taken up by the roots to the shoots. As well, the amount 
of soluble protein in the plants grown in the presence of the PGPB was increased 
by approximately 20 % compared to the absence of the PGPB. Importantly, at the 
end of a 45-day growing period in copper-contaminated soil, maize plants not only 
produced more biomass in the presence of the PGPB, but they also took up consid-
erably more copper from the soil (Fig. 7.21).
Based on a proteomic analysis of 45-day-old plants grown either in nor-
mal soil or in copper-containing soil, with or without PGPB, 85 maize proteins 
were observed to show significant changes in response to PGPB inoculation. 
In this case, a significant change was defined as an increase in protein expres-
sion ≥2 or a decrease in expression ≤0.5. The level of synthesis of ~85 proteins 
changed significantly. The identities of many of these proteins were determined 
by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass 
spectrometry analysis. In normal soil, the main host proteins altered by PGPB 
inoculation are related to plant development and photosynthesis. In addition, 
maize proteins involved in regulation and signal transduction, cellular metabolism,

and protein folding and degradation also changed in response to PGPB inocula-
tion. In contaminated soil, treatment with PGPB affected proteins that impact the 
plant’s cellular metabolism and stress response. Proteins involved in DNA repair, 
methionine biosynthesis, malate metabolic process, photosynthesis, and carbon 
fixation were upregulated, while the synthesis of several antioxidant enzymes 
(such as glutathione S-transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) was sig-
nificantly reduced as a result of PGPB inoculation. Plant phytochelatins play 
an important role in plant development and metal detoxification. The enzyme 
γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCL), which plays a key role in phytochela-
tin synthesis, was significantly upregulated in contaminated soil compared with 
maize grown in normal soil. GCL expression was downregulated in the presence 
of PGPB in contaminated soil and upregulated in the presence of PGPB in normal 
soil. These results indicate that the addition of this PGPB alleviates the stress of 
host plants caused by high concentrations of copper.
Analysis of the metabolites present in maize plants treated or untreated with 
PGPB and grown in copper-contaminated soil revealed a number of ­significant 
changes in these plants. This analysis revealed that the pathways that were 
increased by the presence of the PGPB included those encoding glutathione, pro-
line, and ascorbate metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, the TCA cycle, 
galactose metabolism, and carbon fixation. In the contaminated soil, the presence of 
the PGPB led to the downregulation in maize of glutathione and proline metabolism 
as well as significant decreases in antioxidant compounds such as phenolics. In gen-
eral, the metabolomics results matched the results obtained by proteomics. That is, 
the PGPB stimulated plant growth and development and decreased the expression 
of plant defense proteins and metabolites, presumably because the PGPB alleviated 
a significant portion of the stress caused by the presence of the copper.
7.6.2  Changes to PGPB
As discussed above, the addition of PGPB to a plant can significantly change the 
gene expression and hence the metabolism and physiology of its plant host regard-
less of whether the bacterium has bound to the root surface or is localized within 
the plant tissues. At the same time, the gene expression, and hence the metabolism 
and physiology of the PGPB, is also subject to change, in this case as a conse-
quence of the interaction of the bacterium with (1) the plant and (2) a wide range 
of compounds found in the environment.
7.6.2.1  Bacterial Changes Caused by Plants
The changes in PGPB, especially when the bacterium is found primarily within 
the plant rhizosphere, may be examined following the treatment of the PGPB with 
plant root exudates. In this way, bacterial proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites

are not contaminated with these materials from the plant. Canola seeds were ger-
minated (approximately 2  days) and grown for a total of seven days in growth 
pouches in water in the absence of soil. The remaining liquid was filtered using a 
2-μm filter to remove any particles or microorganisms. PGPB (Pseudomonas sp. 
UW4) cells were grown in minimal medium containing filtered canola root exu-
date before the protein contents were analyzed. The experiments included both 
wild-type and an ACC deaminase minus mutant of the PGPB. Out of 1,700–1,800 
proteins that were detected on the two dimensional gels, the expression levels of 
~300 proteins changed. About 60 % of the proteins whose expression was altered 
had increased expression, while the remaining 40 % of proteins showed decreased 
expression. Of the proteins with altered expression, 72 proteins could be identified 
by mass spectrometry. These data indicate that the wild-type PGPB cause (i) an 
increase in nutrient utilization, (ii) an increase in membrane protein expression, 
with these proteins possibly involved in the bacterial colonization of roots, (iii) 
an increase in several soluble proteins previously implicated in interacting with 
plants, and (iv) a decrease in bacterial communication (chemotaxis and quorum 
sensing) proteins.
Four of the identified proteins (whose expression levels changed dramatically) 
were selected for additional analysis. These proteins included one upregulated pro-
tein (outer membrane protein F, OmpF) and three downregulated proteins (peptide 
deformylase, Pdf; transcription regulator Fis; and a previously uncharacterized 
protein, Hyp). The genes encoding these four proteins were amplified by PCR 
using primers whose sequences were based on analogues from other Pseudomonas 
strains. These four genes were cloned into a Pseudomonas–Escherichia shut-
tle expression vector, and each cloned gene was used to construct a PGPB strain 
that overproduced one of the selected proteins. In addition, the genes encod-
ing three of these four proteins were disrupted to produce mutant strains of the 
PGPB. The strain with the Pdf minus mutant was unable to survive, presumably 
because this mutation was lethal. The canola root elongation promoting the ability 
of the wild-type, the four overexpressing mutants, and the three disruption mutant 
(non-expressing) strains were tested (Fig. 7.22). This assay revealed that (i) the 
Fis protein overexpressing and knockout strains showed no significant difference 
compared with the wild-type, (ii) the strains overexpressing the Pdf and the OmpF 
proteins and the Hyp protein knockout strain promoted root length more than the 
wild-type, and (iii) the OmpF protein knockout strain and the Hyp protein over-
expresser lost their root-length-promoting activity. In fact, overexpression of Hyp 
inhibited root growth relative to the untreated plants, suggesting that high levels of 
this protein were detrimental to plant growth.
Based on the results summarized in Fig. 7.22, the plant-growth-promoting activ-
ity of strain UW4 depends on the outer membrane protein OmpF, an integral mem-
brane protein that forms a nonspecific transport channel responsible for the passive 
transport of small molecules across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. 
Thus, knocking out the production of OmpF may disrupt the transport of ACC from 
plant cells into attached bacterial cells, because ACC deaminase is localized and 
functions in the bacterial cytosol. In addition, the OmpF protein may be involved

in bacterial cell adhesion to the plant. Second, Pdf is involved in protein matura-
tion after translation through its activity to remove the N-formyl group of N-formyl 
methionine. The fact that the Pdf-protein-disrupted strain was not viable suggests 
that this protein is essential in bacterial cells. Downregulation of Pdf in response to 
plant exudates could reflect a plant mechanism to inhibit bacterial growth and limit 
colonization by bacterial pathogens. The strain overexpressing the Pdf protein pro-
moted root length to a greater extent than the wild-type, possibly by overcoming the 
inhibitory effects of a putative plant compound. The protein Hyp is predicted, based 
on its homology to proteins of known function, to be a potential DNA binding pro-
tein. It is possible that the Hyp protein has a role in regulation of genes related to 
virulence in this PGPB strain, causing detrimental effects on plant growth. Thus, the 
Hyp-protein-overexpressing strain may have transformed this bacterium into a dele-
terious organism that caused a decrease in root length compared with control plants.
What is clear from the work that has been reported up until now is that when 
a bacterium interacts with a plant, the physiology of both of them is altered. This 
means that there are potentially a large number of bacterial proteins, many of them 
that have not been previously associated with plant growth promotion that can 
impact on the effectiveness of a particular PGPB. It is hoped that a better under-
standing of the many bacterial activities that affect the interaction between bacte-
ria and plants will lead to an increased ability to select and utilize new and more 
efficacious PGPB strains.

7.6.2.2  Bacterial Changes Caused by Environmental Contaminants
In addition to changes to PGPB physiology that are brought about by its interac-
tion with a host plant, to be effective, PGPB need to be able to function in the 
presence of a wide range of contaminants. The simplest way of assessing how 
various contaminants affect bacterial metabolism is to compare the differences 
in mRNA production, protein expression, or metabolite levels in PGPB in the 
absence and presence of one or more contaminants.
PGPB containing certain traits have been shown to be able to facilitate plant 
growth and increase contaminant uptake by plants and/or contaminant degrada-
tion. PGPB that possess one or more of these traits are more effective at facilitat-
ing phytoremediation; however, the limited number of known bacterial traits that 
facilitate phytoremediation are only part of the story.
In one series of experiments, the PGPB Pseudomonas sp. UW4 were grown 
in the presence of high levels of nickel and the changes in the protein profile of 
the bacterium were determined. In total, the levels of 35 proteins were found to 
change significantly. Several proteins involved in amino acid synthesis and protein 
synthesis, DNA replication, and cell division were down-regulated. On the other 
hand, several transport proteins (both import and export) were all up-regulated. 
The other up-regulated proteins included general stress proteins and antioxidative 
proteins.

8.1  PGPB in the Environment
Irrespective of how well PGPB perform to facilitate plant growth under con-
trolled laboratory conditions, their ultimate utility depends upon how effective 
they are under greenhouse and field conditions. A variety of considerations can 
have an impact on the use of PGPB in situations outside of the laboratory includ-
ing whether or not the bacterium has been genetically modified, the type of plant 
being cultivated, temperature, and soil conditions including the presence of other 
microorganisms, pH, compaction, and mineral content. In addition, it is essential 
to consider not only those factors that permit an introduced PGPB to be effec-
tive in the field, but also any governmentally imposed guidelines that regulate the 
deliberate release of these organisms to the environment. In some jurisdictions, 
only the release of genetically engineered organisms is controlled by legislation, 
while in many others, even the release of native unmodified organisms is subject to 
regulatory oversight.
The deliberate environmental release of PGPB is not a new or recent develop-
ment. In the 1930s through the 1950s, a number of different bacteria including 
Azotobacter spp. and Bacillus megaterium were used in the field on a large scale 
in an attempt to provide crops with either fixed nitrogen or solubilized phosphate 
(or both)—Azotobacter spp. are diazotrophic, while B. megaterium is well known 
for its ability to solubilize phosphate. The results of these early experiments, while 
initially promising, were highly variable causing this approach to be discarded. 
To a large extent, the variability that was observed was a consequence of the lack 
of an in-depth understanding of PGPB and the mechanisms that they employed, 
notwithstanding the fact that this work was undertaken several years prior to the 
existence of the term PGPB. With the fact that bacterial fertilizers were seemingly 
unreliable, this approach was largely abandoned as agriculture began to emphasize 
the use of inexpensive, reliable, and effective chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
However, with the realization, some years later, that many agricultural chemicals 
can cause or contribute to a variety of environmental problems, interest in using 
PGPB to facilitate plant growth was renewed beginning in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Moreover, many developing countries lack the funds to purchase chemical ferti-
lizers and pesticides so that bacterial inoculants could play a significant role in 
improving agricultural productivity in these countries. In addition, with the advent 
of recombinant DNA technology, many individuals in society became concerned 
about what they perceived to be the looming dangers of this new and “unnatural” 
biological technology and the possibility that it might become a major and perva-
sive component of modern agriculture.
Regardless of whether the microorganisms that are deliberately introduced into 
the environment are native unmodified strains or genetically engineered microor-
ganisms, it is essential that they are not harmful to the environment (especially 
plants and animals) in any way, either in the short or long term. Thus, prior to 
the deliberate release of PGPB to the environment, a number of factors need to 
be thoroughly considered (Fig. 8.1). Specific knowledge about the behavior of the 
PGPB is required ahead of time including (i) how well the organism is able to

to the environment

225
survive in the environment, (ii) whether it will be able to grow and proliferate in 
different environments, (iii) what the probability is that DNA from the released 
PGPB will be transferred to other microorganisms in the environment, (iv) what 
the likelihood is that the PGPB will be widely disseminated throughout the envi-
ronment, and (v) whether the PGPB is harmful to any other organisms in the 
environment.
Generally, the number of introduced PGPB in the environment declines after 
their introduction, sometimes after a brief period of proliferation during which 
time the number of introduced organisms may increase. Typically, the number of 
introduced PGPB in the bulk soil declines rapidly; however, once they become 
established in the rhizosphere, they may persist for several months with little or no 
further decline in their number.
A wide range of different factors can affect the survival and proliferation of 
PGPB that are introduced into the environment. (i) Bacterial survival varies con-
siderably in different soil types with organisms generally surviving to a much 
greater extent in nutrient-rich soils and in soils with a high clay content. (ii) PGPB 
that are bound to the roots of plants can persist for months, while a population of 
the same organism in the bulk soil may decrease by five or six orders of magnitude 
in the same period of time. (iii) Endophytic PGPB, once they become established 
within a plant’s tissues, can persist for prolonged periods of time (sometimes 
years), often related to the life of the plant host. (iv) Bacterial survival is influ-
enced by several soil parameters such as pH, temperature, compaction, and oxy-
gen content. (v) In general, PGPB that have been genetically modified are less able 
to survive and proliferate in the environment than are the non-transformed forms 
of these organisms. In most cases, this is probably a consequence of the metabolic 
load (see below) that is imposed on genetically transformed cells by the expres-
sion of foreign DNA. In addition, laboratory culturing of PGPB, especially in rich 
growth media, may result in some strains losing genes that previously made them 
more competitive/effective in the environment.
8.1.1  Environmental Concerns
To date, the deliberate release of PGPB has taken place mainly on a controlled, 
small to moderate scale, and no incidents have occurred to suggest that the release 
of bacteria, genetically engineered or otherwise, poses any serious threat to the 
environment or to human health. However, since there is the potential for these 
bacteria to be used on a very large scale, considering the huge area of agricultural 
land worldwide, it is necessary to proceed with considerable caution. This cau-
tion is based largely on the experience with the large-scale environmental use of 
chemicals such as the insecticide DDT. In that instance, the successful small-scale 
tests gave no indication of the problems that would eventually arise when DDT 
was used on a massive scale worldwide, resulting in substantial accumulation of 
toxic levels of DDT in the environment.
8.1  PGPB in the Environment

226
8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
8.1.1.1  Transfer of Genes to Other Organisms
Bacterial genes, whether native or introduced by genetic engineering, can readily 
be transferred to other organisms. In fact, the transfer of DNA from one organism 
to another in the natural environment has probably been going on for many mil-
lions of years.
While DNA transfer between organisms can take place, it is important to ask 
how frequently this actually occurs in the environment. For a start, several fac-
tors limit the transfer of genes between bacteria including plasmid incompatibil-
ity and host-range restrictions, recognition of DNA as foreign by host restriction 
endonucleases, and lack of physiological competency to donate or take up DNA. 
In addition, the metabolic load imposed by newly acquired genes may mean that 
they are readily lost. Nevertheless, now that several thousand bacterial genomes 
have been completely sequenced, it is clear that many, if not most, soil bacteria 
contain a number of stretches of DNA that appear to have been transferred from 
other soil bacteria, likely by transposable elements. Clearly, all possible conse-
quences of gene transfer cannot be predicted nor may the potential for harm be 
obvious.
Even without gene transfer, introduced organisms may have consequences 
other than those intended. For example, secondary metabolites may affect non-tar-
get organisms, especially if the production of these has been enhanced by genetic 
manipulation. For example, the overproduction of antibiotics by biocontrol PGPB 
may be deleterious to other beneficial or benign microbes or to the host plant, as 
well as to the target phytopathogens.
8.1.1.2  Monitoring PGPB
In monitoring the effects of an introduced PGPB, it is essential to be able to sepa-
rate out the effects attributable to the introduced bacterium from the effects caused 
by indigenous soil bacteria. To do this, the introduced bacterium may be detected 
by using either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of expressed pro-
teins, nucleic acid hybridization—either with or without PCR amplification—
or by using molecular markers. Marking or “tagging” a microorganism may be 
defined as, “the intentional introduction of genes conferring distinctive pheno-
typic properties which enable tracking of the marked organism after introduction 
into the environment.” For a start, the phenotype expressed by the marker gene 
should not be expressed by the indigenous microbial population. In addition, as a 
consequence of metabolic load, marker genes are considerably more stable when 
they are integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the organism being marked than 
when they are introduced on plasmids. At the present time, for all field applica-
tions, there is a strong reluctance of most regulatory agencies worldwide to permit 
the introduction of any exogenous genes into PGPB strains, thus limiting the use-
fulness of this approach.

227
Only a handful of genes have been used as molecular markers for the various 
microbial strains that are released into the environment. These genes include anti-
biotic resistance genes, which regulators discourage researchers from employing 
fearing that these genes will spread to other soil bacteria, thereby increasing the 
proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the soil. However, it is often possible 
to select, in the laboratory, rifampicin-resistant mutants that occur naturally within 
populations of many bacteria because of a minor alteration in the host RNA poly-
merase. In the laboratory including the greenhouse and growth chamber, a number 
of different marker genes have been tested successfully including the Escherichia 
coli lacZY genes encoding β-galactosidase and lactose permease—cells that 
express these genes can be detected on solid medium containing a chromogenic 
substrate which turns a blue color; the Pseudomonas putida xylE gene which codes 
for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme that converts colorless catechol to a yel-
low color; a Pseudomonas gene encoding the enzyme 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate 
monooxygenase which converts phenoxyacetate to phenol, and can produce a red 
color in a coupled reaction; the Vibrio fischeri or V. harveyi lux, or biolumines-
cence, genes encoding bacterial luciferase—detecting the activity of these genes 
involves the oxidation of a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde and reduced flavin mono-
nucleotide with the liberation of free energy in the form of blue-green light; the 
P. syringae ice nucleation gene, inaZ, can be used to monitor bacterial activity on 
plant surfaces; and the gene for the green fluorescent protein, gfp–green fluorescent 
protein, exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to blue to ultraviolet light.
In one study, the PGPB Kluyvera ascorbata SUD165/26 was labeled with 
either lux or gfp genes. Both labels enabled researchers to sensitively detect the 
presence of labeled bacteria. Nevertheless, it was important to ascertain that the 
expression of these labels did not interfere with the biological activity of the 
PGPB strain. Thus, the labeled strains were compared to the native, unlabeled, 
strain in their ability to promote the growth of 25-day-old canola seedlings in a 
growth chamber in the presence of 3 mM nickel in the soil. As can be seen in 
Table 8.1, the labeled strains both promoted plant growth to statistically the same 
extent as the unlabeled strain, indicating that the expression of either of these 
two labels did not interfere with the functioning of the PGPB. In addition, over a 
period of six weeks, it was observed that the labeled strains persisted to the same 
extent in soil as the unlabeled strain.

228
8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
8.1.1.3  Some Environmental Hazards
As mentioned above, nearly all soil bacteria, including PGPB, appear to exchange 
DNA with other soil bacteria. In addition, in two separate studies of the phylog-
eny of ACC deaminase genes, it was concluded that genes of bacterial origin had, 
on numerous occasions, been transferred to the genomes of some alga and some 
fungi. This is just one example of how bacterial genes can be transferred to non-
target organisms that may be quite different from the original bacterium and indi-
cates that any deliberate release of PGPB into the environment must be done with 
both caution, possibly including extensive long-term monitoring of the fate of the 
introduced organism and its unique genes.
In addition to the possibility of gene transfer from a released PGPB strain, there 
is a small but very real possibility for some PGPB to either act as human patho-
gens or to be contaminated with human pathogens. This situation is exacerbated 
by the fact that since PGPB are used to facilitate plant growth, they may become 
associated with the crop plant whose growth they have facilitated, thereby poten-
tially contaminating human food.
8.1.1.4  Releasing Transgenic Rhizobia
Rhizobia are by far the most important species of bacterial inoculants worldwide, 
having been marketed for more than 100 years. In addition to being used on a rela-
tively large scale, rhizobia have been extensively tested. Thus, prior to the devel-
opment of genetic engineering, there were numerous field studies of the efficacy, 
competitive ability, and survival of different rhizobial strains.
It is important to monitor gene transfer in rhizobia because the symbiotic genes 
are located on the pSym, one of several large (>100 kb) plasmids that are pre-
sent in most rhizobial species. Usually, these plasmids are quite stable and their 
detailed characterization can provide an effective means of identifying (finger-
printing) inoculants when these bacteria are reisolated from soil. This is notwith-
standing the fact that some plasmids are capable of conjugal transfer, thereby 
resulting in phenotypic changes in the recipient cell. In practice, both the possi-
bility of transgene movement from the engineered inoculant strain to other bac-
teria in the field and the possibility that individual inoculant rhizobia might lose 
or acquire plasmids in the environment must be considered. In this regard, natu-
rally occurring strains of R. leguminosarum typically have three to six plasmids, 
while strains of Sinorhizobium spp. carry a smaller number of large plasmids. On 
the other hand, in Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, the symbiotic genes are 
located on the chromosome rather than on large plasmids.
At the present time, according to European Union (EU) rules, “any organisms 
altered by recombinant DNA techniques and… techniques involving the direct 
introduction into an organism of heritable material prepared outside the organ-
ism including microinjection, macroinjection and microencapsulation” is subject 
to a very high level of government as well as community scrutiny before it can 

229
be used in the environment (http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/agriculture/
food/l28130_en.htm). Among other things, this restriction dramatically limits 
the deliberate release of transgenic PGPB in the environment within the EU and 
also limits the importation of transgenic PGPB into the EU. However, accord-
ing to current EU rules, genetic modification does not include bacterial strains 
whose construction was by conjugation, transduction, or transformation (with 
naturally occurring plasmids). Nor does the EU definition of genetic modifica-
tion include traditional mutagenesis. As a result, bacterial strains that are marked 
(so that they can be monitored in the environment) by the insertion of a transpo-
son are classified as not genetically modified. Table 8.2 summarizes some of the 
information that is required in the EU before a genetically modified organism

can be released into the environment. In addition to detailed information about 
the transgenic organism itself, the EU also requires information regarding the 
details of the proposed release including the date and place of the release, the 
amount of the transgenic organism that will be released, physical and chemical 
information about the soil at the release site, a detailed plan for ongoing moni-
toring, the presence of the transgenic organism in the environment, etc. Here, it 
should be emphasized that (i) these requirements may be continually updated 
(especially as new knowledge is gained) and (ii) the guidelines/requirements 
established by the EU are similar to the approach taken in many other countries 
around the world.
Over the past 20  years, a number of transgenic rhizobial strains have been 
released to the environment in both the USA and the EU (Table 8.3). Most of 
these studies have been done with the objective of monitoring either (i) the envi-
ronmental functioning of potentially improved strains (i.e., strains that appeared 
to be better than non-transgenic wild-type strains under laboratory conditions) 
or (ii) the environmental fate of marked strains. In one study with transgenic S. 
meliloti, when the indigenous soil population of S. meliloti was low, the trans-
genic strain occupied more than 90 % of the nodules on host alfalfa plants. On 
the other hand, when the indigenous soil population of S. meliloti was high, the 
transgenic inoculant strain was found in only 6 % of nodules. In fact, in several 
other studies where rhizobia strains had been genetically modified in an effort to 
improve their symbiotic traits, in the field, those strains appeared to be less com-
petitive than indigenous strains. While this result may be reassuring to those indi-
viduals who fear that introduced transgenic strains will take over from naturally 
occurring strains in the environment, it may not bode well for using genetically 
manipulated strains to improve crop yields in the field. It has been suggested that 
the decreased competitiveness of transgenic rhizobial strains may be, at least in 
part, a consequence of the metabolic load created by the expression of the intro-
duced transgene(s).

8.2  Metabolic Load
The introduction and expression of foreign DNA in a host bacterium typically 
changes the metabolism of the bacterium with the result that its environmental 
functioning may be altered to a significant extent (Fig.  8.2). This phenomenon, 
which is a multifaceted biological response, is due to a metabolic load (also called 
a metabolic burden or metabolic drain) that is imposed upon the host by the for-
eign DNA and the proteins/functions that it encodes. A metabolic load can occur 
for a variety of reasons, including the following.
• An increasing copy number of the foreign gene(s) requires increasing amounts 
of cellular energy for its replication and maintenance. If the foreign gene(s) is 
on a plasmid, the transformed bacterium will also need to expend energy and 
resources to maintain and replicate the plasmid, with larger plasmids and multi-
copy number plasmids requiring more of the cell’s resources.
• Overproduction of both the introduced encoded target protein(s) as well as any 
marker proteins (often a part of the vector) may deplete the cellular pools of 
certain aminoacyl–tRNAs (or even certain amino acids) and/or drain the host 
cell of its energy (in the form of ATP or GTP). Protein synthesis is an extremely 
energy-intensive and resource-intensive process. Thus, the synthesis of foreign 
proteins may impair the ability of the host bacterium to perform its normal 
metabolic functions, including processes related to its ability to stimulate plant 
growth.
• When a foreign protein is overexpressed and then exported from the cytoplasm 
to the cell membrane, the periplasm, or the external medium, it may “jam”

ing the introduction and expression of foreign genes

232
8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
cellular export sites and thereby prevent the proper localization of other, essen-
tial host cell proteins, again impairing the bacterium’s PGPB activity.
• Host cells with unusual metabolic features, such as an exceptionally high natu-
ral rate of respiration, e.g., Azotobacter spp., are more likely to be affected by 
these perturbations than are other host cells. Thus, the introduction of foreign 
genes into Azotobacter spp. and the subsequent expression of those genes can 
readily debilitate this bacterium, e.g., making it difficult for the transgenic bac-
terium to fix nitrogen.
One of the most commonly observed consequences of a metabolic load is a 
decrease in the rate of cell growth (especially on minimal media) after the intro-
duction of foreign DNA. Sometimes, a metabolic load may result in plasmid-con-
taining cells losing all or a portion of the plasmid DNA—if the introduced gene is 
on the plasmid that is lost, this completely negates the effect of the genetic modi-
fication. Even in the laboratory, in the presence of selective pressure, all or part of 
a recombinant gene may be deleted from the plasmid. Since cells growing in the 
presence of a metabolic load generally have a decreased level of energy for cellu-
lar functions, energy-intensive metabolic processes, such as nitrogen fixation and 
protein synthesis, are invariably adversely affected by a metabolic load. A meta-
bolic load may also lead to changes in the host cell size and shape and to increases 
in the amount of extracellular polysaccharide produced by the bacterial host cell. 
This additional extracellular carbohydrate can cause the cells to stick together, 
thereby decreasing their ability to bind to plant roots and seeds.
When a particular aminoacyl–tRNA becomes limiting, as can become the case 
when a foreign protein or selectable maker (of a different genus and species) is 
overexpressed, there is an increased probability that an incorrect amino acid will 
be inserted in place of the limiting amino acid. In addition, translational accuracy, 
which depends upon the availability of GTP as part of a cellular proofreading mech-
anism, may be further decreased as a consequence of a metabolic load from foreign 
protein expression. This frequency of errors may diminish the usefulness of the pro-
teins encoded by the host bacterium potentially abolishing its usefulness as a PGPB.
The extent of the metabolic load may be reduced by avoiding the use of (generally 
multi-copy) plasmid vectors, instead integrating the introduced foreign DNA directly 
into the chromosomal DNA of the host organism (Fig. 8.3). Plasmids are often unsta-
ble, especially the relatively small plasmids that have been developed to be practical 
for cloning, and there is a risk of losing the plasmid, and thus the introduced trait, in the 
absence of selective pressure (which is generally not possible to apply in the field). With 
an integrated cloned gene, without a plasmid vector, foreign genes are stably main-
tained; problems caused by metabolic load are usually avoided because a single copy 
of the foreign gene per chromosome typically results in only a low to moderate level 
of foreign gene expression and the transformed host cell does not waste its resources 
synthesizing unwanted and unneeded selectable marker-encoded proteins. In addition, 
when the codon usage of the foreign gene is different from the codon usage of the host 
organism, depletion of specific aminoacyl–tRNA pools may be lessened by chemically 
synthesizing the target gene to better reflect the codon usage of the host organism.

233
Incorporation of a foreign gene into a bacterial chromosome is generally 
achieved by use of either transposition of mobile genetic elements or by homolo-
gous recombination. Naturally occurring mobile genetic elements, or transposons, 
can be modified to carry a target gene along with the essential transposase gene 
(responsible for inserting the transposon into the chromosomal DNA) between two 
short terminal sequences required for transposition into a bacterial chromosome.

gene into the chromosomal DNA of a host PGPB

234
8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
However, transposons by their nature are generally unstable, being able to move 
within the genome and insert into new positions irrespective of DNA sequence. In 
addition, they are readily transferred to other bacteria in the rhizosphere.
Stable incorporation of foreign genes into the chromosome by homologous 
recombination relies on hybridization and strand exchange between two homolo-
gous sequences of DNA (Fig. 8.3). First, a reporter (marker) gene, contained on 
a non-replicating plasmid, is inserted into a non-essential region of the chromo-
somal DNA by homologous recombination. Transformants with the marker gene 
are selected based on the activity encoded by the marker gene. The plasmid is lost 
as it cannot replicate in the host cells. Then, the same non-essential chromosomal 
DNA sequence, also contained on a non-replicating plasmid, is disrupted with 
the foreign (target) gene under the control of an appropriate promoter. Following 
transformation of a PGPB containing the marker gene with this construct, one can 
select for the replacement of the marker gene by the target gene on the chromo-
some by assaying for the loss of expression of the marker gene.
8.3  Patenting
For a company endeavoring to produce PGPB products for economic gain, it is impor-
tant that the results of its often expensive research efforts can be legally protected 
from competitors. One strategy that meets this objective is for the government to grant 
inventors exclusive rights to the novel products or processes that they develop. These 
intellectual property rights include trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and patents. 
Trade secrets comprise private information about specific technical procedures and for-
mulations that a company wishes to keep secret from all others. Copyrights protect the 
authorship of published works from unauthorized use. Trademarks can be either words 
or symbols that identify a particular product or process of one company.
For the biotechnology industry including companies developing new and better 
PGPB, patents are often perceived to be the most important form of intellectual 
property (Fig. 8.4). A patent is a legal document in which the government of a 
particular country (or group of countries such as the EU) gives the patent holder 
exclusive rights to implement the described invention commercially. Moreover, 
depending on the claims of the patent that has been approved by a government 
agency (in the United States the Patent and Trademarks Office or PTO), the patent 
holder can develop other products that are directly derived from the original inven-
tion. Once a patent has been granted, competitors have to license the right to use a 
patented invention in order to develop a product based on it. By definition, a pat-
ent is a public document that must contain a detailed description of the invention 
that informs others about the nature and limits of the invention, allowing them to 
decide whether they should continue working in a particular direction or try to use 
the patented invention as a springboard to other possible innovations.
While patents serve a similar function throughout the world, patent decisions 
and laws can vary significantly from one country to another. The duration of the 

235
exclusive rights of a patent is 20 years from the date that the application is filed, in 
all countries. In the discussion of patents and patenting that follows key terms that 
are specific to the patenting process are underlined.
In the United States, the applicant who was the first to invent is awarded the 
patent. For an individual to prove that he/she have the first date of invention, it is 
essential to keep detailed signed (including witnessed) and dated notebooks detail-
ing the work in the invention or discovery process. When more than one person 
or group tries to patent an invention, it is necessary for the applicants to prove 
that they developed the claimed invention first. In almost all other countries, a pat-
ent is awarded to the applicant who filed first (first-to-file principle). It often takes 
several years following the filing of the initial patent application before a patent is 
granted. During that time, the patent application is scrutinized by examiners from 
a government agency (patent office) to ensure that it meets all of the established 
criteria for the patent to be granted. Currently, approximately 200–300,000 US 
patents are issued every year (although prior to 2010 only about half this num-
ber were issued per year). Approximately 15–25,000 of the patents that are issued 
each year are in the general area of biotechnology, with between 5 and 25 patents 
per year relating to some aspect of plant–microbe interaction. Since the beginning 
of the US patent system, which began at the end of the eighteenth century, more 
than 9 million US patents have been issued. Because the holding of a patent can 
be of considerable economic value, it is not a trivial matter to receive one. For this 
reason, both the patent application and the invention must meet a very strict set of 
criteria.
Generally, for either an invention (a product or a process) to be patentable, it 
must satisfy a number of requirements:
1.	 The invention, after having been shown to work (reduced to practice), must be 
novel meaning that the invention does not exist as another patent that is held 
by someone else in another country; is not an existing product or process, and,

some key elements of the 
patent process

236

outside the United States, has not appeared in some published form before the 
submission of the patent application. In the United States, an inventor has one 
year following a publication describing the invention in which to apply for a 
patent.
2.	 A patent cannot be granted for something that was merely previously unknown, 
i.e., a discovery; rather, the invention must contain, as judged by the patent office, 
an inventive step that was not obvious to other workers who are skilled in the 
field of the invention.
3.	 The invention must be useful in some way, whether it is a process, a com-
pound, a microorganism, or a multi-cellular organism.
4.	 Every patent application must contain a description of the invention that is suf-
ficiently thorough and detailed that a person knowledgeable in the same field 
can implement it.
A patent cannot be granted for anything that is considered to be a product of 
nature. This prevents individuals from gaining a monopoly for something that 
occurs naturally and has merely been discovered (and not invented) and there-
fore belongs to the public. This constraint is often quite contentious. In the United 
States, according to the Supreme Court, virtually “anything under the sun that is 
made by man” is patentable. However, in many other jurisdictions, this is not the 
case. Often, companies and individuals try to skirt this constraint. For example, 
instead of applying for a patent on human insulin, a company might apply for a 
patent on the production of human insulin in a bacterial cell.
In the United States, a patent application is dealt with as follows. The applica-
tion is typically prepared by an expert, normally a patent lawyer, in consultation 
with the inventor/scientist. The application is required to have a title; an abstract 
briefly describing the nature of the application; a section on the background of 
the invention that includes an extensive description of the current state of the art 
in the field of the invention; a detailed summary of the invention with, if consid-
ered helpful, figures and tables (similar to what might be included in a scientific 
publication); sections that explain the nature of the invention and describe how 
the invention works; and, finally, a list of claims about the invention and how the 
invention may be used. The application is sent to the PTO, where it is reviewed by 
an examiner for novelty, non-obviousness, utility, feasibility, and general accept-
ability as a patentable invention.
If a patent examiner agrees that the invention meets all the criteria for patent-
ability, then a patent is awarded. Protection of patent rights is the responsibility 
of the patent holder, and generally, that means bringing a lawsuit(s) against those 
who are presumed to be infringing on the patent (i.e., using the protected inven-
tion without explicit permission). For an individual or company to use a patented 
invention, they must often pay a licensing fee (an agreement between a patent 
holder and another individual or company who is authorized to use the invention 
in exchange for an agreed payment). When any disputes arise regarding patent 
infringement or if a person or company feels that an awarded patent is inappropri-
ate, the courts and not the patent office adjudicate these disputes.

237
If a patent examiner rejects a patent application, then the applicant can appeal 
the decision to a Patent Appeals Board. If this appeal is turned down, then the 
decision can be challenged legally. There are a number of cases in which the 
stakes are considered to be so high that costly court battles go on for many years.
Product patents and process patents are the two major categories of patents. As 
the names suggest, product patents deal with homogeneous substances, complex 
mixtures, and various devices, while process patents include preparative proce-
dures, methodologies, or actual uses (Table 8.4). The patenting of microbiologi-
cal and biotechnological inventions is based on the historical experience of the 
agricultural, fermentation, pharmaceutical, and medical industries. For example, 
in 1873, Louis Pasteur, arguably the father of modern microbiology, received two 
patents (US patents 135,245 and 141,072) for a process for fermenting beer. These 
patents included the living organism (i.e., the particular strains of yeast) used in 
the process. Thus, based on this historical precedent, there should be no particu-
lar impediment to the patenting in the USA of living organisms. Nevertheless, 
more recently, when a scientist attempted, for the first time, to patent in the USA 
a genetically modified bacterium, the case became extremely controversial. In 
that instance, Dr. Ananda Chakrabarty, who at the time worked for the General 
Electric Corporation, engineered various strains of Pseudomonas spp. by trans-
ferring (by bacterial conjugation) different naturally occurring plasmids, each of 
which carried the genes for a separate hydrocarbon degradative pathway, from 
one bacterium to another. The net result of this work was that Dr. Chakrabarty 
and his colleagues eventually developed a genetically modified bacterium which 
was capable of breaking down a number of different components of crude oil. 
Notwithstanding its potential usefulness in cleaning up oil spills, the US PTO 
rejected the patent application for the final engineered bacterium on the grounds

that microorganisms are products of nature and, as living things, are not patent-
able. Following an unsuccessful appeal to the US Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences, the US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals overturned the original 
decision. Following protracted legal maneuvering, in 1980, in the case of Diamond 
versus Chakrabarty, in a 5–4 landmark decision, the US Supreme Court decided 
that this engineered microorganism was patentable according to the US Patent 
Statute, arguing that “a live, human-made microorganism is patentable subject 
matter…as a manufacture or composition of matter.”
The argument against patenting this genetically engineered microorganism 
tended to center on how the organism was developed. In the past, induced muta-
tion followed by selection for novel properties was an acceptable way to create a 
patentable living organism. However, genetic engineering was considered by some 
to be “tampering with nature.” Consequently, it was argued that no inventor should 
benefit from manipulating “products of nature.” This position was not upheld. 
Thus, in the United States from 1980 onward, and later in other countries, organ-
isms, regardless of the means that were used to develop them, must be judged by 
the standard criteria of novelty, non-obviousness, and utility to determine whether 
they are patentable. In his decision, the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, 
Warren Burger, argued that Congress had intended patentable subject matter to 
“include anything under the sun that is made by man,” he concluded that, “Judged 
in this light, respondent’s micro-organism plainly qualifies as patentable subject 
matter. His claim is… to a non-naturally occurring manufacture or composition of 
matter—a product of human ingenuity.”
8.3.1  Patenting in Different Countries
Generally, the rights given by a patent extend only throughout the country 
in which the patent application was filed. Relatively recently (late 2012), the 
European Parliament has agreed on legislation to enable the establishment of a 
“unitary patent.” This type of patent would be valid in participating member states 
of the EU and would replace the current need for the validation of a European pat-
ent in each of the individual countries concerned. When it comes into effect (this is 
expected to happen some time in 2015 or 2016), the unitary patent will mean that 
applicants will pay a single renewal fee, and a single court will deal with all pat-
ent issues within the EU. In addition, unitary patents will be accepted in English, 
French, or German with no further translation into any other languages required. 
All EU member states, except for Spain, Croatia, and Italy, have opted to join in 
this venture. However, before this legislation can officially take effect, its legality 
has been challenged by Spain and the case is still pending before the European 
Court of Justice (as of late 2014). From an outside perspective, this dispute, over a 
process which should simplify patenting in the EU, seems very much like the tra-
ditional concerns of some member countries over individual national sovereignty 
versus what is perceived to be the common good of all of the EU member nations.

239
Some countries, notably the USA, permit patent claims to be relatively broad so 
that it may be possible to claim chemicals or microorganisms or devices that are 
similar but not identical to the ones described in detail in the patent application. 
Other countries, such as Japan, permit only narrow claims and require each claim 
to be more extensively documented and proven. As a result, between countries 
there are somewhat divergent views about what is or is not a patentable invention. 
As well, patent protection might require several smaller and more specific patents 
in Japan to protect the same invention(s) that might be described in a single broad 
omnibus US patent.
8.3.2  Patenting DNA Sequences
At present, isolated nucleic acid sequences, whether DNA, RNA, or cDNA, and 
proteins are generally patentable. Although most of these sequences are found nat-
urally in organisms, purification from their natural state is considered sufficient 
to render them patentable. Since the US Supreme Court decision in the case of 
Diamond versus Chakrabarty in 1980, thousands of patent applications for whole 
genes have been approved by patent offices throughout the world. In the USA, 
almost 20  % of human genes have been patented. Many of the patented gene 
sequences are used as diagnostic probes.
During the course of the sequencing of the human genome, researchers isolated 
and determined the sequence of hundreds of human cDNAs. In some instances, 
these cDNAs were of sufficient length to encode a complete protein, while in other 
instances the isolated cDNAs encoded only a portion of a protein. Beginning in 
1991, several attempts were made to patent these cDNAs notwithstanding the 
fact that researchers did not know what protein(s) they encoded. In these patent 
applications, it was argued that any human cDNA would (by definition) encode a 
human protein and that such a protein would likely be an important component of 
human development or metabolism. However, these patent applications were all 
rejected based on the fact that the utility of these DNA sequences had not been 
demonstrated.
One problematic case of patenting a human gene revolves around the company 
Myriad Genetics (based in the state of Utah in the USA) who claimed methods to 
detect mutations in the human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 to diagnose a predisposi-
tion to breast cancer. The objections to the patent were based on the fact that genes 
occur naturally in every human. In addition, it was suggested that (in this case) 
patenting would constitute an obstacle to biomedical research worldwide. Another 
objection to this patent related to the fact that the discovery of the relevance of 
these genes to breast cancer was funded by the public.
Following a complex series of court cases and considerable legal maneuver-
ing, the case of Myriad Genetics came before the US Supreme Court. On June 13, 
2013, the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, “A naturally occurring DNA 
segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been 
8.3  Patenting

240
8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
isolated,” thereby invalidating Myriad’s patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. 
However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not 
found in nature, such as a strand of synthetically produced cDNA, could still be 
eligible for patent protection. There is now, admittedly, some confusion within 
both the scientific and legal communities regarding precisely what is and what is 
not patentable.
8.3.3  Patenting Multicellular Organisms
The patenting of multi-cellular organisms raises a number of ethical and social 
concerns. However, there is nothing intrinsically new about the patenting of liv-
ing material. As mentioned above, Louis Pasteur patented living microorganisms 
more than 100  years ago. Moreover, specific laws that give plant breeders the 
right to own various plant varieties have been enacted in the USA and elsewhere. 
The transgenic mouse (“OncoMouse”) that carries a gene that makes it suscep-
tible to tumor formation has been a precedent-setting case in many jurisdictions 
to determine whether genetically modified animals (in addition to microorganisms 
and plants) are patentable. Currently, patenting of genetically modified animals 
is sanctioned in many developed countries, including the USA, the EU, Japan, 
Australia, and New Zealand. However, in other countries such as Canada, it is still 
not possible to patent a transgenic animal.
8.3.4  Patenting and Fundamental Research
Before the development of modern biotechnology, patenting and patent enforce-
ment were rarely of interest to academic researchers working in the biological sci-
ences. However, since the decision handed down by the US Supreme Court in 1980 
in the case of Diamond versus Chakrabarty, there is a view held by some within 
the academic scientific community that patents and the consequences of patenting 
may be detrimental to what are perceived to be established scientific values. Prior 
to 1980, university-based scientific research was largely perceived to be an open 
system with a free exchange of ideas and materials through publications and per-
sonal communications. However, with the development of the science of biotech-
nology and the subsequent monetization of biological science, some scientists feel 
that the integrity of scientific inquiry has become secondary to self-interest. At the 
present time, public recognition and potential financial gain from innovations have 
become prime motivations for many individual scientists. In the past, there was a 
tendency to avoid secrecy in basic research. On the other hand, today, biological 
scientists are often advised by patent lawyers (many of whom are in the employ of 
universities) to keep their work secret (at least) until a patent application is filed. 
In the past, it was considered to be standard practice for scientists to readily share 

241
both naturally occurring and mutant strains of organisms with one another. Today, 
it is not uncommon for researchers to insist that “Material Transfer Agreements” 
that clearly spell out the ownership of the organisms being shared, and the exclu-
sive rights to develop these organisms for commercial purposes, are signed before 
any microbial strains or isolated genes are shared with colleagues.
As a consequence of the chronic financial constraints that have been imposed 
on basic research in many developed countries, nonprofit institutions, and espe-
cially universities, have sought additional forms of revenue. In most universi-
ties, as a condition of employment, faculty members are required to assign the 
rights of their inventions to their university employer), with some portion of the 
financial reward (royalty income) that might accrue from the successful develop-
ment and commercialization of any scientific invention often being shared by the 
university with the scientist inventor. Licensing fees and royalties from patents 
are currently seen by university administrators as a potential source of income. 
For example, US patent #4,237,224 (Fig.  8.5), was granted to Stanley Cohen 
(of Stanford University) and Herbert Boyer (then working at the University of 
California at San Francisco) in 1980 for the process of recombinant DNA tech-
nology for both the use of viral and plasmid vectors and the cloning of foreign 
genes. During the lifetime of this patent, from 1980 to 1997, about $45 million 
in royalty payments were earned for Stanford University and the University of 
California. These funds accrued from the yearly licensing fees charged by these 
two universities to the companies using this technology as part of the companies’ 
efforts to develop commercial and profitable products. In addition, scientists and 
engineers employed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology typically file 
more than 100 patents annually in all research fields (including many in biologi-
cal science) and generate about $5.5 million per year from licensing the patent 
rights to these inventions.
One notable exception to the requirement to assign patent rights to the uni-
versity employer of many researcher has been promulgated by the University of 
Waterloo in Canada. There, official University of Waterloo policy states that “it

8  Issues Regarding the Use of PGPB
is University policy that ownership of rights in intellectual property (IP) created 
in the course of teaching and research activities belong to the creator(s).” In this 
model of dealing with intellectual property, it is up to the inventor to decide how 
to develop their invention, either on their own or in partnership with the univer-
sity. As a direct consequence of this (some would say enlightened) policy, more 
than 500 spin-off companies have been developed as a result of research at the 
University of Waterloo with a tremendous benefit to the local economy and often 
a benefit to the university as well. The vast majority of research-active universi-
ties have established patent policies and have technology offices that facilitate both 
patenting and the transfer of technology, at a price, to industry. Clearly, entrepre-
neurial activity has become a fact of life at most research-intensive universities 
throughout the world. The challenge is to prevent this legitimate technology trans-
fer function from dominating all aspects of academia.
Questions
	 1.	 What factors need to be considered before deliberately releasing PGPB to the 
environment?
	 2.	 Why are transgenic PGPB, including rhizobia, often found to be not espe-
cially competitive with indigenous soil bacteria?
	 3.	 What is metabolic load and how might it affect the functioning of a PGPB?
	 4.	 How can one produce transgenic PGPB while keeping the effect of metabolic 
load to a minimum?
	 5.	 How can foreign genes be integrated into the chromosomal DNA of a host 
PGPB?
	 6.	 What is a patent and why is it useful?
	 7.	 What are the criteria for deciding whether something is patentable?
	 8.	 What sorts of changes might one need to make when patenting the same 
invention in two different jurisdictions such as the USA and Japan?
	 9.	 Why is it difficult to patent complete or partial DNA sequences when the 
function that these sequences encode is unknown?
	10.	 Why is patenting of scientific discoveries good (or bad) for the further devel-
opment of science?
	11.	 Is it better for a university or for a researcher/inventor to own the rights to 
inventions made during the course of research activities at the University?
