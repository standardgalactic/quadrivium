Preface
You may be wondering why we chose a photo of NASA’s Mars Rover
for the cover. We actually chose it for several reasons. Obviously, it is
very exciting; in fact, space represents the most exciting frontier for
the entire world! In addition, much of the Rover itself consists of all
kinds of circuits. Circuits that must work without needing maintenance!
Once you are on Mars, it is hard to ﬁnd a technician!
The Rover must have a power system that can supply all the power
necessary to move it, help it collect samples and analyze them, broadcast
the results back to Earth, and receive instructions from Earth. One of the
important issues that make the problem of working with the rover is that
it takes about 20 minutes for communications to go from the Earth to
Mars. So the Rover does not make changes required by NASA quickly.
What we ﬁnd most amazing is that such a sophisticated and com-
plicated electro-mechanical device can operate so accurately and reli-
ably after ﬂying millions of miles and being bounced onto the ground!
Here is a link to an absolutely incredible video of what the Rover is
all about and how it got to Mars: http://www.youtube.com/

Features
New to This Edition
A model for magnetic coupling is presented in Chapter 13 that will make
analysis easier as well as enhance your ability to ﬁnd errors. We have suc-
cessfully used this model for years and felt it was now time to add it to
the book. In addition, there are over 600 new end-of-chapter problems,
changed end-of-chapter problems, and changed practice problems.
We have also added National Instruments MultisimTM solutions for
almost all of the problems solved using PSpice®. There is a Multisim
tutorial available on our website. We have added National Instruments
Multisim since it is very user-friendly with many more options for
analysis than PSpice. In addition, it allows the ability to modify circuits
easily in order to see how changing circuit parameters impacts voltages,
currents, and power. We have also moved the tutorials for PSpice, MAT-
LAB®, and KCIDE to our website to allow us to keep up with changes
in the software.
We have also added 43 new problems to Chapter 16. We did this
to enhance using the powerful s-domain analysis techniques to ﬁnding
voltages and currents in circuits.
Retained from Previous Editions
A course in circuit analysis is perhaps the ﬁrst exposure students have
to electrical engineering. This is also a place where we can enhance
some of the skills that they will later need as they learn how to design.

xii
Preface
An important part of this book is our 121 design a problem problems.
These problems were developed to enhance skills that are an important
part of the design process. We know it is not possible to fully develop
a student’s design skills in a fundamental course like circuits. To fully
develop design skills a student needs a design experience normally
reserved for their senior year. This does not mean that some of those
skills cannot be developed and exercised in a circuits course. The text
already included open-ended questions that help students use creativ-
ity, which is an important part of learning how to design. We already
have some questions that are open-ended but we desired to add much
more into our text in this important area and have developed an
approach to do just that. When we develop problems for the student to
solve our goal is that in solving the problem the student learns more
about the theory and the problem solving process. Why not have the
students design problems like we do? That is exactly what we do in
each chapter. Within the normal problem set, we have a set of prob-
lems where we ask the student to design a problem to help other stu-
dents better understand an important concept. This has two very
important results. The ﬁrst will be a better understanding of the basic
theory and the second will be the enhancement of some of the student’s
basic design skills. We are making effective use of the principle of
learning by teaching. Essentially we all learn better when we teach a
subject. Designing effective problems is a key part of the teaching
process. Students should also be encouraged to develop problems,
when appropriate, which have nice numbers and do not necessarily
overemphasize complicated mathematical manipulations.
A very important advantage to our textbook, we have a total of
2,447 Examples, Practice Problems, Review Questions, and End-of-
Chapter Problems! Answers are provided for all practice problems and
the odd numbered end-of-chapter problems.
The main objective of the ﬁfth edition of this book remains the
same as the previous editions—to present circuit analysis in a manner
that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other cir-
cuit textbooks, and to assist the student in beginning to see the “fun”
in engineering. This objective is achieved in the following ways:
• Chapter Openers and Summaries
Each chapter opens with a discussion about how to enhance skills
which contribute to successful problem solving as well as success-
ful careers or a career-oriented talk on a sub-discipline of electri-
cal engineering. This is followed by an introduction that links the
chapter with the previous chapters and states the chapter objectives.
The chapter ends with a summary of key points and formulas.
• Problem-Solving Methodology
Chapter 1 introduces a six-step method for solving circuit prob-
lems which is used consistently throughout the book and media
supplements to promote best-practice problem-solving procedures.
• Student-Friendly Writing Style
All principles are presented in a lucid, logical, step-by-step man-
ner. As much as possible, we avoid wordiness and giving too much
detail that could hide concepts and impede overall understanding
of the material.

Preface
xiii
• Boxed Formulas and Key Terms
Important formulas are boxed as a means of helping students sort
out what is essential from what is not. Also, to ensure that students
clearly understand the key elements of the subject matter, key
terms are deﬁned and highlighted.
• Margin Notes
Marginal notes are used as a pedagogical aid. They serve multiple
uses such as hints, cross-references, more exposition, warnings,
reminders not to make some particular common mistakes, and
problem-solving insights.
• Worked Examples
Thoroughly worked examples are liberally given at the end of
every section. The examples are regarded as a part of the text and
are clearly explained without asking the reader to ﬁll in missing
steps. Thoroughly worked examples give students a good under-
standing of the solution process and the conﬁdence to solve prob-
lems themselves. Some of the problems are solved in two or three
different ways to facilitate a substantial comprehension of the sub-
ject material as well as a comparison of different approaches.
• Practice Problems
To give students practice opportunity, each illustrative example is
immediately followed by a practice problem with the answer. The
student can follow the example step-by-step to aid in the solution
of the practice problem without ﬂipping pages or looking at the
end of the book for answers. The practice problem is also intended
to test a student’s understanding of the preceding example. It will
reinforce their grasp of the material before the student can move
on to the next section. Complete solutions to the practice problems
are available to students on the website.
• Application Sections
The last section in each chapter is devoted to practical application
aspects of the concepts covered in the chapter. The material cov-
ered in the chapter is applied to at least one or two practical prob-
lems or devices. This helps students see how the concepts are
applied to real-life situations.
• Review Questions
Ten review questions in the form of multiple-choice objective
items are provided at the end of each chapter with answers. The
review questions are intended to cover the little “tricks” that the
examples and end-of-chapter problems may not cover. They serve
as a self test device and help students determine how well they
have mastered the chapter.
• Computer Tools
In recognition of the requirements by ABET® on integrating
computer tools, the use of PSpice, Multisim, MATLAB, KCIDE for
Circuits, and developing design skills are encouraged in a student-
friendly manner. PSpice is covered early on in the text so that stu-
dents can become familiar and use it throughout the text. Tutorials
on all of these are available on our website. MATLAB is also intro-
duced early in the book.

• Design a Problem Problems
Finally, design a problem problems are meant to help the student
develop skills that will be needed in the design process.
• Historical Tidbits
Historical sketches throughout the text provide proﬁles of impor-
tant pioneers and events relevant to the study of electrical
engineering.
• Early Op Amp Discussion
The operational ampliﬁer (op amp) as a basic element is introduced
early in the text.
• Fourier and Laplace Transforms Coverage
To ease the transition between the circuit course and signals and
systems courses, Fourier and Laplace transforms are covered
lucidly and thoroughly. The chapters are developed in a manner
that the interested instructor can go from solutions of ﬁrst-order
circuits to Chapter 15. This then allows a very natural progression
from Laplace to Fourier to AC.
• Four Color Art Program
An interior design and four color art program bring circuit drawings
to life and enhance key pedagogical elements throughout the text.
• Extended Examples
Examples worked in detail according to the six-step problem solv-
ing method provide a roadmap for students to solve problems in a
consistent fashion. At least one example in each chapter is devel-
oped in this manner.
• EC 2000 Chapter Openers
Based on ABET’s skill-based CRITERION 3, these chapter open-
ers are devoted to discussions as to how students can acquire the
skills that will lead to a signiﬁcantly enhanced career as an engi-
neer. Because these skills are so very important to the student
while still in college as well after graduation, we use the heading,
“Enhancing your Skills and your Career.”
• Homework Problems
There are 468 new or changed end-of-chapter problems which will
provide students with plenty of practice as well as reinforce key
concepts.
• Homework Problem Icons
Icons are used to highlight problems that relate to engineering
design as well as problems that can be solved using PSpice, Mul-
tisim, KCIDE, or MATLAB.
Organization
This book was written for a two-semester or three-quarter course in
linear circuit analysis. The book may also be used for a one-semester
course by a proper selection of chapters and sections by the instructor.
It is broadly divided into three parts.
• Part 1, consisting of Chapters 1 to 8, is devoted to dc circuits. It
covers the fundamental laws and theorems, circuits techniques, and
passive and active elements.

Preface

• Part 2, which contains Chapter 9 to 14, deals with ac circuits. It
introduces phasors, sinusoidal steady-state analysis, ac power, rms
values, three-phase systems, and frequency response.
• Part 3, consisting of Chapters 15 to 19, are devoted to advanced
techniques for network analysis. It provides students with a solid
introduction to the Laplace transform, Fourier series, Fourier trans-
form, and two-port network analysis.
The material in the three parts is more than sufﬁcient for a two-semester
course, so the instructor must select which chapters or sections to cover.
Sections marked with the dagger sign (†) may be skipped, explained
brieﬂy, or assigned as homework. They can be omitted without loss of
continuity. Each chapter has plenty of problems grouped according to
the sections of the related material and diverse enough that the instruc-
tor can choose some as examples and assign some as homework. As
stated earlier, we are using three icons with this edition. We are using
to denote problems that either require PSpice in the solution
process, where the circuit complexity is such that PSpice or Multisim
would make the solution process easier, and where PSpice or Multisim
makes a good check to see if the problem has been solved correctly.
We are using 
to denote problems where MATLAB is required in the
solution process, where MATLAB makes sense because of the problem
makeup and its complexity, and where MATLAB makes a good check
to see if the problem has been solved correctly. Finally, we use 
to identify problems that help the student develop skills that are needed
for engineering design. More difﬁcult problems are marked with an
asterisk (*).
Comprehensive problems follow the end-of-chapter problems. They
are mostly applications problems that require skills learned from that
particular chapter.
Prerequisites
As with most introductory circuit courses, the main prerequisites, for
a course using this textbook, are physics and calculus. Although famil-
iarity with complex numbers is helpful in the later part of the book, it
is not required. A very important asset of this text is that ALL the math-
ematical equations and fundamentals of physics needed by the student,
are included in the text.

A Note to the Student
This may be your ﬁrst course in electrical engineering. Although elec-
trical engineering is an exciting and challenging discipline, the course
may intimidate you. This book was written to prevent that. A good text-
book and a good professor are an advantage—but you are the one who
does the learning. If you keep the following ideas in mind, you will do
very well in this course.
• This course is the foundation on which most other courses in the
electrical engineering curriculum rest. For this reason, put in as
much effort as you can. Study the course regularly.
• Problem solving is an essential part of the learning process. Solve as
many problems as you can. Begin by solving the practice problem
following each example, and then proceed to the end-of-chapter prob-
lems. The best way to learn is to solve a lot of problems. An aster-
isk in front of a problem indicates a challenging problem.
• Spice and Multisim, computer circuit analysis programs, are used
throughout the textbook. PSpice, the personal computer version of
Spice, is the popular standard circuit analysis program at most uni-
versities. PSpice for Windows and Multisim are described on our
website. Make an effort to learn PSpice and/or Multisim, because
you can check any circuit problem with them and be sure you are
handing in a correct problem solution.
• MATLAB is another software that is very useful in circuit analysis
and other courses you will be taking. A brief tutorial on MATLAB
can be found on our website. The best way to learn MATLAB is
to start working with it once you know a few commands.
• Each chapter ends with a section on how the material covered in
the chapter can be applied to real-life situations. The concepts in
this section may be new and advanced to you. No doubt, you will
learn more of the details in other courses. We are mainly interested
in gaining a general familiarity with these ideas.
• Attempt the review questions at the end of each chapter. They 
will help you discover some “tricks” not revealed in class or in the
textbook.
• Clearly a lot of effort has gone into making the technical details in
this book easy to understand. It also contains all the mathematics
and physics necessary to understand the theory and will be very
useful in your other engineering courses. However, we have also
focused on creating a reference for you to use both in school as
well as when working in industry or seeking a graduate degree.
• It is very tempting to sell your book after you have completed your
classroom experience; however, our advice to you is DO NOT SELL
YOUR ENGINEERING BOOKS! Books have always been expen-
sive; however, the cost of this book is virtually the same as I paid
for my circuits text back in the early 60s in terms of real dollars. In
xix

fact, it is actually cheaper. In addition, engineering books of the
past are nowhere near as complete as what is available now.
When I was a student, I did not sell any of my engineering text-
books and was very glad I did not! I found that I needed most of them
throughout my career.
A short review on ﬁnding determinants is covered in Appendix A,
complex numbers in Appendix B, and mathematical formulas in Appen-
dix C. Answers to odd-numbered problems are given in Appendix D.
Have fun!

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.a), “an ability to apply knowledge
of mathematics, science, and engineering.”
As students, you are required to study mathematics, science, and engi-
neering with the purpose of being able to apply that knowledge to the
solution of engineering problems. The skill here is the ability to apply
the fundamentals of these areas in the solution of a problem. So how
do you develop and enhance this skill?
The best approach is to work as many problems as possible in all
of your courses. However, if you are really going to be successful with
this, you must spend time analyzing where and when and why you have
difﬁculty in easily arriving at successful solutions. You may be sur-
prised to learn that most of your problem-solving problems are with
mathematics rather than your understanding of theory. You may also
learn that you start working the problem too soon. Taking time to think
about the problem and how you should solve it will always save you
time and frustration in the end.
What I have found that works best for me is to apply our six-
step problem-solving technique. Then I carefully identify the areas
where I have difﬁculty solving the problem. Many times, my actual
deﬁciencies are in my understanding and ability to use correctly cer-
tain mathematical principles. I then return to my fundamental math
texts and carefully review the appropriate sections, and in some cases,
work some example problems in that text. This brings me to another
important thing you should always do: Keep nearby all your basic
mathematics, science, and engineering textbooks.
This process of continually looking up material you thought you
had acquired in earlier courses may seem very tedious at ﬁrst; how-
ever, as your skills develop and your knowledge increases, this process
will become easier and easier. On a personal note, it is this very process
that led me from being a much less than average student to someone
who could earn a Ph.D. and become a successful researcher.

Introduction
Electric circuit theory and electromagnetic theory are the two funda-
mental theories upon which all branches of electrical engineering are
built. Many branches of electrical engineering, such as power, electric
machines, control, electronics, communications, and instrumentation,
are based on electric circuit theory. Therefore, the basic electric circuit
theory course is the most important course for an electrical engineer-
ing student, and always an excellent starting point for a beginning stu-
dent in electrical engineering education. Circuit theory is also valuable
to students specializing in other branches of the physical sciences
because circuits are a good model for the study of energy systems in
general, and because of the applied mathematics, physics, and topol-
ogy involved.
In electrical engineering, we are often interested in communicating
or transferring energy from one point to another. To do this requires an
interconnection of electrical devices. Such interconnection is referred
to as an electric circuit, and each component of the circuit is known as
an element.
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements.
A simple electric circuit is shown in Fig. 1.1. It consists of three
basic elements: a battery, a lamp, and connecting wires. Such a simple
circuit can exist by itself; it has several applications, such as a ﬂash-
light, a search light, and so forth.
A complicated real circuit is displayed in Fig. 1.2, representing the
schematic diagram for a radio receiver. Although it seems complicated,
this circuit can be analyzed using the techniques we cover in this book.
Our goal in this text is to learn various analytical techniques and
computer software applications for describing the behavior of a circuit
like this.

Electric circuits are used in numerous electrical systems to accom-
plish different tasks. Our objective in this book is not the study of
various uses and applications of circuits. Rather, our major concern is
the analysis of the circuits. By the analysis of a circuit, we mean a
study of the behavior of the circuit: How does it respond to a given
input? How do the interconnected elements and devices in the circuit
interact?
We commence our study by deﬁning some basic concepts. These
concepts include charge, current, voltage, circuit elements, power, and
energy. Before deﬁning these concepts, we must ﬁrst establish a sys-
tem of units that we will use throughout the text.
Systems of Units
As electrical engineers, we deal with measurable quantities. Our mea-
surement, however, must be communicated in a standard language that
virtually all professionals can understand, irrespective of the country
where the measurement is conducted. Such an international measurement
language is the International System of Units (SI), adopted by the
General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. In this system,
there are seven principal units from which the units of all other phys-
ical quantities can be derived. Table 1.1 shows the six units and one
derived unit that are relevant to this text. The SI units are used through-
out this text.
One great advantage of the SI unit is that it uses preﬁxes based on
the power of 10 to relate larger and smaller units to the basic unit.
Table 1.2 shows the SI preﬁxes and their symbols. For example, the
following are expressions of the same distance in meters (m):
Charge and Current
The concept of electric charge is the underlying principle for explain-
ing all electrical phenomena. Also, the most basic quantity in an elec-
tric circuit is the electric charge. We all experience the effect of electric

we mean. We will be using IEEE con-
ventions throughout this book.
charge when we try to remove our wool sweater and have it stick to
our body or walk across a carpet and receive a shock.
Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which mat-
ter consists, measured in coulombs (C).
We know from elementary physics that all matter is made of funda-
mental building blocks known as atoms and that each atom consists of
electrons, protons, and neutrons. We also know that the charge e on an
electron is negative and equal in magnitude to 
C, while
a proton carries a positive charge of the same magnitude as the elec-
tron. The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons leaves an
atom neutrally charged.
The following points should be noted about electric charge:
1. The coulomb is a large unit for charges. In 1 C of charge, there
are 
electrons. Thus realistic or
laboratory values of charges are on the order of pC, nC, or C.1
2. According to experimental observations, the only charges that
occur in nature are integral multiples of the electronic charge
3. The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither
be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Thus the algebraic sum
of the electric charges in a system does not change.
We now consider the ﬂow of electric charges. A unique feature of
electric charge or electricity is the fact that it is mobile; that is, it can
be transferred from one place to another, where it can be converted to
another form of energy.
When a conducting wire (consisting of several atoms) is con-
nected to a battery (a source of electromotive force), the charges are
compelled to move; positive charges move in one direction while neg-
ative charges move in the opposite direction. This motion of charges
creates electric current. It is conventional to take the current ﬂow as
the movement of positive charges. That is, opposite to the ﬂow of neg-
ative charges, as Fig. 1.3 illustrates. This convention was introduced
by Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), the American scientist and inven-
tor. Although we now know that current in metallic conductors is due
to negatively charged electrons, we will follow the universally
accepted convention that current is the net ﬂow of positive charges.
Thus,
Electric current is the time rate of change of charge, measured in
amperes (A).
Mathematically, the relationship between current i, charge q, and time t is

where current is measured in amperes (A), and
The charge transferred between time 
and t is obtained by integrat-
ing both sides of Eq. (1.1). We obtain
(1.2)
The way we deﬁne current as i in Eq. (1.1) suggests that current need
not be a constant-valued function. As many of the examples and prob-
lems in this chapter and subsequent chapters suggest, there can be sev-
eral types of current; that is, charge can vary with time in several ways.
If the current does not change with time, but remains constant, we
call it a direct current (dc).
A direct current (dc) is a current that remains constant with time.
By convention the symbol I is used to represent such a constant current.
A time-varying current is represented by the symbol i. A common
form of time-varying current is the sinusoidal current or alternating
current (ac).
An alternating current (ac) is a current that varies sinusoidally with time.
Such current is used in your household to run the air conditioner,
refrigerator, washing machine, and other electric appliances. Figure 1.4

Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836), a French mathematician and
physicist, laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He deﬁned the elec-
tric current and developed a way to measure it in the 1820s.
Born in Lyons, France, Ampere at age 12 mastered Latin in a few
weeks, as he was intensely interested in mathematics and many of the
best mathematical works were in Latin. He was a brilliant scientist and
a proliﬁc writer. He formulated the laws of electromagnetics. He in-
vented the electromagnet and the ammeter. The unit of electric current,
the ampere, was named after him.

shows direct current and alternating current; these are the two most
common types of current. We will consider other types later in the
book.
Once we deﬁne current as the movement of charge, we expect cur-
rent to have an associated direction of ﬂow. As mentioned earlier, the
direction of current ﬂow is conventionally taken as the direction of pos-
itive charge movement. Based on this convention, a current of 5 A may
be represented positively or negatively as shown in Fig. 1.5. In other
words, a negative current of 
A ﬂowing in one direction as shown
in Fig. 1.5(b) is the same as a current of 
A ﬂowing in the opposite
direction.

Voltage
As explained brieﬂy in the previous section, to move the electron in a
conductor in a particular direction requires some work or energy trans-
fer. This work is performed by an external electromotive force (emf),
typically represented by the battery in Fig. 1.3. This emf is also known
as voltage or potential difference. The voltage 
between two points
a and b in an electric circuit is the energy (or work) needed to move
a unit charge from a to b; mathematically,
(1.3)
where w is energy in joules (J) and q is charge in coulombs (C). The
voltage 
or simply v is measured in volts (V), named in honor of
the Italian physicist Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745–1827), who
invented the ﬁrst voltaic battery. From Eq. (1.3), it is evident that
Thus,
Voltage (or potential difference) is the energy required to move a unit
charge through an element, measured in volts (V).

Historical
Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist,
invented the electric battery—which provided the ﬁrst continuous ﬂow
of electricity—and the capacitor.
Born into a noble family in Como, Italy, Volta was performing
electrical experiments at age 18. His invention of the battery in 1796
revolutionized the use of electricity. The publication of his work in
1800 marked the beginning of electric circuit theory. Volta received
many honors during his lifetime. The unit of voltage or potential dif-
ference, the volt, was named in his honor.

volts higher than point b, or (2) the potential at point a with respect to
point b is 
. It follows logically that in general
(1.4)
For example, in Fig. 1.7, we have two representations of the same volt-
age. In Fig. 1.7(a), point a is 
V above point b; in Fig. 1.7(b), point b
is 
V above point a. We may say that in Fig. 1.7(a), there is a 9-V
voltage drop from a to b or equivalently a 9-V voltage rise from b to
a. In other words, a voltage drop from a to b is equivalent to a volt-
age rise from b to a.
Current and voltage are the two basic variables in electric circuits.
The common term signal is used for an electric quantity such as a cur-
rent or a voltage (or even electromagnetic wave) when it is used for
conveying information. Engineers prefer to call such variables signals
rather than mathematical functions of time because of their importance
in communications and other disciplines. Like electric current, a con-
stant voltage is called a dc voltage and is represented by V, whereas a
sinusoidally time-varying voltage is called an ac voltage and is repre-
sented by v. A dc voltage is commonly produced by a battery; ac volt-
age is produced by an electric generator.
Power and Energy
Although current and voltage are the two basic variables in an electric
circuit, they are not sufﬁcient by themselves. For practical purposes,
we need to know how much power an electric device can handle. We
all know from experience that a 100-watt bulb gives more light than a
60-watt bulb. We also know that when we pay our bills to the electric
utility companies, we are paying for the electric energy consumed over
a certain period of time. Thus, power and energy calculations are
important in circuit analysis.

To relate power and energy to voltage and current, we recall from
physics that:
Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in
watts (W).
We write this relationship as
(1.5)
where p is power in watts (W), w is energy in joules (J), and t is time
in seconds (s). From Eqs. (1.1), (1.3), and (1.5), it follows that
(1.6)
or
(1.7)
The power p in Eq. (1.7) is a time-varying quantity and is called the
instantaneous power. Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an ele-
ment is the product of the voltage across the element and the current
through it. If the power has a 
sign, power is being delivered to or
absorbed by the element. If, on the other hand, the power has a 
sign,
power is being supplied by the element. But how do we know when
the power has a negative or a positive sign?
Current direction and voltage polarity play a major role in deter-
mining the sign of power. It is therefore important that we pay atten-
tion to the relationship between current i and voltage v in Fig. 1.8(a).
The voltage polarity and current direction must conform with those
shown in Fig. 1.8(a) in order for the power to have a positive sign.
This is known as the passive sign convention. By the passive sign con-
vention, current enters through the positive polarity of the voltage. In
this case, 
or 
implies that the element is absorbing
power. However, if 
or 
, as in Fig. 1.8(b), the element
is releasing or supplying power.
Passive sign convention is satisﬁed when the current enters through
the positive terminal of an element and p
vi. If the current enters
through the negative terminal, p
vi.
Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the passive sign conven-
tion throughout this text. For example, the element in both circuits of
Fig. 1.9 has an absorbing power of 
W because a positive current
enters the positive terminal in both cases. In Fig. 1.10, however, the
element is supplying power of 
W because a positive current enters
the negative terminal. Of course, an absorbing power of 
W is
equivalent to a supplying power of 
W. In general,

1884 Exhibition In the United States, nothing promoted the future
of electricity like the 1884 International Electrical Exhibition. Just
imagine a world without electricity, a world illuminated by candles and
gaslights, a world where the most common transportation was by walk-
ing and riding on horseback or by horse-drawn carriage. Into this world
an exhibition was created that highlighted Thomas Edison and reﬂected
his highly developed ability to promote his inventions and products.
His exhibit featured spectacular lighting displays powered by an impres-
sive 100-kW “Jumbo” generator.
Edward Weston’s dynamos and lamps were featured in the United
States Electric Lighting Company’s display. Weston’s well known col-
lection of scientiﬁc instruments was also shown.
Other prominent exhibitors included Frank Sprague, Elihu Thompson,
and the Brush Electric Company of Cleveland. The American Institute
of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) held its ﬁrst technical meeting on Octo-
ber 7–8 at the Franklin Institute during the exhibit. AIEE merged with
the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) in 1964 to form the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Circuit Elements
As we discussed in Section 1.1, an element is the basic building block
of a circuit. An electric circuit is simply an interconnection of the ele-
ments. Circuit analysis is the process of determining voltages across
(or the currents through) the elements of the circuit.
There are two types of elements found in electric circuits: pas-
sive elements and active elements. An active element is capable of
generating energy while a passive element is not. Examples of pas-
sive elements are resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Typical active
elements include generators, batteries, and operational ampliﬁers. Our
aim in this section is to gain familiarity with some important active
elements.
The most important active elements are voltage or current
sources that generally deliver power to the circuit connected to
them. There are two kinds of sources: independent and dependent
sources.
An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a
speciﬁed voltage or current that is completely independent of other
circuit elements.
In other words, an ideal independent voltage source delivers to the
circuit whatever current is necessary to maintain its terminal volt-
age. Physical sources such as batteries and generators may be
regarded as approximations to ideal voltage sources. Figure 1.11
shows the symbols for independent voltage sources. Notice that both
symbols in Fig. 1.11(a) and (b) can be used to represent a dc volt-
age source, but only the symbol in Fig. 1.11(a) can be used for a
time-varying voltage source. Similarly, an ideal independent current
source is an active element that provides a speciﬁed current com-
pletely independent of the voltage across the source. That is, the cur-
rent source delivers to the circuit whatever voltage is necessary to
maintain the designated current. The symbol for an independent cur-
rent source is displayed in Fig. 1.12, where the arrow indicates the
direction of current i.
An ideal dependent (or controlled) source is an active element in
which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
Dependent sources are usually designated by diamond-shaped symbols,
as shown in Fig. 1.13. Since the control of the dependent source is
achieved by a voltage or current of some other element in the circuit,
and the source can be voltage or current, it follows that there are four
possible types of dependent sources, namely:
1. A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).
2. A current-controlled voltage source (CCVS).
3. A voltage-controlled current source (VCCS).
4. A current-controlled current source (CCCS).

Basic Concepts
Calculate the power supplied or absorbed by each element in Fig. 1.15.
Solution:
We apply the sign convention for power shown in Figs. 1.8 and 1.9.
For 
, the 5-A current is out of the positive terminal (or into the
negative terminal); hence,
For 
and 
, the current ﬂows into the positive terminal of the ele-
ment in each case.
For 
, we should note that the voltage is 8 V (positive at the top), the
same as the voltage for 
since both the passive element and the
dependent source are connected to the same terminals. (Remember that
voltage is always measured across an element in a circuit.) Since the
current ﬂows out of the positive terminal,
We should observe that the 20-V independent voltage source and 
dependent current source are supplying power to the rest of
the network, while the two passive elements are absorbing power.
Also,
In agreement with Eq. (1.8), the total power supplied equals the total
power absorbed.

The source on the right-hand side is a

Dependent sources are useful in modeling elements such as transis-
tors, operational ampliﬁers, and integrated circuits. An example of a
current-controlled voltage source is shown on the right-hand side of
Fig. 1.14, where the voltage 
of the voltage source depends on
the current i through element C. Students might be surprised that
the value of the dependent voltage source is 
V (and not 
A)
because it is a voltage source. The key idea to keep in mind is
that a voltage source comes with polarities 
in its symbol,
while a current source comes with an arrow, irrespective of what it
depends on.
It should be noted that an ideal voltage source (dependent or inde-
pendent) will produce any current required to ensure that the terminal
voltage is as stated, whereas an ideal current source will produce the
necessary voltage to ensure the stated current ﬂow. Thus, an ideal
source could in theory supply an inﬁnite amount of energy. It should
also be noted that not only do sources supply power to a circuit, they
can absorb power from a circuit too. For a voltage source, we know
the voltage but not the current supplied or drawn by it. By the same
token, we know the current supplied by a current source but not the
voltage across it.

Applications2
In this section, we will consider two practical applications of the concepts
developed in this chapter. The ﬁrst one deals with the TV picture tube
and the other with how electric utilities determine your electric bill.
1.7.1
TV Picture Tube
One important application of the motion of electrons is found in both
the transmission and reception of TV signals. At the transmission end,
a TV camera reduces a scene from an optical image to an electrical
signal. Scanning is accomplished with a thin beam of electrons in an
iconoscope camera tube.
At the receiving end, the image is reconstructed by using a cathode-
ray tube (CRT) located in the TV receiver.3 The CRT is depicted in Fig.
1.17. Unlike the iconoscope tube, which produces an electron beam of
constant intensity, the CRT beam varies in intensity according to the
incoming signal. The electron gun, maintained at a high potential, ﬁres
the electron beam. The beam passes through two sets of plates for ver-
tical and horizontal deﬂections so that the spot on the screen where the
beam strikes can move right and left and up and down. When the elec-
tron beam strikes the ﬂuorescent screen, it gives off light at that spot.
Thus, the beam can be made to “paint” a picture on the TV screen.

Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850–1918), of the University of Strasbourg,
invented the Braun cathode-ray tube in 1879. This then became the
basis for the picture tube used for so many years for televisions. It is
still the most economical device today, although the price of ﬂat-screen
systems is rapidly becoming competitive. Before the Braun tube could
be used in television, it took the inventiveness of Vladimir K.
Zworykin (1889–1982) to develop the iconoscope so that the modern
television would become a reality. The iconoscope developed into the
orthicon and the image orthicon, which allowed images to be captured
and converted into signals that could be sent to the television receiver.
Thus, the television camera was born.

Electricity Bills
The second application deals with how an electric utility company charges
their customers. The cost of electricity depends upon the amount of
energy consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh). (Other factors that affect the
cost include demand and power factors; we will ignore these for now.)
However, even if a consumer uses no energy at all, there is a minimum
service charge the customer must pay because it costs money to stay con-
nected to the power line. As energy consumption increases, the cost per
kWh drops. It is interesting to note the average monthly consumption of
household appliances for a family of ﬁve, shown in Table 1.3.

Problem Solving
Although the problems to be solved during one’s career will vary in
complexity and magnitude, the basic principles to be followed remain
the same. The process outlined here is the one developed by the
authors over many years of problem solving with students, for the
solution of engineering problems in industry, and for problem solving
in research.
We will list the steps simply and then elaborate on them.
1. Carefully deﬁne the problem.
2. Present everything you know about the problem.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success.
4. Attempt a problem solution.
5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process
again.
1. Carefully deﬁne the problem. This may be the most important part
of the process, because it becomes the foundation for all the rest of the
steps. In general, the presentation of engineering problems is somewhat
incomplete. You must do all you can to make sure you understand the
problem as thoroughly as the presenter of the problem understands it.
Time spent at this point clearly identifying the problem will save you
considerable time and frustration later. As a student, you can clarify a
problem statement in a textbook by asking your professor. A problem
presented to you in industry may require that you consult several indi-
viduals. At this step, it is important to develop questions that need to
be addressed before continuing the solution process. If you have such
questions, you need to consult with the appropriate individuals or
resources to obtain the answers to those questions. With those answers,
you can now reﬁne the problem, and use that reﬁnement as the prob-
lem statement for the rest of the solution process.
2. Present everything you know about the problem. You are now ready
to write down everything you know about the problem and its possible
solutions. This important step will save you time and frustration later.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success. Almost every problem will
have a number of possible paths that can lead to a solution. It is highly
desirable to identify as many of those paths as possible. At this point,
you also need to determine what tools are available to you, such as
PSpice and MATLAB and other software packages that can greatly
reduce effort and increase accuracy. Again, we want to stress that time
spent carefully deﬁning the problem and investigating alternative
approaches to its solution will pay big dividends later. Evaluating the
alternatives and determining which promises the greatest likelihood of
success may be difﬁcult but will be well worth the effort. Document
this process well since you will want to come back to it if the ﬁrst
approach does not work.
4. Attempt a problem solution. Now is the time to actually begin
solving the problem. The process you follow must be well documented

Problem Solving
21
Figure 1.19
Illustrative example.
Example 1.10
Solve for the current ﬂowing through the 
resistor in Fig. 1.19.
Solution:
1. Carefully deﬁne the problem. This is only a simple example, but
we can already see that we do not know the polarity on the 3-V source.
We have the following options. We can ask the professor what the
polarity should be. If we cannot ask, then we need to make a decision
on what to do next. If we have time to work the problem both ways,
we can solve for the current when the 3-V source is plus on top and
then plus on the bottom. If we do not have the time to work it both
ways, assume a polarity and then carefully document your decision.
Let us assume that the professor tells us that the source is plus on the
bottom as shown in Fig. 1.20.
2. Present everything you know about the problem. Presenting all that
we know about the problem involves labeling the circuit clearly so that
we deﬁne what we seek.
Given the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20, solve for 
.
We now check with the professor, if reasonable, to see if the prob-
lem is properly deﬁned.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success. There are essentially three
techniques that can be used to solve this problem. Later in the text you
will see that you can use circuit analysis (using Kirchhoff’s laws and
Ohm’s law), nodal analysis, and mesh analysis.
To solve for 
using circuit analysis will eventually lead to a
solution, but it will likely take more work than either nodal or mesh

in order to present a detailed solution if successful, and to evaluate the
process if you are not successful. This detailed evaluation may lead to
corrections that can then lead to a successful solution. It can also lead
to new alternatives to try. Many times, it is wise to fully set up a solu-
tion before putting numbers into equations. This will help in checking
your results.
5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy. You now thoroughly
evaluate what you have accomplished. Decide if you have an acceptable
solution, one that you want to present to your team, boss, or professor.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process
again. Now you need to present your solution or try another alterna-
tive. At this point, presenting your solution may bring closure to the
process. Often, however, presentation of a solution leads to further
reﬁnement of the problem deﬁnition, and the process continues. Fol-
lowing this process will eventually lead to a satisfactory conclusion.
Now let us look at this process for a student taking an electrical
and computer engineering foundations course. (The basic process also
applies to almost every engineering course.) Keep in mind that
although the steps have been simpliﬁed to apply to academic types of
problems, the process as stated always needs to be followed. We con-
sider a simple example.

Summary

Try applying this process to some of the more difﬁcult problems at the
end of the chapter.
Practice Problem 1.10
Summary
1. An electric circuit consists of electrical elements connected
together.
2. The International System of Units (SI) is the international mea-
surement language, which enables engineers to communicate their
results. From the seven principal units, the units of other physical
quantities can be derived.
3. Current is the rate of charge ﬂow past a given point in a given
direction.
4. Voltage is the energy required to move 1 C of charge through an
element.
5. Power is the energy supplied or absorbed per unit time. It is also
the product of voltage and current.
6. According to the passive sign convention, power assumes a posi-
tive sign when the current enters the positive polarity of the voltage
across an element.
7. An ideal voltage source produces a speciﬁc potential difference
across its terminals regardless of what is connected to it. An ideal
current source produces a speciﬁc current through its terminals
regardless of what is connected to it.
8. Voltage and current sources can be dependent or independent. A
dependent source is one whose value depends on some other cir-
cuit variable.
9. Two areas of application of the concepts covered in this chapter
are the TV picture tube and electricity billing procedure.

So we now have a very high degree of conﬁdence in the accuracy
of our answer.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process
again. This problem has been solved satisfactorily.
The current through the 8-
resistor is 0.25 A ﬂowing down through

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.b), “an ability to design and con-
duct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data.”
Engineers must be able to design and conduct experiments, as well as
analyze and interpret data. Most students have spent many hours per-
forming experiments in high school and in college. During this time,
you have been asked to analyze the data and to interpret the data.
Therefore, you should already be skilled in these two activities. My
recommendation is that, in the process of performing experiments in
the future, you spend more time in analyzing and interpreting the data
in the context of the experiment. What does this mean?
If you are looking at a plot of voltage versus resistance or current
versus resistance or power versus resistance, what do you actually see?
Does the curve make sense? Does it agree with what the theory tells
you? Does it differ from expectation, and, if so, why? Clearly, practice
with analyzing and interpreting data will enhance this skill.
Since most, if not all, the experiments you are required to do as a
student involve little or no practice in designing the experiment, how
can you develop and enhance this skill?
Actually, developing this skill under this constraint is not as difﬁ-
cult as it seems. What you need to do is to take the experiment and
analyze it. Just break it down into its simplest parts, reconstruct it try-
ing to understand why each element is there, and ﬁnally, determine
what the author of the experiment is trying to teach you. Even though
it may not always seem so, every experiment you do was designed by
someone who was sincerely motivated to teach you something.

Introduction
Chapter 1 introduced basic concepts such as current, voltage, and
power in an electric circuit. To actually determine the values of these
variables in a given circuit requires that we understand some funda-
mental laws that govern electric circuits. These laws, known as Ohm’s
law and Kirchhoff’s laws, form the foundation upon which electric cir-
cuit analysis is built.
In this chapter, in addition to these laws, we shall discuss some
techniques commonly applied in circuit design and analysis. These tech-
niques include combining resistors in series or parallel, voltage division,
current division, and delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta transformations. The
application of these laws and techniques will be restricted to resistive
circuits in this chapter. We will ﬁnally apply the laws and techniques to
real-life problems of electrical lighting and the design of dc meters.
Ohm’s Law
Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the ﬂow
of electric charge. This physical property, or ability to resist current, is
known as resistance and is represented by the symbol R. The resist-
ance of any material with a uniform cross-sectional area A depends on
A and its length , as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). We can represent resistance
(as measured in the laboratory), in mathematical form,
(2.1)
where 
is known as the resistivity of the material in ohm-meters. Good
conductors, such as copper and aluminum, have low resistivities, while
insulators, such as mica and paper, have high resistivities. Table 2.1
presents the values of 
for some common materials and shows which
materials are used for conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.
The circuit element used to model the current-resisting behavior of a
material is the resistor. For the purpose of constructing circuits, resistors
are usually made from metallic alloys and carbon compounds. The circuit

symbol for the resistor is shown in Fig. 2.1(b), where R stands for the
resistance of the resistor. The resistor is the simplest passive element.
Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854), a German physicist, is credited
with ﬁnding the relationship between current and voltage for a resis-
tor. This relationship is known as Ohm’s law.
Ohm’s law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly propor-
tional to the current i ﬂowing through the resistor.
That is,
(2.2)
Ohm deﬁned the constant of proportionality for a resistor to be the
resistance, R. (The resistance is a material property which can change
if the internal or external conditions of the element are altered, e.g., if
there are changes in the temperature.) Thus, Eq. (2.2) becomes
(2.3)
which is the mathematical form of Ohm’s law. R in Eq. (2.3) is mea-
sured in the unit of ohms, designated 
. Thus,
The resistance R of an element denotes its ability to resist the ﬂow of
electric current; it is measured in ohms ( ).
We may deduce from Eq. (2.3) that
(2.4)
so that
To apply Ohm’s law as stated in Eq. (2.3), we must pay careful
attention to the current direction and voltage polarity. The direction of
current i and the polarity of voltage v must conform with the passive

Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854), a German physicist, in 1826
experimentally determined the most basic law relating voltage and cur-
rent for a resistor. Ohm’s work was initially denied by critics.
Born of humble beginnings in Erlangen, Bavaria, Ohm threw him-
self into electrical research. His efforts resulted in his famous law.
He was awarded the Copley Medal in 1841 by the Royal Society of
London. In 1849, he was given the Professor of Physics chair by the
University of Munich. To honor him, the unit of resistance was named
the ohm.

from a higher potential to a lower potential in order for

rent ﬂows from a lower potential to a higher potential,

Since the value of R can range from zero to inﬁnity, it is impor-
tant that we consider the two extreme possible values of R. An element
with 
is called a short circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.2(a). For a short
circuit,

showing that the voltage is zero but the current could be anything. In
practice, a short circuit is usually a connecting wire assumed to be a
perfect conductor. Thus,
A short circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.
Similarly, an element with 
is known as an open circuit, as
shown in Fig. 2.2(b). For an open circuit,

indicating that the current is zero though the voltage could be anything.
Thus,
An open circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching inﬁnity.
A resistor is either ﬁxed or variable. Most resistors are of the ﬁxed
type, meaning their resistance remains constant. The two common types
of ﬁxed resistors (wirewound and composition) are shown in Fig. 2.3.
The composition resistors are used when large resistance is needed.
The circuit symbol in Fig. 2.1(b) is for a ﬁxed resistor. Variable resis-
tors have adjustable resistance. The symbol for a variable resistor is
shown in Fig. 2.4(a). A common variable resistor is known as a poten-
tiometer or pot for short, with the symbol shown in Fig. 2.4(b). The
pot is a three-terminal element with a sliding contact or wiper. By slid-
ing the wiper, the resistances between the wiper terminal and the ﬁxed
terminals vary. Like ﬁxed resistors, variable resistors can be of either
wirewound or composition type, as shown in Fig. 2.5. Although resistors
like those in Figs. 2.3 and 2.5 are used in circuit designs, today most

circuit components including resistors are either surface mounted or
integrated, as typically shown in Fig. 2.6.
It should be pointed out that not all resistors obey Ohm’s law. A
resistor that obeys Ohm’s law is known as a linear resistor. It has a
constant resistance and thus its current-voltage characteristic is as illus-
trated in Fig. 2.7(a): Its i-v graph is a straight line passing through the
origin. A nonlinear resistor does not obey Ohm’s law. Its resistance
varies with current and its i-v characteristic is typically shown in
Fig. 2.7(b). Examples of devices with nonlinear resistance are the light
bulb and the diode. Although all practical resistors may exhibit nonlin-
ear behavior under certain conditions, we will assume in this book that
all elements actually designated as resistors are linear.
A useful quantity in circuit analysis is the reciprocal of resistance
R, known as conductance and denoted by G:
(2.7)
The conductance is a measure of how well an element will con-
duct electric current. The unit of conductance is the mho (ohm spelled
backward) or reciprocal ohm, with symbol 
, the inverted omega.
Although engineers often use the mho, in this book we prefer to use
the siemens (S), the SI unit of conductance:
(2.8)
Thus,
Conductance is the ability of an element to conduct electric current;
it is measured in mhos (
) or siemens (S).
The same resistance can be expressed in ohms or siemens. For
example, 
is the same as 0.1 S. From Eq. (2.7), we may write
(2.9)
The power dissipated by a resistor can be expressed in terms of R.
Using Eqs. (1.7) and (2.3),
(2.10)
The power dissipated by a resistor may also be expressed in terms of
G as
(2.11)
We should note two things from Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11):
1. The power dissipated in a resistor is a nonlinear function of either
current or voltage.
2. Since R and G are positive quantities, the power dissipated in a
resistor is always positive. Thus, a resistor always absorbs power
from the circuit. This conﬁrms the idea that a resistor is a passive
element, incapable of generating energy.

Nodes, Branches, and Loops
Since the elements of an electric circuit can be interconnected in sev-
eral ways, we need to understand some basic concepts of network
topology. To differentiate between a circuit and a network, we may
regard a network as an interconnection of elements or devices, whereas
a circuit is a network providing one or more closed paths. The con-
vention, when addressing network topology, is to use the word network
rather than circuit. We do this even though the word network and cir-
cuit mean the same thing when used in this context. In network topol-
ogy, we study the properties relating to the placement of elements in
the network and the geometric conﬁguration of the network. Such ele-
ments include branches, nodes, and loops.
A branch represents a single element such as a voltage source or a
resistor.
In other words, a branch represents any two-terminal element. The cir-
cuit in Fig. 2.10 has ﬁve branches, namely, the 10-V voltage source,
the 2-A current source, and the three resistors.
A node is the point of connection between two or more branches.
A node is usually indicated by a dot in a circuit. If a short circuit (a
connecting wire) connects two nodes, the two nodes constitute a sin-
gle node. The circuit in Fig. 2.10 has three nodes 
, and c. Notice
that the three points that form node b are connected by perfectly con-
ducting wires and therefore constitute a single point. The same is true
of the four points forming node c. We demonstrate that the circuit in
Fig. 2.10 has only three nodes by redrawing the circuit in Fig. 2.11.
The two circuits in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11 are identical. However, for the
sake of clarity, nodes b and c are spread out with perfect conductors
as in Fig. 2.10.

Chapter 2
Basic Laws
A loop is any closed path in a circuit.
A loop is a closed path formed by starting at a node, passing through a
set of nodes, and returning to the starting node without passing through
any node more than once. A loop is said to be independent if it contains
at least one branch which is not a part of any other independent loop.
Independent loops or paths result in independent sets of equations.
It is possible to form an independent set of loops where one of the
loops does not contain such a branch. In Fig. 2.11, abca with the 
resistor is independent. A second loop with the 
resistor and the cur-
rent source is independent. The third loop could be the one with the 
resistor in parallel with the 
resistor. This does form an independent
set of loops.
A network with b branches, n nodes, and l independent loops will
satisfy the fundamental theorem of network topology:
(2.12)
As the next two deﬁnitions show, circuit topology is of great value
to the study of voltages and currents in an electric circuit.
Two or more elements are in series if they exclusively share a single
node and consequently carry the same current.
Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same
two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them.
Elements are in series when they are chain-connected or connected
sequentially, end to end. For example, two elements are in series if
they share one common node and no other element is connected to
that common node. Elements in parallel are connected to the same pair
of terminals. Elements may be connected in a way that they are nei-
ther in series nor in parallel. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10, the volt-
age source and the 5-
resistor are in series because the same current
will ﬂow through them. The 2-
resistor, the 3-
resistor, and the cur-
rent source are in parallel because they are connected to the same two
nodes b and c and consequently have the same voltage across them.
The 5-
and 2-
resistors are neither in series nor in parallel with
each other.

Solution:
Since there are four elements in the circuit, the circuit has four
branches: 10 V, 
, and 2 A. The circuit has three nodes as
identiﬁed in Fig. 2.13. The 5-
resistor is in series with the 10-V
voltage source because the same current would ﬂow in both. The 6-

connected to the same nodes 2 and 3.

Kirchhoff’s Laws
Ohm’s law by itself is not sufﬁcient to analyze circuits. However, when
it is coupled with Kirchhoff’s two laws, we have a sufﬁcient, powerful
set of tools for analyzing a large variety of electric circuits. Kirchhoff’s
laws were ﬁrst introduced in 1847 by the German physicist Gustav
Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887). These laws are formally known as
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL).
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law is based on the law of conservation of charge,
which requires that the algebraic sum of charges within a system cannot
change.
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents
entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.
Mathematically, KCL implies that

entering a node may be regarded as positive, while currents leaving the
node may be taken as negative or vice versa.
To prove KCL, assume a set of currents 
ﬂow
into a node. The algebraic sum of currents at the node is
(2.14)
Integrating both sides of Eq. (2.14) gives
(2.15)
where 
and 
But the law of conserva-
tion of electric charge requires that the algebraic sum of electric
charges at the node must not change; that is, the node stores no net
charge. Thus 
conﬁrming the validity of KCL.
Consider the node in Fig. 2.16. Applying KCL gives
(2.16)
since currents 
, and 
are entering the node, while currents 
and
are leaving it. By rearranging the terms, we get
(2.17)
Equation (2.17) is an alternative form of KCL:
The sum of the currents entering a node is equal to the sum of the cur-
rents leaving the node.
Note that KCL also applies to a closed boundary. This may be
regarded as a generalized case, because a node may be regarded as a
closed surface shrunk to a point. In two dimensions, a closed bound-
ary is the same as a closed path. As typically illustrated in the circuit
of Fig. 2.17, the total current entering the closed surface is equal to the
total current leaving the surface.
A simple application of KCL is combining current sources in par-
allel. The combined current is the algebraic sum of the current supplied
by the individual sources. For example, the current sources shown in

Two sources (or circuits in general) are
said to be equivalent if they have the
same i-v relationship at a pair of
terminals.
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887), a German physicist, stated
two basic laws in 1847 concerning the relationship between the cur-
rents and voltages in an electrical network. Kirchhoff’s laws, along
with Ohm’s law, form the basis of circuit theory.
Born the son of a lawyer in Konigsberg, East Prussia, Kirchhoff
entered the University of Konigsberg at age 18 and later became a lec-
turer in Berlin. His collaborative work in spectroscopy with German
chemist Robert Bunsen led to the discovery of cesium in 1860 and
rubidium in 1861. Kirchhoff was also credited with the Kirchhoff law
of radiation. Thus Kirchhoff is famous among engineers, chemists, and
physicists.

Fig. 2.18(a) can be combined as in Fig. 2.18(b). The combined or
equivalent current source can be found by applying KCL to node a.
or
(2.18)
A circuit cannot contain two different currents, 
and 
, in series,
unless 
; otherwise KCL will be violated.
Kirchhoff’s second law is based on the principle of conservation
of energy:
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all volt-
ages around a closed path (or loop) is zero.
Expressed mathematically, KVL states that
(2.19)
where M is the number of voltages in the loop (or the number of
branches in the loop) and 
is the mth voltage.
To illustrate KVL, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.19. The sign on
each voltage is the polarity of the terminal encountered ﬁrst as we
travel around the loop. We can start with any branch and go around
the loop either clockwise or counterclockwise. Suppose we start with
the voltage source and go clockwise around the loop as shown; then
voltages would be 
and 
in that order. For
example, as we reach branch 3, the positive terminal is met ﬁrst; hence,
we have 
For branch 4, we reach the negative terminal ﬁrst; hence,
Thus, KVL yields
(2.20)
Rearranging terms gives
(2.21)
which may be interpreted as
(2.22)
This is an alternative form of KVL. Notice that if we had traveled
counterclockwise, the result would have been 
and 
which is the same as before except that the signs are reversed.
Hence, Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) remain the same.
When voltage sources are connected in series, KVL can be applied
to obtain the total voltage. The combined voltage is the algebraic sum
of the voltages of the individual sources. For example, for the voltage
sources shown in Fig. 2.20(a), the combined or equivalent voltage
source in Fig. 2.20(b) is obtained by applying KVL.

Series Resistors and Voltage Division
The need to combine resistors in series or in parallel occurs so fre-
quently that it warrants special attention. The process of combining the
resistors is facilitated by combining two of them at a time. With this
in mind, consider the single-loop circuit of Fig. 2.29. The two resistors
2.5

are in series, since the same current i ﬂows in both of them. Applying
Ohm’s law to each of the resistors, we obtain
(2.24)
If we apply KVL to the loop (moving in the clockwise direction), we
have
(2.25)
Combining Eqs. (2.24) and (2.25), we get
(2.26)
or
(2.27)
Notice that Eq. (2.26) can be written as
(2.28)
implying that the two resistors can be replaced by an equivalent resis-
tor 
; that is,
(2.29)
Thus, Fig. 2.29 can be replaced by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 2.30.
The two circuits in Figs. 2.29 and 2.30 are equivalent because they
exhibit the same voltage-current relationships at the terminals a-b. An
equivalent circuit such as the one in Fig. 2.30 is useful in simplifying
the analysis of a circuit. In general,
The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors connected in
series is the sum of the individual resistances.
For N resistors in series then,
(2.30)
To determine the voltage across each resistor in Fig. 2.29, we sub-
stitute Eq. (2.26) into Eq. (2.24) and obtain
(2.31)
Notice that the source voltage v is divided among the resistors in direct
proportion to their resistances; the larger the resistance, the larger the
voltage drop. This is called the principle of voltage division, and the
circuit in Fig. 2.29 is called a voltage divider. In general, if a voltage
divider has N resistors 
in series with the source volt-
age v, the nth resistor (
) will have a voltage drop of

Parallel Resistors 
and Current Division
Consider the circuit in Fig. 2.31, where two resistors are connected
in parallel and therefore have the same voltage across them. From
Ohm’s law,
or
(2.33)
Applying KCL at node a gives the total current i as
(2.34)
Substituting Eq. (2.33) into Eq. (2.34), we get
(2.35)
where 
is the equivalent resistance of the resistors in parallel:
(2.36)
or
or
(2.37)
Thus,
The equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors is equal to the prod-
uct of their resistances divided by their sum.
It must be emphasized that this applies only to two resistors in paral-
lel. From Eq. (2.37), if 
then 
We can extend the result in Eq. (2.36) to the general case of a cir-
cuit with N resistors in parallel. The equivalent resistance is

For example, if four 100-
resistors are connected in parallel, their
equivalent resistance is 
It is often more convenient to use conductance rather than resist-
ance when dealing with resistors in parallel. From Eq. (2.38), the equiv-
alent conductance for N resistors in parallel is
(2.40)
where 
Equation (2.40) states:
The equivalent conductance of resistors connected in parallel is the
sum of their individual conductances.
This means that we may replace the circuit in Fig. 2.31 with that in
Fig. 2.32. Notice the similarity between Eqs. (2.30) and (2.40). The
equivalent conductance of parallel resistors is obtained the same way
as the equivalent resistance of series resistors. In the same manner,
the equivalent conductance of resistors in series is obtained just
the same way as the resistance of resistors in parallel. Thus the
equivalent conductance 
of N resistors in series (such as shown in
Fig. 2.29) is
(2.41)
Given the total current i entering node a in Fig. 2.31, how do we
obtain current 
and 
We know that the equivalent resistor has the
same voltage, or
(2.42)
Combining Eqs. (2.33) and (2.42) results in
(2.43)
which shows that the total current i is shared by the resistors in
inverse proportion to their resistances. This is known as the princi-
ple of current division, and the circuit in Fig. 2.31 is known as a
current divider. Notice that the larger current flows through the
smaller resistance.
As an extreme case, suppose one of the resistors in Fig. 2.31 is
zero, say 
; that is, 
is a short circuit, as shown in
Fig. 2.33(a). From Eq. (2.43), 
implies that 
. This
means that the entire current i bypasses 
and ﬂows through the
short circuit 
, the path of least resistance. Thus when a circuit

is short circuited, as shown in Fig. 2.33(a), two things should be kept
in mind:
1. The equivalent resistance 
[See what happens when
in Eq. (2.37).]
2. The entire current ﬂows through the short circuit.
As another extreme case, suppose 
that is, 
is an open
circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.33(b). The current still ﬂows through the
path of least resistance, 
By taking the limit of Eq. (2.37) as 
we obtain 
in this case.
If we divide both the numerator and denominator by 
Eq. (2.43)
becomes

in parallel with the source current i, the nth conductor (

In general, it is often convenient and possible to combine resis-
tors in series and parallel and reduce a resistive network to a single
equivalent resistance
Such an equivalent resistance is the resist-
ance between the designated terminals of the network and must
exhibit the same i-v characteristics as the original network at the
terminals.

Wye-Delta Transformations
Situations often arise in circuit analysis when the resistors are neither in
parallel nor in series. For example, consider the bridge circuit in Fig. 2.46.
How do we combine resistors 
through 
when the resistors are neither
in series nor in parallel? Many circuits of the type shown in Fig. 2.46
can be simpliﬁed by using three-terminal equivalent networks. These are

or as part of a larger network. They are used in three-phase networks,
electrical ﬁlters, and matching networks. Our main interest here is in how
to identify them when they occur as part of a network and how to apply
wye-delta transformation in the analysis of that network.

Delta to Wye Conversion
Suppose it is more convenient to work with a wye network in a place
where the circuit contains a delta conﬁguration. We superimpose a wye
network on the existing delta network and ﬁnd the equivalent resistances
in the wye network. To obtain the equivalent resistances in the wye net-
work, we compare the two networks and make sure that the resistance
between each pair of nodes in the 
(or 
) network is the same as the
resistance between the same pair of nodes in the Y (or T) network. For
terminals 1 and 2 in Figs. 2.47 and 2.48, for example,

Obtain the equivalent resistance 
for the circuit in Fig. 2.52 and use
it to ﬁnd current i.
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned. Please note, this part
normally will deservedly take much more time.
2. Present. Clearly, when we remove the voltage source, we end
up with a purely resistive circuit. Since it is composed of deltas
and wyes, we have a more complex process of combining the
elements together. We can use wye-delta transformations as one
approach to ﬁnd a solution. It is useful to locate the wyes (there
are two of them, one at n and the other at c) and the deltas
(there are three: can, abn, cnb).
3. Alternative. There are different approaches that can be used to
solve this problem. Since the focus of Sec. 2.7 is the wye-delta
transformation, this should be the technique to use. Another
approach would be to solve for the equivalent resistance by
injecting one amp into the circuit and ﬁnding the voltage
between a and b; we will learn about this approach in Chap. 4.
The approach we can apply here as a check would be to use
a wye-delta transformation as the ﬁrst solution to the problem.
Later we can check the solution by starting with a delta-wye
transformation.
4. Attempt. In this circuit, there are two Y networks and three 
networks. Transforming just one of these will simplify the circuit.
If we convert the Y network comprising the 5-
10-

resistors, we may select

So far, we have assumed that connect-
ing wires are perfect conductors (i.e.,
conductors of zero resistance). In real
physical systems, however, the resist-
ance of the connecting wire may be
appreciably large, and the modeling
of the system must include that
resistance.
Applications
Resistors are often used to model devices that convert electrical energy
into heat or other forms of energy. Such devices include conducting
wire, light bulbs, electric heaters, stoves, ovens, and loudspeakers. In
this section, we will consider two real-life problems that apply the con-
cepts developed in this chapter: electrical lighting systems and design
of dc meters.
2.8.1
Lighting Systems
Lighting systems, such as in a house or on a Christmas tree, often con-
sist of N lamps connected either in parallel or in series, as shown in
Fig. 2.55. Each lamp is modeled as a resistor. Assuming that all the lamps
are identical and 
is the power-line voltage, the voltage across each
lamp is 
for the parallel connection and 
for the series connec-
tion. The series connection is easy to manufacture but is seldom used
in practice, for at least two reasons. First, it is less reliable; when a lamp
fails, all the lamps go out. Second, it is harder to maintain; when a lamp
is bad, one must test all the lamps one by one to detect the faulty one.

Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) was perhaps the greatest
American inventor. He patented 1093 inventions, including such
history-making inventions as the incandescent electric bulb, the phono-
graph, and the ﬁrst commercial motion pictures.
Born in Milan, Ohio, the youngest of seven children, Edison received
only three months of formal education because he hated school. He was
home-schooled by his mother and quickly began to read on his own. In
1868, Edison read one of Faraday’s books and found his calling. He
moved to Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1876, where he managed a well-
staffed research laboratory. Most of his inventions came out of this
laboratory. His laboratory served as a model for modern research organ-
izations. Because of his diverse interests and the overwhelming number
of his inventions and patents, Edison began to establish manufacturing
companies for making the devices he invented. He designed the ﬁrst elec-
tric power station to supply electric light. Formal electrical engineering
education began in the mid-1880s with Edison as a role model and leader.

Design of DC Meters
By their nature, resistors are used to control the ﬂow of current. We
take advantage of this property in several applications, such as in a
potentiometer (Fig. 2.57). The word potentiometer, derived from the
words potential and meter, implies that potential can be metered out.
The potentiometer (or pot for short) is a three-terminal device that oper-
ates on the principle of voltage division. It is essentially an adjustable
voltage divider. As a voltage regulator, it is used as a volume or level
control on radios, TVs, and other devices. In Fig. 2.57,

each with a power rating of 40 W. If the voltage at the plug is 110 V
for the parallel and series connections, calculate the current through
each bulb for both cases.
Answer: 364 mA (parallel), 3.64 A (series).

where 
Thus, 
decreases or increases as the sliding
contact of the pot moves toward c or a, respectively.
Another application where resistors are used to control current ﬂow
is in the analog dc meters—the ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter,
which measure current, voltage, and resistance, respectively. Each of
these meters employs the d’Arsonval meter movement, shown in
Fig. 2.58. The movement consists essentially of a movable iron-core coil
mounted on a pivot between the poles of a permanent magnet. When
current ﬂows through the coil, it creates a torque which causes the pointer
to deﬂect. The amount of current through the coil determines the deﬂec-
tion of the pointer, which is registered on a scale attached to the meter
movement. For example, if the meter movement is rated 1 mA, 50 
it
would take 1 mA to cause a full-scale deﬂection of the meter movement.
By introducing additional circuitry to the d’Arsonval meter movement,
an ammeter, voltmeter, or ohmmeter can be constructed.
Consider Fig. 2.59, where an analog voltmeter and ammeter are
connected to an element. The voltmeter measures the voltage across a
load and is therefore connected in parallel with the element. As shown

An instrument capable of measuring
voltage, current, and resistance is
called a multimeter or a volt-ohm
meter (VOM).
A load is a component that is receiving
energy (an energy sink), as opposed
to a generator supplying energy (an
energy source). More about loading

Connection of a voltmeter and an amme-

in Fig. 2.60(a), the voltmeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in
series with a resistor whose resistance 
is deliberately made very
large (theoretically, inﬁnite), to minimize the current drawn from the
circuit. To extend the range of voltage that the meter can measure,
series multiplier resistors are often connected with the voltmeters, as
shown in Fig. 2.60(b). The multiple-range voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b) can
measure voltage from 0 to 1 V, 0 to 10 V, or 0 to 100 V, depending on
whether the switch is connected to 
or 
respectively.
Let us calculate the multiplier resistor 
for the single-range volt-
meter in Fig. 2.60(a), or 
or 
for the multiple-range
voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b). We need to determine the value of 
to be
connected in series with the internal resistance 
of the voltmeter. In
any design, we consider the worst-case condition. In this case, the
worst case occurs when the full-scale current 
ﬂows through
the meter. This should also correspond to the maximum voltage read-
ing or the full-scale voltage

Similarly, the ammeter measures the current through the load and
is connected in series with it. As shown in Fig. 2.61(a), the ammeter
consists of a d’Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor whose
resistance 
is deliberately made very small (theoretically, zero) to
minimize the voltage drop across it. To allow multiple ranges, shunt
resistors are often connected in parallel with 
as shown in
Fig. 2.61(b). The shunt resistors allow the meter to measure in the
range 0–10 mA, 0–100 mA, or 0–1 A, depending on whether the switch
is connected to 
or 
respectively.
Now our objective is to obtain the multiplier shunt 
for the single-
range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(a), or 
or 
for the multiple-
range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(b). We notice that

The direct method of measuring resistance is to use an ohmmeter. An
ohmmeter consists basically of a d’Arsonval movement, a variable
resistor or potentiometer, and a battery, as shown in Fig. 2.62(b).
Applying KVL to the circuit in Fig. 2.62(b) gives

The resistor R is selected such that the meter gives a full-scale deﬂec-
tion; that is,

Substituting Eq. (2.64) into Eq. (2.63) leads to
(2.65)
As mentioned, the types of meters we have discussed are known
as analog meters and are based on the d’Arsonval meter movement.
Another type of meter, called a digital meter, is based on active circuit
elements such as op amps. For example, a digital multimeter displays
measurements of dc or ac voltage, current, and resistance as discrete
numbers, instead of using a pointer deﬂection on a continuous scale as
in an analog multimeter. Digital meters are what you would most likely
use in a modern lab. However, the design of digital meters is beyond
the scope of this book.

Samuel F. B. Morse (1791–1872), an American painter, invented
the telegraph, the first practical, commercialized application of
electricity.
Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts and studied at Yale
and the Royal Academy of Arts in London to become an artist. In the
1830s, he became intrigued with developing a telegraph. He had a
working model by 1836 and applied for a patent in 1838. The U.S.
Senate appropriated funds for Morse to construct a telegraph line
between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. On May 24, 1844, he sent
the famous ﬁrst message: “What hath God wrought!” Morse also devel-
oped a code of dots and dashes for letters and numbers, for sending
messages on the telegraph. The development of the telegraph led to the
invention of the telephone.

Following the voltmeter setup of Fig. 2.60, design a voltmeter for the
following multiple ranges:
(a) 0–1 V
(b) 0–5 V
(c) 0–50 V
(d) 0–100 V
Assume that the internal resistance 
and the full-scale cur-
rent 
Solution:
We apply Eq. (2.60) and assume that 
and 
correspond
with ranges 0–1 V, 0–5 V, 0–50 V, and 0–100 V, respectively.
(a) For range 0–1 V,
(b) For range 0–5 V,
(c) For range 0–50 V,
(d) For range 0–100 V,
Note that the ratio of the total resistance (
) to the full-scale
voltage 
is constant and equal to 
for the four ranges. This ratio
(given in ohms per volt, or 
/V) is known as the sensitivity of the
voltmeter. The larger the sensitivity, the better the voltmeter.

Summary
1. A resistor is a passive element in which the voltage v across it is
directly proportional to the current i through it. That is, a resistor
is a device that obeys Ohm’s law,
where R is the resistance of the resistor.
v  iR
2.9

2. A short circuit is a resistor (a perfectly, conducting wire) with zero
resistance (
). An open circuit is a resistor with inﬁnite resis-
tance (
).
3. The conductance G of a resistor is the reciprocal of its resistance:
4. A branch is a single two-terminal element in an electric circuit. A
node is the point of connection between two or more branches. A
loop is a closed path in a circuit. The number of branches b, the
number of nodes n, and the number of independent loops l in a
network are related as
5. Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the currents at any node
algebraically sum to zero. In other words, the sum of the currents
entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.
6. Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the voltages around a
closed path algebraically sum to zero. In other words, the sum of
voltage rises equals the sum of voltage drops.
7. Two elements are in series when they are connected sequentially,
end to end. When elements are in series, the same current ﬂows
through them 
. They are in parallel if they are connected
to the same two nodes. Elements in parallel always have the same
voltage across them (
).
8. When two resistors 
and 
are in series, their
equivalent resistance 
and equivalent conductance 
are
9. When two resistors 
and 
are in parallel,
their equivalent resistance 
and equivalent conductance 
are
10. The voltage division principle for two resistors in series is
11. The current division principle for two resistors in parallel is
12. The formulas for a delta-to-wye transformation are

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Electronics
One area of application for electric circuit analysis is electronics. The
term electronics was originally used to distinguish circuits of very low
current levels. This distinction no longer holds, as power semiconduc-
tor devices operate at high levels of current. Today, electronics is
regarded as the science of the motion of charges in a gas, vacuum, or
semiconductor. Modern electronics involves transistors and transistor
circuits. The earlier electronic circuits were assembled from compo-
nents. Many electronic circuits are now produced as integrated circuits,
fabricated in a semiconductor substrate or chip.
Electronic circuits ﬁnd applications in many areas, such as automa-
tion, broadcasting, computers, and instrumentation. The range of devices
that use electronic circuits is enormous and is limited only by our imag-
ination. Radio, television, computers, and stereo systems are but a few.
An electrical engineer usually performs diverse functions and is likely
to use, design, or construct systems that incorporate some form of elec-
tronic circuits. Therefore, an understanding of the operation and analysis
of electronics is essential to the electrical engineer. Electronics has
become a specialty distinct from other disciplines within electrical engi-
neering. Because the ﬁeld of electronics is ever advancing, an electronics
engineer must update his/her knowledge from time to time. The best way
to do this is by being a member of a professional organization such as
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). With a mem-
bership of over 300,000, the IEEE is the largest professional organization
in the world. Members beneﬁt immensely from the numerous magazines,
journals, transactions, and conference/symposium proceedings published
yearly by IEEE. You should consider becoming an IEEE member.

Introduction
Having understood the fundamental laws of circuit theory (Ohm’s law
and Kirchhoff’s laws), we are now prepared to apply these laws to
develop two powerful techniques for circuit analysis: nodal analysis,
which is based on a systematic application of Kirchhoff’s current law
(KCL), and mesh analysis, which is based on a systematic application
of Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL). The two techniques are so impor-
tant that this chapter should be regarded as the most important in the
book. Students are therefore encouraged to pay careful attention.
With the two techniques to be developed in this chapter, we can ana-
lyze any linear circuit by obtaining a set of simultaneous equations that
are then solved to obtain the required values of current or voltage. One
method of solving simultaneous equations involves Cramer’s rule, which
allows us to calculate circuit variables as a quotient of determinants. The
examples in the chapter will illustrate this method; Appendix A also
brieﬂy summarizes the essentials the reader needs to know for applying
Cramer’s rule. Another method of solving simultaneous equations is to
use MATLAB, a computer software discussed in Appendix E.
Also in this chapter, we introduce the use of PSpice for Windows,
a circuit simulation computer software program that we will use
throughout the text. Finally, we apply the techniques learned in this
chapter to analyze transistor circuits.
Nodal Analysis
Nodal analysis provides a general procedure for analyzing circuits
using node voltages as the circuit variables. Choosing node voltages
instead of element voltages as circuit variables is convenient and
reduces the number of equations one must solve simultaneously.
To simplify matters, we shall assume in this section that circuits
do not contain voltage sources. Circuits that contain voltage sources
will be analyzed in the next section.
In nodal analysis, we are interested in ﬁnding the node voltages.
Given a circuit with n nodes without voltage sources, the nodal analy-
sis of the circuit involves taking the following three steps.
3.2
3.1
82
Chapter 3
Methods of Analysis
Nodal analysis is also known as the
node-voltage method.
Steps to Determine Node Voltages:
1. Select a node as the reference node. Assign voltages 
to the remaining 
nodes. The voltages are
referenced with respect to the reference node.
2. Apply KCL to each of the 
nonreference nodes. Use
Ohm’s law to express the branch currents in terms of node
voltages.
3. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations to obtain the
unknown node voltages.
n  1
n  1
v2, p , vn1
v1,
We shall now explain and apply these three steps.
The ﬁrst step in nodal analysis is selecting a node as the reference
or datum node. The reference node is commonly called the ground

since it is assumed to have zero potential. A reference node is indicated
by any of the three symbols in Fig. 3.1. The type of ground in Fig. 3.1(c)
is called a chassis ground and is used in devices where the case, enclo-
sure, or chassis acts as a reference point for all circuits. When the
potential of the earth is used as reference, we use the earth ground in
Fig. 3.1(a) or (b). We shall always use the symbol in Fig. 3.1(b).
Once we have selected a reference node, we assign voltage desig-
nations to nonreference nodes. Consider, for example, the circuit in
Fig. 3.2(a). Node 0 is the reference node 
while nodes 1 and
2 are assigned voltages 
and 
respectively. Keep in mind that the
node voltages are deﬁned with respect to the reference node. As illus-
trated in Fig. 3.2(a), each node voltage is the voltage rise from the ref-
erence node to the corresponding nonreference node or simply the
voltage of that node with respect to the reference node.
As the second step, we apply KCL to each nonreference node in
the circuit. To avoid putting too much information on the same circuit,
the circuit in Fig. 3.2(a) is redrawn in Fig. 3.2(b), where we now add
and 
as the currents through resistors 
and 
respec-
tively. At node 1, applying KCL gives
(3.1)
At node 2,
(3.2)
We now apply Ohm’s law to express the unknown currents 
and
in terms of node voltages. The key idea to bear in mind is that, since
resistance is a passive element, by the passive sign convention, current
must always ﬂow from a higher potential to a lower potential.

Fig. 3.2(b),

In terms of the conductances, Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) become
(3.7)
(3.8)
The third step in nodal analysis is to solve for the node voltages.
If we apply KCL to 
nonreference nodes, we obtain 
simul-
taneous equations such as Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8). For
the circuit of Fig. 3.2, we solve Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8)
to obtain the node voltages 
and 
using any standard method, such
as the substitution method, the elimination method, Cramer’s rule, or
matrix inversion. To use either of the last two methods, one must cast
the simultaneous equations in matrix form. For example, Eqs. (3.7) and
(3.8) can be cast in matrix form as
(3.9)
which can be solved to get 
and 
Equation 3.9 will be generalized
in Section 3.6. The simultaneous equations may also be solved using
calculators or with software packages such as MATLAB, Mathcad,
Maple, and Quattro Pro.

Methods of Analysis
Appendix A discusses how to use
Cramer’s rule.
Calculate the node voltages in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.3(a).
Solution:
Consider Fig. 3.3(b), where the circuit in Fig. 3.3(a) has been prepared
for nodal analysis. Notice how the currents are selected for the
application of KCL. Except for the branches with current sources, the
labeling of the currents is arbitrary but consistent. (By consistent, we
mean that if, for example, we assume that 
enters the 
resistor
from the left-hand side, 
must leave the resistor from the right-hand
side.) The reference node is selected, and the node voltages 
and 
are now to be determined.
At node 1, applying KCL and Ohm’s law gives
Multiplying each term in the last equation by 4, we obtain

If we need the currents, we can easily calculate them from the

The fact that

opposite to the one assumed.

Determine the voltages at the nodes in Fig. 3.5(a).
Solution:
The circuit in this example has three nonreference nodes, unlike the pre-

Nodal Analysis with Voltage Sources
We now consider how voltage sources affect nodal analysis. We use the
circuit in Fig. 3.7 for illustration. Consider the following two possibilities.
■CASE 1
If a voltage source is connected between the reference
node and a nonreference node, we simply set the voltage at the non-
reference node equal to the voltage of the voltage source. In Fig. 3.7,
for example,
(3.10)
Thus, our analysis is somewhat simpliﬁed by this knowledge of the volt-
age at this node.
■CASE 2
If the voltage source (dependent or independent) is con-
nected between two nonreference nodes, the two nonreference nodes

A supernode is formed by enclosing a (dependent or independent)
voltage source connected between two nonreference nodes and any
elements connected in parallel with it.
form a generalized node or supernode; we apply both KCL and KVL
to determine the node voltages.

A supernode may be regarded as a
closed surface enclosing the voltage
source and its two nodes.
In Fig. 3.7, nodes 2 and 3 form a supernode. (We could have more
than two nodes forming a single supernode. For example, see the cir-
cuit in Fig. 3.14.) We analyze a circuit with supernodes using the
same three steps mentioned in the previous section except that the
supernodes are treated differently. Why? Because an essential com-
ponent of nodal analysis is applying KCL, which requires knowing
the current through each element. There is no way of knowing the
current through a voltage source in advance. However, KCL must
be satisﬁed at a supernode like any other node. Hence, at the super-
node in Fig. 3.7,
(3.11a)
or
(3.11b)
To apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the supernode in Fig. 3.7, we
redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8. Going around the loop in the
clockwise direction gives
(3.12)
From Eqs. (3.10), (3.11b), and (3.12), we obtain the node voltages.
Note the following properties of a supernode:
1. The voltage source inside the supernode provides a constraint
equation needed to solve for the node voltages.
2. A supernode has no voltage of its own.
3. A supernode requires the application of both KCL and KVL.

Mesh Analysis
Mesh analysis provides another general procedure for analyzing cir-
cuits, using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currents
instead of element currents as circuit variables is convenient and
reduces the number of equations that must be solved simultaneously.
Recall that a loop is a closed path with no node passed more than once.
A mesh is a loop that does not contain any other loop within it.
Nodal analysis applies KCL to ﬁnd unknown voltages in a given
circuit, while mesh analysis applies KVL to ﬁnd unknown currents.
Mesh analysis is not quite as general as nodal analysis because it is
only applicable to a circuit that is planar. A planar circuit is one that
can be drawn in a plane with no branches crossing one another; oth-
erwise it is nonplanar. A circuit may have crossing branches and still
be planar if it can be redrawn such that it has no crossing branches.
For example, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) has two crossing branches, but
it can be redrawn as in Fig. 3.15(b). Hence, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a)
is planar. However, the circuit in Fig. 3.16 is nonplanar, because there
is no way to redraw it and avoid the branches crossing. Nonplanar cir-
cuits can be handled using nodal analysis, but they will not be con-
sidered in this text.

Mesh analysis is also known as loop
analysis or the mesh-current method.

To illustrate the steps, consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17. The ﬁrst
step requires that mesh currents 
and 
are assigned to meshes 1 and
2. Although a mesh current may be assigned to each mesh in an arbi-
trary direction, it is conventional to assume that each mesh current
ﬂows clockwise.
As the second step, we apply KVL to each mesh. Applying KVL
to mesh 1, we obtain
or
(3.13)
For mesh 2, applying KVL gives
or
(3.14)
Note in Eq. (3.13) that the coefﬁcient of 
is the sum of the resistances
in the ﬁrst mesh, while the coefﬁcient of 
is the negative of the resis-
tance common to meshes 1 and 2. Now observe that the same is true
in Eq. (3.14). This can serve as a shortcut way of writing the mesh
equations. We will exploit this idea in Section 3.6.

Steps to Determine Mesh Currents:
1. Assign mesh currents 
to the n meshes.
2. Apply KVL to each of the n meshes. Use Ohm’s law to
express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents.
3. Solve the resulting n simultaneous equations to get the mesh
currents.
i1, i2, p , in
The direction of the mesh current is
arbitrary—(clockwise or counterclock-
wise)—and does not affect the validity
of the solution.
Although path abcdefa is a loop and
not a mesh, KVL still holds. This is the
reason for loosely using the terms
loop analysis and mesh analysis to
mean the same thing.
In Fig. 3.17, for example, paths abefa and bcdeb are meshes, but path
abcdefa is not a mesh. The current through a mesh is known as mesh
current. In mesh analysis, we are interested in applying KVL to ﬁnd
the mesh currents in a given circuit.
In this section, we will apply mesh analysis to planar circuits that
do not contain current sources. In the next section, we will consider
circuits with current sources. In the mesh analysis of a circuit with n
meshes, we take the following three steps.
The shortcut way will not apply if one
mesh current is assumed clockwise
and the other assumed counter-
clockwise, although this is permissible.

The third step is to solve for the mesh currents. Putting Eqs. (3.13)
and (3.14) in matrix form yields
(3.15)
which can be solved to obtain the mesh currents 
and 
We are at
liberty to use any technique for solving the simultaneous equations.
According to Eq. (2.12), if a circuit has n nodes, b branches, and l inde-
pendent loops or meshes, then 
Hence, l independent
simultaneous equations are required to solve the circuit using mesh
analysis.
Notice that the branch currents are different from the mesh cur-
rents unless the mesh is isolated. To distinguish between the two types
of currents, we use i for a mesh current and I for a branch current. The
current elements 
and 
are algebraic sums of the mesh currents.
It is evident from Fig. 3.17 that

Mesh Analysis with Current Sources
Applying mesh analysis to circuits containing current sources (dependent
or independent) may appear complicated. But it is actually much easier
than what we encountered in the previous section, because the presence
of the current sources reduces the number of equations. Consider the
following two possible cases.
■CASE 1
When a current source exists only in one mesh: Consider
the circuit in Fig. 3.22, for example. We set 
A and write a
mesh equation for the other mesh in the usual way; that is,
(3.17)
■CASE 2
When a current source exists between two meshes: Con-
sider the circuit in Fig. 3.23(a), for example. We create a supermesh
by excluding the current source and any elements connected in series
with it, as shown in Fig. 3.23(b). Thus,
10  4i1  6(i1  i2)  0  1   i1  2 A
i2  5
3.5
As shown in Fig. 3.23(b), we create a supermesh as the periphery of
the two meshes and treat it differently. (If a circuit has two or more
supermeshes that intersect, they should be combined to form a larger
supermesh.) Why treat the supermesh differently? Because mesh analy-
sis applies KVL—which requires that we know the voltage across each
branch—and we do not know the voltage across a current source in
advance. However, a supermesh must satisfy KVL like any other mesh.
Therefore, applying KVL to the supermesh in Fig. 3.23(b) gives
20  6i1  10i2  4i2  0

or
(3.18)
We apply KCL to a node in the branch where the two meshes inter-
sect. Applying KCL to node 0 in Fig. 3.23(a) gives
(3.19)
Solving Eqs. (3.18) and (3.19), we get
(3.20)
Note the following properties of a supermesh:
1. The current source in the supermesh provides the constraint equa-
tion necessary to solve for the mesh currents.
2. A supermesh has no current of its own.
3. A supermesh requires the application of both KVL and KCL.

Nodal and Mesh Analyses 
by Inspection
This section presents a generalized procedure for nodal or mesh analy-
sis. It is a shortcut approach based on mere inspection of a circuit.
When all sources in a circuit are independent current sources, we
do not need to apply KCL to each node to obtain the node-voltage
equations as we did in Section 3.2. We can obtain the equations by
mere inspection of the circuit. As an example, let us reexamine the cir-
cuit in Fig. 3.2, shown again in Fig. 3.26(a) for convenience. The
circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equations were
derived in Section 3.2 as
(3.21)
Observe that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the conductances
connected directly to node 1 or 2, while the off-diagonal terms are the
negatives of the conductances connected between the nodes. Also, each
term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.21) is the algebraic sum of the
currents entering the node.
In general, if a circuit with independent current sources has N non-
reference nodes, the node-voltage equations can be written in terms of
the conductances as

G is called the conductance matrix; v is the output vector; and i is the
input vector. Equation (3.22) can be solved to obtain the unknown node
voltages. Keep in mind that this is valid for circuits with only inde-
pendent current sources and linear resistors.
Similarly, we can obtain mesh-current equations by inspection
when a linear resistive circuit has only independent voltage sources.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17, shown again in Fig. 3.26(b) for con-
venience. The circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equa-
tions were derived in Section 3.4 as
(3.24)
We notice that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the resistances
in the related mesh, while each of the off-diagonal terms is the nega-
tive of the resistance common to meshes 1 and 2. Each term on the
right-hand side of Eq. (3.24) is the algebraic sum taken clockwise of
all independent voltage sources in the related mesh.
In general, if the circuit has N meshes, the mesh-current equations
can be expressed in terms of the resistances as
(3.25)
or simply
(3.26)
where
Sum of the resistances in mesh k
Negative of the sum of the resistances in common
with meshes k and 
Unknown mesh current for mesh k in the clockwise direction

mesh k, with voltage rise treated as positive
R is called the resistance matrix; i is the output vector; and v is
the input vector. We can solve Eq. (3.25) to obtain the unknown mesh
currents.

Nodal Versus Mesh Analysis
Both nodal and mesh analyses provide a systematic way of analyzing
a complex network. Someone may ask: Given a network to be ana-
lyzed, how do we know which method is better or more efﬁcient? The
choice of the better method is dictated by two factors.
3.7

The ﬁrst factor is the nature of the particular network. Networks
that contain many series-connected elements, voltage sources, or super-
meshes are more suitable for mesh analysis, whereas networks with
parallel-connected elements, current sources, or supernodes are more
suitable for nodal analysis. Also, a circuit with fewer nodes than
meshes is better analyzed using nodal analysis, while a circuit with
fewer meshes than nodes is better analyzed using mesh analysis. The
key is to select the method that results in the smaller number of
equations.
The second factor is the information required. If node voltages are
required, it may be expedient to apply nodal analysis. If branch or mesh
currents are required, it may be better to use mesh analysis.
It is helpful to be familiar with both methods of analysis, for at
least two reasons. First, one method can be used to check the results
from the other method, if possible. Second, since each method has its
limitations, only one method may be suitable for a particular problem.
For example, mesh analysis is the only method to use in analyzing tran-
sistor circuits, as we shall see in Section 3.9. But mesh analysis can-
not easily be used to solve an op amp circuit, as we shall see in Chapter 5,
because there is no direct way to obtain the voltage across the op amp
itself. For nonplanar networks, nodal analysis is the only option,
because mesh analysis only applies to planar networks. Also, nodal
analysis is more amenable to solution by computer, as it is easy to pro-
gram. This allows one to analyze complicated circuits that defy hand
calculation. A computer software package based on nodal analysis is
introduced next.
Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice is a computer software circuit analysis program that we will
gradually learn to use throughout the course of this text. This section
illustrates how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze the dc circuits we
have studied so far.
The reader is expected to review Sections D.1 through D.3 of
Appendix D before proceeding in this section. It should be noted that
PSpice is only helpful in determining branch voltages and currents
when the numerical values of all the circuit components are known.

Use PSpice to ﬁnd the node voltages in the circuit of Fig. 3.31.
Solution:
The ﬁrst step is to draw the given circuit using Schematics. If one
follows the instructions given in Appendix sections D.2 and D.3, the
schematic in Fig. 3.32 is produced. Since this is a dc analysis, we use
voltage source VDC and current source IDC. The pseudocomponent
VIEWPOINTS are added to display the required node voltages. Once
the circuit is drawn and saved as exam310.sch, we run PSpice by
selecting Analysis/Simulate. The circuit is simulated and the results

Applications: DC Transistor Circuits
Most of us deal with electronic products on a routine basis and have
some experience with personal computers. A basic component for
the integrated circuits found in these electronics and computers is the
active, three-terminal device known as the transistor. Understanding
the transistor is essential before an engineer can start an electronic cir-
cuit design.
Figure 3.37 depicts various kinds of transistors commercially avail-
able. There are two basic types of transistors: bipolar junction transis-
tors (BJTs) and ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we consider only
the BJTs, which were the ﬁrst of the two and are still used today. Our
objective is to present enough detail about the BJT to enable us to apply
the techniques developed in this chapter to analyze dc transistor circuits.

Chapter 3
Methods of Analysis
William Schockley (1910–1989), John Bardeen (1908–1991), and
Walter Brattain (1902–1987) co-invented the transistor.
Nothing has had a greater impact on the transition from the “Indus-
trial Age” to the “Age of the Engineer” than the transistor. I am sure
that Dr. Shockley, Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain had no idea they would
have this incredible effect on our history. While working at Bell Lab-
oratories, they successfully demonstrated the point-contact transistor,
invented by Bardeen and Brattain in 1947, and the junction transistor,
which Shockley conceived in 1948 and successfully produced in 1951.
It is interesting to note that the idea of the ﬁeld-effect transistor,
the most commonly used one today, was ﬁrst conceived in 1925–1928
by J. E. Lilienfeld, a German immigrant to the United States. This is
evident from his patents of what appears to be a ﬁeld-effect transistor.
Unfortunately, the technology to realize this device had to wait until
1954 when Shockley’s ﬁeld-effect transistor became a reality. Just think
what today would be like if we had this transistor 30 years earlier!
For their contributions to the creation of the transistor, Dr. Shockley,
Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain received, in 1956, the Nobel Prize in
physics. It should be noted that Dr. Bardeen is the only individual to
win two Nobel prizes in physics; the second came later for work in
superconductivity at the University of Illinois.

There are two types of BJTs: npn and pnp, with their circuit sym-
bols as shown in Fig. 3.38. Each type has three terminals, designated
as emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). For the npn transistor, the
currents and voltages of the transistor are speciﬁed as in Fig. 3.39.

where 
and 
are emitter, collector, and base currents, respec-
tively. Similarly, applying KVL to Fig. 3.39(b) gives
(3.28)
where 
and 
are collector-emitter, emitter-base, and base-
collector voltages. The BJT can operate in one of three modes: active,
cutoff, and saturation. When transistors operate in the active mode, typ-
ically

is called the common-base current gain. In Eq. (3.29), 
denotes the fraction of electrons injected by the emitter that are col-
lected by the collector. Also,

where 
is known as the common-emitter current gain. The 
and 
are characteristic properties of a given transistor and assume constant
values for that transistor. Typically, 
takes values in the range of 0.98 to
0.999, while 
takes values in the range of 50 to 1000. From Eqs. (3.27)
to (3.30), it is evident that
(3.31)
and
(3.32)
These equations show that, in the active mode, the BJT can be modeled
as a dependent current-controlled current source. Thus, in circuit analy-
sis, the dc equivalent model in Fig. 3.40(b) may be used to replace the
npn transistor in Fig. 3.40(a). Since 
in Eq. (3.32) is large, a small base
current controls large currents in the output circuit. Consequently, the
bipolar transistor can serve as an ampliﬁer, producing both current gain
and voltage gain. Such ampliﬁers can be used to furnish a considerable
amount of power to transducers such as loudspeakers or control motors.

It should be observed in the following examples that one cannot
directly analyze transistor circuits using nodal analysis because of the
potential difference between the terminals of the transistor. Only when the
transistor is replaced by its equivalent model can we apply nodal analysis.
In fact, transistor circuits provide moti-
vation to study dependent sources.

Summary
1. Nodal analysis is the application of Kirchhoff’s current law at the
nonreference nodes. (It is applicable to both planar and nonplanar
circuits.) We express the result in terms of the node voltages. Solv-
ing the simultaneous equations yields the node voltages.
2. A supernode consists of two nonreference nodes connected by a
(dependent or independent) voltage source.
3. Mesh analysis is the application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law around
meshes in a planar circuit. We express the result in terms of mesh
currents. Solving the simultaneous equations yields the mesh
currents.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Enhancing Your Communication Skills
Taking a course in circuit analysis is one step in preparing yourself for
a career in electrical engineering. Enhancing your communication skills
while in school should also be part of that preparation, as a large part
of your time will be spent communicating.
People in industry have complained again and again that graduat-
ing engineers are ill-prepared in written and oral communication. An
engineer who communicates effectively becomes a valuable asset.
You can probably speak or write easily and quickly. But how effec-
tively do you communicate? The art of effective communication is of
the utmost importance to your success as an engineer.
For engineers in industry, communication is key to promotability.
Consider the result of a survey of U.S. corporations that asked what
factors inﬂuence managerial promotion. The survey includes a listing
of 22 personal qualities and their importance in advancement. You may
be surprised to note that “technical skill based on experience” placed
fourth from the bottom. Attributes such as self-conﬁdence, ambition,
ﬂexibility, maturity, ability to make sound decisions, getting things
done with and through people, and capacity for hard work all ranked
higher. At the top of the list was “ability to communicate.” The higher
your professional career progresses, the more you will need to com-
municate. Therefore, you should regard effective communication as an
important tool in your engineering tool chest.
Learning to communicate effectively is a lifelong task you should
always work toward. The best time to begin is while still in school.
Continually look for opportunities to develop and strengthen your read-
ing, writing, listening, and speaking skills. You can do this through
classroom presentations, team projects, active participation in student
organizations, and enrollment in communication courses. The risks are
less now than later in the workplace.
Ability to communicate effectively is re-
garded by many as the most important
step to an executive promotion.

Introduction
A major advantage of analyzing circuits using Kirchhoff’s laws as we
did in Chapter 3 is that we can analyze a circuit without tampering
with its original conﬁguration. A major disadvantage of this approach
is that, for a large, complex circuit, tedious computation is involved.
The growth in areas of application of electric circuits has led to an
evolution from simple to complex circuits. To handle the complexity,
engineers over the years have developed some theorems to simplify cir-
cuit analysis. Such theorems include Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems.
Since these theorems are applicable to linear circuits, we ﬁrst discuss the
concept of circuit linearity. In addition to circuit theorems, we discuss the
concepts of superposition, source transformation, and maximum power
transfer in this chapter. The concepts we develop are applied in the last
section to source modeling and resistance measurement.
Linearity Property
Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship
between cause and effect. Although the property applies to many cir-
cuit elements, we shall limit its applicability to resistors in this chap-
ter. The property is a combination of both the homogeneity (scaling)
property and the additivity property.
The homogeneity property requires that if the input (also called the
excitation) is multiplied by a constant, then the output (also called the
response) is multiplied by the same constant. For a resistor, for exam-
ple, Ohm’s law relates the input i to the output v,
(4.1)
If the current is increased by a constant k, then the voltage increases
correspondingly by k; that is,
(4.2)
The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of
inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately.
Using the voltage-current relationship of a resistor, if
(4.3a)
and
(4.3b)
then applying 
gives
(4.4)
We say that a resistor is a linear element because the voltage-current
relationship satisﬁes both the homogeneity and the additivity properties.
In general, a circuit is linear if it is both additive and homoge-
neous. A linear circuit consists of only linear elements, linear depend-
ent sources, and independent sources.

Circuit Theorems

Throughout this book we consider only linear circuits. Note that since
(making it a quadratic function rather than a linear one),
the relationship between power and voltage (or current) is nonlinear.
Therefore, the theorems covered in this chapter are not applicable to power.
To illustrate the linearity principle, consider the linear circuit
shown in Fig. 4.1. The linear circuit has no independent sources inside
it. It is excited by a voltage source 
which serves as the input. The
circuit is terminated by a load R. We may take the current i through R
as the output. Suppose

Linearity Property

A linear circuit is one whose output is linearly related (or directly pro-
portional) to its input.
For example, when current i1 ﬂows
through resistor R, the power is p1  Ri1

and when current i2 ﬂows through R, the
power is p2  Ri 2

Superposition
If a circuit has two or more independent sources, one way to determine
the value of a speciﬁc variable (voltage or current) is to use nodal or
mesh analysis as in Chapter 3. Another way is to determine the con-
tribution of each independent source to the variable and then add them
up. The latter approach is known as the superposition.
The idea of superposition rests on the linearity property.

The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current
through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the volt-
ages across (or currents through) that element due to each independ-
ent source acting alone.
Superposition is not limited to circuit
analysis but is applicable in many
ﬁelds where cause and effect bear a
linear relationship to one another.

The principle of superposition helps us to analyze a linear circuit with
more than one independent source by calculating the contribution of
each independent source separately. However, to apply the superposi-
tion principle, we must keep two things in mind:
1. We consider one independent source at a time while all other inde-
pendent sources are turned off. This implies that we replace every
voltage source by 0 V (or a short circuit), and every current source
by 0 A (or an open circuit). This way we obtain a simpler and more
manageable circuit.
2. Dependent sources are left intact because they are controlled by
circuit variables.
With these in mind, we apply the superposition principle in three
steps:
4.3
Superposition
131
Other terms such as killed, made inac-
tive, deadened, or set equal to zero
are often used to convey the same
idea.
Steps to Apply Superposition Principle:
1. Turn off all independent sources except one source. Find the
output (voltage or current) due to that active source using
the techniques covered in Chapters 2 and 3.
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the other independent sources.
3. Find the total contribution by adding algebraically all the
contributions due to the independent sources.
Analyzing a circuit using superposition has one major disadvan-
tage: It may very likely involve more work. If the circuit has three
independent sources, we may have to analyze three simpler circuits
each providing the contribution due to the respective individual source.
However, superposition does help reduce a complex circuit to simpler
circuits through replacement of voltage sources by short circuits and
of current sources by open circuits.
Keep in mind that superposition is based on linearity. For this
reason, it is not applicable to the effect on power due to each source,
because the power absorbed by a resistor depends on the square of
the voltage or current. If the power value is needed, the current
through (or voltage across) the element must be calculated ﬁrst using
superposition.

Source Transformation
We have noticed that series-parallel combination and wye-delta trans-
formation help simplify circuits. Source transformation is another tool
for simplifying circuits. Basic to these tools is the concept of equiva-
lence. We recall that an equivalent circuit is one whose v-i character-
istics are identical with the original circuit.
In Section 3.6, we saw that node-voltage (or mesh-current) equa-
tions can be obtained by mere inspection of a circuit when the sources
are all independent current (or all independent voltage) sources. It is
therefore expedient in circuit analysis to be able to substitute a voltage
source in series with a resistor for a current source in parallel with a
4.4

resistor, or vice versa, as shown in Fig. 4.15. Either substitution is
known as a source transformation.

Transformation of independent sources.
The two circuits in Fig. 4.15 are equivalent—provided they have the
same voltage-current relation at terminals 
It is easy to show that
they are indeed equivalent. If the sources are turned off, the equivalent
resistance at terminals a-b in both circuits is R. Also, when terminals
are short-circuited, the short-circuit current ﬂowing from a to b is
in the circuit on the left-hand side and 
for the circuit
on the right-hand side. Thus, 
in order for the two circuits to
be equivalent. Hence, source transformation requires that

Source transformation also applies to dependent sources, provided
we carefully handle the dependent variable. As shown in Fig. 4.16, a
dependent voltage source in series with a resistor can be transformed
to a dependent current source in parallel with the resistor or vice versa

Like the wye-delta transformation we studied in Chapter 2, a
source transformation does not affect the remaining part of the circuit.
When applicable, source transformation is a powerful tool that allows
circuit manipulations to ease circuit analysis. However, we should keep
the following points in mind when dealing with source transformation.
1. Note from Fig. 4.15 (or Fig. 4.16) that the arrow of the current source
is directed toward the positive terminal of the voltage source.
2. Note from Eq. (4.5) that source transformation is not possible when

a practical, nonideal voltage source,

rent source with

Solution:
The circuit in Fig. 4.20 involves a voltage-controlled dependent current
source. We transform this dependent current source as well as the 6-V
independent voltage source as shown in Fig. 4.21(a). The 18-V voltage
source is not transformed because it is not connected in series with any

Thevenin’s Theorem
It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is vari-
able (usually called the load) while other elements are ﬁxed. As a typ-
ical example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to different
appliances constituting a variable load. Each time the variable element
is changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoid
this problem, Thevenin’s theorem provides a technique by which the
ﬁxed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit.
According to Thevenin’s theorem, the linear circuit in Fig. 4.23(a)
can be replaced by that in Fig. 4.23(b). (The load in Fig. 4.23 may be
a single resistor or another circuit.) The circuit to the left of the ter-
minals 
in Fig. 4.23(b) is known as the Thevenin equivalent circuit;
it was developed in 1883 by M. Leon Thevenin (1857–1926), a French
telegraph engineer.

Replacing a linear two-terminal circuit
by its Thevenin equivalent: (a) original
circuit, (b) the Thevenin equivalent
circuit.
Thevenin’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be
replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source VTh in
series with a resistor RTh, where VTh is the open-circuit voltage at the
terminals and RTh is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals
when the independent sources are turned off.
The proof of the theorem will be given later, in Section 4.7. Our
major concern right now is how to ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent volt-
age 
and resistance 
. To do so, suppose the two circuits in
Fig. 4.23 are equivalent. Two circuits are said to be equivalent if they
have the same voltage-current relation at their terminals. Let us ﬁnd
out what will make the two circuits in Fig. 4.23 equivalent. If the ter-
minals 
are made open-circuited (by removing the load), no current
ﬂows, so that the open-circuit voltage across the terminals 
in
Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to the voltage source 
in Fig. 4.23(b),
since the two circuits are equivalent. Thus 
is the open-circuit volt-
age across the terminals as shown in Fig. 4.24(a); that is,

Again, with the load disconnected and terminals 
open-

(or equivalent resistance) of the dead circuit at the terminals 
in 
Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to 
in Fig. 4.23(b) because the two circuits
are equivalent. Thus, 
is the input resistance at the terminals when the

To apply this idea in ﬁnding the Thevenin resistance

is the input resistance of the network look-
ing between terminals a and b, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b). 
■CASE 2
If the network has dependent sources, we turn off all
independent sources. As with superposition, dependent sources are not
to be turned off because they are controlled by circuit variables. We
apply a voltage source 
at terminals a and b and determine the result-
ing current 
. Then 
, as shown in Fig. 4.25(a). Alterna-
tively, we may insert a current source 
at terminals a-b as shown in
Fig. 4.25(b) and ﬁnd the terminal voltage 
. Again 
. Either
of the two approaches will give the same result. In either approach we
may assume any value of 
and . For example, we may use 
or 
A, or even use unspeciﬁed values of 
or .
It often occurs that 
takes a negative value. In this case, the
negative resistance (
) implies that the circuit is supplying
power. This is possible in a circuit with dependent sources; Example 4.10
will illustrate this.
Thevenin’s theorem is very important in circuit analysis. It helps
simplify a circuit. A large circuit may be replaced by a single indepen-
dent voltage source and a single resistor. This replacement technique
is a powerful tool in circuit design.
As mentioned earlier, a linear circuit with a variable load can be
replaced by the Thevenin equivalent, exclusive of the load. The equiv-
alent network behaves the same way externally as the original circuit.
Consider a linear circuit terminated by a load 
, as shown in Fig. 4.26(a).
The current 
through the load and the voltage 
across the load are
easily determined once the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit at the
load’s terminals is obtained, as shown in Fig. 4.26(b). From Fig. 4.26(b),
we obtain
(4.8a)
(4.8b)
Note from Fig. 4.26(b) that the Thevenin equivalent is a simple volt-
age divider, yielding 
by mere inspection.

Answer:

Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) at
terminals a-b.
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned; we are to determine the
Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(a).
2. Present. The circuit contains a 
resistor in parallel with a
resistor. These are, in turn, in parallel with a dependent
current source. It is important to note that there are no
independent sources.
3. Alternative. The ﬁrst thing to consider is that, since we have no
independent sources in this circuit, we must excite the circuit
externally. In addition, when you have no independent
sources you will not have a value for 
you will only have
to ﬁnd RTh.

The simplest approach is to excite the circuit with either a
1-V voltage source or a 1-A current source. Since we will end
up with an equivalent resistance (either positive or negative), I
prefer to use the current source and nodal analysis which will
yield a voltage at the output terminals equal to the resistance
(with 1 A ﬂowing in, 
is equal to 1 times the equivalent
resistance).
As an alternative, the circuit could also be excited by a 1-V
voltage source and mesh analysis could be used to ﬁnd the
equivalent resistance.
4. Attempt. We start by writing the nodal equation at a in Fig. 4.35(b)
assuming 
(4.10.1)
Since we have two unknowns and only one equation, we will
need a constraint equation.
(4.10.2)
Substituting Eq. (4.10.2) into Eq. (4.10.1) yields
Since 
The negative value of the resistance tells us that, according
to the passive sign convention, the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) is
supplying power. Of course, the resistors in Fig. 4.35(a) cannot
supply power (they absorb power); it is the dependent source
that supplies the power. This is an example of how a
dependent source and resistors could be used to simulate
negative resistance.
5. Evaluate. First of all, we note that the answer has a negative
value. We know this is not possible in a passive circuit, but in
this circuit we do have an active device (the dependent current
source). Thus, the equivalent circuit is essentially an active
circuit that can supply power.
Now we must evaluate the solution. The best way to do this
is to perform a check, using a different approach, and see if we
obtain the same solution. Let us try connecting a 
resistor in
series with a 10-V voltage source across the output terminals of
the original circuit and then the Thevenin equivalent. To make
the circuit easier to solve, we can take and change the parallel
current source and 
resistor to a series voltage source and
resistor by using source transformation. This, with the new
load, gives us the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(c).
We can now write two mesh equations.
Note, we only have two equations but have 3 unknowns, so we
need a constraint equation. We can use

Using the Thevenin equivalent is quite easy since we have only

6. Satisfactory? Clearly we have found the value of the equivalent
circuit as required by the problem statement. Checking does
validate that solution (we compared the answer we obtained by
using the equivalent circuit with one obtained by using the load
with the original circuit). We can present all this as a solution to

Norton’s Theorem
In 1926, about 43 years after Thevenin published his theorem, E. L.
Norton, an American engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, pro-
posed a similar theorem.
4.6
Norton’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be
replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source IN in
parallel with a resistor RN, where IN is the short-circuit current through
the terminals and RN is the input or equivalent resistance at the termi-
nals when the independent sources are turned off.
Thus, the circuit in Fig. 4.37(a) can be replaced by the one in Fig. 4.37(b).
The proof of Norton’s theorem will be given in the next section.
For now, we are mainly concerned with how to get 
and 
We ﬁnd
in the same way we ﬁnd 
In fact, from what we know about
source transformation, the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal;
that is,
(4.9)
To ﬁnd the Norton current 
we determine the short-circuit current
ﬂowing from terminal a to b in both circuits in Fig. 4.37. It is evident

that the short-circuit current in Fig. 4.37(b) is 
This must be the same
short-circuit current from terminal a to b in Fig. 4.37(a), since the two
circuits are equivalent. Thus,
(4.10)
shown in Fig. 4.38. Dependent and independent sources are treated the
same way as in Thevenin’s theorem.
Observe the close relationship between Norton’s and Thevenin’s
theorems: 
as in Eq. (4.9), and
(4.11)
This is essentially source transformation. For this reason, source trans-
formation is often called Thevenin-Norton transformation.
Since 
and 
are related according to Eq. (4.11), to deter-
mine the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit requires that we ﬁnd:
• The open-circuit voltage 
across terminals a and b.
• The short-circuit current 
at terminals a and b.
• The equivalent or input resistance 
at terminals a and b when
all independent sources are turned off.
We can calculate any two of the three using the method that takes the
least effort and use them to get the third using Ohm’s law. Example 4.11
will illustrate this. Also, since
(4.12a)
(4.12b)
(4.12c)
the open-circuit and short-circuit tests are sufﬁcient to ﬁnd any Thevenin
or Norton equivalent, of a circuit which contains at least one inde-
pendent source.

Derivations of Thevenin’s and
Norton’s Theorems
In this section, we will prove Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems using
the superposition principle.
Consider the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a). It is assumed that the
circuit contains resistors and dependent and independent sources. We
have access to the circuit via terminals a and b, through which current
from an external source is applied. Our objective is to ensure that the
voltage-current relation at terminals a and b is identical to that of the
Thevenin equivalent in Fig. 4.46(b). For the sake of simplicity, sup-
pose the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a) contains two independent voltage
sources 
and 
and two independent current sources 
and 
We
may obtain any circuit variable, such as the terminal voltage v, by
applying superposition. That is, we consider the contribution due to
each independent source including the external source i. By superpo-
sition, the terminal voltage v is
(4.13)
where 
and 
are constants. Each term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (4.13) is the contribution of the related independent source;
that is, 
is the contribution to v due to the external current source i,
is the contribution due to the voltage source 
and so on. We
may collect terms for the internal independent sources together as 
so that Eq. (4.13) becomes
(4.14)
where 
We now want to evalu-
ate the values of constants 
and 
When the terminals a and b are
open-circuited, 
and 
Thus, 
is the open-circuit voltage
which is the same as 
so
(4.15)
When all the internal sources are turned off, 
The circuit can
then be replaced by an equivalent resistance 
which is the same as
and Eq. (4.14) becomes
(4.16)
Substituting the values of 
and 
in Eq. (4.14) gives
(4.17)
which expresses the voltage-current relation at terminals a and b of the
circuit in Fig. 4.46(b). Thus, the two circuits in Fig. 4.46(a) and 4.46(b)
are equivalent.
When the same linear circuit is driven by a voltage source v as
shown in Fig. 4.47(a), the current ﬂowing into the circuit can be
obtained by superposition as
(4.18)
where 
is the contribution to i due to the external voltage source v
and 
contains the contributions to i due to all internal independent
sources. When the terminals a-b are short-circuited,

Maximum Power Transfer
In many practical situations, a circuit is designed to provide power to
a load. There are applications in areas such as communications where
it is desirable to maximize the power delivered to a load. We now
address the problem of delivering the maximum power to a load when
given a system with known internal losses. It should be noted that this
will result in signiﬁcant internal losses greater than or equal to the
power delivered to the load.
The Thevenin equivalent is useful in ﬁnding the maximum power
a linear circuit can deliver to a load. We assume that we can adjust the
load resistance 
If the entire circuit is replaced by its Thevenin
equivalent except for the load, as shown in Fig. 4.48, the power deliv-
ered to the load is
(4.21)
For a given circuit, 
and 
are ﬁxed. By varying the load resist-
ance 
the power delivered to the load varies as sketched in Fig. 4.49.
We notice from Fig. 4.49 that the power is small for small or large val-
ues of 
but maximum for some value of 
between 0 and 
We
now want to show that this maximum power occurs when 
is equal
to 
This is known as the maximum power theorem.

Verifying Circuit Theorems with PSpice
In this section, we learn how to use PSpice to verify the theorems cov-
ered in this chapter. Speciﬁcally, we will consider using DC Sweep analy-
sis to ﬁnd the Thevenin or Norton equivalent at any pair of nodes in a
circuit and the maximum power transfer to a load. The reader is advised
to read Section D.3 of Appendix D in preparation for this section.
To ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit at a pair of open ter-
minals using PSpice, we use the schematic editor to draw the circuit
and insert an independent probing current source, say, Ip, at the termi-
nals. The probing current source must have a part name ISRC. We then
perform a DC Sweep on Ip, as discussed in Section D.3. Typically, we
may let the current through Ip vary from 0 to 1 A in 0.1-A increments.
After saving and simulating the circuit, we use Probe to display a plot
of the voltage across Ip versus the current through Ip. The zero inter-
cept of the plot gives us the Thevenin equivalent voltage, while the
slope of the plot is equal to the Thevenin resistance.
To ﬁnd the Norton equivalent involves similar steps except that we
insert a probing independent voltage source (with a part name VSRC),
say, Vp, at the terminals. We perform a DC Sweep on Vp and let Vp
vary from 0 to 1 V in 0.1-V increments. A plot of the current through
Vp versus the voltage across Vp is obtained using the Probe menu after
simulation. The zero intercept is equal to the Norton current, while the
slope of the plot is equal to the Norton conductance.
To ﬁnd the maximum power transfer to a load using PSpice
involves performing a DC parametric Sweep on the component value
of 
in Fig. 4.48 and plotting the power delivered to the load as a
function of

and Thevenin voltage 
at
the terminals a-b in the circuit in Fig. 4.31, we ﬁrst use Schematics to
draw the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.53(a). Notice that a probing current
source I2 is inserted at the terminals. Under Analysis/Setput, we select
DC Sweep. In the DC Sweep dialog box, we select Linear for the
Sweep Type and Current Source for the Sweep Var. Type. We enter I2
under the Name box, 0 as Start Value, 1 as End Value, and 0.1 as
Increment. After simulation, we add trace V(I2:–) from the PSpice A/D
window and obtain the plot shown in Fig. 4.53(b). From the plot, we
obtain

power transfer to 
Solution:
We need to perform a DC Sweep on 
to determine when the power
across it is maximum. We ﬁrst draw the circuit using Schematics as
shown in Fig. 4.56. Once the circuit is drawn, we take the following
three steps to further prepare the circuit for a DC Sweep.
The ﬁrst step involves deﬁning the value of 
as a parameter,
since we want to vary it. To do this:
1. DCLICKL the value 1k of R2 (representing 
) to open up the
Set Attribute Value dialog box.
2. Replace 1k with {RL} and click OK to accept the change.
Note that the curly brackets are necessary.
The second step is to deﬁne parameter. To achieve this:
1. Select Draw/Get New Part/Libraries
/special.slb.
2. Type PARAM in the PartName box and click OK.
3. DRAG the box to any position near the circuit.
4. CLICKL to end placement mode.
5. DCLICKL to open up the PartName: PARAM dialog box.
6. CLICKL on NAME1  and enter RL (with no curly brackets)
in the Value box, and CLICKL Save Attr to accept change.

The value 2k in item 7 is necessary for a bias point calculation; it

The third step is to set up the DC Sweep to sweep the parameter.
To do this:
1. Select Analysis/Setput to bring up the DC Sweep dialog box.
2. For the Sweep Type, select Linear (or Octave for a wide range
of
).
3. For the Sweep Var. Type, select Global Parameter.

6. In the End Value box, enter 5k.
7. In the Increment box, enter 100.

After taking these steps and saving the circuit, we are ready to
simulate. Select Analysis/Simulate. If there are no errors, we select

Applications
In this section we will discuss two important practical applications of
the concepts covered in this chapter: source modeling and resistance
measurement.
4.10.1
Source Modeling
Source modeling provides an example of the usefulness of the
Thevenin or the Norton equivalent. An active source such as a battery
is often characterized by its Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit. An
ideal voltage source provides a constant voltage irrespective of the cur-
rent drawn by the load, while an ideal current source supplies a con-
stant current regardless of the load voltage. As Fig. 4.58 shows,
practical voltage and current sources are not ideal, due to their inter-
nal resistances or source resistances
and 
They become ideal as

of the load on voltage sources, as shown in Fig. 4.59(a). By the volt-
age division principle, the load voltage is
(4.25)
As 
increases, the load voltage approaches a source voltage 
as
illustrated in Fig. 4.59(b). From Eq. (4.25), we should note that:
1. The load voltage will be constant if the internal resistance 
of
the source is zero or, at least, 
In other words, the
smaller

the closer the voltage source is to
being ideal.

that 
), 
Thus, 
may be regarded as the unloaded
source voltage. The connection of the load causes the terminal volt-
age to drop in magnitude; this is known as the loading effect.
The same argument can be made for a practical current source when
connected to a load as shown in Fig. 4.60(a). By the current division
principle,
(4.26)
Figure 4.60(b) shows the variation in the load current as the load resist-
ance increases. Again, we notice a drop in current due to the load (load-
ing effect), and load current is constant (ideal current source) when the
internal resistance is very large (i.e., 
or, at least, 
).
Sometimes, we need to know the unloaded source voltage 
and
the internal resistance 
of a voltage source. To ﬁnd

low the procedure illustrated in Fig. 4.61. First, we measure the open-

Then, we connect a variable load 
across the terminals as in 
Fig. 4.61(b). We adjust the resistance 
until we measure a load volt-
age of exactly one-half of the open-circuit voltage, 
because now 
At that point, we disconnect

Resistance Measurement
Although the ohmmeter method provides the simplest way to measure
resistance, more accurate measurement may be obtained using the
Wheatstone bridge. While ohmmeters are designed to measure resist-
ance in low, mid, or high range, a Wheatstone bridge is used to mea-
sure resistance in the mid range, say, between 
and 
Very low
values of resistances are measured with a milliohmmeter, while very
high values are measured with a Megger tester.
The Wheatstone bridge (or resistance bridge) circuit is used in a
number of applications. Here we will use it to measure an unknown
resistance. The unknown resistance 
is connected to the bridge as
shown in Fig. 4.63. The variable resistance is adjusted until no current
ﬂows through the galvanometer, which is essentially a d’Arsonval
movement operating as a sensitive current-indicating device like an
ammeter in the microamp range. Under this condition 
and the
bridge is said to be balanced. Since no current ﬂows through the gal-
vanometer, 
and 
behave as though they were in series; so do 
and 
. The fact that no current ﬂows through the galvanometer also
implies that 
Applying the voltage division principle,

Hence, no current ﬂows through the galvanometer when

If

vanometer, then 
How do we ﬁnd the current through the galvanometer when the
Wheatstone bridge is unbalanced? We ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent
(
and 
) with respect to the galvanometer terminals. If 
is the
resistance of the galvanometer, the current through it under the unbal-
anced condition is

Solution:
We ﬁrst need to replace the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent at
terminals a and b. The Thevenin resistance is found using the circuit
in Fig. 4.65(a). Notice that the 
and 
resistors are in parallel;
so are the

resistors. The two parallel combinations
form a series combination with respect to terminals a and b. Hence,
To ﬁnd the Thevenin voltage, we consider the circuit in Fig. 4.65(b).
Using the voltage division principle gives
Applying KVL around loop ab gives
Having determined the Thevenin equivalent, we ﬁnd the current
through the galvanometer using Fig. 4.65(c).
The negative sign indicates that the current ﬂows in the direction
opposite to the one assumed, that is, from terminal b to terminal a.

Summary
1. A linear network consists of linear elements, linear dependent
sources, and linear independent sources.
2. Network theorems are used to reduce a complex circuit to a sim-
pler one, thereby making circuit analysis much simpler.
3. The superposition principle states that for a circuit having multi-
ple independent sources, the voltage across (or current through) an
element is equal to the algebraic sum of all the individual voltages
(or currents) due to each independent source acting one at a time.
4. Source transformation is a procedure for transforming a voltage
source in series with a resistor to a current source in parallel with
a resistor, or vice versa.
5. Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems allow us to isolate a portion of
a network while the remaining portion of the network is replaced
by an equivalent network. The Thevenin equivalent consists of a
voltage source 
in series with a resistor 
while the Norton
equivalent consists of a current source 
in parallel with a resis-
tor 
The two theorems are related by source transformation.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Electronic Instrumentation
Engineering involves applying physical principles to design devices for
the beneﬁt of humanity. But physical principles cannot be understood
without measurement. In fact, physicists often say that physics is the
science that measures reality. Just as measurements are a tool for under-
standing the physical world, instruments are tools for measurement.
The operational ampliﬁer introduced in this chapter is a building block
of modern electronic instrumentation. Therefore, mastery of operational
ampliﬁer fundamentals is paramount to any practical application of
electronic circuits.
Electronic instruments are used in all ﬁelds of science and engi-
neering. They have proliferated in science and technology to the extent
that it would be ridiculous to have a scientiﬁc or technical education
without exposure to electronic instruments. For example, physicists,
physiologists, chemists, and biologists must learn to use electronic
instruments. For electrical engineering students in particular, the skill
in operating digital and analog electronic instruments is crucial. Such
instruments include ammeters, voltmeters, ohmmeters, oscilloscopes,
spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.
Beyond developing the skill for operating the instruments, some
electrical engineers specialize in designing and constructing electronic
instruments. These engineers derive pleasure in building their own
instruments. Most of them invent and patent their inventions. Special-
ists in electronic instruments ﬁnd employment in medical schools, hos-
pitals, research laboratories, aircraft industries, and thousands of other
industries where electronic instruments are routinely used.

Introduction
Having learned the basic laws and theorems for circuit analysis, we are
now ready to study an active circuit element of paramount importance:
the operational ampliﬁer, or op amp for short. The op amp is a versa-
tile circuit building block.
The op amp is an electronic unit that behaves like a voltage-controlled
voltage source.
It can also be used in making a voltage- or current-controlled current
source. An op amp can sum signals, amplify a signal, integrate it, or
differentiate it. The ability of the op amp to perform these mathemat-
ical operations is the reason it is called an operational ampliﬁer. It is
also the reason for the widespread use of op amps in analog design.
Op amps are popular in practical circuit designs because they are ver-
satile, inexpensive, easy to use, and fun to work with.
We begin by discussing the ideal op amp and later consider the
nonideal op amp. Using nodal analysis as a tool, we consider ideal op
amp circuits such as the inverter, voltage follower, summer, and dif-
ference ampliﬁer. We will also analyze op amp circuits with PSpice.
Finally, we learn how an op amp is used in digital-to-analog convert-
ers and instrumentation ampliﬁers.
Operational Ampliﬁers
An operational ampliﬁer is designed so that it performs some mathe-
matical operations when external components, such as resistors and
capacitors, are connected to its terminals. Thus, 
An op amp is an active circuit element designed to perform mathe-
matical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, dif-
ferentiation, and integration.
The op amp is an electronic device consisting of a complex
arrangement of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and diodes. A full dis-
cussion of what is inside the op amp is beyond the scope of this book.
It will sufﬁce to treat the op amp as a circuit building block and sim-
ply study what takes place at its terminals.
Op amps are commercially available in integrated circuit packages
in several forms. Figure 5.1 shows a typical op amp package. A typical
one is the eight-pin dual in-line package (or DIP), shown in Fig. 5.2(a).
Pin or terminal 8 is unused, and terminals 1 and 5 are of little concern
to us. The ﬁve important terminals are:
1. The inverting input, pin 2.
2. The noninverting input, pin 3.
3. The output, pin 6.
4. The positive power supply V, pin 7.
5. The negative power supply V, pin 4.
The circuit symbol for the op amp is the triangle in Fig. 5.2(b); as
shown, the op amp has two inputs and one output. The inputs are

purpose op amp made by Fairchild
Semiconductor.

An op amp may also be regarded as a
voltage ampliﬁer with very high gain.
The term operational ampliﬁer was in-
troduced in 1947 by John Ragazzini
and his colleagues, in their work on
analog computers for the National
Defense Research Council after World
War II. The ﬁrst op amps used vacuum
tubes rather than transistors.

marked with minus () and plus () to specify inverting and nonin-
verting inputs, respectively. An input applied to the noninverting ter-
minal will appear with the same polarity at the output, while an input
applied to the inverting terminal will appear inverted at the output.
As an active element, the op amp must be powered by a voltage
supply as typically shown in Fig. 5.3. Although the power supplies are
often ignored in op amp circuit diagrams for the sake of simplicity, the
power supply currents must not be overlooked. By KCL,
(5.1)
The equivalent circuit model of an op amp is shown in Fig. 5.4.
The output section consists of a voltage-controlled source in series with
the output resistance Ro. It is evident from Fig. 5.4 that the input resis-
tance Ri is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen at the input termi-
nals, while the output resistance Ro is the Thevenin equivalent resistance
seen at the output. The differential input voltage vd is given by
(5.2)
where v1 is the voltage between the inverting terminal and ground and
v2 is the voltage between the noninverting terminal and ground. The
op amp senses the difference between the two inputs, multiplies it by
the gain A, and causes the resulting voltage to appear at the output.
Thus, the output vo is given by
(5.3)
A is called the open-loop voltage gain because it is the gain of the op
amp without any external feedback from output to input. Table 5.1

The concept of feedback is crucial to our understanding of op amp
circuits. A negative feedback is achieved when the output is fed back
to the inverting terminal of the op amp. As Example 5.1 shows, when
there is a feedback path from output to input, the ratio of the output
voltage to the input voltage is called the closed-loop gain. As a result
of the negative feedback, it can be shown that the closed-loop gain is
almost insensitive to the open-loop gain A of the op amp. For this rea-
son, op amps are used in circuits with feedback paths.
A practical limitation of the op amp is that the magnitude of its
output voltage cannot exceed |VCC|. In other words, the output voltage
is dependent on and is limited by the power supply voltage. Figure 5.5
illustrates that the op amp can operate in three modes, depending on
the differential input voltage vd:
1. Positive saturation, vo  VCC.
2. Linear region, VCC  vo  Avd  VCC.
3. Negative saturation, vo  VCC.
If we attempt to increase vd beyond the linear range, the op amp
becomes saturated and yields vo  VCC or vo  VCC. Throughout
this book, we will assume that our op amps operate in the linear mode.
This means that the output voltage is restricted by
(5.4)
Although we shall always operate the op amp in the linear region, the
possibility of saturation must be borne in mind when one designs with
op amps, to avoid designing op amp circuits that will not work in the
laboratory.

Ideal Op Amp
To facilitate the understanding of op amp circuits, we will assume ideal
op amps. An op amp is ideal if it has the following characteristics:
1. Inﬁnite open-loop gain, 
2. Inﬁnite input resistance, 
3. Zero output resistance, Ro  0.
Ri  .
A  .
5.3

An ideal op amp is an ampliﬁer with inﬁnite open-loop gain, inﬁnite
input resistance, and zero output resistance.
Although assuming an ideal op amp provides only an approxi-
mate analysis, most modern amplifiers have such large gains and
input impedances that the approximate analysis is a good one. Unless
stated otherwise, we will assume from now on that every op amp is
ideal.
For circuit analysis, the ideal op amp is illustrated in Fig. 5.8,
which is derived from the nonideal model in Fig. 5.4. Two important
characteristics of the ideal op amp are:
1. The currents into both input terminals are zero:
(5.5)
This is due to inﬁnite input resistance. An inﬁnite resistance
between the input terminals implies that an open circuit exists there
and current cannot enter the op amp. But the output current is not
necessarily zero according to Eq. (5.1).
2. The voltage across the input terminals is equal to zero; i.e.,
(5.6)
or
(5.7)
Thus, an ideal op amp has zero current into its two input ter-
minals and the voltage between the two input terminals is equal
to zero. Equations (5.5) and (5.7) are extremely important
and should be regarded as the key handles to analyzing op amp
circuits.

tions the input port behaves as an
open circuit.
Example 5.2
Rework Practice Prob. 5.1 using the ideal op amp model.
Solution:
We may replace the op amp in Fig. 5.7 by its equivalent model in
Fig. 5.9 as we did in Example 5.1. But we do not really need to do
this. We just need to keep Eqs. (5.5) and (5.7) in mind as we analyze
the circuit in Fig. 5.7. Thus, the Fig. 5.7 circuit is presented as in
Fig. 5.9. Notice that
(5.2.1)
Since i1  0, the 40-k and 5-k resistors are in series; the same
current ﬂows through them. v1 is the voltage across the 5-k resistor.
Hence, using the voltage division principle,

loop gain,
(5.2.4)
which is very close to the value of 9.00041 obtained with the nonideal

results from assuming ideal op amp characteristics.

Inverting Ampliﬁer
In this and the following sections, we consider some useful op amp
circuits that often serve as modules for designing more complex cir-
cuits. The ﬁrst of such op amp circuits is the inverting ampliﬁer shown
in Fig. 5.10. In this circuit, the noninverting input is grounded, vi is
connected to the inverting input through R1, and the feedback resistor
Rf is connected between the inverting input and output. Our goal is to
obtain the relationship between the input voltage vi and the output volt-
age vo. Applying KCL at node 1,

(5.9)
The voltage gain is Av  vovi  RfR1. The designation of the cir-
cuit in Fig. 5.10 as an inverter arises from the negative sign. Thus,
An inverting ampliﬁer reverses the polarity of the input signal while
amplifying it.
Notice that the gain is the feedback resistance divided by the
input resistance which means that the gain depends only on the
external elements connected to the op amp. In view of Eq. (5.9), an
equivalent circuit for the inverting ampliﬁer is shown in Fig. 5.11.
The inverting ampliﬁer is used, for example, in a current-to-voltage
converter.

output voltage and the voltage gain. Application of KCL at the invert-
ing terminal gives

But v1  v2  vi. Equation (5.10) becomes
or
(5.11)
The voltage gain is Av  vovi  1  RfR1, which does not have a
negative sign. Thus, the output has the same polarity as the input.
A noninverting ampliﬁer is an op amp circuit designed to provide a
positive voltage gain.
Again we notice that the gain depends only on the external resistors.
Notice that if feedback resistor Rf  0 (short circuit) or R1  
(open circuit) or both, the gain becomes 1. Under these conditions
(Rf  0 and R1  ), the circuit in Fig. 5.16 becomes that shown
in Fig. 5.17, which is called a voltage follower (or unity gain
ampliﬁer) because the output follows the input. Thus, for a voltage
follower

Such a circuit has a very high input impedance and is therefore use-
ful as an intermediate-stage (or buffer) ampliﬁer to isolate one circuit
from another, as portrayed in Fig. 5.18. The voltage follower mini-
mizes interaction between the two stages and eliminates interstage
loading.

Summing Ampliﬁer
Besides ampliﬁcation, the op amp can perform addition and subtrac-
tion. The addition is performed by the summing ampliﬁer covered in
this section; the subtraction is performed by the difference ampliﬁer
covered in the next section.
A summing ampliﬁer is an op amp circuit that combines several inputs
and produces an output that is the weighted sum of the inputs.
The summing ampliﬁer, shown in Fig. 5.21, is a variation of the
inverting ampliﬁer. It takes advantage of the fact that the inverting con-
ﬁguration can handle many inputs at the same time. We keep in mind

Difference Ampliﬁer
Difference (or differential) ampliﬁers are used in various applications
where there is a need to amplify the difference between two input sig-
nals. They are ﬁrst cousins of the instrumentation ampliﬁer, the most
useful and popular ampliﬁer, which we will discuss in Section 5.10.
A difference ampliﬁer is a device that ampliﬁes the difference between
two inputs but rejects any signals common to the two inputs.
Consider the op amp circuit shown in Fig. 5.24. Keep in mind that
zero currents enter the op amp terminals. Applying KCL to node a,

We recognize that the ampliﬁer A3 in Fig. 5.26 is a difference ampliﬁer.
Thus, from Eq. (5.20),

Since the op amps A1 and A2 draw no current, current i ﬂows through
the three resistors as though they were in series. Hence,

Cascaded Op Amp Circuits
As we know, op amp circuits are modules or building blocks for
designing complex circuits. It is often necessary in practical applica-
tions to connect op amp circuits in cascade (i.e., head to tail) to achieve
a large overall gain. In general, two circuits are cascaded when they
are connected in tandem, one behind another in a single ﬁle.
A cascade connection is a head-to-tail arrangement of two or more op
amp circuits such that the output of one is the input of the next.
When op amp circuits are cascaded, each circuit in the string is
called a stage; the original input signal is increased by the gain of the
individual stage. Op amp circuits have the advantage that they can be
cascaded without changing their input-output relationships. This is due to
the fact that each (ideal) op amp circuit has inﬁnite input resistance and
zero output resistance. Figure 5.28 displays a block diagram represen-
tation of three op amp circuits in cascade. Since the output of one stage
is the input to the next stage, the overall gain of the cascade connection
is the product of the gains of the individual op amp circuits, or
(5.22)
Although the cascade connection does not affect the op amp input-
output relationships, care must be exercised in the design of an actual
op amp circuit to ensure that the load due to the next stage in the cas-
cade does not saturate the op amp.

Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned.
2. Present. With an input of v1 of 1 V and of v2 of 2 V, determine
the output voltage of the circuit shown in Figure 5.31. The op
amp circuit is actually composed of three circuits. The ﬁrst
circuit acts as an ampliﬁer of gain 3(6 k2 k) for v1 and
the second functions as an ampliﬁer of gain 2(8 k4 k)
for v2. The last circuit serves as a summer of two different gains
for the output of the other two circuits.

as v22. Then we get

5. Evaluate. In order to properly evaluate our solution, we need to
identify a reasonable check. Here we can easily use PSpice to
provide that check.
Now we can simulate this in PSpice. We see the results are

We note that we obtain the same results using two entirely
different techniques (the ﬁrst is to treat the op amp circuits as
just gains and a summer and the second is to use circuit analysis
with PSpice). This is a very good method of assuring that we
have the correct answer.

Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice for Windows does not have a model for an ideal op amp, although
one may create one as a subcircuit using the Create Subcircuit line in
the Tools menu. Rather than creating an ideal op amp, we will use one
of the four nonideal, commercially available op amps supplied in the
PSpice library eval.slb. The op amp models have the part names LF411,
LM111, LM324, and uA741, as shown in Fig. 5.34. Each of them can
be obtained from Draw/Get New Part/libraries . . . /eval.lib or by sim-
ply selecting Draw/Get New Part and typing the part name in the
PartName dialog box, as usual. Note that each of them requires dc sup-
plies, without which the op amp will not work. The dc supplies should
be connected as shown in Fig. 5.3.

Fig. 5.35. Notice that the positive terminal of the voltage source vs is
connected to the inverting terminal (pin 2) via the 10-k resistor, while
the noninverting terminal (pin 3) is grounded as required in Fig. 5.6(a).
Also, notice how the op amp is powered; the positive power supply
terminal V (pin 7) is connected to a 15-V dc voltage source, while
the negative power supply terminal V (pin 4) is connected to 15 V.
Pins 1 and 5 are left ﬂoating because they are used for offset null
adjustment, which does not concern us in this chapter. Besides adding
the dc power supplies to the original circuit in Fig. 5.6(a), we have also
added pseudocomponents VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to respectively
measure the output voltage vo at pin 6 and the required current i

Applications
The op amp is a fundamental building block in modern electronic
instrumentation. It is used extensively in many devices, along with
resistors and other passive elements. Its numerous practical applications
include instrumentation ampliﬁers, digital-to-analog converters, analog
computers, level shifters, ﬁlters, calibration circuits, inverters, sum-
mers, integrators, differentiators, subtractors, logarithmic ampliﬁers,
comparators, gyrators, oscillators, rectiﬁers, regulators, voltage-to-
current converters, current-to-voltage converters, and clippers. Some of
these we have already considered. We will consider two more applica-
tions here: the digital-to-analog converter and the instrumentation
ampliﬁer.
5.10.1
Digital-to-Analog Converter
The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) transforms digital signals into
analog form. A typical example of a four-bit DAC is illustrated in
Fig. 5.36(a). The four-bit DAC can be realized in many ways. A sim-
ple realization is the binary weighted ladder, shown in Fig. 5.36(b).
The bits are weights according to the magnitude of their place value,
by descending value of RfRn so that each lesser bit has half the
weight of the next higher. This is obviously an inverting summing
ampliﬁer. The output is related to the inputs as shown in Eq. (5.15).
Thus,
(5.23)
Input V1 is called the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB), while input V4 is the
least signiﬁcant bit (LSB). Each of the four binary inputs V1, . . . , V4
can assume only two voltage levels: 0 or 1 V. By using the proper input
and feedback resistor values, the DAC provides a single output that is
proportional to the inputs.

Solution:
Substituting the given values of the input and feedback resistors in
Eq. (5.23) gives
Using this equation, a digital input [V1V2V3V4]  [0000] produces an ana-
log output of Vo  0 V; [V1V2V3V4]  [0001] gives Vo  0.125 V.

Table 5.2 summarizes the result of the digital-to-analog conversion.
Note that we have assumed that each bit has a value of 0.125 V. Thus,
in this system, we cannot represent a voltage between 1.000 and 1.125,
for example. This lack of resolution is a major limitation of digital-to-
analog conversions. For greater accuracy, a word representation with a
greater number of bits is required. Even then a digital representation
of an analog voltage is never exact. In spite of this inexact represen-
tation, digital representation has been used to accomplish remarkable
things such as audio CDs and digital photography.

Instrumentation Ampliﬁers
One of the most useful and versatile op amp circuits for precision
measurement and process control is the instrumentation ampliﬁer (IA),
so called because of its widespread use in measurement systems. Typ-
ical applications of IAs include isolation ampliﬁers, thermocouple
ampliﬁers, and data acquisition systems.
The instrumentation ampliﬁer is an extension of the difference
ampliﬁer in that it ampliﬁes the difference between its input signals.
As shown in Fig. 5.26 (see Example 5.8), an instrumentation ampliﬁer
typically consists of three op amps and seven resistors. For conven-
ience, the ampliﬁer is shown again in Fig. 5.38(a), where the resistors are
made equal except for the external gain-setting resistor RG, connected
between the gain set terminals. Figure 5.38(b) shows its schematic
symbol. Example 5.8 showed that

voltages. Since the common-mode voltages are equal, they cancel each
other.
The IA has three major characteristics:
1. The voltage gain is adjusted by one external resistor RG.
2. The input impedance of both inputs is very high and does not vary
as the gain is adjusted.
3. The output vo depends on the difference between the inputs v1
and v2, not on the voltage common to them (common-mode
voltage).
Due to the widespread use of IAs, manufacturers have developed
these ampliﬁers on single-package units. A typical example is the
LH0036, developed by National Semiconductor. The gain can be var-
ied from 1 to 1,000 by an external resistor whose value may vary from
100  to 10 k.

Summary
1. The op amp is a high-gain ampliﬁer that has high input resistance
and low output resistance.
2. Table 5.3 summarizes the op amp circuits considered in this chap-
ter. The expression for the gain of each ampliﬁer circuit holds
whether the inputs are dc, ac, or time-varying in general.

3. An ideal op amp has an inﬁnite input resistance, a zero output
resistance, and an inﬁnite gain.
4. For an ideal op amp, the current into each of its two input termi-
nals is zero, and the voltage across its input terminals is negligi-
bly small.
5. In an inverting ampliﬁer, the output voltage is a negative multiple
of the input.
6. In a noninverting ampliﬁer, the output is a positive multiple of the
input.
7. In a voltage follower, the output follows the input.
8. In a summing ampliﬁer, the output is the weighted sum of the
inputs.
9. In a difference ampliﬁer, the output is proportional to the differ-
ence of the two inputs.
10. Op amp circuits may be cascaded without changing their input-
output relationships.
11. PSpice can be used to analyze an op amp circuit.
12. Typical applications of the op amp considered in this chapter include
the digital-to-analog converter and the instrumentation ampliﬁer.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.c), “an ability to design a system,
component, or process to meet desired needs.”
The “ability to design a system, component, or process to meet
desired needs” is why engineers are hired. That is why this is the
most important technical skill that an engineer has. Interestingly, your
success as an engineer is directly proportional to your ability to com-
municate but your being able to design is why you will be hired in
the ﬁrst place.
Design takes place when you have what is termed an open-ended
problem that eventually is deﬁned by the solution. Within the context
of this course or textbook, we can only explore some of the elements
of design. Pursuing all of the steps of our problem-solving technique
teaches you several of the most important elements of the design
process.
Probably the most important part of design is clearly deﬁning what
the system, component, process, or, in our case, problem is. Rarely is
an engineer given a perfectly clear assignment. Therefore, as a student,
you can develop and enhance this skill by asking yourself, your col-
leagues, or your professors questions designed to clarify the problem
statement.
Exploring alternative solutions is another important part of the
design process. Again, as a student, you can practice this part of the
design process on almost every problem you work.
Evaluating your solutions is critical to any engineering assignment.
Again, this is a skill that you as a student can practice on every prob-
lem you work.

Introduction
So far we have limited our study to resistive circuits. In this chapter,
we shall introduce two new and important passive linear circuit ele-
ments: the capacitor and the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipate
energy, capacitors and inductors do not dissipate but store energy,
which can be retrieved at a later time. For this reason, capacitors and
inductors are called storage elements.
The application of resistive circuits is quite limited. With the intro-
duction of capacitors and inductors in this chapter, we will be able to
analyze more important and practical circuits. Be assured that the cir-
cuit analysis techniques covered in Chapters 3 and 4 are equally appli-
cable to circuits with capacitors and inductors.
We begin by introducing capacitors and describing how to com-
bine them in series or in parallel. Later, we do the same for inductors.
As typical applications, we explore how capacitors are combined with
op amps to form integrators, differentiators, and analog computers.
Capacitors
A capacitor is a passive element designed to store energy in its elec-
tric ﬁeld. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electrical
components. Capacitors are used extensively in electronics, communi-
cations, computers, and power systems. For example, they are used in
the tuning circuits of radio receivers and as dynamic memory elements
in computer systems.
A capacitor is typically constructed as depicted in Fig. 6.1.

Capacitors and Inductors
In contrast to a resistor, which spends
or dissipates energy irreversibly, an
inductor or capacitor stores or releases
energy (i.e., has a memory).

Alternatively, capacitance is the amount
of charge stored per plate for a unit
voltage difference in a capacitor.
A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by an insu-
lator (or dielectric).
In many practical applications, the plates may be aluminum foil while
the dielectric may be air, ceramic, paper, or mica.
When a voltage source 
is connected to the capacitor, as in
Fig. 6.2, the source deposits a positive charge q on one plate and a neg-
ative charge 
on the other. The capacitor is said to store the electric
charge. The amount of charge stored, represented by q, is directly pro-
portional to the applied voltage 
so that
(6.1)
where C, the constant of proportionality, is known as the capacitance
of the capacitor. The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), in honor of
the English physicist Michael Faraday (1791–1867). From Eq. (6.1),
we may derive the following deﬁnition.
q  Cv
v
q

Capacitance is the ratio of the charge on one plate of a capacitor to
the voltage difference between the two plates, measured in farads (F).
Note from Eq. (6.1) that 1 farad  1 coulomb/volt.

Although the capacitance C of a capacitor is the ratio of the charge
q per plate to the applied voltage
it does not depend on q or
It
depends on the physical dimensions of the capacitor. For example, for
the parallel-plate capacitor shown in Fig. 6.1, the capacitance is given by
(6.2)
where A is the surface area of each plate, d is the distance between
the plates, and 
is the permittivity of the dielectric material between
the plates. Although Eq. (6.2) applies to only parallel-plate capacitors,
we may infer from it that, in general, three factors determine the value
of the capacitance:
1. The surface area of the plates—the larger the area, the greater the
capacitance.
2. The spacing between the plates—the smaller the spacing, the greater
the capacitance.
3. The permittivity of the material—the higher the permittivity, the
greater the capacitance.
Capacitors are commercially available in different values and types.
Typically, capacitors have values in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad 
range. They are described by the dielectric material they are made of and
by whether they are of ﬁxed or variable type. Figure 6.3 shows the cir-
cuit symbols for ﬁxed and variable capacitors. Note that according to the
passive sign convention, if 
and 
or if 
and 
the
capacitor is being charged, and if 
the capacitor is discharging.
Figure 6.4 shows common types of ﬁxed-value capacitors. Poly-
ester capacitors are light in weight, stable, and their change with tem-
perature is predictable. Instead of polyester, other dielectric materials
such as mica and polystyrene may be used. Film capacitors are rolled
and housed in metal or plastic ﬁlms. Electrolytic capacitors produce
very high capacitance. Figure 6.5 shows the most common types of
variable capacitors. The capacitance of a trimmer (or padder) capacitor

Michael Faraday (1791–1867), an English chemist and physicist,
was probably the greatest experimentalist who ever lived.
Born near London, Faraday realized his boyhood dream by work-
ing with the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institu-
tion, where he worked for 54 years. He made several contributions
in all areas of physical science and coined such words as electroly-
sis, anode, and cathode. His discovery of electromagnetic induction
in 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering because it provided
a way of generating electricity. The electric motor and generator oper-
ate on this principle. The unit of capacitance, the farad, was named
in his honor.
Historical
Capacitor voltage rating and capaci-
tance are typically inversely rated due
to the relationships in Eqs. (6.1) and
(6.2). Arcing occurs if d is small and V
is high.

is often placed in parallel with another capacitor so that the equivalent
capacitance can be varied slightly. The capacitance of the variable air
capacitor (meshed plates) is varied by turning the shaft. Variable capac-
itors are used in radio receivers allowing one to tune to various sta-
tions. In addition, capacitors are used to block dc, pass ac, shift phase,
store energy, start motors, and suppress noise.
To obtain the current-voltage relationship of the capacitor, we take
the derivative of both sides of Eq. (6.1). Since
(6.3)
differentiating both sides of Eq. (6.1) gives
(6.4)
This is the current-voltage relationship for a capacitor, assuming the
passive sign convention. The relationship is illustrated in Fig. 6.6 for
a capacitor whose capacitance is independent of voltage. Capacitors
that satisfy Eq. (6.4) are said to be linear. For a nonlinear capacitor,
the plot of the current-voltage relationship is not a straight line.
Although some capacitors are nonlinear, most are linear. We will
assume linear capacitors in this book.
The voltage-current relation of the capacitor can be obtained by
integrating both sides of Eq. (6.4). We get

Thus,
(6.9)
Using Eq. (6.1), we may rewrite Eq. (6.9) as
(6.10)
Equation (6.9) or (6.10) represents the energy stored in the electric ﬁeld
that exists between the plates of the capacitor. This energy can be
retrieved, since an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy. In fact, the
word capacitor is derived from this element’s capacity to store energy
in an electric ﬁeld.
We should note the following important properties of a capacitor:
1. Note from Eq. (6.4) that when the voltage across a capacitor is not
changing with time (i.e., dc voltage), the current through the capac-
itor is zero. Thus,

Capacitors

A capacitor is an open circuit to dc.
However, if a battery (dc voltage) is connected across a capacitor,
the capacitor charges.
2. The voltage on the capacitor must be continuous.
The voltage on a capacitor cannot change abruptly.
The capacitor resists an abrupt change in the voltage across it.
According to Eq. (6.4), a discontinuous change in voltage requires
an inﬁnite current, which is physically impossible. For example,
the voltage across a capacitor may take the form shown in
Fig. 6.7(a), whereas it is not physically possible for the capacitor
voltage to take the form shown in Fig. 6.7(b) because of the abrupt
changes. Conversely, the current through a capacitor can change
instantaneously.
3. The ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. It takes power from
the circuit when storing energy in its ﬁeld and returns previously
stored energy when delivering power to the circuit.
4. A real, nonideal capacitor has a parallel-model leakage resistance,
as shown in Fig. 6.8. The leakage resistance may be as high as
v

(b)
Figure 6.7
Voltage across a capacitor: (a) allowed,
(b) not allowable; an abrupt change is not
possible.
An alternative way of looking at this is
using Eq. (6.9), which indicates that
energy is proportional to voltage
squared. Since injecting or extracting
energy can only be done over some
ﬁnite time, voltage cannot change
instantaneously across a capacitor.

powerful tool for reducing circuits. This technique can be extended to
series-parallel connections of capacitors, which are sometimes encoun-
tered. We desire to replace these capacitors by a single equivalent
capacitor 
In order to obtain the equivalent capacitor

Inductors
An inductor is a passive element designed to store energy in its mag-
netic ﬁeld. Inductors ﬁnd numerous applications in electronic and
power systems. They are used in power supplies, transformers, radios,
TVs, radars, and electric motors.
Any conductor of electric current has inductive properties and may
be regarded as an inductor. But in order to enhance the inductive effect,
a practical inductor is usually formed into a cylindrical coil with many
turns of conducting wire, as shown in Fig. 6.21.
6.4
226
Chapter 6
Capacitors and Inductors
An inductor consists of a coil of conducting wire.
If current is allowed to pass through an inductor, it is found that the
voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to the time rate of
change of the current. Using the passive sign convention,
(6.18)
where L is the constant of proportionality called the inductance of the
inductor. The unit of inductance is the henry (H), named in honor of
the American inventor Joseph Henry (1797–1878). It is clear from
Eq. (6.18) that 1 henry equals 1 volt-second per ampere.

Typical form of an inductor.
In view of Eq. (6.18), for an inductor
to have voltage across its terminals, its
current must vary with time. Hence,
v  0 for constant current through
the inductor.
Inductance is the property whereby an inductor exhibits opposition
to the change of current ﬂowing through it, measured in henrys (H).
The inductance of an inductor depends on its physical dimension
and construction. Formulas for calculating the inductance of inductors
of different shapes are derived from electromagnetic theory and can be
found in standard electrical engineering handbooks. For example, for
the inductor, (solenoid) shown in Fig. 6.21,
(6.19)
where N is the number of turns, 
is the length, A is the cross-sectional
area, and 
is the permeability of the core. We can see from Eq. (6.19)
that inductance can be increased by increasing the number of turns of
coil, using material with higher permeability as the core, increasing the
cross-sectional area, or reducing the length of the coil.
Like capacitors, commercially available inductors come in differ-
ent values and types. Typical practical inductors have inductance values
ranging from a few microhenrys (
), as in communication systems,
to tens of henrys (H) as in power systems. Inductors may be ﬁxed or
variable. The core may be made of iron, steel, plastic, or air. The terms
coil and choke are also used for inductors. Common inductors are
shown in Fig. 6.22. The circuit symbols for inductors are shown in
Fig. 6.23, following the passive sign convention.
Equation (6.18) is the voltage-current relationship for an inductor.

inductance is independent of current. Such an inductor is known as a
linear inductor. For a nonlinear inductor, the plot of Eq. (6.18) will
not be a straight line because its inductance varies with current. We
will assume linear inductors in this textbook unless stated otherwise.
The current-voltage relationship is obtained from Eq. (6.18) as

the inductor is

Inductors

Joseph Henry (1797–1878), an American physicist, discovered induc-
tance and constructed an electric motor.
Born in Albany, New York, Henry graduated from Albany Acad-
emy and taught philosophy at Princeton University from 1832 to 1846.
He was the ﬁrst secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He conducted
several experiments on electromagnetism and developed powerful elec-
tromagnets that could lift objects weighing thousands of pounds. Inter-
estingly, Joseph Henry discovered electromagnetic induction before
Faraday but failed to publish his ﬁndings. The unit of inductance, the
henry, was named after him.

Since 
(6.24)
We should note the following important properties of an inductor.
1. Note from Eq. (6.18) that the voltage across an inductor is zero
when the current is constant. Thus,
w  1
2
 Li2
i ()  0,
228
Chapter 6
Capacitors and Inductors
An inductor acts like a short circuit to dc.
2. An important property of the inductor is its opposition to the
change in current ﬂowing through it.
The current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously.
According to Eq. (6.18), a discontinuous change in the current
through an inductor requires an inﬁnite voltage, which is not phys-
ically possible. Thus, an inductor opposes an abrupt change in the
current through it. For example, the current through an inductor
may take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(a), whereas the inductor cur-
rent cannot take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(b) in real-life situa-
tions due to the discontinuities. However, the voltage across an
inductor can change abruptly.
3. Like the ideal capacitor, the ideal inductor does not dissipate
energy. The energy stored in it can be retrieved at a later time. The
inductor takes power from the circuit when storing energy and
delivers power to the circuit when returning previously stored
energy.
4. A practical, nonideal inductor has a signiﬁcant resistive component,
as shown in Fig. 6.26. This is due to the fact that the inductor is
made of a conducting material such as copper, which has some
resistance. This resistance is called the winding resistance
, and
it appears in series with the inductance of the inductor. The pres-
ence of 
makes it both an energy storage device and an energy
dissipation device. Since 
is usually very small, it is ignored in
most cases. The nonideal inductor also has a winding capacitance
due to the capacitive coupling between the conducting coils. 
is very small and can be ignored in most cases, except at high fre-
quencies. We will assume ideal inductors in this book.

Series and Parallel Inductors
Now that the inductor has been added to our list of passive elements, it is
necessary to extend the powerful tool of series-parallel combination. We
need to know how to ﬁnd the equivalent inductance of a series-connected
or parallel-connected set of inductors found in practical circuits.
Consider a series connection of N inductors, as shown in Fig. 6.29(a),

Circuit elements such as resistors and capacitors are commercially
available in either discrete form or integrated-circuit (IC) form. Unlike
capacitors and resistors, inductors with appreciable inductance are dif-
ﬁcult to produce on IC substrates. Therefore, inductors (coils) usually

come in discrete form and tend to be more bulky and expensive. For
this reason, inductors are not as versatile as capacitors and resistors,
and they are more limited in applications. However, there are several
applications in which inductors have no practical substitute. They are
routinely used in relays, delays, sensing devices, pick-up heads, tele-
phone circuits, radio and TV receivers, power supplies, electric motors,
microphones, and loudspeakers, to mention a few.
Capacitors and inductors possess the following three special prop-
erties that make them very useful in electric circuits:
1. The capacity to store energy makes them useful as temporary volt-
age or current sources. Thus, they can be used for generating a large
amount of current or voltage for a short period of time.
2. Capacitors oppose any abrupt change in voltage, while inductors
oppose any abrupt change in current. This property makes induc-
tors useful for spark or arc suppression and for converting pulsat-
ing dc voltage into relatively smooth dc voltage.
3. Capacitors and inductors are frequency sensitive. This property
makes them useful for frequency discrimination.
The ﬁrst two properties are put to use in dc circuits, while the third
one is taken advantage of in ac circuits. We will see how useful these
properties are in later chapters. For now, consider three applications
involving capacitors and op amps: integrator, differentiator, and analog
computer.
6.6.1
Integrator
Important op amp circuits that use energy-storage elements include
integrators and differentiators. These op amp circuits often involve
resistors and capacitors; inductors (coils) tend to be more bulky and
expensive.
The op amp integrator is used in numerous applications, especially
in analog computers, to be discussed in Section 6.6.3.

Capacitors and Inductors
An integrator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to the
integral of the input signal.
If the feedback resistor 
in the familiar inverting ampliﬁer of
Fig. 6.35(a) is replaced by a capacitor, we obtain an ideal integrator,
as shown in Fig. 6.35(b). It is interesting that we can obtain a mathe-
matical representation of integration this way. At node a in Fig. 6.35(b),

ration. Care must be taken that the op amp operates within the linear
range so that it does not saturate.

Differentiator
A differentiator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to
the rate of change of the input signal.

resulting circuit is a differentiator, shown in Fig. 6.37. Applying KCL

But
Substituting these in Eq. (6.36) yields

showing that the output is the derivative of the input. Differentiator cir-
cuits are electronically unstable because any electrical noise within the
circuit is exaggerated by the differentiator. For this reason, the differ-
entiator circuit in Fig. 6.37 is not as useful and popular as the inte-
grator. It is seldom used in practice.

6.6.3
Analog Computer
Op amps were initially developed for electronic analog computers.
Analog computers can be programmed to solve mathematical models of
mechanical or electrical systems. These models are usually expressed in
terms of differential equations.
To solve simple differential equations using the analog computer
requires cascading three types of op amp circuits: integrator circuits,
summing ampliﬁers, and inverting/noninverting ampliﬁers for negative/
positive scaling. The best way to illustrate how an analog computer solves
a differential equation is with an example.
Suppose we desire the solution 
of the equation
(6.38)
where a, b, and c are constants, and 
is an arbitrary forcing func-
tion. The solution is obtained by ﬁrst solving the highest-order deriv-
ative term. Solving for 
yields
(6.39)
To obtain 
, the 
term is integrated and inverted. Finally,
to obtain x, the 
term is integrated and inverted. The forcing func-
tion is injected at the proper point. Thus, the analog computer for solv-
ing Eq. (6.38) is implemented by connecting the necessary summers,
inverters, and integrators. A plotter or oscilloscope may be used to view
the output x, or 
or 
depending on where it is connected
in the system.
Although the above example is on a second-order differential equa-
tion, any differential equation can be simulated by an analog computer
comprising integrators, inverters, and inverting summers. But care must
be exercised in selecting the values of the resistors and capacitors, to
ensure that the op amps do not saturate during the solution time interval.
The analog computers with vacuum tubes were built in the 1950s and
1960s. Recently their use has declined. They have been superseded by
modern digital computers. However, we still study analog computers for
two reasons. First, the availability of integrated op amps has made it pos-
sible to build analog computers easily and cheaply. Second, understand-
ing analog computers helps with the appreciation of the digital computers.

require much more effort. If this is so, then you should always
keep in mind that time spent here will result in much less effort
later and most likely save you a lot of frustration in the process.
2. Present. Clearly, using the devices developed in Section 6.6.3
will allow us to create the desired analog computer circuit. We
will need the integrator circuits (possibly combined with a
summing capability) and one or more inverter circuits.
3. Alternative. The approach for solving this problem is straight-
forward. We will need to pick the correct values of resistances
and capacitors to allow us to realize the equation we are repre-
senting. The ﬁnal output of the circuit will give the desired result.
4. Attempt. There are an inﬁnite number of possibilities for
picking the resistors and capacitors, many of which will result
in correct solutions. Extreme values of resistors and capacitors
will result in incorrect outputs. For example, low values of
resistors will overload the electronics. Picking values of
resistors that are too large will cause the op amps to stop
functioning as ideal devices. The limits can be determined from
the characteristics of the real op amp.
We ﬁrst solve for the second derivative as
(6.15.1)
Solving this requires some mathematical operations, including
summing, scaling, and integration. Integrating both sides of
Eq. (6.15.1) gives
(6.15.2)
where 
We implement Eq. (6.15.2) using the summing
integrator shown in Fig. 6.40(a). The values of the resistors and
capacitors have been chosen so that 
for the term
Other terms in the summing integrator of Eq. (6.15.2) are
implemented accordingly. The initial condition 
is
implemented by connecting a 1-V battery with a switch across the
capacitor as shown in Fig. 6.40(a).
The next step is to obtain 
by integrating 
and
inverting the result,
(6.15.3)
This is implemented with the circuit in Fig. 6.40(b) with the
battery giving the initial condition of 
V. We now combine the
two circuits in Fig. 6.40(a) and (b) to obtain the complete circuit
shown in Fig. 6.40(c). When the input signal 
is applied,
we open the switches at 
to obtain the output waveform 
,
which may be viewed on an oscilloscope.

5. Evaluate. The answer looks correct, but is it? If an actual
solution for 
is desired, then a good check would be to ﬁrst
ﬁnd the solution by realizing the circuit in PSpice. This result
could then be compared with a solution using the differential
solution capability of MATLAB.
Since all we need to do is check the circuit and conﬁrm that
it represents the equation, we have an easier technique to use.
We just go through the circuit and see if it generates the desired
equation.
However, we still have choices to make. We could go through
the circuit from left to right but that would involve differentiating
the result to obtain the original equation. An easier approach
would be to go from right to left. This is the approach we will
use to check the answer.
Starting with the output, 
we see that the right-hand op
amp is nothing more than an inverter with a gain of one. This
means that the output of the middle circuit is

Enhancing Your Career
Careers in Computer Engineering 
Electrical engineering education has gone through drastic changes in
recent decades. Most departments have come to be known as Department
of Electrical and Computer Engineering, emphasizing the rapid changes
due to computers. Computers occupy a prominent place in modern soci-
ety and education. They have become commonplace and are helping to
change the face of research, development, production, business, and enter-
tainment. The scientist, engineer, doctor, attorney, teacher, airline pilot,
businessperson—almost anyone beneﬁts from a computer’s abilities to
store large amounts of information and to process that information in very
short periods of time. The internet, a computer communication network,
is essential in business, education, and library science. Computer usage
continues to grow by leaps and bounds.
An education in computer engineering should provide breadth in soft-
ware, hardware design, and basic modeling techniques. It should include
courses in data structures, digital systems, computer architecture, micro-
processors, interfacing, software engineering, and operating systems.
Electrical engineers who specialize in computer engineering ﬁnd
jobs in computer industries and in numerous ﬁelds where computers
are being used. Companies that produce software are growing rapidly
in number and size and providing employment for those who are skilled
in programming. An excellent way to advance one’s knowledge of
computers is to join the IEEE Computer Society, which sponsors
diverse magazines, journals, and conferences.

A ﬁrst-order circuit is characterized by a ﬁrst-order differential
equation.
Introduction
Now that we have considered the three passive elements (resistors,
capacitors, and inductors) and one active element (the op amp) indi-
vidually, we are prepared to consider circuits that contain various com-
binations of two or three of the passive elements. In this chapter, we
shall examine two types of simple circuits: a circuit comprising a resis-
tor and capacitor and a circuit comprising a resistor and an inductor.
These are called RC and RL circuits, respectively. As simple as these
circuits are, they ﬁnd continual applications in electronics, communi-
cations, and control systems, as we shall see.
We carry out the analysis of RC and RL circuits by applying
Kirchhoff’s laws, as we did for resistive circuits. The only difference
is that applying Kirchhoff’s laws to purely resistive circuits results in
algebraic equations, while applying the laws to RC and RL circuits pro-
duces differential equations, which are more difﬁcult to solve than
algebraic equations. The differential equations resulting from analyz-
ing RC and RL circuits are of the ﬁrst order. Hence, the circuits are
collectively known as ﬁrst-order circuits.
7.1

Chapter 7
First-Order Circuits
In addition to there being two types of ﬁrst-order circuits (RC and
RL), there are two ways to excite the circuits. The ﬁrst way is by ini-
tial conditions of the storage elements in the circuits. In these so-called
source-free circuits, we assume that energy is initially stored in the
capacitive or inductive element. The energy causes current to ﬂow in
the circuit and is gradually dissipated in the resistors. Although source-
free circuits are by deﬁnition free of independent sources, they may
have dependent sources. The second way of exciting ﬁrst-order circuits
is by independent sources. In this chapter, the independent sources we
will consider are dc sources. (In later chapters, we shall consider sinu-
soidal and exponential sources.) The two types of ﬁrst-order circuits
and the two ways of exciting them add up to the four possible situa-
tions we will study in this chapter.
Finally, we consider four typical applications of RC and RL cir-
cuits: delay and relay circuits, a photoﬂash unit, and an automobile
ignition circuit.
The Source-Free RC Circuit
A source-free RC circuit occurs when its dc source is suddenly dis-
connected. The energy already stored in the capacitor is released to the
resistors.
Consider a series combination of a resistor and an initially charged
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.1. (The resistor and capacitor may be the
equivalent resistance and equivalent capacitance of combinations of
resistors and capacitors.) Our objective is to determine the circuit
response, which, for pedagogic reasons, we assume to be the voltage

can assume that at time 
the initial voltage is

with the corresponding value of the energy stored as

Applying KCL at the top node of the circuit in Fig. 7.1 yields

Thus,
(7.4a)
or
(7.4b)
This is a ﬁrst-order differential equation, since only the ﬁrst derivative
of v is involved. To solve it, we rearrange the terms as
(7.5)
Integrating both sides, we get
where 
is the integration constant. Thus,
(7.6)
Taking powers of e produces
But from the initial conditions, 
Hence,
(7.7)
This shows that the voltage response of the RC circuit is an exponen-
tial decay of the initial voltage. Since the response is due to the initial
energy stored and the physical characteristics of the circuit and not due
to some external voltage or current source, it is called the natural
response of the circuit.

The time constant of a circuit is the time required for the response to
decay to a factor of 1e or 36.8 percent of its initial value.1
This implies that at 
Eq. (7.7) becomes
or
(7.8)
In terms of the time constant, Eq. (7.7) can be written as
(7.9)
With a calculator it is easy to show that the value of 
is as
shown in Table 7.1. It is evident from Table 7.1 that the voltage 
is less than 
percent of 
after 
(ﬁve time constants). Thus, it is
customary to assume that the capacitor is fully discharged (or charged)
after ﬁve time constants. In other words, it takes 
for the circuit to
reach its ﬁnal state or steady state when no changes take place with
time. Notice that for every time interval of 
the voltage is reduced
by 36.8 percent of its previous value, 
regardless of the value of t.
Observe from Eq. (7.8) that the smaller the time constant, the more
rapidly the voltage decreases, that is, the faster the response. This is
illustrated in Fig. 7.4. A circuit with a small time constant gives a fast
response in that it reaches the steady state (or ﬁnal state) quickly due
to quick dissipation of energy stored, whereas a circuit with a large
time constant gives a slow response because it takes longer to reach
steady state. At any rate, whether the time constant is small or large,
the circuit reaches steady state in ﬁve time constants.
With the voltage 
in Eq. (7.9), we can ﬁnd the current

one can use Thevenin’s theorem when
several inductors can be combined to
form a single equivalent inductor.
Assuming that 
calculate 
and 
in the circuit of
Fig. 7.13.
Solution:
There are two ways we can solve this problem. One way is to obtain
the equivalent resistance at the inductor terminals and then use
Eq. (7.20). The other way is to start from scratch by using Kirchhoff’s
voltage law. Whichever approach is taken, it is always better to ﬁrst
obtain the inductor current.
■METHOD 1
The equivalent resistance is the same as the
Thevenin resistance at the inductor terminals. Because of the depend-
ent source, we insert a voltage source with 
at the inductor
terminals a-b, as in Fig. 7.14(a). (We could also insert a 1-A current
source at the terminals.) Applying KVL to the two loops results in
(7.3.1)
(7.3.2)
Substituting Eq. (7.3.2) into Eq. (7.3.1) gives

Assume that the switch was closed for a long time. It should be noted
that opening a switch in series with an ideal current source creates an
inﬁnite voltage at the current source terminals. Clearly this is impossi-
ble. For the purposes of problem solving, we can place a shunt resis-
tor in parallel with the source (which now makes it a voltage source
in series with a resistor). In more practical circuits, devices that act like
current sources are, for the most part, electronic circuits. These circuits
will allow the source to act like an ideal current source over its oper-
ating range but voltage-limit it when the load resistor becomes too large
(as in an open circuit).

Singularity Functions
Before going on with the second half of this chapter, we need to digress
and consider some mathematical concepts that will aid our under-
standing of transient analysis. A basic understanding of singularity
functions will help us make sense of the response of ﬁrst-order circuits
to a sudden application of an independent dc voltage or current source.
Singularity functions (also called switching functions) are very use-
ful in circuit analysis. They serve as good approximations to the
switching signals that arise in circuits with switching operations. They
are helpful in the neat, compact description of some circuit phenom-
ena, especially the step response of RC or RL circuits to be discussed
in the next sections. By deﬁnition,

Singularity functions are functions that either are discontinuous or have
discontinuous derivatives.

The unit step function u(t) is 0 for negative values of t and 1 for pos-
itive values of t.
The three most widely used singularity functions in circuit analy-
sis are the unit step, the unit impulse, and the unit ramp functions.

In mathematical terms,
(7.24)
The unit step function is undeﬁned at 
where it changes abruptly
from 0 to 1. It is dimensionless, like other mathematical functions such
as sine and cosine. Figure 7.23 depicts the unit step function. If the
abrupt change occurs at 
(where 
) instead of 
the unit
step function becomes
(7.25)
which is the same as saying that 
is delayed by 
seconds, as shown
in Fig. 7.24(a). To get Eq. (7.25) from Eq. (7.24), we simply replace
every t by 
If the change is at 
the unit step function
becomes
(7.26)
meaning that 
is advanced by 
seconds, as shown in Fig. 7.24(b).
We use the step function to represent an abrupt change in voltage
or current, like the changes that occur in the circuits of control systems
and digital computers. For example, the voltage
(7.27)
may be expressed in terms of the unit step function as

Impulsive currents and voltages occur in electric circuits as a result of
switching operations or impulsive sources. Although the unit impulse
function is not physically realizable (just like ideal sources, ideal
resistors, etc.), it is a very useful mathematical tool.
The unit impulse may be regarded as an applied or resulting shock.
It may be visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area. This
may be expressed mathematically as
(7.30)
where 
denotes the time just before 
and 
is the time
just after 
For this reason, it is customary to write 1 (denoting
unit area) beside the arrow that is used to symbolize the unit impulse
function, as in Fig. 7.27. The unit area is known as the strength of the
impulse function. When an impulse function has a strength other than
unity, the area of the impulse is equal to its strength. For example, an
impulse function 
has an area of 10. Figure 7.28 shows the
impulse functions 
and

The unit ramp function is zero for negative values of t and has a unit
slope for positive values of t.
Figure 7.29 shows the unit ramp function. In general, a ramp is a func-
tion that changes at a constant rate.
The unit ramp function may be delayed or advanced as shown in
Fig. 7.30. For the delayed unit ramp function,

and for the advanced unit ramp function,

Express the voltage pulse in Fig. 7.31 in terms of the unit step. Cal-
culate its derivative and sketch it.
Solution:
The type of pulse in Fig. 7.31 is called the gate function. It may be
regarded as a step function that switches on at one value of t and
switches off at another value of t. The gate function shown in Fig. 7.31
switches on at 
and switches off at 
It consists of the
sum of two unit step functions as shown in Fig. 7.32(a). From the
ﬁgure, it is evident that
Taking the derivative of this gives

Step Response of an RC Circuit
When the dc source of an RC circuit is suddenly applied, the voltage
or current source can be modeled as a step function, and the response
is known as a step response.
7.5
The step response of a circuit is its behavior when the excitation is the
step function, which may be a voltage or a current source.

The step response is the response of the circuit due to a sudden appli-
cation of a dc voltage or current source.
Consider the RC circuit in Fig. 7.40(a) which can be replaced by
the circuit in Fig. 7.40(b), where 
is a constant dc voltage source.
Again, we select the capacitor voltage as the circuit response to be
determined. We assume an initial voltage 
on the capacitor, although
this is not necessary for the step response. Since the voltage of a capac-
itor cannot change instantaneously,

is its voltage immediately after switching. Applying KCL, we have

This is known as the complete response (or total response) of the RC
circuit to a sudden application of a dc voltage source, assuming the
capacitor is initially charged. The reason for the term “complete” will
become evident a little later. Assuming that 
a plot of

shown in Fig. 7.41.
If we assume that the capacitor is uncharged initially, we set
in Eq. (7.46) so that

(7.48)
This is the complete step response of the RC circuit when the capaci-
tor is initially uncharged. The current through the capacitor is obtained
from Eq. (7.47) using 
We get

Figure 7.42 shows the plots of capacitor voltage 
and capacitor cur-
rent 
Rather than going through the derivations above, there is a sys-
tematic approach—or rather, a short-cut method—for ﬁnding the step
response of an RC or RL circuit. Let us reexamine Eq. (7.45), which is
more general than Eq. (7.48). It is evident that 
has two components.
Classically there are two ways of decomposing this into two compo-
nents. The ﬁrst is to break it into a “natural response and a forced
response’’ and the second is to break it into a “transient response and
a steady-state response.’’ Starting with the natural response and forced
response, we write the total or complete response as
or
(7.50)
where
and
We are familiar with the natural response 
of the circuit, as discussed
in Section 7.2. 
is known as the forced response because it is pro-
duced by the circuit when an external “force’’ (a voltage source in this
case) is applied. It represents what the circuit is forced to do by the
input excitation. The natural response eventually dies out along with
the transient component of the forced response, leaving only the steady-
state component of the forced response.

Another way of looking at the complete response is to break into

where

(7.52b)
The transient response
is temporary; it is the portion of the com-

First-Order Circuits
The transient response is the circuit’s temporary response that will die
out with time.
The steady-state response
is the portion of the complete response
that remains after the transient reponse has died out. Thus,
vss
The ﬁrst decomposition of the complete response is in terms of the
source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of
the permanency of the responses. Under certain conditions, the natural
response and transient response are the same. The same can be said
about the forced response and steady-state response.
Whichever way we look at it, the complete response in Eq. (7.45)
may be written as
(7.53)
where 
is the initial voltage at 
and 
is the ﬁnal or steady-
state value. Thus, to ﬁnd the step response of an RC circuit requires
three things:

Step Response of an RL Circuit
Consider the RL circuit in Fig. 7.48(a), which may be replaced by the
circuit in Fig. 7.48(b). Again, our goal is to ﬁnd the inductor current i
as the circuit response. Rather than apply Kirchhoff’s laws, we will use
the simple technique in Eqs. (7.50) through (7.53). Let the response be
the sum of the transient response and the steady-state response,
(7.55)
We know that the transient response is always a decaying exponential,
that is,
(7.56)
where A is a constant to be determined.
The steady-state response is the value of the current a long time after
the switch in Fig. 7.48(a) is closed. We know that the transient response
essentially dies out after ﬁve time constants. At that time, the inductor
becomes a short circuit, and the voltage across it is zero. The entire
source voltage 
appears across R. Thus, the steady-state response is
(7.57)
Substituting Eqs. (7.56) and (7.57) into Eq. (7.55) gives
(7.58)
We now determine the constant A from the initial value of i. Let 
be
the initial current through the inductor, which may come from a source
other than 
Since the current through the inductor cannot change
instantaneously,
(7.59)
Thus, at 
Eq. (7.58) becomes
From this, we obtain A as 
Substituting for A in Eq. (7.58), we get
(7.60)
This is the complete response of the RL circuit. It is illustrated in
Fig. 7.49. The response in Eq. (7.60) may be written as

First-Order Op Amp Circuits
An op amp circuit containing a storage element will exhibit ﬁrst-order
behavior. Differentiators and integrators treated in Section 6.6 are
examples of ﬁrst-order op amp circuits. Again, for practical reasons,
inductors are hardly ever used in op amp circuits; therefore, the op amp
circuits we consider here are of the RC type.
As usual, we analyze op amp circuits using nodal analysis. Some-
times, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is used to reduce the op amp cir-
cuit to one that we can easily handle. The following three examples
illustrate the concepts. The ﬁrst one deals with a source-free op amp
circuit, while the other two involve step responses. The three examples
have been carefully selected to cover all possible RC types of op amp
circuits, depending on the location of the capacitor with respect to the
op amp; that is, the capacitor can be located in the input, the output,
or the feedback loop.

Solution:

Consider the circuit in Fig. 7.55(a). Let us derive the
appropriate differential equation using nodal analysis. If 
is the volt-
age at node 1, at that node, KCL gives
(7.14.1)
Since nodes 2 and 3 must be at the same potential, the potential at node
2 is zero. Thus, 
or 
and Eq. (7.14.1) becomes
(7.14.2)
This is similar to Eq. (7.4b) so that the solution is obtained the same
way as in Section 7.2, i.e.,
(7.14.3)
where 
is the initial voltage across the capacitor. But 
and 
Hence,
(7.14.4)
Applying KCL at node 2 gives

Notice that this applies strictly to the capacitor

the op amp, the elements on the feedback loop of the op amp constitute
an RC circuit, with

For 
the switch is open and there is no voltage across the

For 
we obtain the voltage at node

Since there is no storage element in the input loop,

for all t. At steady state, the capacitor acts like an open circuit so that
the op amp circuit is a noninverting ampliﬁer. Thus,

Transient Analysis with PSpice
As we discussed in Section 7.5, the transient response is the temporary
response of the circuit that soon disappears. PSpice can be used to
obtain the transient response of a circuit with storage elements. Sec-
tion D.4 in Appendix D provides a review of transient analysis using
PSpice for Windows. It is recommended that you read Section D.4
before continuing with this section.
If necessary, dc PSpice analysis is ﬁrst carried out to determine the
initial conditions. Then the initial conditions are used in the transient
PSpice analysis to obtain the transient responses. It is recommended
but not necessary that during this dc analysis, all capacitors should be
open-circuited while all inductors should be short-circuited.

We recall from Appendix D that the part name for a closed switch is
Sw_tclose. We do not need to specify the initial condition of the
inductor because PSpice will determine that from the circuit. By
selecting Analysis/Setup/Transient, we set Print Step to 25 ms and
Final Step to 
After saving the circuit, we simulate by
selecting Analysis/Simulate. In the PSpice A/D window, we select
Trace/Add and display –I(L1) as the current through the inductor.

Note that the negative sign on I(L1) is needed because the current
enters through the upper terminal of the inductor, which happens to be
the negative terminal after one counterclockwise rotation. A way to avoid
the negative sign is to ensure that current enters pin 1 of the inductor.
To obtain this desired direction of positive current ﬂow, the initially
horizontal inductor symbol should be rotated counterclockwise 
and placed in the desired location.

circuit voltage (with the capacitor removed) is equal to the
voltage drop across the

circuit is in Fig. 7.68(a). Two pseudocomponent VIEWPOINTs are
inserted to measure the voltages at nodes 1 and 2. When the circuit
is simulated, we obtain the displayed values in Fig. 7.68(a) as

Applications
The various devices in which RC and RL circuits ﬁnd applications
include ﬁltering in dc power supplies, smoothing circuits in digital com-
munications, differentiators, integrators, delay circuits, and relay circuits.
Some of these applications take advantage of the short or long time con-
stants of the RC or RL circuits. We will consider four simple applica-
tions here. The ﬁrst two are RC circuits, the last two are RL circuits.
7.9.1
Delay Circuits
An RC circuit can be used to provide various time delays. Figure 7.73
shows such a circuit. It basically consists of an RC circuit with the capac-
itor connected in parallel with a neon lamp. The voltage source can pro-
vide enough voltage to ﬁre the lamp. When the switch is closed, the
capacitor voltage increases gradually toward 110 V at a rate determined
by the circuit’s time constant, 
The lamp will act as an open

level, say 70 V. When the voltage level is reached, the lamp ﬁres (goes
on), and the capacitor discharges through it. Due to the low resistance
of the lamp when on, the capacitor voltage drops fast and the lamp turns
off. The lamp acts again as an open circuit and the capacitor recharges.
By adjusting 
we can introduce either short or long time delays into
the circuit and make the lamp ﬁre, recharge, and ﬁre repeatedly every
time constant

to get
the capacitor voltage high enough to ﬁre or low enough to turn off.
The warning blinkers commonly found on road construction sites

Photoﬂash Unit
An electronic ﬂash unit provides a common example of an RC circuit.
This application exploits the ability of the capacitor to oppose any
abrupt change in voltage. Figure 7.75 shows a simpliﬁed circuit. It con-
sists essentially of a high-voltage dc supply, a current-limiting large
resistor 
and a capacitor C in parallel with the ﬂashlamp of low
resistance 
When the switch is in position 1, the capacitor charges
slowly due to the large time constant (
). As shown in
Fig. 7.76(a), the capacitor voltage rises gradually from zero to 
while
its current decreases gradually from 
to zero. The charging
time is approximately ﬁve times the time constant,
(7.65)
With the switch in position 2, the capacitor voltage is discharged.
The low resistance 
of the photolamp permits a high discharge
current with peak 
in a short duration, as depicted in
Fig. 7.76(b). Discharging takes place in approximately ﬁve times the
time constant,

The coil circuit is an RL circuit like that in Fig. 7.77(b), where R and
L are the resistance and inductance of the coil. When switch 
in
Fig. 7.77(a) is closed, the coil circuit is energized. The coil current
gradually increases and produces a magnetic ﬁeld. Eventually the mag-
netic ﬁeld is sufﬁciently strong to pull the movable contact in the other
circuit and close switch 
At this point, the relay is said to be pulled
in. The time interval 
between the closure of switches 
and 
is
called the relay delay time.
Relays were used in the earliest digital circuits and are still used
for switching high-power circuits.

7.9.4
Automobile Ignition Circuit
The ability of inductors to oppose rapid change in current makes them
useful for arc or spark generation. An automobile ignition system takes
advantage of this feature.
The gasoline engine of an automobile requires that the fuel-air
mixture in each cylinder be ignited at proper times. This is achieved
by means of a spark plug (Fig. 7.78), which essentially consists of a
pair of electrodes separated by an air gap. By creating a large voltage
(thousands of volts) between the electrodes, a spark is formed across
the air gap, thereby igniting the fuel. But how can such a large volt-
age be obtained from the car battery, which supplies only 12 V? This
is achieved by means of an inductor (the spark coil) L. Since the volt-
age across the inductor is 
we can make 
large by cre-
ating a large change in current in a very short time. When the ignition
switch in Fig. 7.78 is closed, the current through the inductor increases
gradually and reaches the ﬁnal value of 
where 
Again, the time taken for the inductor to charge is ﬁve times the time
constant of the circuit 
(7.67)
Since at steady state, i is constant, 
and the inductor voltage
When the switch suddenly opens, a large voltage is developed
across the inductor (due to the rapidly collapsing ﬁeld) causing a spark
or arc in the air gap. The spark continues until the energy stored in the
inductor is dissipated in the spark discharge. In laboratories, when one
is working with inductive circuits, this same effect causes a very nasty
shock, and one must exercise caution.

Summary
1. The analysis in this chapter is applicable to any circuit that can be
reduced to an equivalent circuit comprising a resistor and a single
energy-storage element (inductor or capacitor). Such a circuit is
ﬁrst-order because its behavior is described by a ﬁrst-order differ-
ential equation. When analyzing RC and RL circuits, one must
always keep in mind that the capacitor is an open circuit to steady-
state dc conditions while the inductor is a short circuit to steady-
state dc conditions.
2. The natural response is obtained when no independent source is
present. It has the general form
where x represents current through (or voltage across) a resistor, a
capacitor, or an inductor, and
is the initial value of x. Because
most practical resistors, capacitors, and inductors always have losses,
the natural response is a transient response, i.e. it dies out with time.
3. The time constant 
is the time required for a response to decay
to 
of its initial value. For RC circuits,

cuits, t  LR.

that a 
capacitor was needed for a time
constant of 3 ms. What value resistor is necessary for
the circuit?
7.83 An RC circuit consists of a series connection of a
120-V source, a switch, a 
resistor, and a
capacitor. The circuit is used in estimating the
speed of a horse running a 4-km racetrack. The
switch closes when the horse begins and opens when
the horse crosses the ﬁnish line. Assuming that the
capacitor charges to 85.6 V, calculate the speed of
the horse.

Everyone who can earn a masters degree in engineering must earn a
masters degree in engineering in order to maximize the success of their

Enhancing Your Career
To increase your engineering career opportunities after graduation,
develop a strong fundamental understanding in a broad set of engineer-
ing areas. When possible, this might best be accomplished by working
toward a graduate degree immediately upon receiving your undergradu-
ate degree.
Each degree in engineering represents certain skills the student
acquires. At the Bachelor degree level, you learn the language of engi-
neering and the fundamentals of engineering and design. At the Mas-
ter’s level, you acquire the ability to do advanced engineering projects
and to communicate your work effectively both orally and in writing.
The Ph.D. represents a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of
electrical engineering and a mastery of the skills necessary both for
working at the frontiers of an engineering area and for communicating
one’s effort to others.
If you have no idea what career you should pursue after gradua-
tion, a graduate degree program will enhance your ability to explore
career options. Since your undergraduate degree will only provide you
with the fundamentals of engineering, a Master’s degree in engineer-
ing supplemented by business courses beneﬁts more engineering stu-
dents than does getting a Master’s of Business Administration (MBA).
The best time to get your MBA is after you have been a practicing
engineer for some years and decide your career path would be
enhanced by strengthening your business skills.
Engineers should constantly educate themselves, formally and
informally, taking advantage of all means of education. Perhaps there
is no better way to enhance your career than to join a professional soci-
ety such as IEEE and be an active member.
Enhancing your career involves under-
standing your goals, adapting to changes,
anticipating opportunities, and planning
your own niche.

Second-Order Circuits
A second-order circuit is characterized by a second-order differen-
tial equation. It consists of resistors and the equivalent of two energy
storage elements.
Our analysis of second-order circuits will be similar to that used for
ﬁrst-order. We will ﬁrst consider circuits that are excited by the ini-
tial conditions of the storage elements. Although these circuits may
contain dependent sources, they are free of independent sources.
These source-free circuits will give natural responses as expected.
Later we will consider circuits that are excited by independent
sources. These circuits will give both the transient response and the
steady-state response. We consider only dc independent sources in
this chapter. The case of sinusoidal and exponential sources is deferred
to later chapters.
We begin by learning how to obtain the initial conditions for the
circuit variables and their derivatives, as this is crucial to analyzing
second-order circuits. Then we consider series and parallel RLC cir-
cuits such as shown in Fig. 8.1 for the two cases of excitation: by
initial conditions of the energy storage elements and by step inputs.
Later we examine other types of second-order circuits, including op
amp circuits. We will consider PSpice analysis of second-order cir-
cuits. Finally, we will consider the automobile ignition system and
smoothing circuits as typical applications of the circuits treated in this
chapter. Other applications such as resonant circuits and ﬁlters will
be covered in Chapter 14.
Finding Initial and Final Values
Perhaps the major problem students face in handling second-order cir-
cuits is ﬁnding the initial and ﬁnal conditions on circuit variables.
Students are usually comfortable getting the initial and ﬁnal values
of v and i but often have difﬁculty ﬁnding the initial values of their

Introduction
In the previous chapter we considered circuits with a single storage ele-
ment (a capacitor or an inductor). Such circuits are ﬁrst-order because
the differential equations describing them are ﬁrst-order. In this chap-
ter we will consider circuits containing two storage elements. These are
known as second-order circuits because their responses are described
by differential equations that contain second derivatives.
Typical examples of second-order circuits are RLC circuits, in
which the three kinds of passive elements are present. Examples of
such circuits are shown in Fig. 8.1(a) and (b). Other examples are RL
and RC circuits, as shown in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d). It is apparent from
Fig. 8.1 that a second-order circuit may have two storage elements of
different type or the same type (provided elements of the same type
cannot be represented by an equivalent single element). An op amp cir-
cuit with two storage elements may also be a second-order circuit. As
with ﬁrst-order circuits, a second-order circuit may contain several
resistors and dependent and independent sources.

devoted to the subtleties of getting

and 
Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, v denotes capacitor
voltage, while i is the inductor current.
There are two key points to keep in mind in determining the ini-
tial conditions.
First—as always in circuit analysis—we must carefully handle the
polarity of voltage 
across the capacitor and the direction of the cur-
rent 
through the inductor. Keep in mind that v and i are deﬁned
strictly according to the passive sign convention (see Figs. 6.3 and 6.23).
One should carefully observe how these are deﬁned and apply them
accordingly.
Second, keep in mind that the capacitor voltage is always contin-
uous so that

and the inductor current is always continuous so that

where 
denotes the time just before a switching event and
is the time just after the switching event, assuming that the
switching event takes place at

Thus, in ﬁnding initial conditions, we ﬁrst focus on those vari-
ables that cannot change abruptly, capacitor voltage and inductor cur-
rent, by applying Eq. (8.1). The following examples illustrate these
ideas.

The Source-Free Series RLC Circuit
An understanding of the natural response of the series RLC circuit is
a necessary background for future studies in ﬁlter design and commu-
nications networks.
Consider the series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 8.8. The circuit is
being excited by the energy initially stored in the capacitor and induc-
tor. The energy is represented by the initial capacitor voltage 
and
initial inductor current 
. Thus, at

To eliminate the integral, we differentiate with respect to t and
rearrange terms. We get
(8.4)
This is a second-order differential equation and is the reason for call-
ing the RLC circuits in this chapter second-order circuits. Our goal is
to solve Eq. (8.4). To solve such a second-order differential equation
requires that we have two initial conditions, such as the initial value
of i and its ﬁrst derivative or initial values of some i and 
The ini-
tial value of i is given in Eq. (8.2b). We get the initial value of the
derivative of i from Eqs. (8.2a) and (8.3); that is,
or
(8.5)
With the two initial conditions in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5), we can now
solve Eq. (8.4). Our experience in the preceding chapter on ﬁrst-order
circuits suggests that the solution is of exponential form. So we let
(8.6)
where A and s are constants to be determined. Substituting Eq. (8.6)
into Eq. (8.4) and carrying out the necessary differentiations, we obtain

(8.7)
Since 
is the assumed solution we are trying to ﬁnd, only the
expression in parentheses can be zero:
(8.8)
This quadratic equation is known as the characteristic equation of the
differential Eq. (8.4), since the roots of the equation dictate the char-
acter of i. The two roots of Eq. (8.8) are

strictly as the undamped natural frequency, expressed in radians per

written as
(8.8a)
The variables s and 
are important quantities we will be discussing
throughout the rest of the text.
The two values of s in Eq. (8.10) indicate that there are two pos-
sible solutions for i, each of which is of the form of the assumed solu-
tion in Eq. (8.6); that is,
(8.12)
Since Eq. (8.4) is a linear equation, any linear combination of the
two distinct solutions 
and 
is also a solution of Eq. (8.4). A com-
plete or total solution of Eq. (8.4) would therefore require a linear
combination of 
and . Thus, the natural response of the series RLC
circuit is
(8.13)
where the constants 
and 
are determined from the initial values
and 
in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5).
From Eq. (8.10), we can infer that there are three types of solutions:
1. If 
we have the overdamped case.
2. If 
we have the critically damped case.
3. If 
we have the underdamped case.
We will consider each of these cases separately.

The response is overdamped when
the roots of the circuit’s characteristic
equation are unequal and real, critically
damped when the roots are equal and
real, and underdamped when the
roots are complex.

For this case, Eq. (8.13) yields
where 
. This cannot be the solution, because the two ini-
tial conditions cannot be satisﬁed with the single constant 
. What
then could be wrong? Our assumption of an exponential solution is
incorrect for the special case of critical damping. Let us go back to
Eq. (8.4). When 
, Eq. (8.4) becomes
or
(8.16)
If we let
(8.17)
then Eq. (8.16) becomes
which is a ﬁrst-order differential equation with solution 
where 
is a constant. Equation (8.17) then becomes
or
(8.18)
This can be written as
(8.19)
Integrating both sides yields
or
(8.20)
where 
is another constant. Hence, the natural response of the criti-
cally damped circuit is a sum of two terms: a negative exponential and
a negative exponential multiplied by a linear term, or

A typical critically damped response is shown in Fig. 8.9(b). In fact,

nature. The response has a time constant of

Once the inductor current 
is found for the RLC series circuit
as shown above, other circuit quantities such as individual element
voltages can easily be found. For example, the resistor voltage is
and the inductor voltage is 
. The inductor cur-
rent 
is selected as the key variable to be determined ﬁrst in order
to take advantage of Eq. (8.1b).
We conclude this section by noting the following interesting, pecu-
liar properties of an RLC network:
1. The behavior of such a network is captured by the idea of damping,
which is the gradual loss of the initial stored energy, as evidenced by
the continuous decrease in the amplitude of the response. The damp-
ing effect is due to the presence of resistance R. The damping factor
determines the rate at which the response is damped. If 
then 
and we have an LC circuit with 
as the
undamped natural frequency. Since 
in this case, the response
is not only undamped but also oscillatory. The circuit is said to be
loss-less, because the dissipating or damping element (R) is absent.
By adjusting the value of R, the response may be made undamped,
overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped.
2. Oscillatory response is possible due to the presence of the two
types of storage elements. Having both L and C allows the ﬂow of

R
0 produces a perfectly sinusoidal
response. This response cannot be
practically accomplished with L and C
because of the inherent losses in them.
See Figs 6.8 and 6.26. An electronic
device called an oscillator can pro-
duce a perfectly sinusoidal response.

Examples 8.5 and 8.7 demonstrate the
effect of varying R.
The response of a second-order circuit
with two storage elements of the same
type, as in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d), cannot
be oscillatory.

energy back and forth between the two. The damped oscillation
exhibited by the underdamped response is known as ringing. It
stems from the ability of the storage elements L and C to transfer
energy back and forth between them.
3. Observe from Fig. 8.9 that the waveforms of the responses differ.
In general, it is difﬁcult to tell from the waveforms the difference
between the overdamped and critically damped responses. The crit-
ically damped case is the borderline between the underdamped and
overdamped cases and it decays the fastest. With the same initial
conditions, the overdamped case has the longest settling time,
because it
takes the longest time to dissipate the initial stored
energy. If we desire the response that approaches the ﬁnal value
most rapidly without oscillation or ringing, the critically damped
circuit is the right choice.

cuits is  that we seek an overdamped
circuit that is as close as possible to a
critically damped circuit.

Since the three elements are in parallel, they have the same voltage v
across them. According to passive sign convention, the current is enter-
ing each element; that is, the current through each element is leaving
the top node. Thus, applying KCL at the top node gives

Step voltage applied to a series RLC circuit.

Substituting for i in Eq. (8.39) and rearranging terms,
(8.40)
which has the same form as Eq. (8.4). More speciﬁcally, the coefﬁ-
cients are the same (and that is important in determining the frequency
parameters) but the variable is different. (Likewise, see Eq. (8.47).)
Hence, the characteristic equation for the series RLC circuit is not
affected by the presence of the dc source.
The solution to Eq. (8.40) has two components: the transient
response 
and the steady-state response 
that is,
(8.41)
The transient response 
is the component of the total response that
dies out with time. The form of the transient response is the same as the
form of the solution obtained in Section 8.3 for the source-free circuit,
given by Eqs. (8.14), (8.21), and (8.26). Therefore, the transient response
for the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are:
(8.42a)
(8.42b)
(8.42c)
The steady-state response is the ﬁnal value of 
. In the circuit in
Fig. 8.18, the ﬁnal value of the capacitor voltage is the same as the
source voltage 
. Hence,
(8.43)
Thus, the complete solutions for the overdamped, underdamped, and
critically damped cases are:
(8.44a)
(8.44b)
(8.44c)
The values of the constants 
and 
are obtained from the initial con-
ditions: 
and 
Keep in mind that v and i are, respectively,
the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the inductor.
Therefore, Eq. (8.44) only applies for ﬁnding v. But once the capaci-
tor voltage 
is known, we can determine 
which is
the same current through the capacitor, inductor, and resistor. Hence,
the voltage across the resistor is 
while the inductor voltage is
Alternatively, the complete response for any variable 
can be
found directly, because it has the general form
(8.45)
where the 
is the ﬁnal value and 
is the transient response.
The ﬁnal value is found as in Section 8.2. The transient response has
the same form as in Eq. (8.42), and the associated constants are deter-
mined from Eq. (8.44) based on the values of

Second-Order Circuits

General Second-Order Circuits
Now that we have mastered series and parallel RLC circuits, we are
prepared to apply the ideas to any second-order circuit having one or
more independent sources with constant values. Although the series and
parallel RLC circuits are the second-order circuits of greatest interest,
other second-order circuits including op amps are also useful. Given a
second-order circuit, we determine its step response 
(which may
be voltage or current) by taking the following four steps:
1. We ﬁrst determine the initial conditions 
and 
and the
ﬁnal value 
as discussed in Section 8.2.
2. We turn off the independent sources and ﬁnd the form of the tran-
sient response 
by applying KCL and KVL. Once a second-order
differential equation is obtained, we determine its characteristic
roots. Depending on whether the response is overdamped, critically
damped, or underdamped, we obtain 
with two unknown con-
stants as we did in the previous sections.
3. We obtain the steady-state response as
(8.51)
where 
is the ﬁnal value of x, obtained in step 1.
4. The total response is now found as the sum of the transient
response and steady-state response
(8.52)
We ﬁnally determine the constants associated with the transient
response by imposing the initial conditions 
and 
determined in step 1.
We can apply this general procedure to ﬁnd the step response of
any second-order circuit, including those with op amps. The following
examples illustrate the four steps.

For Practice Prob. 8.8.
A circuit may look complicated at ﬁrst.
But once the sources are turned off in
an attempt to ﬁnd the form of the tran-
sient response, it may be reducible to
a ﬁrst-order circuit, when the storage
elements can be combined, or to a
parallel/series RLC circuit. If it is re-
ducible to a ﬁrst-order circuit, the solu-
tion becomes simply what we had in
Chapter 7. If it is reducible to a parallel
or series RLC circuit, we apply the tech-
niques of previous sections in this
chapter.
Problems in this chapter can also be
solved by using Laplace transforms,
which are covered in Chapters 15
and 16.

Second-Order Op Amp Circuits
An op amp circuit with two storage elements that cannot be combined
into a single equivalent element is second-order. Because inductors are
bulky and heavy, they are rarely used in practical op amp circuits. For
this reason, we will only consider RC second-order op amp circuits
here. Such circuits ﬁnd a wide range of applications in devices such as
ﬁlters and oscillators.
The analysis of a second-order op amp circuit follows the same
four steps given and demonstrated in the previous section.

PSpice Analysis of RLC Circuits
RLC circuits can be analyzed with great ease using PSpice, just like
the RC or RL circuits of Chapter 7. The following two examples will
illustrate this. The reader may review Section D.4 in Appendix D on
PSpice for transient analysis.

The input voltage in Fig. 8.35(a) is applied to the circuit in Fig. 8.35(b).
Use PSpice to plot 
for 
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. As true with most textbook problems, the problem is
clearly deﬁned.
2. Present. The input is equal to a single square wave of
amplitude 12 V with a period of 2 s. We are asked to plot the
output, using PSpice.
3. Alternative. Since we are required to use PSpice, that is the
only alternative for a solution. However, we can check it using
the technique illustrated in Section 8.5 (a step response for a
series RLC circuit).
4. Attempt. The given circuit is drawn using Schematics as in
Fig. 8.36. The pulse is speciﬁed using VPWL voltage source,
but VPULSE could be used instead. Using the piecewise linear
function, we set the attributes of VPWL as 
and so forth, as shown in Fig. 8.36.
Two voltage markers are inserted to plot the input and output
voltages. Once the circuit is drawn and the attributes are set,
we select Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient
Analysis dialog box. As a parallel RLC circuit, the roots of the
characteristic equation are 
and 
Thus, we may set Final
Time as 4 s (four times the magnitude of the lower root). When

enters pin 1, the inductor is rotated three times before it is placed in
the circuit. The same applies for the capacitor. We insert pseudo-
components VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to determine the initial capacitor
voltage and initial inductor current. We carry out a dc PSpice analysis

Duality
The concept of duality is a time-saving, effort-effective measure of
solving circuit problems. Consider the similarity between Eq. (8.4) and
Eq. (8.29). The two equations are the same, except that we must inter-
change the following quantities: (1) voltage and current, (2) resistance
and conductance, (3) capacitance and inductance. Thus, it sometimes
occurs in circuit analysis that two different circuits have the same equa-
tions and solutions, except that the roles of certain complementary ele-
ments are interchanged. This interchangeability is known as the
principle of duality.
8.10
350
Chapter 8
Second-Order Circuits
The duality principle asserts a parallelism between pairs of characteriz-
ing equations and theorems of electric circuits.
Dual pairs are shown in Table 8.1. Note that power does not appear in
Table 8.1, because power has no dual. The reason for this is the prin-
ciple of linearity; since power is not linear, duality does not apply. Also
notice from Table 8.1 that the principle of duality extends to circuit
elements, conﬁgurations, and theorems.
Two circuits that are described by equations of the same form, but
in which the variables are interchanged, are said to be dual to each other.
Two circuits are said to be duals of one another if they are described
by the same characterizing equations with dual quantities interchanged.
The usefulness of the duality principle is self-evident. Once we
know the solution to one circuit, we automatically have the solution
for the dual circuit. It is obvious that the circuits in Figs. 8.8 and 8.13
are dual. Consequently, the result in Eq. (8.32) is the dual of that in
Eq. (8.11). We must keep in mind that the method described here for
ﬁnding a dual is limited to planar circuits. Finding a dual for a non-
planar circuit is beyond the scope of this textbook because nonplanar
circuits cannot be described by a system of mesh equations.
To ﬁnd the dual of a given circuit, we do not need to write down
the mesh or node equations. We can use a graphical technique. Given
a planar circuit, we construct the dual circuit by taking the following
three steps:
1. Place a node at the center of each mesh of the given circuit. Place
the reference node (the ground) of the dual circuit outside the
given circuit.
2. Draw lines between the nodes such that each line crosses an ele-
ment. Replace that element by its dual (see Table 8.1).
3. To determine the polarity of voltage sources and direction of cur-
rent sources, follow this rule: A voltage source that produces a pos-
itive (clockwise) mesh current has as its dual a current source whose
reference direction is from the ground to the nonreference node.
In case of doubt, one may verify the dual circuit by writing the nodal
or mesh equations. The mesh (or nodal) equations of the original circuit
are similar to the nodal (or mesh) equations of the dual circuit. The
duality principle is illustrated with the following two examples.

Even when the principle of linearity

may not have a dual.  For example,
mutual inductance (to be covered in
Chapter 13) has no dual.

Duality
351
Construct the dual of the circuit in Fig. 8.44.
Solution:
As shown in Fig. 8.45(a), we ﬁrst locate nodes 1 and 2 in the two
meshes and also the ground node 0 for the dual circuit. We draw a line
between one node and another crossing an element. We replace the line
joining the nodes by the duals of the elements which it crosses. For
example, a line between nodes 1 and 2 crosses a 2-H inductor, and we
place a 2-F capacitor (an inductor’s dual) on the line. A line between
nodes 1 and 0 crossing the 6-V voltage source will contain a 6-A
current source. By drawing lines crossing all the elements, we construct
the dual circuit on the given circuit as in Fig. 8.45(a). The dual circuit
is redrawn in Fig. 8.45(b) for clarity.

Applications
Practical applications of RLC circuits are found in control and com-
munications circuits such as ringing circuits, peaking circuits, resonant
circuits, smoothing circuits, and ﬁlters. Most of these circuits cannot
be covered until we treat ac sources. For now, we will limit ourselves
to two simple applications: automobile ignition and smoothing circuits.
8.11.1
Automobile Ignition System
In Section 7.9.4, we considered the automobile ignition system as a
charging system. That was only a part of the system. Here, we con-
sider another part—the voltage generating system. The system is mod-
eled by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.52. The 12-V source is due to the
battery and alternator. The 
resistor represents the resistance of the
wiring. The ignition coil is modeled by the 8-mH inductor. The 
capacitor (known as the condenser to automechanics) is in parallel with
the switch (known as the breaking points or electronic ignition). In the
following example, we determine how the RLC circuit in Fig. 8.52 is
used in generating high voltage.

Smoothing Circuits
In a typical digital communication system, the signal to be transmitted
is ﬁrst sampled. Sampling refers to the procedure of selecting samples
of a signal for processing, as opposed to processing the entire signal.
Each sample is converted into a binary number represented by a series
of pulses. The pulses are transmitted by a transmission line such as a
coaxial cable, twisted pair, or optical ﬁber. At the receiving end, the
signal is applied to a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter whose output is
a “staircase” function, that is, constant at each time interval. In order
to recover the transmitted analog signal, the output is smoothed by let-
ting it pass through a “smoothing” circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 8.53.
An RLC circuit may be used as the smoothing circuit.

Summary
1. The determination of the initial values 
and 
and ﬁnal
value 
is crucial to analyzing second-order circuits.
2. The RLC circuit is second-order because it is described by a
second-order differential equation. Its characteristic equation is

where 
is the damping factor and

undamped natural frequency. For a series circuit, 
for a
parallel circuit 
and for both cases 
3. If there are no independent sources in the circuit after switching
(or sudden change), we regard the circuit as source-free. The com-
plete solution is the natural response.
4. The natural response of an RLC circuit is overdamped, under-
damped, or critically damped, depending on the roots of the char-
acteristic equation. The response is critically damped when the
roots are equal (
or 
), overdamped when the roots
are real and unequal (
or 
), or underdamped when
the roots are complex conjugate (
or 
).
5. If independent sources are present in the circuit after switching,
the complete response is the sum of the transient response and the
steady-state response.
6. PSpice is used to analyze RLC circuits in the same way as for RC
or RL circuits.
7. Two circuits are dual if the mesh equations that describe one circuit
have the same form as the nodal equations that describe the other.
The analysis of one circuit gives the analysis of its dual circuit.
8. The automobile ignition circuit and the smoothing circuit are typ-
ical applications of the material covered in this chapter.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.d), “an ability to function on
multi-disciplinary teams.”
The “ability to function on multidisciplinary teams” is inherently crit-
ical for the working engineer. Engineers rarely, if ever, work by them-
selves. Engineers will always be part of some team. One of the things
I like to remind students is that you do not have to like everyone on a
team; you just have to be a successful part of that team.
Most frequently, these teams include individuals from a variety of
engineering disciplines, as well as individuals from nonengineering dis-
ciplines such as marketing and ﬁnance.
Students can easily develop and enhance this skill by working in
study groups in every course they take. Clearly, working in study
groups in nonengineering courses, as well as engineering courses out-
side your discipline, will also give you experience with multidiscipli-
nary teams.

Introduction
Thus far our analysis has been limited for the most part to dc circuits:
those circuits excited by constant or time-invariant sources. We have
restricted the forcing function to dc sources for the sake of simplicity,
for pedagogic reasons, and also for historic reasons. Historically, dc
sources were the main means of providing electric power up until the
late 1800s. At the end of that century, the battle of direct current ver-
sus alternating current began. Both had their advocates among the elec-
trical engineers of the time. Because ac is more efﬁcient and economical
to transmit over long distances, ac systems ended up the winner. Thus,
it is in keeping with the historical sequence of events that we consid-
ered dc sources ﬁrst.
We now begin the analysis of circuits in which the source voltage or
current is time-varying. In this chapter, we are particularly interested in
sinusoidally time-varying excitation, or simply, excitation by a sinusoid.
9.1

Chapter 9
Sinusoids and Phasors
Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) and George Westinghouse (1846–1914)
helped establish alternating current as the primary mode of electricity
transmission and distribution.
Today it is obvious that ac generation is well established as the form
of electric power that makes widespread distribution of electric power
efﬁcient and economical. However, at the end of the 19th century, which
was the better—ac or dc—was hotly debated and had extremely out-
spoken supporters on both sides. The dc side was led by Thomas Edison,
who had earned a lot of respect for his many contributions. Power gen-
eration using ac really began to build after the successful contributions
of Tesla. The real commercial success in ac came from George
Westinghouse and the outstanding team, including Tesla, he assembled.
In addition, two other big names were C. F. Scott and B. G. Lamme.
The most signiﬁcant contribution to the early success of ac was
the patenting of the polyphase ac motor by Tesla in 1888. The induc-
tion motor and polyphase generation and distribution systems doomed
the use of dc as the prime energy source.
Historical
A sinusoid is a signal that has the form of the sine or cosine function.
A sinusoidal current is usually referred to as alternating current (ac).
Such a current reverses at regular time intervals and has alternately pos-
itive and negative values. Circuits driven by sinusoidal current or volt-
age sources are called ac circuits.
We are interested in sinusoids for a number of reasons. First, nature
itself is characteristically sinusoidal. We experience sinusoidal varia-
tion in the motion of a pendulum, the vibration of a string, the ripples
on the ocean surface, and the natural response of underdamped second-
order systems, to mention but a few. Second, a sinusoidal signal is easy
to generate and transmit. It is the form of voltage generated throughout

the world and supplied to homes, factories, laboratories, and so on. It
is the dominant form of signal in the communications and electric
power industries. Third, through Fourier analysis, any practical peri-
odic signal can be represented by a sum of sinusoids. Sinusoids,
therefore, play an important role in the analysis of periodic signals.
Lastly, a sinusoid is easy to handle mathematically. The derivative
and integral of a sinusoid are themselves sinusoids. For these and
other reasons, the sinusoid is an extremely important function in
circuit analysis.
A sinusoidal forcing function produces both a transient response
and a steady-state response, much like the step function, which we stud-
ied in Chapters 7 and 8. The transient response dies out with time so
that only the steady-state response remains. When the transient response
has become negligibly small compared with the steady-state response,
we say that the circuit is operating at sinusoidal steady state. It is this
sinusoidal steady-state response that is of main interest to us in this
chapter.
We begin with a basic discussion of sinusoids and phasors. We
then introduce the concepts of impedance and admittance. The basic
circuit laws, Kirchhoff’s and Ohm’s, introduced for dc circuits, will be
applied to ac circuits. Finally, we consider applications of ac circuits
in phase-shifters and bridges.
Sinusoids
Consider the sinusoidal voltage
(9.1)
where
The sinusoid is shown in Fig. 9.1(a) as a function of its argument and
in Fig. 9.1(b) as a function of time. It is evident that the sinusoid
repeats itself every T seconds; thus, T is called the period of the sinu-
soid. From the two plots in Fig. 9.1, we observe that

As mentioned, the period T of the periodic function is the time of one
complete cycle or the number of seconds per cycle. The reciprocal of
this quantity is the number of cycles per second, known as the cyclic
frequency f of the sinusoid. Thus,

Heinrich Rudorf Hertz (1857–1894), a German experimental physi-
cist, demonstrated that electromagnetic waves obey the same funda-
mental laws as light. His work conﬁrmed James Clerk Maxwell’s
celebrated 1864 theory and prediction that such waves existed.
Hertz was born into a prosperous family in Hamburg, Germany.
He attended the University of Berlin and did his doctorate under the
prominent physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. He became a professor
at Karlsruhe, where he began his quest for electromagnetic waves.
Hertz successfully generated and detected electromagnetic waves; he
was the ﬁrst to show that light is electromagnetic energy. In 1887, Hertz
noted for the ﬁrst time the photoelectric effect of electrons in a molec-
ular structure. Although Hertz only lived to the age of 37, his discov-
ery of electromagnetic waves paved the way for the practical use of
such waves in radio, television, and other communication systems. The
unit of frequency, the hertz, bears his name.
Historical
The unit of f is named after the German
physicist Heinrich R. Hertz (1857–1894).

Let us now consider a more general expression for the sinusoid,
(9.7)
where 
is the argument and 
is the phase. Both argument and
phase can be in radians or degrees.
Let us examine the two sinusoids

time. Therefore, we say that

then
and 
are said to be in phase; they reach their minima and max-
ima at exactly the same time. We can compare 
and 
in this man-
ner because they operate at the same frequency; they do not need to
have the same amplitude.

Two sinusoids with different phases.
A sinusoid can be expressed in either sine or cosine form. When
comparing two sinusoids, it is expedient to express both as either sine
or cosine with positive amplitudes. This is achieved by using the fol-
lowing trigonometric identities:
(9.9)
With these identities, it is easy to show that
(9.10)
Using these relationships, we can transform a sinusoid from sine form
to cosine form or vice versa.

A graphical approach may be used to relate or compare sinusoids
as an alternative to using the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and
(9.10). Consider the set of axes shown in Fig. 9.3(a). The horizontal axis
represents the magnitude of cosine, while the vertical axis (pointing
down) denotes the magnitude of sine. Angles are measured positively
counterclockwise from the horizontal, as usual in polar coordinates.
This graphical technique can be used to relate two sinusoids. For exam-
ple, we see in Fig. 9.3(a) that subtracting
from the argument of
gives
or
Similarly, adding
to
the argument of
gives
or
as
shown in Fig. 9.3(b).
The graphical technique can also be used to add two sinusoids of
the same frequency when one is in sine form and the other is in cosine
form. To add 
and 
we note that A is the magnitude of
while B is the magnitude of 
as shown in Fig. 9.4(a). The
magnitude and argument of the resultant sinusoid in cosine form is
readily obtained from the triangle. Thus,
(9.11)
where
(9.12)
For example, we may add 
and 
as shown in Fig. 9.4(b)
and obtain
(9.13)
Compared with the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and
(9.10), the graphical approach eliminates memorization. However, we

Practice Problem 9.2
A phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and
phase of a sinusoid.
Phasors provide a simple means of analyzing linear circuits excited by
sinusoidal sources; solutions of such circuits would be intractable oth-
erwise. The notion of solving ac circuits using phasors was ﬁrst intro-
duced by Charles Steinmetz in 1893. Before we completely deﬁne
phasors and apply them to circuit analysis, we need to be thoroughly
familiar with complex numbers.
A complex number z can be written in rectangular form as
(9.14a)
where 
x is the real part of z; y is the imaginary part of z.
In this context, the variables x and y do not represent a location as in
two-dimensional vector analysis but rather the real and imaginary parts
of z in the complex plane. Nevertheless, we note that there are some
resemblances between manipulating complex numbers and manipulat-
ing two-dimensional vectors.
The complex number z can also be written in polar or exponential
form as
(9.14b)
z  r lf  re jf
j  11;
z  x  jy
Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865–1923)
was a German-Austrian mathematician
and electrical engineer.
Appendix B presents a short tutorial on
complex numbers.

where r is the magnitude of z, and 
is the phase of z. We notice that
z can be represented in three ways:
(9.15)
The relationship between the rectangular form and the polar form
is shown in Fig. 9.6, where the x axis represents the real part and the
y axis represents the imaginary part of a complex number. Given x and
y, we can get r and 
as
(9.16a)
On the other hand, if we know r and 
we can obtain x and y as
(9.16b)
Thus, z may be written as
(9.17)
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are better performed
in rectangular form; multiplication and division are better done in polar
form. Given the complex numbers
the following operations are important.

Phasors

Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865–1923), a German-Austrian
mathematician and engineer, introduced the phasor method (covered in
this chapter) in ac circuit analysis. He is also noted for his work on the
theory of hysteresis.
Steinmetz was born in Breslau, Germany, and lost his mother at the
age of one. As a youth, he was forced to leave Germany because of
his political activities just as he was about to complete his doctoral dis-
sertation in mathematics at the University of Breslau. He migrated to
Switzerland and later to the United States, where he was employed by
General Electric in 1893. That same year, he published a paper in
which complex numbers were used to analyze ac circuits for the ﬁrst
time. This led to one of his many textbooks, Theory and Calculation
of ac Phenomena, published by McGraw-Hill in 1897. In 1901, he
became the president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,
which later became the IEEE.

Sinusoids and Phasors

V is thus the phasor representation of the sinusoid 
as we said ear-
lier. In other words, a phasor is a complex representation of the mag-
nitude and phase of a sinusoid. Either Eq. (9.20a) or Eq. (9.20b) can
be used to develop the phasor, but the standard convention is to use
Eq. (9.20a).
One way of looking at Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24) is to consider the plot
of the sinor
on the complex plane. As time increases,
the sinor rotates on a circle of radius 
at an angular velocity 
in the
counterclockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 9.7(a). We may regard 
as the projection of the sinor 
on the real axis, as shown in
Fig. 9.7(b). The value of the sinor at time 
is the phasor V of the
sinusoid 
The sinor may be regarded as a rotating phasor. Thus, when-
ever a sinusoid is expressed as a phasor, the term 
is implicitly pres-
ent. It is therefore important, when dealing with phasors, to keep in mind
the frequency 
of the phasor; otherwise we can make serious mistakes.

Equation (9.23) states that to obtain the sinusoid corresponding to
a given phasor V, multiply the phasor by the time factor 
and take
the real part. As a complex quantity, a phasor may be expressed in rec-
tangular form, polar form, or exponential form. Since a phasor has
magnitude and phase (“direction”), it behaves as a vector and is printed
in boldface. For example, phasors 
and 
are
graphically represented in Fig. 9.8. Such a graphical representation of
phasors is known as a phasor diagram.
Equations (9.21) through (9.23) reveal that to get the phasor cor-
responding to a sinusoid, we ﬁrst express the sinusoid in the cosine
form so that the sinusoid can be written as the real part of a complex
number. Then we take out the time factor 
and whatever is left is
the phasor corresponding to the sinusoid. By suppressing the time fac-
tor, we transform the sinusoid from the time domain to the phasor
domain. This transformation is summarized as follows:

We use lightface italic letters such as
z to represent complex numbers but
boldface letters such as V to represent
phasors, because phasors are vector-
like quantities.

Given a sinusoid 
we obtain the corre-
sponding phasor as 
Equation (9.25) is also demonstrated
in Table 9.1, where the sine function is considered in addition to the
cosine function. From Eq. (9.25), we see that to get the phasor repre-
sentation of a sinusoid, we express it in cosine form and take the
magnitude and phase. Given a phasor, we obtain the time domain
representation as the cosine function with the same magnitude as the
phasor and the argument as 
plus the phase of the phasor. The idea
of expressing information in alternate domains is fundamental to all
areas of engineering.

This shows that the derivative

as 
(9.27)
(Time domain)
(Phasor domain)
Similarly, the integral of 
is transformed to the phasor domain
as
(9.28)
(Time domain)
(Phasor domain)
Equation (9.27) allows the replacement of a derivative with respect
to time with multiplication of 
in the phasor domain, whereas
Eq. (9.28) allows the replacement of an integral with respect to time
with division by 
in the phasor domain. Equations (9.27) and (9.28)
are useful in ﬁnding the steady-state solution, which does not require
knowing the initial values of the variable involved. This is one of the
important applications of phasors.
Besides time differentiation and integration, another important
use of phasors is found in summing sinusoids of the same fre-
quency. This is best illustrated with an example, and Example 9.6
provides one.
The differences between 
and V should be emphasized:
1.
is the instantaneous or time domain representation, while 
is
the frequency or phasor domain representation.
2.
is time dependent, while 
is not. (This fact is often forgot-
ten by students.)
3.
is always real with no complex term, while 
is generally
complex.
Finally, we should bear in mind that phasor analysis applies only when
frequency is constant; it applies in manipulating two or more sinusoidal
signals only if they are of the same frequency.

Phasor Relationships
for Circuit Elements
Now that we know how to represent a voltage or current in the pha-
sor or frequency domain, one may legitimately ask how we apply this
to circuits involving the passive elements R, L, and C. What we need
to do is to transform the voltage-current relationship from the time
domain to the frequency domain for each element. Again, we will
assume the passive sign convention.
We begin with the resistor. If the current through a resistor R is
the voltage across it is given by Ohm’s law as
(9.29)
The phasor form of this voltage is
(9.30)
But the phasor representation of the current is 
Hence,

showing that the voltage-current relation for the resistor in the phasor
domain continues to be Ohm’s law, as in the time domain. Figure 9.9
illustrates the voltage-current relations of a resistor. We should note
from Eq. (9.31) that voltage and current are in phase, as illustrated in
the phasor diagram in Fig. 9.10.
For the inductor L, assume the current through it is 
The voltage across the inductor is

Recall from Eq. (9.10) that 
We can write the
voltage as

current lags the voltage by 
Figure 9.11 shows the voltage-current
relations for the inductor. Figure 9.12 shows the phasor diagram.
For the capacitor C, assume the voltage across it is 
The current through the capacitor is

By following the same steps as we took for the inductor or by apply-
ing Eq. (9.27) on Eq. (9.36), we obtain

In the preceding section, we obtained the voltage-current relations for
the three passive elements as
(9.38)
These equations may be written in terms of the ratio of the phasor volt-
age to the phasor current as
(9.39)
From these three expressions, we obtain Ohm’s law in phasor form for
any type of element as

Impedance and Admittance

The impedance represents the opposition that the circuit exhibits to
the ﬂow of sinusoidal current. Although the impedance is the ratio of
two phasors, it is not a phasor, because it does not correspond to a sinu-
soidally varying quantity.
The impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors can be
readily obtained from Eq. (9.39). Table 9.3 summarizes their imped-
ances. From the table we notice that 
and 
Consider two extreme cases of angular frequency. When

know—that the inductor acts like a short circuit, while the capacitor
acts like an open circuit. When

indicating that the inductor is an open circuit
to high frequencies, while the capacitor is a short circuit. Figure 9.15
illustrates this.
As a complex quantity, the impedence may be expressed in rec-
tangular form as
(9.41)
where 
is the resistance and 
is the reactance. The
reactance X may be positive or negative. We say that the impedance is
inductive when X is positive or capacitive when X is negative. Thus,
impedance 
is said to be inductive or lagging since current
lags voltage, while impedance 
is capacitive or leading
because current leads voltage. The impedance, resistance, and reactance
are all measured in ohms. The impedance may also be expressed in
polar form as

Applications
In Chapters 7 and 8, we saw certain uses of RC, RL, and RLC circuits
in dc applications. These circuits also have ac applications; among them
are coupling circuits, phase-shifting circuits, ﬁlters, resonant circuits, ac
bridge circuits, and transformers. This list of applications is inexhaus-
tive. We will consider some of them later. It will sufﬁce here to observe
two simple ones: RC phase-shifting circuits, and ac bridge circuits.
9.8.1
Phase-Shifters
A phase-shifting circuit is often employed to correct an undesirable
phase shift already present in a circuit or to produce special desired
effects. An RC circuit is suitable for this purpose because its capacitor
causes the circuit current to lead the applied voltage. Two commonly
used RC circuits are shown in Fig. 9.31. (RL circuits or any reactive
circuits could also serve the same purpose.)
In Fig. 9.31(a), the circuit current I leads the applied voltage 
by some phase angle 
where 
depending on the values
of R and C. If 
then the total impedance is 
and the phase shift is given by
(9.70)
This shows that the amount of phase shift depends on the values of R,
C, and the operating frequency. Since the output voltage 
across the
resistor is in phase with the current, 
leads (positive phase shift) 
as shown in Fig. 9.32(a).
In Fig. 9.31(b), the output is taken across the capacitor. The cur-
rent I leads the input voltage 
by 
but the output voltage 
across
the capacitor lags (negative phase shift) the input voltage 
as illus-
trated in Fig. 9.32(b).

Phase shift in RC circuits: (a) leading output, (b) lagging output.

We should keep in mind that the simple RC circuits in Fig. 9.31
also act as voltage dividers. Therefore, as the phase shift approaches
the output voltage 
approaches zero. For this reason, these
simple RC circuits are used only when small amounts of phase shift
are required. If it is desired to have phase shifts greater than 
simple RC networks are cascaded, thereby providing a total phase
shift equal to the sum of the individual phase shifts. In practice, the
phase shifts due to the stages are not equal, because the succeeding
stages load down the earlier stages unless op amps are used to sep-
arate the stages.

AC Bridges
An ac bridge circuit is used in measuring the inductance L of an
inductor or the capacitance C of a capacitor. It is similar in form to
the Wheatstone bridge for measuring an unknown resistance (dis-
cussed in Section 4.10) and follows the same principle. To measure
L and C, however, an ac source is needed as well as an ac meter

instead of the galvanometer. The ac meter may be a sensitive ac
ammeter or voltmeter.
Consider the general ac bridge circuit displayed in Fig. 9.37. The
bridge is balanced when no current ﬂows through the meter. This
means that 
Applying the voltage division principle,
(9.71)
Thus,
(9.72)
or
(9.73)
This is the balanced equation for the ac bridge and is similar to Eq. (4.30)
for the resistance bridge except that the R’s are replaced by Z’s.
Speciﬁc ac bridges for measuring L and C are shown in Fig. 9.38,
where 
and 
are the unknown inductance and capacitance to be
measured while 
and 
are a standard inductance and capacitance
(the values of which are known to great precision). In each case, two
resistors, 
and 
are varied until the ac meter reads zero. Then the
bridge is balanced. From Eq. (9.73), we obtain
(9.74)
and
(9.75)
Notice that the balancing of the ac bridges in Fig. 9.38 does not depend
on the frequency f of the ac source, since f does not appear in the rela-
tionships in Eqs. (9.74) and (9.75).

to the fact that they balance the given quantities. Since a parallel

3. Alternative. Although there are alternative techniques that can
be used to ﬁnd the unknown values, a straightforward equality
works best. Once we have answers, we can check them by using
hand techniques such as nodal analysis or just using PSpice.

By equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain
We have assumed a parallel RC combination which works in
this case.
5. Evaluate. Let us now use PSpice to see if we indeed have the
correct equalities. Running PSpice with the equivalent circuits,
an open circuit between the “bridge” portion of the circuit,
and a 10-volt input voltage yields the following voltages at the
ends of the “bridge” relative to a reference at the bottom of
the circuit:

9.993E+00 -8.634E-03
2.000E+03
9.993E+00 -8.637E-03
Since the voltages are essentially the same, then no measurable
current can ﬂow through the “bridge” portion of the circuit for
any element that connects the two points together and we have a
balanced bridge, which is to be expected. This indicates we have
properly determined the unknowns.
There is a very important problem with what we have done!
Do you know what that is? We have what can be called an
ideal, “theoretical” answer, but one that really is not very good
in the real world. The difference between the magnitudes of the
upper impedances and the lower impedances is much too large
and would never be accepted in a real bridge circuit. For
greatest accuracy, the overall magnitude of the impedances must
at least be within the same relative order. To increase the
accuracy of the solution of this problem, I would recommend
increasing the magnitude of the top impedances to be in the
range of 
to
One additional real-world comment:
The size of these impedances also creates serious problems in
making actual measurements, so the appropriate instruments
must be used in order to minimize their loading (which would
change the actual voltage readings) on the circuit.
6. Satisfactory? Since we solved for the unknown terms and then
tested to see if they woked, we validated the results. They can
now be presented as a solution to the problem.

Summary
1. A sinusoid is a signal in the form of the sine or cosine function.
It has the general form
where 
is the amplitude, 
is the angular frequency,
is the argument, and 
is the phase.
2. A phasor is a complex quantity that represents both the magni-
tude and the phase of a sinusoid. Given the sinusoid 
its phasor V is
3. In ac circuits, voltage and current phasors always have a ﬁxed
relation to one another at any moment of time. If 
represents the voltage through an element and
represents the current through the element,
then 
if the element is a resistor, 
leads 
by 
if the
element is a capacitor, and 
lags 
by 
if the element is an
inductor.
4. The impedance Z of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage
across it to the phasor current through it:
The admittance Y is the reciprocal of impedance:
Impedances are combined in series or in parallel the same way as
resistances in series or parallel; that is, impedances in series add
while admittances in parallel add.

Career in Power Systems
The discovery of the principle of an ac generator by Michael Faraday
in 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering; it provided a con-
venient way of generating the electric power that is needed in every
electronic, electrical, or electromechanical device we use now.
Electric power is obtained by converting energy from sources such
as fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal), nuclear fuel (uranium), hydro energy
(water falling through a head), geothermal energy (hot water, steam),
wind energy, tidal energy, and biomass energy (wastes). These various
ways of generating electric power are studied in detail in the ﬁeld of
power engineering, which has become an indispensable subdiscipline
of electrical engineering. An electrical engineer should be familiar with
the analysis, generation, transmission, distribution, and cost of electric
power.
The electric power industry is a very large employer of electrical
engineers. The industry includes thousands of electric utility systems
ranging from large, interconnected systems serving large regional areas
to small power companies serving individual communities or factories.
Due to the complexity of the power industry, there are numerous elec-
trical engineering jobs in different areas of the industry: power plant
(generation), transmission and distribution, maintenance, research, data
acquisition and ﬂow control, and management. Since electric power is
used everywhere, electric utility companies are everywhere, offering
exciting training and steady employment for men and women in thou-
sands of communities throughout the world.

Introduction
Our effort in ac circuit analysis so far has been focused mainly on cal-
culating voltage and current. Our major concern in this chapter is
power analysis.
Power analysis is of paramount importance. Power is the most
important quantity in electric utilities, electronic, and communication
systems, because such systems involve transmission of power from one
point to another. Also, every industrial and household electrical
device—every fan, motor, lamp, pressing iron, TV, personal computer—
has a power rating that indicates how much power the equipment
requires; exceeding the power rating can do permanent damage to an
appliance. The most common form of electric power is 50- or 60-Hz
ac power. The choice of ac over dc allowed high-voltage power trans-
mission from the power generating plant to the consumer.
We will begin by deﬁning and deriving instantaneous power and
average power. We will then introduce other power concepts. As prac-
tical applications of these concepts, we will discuss how power is
measured and reconsider how electric utility companies charge their
customers.
Instantaneous and Average Power
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the instantaneous power p(t) absorbed by
an element is the product of the instantaneous voltage v(t) across the
element and the instantaneous current i(t) through it. Assuming the pas-
sive sign convention,

Chapter 11
AC Power Analysis
The instantaneous power (in watts) is the power at any instant of time.
It is the rate at which an element absorbs energy.
Consider the general case of instantaneous power absorbed by an
arbitrary combination of circuit elements under sinusoidal excitation,
as shown in Fig. 11.1. Let the voltage and current at the terminals of
the circuit be
(11.2a)
(11.2b)
where 
and 
are the amplitudes (or peak values), and 
and 
are
the phase angles of the voltage and current, respectively. The instanta-
neous power absorbed by the circuit is
(11.3)
We apply the trigonometric identity

We can also think of the instantaneous
power as the power absorbed by the
element at a speciﬁc instant of time.

by lowercase letters.

and express Eq. (11.3) as
(11.5)
This shows us that the instantaneous power has two parts. The ﬁrst part
is constant or time independent. Its value depends on the phase differ-
ence between the voltage and the current. The second part is a sinu-
soidal function whose frequency is 
which is twice the angular
frequency of the voltage or current.
A sketch of p(t) in Eq. (11.5) is shown in Fig. 11.2, where 
is the period of voltage or current. We observe that p(t) is peri-
odic, 
and has a period of 
since its fre-
quency is twice that of voltage or current. We also observe that p(t)
is positive for some part of each cycle and negative for the rest of
the cycle. When p(t) is positive, power is absorbed by the circuit.
When p(t) is negative, power is absorbed by the source; that is,
power is transferred from the circuit to the source. This is possible
because of the storage elements (capacitors and inductors) in the
circuit.

Instantaneous and Average Power

The average power, in watts, is the average of the instantaneous power
over one period.
Thus, the average power is given by
(11.6)
Although Eq. (11.6) shows the averaging done over T, we would get
the same result if we performed the integration over the actual period
of p(t) which is T0  T2.

p(t)
The instantaneous power changes with time and is therefore difﬁ-
cult to measure. The average power is more convenient to measure. In
fact, the wattmeter, the instrument for measuring power, responds to
average power.

Substituting p(t) in Eq. (11.5) into Eq. (11.6) gives
(11.7)
The ﬁrst integrand is constant, and the average of a constant is the same
constant. The second integrand is a sinusoid. We know that the aver-
age of a sinusoid over its period is zero because the area under the
sinusoid during a positive half-cycle is canceled by the area under it
during the following negative half-cycle. Thus, the second term in
Eq. (11.7) vanishes and the average power becomes
(11.8)
Since 
what is important is the difference
in the phases of the voltage and current.
Note that p(t) is time-varying while P does not depend on time. To
ﬁnd the instantaneous power, we must necessarily have v(t) and i(t) in
the time domain. But we can ﬁnd the average power when voltage and
current are expressed in the time domain, as in Eq. (11.8), or when they
are expressed in the frequency domain. The phasor forms of v(t) and i(t)
in Eq. (11.2) are 
and 
respectively. P is calculated
using Eq. (11.8) or using phasors V and I. To use phasors, we notice that
(11.9)
We recognize the real part of this expression as the average power P
according to Eq. (11.8). Thus,
(11.10)
Consider two special cases of Eq. (11.10). When 
the volt-
age and current are in phase. This implies a purely resistive circuit or
resistive load 
and

where 
Equation (11.11) shows that a purely resistive cir-
cuit absorbs power at all times. When 
we have a purely
reactive circuit, and

Maximum Average Power Transfer
In Section 4.8 we solved the problem of maximizing the power deliv-
ered by a power-supplying resistive network to a load 
Represent-
ing the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent, we proved that the
maximum power would be delivered to the load if the load resistance
is equal to the Thevenin resistance 
We now extend that
result to ac circuits.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 11.7, where an ac circuit is connected
to a load 
and is represented by its Thevenin equivalent. The load is
usually represented by an impedance, which may model an electric

The current through the load is

From Eq. (11.11), the average power delivered to the load is

Our objective is to adjust the load parameters 
and 
so that P is

Eq. (11.15), we obtain

for the sinusoidal steady state. Setting

Effective or RMS Value
The idea of effective value arises from the need to measure the effective-
ness of a voltage or current source in delivering power to a resistive load.
11.4
The effective value of a periodic current is the dc current that deliv-
ers the same average power to a resistor as the periodic current.

In Fig. 11.13, the circuit in (a) is ac while that of (b) is dc. Our objective
is to ﬁnd 
that will transfer the same power to resistor R as the sinu-
soid i. The average power absorbed by the resistor in the ac circuit is
(11.22)
while the power absorbed by the resistor in the dc circuit is
(11.23)
Equating the expressions in Eqs. (11.22) and (11.23) and solving for
, we obtain
(11.24)
The effective value of the voltage is found in the same way as current;
that is,
(11.25)
This indicates that the effective value is the (square) root of the mean
(or average) of the square of the periodic signal. Thus, the effective
value is often known as the root-mean-square value, or rms value for
short; and we write
(11.26)
For any periodic function x(t) in general, the rms value is given by

The effective value of a periodic signal is its root mean square (rms) value.

The average power in Eq. (11.8) can be written in terms of the rms
values.
(11.30)
Similarly, the average power absorbed by a resistor R in Eq. (11.11)
can be written as
(11.31)
When a sinusoidal voltage or current is speciﬁed, it is often in terms
of its maximum (or peak) value or its rms value, since its average value
is zero. The power industries specify phasor magnitudes in terms of their
rms values rather than peak values. For instance, the 110 V available at
every household is the rms value of the voltage from the power com-
pany. It is convenient in power analysis to express voltage and current
in their rms values. Also, analog voltmeters and ammeters are designed
to read directly the rms value of voltage and current, respectively.

Apparent Power and Power Factor

The apparent power is so called because it seems apparent that the power
should be the voltage-current product, by analogy with dc resistive cir-
cuits. It is measured in volt-amperes or VA to distinguish it from the
average or real power, which is measured in watts. The power factor is
dimensionless, since it is the ratio of the average power to the apparent
power,
(11.36)
The angle 
is called the power factor angle, since it is the
angle whose cosine is the power factor. The power factor angle is equal
to the angle of the load impedance if V is the voltage across the load
and I is the current through it. This is evident from the fact that

The apparent power (in VA) is the product of the rms values of volt-
age and current.
The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between volt-
age and current. It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance.
From Eq. (11.36), the power factor may be seen as that factor by which
the apparent power must be multiplied to obtain the real or average
power. The value of pf ranges between zero and unity. For a purely
resistive load, the voltage and current are in phase, so that

this case the average power is zero. In between these two extreme
cases, pf is said to be leading or lagging. Leading power factor means
that current leads voltage, which implies a capacitive load. Lagging

Complex Power
Considerable effort has been expended over the years to express
power relations as simply as possible. Power engineers have coined
the term complex power, which they use to ﬁnd the total effect of
parallel loads. Complex power is important in power analysis because
it contains all the information pertaining to the power absorbed by a
given load.
Consider the ac load in Fig. 11.20. Given the phasor form 
and 
of voltage 
and current 
the complex
power S absorbed by the ac load is the product of the voltage and the
complex conjugate of the current, or

Thus we may write Eq. (11.41) as
(11.44)
This equation can also be obtained from Eq. (11.9). We notice from
Eq. (11.44) that the magnitude of the complex power is the apparent
power; hence, the complex power is measured in volt-amperes (VA). Also,
we notice that the angle of the complex power is the power factor angle.
The complex power may be expressed in terms of the load imped-
ance Z. From Eq. (11.37), the load impedance Z may be written as
(11.45)
Thus, 
Substituting this into Eq. (11.41) gives
(11.46)
Since 
Eq. (11.46) becomes
(11.47)
where P and Q are the real and imaginary parts of the complex power;
that is,
(11.48)
(11.49)
P is the average or real power and it depends on the load’s resistance
R. Q depends on the load’s reactance X and is called the reactive (or
quadrature) power.
Comparing Eq. (11.44) with Eq. (11.47), we notice that
(11.50)
The real power P is the average power in watts delivered to a load; it
is the only useful power. It is the actual power dissipated by the load.
The reactive power Q is a measure of the energy exchange between the
source and the reactive part of the load. The unit of Q is the volt-ampere
reactive (VAR) to distinguish it from the real power, whose unit is the
watt. We know from Chapter 6 that energy storage elements neither dis-
sipate nor supply power, but exchange power back and forth with the
rest of the network. In the same way, the reactive power is being trans-
ferred back and forth between the load and the source. It represents a
lossless interchange between the load and the source. Notice that:
1.

2.
for capacitive loads (leading pf).

for inductive loads (lagging pf).

Chapter 11
AC Power Analysis
When working with the rms values of
currents or voltages, we may drop the
subscript rms if no confusion will be
caused by doing so.
Complex power (in VA) is the product of the rms voltage phasor and
the complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. As a complex quantity,
its real part is real power P and its imaginary part is reactive power Q.

Introducing the complex power enables us to obtain the real and reac-
tive powers directly from voltage and current phasors.
(11.51)
This shows how the complex power contains all the relevant power
information in a given load.
It is a standard practice to represent S, P, and Q in the form of a
triangle, known as the power triangle, shown in Fig. 11.21(a). This is
similar to the impedance triangle showing the relationship between Z,
R, and X, illustrated in Fig. 11.21(b). The power triangle has four
items—the apparent/complex power, real power, reactive power, and
the power factor angle. Given two of these items, the other two can
easily be obtained from the triangle. As shown in Fig. 11.22, when S
lies in the ﬁrst quadrant, we have an inductive load and a lagging pf.
When S lies in the fourth quadrant, the load is capacitive and the pf is
leading. It is also possible for the complex power to lie in the second
or third quadrant. This requires that the load impedance have a nega-
tive resistance, which is possible with active circuits.

If the loads are connected in series with the voltage source, as
shown in Fig. 11.23(b), KVL yields
(11.54)
The complex power supplied by the source is
(11.55)
where 
and 
denote the complex powers delivered to loads 
and
respectively.
We conclude from Eqs. (11.53) and (11.55) that whether the loads
are connected in series or in parallel (or in general), the total power
supplied by the source equals the total power delivered to the load.
Thus, in general, for a source connected to N loads,
(11.56)
This means that the total complex power in a network is the sum of
the complex powers of the individual components. (This is also true of
real power and reactive power, but not true of apparent power.) This
expresses the principle of conservation of ac power:

In fact, all forms of ac power are con-
served: instantaneous, real, reactive,
and complex.
The complex, real, and reactive powers of the sources equal the
respective sums of the complex, real, and reactive powers of the indi-
vidual loads.
From this we imply that the real (or reactive) power ﬂow from sources
in a network equals the real (or reactive) power ﬂow into the other ele-
ments in the network.

Practice Problem 11.14

Power Factor Correction
Most domestic loads (such as washing machines, air conditioners, and
refrigerators) and industrial loads (such as induction motors) are induc-
tive and operate at a low lagging power factor. Although the inductive
nature of the load cannot be changed, we can increase its power factor.
11.8
11.8
Power Factor Correction
481
The process of increasing the power factor without altering the voltage
or current to the original load is known as power factor correction.
Since most loads are inductive, as shown in Fig. 11.27(a), a load’s
power factor is improved or corrected by deliberately installing a
capacitor in parallel with the load, as shown in Fig. 11.27(b). The effect
of adding the capacitor can be illustrated using either the power trian-
gle or the phasor diagram of the currents involved. Figure 11.28 shows
the latter, where it is assumed that the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) has a
power factor of 
while the one in Fig. 11.27(b) has a power fac-
tor of 
It is evident from Fig. 11.28 that adding the capacitor has
caused the phase angle between the supplied voltage and current to
reduce from 
to 
thereby increasing the power factor. We also
notice from the magnitudes of the vectors in Fig. 11.28 that with the
same supplied voltage, the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) draws larger current
than the current I drawn by the circuit in Fig. 11.27(b). Power com-
panies charge more for larger currents, because they result in increased
power losses (by a squared factor, since 
). Therefore, it is ben-
eﬁcial to both the power company and the consumer that every effort
is made to minimize current level or keep the power factor as close to
unity as possible. By choosing a suitable size for the capacitor, the cur-
rent can be made to be completely in phase with the voltage, imply-
ing unity power factor.

Alternatively, power factor correction
may be viewed as the addition of a re-

But from Eq. (11.46), 
The value of the
required shunt capacitance C is determined as

Note that the real power P dissipated by the load is not affected by the
power factor correction because the average power due to the capaci-
tance is zero.
Although the most common situation in practice is that of an
inductive load, it is also possible that the load is capacitive; that is, the
load is operating at a leading power factor. In this case, an inductor
should be connected across the load for power factor correction. The
required shunt inductance L can be calculated from

Practice Problem 11.15
Applications
In this section, we consider two important application areas: how power
is measured and how electric utility companies determine the cost of
electricity consumption.
11.9.1
Power Measurement
The average power absorbed by a load is measured by an instrument
called the wattmeter.
11.9
The wattmeter is the instrument used for measuring the average power.
Figure 11.30 shows a wattmeter that consists essentially of two
coils: the current coil and the voltage coil. A current coil with very low
impedance (ideally zero) is connected in series with the load (Fig. 11.31)
and responds to the load current. The voltage coil with very high imped-
ance (ideally inﬁnite) is connected in parallel with the load as shown
in Fig. 11.31 and responds to the load voltage. The current coil acts
like a short circuit because of its low impedance; the voltage coil
Reactive power is measured by an
instrument called the varmeter. The
varmeter is often connected to the
load in the same way as the wattmeter.
Some wattmeters do not have coils;
the wattmeter considered here is the
electromagnetic type.

behaves like an open circuit because of its high impedance. As a result,
the presence of the wattmeter does not disturb the circuit or have an
effect on the power measurement.
When the two coils are energized, the mechanical inertia of the mov-
ing system produces a deﬂection angle that is proportional to the aver-
age value of the product 
If the current and voltage of the load
are 
and 
their corre-
sponding rms phasors are

and the wattmeter measures the average power given by
(11.63)
As shown in Fig. 11.31, each wattmeter coil has two terminals with
one marked 
To ensure upscale deﬂection, the 
terminal of the cur-
rent coil is toward the source, while the 
terminal of the voltage coil
is connected to the same line as the current coil. Reversing both coil
connections still results in upscale deﬂection. However, reversing one
coil and not the other results in downscale deﬂection and no wattmeter
reading.

Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is clearly deﬁned. Interestingly, this is a
problem where the student could actually validate the results by
doing the problem in the laboratory with a real wattmeter.

2. Present. This problem consists of ﬁnding the average power
delivered to a load by an external source with a series impedance.
3. Alternative. This is a straightforward circuit problem where all
we need to do is ﬁnd the magnitude and phase of the current
through the load and the magnitude and the phase of the voltage
across the load. These quantities could also be found by using
PSpice, which we will use as a check.
4. Attempt. In Fig. 11.32, the wattmeter reads the average power
absorbed by the 
impedance because the current coil
is in series with the impedance while the voltage coil is in
parallel with it. The current through the circuit is

11.9.2
Electricity Consumption Cost
In Section 1.7, we considered a simpliﬁed model of the way the cost of
electricity consumption is determined. But the concept of power factor
was not included in the calculations. Now we consider the importance
of power factor in electricity consumption cost.
Loads with low power factors are costly to serve because they
require large currents, as explained in Section 11.8. The ideal situa-
tion would be to draw minimum current from a supply so that 
and 
. A load with nonzero Q means that energy ﬂows
back and forth between the load and the source, giving rise to addi-
tional power losses. In view of this, power companies often encour-
age their customers to have power factors as close to unity as possible
and penalize some customers who do not improve their load power
factors.
Utility companies divide their customers into categories: as resi-
dential (domestic), commercial, and industrial, or as small power,
medium power, and large power. They have different rate structures for
each category. The amount of energy consumed in units of kilowatt-
hours (kWh) is measured using a kilowatt-hour meter installed at the
customer’s premises.
Although utility companies use different methods for charging cus-
tomers, the tariff or charge to a consumer is often two-part. The ﬁrst
part is ﬁxed and corresponds to the cost of generation, transmission,
and distribution of electricity to meet the load requirements of the con-
sumers. This part of the tariff is generally expressed as a certain price
pf  1
P, Q  0,
S 

per kW of maximum demand. Or it may be based on kVA of maxi-
mum demand, to account for the power factor (pf) of the consumer. A
pf penalty charge may be imposed on the consumer whereby a certain
percentage of kW or kVA maximum demand is charged for every 0.01
fall in pf below a prescribed value, say 0.85 or 0.9. On the other hand,
a pf credit may be given for every 0.01 that the pf exceeds the pre-
scribed value.
The second part is proportional to the energy consumed in kWh;
it may be in graded form, for example, the ﬁrst 100 kWh at 16 cents/kWh,
the next 200 kWh at 10 cents/kWh and so forth. Thus, the bill is deter-
mined based on the following equation:
(11.64)
Total Cost  Fixed Cost  Cost of Energy
11.9
Applications
487
A manufacturing industry consumes 200 MWh in one month. If the
maximum demand is 1,600 kW, calculate the electricity bill based on
the following two-part rate:
Demand charge: $5.00 per month per kW of billing demand.
Energy charge: 8 cents per kWh for the ﬁrst 50,000 kWh,
5 cents per kWh for the remaining energy.
Solution:
The demand charge is
(11.17.1)
The energy charge for the ﬁrst 50,000 kWh is
(11.17.2)
The remaining energy is 
and the corresponding energy charge is
(11.17.3)
Adding the results of Eqs. (11.17.1) to (11.17.3) gives
It may appear that the cost of electricity is too high. But this is often a
small fraction of the overall cost of production of the goods manufactured
or the selling price of the ﬁnished product.

A 300-kW load supplied at 13 kV (rms) operates 520 hours a month

on this simpliﬁed tariff:
Energy charge: 6 cents per kWh
Power-factor penalty: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01

that pf exceeds 0.85.
Solution:
The energy consumed is
The operating power factor 
is 
below the
prescribed power factor of 0.85. Since there is 0.1 percent energy charge
for every 0.01, there is a power-factor penalty charge of 0.5 percent.

Inductors and capacitors absorb no average power, while the aver-
age power absorbed by a resistor is 
3. Maximum average power is transferred to a load when the load
impedance is the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedance
as seen from the load terminals, 
4. The effective value of a periodic signal x(t) is its root-mean-square
(rms) value.
For a sinusoid, the effective or rms value is its amplitude divided
by 
5. The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between
voltage and current:
It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance or the ratio
of real power to apparent power. The pf is lagging if the current
lags voltage (inductive load) and is leading when the current leads
voltage (capacitive load).
6. Apparent power S (in VA) is the product of the rms values of volt-
age and current:
It is also given by 
where P is the real
power and Q is reactive power.
7. Reactive power (in VAR) is:
8. Complex power S (in VA) is the product of the rms voltage pha-
sor and the complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. It is also
the complex sum of real power P and reactive power Q.
Also,
9. The total complex power in a network is the sum of the complex
powers of the individual components. Total real power and reac-
tive power are also, respectively, the sums of the individual real
powers and the reactive powers, but the total apparent power is
not calculated by the process.
10. Power factor correction is necessary for economic reasons; it is the
process of improving the power factor of a load by reducing the
overall reactive power.
11. The wattmeter is the instrument for measuring the average power.
Energy consumed is measured with a kilowatt-hour meter.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.e), “an ability to identify, formulate,
and solve engineering problems.”
Developing and enhancing your “ability to identify, formulate, and
solve engineering problems” is a primary focus of textbook. Follow-
ing our six step problem-solving process is the best way to practice
this skill. Our recommendation is that you use this process whenever
possible. You may be pleased to learn that this process works well for
nonengineering courses.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (f), “an understanding of professional
and ethical responsibility.”
“An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” is required
of every engineer. To some extent, this understanding is very personal
for each of us. Let us identify some pointers to help you develop this
understanding. One of my favorite examples is that an engineer has the
responsibility to answer what I call the “unasked question.” For
instance, assume that you own a car that has a problem with the trans-
mission. In the process of selling that car, the prospective buyer asks
you if there is a problem in the right-front wheel bearing. You answer
no. However, as an engineer, you are required to inform the buyer that
there is a problem with the transmission without being asked.
Your responsibility both professionally and ethically is to perform
in a manner that does not harm those around you and to whom you are
responsible. Clearly, developing this capability will take time and matu-
rity on your part. I recommend practicing this by looking for profes-
sional and ethical components in your day-to-day activities.

Introduction
So far in this text, we have dealt with single-phase circuits. A single-phase
ac power system consists of a generator connected through a pair of wires
(a transmission line) to a load. Figure 12.1(a) depicts a single-phase two-
wire system, where 
is the rms magnitude of the source voltage and 
is the phase. What is more common in practice is a single-phase three-
wire system, shown in Fig. 12.1(b). It contains two identical sources
(equal magnitude and the same phase) that are connected to two loads by
two outer wires and the neutral. For example, the normal household sys-
tem is a single-phase three-wire system because the terminal voltages
have the same magnitude and the same phase. Such a system allows the
connection of both 120-V and 240-V appliances.

Single-phase systems: (a) two-wire type, (b) three-wire type.
Circuits or systems in which the ac sources operate at the same fre-
quency but different phases are known as polyphase. Figure 12.2 shows
a two-phase three-wire system, and Fig. 12.3 shows a three-phase four-
wire system. As distinct from a single-phase system, a two-phase system
is produced by a generator consisting of two coils placed perpendicular
to each other so that the voltage generated by one lags the other by 
By the same token, a three-phase system is produced by a generator con-
sisting of three sources having the same amplitude and frequency but out
of phase with each other by 
Since the three-phase system is by far
the most prevalent and most economical polyphase system, discussion in
this chapter is mainly on three-phase systems.
Three-phase systems are important for at least three reasons. First,
nearly all electric power is generated and distributed in three-phase, at
the operating frequency of 60 Hz (or 
) in the United
States or 50 Hz (or 
) in some other parts of the world.
When one-phase or two-phase inputs are required, they are taken from
the three-phase system rather than generated independently. Even when
more than three phases are needed—such as in the aluminum industry,
where 48 phases are required for melting purposes—they can be provided
by manipulating the three phases supplied. Second, the instantaneous
power in a three-phase system can be constant (not pulsating), as we
will see in Section 12.7. This results in uniform power transmission
and less vibration of three-phase machines. Third, for the same amount
of power, the three-phase system is more economical than the single-
phase. The amount of wire required for a three-phase system is less
than that required for an equivalent single-phase system.

We begin with a discussion of balanced three-phase voltages. Then
we analyze each of the four possible conﬁgurations of balanced three-
phase systems. We also discuss the analysis of unbalanced three-phase
systems. We learn how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze a bal-
anced or unbalanced three-phase system. Finally, we apply the concepts
developed in this chapter to three-phase power measurement and resi-
dential electrical wiring.
Balanced Three-Phase Voltages
Three-phase voltages are often produced with a three-phase ac gener-
ator (or alternator) whose cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 12.4.
The generator basically consists of a rotating magnet (called the rotor)
surrounded by a stationary winding (called the stator). Three separate

Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Croatian-American engineer whose
inventions—among them the induction motor and the ﬁrst polyphase ac
power system—greatly inﬂuenced the settlement of the ac versus dc de-
bate in favor of ac. He was also responsible for the adoption of 60 Hz as
the standard for ac power systems in the United States.
Born in Austria-Hungary (now Croatia), to a clergyman, Tesla had
an incredible memory and a keen afﬁnity for mathematics. He moved
to the United States in 1884 and ﬁrst worked for Thomas Edison. At
that time, the country was in the “battle of the currents” with George
Westinghouse (1846–1914) promoting ac and Thomas Edison rigidly
leading the dc forces. Tesla left Edison and joined Westinghouse
because of his interest in ac. Through Westinghouse, Tesla gained the
reputation and acceptance of his polyphase ac generation, transmission,
and distribution system. He held 700 patents in his lifetime. His other
inventions include high-voltage apparatus (the tesla coil) and a wire-
less transmission system. The unit of magnetic ﬂux density, the tesla,
was named in honor of him.

windings or coils with terminals 
and 
are physically
placed 
apart around the stator. Terminals a and 
for example,
stand for one of the ends of coils going into and the other end coming
out of the page. As the rotor rotates, its magnetic ﬁeld “cuts” the ﬂux
from the three coils and induces voltages in the coils. Because the coils
are placed 
apart, the induced voltages in the coils are equal in
magnitude but out of phase by 
(Fig. 12.5). Since each coil can be
regarded as a single-phase generator by itself, the three-phase genera-
tor can supply power to both single-phase and three-phase loads.
A typical three-phase system consists of three voltage sources con-
nected to loads by three or four wires (or transmission lines). (Three-
phase current sources are very scarce.) A three-phase system is
equivalent to three single-phase circuits. The voltage sources can be
either wye-connected as shown in Fig. 12.6(a) or delta-connected as in
Fig. 12.6(b).

As a common tradition in power
systems, voltage and current in this
chapter are in rms values unless
otherwise stated.
Reminder: As time increases, each
phasor (or sinor) rotates at an angular
velocity .

The phase sequence is the time order in which the voltages pass
through their respective maximum values.
The phase sequence is determined by the order in which the phasors
pass through a ﬁxed point in the phase diagram.
In Fig. 12.7(a), as the phasors rotate in the counterclockwise
direction with frequency 
they pass through the horizontal axis in a
sequence 
Thus, the sequence is abc or bca or cab. Sim-
ilarly, for the phasors in Fig. 12.7(b), as they rotate in the counter-
clockwise direction, they pass the horizontal axis in a sequence
This describes the acb sequence. The phase sequence is
important in three-phase power distribution. It determines the direc-
tion of the rotation of a motor connected to the power source, for
example.
Like the generator connections, a three-phase load can be either
wye-connected or delta-connected, depending on the end application.
Figure 12.8(a) shows a wye-connected load, and Fig. 12.8(b) shows a
delta-connected load. The neutral line in Fig. 12.8(a) may or may not
be there, depending on whether the system is four- or three-wire. (And,
of course, a neutral connection is topologically impossible for a delta
connection.) A wye- or delta-connected load is said to be unbalanced
if the phase impedances are not equal in magnitude or phase.

In subsequent sections, we will consider each of these possible con-
ﬁgurations.
It is appropriate to mention here that a balanced delta-connected
load is more common than a balanced wye-connected load. This is due
to the ease with which loads may be added or removed from each phase
of a delta-connected load. This is very difﬁcult with a wye-connected
load because the neutral may not be accessible. On the other hand,
delta-connected sources are not common in practice because of the cir-
culating current that will result in the delta-mesh if the three-phase volt-
ages are slightly unbalanced.

Balanced Wye-Wye Connection
We begin with the Y-Y system, because any balanced three-phase sys-
tem can be reduced to an equivalent Y-Y system. Therefore, analysis
of this system should be regarded as the key to solving all balanced
three-phase systems.

Balanced Wye-Wye Connection

A balanced Y-Y system is a three-phase system with a balanced 
Y-connected source and a balanced Y-connected load.
Consider the balanced four-wire Y-Y system of Fig. 12.9, where a
Y-connected load is connected to a Y-connected source. We assume a
balanced load so that load impedances are equal. Although the imped-
ance 
is the total load impedance per phase, it may also be regarded
as the sum of the source impedance 
line impedance 
and load
impedance 
for each phase, since these impedances are in series. As
illustrated in Fig. 12.9, 
denotes the internal impedance of the phase
winding of the generator; 
is the impedance of the line joining a
phase of the source with a phase of the load; 
is the impedance of
each phase of the load; and 
is the impedance of the neutral line.
Thus, in general

The line-to-line voltages or simply line voltages 
and 
are
related to the phase voltages. For example,
(12.11a)
Similarly, we can obtain
(12.11b)
(12.11c)
Thus, the magnitude of the line voltages

of the phase voltages 
or
(12.12)
where
(12.13)
and
(12.14)
Also the line voltages lead their corresponding phase voltages by 
Figure 12.11(a) illustrates this. Figure 12.11(a) also shows how to
determine 
from the phase voltages, while Fig. 12.11(b) shows the
same for the three line voltages. Notice that 
leads 
by 
and
leads 
by 
so that the line voltages sum up to zero as do
the phase voltages.
Applying KVL to each phase in Fig. 12.10, we obtain the line cur-
rents as

We can readily infer that the line currents add up to zero,
(12.16)
so that

that is, the voltage across the neutral wire is zero. The neutral line can
thus be removed without affecting the system. In fact, in long distance
power transmission, conductors in multiples of three are used with the
earth itself acting as the neutral conductor. Power systems designed in
this way are well grounded at all critical points to ensure safety.
While the line current is the current in each line, the phase current
is the current in each phase of the source or load. In the Y-Y system, the
line current is the same as the phase current. We will use single subscripts

currents ﬂow from the source to the load.
An alternative way of analyzing a balanced Y-Y system is to do
so on a “per phase” basis. We look at one phase, say phase a, and ana-
lyze the single-phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.12. The single-phase
analysis yields the line current 
as
(12.18)
From 
we use the phase sequence to obtain other line currents. Thus,
as long as the system is balanced, we need only analyze one phase.
We may do this even if the neutral line is absent, as in the three-wire
system.

This is perhaps the most practical

the three-phase loads are usually

Another way to get these phase currents is to apply KVL. For
example, applying KVL around loop aABbna gives
or

which is the same as Eq. (12.21). This is the more general way of ﬁnd-

Also, the line currents lag the corresponding phase currents by

An alternative way of analyzing the 
circuit is to transform
the -connected load to an equivalent Y-connected load. Using the 
transformation formula in Eq. (12.8),
(12.28)
After this transformation, we now have a Y-Y system as in Fig. 12.10.
The three-phase 
system in Fig. 12.14 can be replaced by the single-
phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.16. This allows us to calculate only
the line currents. The phase currents are obtained using Eq. (12.25) and
utilizing the fact that each of the phase currents leads the correspon-
ding line current by 30.

The source as well as the load may be delta-connected as shown
in Fig. 12.17. Our goal is to obtain the phase and line currents as usual.

Assuming a positive sequence, the phase voltages for a delta-connected
source are
(12.29)
The line voltages are the same as the phase voltages. From Fig. 12.17,
assuming there is no line impedances, the phase voltages of the delta-

Hence,

Substituting Eq. (12.36) into Eq. (12.35) gives
(12.37)
From this, we obtain the other line currents 
and 
using the posi-
tive phase sequence, i.e., 
The phase
currents are equal to the line currents.
Another way to obtain the line currents is to replace the delta-
connected source with its equivalent wye-connected source, as shown
in Fig. 12.19. In Section 12.3, we found that the line-to-line voltages
of a wye-connected source lead their corresponding phase voltages by
Therefore, we obtain each phase voltage of the equivalent wye-
connected source by dividing the corresponding line voltage of the
delta-connected source by 
and shifting its phase by 
Thus,
the equivalent wye-connected source has the phase voltages
(12.38)
If the delta-connected source has source impedance 
per phase, the
equivalent wye-connected source will have a source impedance of 
per phase, according to Eq. (9.69).
Once the source is transformed to wye, the circuit becomes a wye-
wye system. Therefore, we can use the equivalent single-phase circuit
shown in Fig. 12.20, from which the line current for phase a is
(12.39)
which is the same as Eq. (12.37).

Alternatively, we may transform the wye-connected load to an

which can be analyzed as in Section 12.5. Note that
(12.40)
As stated earlier, the delta-connected load is more desirable than
the wye-connected load. It is easier to alter the loads in any one phase
of the delta-connected loads, as the individual loads are connected
directly across the lines. However, the delta-connected source is hardly
used in practice because any slight imbalance in the phase voltages will
result in unwanted circulating currents.

rents and voltages and line currents and voltages for the four con-

Power in a Balanced System
Let us now consider the power in a balanced three-phase system. We
begin by examining the instantaneous power absorbed by the load. This
requires that the analysis be done in the time domain. For a Y-connected
load, the phase voltages are
(12.41)
where the factor 
is necessary because 
has been deﬁned as the rms
value of the phase voltage. If 
the phase currents lag behind
their corresponding phase voltages by 
Thus,

phase circuits.

where 
is the rms value of the phase current. The total instantaneous
power in the load is the sum of the instantaneous powers in the three
phases; that is,
(12.43)
Applying the trigonometric identity
(12.44)
gives
(12.45)
where 
Thus the total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase system is
constant—it does not change with time as the instantaneous power of
each phase does. This result is true whether the load is Y- or -connected.
This is one important reason for using a three-phase system to generate
and distribute power. We will look into another reason a little later.
Since the total instantaneous power is independent of time, the
average power per phase 
for either the 
-connected load or the 
Y-connected load is 
or
(12.46)
and the reactive power per phase is
(12.47)
The apparent power per phase is
(12.48)
The complex power per phase is
(12.49)
where 
and 
are the phase voltage and phase current with magni-
tudes 
and 
respectively. The total average power is the sum of the
average powers in the phases:
(12.50)
For a Y-connected load, 
but 
whereas for a 
-connected load,

Thus, Eq. (12.50) applies
for both Y-connected and 
-connected loads. Similarly, the total reac-
tive power is

Remember that

angle of the load impedance or the angle between the phase voltage
and the phase current.
A second major advantage of three-phase systems for power dis-
tribution is that the three-phase system uses a lesser amount of wire
than the single-phase system for the same line voltage 
and the same
absorbed power 
We will compare these cases and assume in both
that the wires are of the same material (e.g., copper with resistivity ),
of the same length 
and that the loads are resistive (i.e., unity power
factor). For the two-wire single-phase system in Fig. 12.21(a),

Practice Problem 12.7
Two balanced loads are connected to a 240-kV rms 60-Hz line, as
shown in Fig. 12.22(a). Load 1 draws 30 kW at a power factor of 0.6
lagging, while load 2 draws 45 kVAR at a power factor of 0.8 lagging.
Assuming the abc sequence, determine: (a) the complex, real, and reac-
tive powers absorbed by the combined load, (b) the line currents, and
(c) the kVAR rating of the three capacitors -connected in parallel with
the load that will raise the power factor to 0.9 lagging and the capac-
itance of each capacitor.

Practice Problem 12.8
Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems
This chapter would be incomplete without mentioning unbalanced
three-phase systems. An unbalanced system is caused by two possible
situations: (1) The source voltages are not equal in magnitude and/or
differ in phase by angles that are unequal, or (2) load impedances are
unequal. Thus,
12.8
An unbalanced system is due to unbalanced voltage sources or an
unbalanced load.
To simplify analysis, we will assume balanced source voltages, but an
unbalanced load.
Unbalanced three-phase systems are solved by direct application
of mesh and nodal analysis. Figure 12.23 shows an example of an
unbalanced three-phase system that consists of balanced source volt-
ages (not shown in the ﬁgure) and an unbalanced Y-connected load
(shown in the ﬁgure). Since the load is unbalanced, 
and 
are
not equal. The line currents are determined by Ohm’s law as

This set of unbalanced line currents produces current in the neutral line,
which is not zero as in a balanced system. Applying KCL at node N
gives the neutral line current as

In a three-wire system where the neutral line is absent, we can still
ﬁnd the line currents 
and 
using mesh analysis. At node N,
KCL must be satisﬁed so that 
in this case. The same
could be done for an unbalanced 
-Y, Y-
or 
three-wire system.
As mentioned earlier, in long distance power transmission, conductors
in multiples of three (multiple three-wire systems) are used, with the
earth itself acting as the neutral conductor.
To calculate power in an unbalanced three-phase system requires
that we ﬁnd the power in each phase using Eqs. (12.46) to (12.49). The
total power is not simply three times the power in one phase but the
sum of the powers in the three phases.

PSpice for Three-Phase Circuits
PSpice can be used to analyze three-phase balanced or unbalanced cir-
cuits in the same way it is used to analyze single-phase ac circuits.
However, a delta-connected source presents two major problems to
PSpice. First, a delta-connected source is a loop of voltage sources—
which PSpice does not like. To avoid this problem, we insert a resis-
tor of negligible resistance (say, 
per phase) into each phase of
the delta-connected source. Second, the delta-connected source does
not provide a convenient node for the ground node, which is necessary
to run PSpice. This problem can be eliminated by inserting balanced
wye-connected large resistors (say, 
per phase) in the delta-
connected source so that the neutral node of the wye-connected resis-
tors serves as the ground node 0. Example 12.12 will illustrate this.

Applications
Both wye and delta source connections have important practical appli-
cations. The wye source connection is used for long distance trans-
mission of electric power, where resistive losses (
) should be

minimal. This is due to the fact that the wye connection gives a line
voltage that is 
greater than the delta connection; hence, for the same
power, the line current is 
smaller. In addition, delta connected are
also undesirable due to the potential of having disastrous circulating cur-
rents. Sometimes, using transformers, we create the equivalent of delta
connect source. This conversion from three-phase to single-phase is
required in residential wiring, because household lighting and appli-
ances use single-phase power. Three-phase power is used in industrial
wiring where a large power is required. In some applications, it is imma-
terial whether the load is wye- or delta-connected. For example, both
connections are satisfactory with induction motors. In fact, some man-
ufacturers connect a motor in delta for 220 V and in wye for 440 V so
that one line of motors can be readily adapted to two different voltages.
Here we consider two practical applications of those concepts cov-
ered in this chapter: power measurement in three-phase circuits and
residential wiring.
12.10.1
Three-Phase Power Measurement
Section 11.9 presented the wattmeter as the instrument for measuring
the average (or real) power in single-phase circuits. A single wattmeter
can also measure the average power in a three-phase system that is bal-
anced, so that 
the total power is three times the read-
ing of that one wattmeter. However, two or three single-phase wattmeters
are necessary to measure power if the system is unbalanced. The three-
wattmeter method of power measurement, shown in Fig. 12.33, will
work regardless of whether the load is balanced or unbalanced, wye-
or delta-connected. The three-wattmeter method is well suited for
power measurement in a three-phase system where the power factor is
constantly changing. The total average power is the algebraic sum of
the three wattmeter readings,
(12.61)
where 
and 
correspond to the readings of wattmeters 
and 
respectively. Notice that the common or reference point o in
Fig. 12.33 is selected arbitrarily. If the load is wye-connected, point o
can be connected to the neutral point n. For a delta-connected load,
point o can be connected to any point. If point o is connected to point
b, for example, the voltage coil in wattmeter 
reads zero and 
indicating that wattmeter 
is not necessary. Thus, two wattmeters are
sufﬁcient to measure the total power.
The two-wattmeter method is the most commonly used method for
three-phase power measurement. The two wattmeters must be properly
connected to any two phases, as shown typically in Fig. 12.34. Notice
that the current coil of each wattmeter measures the line current, while
the respective voltage coil is connected between the line and the third
line and measures the line voltage. Also notice that the 
terminal of
the voltage coil is connected to the line to which the corresponding
current coil is connected. Although the individual wattmeters no longer
read the power taken by any particular phase, the algebraic sum of the
two wattmeter readings equals the total average power absorbed by the
load, regardless of whether it is wye- or delta-connected, balanced or

We will show here that the method works for a balanced three-phase
system.
Consider the balanced, wye-connected load in Fig. 12.35. Our
objective is to apply the two-wattmeter method to ﬁnd the average
power absorbed by the load. Assume the source is in the abc sequence
and the load impedance 
Due to the load impedance, each
voltage coil leads its current coil by

Comparing Eq. (12.68) with Eq. (12.51) shows
that the difference of the wattmeter readings is proportional to the total
reactive power, or
(12.69)
From Eqs. (12.67) and (12.69), the total apparent power can be
obtained as
(12.70)
Dividing Eq. (12.69) by Eq. (12.67) gives the tangent of the power fac-
tor angle as
(12.71)
from which we can obtain the power factor as 
Thus, the
two-wattmeter method not only provides the total real and reactive pow-
ers, it can also be used to compute the power factor. From Eqs. (12.67),
(12.69), and (12.71), we conclude that:
1. If 
the load is resistive.
2. If 
the load is inductive.
3. If 
the load is capacitive.
Although these results are derived from a balanced wye-connected
load, they are equally valid for a balanced delta-connected load. How-
ever, the two-wattmeter method cannot be used for power measurement
in a three-phase four-wire system unless the current through the neu-
tral line is zero. We use the three-wattmeter method to measure the real
power in a three-phase four-wire system.

Residential Wiring
In the United States, most household lighting and appliances operate on
120-V, 60-Hz, single-phase alternating current. (The electricity may also
be supplied at 110, 115, or 117 V, depending on the location.) The local
power company supplies the house with a three-wire ac system. Typi-
cally, as in Fig. 12.37, the line voltage of, say, 12,000 V is stepped down
to 120/240 V with a transformer (more details on transformers in the next
chapter). The three wires coming from the transformer are typically col-
ored red (hot), black (hot), and white (neutral). As shown in Fig. 12.38,
the two 120-V voltages are opposite in phase and hence add up to zero.
That is,

VW  0l0, VB  120l0, VR  120l180  VB.

Since most appliances are designed to operate with 120 V, the lighting
and appliances are connected to the 120-V lines, as illustrated in
Fig. 12.39 for a room. Notice in Fig. 12.37 that all appliances are con-
nected in parallel. Heavy appliances that consume large currents, such
as air conditioners, dishwashers, ovens, and laundry machines, are con-
nected to the 240-V power line.
Because of the dangers of electricity, house wiring is carefully reg-
ulated by a code drawn by local ordinances and by the National Elec-
trical Code (NEC). To avoid trouble, insulation, grounding, fuses, and
circuit breakers are used. Modern wiring codes require a third wire for
a separate ground. The ground wire does not carry power like the neu-
tral wire but enables appliances to have a separate ground connection.
Figure 12.40 shows the connection of the receptacle to a 120-V rms
line and to the ground. As shown in the ﬁgure, the neutral line is con-
nected to the ground (the earth) at many critical locations. Although
the ground line seems redundant, grounding is important for many
reasons. First, it is required by NEC. Second, grounding provides a

convenient path to ground for lightning that strikes the power line.
Third, grounds minimize the risk of electric shock. What causes shock
is the passage of current from one part of the body to another. The
human body is like a big resistor R. If V is the potential difference
between the body and the ground, the current through the body is deter-
mined by Ohm’s law as
(12.73)
The value of R varies from person to person and depends on whether
the body is wet or dry. How great or how deadly the shock is depends
on the amount of current, the pathway of the current through the
body, and the length of time the body is exposed to the current. Cur-
rents less than 1 mA may not be harmful to the body, but currents
greater than 10 mA can cause severe shock. A modern safety device
is the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), used in outdoor circuits
and in bathrooms, where the risk of electric shock is greatest. It is
essentially a circuit breaker that opens when the sum of the currents
and 
through the red, white, and the black lines is not equal
to zero, or 
The best way to avoid electric shock is to follow safety guide-
lines concerning electrical systems and appliances. Here are some of
them:
• Never assume that an electrical circuit is dead. Always check to
be sure.
• Use safety devices when necessary, and wear suitable clothing
(insulated shoes, gloves, etc.).
• Never use two hands when testing high-voltage circuits, since the
current through one hand to the other hand has a direct path
through your chest and heart.
• Do not touch an electrical appliance when you are wet. Remem-
ber that water conducts electricity.
• Be extremely careful when working with electronic appliances
such as radio and TV because these appliances have large capac-
itors in them. The capacitors take time to discharge after the power
is disconnected.
• Always have another person present when working on a wiring
system, just in case of an accident.

1. The phase sequence is the order in which the phase voltages of a
three-phase generator occur with respect to time. In an abc
sequence of balanced source voltages, 
leads 
by 
which in turn leads 
by 
In an acb sequence of balanced
voltages, 
leads

2. A balanced wye- or delta-connected load is one in which the three-
phase impedances are equal.
3. The easiest way to analyze a balanced three-phase circuit is to
transform both the source and the load to a Y-Y system and then
analyze the single-phase equivalent circuit. Table 12.1 presents a
summary of the formulas for phase currents and voltages and line
currents and voltages for the four possible conﬁgurations.
4. The line current 
is the current ﬂowing from the generator to the
load in each transmission line in a three-phase system. The line
voltage 
is the voltage between each pair of lines, excluding the
neutral line if it exists. The phase current 
is the current ﬂowing
through each phase in a three-phase load. The phase voltage 
is
the voltage of each phase. For a wye-connected load,
For a delta-connected load,
5. The total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase system is
constant and equal to the average power.
6. The total complex power absorbed by a balanced three-phase 
Y-connected or 
-connected load is
where 
is the angle of the load impedances.
7. An unbalanced three-phase system can be analyzed using nodal or
mesh analysis.
8. PSpice is used to analyze three-phase circuits in the same way as
it is used for analyzing single-phase circuits.
9. The total real power is measured in three-phase systems using
either the three-wattmeter method or the two-wattmeter method.
10. Residential wiring uses a 120/240-V, single-phase, three-wire system.

Career in Electromagnetics
Electromagnetics is the branch of electrical engineering (or physics)
that deals with the analysis and application of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. In electromagnetics, electric circuit analysis is applied at low
frequencies.
The principles of electromagnetics (EM) are applied in various allied
disciplines, such as electric machines, electromechanical energy conver-
sion, radar meteorology, remote sensing, satellite communications, bio-
electromagnetics, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, plasmas,
and ﬁber optics. EM devices include electric motors and generators, trans-
formers, electromagnets, magnetic levitation, antennas, radars, microwave
ovens, microwave dishes, superconductors, and electrocardiograms. The
design of these devices requires a thorough knowledge of the laws and
principles of EM.
EM is regarded as one of the more difﬁcult disciplines in electri-
cal engineering. One reason is that EM phenomena are rather abstract.
But if one enjoys working with mathematics and can visualize the
invisible, one should consider being a specialist in EM, since few elec-
trical engineers specialize in this area. Electrical engineers who special-
ize in EM are needed in microwave industries, radio/TV broadcasting
stations, electromagnetic research laboratories, and several communi-
cations industries.

Magnetically Coupled Circuits
Introduction
The circuits we have considered so far may be regarded as conduc-
tively coupled, because one loop affects the neighboring loop through
current conduction. When two loops with or without contacts between
them affect each other through the magnetic ﬁeld generated by one of
them, they are said to be magnetically coupled.
The transformer is an electrical device designed on the basis of the
concept of magnetic coupling. It uses magnetically coupled coils to
transfer energy from one circuit to another. Transformers are key cir-
cuit elements. They are used in power systems for stepping up or step-
ping down ac voltages or currents. They are used in electronic circuits
such as radio and television receivers for such purposes as impedance
matching, isolating one part of a circuit from another, and again for
stepping up or down ac voltages and currents.
We will begin with the concept of mutual inductance and intro-
duce the dot convention used for determining the voltage polarities of
inductively coupled components. Based on the notion of mutual induc-
tance, we then introduce the circuit element known as the transformer.
We will consider the linear transformer, the ideal transformer, the ideal
autotransformer, and the three-phase transformer. Finally, among their
important applications, we look at transformers as isolating and match-
ing devices and their use in power distribution.
Mutual Inductance
When two inductors (or coils) are in a close proximity to each other,
the magnetic ﬂux caused by current in one coil links with the other
coil, thereby inducing voltage in the latter. This phenomenon is known
as mutual inductance.
Let us ﬁrst consider a single inductor, a coil with N turns. When
current i ﬂows through the coil, a magnetic ﬂux 
is produced around
it (Fig. 13.1). According to Faraday’s law, the voltage 
induced in the

James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), a graduate in mathematics from
Cambridge University, in 1865 wrote a most remarkable paper in which
he mathematically uniﬁed the laws of Faraday and Ampere. This rela-
tionship between the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld served as the basis
for what was later called electromagnetic ﬁelds and waves, a major
ﬁeld of study in electrical engineering. The Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) uses a graphical representation of this
principle in its logo, in which a straight arrow represents current and
a curved arrow represents the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This relationship
is commonly known as the right-hand rule. Maxwell was a very active
theoretician and scientist. He is best known for the “Maxwell equa-
tions.” The maxwell, a unit of magnetic ﬂux, was named after him.

coil is proportional to the number of turns N and the time rate of change
of the magnetic ﬂux ; that is,
(13.1)
But the ﬂux 
is produced by current i so that any change in 
is
caused by a change in the current. Hence, Eq. (13.1) can be written as
(13.2)
or
(13.3)
which is the voltage-current relationship for the inductor. From Eqs. (13.2)
and (13.3), the inductance L of the inductor is thus given by
(13.4)
This inductance is commonly called self-inductance, because it relates
the voltage induced in a coil by a time-varying current in the same coil.
Now consider two coils with self-inductances 
and 
that are
in close proximity with each other (Fig. 13.2). Coil 1 has 
turns,
while coil 2 has 
turns. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the
second inductor carries no current. The magnetic ﬂux 
emanating
from coil 1 has two components: One component 
links only coil 1,
and another component 
links both coils. Hence,
(13.5)
Although the two coils are physically separated, they are said to be
magnetically coupled. Since the entire ﬂux 
links coil 1, the voltage
induced in coil 1 is
(13.6)
Only ﬂux 
links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is
(13.7)
Again, as the ﬂuxes are caused by the current 
ﬂowing in coil 1,
Eq. (13.6) can be written as
(13.8)
where 
is the self-inductance of coil 1. Similarly,
Eq. (13.7) can be written as
(13.9)

is known as the mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1.
Subscript 21 indicates that the inductance 
relates the voltage
induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1. Thus, the open-circuit mutual
voltage (or induced voltage) across coil 2 is
(13.11)
Suppose we now let current 
ﬂow in coil 2, while coil 1 carries
no current (Fig. 13.3). The magnetic ﬂux 
emanating from coil 2
comprises ﬂux 
that links only coil 2 and ﬂux 
that links both
coils. Hence,
(13.12)
The entire ﬂux 
links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is
(13.13)
where 
is the self-inductance of coil 2. Since only ﬂux
links coil 1, the voltage induced in coil 1 is
(13.14)
where
(13.15)
which is the mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to coil 2. Thus,
the open-circuit mutual voltage across coil 1 is
(13.16)
We will see in the next section that 
and 
are equal; that is,
(13.17)
and we refer to M as the mutual inductance between the two coils. Like
self-inductance L, mutual inductance M is measured in henrys (H).
Keep in mind that mutual coupling only exists when the inductors or
coils are in close proximity, and the circuits are driven by time-varying
sources. We recall that inductors act like short circuits to dc.
From the two cases in Figs. 13.2 and 13.3, we conclude that mutual
inductance results if a voltage is induced by a time-varying current in
another circuit. It is the property of an inductor to produce a voltage
in reaction to a time-varying current in another inductor near it. Thus,

Mutual inductance is the ability of one inductor to induce a voltage
across a neighboring inductor, measured in henrys (H).

Mutual Inductance
559
Although mutual inductance M is always a positive quantity, the
mutual voltage 
may be negative or positive, just like the self-
induced voltage 
However, unlike the self-induced 
whose polarity is determined by the reference direction of the current
and the reference polarity of the voltage (according to the passive sign
convention), the polarity of mutual voltage 
is not easy to deter-
mine, because four terminals are involved. The choice of the correct
polarity for 
is made by examining the orientation or particu-
lar way in which both coils are physically wound and applying Lenz’s
law in conjunction with the right-hand rule. Since it is inconvenient to
show the construction details of coils on a circuit schematic, we apply
the dot convention in circuit analysis. By this convention, a dot is
placed in the circuit at one end of each of the two magnetically cou-
pled coils to indicate the direction of the magnetic ﬂux if current enters
that dotted terminal of the coil. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.4. Given
a circuit, the dots are already placed beside the coils so that we need
not bother about how to place them. The dots are used along with the
dot convention to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage. The dot
convention is stated as follows:
M didt
M didt
L didt,
L didt.
M didt
If a current enters the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity
of the mutual voltage in the second coil is positive at the dotted
terminal of the second coil.

Alternatively,
If a current leaves the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polar-
ity of the mutual voltage in the second coil is negative at the dotted
terminal of the second coil.
Thus, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage depends on the ref-
erence direction of the inducing current and the dots on the coupled
coils. Application of the dot convention is illustrated in the four pairs
of mutually coupled coils in Fig. 13.5. For the coupled coils in 
Fig. 13.5(a), the sign of the mutual voltage 
is determined by the ref-
erence polarity for 
and the direction of . Since 
enters the dotted
terminal of coil 1 and 
is positive at the dotted terminal of coil 2, the
mutual voltage is 
. For the coils in Fig. 13.5(b), the current
enters the dotted terminal of coil 1 and 
is negative at the dotted
terminal of coil 2. Hence, the mutual voltage is 
. The same
reasoning applies to the coils in Fig. 13.5(c) and 13.5(d).

For the coils in Fig. 13.6(b),
(13.19)
Now that we know how to determine the polarity of the mutual
voltage, we are prepared to analyze circuits involving mutual induc-
tance. As the ﬁrst example, consider the circuit in Fig.  13.7(a). Apply-
ing KVL to coil 1 gives
(13.20a)
For coil 2, KVL gives
(13.20b)
We can write Eq. (13.20) in the frequency domain as
(13.21a)
(13.21b)
As a second example, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.7(b). We analyze
this in the frequency domain. Applying KVL to coil 1, we get
(13.22a)
For coil 2, KVL yields
(13.22b)
Equations (13.21) and (13.22) are solved in the usual manner to deter-
mine the currents.
One of the most important things in making sure one solves prob-
lems accurately is to be able to check each step during the solution
process and to make sure assumptions can be veriﬁed. Too often, solv-
ing mutually coupled circuits requires the problem solver to track two
or more steps made at once regarding the sign and values of the mutu-
ally induced voltages.

Experience has shown that if we break the problem into steps of
solving for the value and the sign into separate steps, the decisions
made are easier to track. We suggest that model (Figure 13.8 (b)) be
used when analyzing circuits containing a mutually coupled circuit
shown in Figure 13.8(a):
Notice that we have not included the signs in the model. The rea-
son for that is that we ﬁrst determine the value of the induced voltages
and then we determine the appropriate signs. Clearly, I1 induces a volt-
age within the second coil represented by the value jI1 and I2 induces
a voltage of jI2 in the ﬁrst coil. Once we have the values we next use
both circuits to ﬁnd the correct signs for the dependent sources as
shown in Figure 13.8(c).
Since I1 enters L1 at the dotted end, it induces a voltage in L2 that
tries to force a current out of the dotted end of L2 which means that
the source must have a plus on top and a minus on the bottom as shown
in Figure 13.8(c). I2 leaves the dotted end of L2 which means that it
induces a voltage in L1 which tries to force a current into the dotted
end of L1 requiring a dependent source that has a plus on the bottom
and a minus on top as shown in Figure 13.8(c). Now all we have to
do is to analyze a circuit with two dependent sources. This process
allows you to check each of your assumptions.
At this introductory level we are not concerned with the determina-
tion of the mutual inductances of the coils and their dot placements. Like
R, L, and C, calculation of M would involve applying the theory of elec-
tromagnetics to the actual physical properties of the coils. In this text, we
assume that the mutual inductance and the placement of the dots are the
“givens’’ of the circuit problem, like the circuit components R, L, and C.

Solution:
The key to analyzing a magnetically coupled circuit is knowing
the polarity of the mutual voltage. We need to apply the dot rule. In
Fig. 13.11, suppose coil 1 is the one whose reactance is 
and coil
2 is the one whose reactance is 
To ﬁgure out the polarity of the
mutual voltage in coil 1 due to current 
we observe that 
leaves the
dotted terminal of coil 2. Since we are applying KVL in the clockwise
direction, it implies that the mutual voltage is negative, that is, j2I2.

Alternatively, it might be best to ﬁgure out the mutual voltage by
redrawing the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12,
where it becomes clear that the mutual voltage is 
.
Thus, for mesh 1 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives
or
(13.2.1)
Similarly, to ﬁgure out the mutual voltage in coil 2 due to current 
,
consider the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12.
Applying the dot convention gives the mutual voltage as 
Also, current 
sees the two coupled coils in series in Fig. 13.11; since
it leaves the dotted terminals in both coils, Eq. (13.18) applies.
Therefore, for mesh 2 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives
or
(13.2.2)
Putting Eqs. (13.2.1) and (13.2.2) in matrix form, we get
The determinants are
Thus, we obtain the mesh currents as

Energy in a Coupled Circuit
In Chapter 6, we saw that the energy stored in an inductor is given by
(13.23)
We now want to determine the energy stored in magnetically coupled
coils.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 13.14. We assume that currents 
and 
are zero initially, so that the energy stored in the coils is zero. If we let
increase from zero to 
while maintaining 
, the power in coil 1 is
(13.24)
and the energy stored in the circuit is
(13.25)
If we now maintain 
and increase 
from zero to 
the mutual
voltage induced in coil 1 is 
while the mutual voltage induced
in coil 2 is zero, since 
does not change. The power in the coils is now
(13.26)
and the energy stored in the circuit is
(13.27)
The total energy stored in the coils when both 
and 
have reached
constant values is
(13.28)
If we reverse the order by which the currents reach their ﬁnal values,
that is, if we ﬁrst increase 
from zero to 
and later increase 
from
zero to 
the total energy stored in the coils is
(13.29)
Since the total energy stored should be the same regardless of how we
reach the ﬁnal conditions, comparing Eqs. (13.28) and (13.29) leads us
to conclude that
(13.30a)
and
(13.30b)
This equation was derived based on the assumption that the coil
currents both entered the dotted terminals. If one current enters one

dotted terminal while the other current leaves the other dotted termi-
nal, the mutual voltage is negative, so that the mutual energy 
is
also negative. In that case,
(13.31)
Also, since 
and 
are arbitrary values, they may be replaced by 
and
which gives the instantaneous energy stored in the circuit the general
expression
(13.32)
The positive sign is selected for the mutual term if both currents enter
or leave the dotted terminals of the coils; the negative sign is selected
otherwise.
We will now establish an upper limit for the mutual inductance M.
The energy stored in the circuit cannot be negative because the circuit
is passive. This means that the quantity 
must be greater than or equal to zero:
(13.33)
To complete the square, we both add and subtract the term 
on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.33) and obtain
(13.34)
The squared term is never negative; at its least it is zero. Therefore,
the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.34) must be greater
than zero; that is,
or
(13.35)
Thus, the mutual inductance cannot be greater than the geometric mean
of the self-inductances of the coils. The extent to which the mutual
inductance M approaches the upper limit is speciﬁed by the coefﬁcient
of coupling k, given by
(13.36)
or
(13.37)
where 
or equivalently 
The coupling coef-
ﬁcient is the fraction of the total ﬂux emanating from one coil that links
the other coil. For example, in Fig. 13.2,

formers used in radio frequency circuits are loosely coupled, whereas
iron-core transformers used in power systems are tightly coupled. The

Linear Transformers
Here we introduce the transformer as a new circuit element. A trans-
former is a magnetic device that takes advantage of the phenomenon
of mutual inductance.

Chapter 13
Magnetically Coupled Circuits
A transformer is generally a four-terminal device comprising two (or
more) magnetically coupled coils.
As shown in Fig. 13.19, the coil that is directly connected to the volt-
age source is called the primary winding. The coil connected to the
load is called the secondary winding. The resistances 
and 
are
included to account for the losses (power dissipation) in the coils. The
transformer is said to be linear if the coils are wound on a magneti-
cally linear material—a material for which the magnetic permeability
is constant. Such materials include air, plastic, Bakelite, and wood. In
fact, most materials are magnetically linear. Linear transformers are
sometimes called air-core transformers, although not all of them are
necessarily air-core. They are used in radio and TV sets. Figure 13.20
portrays different types of transformers.

We would like to obtain the input impedance 
as seen from the
source, because 
governs the behavior of the primary circuit. Apply-
ing KVL to the two meshes in Fig. 13.19 gives
(13.40a)
(13.40b)
In Eq. (13.40b), we express 
in terms of 
and substitute it into
Eq. (13.40a). We get the input impedance as
(13.41)
Notice that the input impedance comprises two terms. The ﬁrst term,
(
), is the primary impedance. The second term is due to the
coupling between the primary and secondary windings. It is as though
this impedance is reﬂected to the primary. Thus, it is known as the
reﬂected impedance
and
(13.42)
It should be noted that the result in Eq. (13.41) or (13.42) is not
affected by the location of the dots on the transformer, because the
same result is produced when M is replaced by 
The little bit of experience gained in Sections 13.2 and 13.3 in ana-
lyzing magnetically coupled circuits is enough to convince anyone that
analyzing these circuits is not as easy as circuits in previous chapters.
For this reason, it is sometimes convenient to replace a magnetically
coupled circuit by an equivalent circuit with no magnetic coupling. We
want to replace the linear transformer in Fig. 13.21 by an equivalent T
or 
circuit, a circuit that would have no mutual inductance.
The voltage-current relationships for the primary and secondary
coils give the matrix equation
(13.43)
By matrix inversion, this can be written as
(13.44)
Our goal is to match Eqs. (13.43) and (13.44) with the corresponding
equations for the T and 
networks.
For the T (or Y) network of Fig. 13.22, mesh analysis provides the
terminal equations as

If the circuits in Figs. 13.21 and 13.22 are equivalents, Eqs. (13.43)

coupled. Also note that changing the locations of the dots in Fig. 13.21
can cause M to become

value of M is physically unrealizable but the equivalent model is still
mathematically valid.

Notice that the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is the same as that in Fig. 13.10
except that the reference direction for current 
has been reversed, just
to make the reference directions for the currents for the magnetically
coupled coils conform with those in Fig. 13.21.
We need to replace the magnetically coupled coils with the T-
equivalent circuit. The relevant portion of the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is
shown in Fig. 13.28(a). Comparing Fig. 13.28(a) with Fig. 13.21 shows
that there are two differences. First, due to the current reference
directions and voltage polarities, we need to replace M by 
to make
Fig. 13.28(a) conform with Fig. 13.21. Second, the circuit in Fig. 13.21
is in the time-domain, whereas the circuit in Fig. 13.28(a) is in
the frequency-domain. The difference is the factor

not speciﬁed, we can assume 
or any other value; it really
does not matter. With these two differences in mind,
Thus, the T-equivalent circuit for the coupled coils is as shown in
Fig. 13.28(b).
Inserting the T-equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.28(b) to replace the two
coils in Fig. 13.27 gives the equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.29, which can be

Ideal Transformers
An ideal transformer is one with perfect coupling (
). It consists
of two (or more) coils with a large number of turns wound on a com-
mon core of high permeability. Because of this high permeability of
the core, the ﬂux links all the turns of both coils, thereby resulting in
a perfect coupling.
To see how an ideal transformer is the limiting case of two coupled
inductors where the inductances approach inﬁnity and the coupling is per-
fect, let us reexamine the circuit in Fig. 13.14. In the frequency domain,

An ideal transformer is a unity-coupled, lossless transformer in which
the primary and secondary coils have inﬁnite self-inductances.
Iron-core transformers are close approximations to ideal transformers.
These are used in power systems and electronics.
Figure 13.30(a) shows a typical ideal transformer; the circuit sym-
bol is in Fig. 13.30(b). The vertical lines between the coils indicate an
iron core as distinct from the air core used in linear transformers. The
primary winding has 
turns; the secondary winding has 
turns.
When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the primary winding as
shown in Fig. 13.31, the same magnetic ﬂux 
goes through both
windings. According to Faraday’s law, the voltage across the primary
winding is
(13.50a)
while that across the secondary winding is
(13.50b)
Dividing Eq. (13.50b) by Eq. (13.50a), we get
(13.51)
where n is, again, the turns ratio or transformation ratio. We can use
the phasor voltages 
and 
rather than the instantaneous values 
and

For the reason of power conservation, the energy supplied to the pri-

A step-down transformer is one whose secondary voltage is less than
its primary voltage.
A step-up transformer is one whose secondary voltage is greater than
its primary voltage.
The ratings of transformers are usually speciﬁed as 
A trans-
former with rating 2400/120 V should have 2400 V on the primary and
120 in the secondary (i.e., a step-down transformer). Keep in mind that
the voltage ratings are in rms.
Power companies often generate at some convenient voltage and
use a step-up transformer to increase the voltage so that the power can
be transmitted at very high voltage and low current over transmission
lines, resulting in signiﬁcant cost savings. Near residential consumer
premises, step-down transformers are used to bring the voltage down
to 120 V. Section 13.9.3 will elaborate on this.
It is important that we know how to get the proper polarity of the
voltages and the direction of the currents for the transformer in Fig. 13.31.
If the polarity of 
or 
or the direction of 
or 
is changed, n in
Eqs. (13.51) to (13.55) may need to be replaced by

ple rules to follow are:

minals, use

polarities and current directions in an

Notice that an ideal transformer reﬂects
an impedance as the square of the
turns ratio.

The complex power in the primary winding is
(13.58)
showing that the complex power supplied to the primary is delivered
to the secondary without loss. The transformer absorbs no power. Of
course, we should expect this, since the ideal transformer is lossless.
The input impedance as seen by the source in Fig. 13.31 is found from
Eqs. (13.56) and (13.57) as
(13.59)
It is evident from Fig. 13.31 that

The input impedance is also called the reﬂected impedance, since it
appears as if the load impedance is reﬂected to the primary side. This
ability of the transformer to transform a given impedance into another
impedance provides us a means of impedance matching to ensure
maximum power transfer. The idea of impedance matching is very use-
ful in practice and will be discussed more in Section 13.9.2.
In analyzing a circuit containing an ideal transformer, it is com-
mon practice to eliminate the transformer by reﬂecting impedances
and sources from one side of the transformer to the other. In the cir-
cuit of Fig. 13.33, suppose we want to reﬂect the secondary side of
the circuit to the primary side. We ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent of
the circuit to the right of the terminals

The general rule for eliminating the transformer and reﬂecting the sec-
ondary circuit to the primary side is: Divide the secondary impedance
by n2, divide the secondary voltage by n, and multiply the secondary
current by n.
We can also reﬂect the primary side of the circuit in Fig. 13.33 to
the secondary side. Figure 13.36 shows the equivalent circuit.
The rule for eliminating the transformer and reflecting the primary
circuit to the secondary side is: Multiply the primary impedance by
n2, multiply the primary voltage by n, and divide the primary current
by n.
According to Eq. (13.58), the power remains the same, whether calcu-
lated on the primary or the secondary side. But realize that this reﬂec-
tion approach only applies if there are no external connections between
the primary and secondary windings. When we have external connec-
tions between the primary and secondary windings, we simply use reg-
ular mesh and nodal analysis. Examples of circuits where there are
external connections between the primary and secondary windings are
in Figs. 13.39 and 13.40. Also note that if the locations of the dots in
Fig. 13.33 are changed, we might have to replace n by 
in order to
obey the dot rule, illustrated in Fig. 13.32.

Ideal Autotransformers
Unlike the conventional two-winding transformer we have considered
so far, an autotransformer has a single continuous winding with a con-
nection point called a tap between the primary and secondary sides.
The tap is often adjustable so as to provide the desired turns ratio for
stepping up or stepping down the voltage. This way, a variable voltage
is provided to the load connected to the autotransformer.
13.6
13.6
Ideal Autotransformers
581
An autotransformer is a transformer in which both the primary and the
secondary are in a single winding.
Figure 13.41 shows a typical autotransformer. As shown in
Fig. 13.42, the autotransformer can operate in the step-down or step-
up mode. The autotransformer is a type of power transformer. Its
major advantage over the two-winding transformer is its ability to
transfer larger apparent power. Example 13.10 will demonstrate this.
Another advantage is that an autotransformer is smaller and lighter
than an equivalent two-winding transformer. However, since both the
primary and secondary windings are one winding, electrical isolation
(no direct electrical connection) is lost. (We will see how the property
of electrical isolation in the conventional transformer is practically
employed in Section 13.9.1.) The lack of electrical isolation between
the primary and secondary windings is a major disadvantage of the
autotransformer.
Some of the formulas we derived for ideal transformers apply to
ideal autotransformers as well. For the step-down autotransformer cir-
cuit of Fig. 13.42(a), Eq. (13.52) gives
(13.63)
As an ideal autotransformer, there are no losses, so the complex power
remains the same in the primary and secondary windings:
(13.64)
Equation (13.64) can also be expressed as
or
(13.65)
Thus, the current relationship is

The complex power given by Eq. (13.64) also applies to the step-up
autotransformer so that Eq. (13.65) again applies. Hence, the current
relationship is
(13.68)
A major difference between conventional transformers and auto-
transformers is that the primary and secondary sides of the autotrans-
former are not only coupled magnetically but also coupled conductively.
The autotransformer can be used in place of a conventional transformer
when electrical isolation is not required.

Although the primary and secondary windings of the autotransformer
are together as a continuous winding, they are separated in Fig. 13.43(b)
for clarity. We note that the current and voltage of each winding of the
autotransformer in Fig. 13.43(b) are the same as those for the two-
winding transformer in Fig. 13.43(a). This is the basis of comparing
their power ratings.

Three-Phase Transformers
To meet the demand for three-phase power transmission, transformer
connections compatible with three-phase operations are needed. We can
achieve the transformer connections in two ways: by connecting three
single-phase transformers, thereby forming a so-called transformer
bank, or by using a special three-phase transformer. For the same kVA
rating, a three-phase transformer is always smaller and cheaper than
three single-phase transformers. When single-phase transformers are
used, one must ensure that they have the same turns ratio n to achieve
a balanced three-phase system. There are four standard ways of con-
necting three single-phase transformers or a three-phase transformer for
three-phase operations: Y-Y, 
and 
For any of the four connections, the total apparent power 
real
power 
and reactive power 
are obtained as 
(13.69a)
(13.69b)
(13.69c)
where 
and 
are, respectively, equal to the line voltage 
and the
line current 
for the primary side, or the line voltage 
and the
line current 
for the secondary side. Notice From Eq. (13.69) that
for each of the four connections, 
since power must
be conserved in an ideal transformer.
For the Y-Y connection (Fig. 13.46), the line voltage 
at the pri-
mary side, the line voltage 
on the secondary side, the line current 
on the primary side, and the line current 
on the secondary side are
related to the transformer per phase turns ratio n according to Eqs. (13.52)
and (13.55) as
(13.70a)
(13.70b)
For the

connection (Fig. 13.47), Eq. (13.70) also applies for
the line voltages and line currents. This connection is unique in the

Practice Problem 13.12
PSpice Analysis of Magnetically
Coupled Circuits
PSpice analyzes magnetically coupled circuits just like inductor circuits
except that the dot convention must be followed. In PSpice Schematic,
the dot (not shown) is always next to pin 1, which is the left-hand ter-
minal of the inductor when the inductor with part name L is placed
(horizontally) without rotation on a schematic. Thus, the dot or pin 1
will be at the bottom after one 
counterclockwise rotation, since
rotation is always about pin 1. Once the magnetically coupled induc-
tors are arranged with the dot convention in mind and their value
90
13.8

attributes are set in henries, we use the coupling symbol K_LINEAR
to deﬁne the coupling. For each pair of coupled inductors, take the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Select Draw/Get New Part and type K_LINEAR.
2. Hit <enter> or click OK and place the K_LINEAR symbol on the
schematic, as shown in Fig. 13.51. (Notice that K_LINEAR is not
a component and therefore has no pins.)
3. DCLICKL on COUPLING and set the value of the coupling coef-
ﬁcient k.
4. DCLICKL on the boxed K (the coupling symbol) and enter the
reference designator names for the coupled inductors as values
of Li, 
For example, if inductors L20 and L23
are coupled, we set 
and 
L1 and at least
one other Li must be assigned values; other Li’s may be left
blank.
In step 4, up to six coupled inductors with equal coupling can be
speciﬁed.
For the air-core transformer, the partname is XFRM_LINEAR.
It can be inserted in a circuit by selecting Draw/Get Part Name and
then typing in the part name or by selecting the part name from the
analog.slb library. As shown typically in Fig. 13.52(a), the main
attributes of the linear transformer are the coupling coefﬁcient k and
the inductance values L1 and L2 in henries. If the mutual inductance
M is specified, its value must be used along with L1 and L2 to
calculate k. Keep in mind that the value of k should lie between 0
and 1.
For the ideal transformer, the part name is XFRM NONLINEAR
and is located in the breakout.slb library. Select it by clicking
Draw/Get Part Name and then typing in the part name. Its attributes
are the coupling coefﬁcient and the numbers of turns associated with
L1 and L2, as illustrated typically in Fig. 13.52(b). The value of the
coefﬁcient of mutual coupling

as follows:
The operating frequency f is obtained from Fig. 13.53 as 
The schematic of the circuit is portrayed in Fig. 13.54. Notice how
the dot convention is adhered to. For L2, the dot (not shown) is on pin
1 (the left-hand terminal) and is therefore placed without rotation. For
L1, in order for the dot to be on the right-hand side of the inductor,
the inductor must be rotated through 
For L3, the inductor must be
rotated through 
so that the dot will be at the bottom. Note that the
2-H inductor 
is not coupled. To handle the three coupled inductors,

Applications
Transformers are the largest, the heaviest, and often the costliest of cir-
cuit components. Nevertheless, they are indispensable passive devices
in electric circuits. They are among the most efﬁcient machines, 95 per-
cent efﬁciency being common and 99 percent being achievable. They
have numerous applications. For example, transformers are used:
• To step up or step down voltage and current, making them useful
for power transmission and distribution.
• To isolate one portion of a circuit from another (i.e., to transfer
power without any electrical connection).
• As an impedance-matching device for maximum power transfer.
• In frequency-selective circuits whose operation depends on the
response of inductances.
13.9

Because of these diverse uses, there are many special designs for
transformers (only some of which are discussed in this chapter): volt-
age transformers, current transformers, power transformers, distribution
transformers, impedance-matching transformers, audio transformers,
single-phase transformers, three-phase transformers, rectiﬁer trans-
formers, inverter transformers, and more. In this section, we consider
three important applications: transformer as an isolation device, trans-
former as a matching device, and power distribution system. 
13.9.1
Transformer as an Isolation Device
Electrical isolation is said to exist between two devices when there is
no physical connection between them. In a transformer, energy is trans-
ferred by magnetic coupling, without electrical connection between the
primary circuit and secondary circuit. We now consider three simple
practical examples of how we take advantage of this property. 
First, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.59. A rectiﬁer is an electronic
circuit that converts an ac supply to a dc supply. A transformer is often
used to couple the ac supply to the rectiﬁer. The transformer serves two
purposes. First, it steps up or steps down the voltage. Second, it provides
electrical isolation between the ac power supply and the rectiﬁer, thereby
reducing the risk of shock hazard in handling the electronic device. 
As a second example, a transformer is often used to couple two
stages of an ampliﬁer, to prevent any dc voltage in one stage from
affecting the dc bias of the next stage. Biasing is the application of a
dc voltage to a transistor ampliﬁer or any other electronic device in
order to produce a desired mode of operation. Each ampliﬁer stage is
biased separately to operate in a particular mode; the desired mode of
operation will be compromised without a transformer providing dc iso-
lation. As shown in Fig. 13.60, only the ac signal is coupled through
the transformer from one stage to the next. We recall that magnetic
coupling does not exist with a dc voltage source. Transformers are used
in radio and TV receivers to couple stages of high-frequency ampli-
ﬁers. When the sole purpose of a transformer is to provide isolation,
its turns ratio n is made unity. Thus, an isolation transformer has 
As a third example, consider measuring the voltage across 13.2-kV
lines. It is obviously not safe to connect a voltmeter directly to
such high-voltage lines. A transformer can be used both to electrically
isolate the line power from the voltmeter and to step down the voltage
to a safe level, as shown in Fig. 13.61. Once the voltmeter is used to

Transformer as a Matching Device
We recall that for maximum power transfer, the load resistance 
must be matched with the source resistance 
In most cases, the
two resistances are not matched; both are ﬁxed and cannot be altered.
However, an iron-core transformer can be used to match the load
resistance to the source resistance. This is called impedance match-
ing. For example, to connect a loudspeaker to an audio power ampli-
ﬁer requires a transformer, because the speaker’s resistance is only
a few ohms while the internal resistance of the ampliﬁer is several
thousand ohms.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 13.64. We recall from Eq. (13.60)
that the ideal transformer reﬂects its load back to the primary with a

The ideal transformer in Fig. 13.65 is used to match the ampliﬁer circuit
to the loudspeaker to achieve maximum power transfer. The Thevenin
(or output) impedance of the ampliﬁer is 
and the internal imped-
ance of the speaker is 
Determine the required turns ratio.
Solution:
We replace the ampliﬁer circuit with the Thevenin equivalent and
reﬂect the impedance 
of the speaker to the primary side of
the ideal transformer. Figure 13.66 shows the result. For maximum
power transfer,
Thus, the turns ratio is 
Using 
we can show that indeed the power delivered to the
speaker is much larger than without the ideal transformer. Without
the ideal transformer, the ampliﬁer is directly connected to the speaker.
The power delivered to the speaker is

13.9.3
Power Distribution
A power system basically consists of three components: generation,
transmission, and distribution. The local electric company operates a
plant that generates several hundreds of megavolt-amperes (MVA), typ-
ically at about 18 kV. As Fig. 13.67 illustrates, three-phase step-up
transformers are used to feed the generated power to the transmission
line. Why do we need the transformer? Suppose we need to transmit
100,000 VA over a distance of 50 km. Since 
using a line volt-
age of 1,000 V implies that the transmission line must carry 100 A and
this requires a transmission line of a large diameter. If, on the other
hand, we use a line voltage of 10,000 V, the current is only 10 A. The
smaller current reduces the required conductor size, producing consid-
erable savings as well as minimizing transmission line 
losses. To
minimize losses requires a step-up transformer. Without the trans-
former, the majority of the power generated would be lost on the trans-
mission line. The ability of the transformer to step up or step down
voltage and distribute power economically is one of the major reasons
for generating ac rather than dc. Thus, for a given power, the larger the
voltage, the better. Today, 1 MV is the largest voltage in use; the level
may increase as a result of research and experiments.

Beyond the generation plant, the power is transmitted for hundreds
of miles through an electric network called the power grid. The three-
phase power in the power grid is conveyed by transmission lines hung
overhead from steel towers which come in a variety of sizes and shapes.
The (aluminum-conductor, steel-reinforced) lines typically have over-
all diameters up to about 40 mm and can carry current of up to 1,380 A.
At the substations, distribution transformers are used to step down
the voltage. The step-down process is usually carried out in stages.
Power may be distributed throughout a locality by means of either
overhead or underground cables. The substations distribute the power
to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. At the receiving
end, a residential customer is eventually supplied with 120/240 V, while
industrial or commercial customers are fed with higher voltages such
One may ask, How would increasing
the voltage not increase the current,
thereby increasing I2R losses? Keep in
mind that I  V R, where V is the po-
tential difference between the sending
and receiving ends of the line. The
voltage that is stepped up is the send-
ing end voltage V, not V . If the receiv-
ing end is VR, then V  V  VR. Since
V and VR are close to each other, V is
small even when V is stepped up.

as 460/208 V. Residential customers are usually supplied by distribu-
tion transformers often mounted on the poles of the electric utility com-
pany. When direct current is needed, the alternating current is converted
to dc electronically.

major high-voltage DC transmission segments.
There are a lot of good reasons for doing this but we
will not go into them here. To go from the AC to DC,
power electronics are used. We start with three-phase
AC and then rectify it (using a full-wave rectiﬁer). It
was found that using a delta to wye and delta
combination connected secondary would give us a
much smaller ripple after the full-wave rectiﬁer.
How is this accomplished? Remember that these are
real devices and are wound on common cores. 
Hint: Use Figs. 13.47 and 13.49, and the fact that
each coil of the wye connected secondary and each
coil of the delta connected secondary are wound
around the same core of each coil of the delta con-
nected primary so the voltage of each of the
corresponding coils are in phase. When the output
leads of both secondaries are connected through full-
wave rectiﬁers with the same load, you will see that
the ripple is now greatly reduced. Please consult the
instructor for more help if necessary.

Career in Control Systems
Control systems are another area of electrical engineering where circuit
analysis is used. A control system is designed to regulate the behavior
of one or more variables in some desired manner. Control systems play
major roles in our everyday life. Household appliances such as heat-
ing and air-conditioning systems, switch-controlled thermostats, wash-
ers and dryers, cruise controllers in automobiles, elevators, trafﬁc
lights, manufacturing plants, navigation systems—all utilize control
systems. In the aerospace ﬁeld, precision guidance of space probes, the
wide range of operational modes of the space shuttle, and the ability
to maneuver space vehicles remotely from earth all require knowledge
of control systems. In the manufacturing sector, repetitive production
line operations are increasingly performed by robots, which are pro-
grammable control systems designed to operate for many hours with-
out fatigue.
Control engineering integrates circuit theory and communication
theory. It is not limited to any speciﬁc engineering discipline but may
involve environmental, chemical, aeronautical, mechanical, civil, and
electrical engineering. For example, a typical task for a control system
engineer might be to design a speed regulator for a disk drive head.
A thorough understanding of control systems techniques is essen-
tial to the electrical engineer and is of great value for designing con-
trol systems to perform the desired task.

Introduction
In our sinusoidal circuit analysis, we have learned how to ﬁnd volt-
ages and currents in a circuit with a constant frequency source. If
we let the amplitude of the sinusoidal source remain constant and
vary the frequency, we obtain the circuit’s frequency response. The
frequency response may be regarded as a complete description of
the sinusoidal steady-state behavior of a circuit as a function of
frequency.

Chapter 14
Frequency Response
The frequency response of a circuit is the variation in its behavior with
change in signal frequency. 
The sinusoidal steady-state frequency responses of circuits are of
signiﬁcance in many applications, especially in communications and
control systems. A speciﬁc application is in electric ﬁlters that block
out or eliminate signals with unwanted frequencies and pass signals of
the desired frequencies. Filters are used in radio, TV, and telephone
systems to separate one broadcast frequency from another.
We begin this chapter by considering the frequency response of
simple circuits using their transfer functions. We then consider Bode
plots, which are the industry-standard way of presenting frequency
response. We also consider series and parallel resonant circuits and
encounter important concepts such as resonance, quality factor, cutoff
frequency, and bandwidth. We discuss different kinds of ﬁlters and net-
work scaling. In the last section, we consider one practical application
of resonant circuits and two applications of ﬁlters.
Transfer Function
The transfer function 
(also called the network function) is a
useful analytical tool for ﬁnding the frequency response of a circuit.
In fact, the frequency response of a circuit is the plot of the circuit’s
transfer function 
versus 
with 
varying from 
to
A transfer function is the frequency-dependent ratio of a forced
function to a forcing function (or of an output to an input). The idea
of a transfer function was implicit when we used the concepts of
impedance and admittance to relate voltage and current. In general,
a linear network can be represented by the block diagram shown in
Fig. 14.1.

permissible due to lack of enough let-
ters in the English language to express
all circuit variables distinctly.

assuming zero initial conditions. Since the input and output can be either
voltage or current at any place in the circuit, there are four possible trans-
fer functions:
(14.2a)
(14.2b)
(14.2c)
(14.2d)
where subscripts i and o denote input and output values. Being a complex
quantity, 
has a magnitude 
and a phase 
; that is, 
To obtain the transfer function using Eq. (14.2), we ﬁrst obtain the
frequency-domain equivalent of the circuit by replacing resistors,
inductors, and capacitors with their impedances R, 
and 
We
then use any circuit technique(s) to obtain the appropriate quantity in
Eq. (14.2). We can obtain the frequency response of the circuit by plot-
ting the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as the frequency
varies. A computer is a real time-saver for plotting the transfer function.
The transfer function 
can be expressed in terms of its numer-
ator polynomial 
and denominator polynomial 
as

where 
and 
are not necessarily the same expressions for the
input and output functions, respectively. The representation of

A zero, as a root of the numerator polynomial, is a value that results in
a zero value of the function. A pole, as a root of the denominator poly-
nomial, is a value for which the function is inﬁnite.

The Decibel Scale
It is not always easy to get a quick plot of the magnitude and phase of
the transfer function as we did above. A more systematic way of obtain-
ing the frequency response is to use Bode plots. Before we begin to
construct Bode plots, we should take care of two important issues: the
use of logarithms and decibels in expressing gain.
Since Bode plots are based on logarithms, it is important that we
keep the following properties of logarithms in mind:
1.
2.
3.
4.
In communications systems, gain is measured in bels. Historically,
the bel is used to measure the ratio of two levels of power or power
gain G; that is,
(14.4)
G  Number of bels  log10 P2
P1
log 1  0
log P n  n log P
log P1P2  log P1  log P2
log P1P2  log P1  log P2
14.3
Historical note: The bel is named after
Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of
the telephone.

The decibel (dB) provides us with a unit of less magnitude. It is 110th of
a bel and is given by
(14.5)
When 
, there is no change in power and the gain is 0 dB. If
, the gain is
(14.6)
and when 
, the gain is
(14.7)
Equations (14.6) and (14.7) show another reason why logarithms are
greatly used: The logarithm of the reciprocal of a quantity is simply
negative the logarithm of that quantity.
Alternatively, the gain G can be expressed in terms of voltage
or current ratio. To do so, consider the network shown in Fig. 14.8. If
is the input power, 
is the output (load) power, 
is the input
resistance, and 
is the load resistance, then

Frequency Response
Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922) inventor of the telephone,
was a Scottish-American scientist.
Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, a son of Alexander Melville
Bell, a well-known speech teacher. Alexander the younger also became
a speech teacher after graduating from the University of Edinburgh and
the University of London. In 1866 he became interested in transmit-
ting speech electrically. After his older brother died of tuberculosis, his
father decided to move to Canada. Alexander was asked to come to
Boston to work at the School for the Deaf. There he met Thomas A.
Watson, who became his assistant in his electromagnetic transmitter
experiment. On March 10, 1876, Alexander sent the famous ﬁrst tele-
phone message: “Watson, come here I want you.” The bel, the loga-
rithmic unit introduced in this chapter, is named in his honor.

Instead, if 
and

we obtain
(14.11)
Three things are important to note from Eqs. (14.5), (14.10), and (14.11):
1. That 
is used for power, while 
is used for voltage
or current, because of the square relationship between them
(
).
2. That the dB value is a logarithmic measurement of the ratio of one
variable to another of the same type. Therefore, it applies in
expressing the transfer function H in Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b),
which are dimensionless quantities, but not in expressing H in
Eqs. (14.2c) and (14.2d).
3. It is important to note that we only use voltage and current mag-
nitudes in Eqs. (14.10) and (14.11). Negative signs and angles will
be handled independently as we will see in Section 14.4.
With this in mind, we now apply the concepts of logarithms and deci-
bels to construct Bode plots.
Bode Plots
Obtaining the frequency response from the transfer function as we
did in Section 14.2 is an uphill task. The frequency range required in
frequency response is often so wide that it is inconvenient to use a
linear scale for the frequency axis. Also, there is a more systematic
way of locating the important features of the magnitude and phase
plots of the transfer function. For these reasons, it has become stan-
dard practice to plot the transfer function on a pair of semilogarith-
mic plots: The magnitude in decibels is plotted against the logarithm
of the frequency; on a separate plot, the phase in degrees is plotted
against the logarithm of the frequency. Such semilogarithmic plots of
the transfer function—known as Bode plots—have become the indus-
try standard.

Bode Plots

Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude (in decibels) and phase
(in degrees) of a transfer function versus frequency.
Bode plots contain the same information as the nonlogarithmic plots
discussed in the previous section, but they are much easier to construct,
as we shall see shortly.
The transfer function can be written as
(14.12)
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,

Thus, the real part of

imaginary part is the phase. In a Bode magnitude plot, the gain

values of H with the corresponding values in decibels. In a Bode phase
plot, 
is plotted in degrees versus frequency. Both magnitude and
phase plots are made on semilog graph paper.
A transfer function in the form of Eq. (14.3) may be written in terms
of factors that have real and imaginary parts. One such representation
might be

which is obtained by dividing out the poles and zeros in 
The
representation of 
as in Eq. (14.15) is called the standard form.
may include up to seven types of different factors that can appear
in various combinations in a transfer function. These are:
1. A gain K
2. A pole 
or zero 
at the origin
3. A simple pole 
or zero 
4. A
quadratic pole 
or zero 
In constructing a Bode plot, we plot each factor separately and then
add them graphically. The factors can be considered one at a time and
then combined additively because of the logarithms involved. It is this
mathematical convenience of the logarithm that makes Bode plots a
powerful engineering tool.
We will now make straight-line plots of the factors listed above.
We shall ﬁnd that these straight-line plots known as Bode plots approx-
imate the actual plots to a reasonable degree of accuracy.
Constant term:
For the gain K, the magnitude is 
and the
phase is 
both are constant with frequency. Thus, the magnitude and
phase plots of the gain are shown in Fig. 14.9. If K is negative, the
magnitude remains 
but the phase is
.
Pole/zero at the origin:
For the zero 
at the origin, the magni-
tude is 
and the phase is 
These are plotted in Fig. 14.10,
where we notice that the slope of the magnitude plot is 20 dB/decade,
while the phase is constant with frequency.
The Bode plots for the pole 
are similar except that the slope
of the magnitude plot is 
while the phase is 
In
general, for 
where N is an integer, the magnitude plot will have
a slope of 20N dB/decade, while the phase is 90N degrees.

should be added to the straight-line approximation if a high level of
accuracy is desired. However, we will use the straight-line approxima-
tion for the sake of simplicity.

The phase plot is a straight line with a slope of

at

as shown in Fig. 14.12(b). We see again
that the difference between the actual plot and the straight-line plot is due
to the damping factor. Notice that the straight-line approximations for both
magnitude and phase plots for the quadratic pole are the same as those
for a double pole, i.e. 
We should expect this because
the double pole 
equals the quadratic pole 
when 
Thus, the quadratic pole can be
treated as a double pole as far as straight-line approximation is concerned.
For the quadratic zero 
, the plots in
Fig. 14.12 are inverted because the magnitude plot has a slope of
40 dB/decade while the phase plot has a slope of 
per decade.
Table 14.3 presents a summary of Bode plots for the seven factors.
Of course, not every transfer function has all seven factors. To sketch
the Bode plots for a function 
in the form of Eq. (14.15), for exam-
ple, we ﬁrst record the corner frequencies on the semilog graph paper,
sketch the factors one at a time as discussed above, and then combine

There is another procedure for obtain-
ing Bode plots that is faster and perhaps
more efﬁcient than the one we have just
discussed. It consists in realizing that
zeros cause an increase in slope, while
poles cause a decrease. By starting with
the low-frequency asymptote of the
Bode plot, moving along the frequency
axis, and increasing or decreasing the
slope at each corner frequency, one can
sketch the Bode plot immediately from
the transfer function without the effort
of making individual plots and adding
them. This procedure can be used once
you become proﬁcient in the one
discussed here.
Digital computers have rendered
the procedure discussed here almost
obsolete. Several software packages
such as PSpice, MATLAB, Mathcad,
and Micro-Cap can be used to gener-
ate frequency response plots. We will
discuss PSpice later in the chapter.

Series Resonance
The most prominent feature of the frequency response of a circuit may
be the sharp peak (or resonant peak) exhibited in its amplitude char-
acteristic. The concept of resonance applies in several areas of science
and engineering. Resonance occurs in any system that has a complex
conjugate pair of poles; it is the cause of oscillations of stored energy
from one form to another. It is the phenomenon that allows frequency

Chapter 14
Frequency Response
Resonance is a condition in an RLC circuit in which the capacitive and
inductive reactances are equal in magnitude, thereby resulting in a
purely resistive impedance.
Resonant circuits (series or parallel) are useful for constructing ﬁlters,
as their transfer functions can be highly frequency selective. They are
used in many applications such as selecting the desired stations in radio
and TV receivers.
Consider the series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 14.21 in the fre-
quency domain. The input impedance is
(14.22)
or
(14.23)
Resonance results when the imaginary part of the transfer function is
zero, or
(14.24)
The value of 
that satisﬁes this condition is called the resonant fre-
quency
. Thus, the resonance condition is
(14.25)
or
(14.26)
Since 
,
(14.27)
Note that at resonance:
1. The impedance is purely resistive, thus, 
In other words,
the LC series combination acts like a short circuit, and the entire
voltage is across R.
2. The voltage 
and the current 
are in phase, so that the power
factor is unity.
3. The magnitude of the transfer function 
is minimum.
4. The inductor voltage and capacitor voltage can be much more
than the source voltage.

is shown in Fig. 14.22; the plot only shows the symmetry illustrated
in this graph when the frequency axis is a logarithm. The average
power dissipated by the RLC circuit is

The highest power dissipated occurs at resonance, when

(14.30)
At certain frequencies 
the dissipated power is half the
maximum value; that is,
(14.31)
Hence, 
and 
are called the half-power frequencies.
The half-power frequencies are obtained by setting Z equal to 
and writing
(14.32)
Solving for , we obtain
(14.33)
We can relate the half-power frequencies with the resonant frequency.
From Eqs. (14.26) and (14.33),

power frequencies. Notice that 
and 
are in general not symmet-
rical around the resonant frequency 
, because the frequency response
is not generally symmetrical. However, as will be explained shortly,
symmetry of the half-power frequencies around the resonant frequency
is often a reasonable approximation.
Although the height of the curve in Fig. 14.22 is determined by R,
the width of the curve depends on other factors. The width of the
response curve depends on the bandwidth B, which is deﬁned as the
difference between the two half-power frequencies,
(14.35)
This deﬁnition of bandwidth is just one of several that are commonly
used. Strictly speaking, B in Eq. (14.35) is a half-power bandwidth,
because it is the width of the frequency band between the half-power
frequencies.
The “sharpness” of the resonance in a resonant circuit is measured
quantitatively by the quality factor Q. At resonance, the reactive energy

quality factor relates the maximum or peak energy stored to the energy
dissipated in the circuit per cycle of oscillation:

It is also regarded as a measure of the energy storage property of a cir-
cuit in relation to its energy dissipation property. In the series RLC

Frequency Response
The quality factor of a resonant circuit is the ratio of its resonant
frequency to its bandwidth.
Keep in mind that Eqs. (14.33), (14.38), and (14.39) only apply to a
series RLC circuit.
As illustrated in Fig. 14.23, the higher the value of Q, the more
selective the circuit is but the smaller the bandwidth. The selectivity of
an RLC circuit is the ability of the circuit to respond to a certain fre-
quency and discriminate against all other frequencies. If the band of
frequencies to be selected or rejected is narrow, the quality factor of
the resonant circuit must be high. If the band of frequencies is wide,
the quality factor must be low.
A resonant circuit is designed to operate at or near its resonant fre-
quency. It is said to be a high-Q circuit when its quality factor is equal
to or greater than 10. For high-Q circuits 
the half-power
frequencies are, for all practical purposes, symmetrical around the res-
onant frequency and can be approximated as
(14.40)
High-Q circuits are used often in communications networks.

Parallel Resonance
The parallel RLC circuit in Fig. 14.25 is the dual of the series RLC cir-
cuit. So we will avoid needless repetition. The admittance is
(14.41)
or
(14.42)
Resonance occurs when the imaginary part of 
is zero,
(14.43)
or
(14.44)
which is the same as Eq. (14.26) for the series resonant circuit. The
voltage 
is sketched in Fig. 14.26 as a function of frequency.
Notice that at resonance, the parallel LC combination acts like an
open circuit, so that the entire current ﬂows through R. Also, the
inductor and capacitor current can be much more than the source
current at resonance.
We exploit the duality between Figs. 14.21 and 14.25 by compar-
ing Eq. (14.42) with Eq. (14.23). By replacing R, L, and C in the

Passive Filters
The concept of ﬁlters has been an integral part of the evolution of elec-
trical engineering from the beginning. Several technological achieve-
ments would not have been possible without electrical ﬁlters. Because
of this prominent role of ﬁlters, much effort has been expended on the
theory, design, and construction of ﬁlters and many articles and books
have been written on them. Our discussion in this chapter should be
considered introductory.
14.7
A ﬁlter is a circuit that is designed to pass signals with desired
frequencies and reject or attenuate others.
As a frequency-selective device, a ﬁlter can be used to limit the fre-
quency spectrum of a signal to some speciﬁed band of frequencies.
Filters are the circuits used in radio and TV receivers to allow us to
select one desired signal out of a multitude of broadcast signals in the
environment.
A ﬁlter is a passive ﬁlter if it consists of only passive elements R,
L, and C. It is said to be an active ﬁlter if it consists of active elements
(such as transistors and op amps) in addition to passive elements R, L,
and C. We consider passive ﬁlters in this section and active ﬁlters in
the next section. LC ﬁlters have been used in practical applications for
more than eight decades. LC ﬁlter technology feeds related areas such
as equalizers, impedance-matching networks, transformers, shaping
networks, power dividers, attenuators, and directional couplers, and is
continuously providing practicing engineers with opportunities to inno-
vate and experiment. Besides the LC ﬁlters we study in these sections,
there are other kinds of ﬁlters—such as digital ﬁlters, electromechanical
ﬁlters, and microwave ﬁlters—which are beyond the level of this text.

As shown in Fig. 14.30, there are four types of ﬁlters whether pas-
sive or active:
1. A lowpass ﬁlter passes low frequencies and stops high frequencies,
as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(a).
2. A highpass ﬁlter passes high frequencies and rejects low frequencies,
as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(b).
3. A bandpass ﬁlter passes frequencies within a frequency band and
blocks or attenuates frequencies outside the band, as shown ide-
ally in Fig. 14.30(c).
4. A bandstop ﬁlter passes frequencies outside a frequency band and
blocks or attenuates frequencies within the band, as shown ideally
in Fig. 14.30(d).
Table 14.5 presents a summary of the characteristics of these ﬁlters. Be
aware that the characteristics in Table 14.5 are only valid for ﬁrst- or
second-order ﬁlters—but one should not have the impression that only
these kinds of ﬁlter exist. We now consider typical circuits for realiz-
ing the ﬁlters shown in Table 14.5.

Since the bandpass ﬁlter in Fig. 14.35 is a series resonant circuit, the
half-power frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are deter-
mined as in Section 14.5. A bandpass ﬁlter can also be formed by
cascading the lowpass ﬁlter (where 
) in Fig. 14.31 with the
2  c

highpass ﬁlter (where 
) in Fig. 14.33. However, the result
would not be the same as just adding the output of the lowpass ﬁlter
to the input of the highpass ﬁlter, because one circuit loads the other
and alters the desired transfer function.
14.7.4
Bandstop Filter
A ﬁlter that prevents a band of frequencies between two designated
values 
and 
) from passing is variably known as a bandstop, band-
reject, or notch ﬁlter. A bandstop ﬁlter is formed when the output RLC

Chapter 14
Frequency Response
A bandstop ﬁlter is designed to stop or eliminate all frequencies
within a band of frequencies, 1 6  6 2.
Notice that adding the transfer functions of the bandpass and the
bandstop gives unity at any frequency for the same values of R, L, and
C. Of course, this is not true in general but true for the circuits treated
here. This is due to the fact that the characteristic of one is the inverse
of the other.
In concluding this section, we should note that:
1. From Eqs. (14.50), (14.52), (14.54), and (14.56), the maximum gain
of a passive ﬁlter is unity. To generate a gain greater than unity,
one should use an active ﬁlter as the next section shows.
2. There are other ways to get the types of ﬁlters treated in this section.
3. The ﬁlters treated here are the simple types. Many other ﬁlters
have sharper and complex frequency responses.

Active Filters
There are three major limitations to the passive ﬁlters considered in the
previous section. First, they cannot generate gain greater than 1; pas-
sive elements cannot add energy to the network. Second, they may
require bulky and expensive inductors. Third, they perform poorly at
frequencies below the audio frequency range 
Nevertheless, passive ﬁlters are useful at high frequencies.
Active ﬁlters consist of combinations of resistors, capacitors, and
op amps. They offer some advantages over passive RLC ﬁlters. First,
they are often smaller and less expensive, because they do not require
inductors. This makes feasible the integrated circuit realizations of ﬁl-
ters. Second, they can provide ampliﬁer gain in addition to providing
the same frequency response as RLC ﬁlters. Third, active ﬁlters can be
combined with buffer ampliﬁers (voltage followers) to isolate each
stage of the ﬁlter from source and load impedance effects. This isola-
tion allows designing the stages independently and then cascading them
to realize the desired transfer function. (Bode plots, being logarithmic,
may be added when transfer functions are cascaded.) However, active
ﬁlters are less reliable and less stable. The practical limit of most active
(300 Hz 6 f 6 3,000 Hz).

This way of creating a bandpass ﬁlter,
not necessarily the best, is perhaps the
easiest to understand.
ﬁlters is about 100 kHz—most active ﬁlters operate well below that
frequency.
Filters are often classiﬁed according to their order (or number of
poles) or their speciﬁc design type.
14.8.1
First-Order Lowpass Filter
One type of ﬁrst-order ﬁlter is shown in Fig. 14.41. The components
selected for 
and 
determine whether the ﬁlter is lowpass or high-
pass, but one of the components must be reactive.
Figure 14.42 shows a typical active lowpass ﬁlter. For this ﬁlter,
the transfer function is
(14.58)
where 
and
(14.59)
Therefore,
(14.60)
We notice that Eq. (14.60) is similar to Eq. (14.50), except that there
is a low frequency 
gain or dc gain of 
Also, the cor-
ner frequency is
(14.61)
which does not depend on 
This means that several inputs with dif-
ferent 
could be summed if required, and the corner frequency would
remain the same for each input.

The circuit in Fig. 14.42 may be combined with that in Fig. 14.43 to
form a bandpass ﬁlter that will have a gain K over the required range
of frequencies. By cascading a unity-gain lowpass ﬁlter, a unity-gain

Bandreject (or Notch) Filter
A bandreject ﬁlter may be constructed by parallel combination of a
lowpass ﬁlter and a highpass ﬁlter and a summing ampliﬁer, as shown
in the block diagram of Fig. 14.46(a). The circuit is designed such that
the lower cutoff frequency 
is set by the lowpass ﬁlter while the
upper cutoff frequency 
is set by the highpass ﬁlter. The gap between
and 
is the bandwidth of the ﬁlter. As shown in Fig. 14.46(b), the
ﬁlter passes frequencies below

The formulas for calculating the values of 
the center frequency,
bandwidth, and quality factor are the same as in Eqs. (14.66) to (14.70).
To determine the passband gain K of the ﬁlter, we can write
Eq. (14.74) in terms of the upper and lower corner frequencies as
(14.75)
Comparing this with the standard form in Eq. (14.15) indicates that in
the two passbands

We can also ﬁnd the gain at the center frequency by ﬁnding the mag-
nitude of the transfer function at

many other active ﬁlters that are more complex.

values by scaling. We have taken advantage of this idea by not using
realistic element values in most of our examples and problems; mas-
tering circuit analysis is made easy by using convenient component val-
ues. We have thus eased calculations, knowing that we could use
scaling to then make the values realistic.
There are two ways of scaling a circuit: magnitude or impedance
scaling, and frequency scaling. Both are useful in scaling responses
and circuit elements to values within the practical ranges. While mag-
nitude scaling leaves the frequency response of a circuit unaltered,
frequency scaling shifts the frequency response up or down the fre-
quency spectrum.
14.9.1
Magnitude Scaling
Magnitude scaling is the process of increasing all impedances in a net-
work by a factor, the frequency response remaining unchanged.
Recall that impedances of individual elements R, L, and C are
given by
(14.78)
In magnitude scaling, we multiply the impedance of each circuit ele-
ment by a factor 
and let the frequency remain constant. This gives
the new impedances as
(14.79)
Comparing Eq. (14.79) with Eq. (14.78), we notice the following changes
in the element values: 
and 
Thus, in
magnitude scaling, the new values of the elements and frequency are 
(14.80)
The primed variables are the new values and the unprimed variables
are the old values. Consider the series or parallel RLC circuit. We
now have
(14.81)
showing that the resonant frequency, as expected, has not changed.
Similarly, the quality factor and the bandwidth are not affected by mag-
nitude scaling. Also, magnitude scaling does not affect transfer func-
tions in the forms of Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b), which are dimensionless
quantities.

Frequency Response
Frequency scaling is equivalent to rela-
beling the frequency axis of a fre-
quency response plot. It is needed
when translating frequencies such as a
resonant frequency, a corner frequency,
a bandwidth, etc., to a realistic level. It
can be used to bring capacitance and
inductance values into a range that is
convenient to work with.
Frequency scaling is the process of shifting the frequency response of
a network up or down the frequency axis while leaving the impedance
the same.
We achieve frequency scaling by multiplying the frequency by a fac-
tor 
while keeping the impedance the same.
From Eq. (14.78), we see that the impedances of L and C are
frequency-dependent. If we apply frequency scaling to 
and 
in Eq. (14.78), we obtain
(14.82a)
(14.82b)
since the impedance of the inductor and capacitor must remain the
same after frequency scaling. We notice the following changes in the
element values: 
and 
The value of R is not
affected, since its impedance does not depend on frequency. Thus, in
frequency scaling, the new values of the elements and frequency are
(14.83)
Again, if we consider the series or parallel RLC circuit, for the reso-
nant frequency
(14.84)
and for the bandwidth
(14.85)
but the quality factor remains the same 
14.9.3
Magnitude and Frequency Scaling
If a circuit is scaled in magnitude and frequency at the same time, then
(14.86)
These are more general formulas than those in Eqs. (14.80) and (14.83).
We set 
in Eq. (14.86) when there is no magnitude scaling or
when there is no frequency scaling.

Frequency Response Using PSpice
PSpice is a useful tool in the hands of the modern circuit designer for
obtaining the frequency response of circuits. The frequency response
is obtained using the AC Sweep as discussed in Section D.5 (Appen-
dix D). This requires that we specify in the AC Sweep dialog box Total
Pts, Start Freq, End Freq, and the sweep type. Total Pts is the num-
ber of points in the frequency sweep, and Start Freq and End Freq are,
respectively, the starting and ﬁnal frequencies, in hertz. In order to
know what frequencies to select for Start Freq and End Freq, one must
have an idea of the frequency range of interest by making a rough
sketch of the frequency response. In a complex circuit where this may
not be possible, one may use a trial-and-error approach.
There are three types of sweeps:
Linear: The frequency is varied linearly from Start Freq to End
Freq with Total Pts equally spaced points (or responses).
Octave: The frequency is swept logarithmically by octaves from
Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per octave. An octave is
a factor of 2 (e.g., 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16).
Decade: The frequency is varied logarithmically by decades from
Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per decade. A decade
is a factor of 10 (e.g., from 2 Hz to 20 Hz, 20 Hz to 200 Hz,
200 Hz to 2 kHz).
It is best to use a linear sweep when displaying a narrow frequency
range of interest, as a linear sweep displays the frequency range well
in a narrow range. Conversely, it is best to use a logarithmic (octave
or decade) sweep for displaying a wide frequency range of interest—
if a linear sweep is used for a wide range, all the data will be crowded
at the high- or low-frequency end and insufﬁcient data at the other end.
With the above speciﬁcations, PSpice performs a steady-state sinu-
soidal analysis of the circuit as the frequency of all the independent
sources is varied (or swept) from Start Freq to End Freq.
The PSpice A/D program produces a graphical output. The output
data type may be speciﬁed in the Trace Command Box by adding one
of the following sufﬁxes to V or I:
M
Amplitude of the sinusoid.
P
Phase of the sinusoid.
dB
Amplitude of the sinusoid in decibels, i.e.,

Solution:
The circuit treated in Example 14.15 is ﬁrst-order while the one in this
example is second-order. Since we are interested in Bode plots, we use
decade frequency sweep for 
with 50 points per
decade. We select this range because we know that the resonant

After drawing the circuit as in Fig. 14.55, we select Analysis/Setup/AC
Sweep, DCLICK Decade, enter 50 in the Total Pts box, 300 as the

simulate it by selecting Analysis/Simulate. This will automatically
bring up the PSpice A/D window and display V(C1:1) if there are no

Computation Using MATLAB
MATLAB is a software package that is widely used for engineering
computation and simulation. A review of MATLAB is provided in
Appendix E for the beginner. This section shows how to use the soft-
ware to numerically perform most of the operations presented in this
chapter and Chapter 15. The key to describing a system in MATLAB is
to specify the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the transfer
function of the system. Once this is done, we can use several MATLAB
commands to obtain the system’s Bode plots (frequency response) and
the system’s response to a given input.
The command bode produces the Bode plots (both magnitude and
phase) of a given transfer function H(s). The format of the command
is bode (num, den), where num is the numerator of H(s) and den is its
denominator. The frequency range and number of points are automat-
ically selected. For example, consider the transfer function in Exam-
ple 14.3. It is better to ﬁrst write the numerator and denominator in
polynomial forms.
14.11
Consider the network in Fig. 14.57. Use PSpice to obtain the Bode
plots for 
over a frequency from 1 kHz to 100 kHz using 20 points
per decade.
Vo
Practice Problem 14.16

Thus,
Using the following commands, the Bode plots are generated as shown
in Fig. 14.59. If necessary, the command logspace can be included to
generate a logarithmically spaced frequency and the command semilogx
can be used to produce a semilog scale.
>> num = [200 0];
% specify the numerator of H(s)
>> den = [1 12 20];
% specify the denominator of H(s)
>> bode(num, den);
% determine and draw Bode plots
The step response y(t) of a system is the output when the input x(t) is
the unit step function. The command step plots the step response of a sys-
tem given the numerator and denominator of the transfer function of that
system. The time range and number of points are automatically selected.
For example, consider a second-order system with the transfer function
We obtain the step response of the system shown in Fig. 14.60 by using
the following commands.
>> n = 12;
>> d = [1 3 12];
>> step(n,d);

Applications
Resonant circuits and ﬁlters are widely used, particularly in electron-
ics, power systems, and communications systems. For example, a
Notch ﬁlter with a cutoff frequency at 60 Hz may be used to eliminate
the 60-Hz power line noise in various communications electronics. Fil-
tering of signals in communications systems is necessary in order to
select the desired signal from a host of others in the same range (as in
the case of radio receivers discussed next) and also to minimize the
effects of noise and interference on the desired signal. In this section,
we consider one practical application of resonant circuits and two
applications of ﬁlters. The focus of each application is not to under-
stand the details of how each device works but to see how the circuits
considered in this chapter are applied in the practical devices.
14.12.1
Radio Receiver
Series and parallel resonant circuits are commonly used in radio and TV
receivers to tune in stations and to separate the audio signal from the
radio-frequency carrier wave. As an example, consider the block diagram
14.12

of an AM radio receiver shown in Fig. 14.62. Incoming amplitude-
modulated radio waves (thousands of them at different frequencies
from different broadcasting stations) are received by the antenna. A
resonant circuit (or a bandpass ﬁlter) is needed to select just one of the
incoming waves. The selected signal is very weak and is ampliﬁed in
stages in order to generate an audible audio-frequency wave. Thus, we
have the radio frequency (RF) ampliﬁer to amplify the selected broad-
cast signal, the intermediate frequency (IF) ampliﬁer to amplify an
internally generated signal based on the RF signal, and the audio ampli-
ﬁer to amplify the audio signal just before it reaches the loudspeaker.
It is much easier to amplify the signal at three stages than to build an
ampliﬁer to provide the same ampliﬁcation for the entire band.

Figure 14.62
A simpliﬁed block diagram of a superheterodyne AM radio receiver.
The type of AM receiver shown in Fig. 14.62 is known as the super-
heterodyne receiver. In the early development of radio, each ampliﬁca-
tion stage had to be tuned to the frequency of the incoming signal. This
way, each stage must have several tuned circuits to cover the entire AM
band (540 to 1600 kHz). To avoid the problem of having several reso-
nant circuits, modern receivers use a frequency mixer or heterodyne cir-
cuit, which always produces the same IF signal (445 kHz) but retains
the audio frequencies carried on the incoming signal. To produce the
constant IF frequency, the rotors of two separate variable capacitors are
mechanically coupled with one another so that they can be rotated
simultaneously with a single control; this is called ganged tuning. A
local oscillator ganged with the RF ampliﬁer produces an RF signal that
is combined with the incoming wave by the frequency mixer to produce
an output signal that contains the sum and the difference frequencies of
the two signals. For example, if the resonant circuit is tuned to receive an
800-kHz incoming signal, the local oscillator must produce a 1,255-kHz
signal, so that the sum 
and the difference
of frequencies are available at the output of
455 kHz)

the mixer. However, only the difference, 455 kHz, is used in practice.
This is the only frequency to which all the IF ampliﬁer stages are tuned,
regardless of the station dialed. The original audio signal (containing
the “intelligence”) is extracted in the detector stage. The detector basi-
cally removes the IF signal, leaving the audio signal. The audio signal
is ampliﬁed to drive the loudspeaker, which acts as a transducer con-
verting the electrical signal to sound.
Our major concern here is the tuning circuit for the AM radio
receiver. The operation of the FM radio receiver is different from that
of the AM receiver discussed here, and in a much different range of
frequencies, but the tuning is similar.

Solution:
The frequency range for AM broadcasting is 540 to 1,600 kHz. We
consider the low and high ends of the band. Since the resonant circuit
in Fig. 14.63 is a parallel type, we apply the ideas in Section 14.6.

Touch-Tone Telephone
A typical application of filtering is the touch-tone telephone set
shown in Fig. 14.64. The keypad has 12 buttons arranged in four rows
and three columns. The arrangement provides 12 distinct signals by
using seven tones divided into two groups: the low-frequency group
(697 to 941 Hz) and the high-frequency group (1,209 to 1,477 Hz).
Pressing a button generates a sum of two sinusoids corresponding
to its unique pair of frequencies. For example, pressing the number
6 button generates sinusoidal tones with frequencies 770 Hz and
1,477 Hz.

ﬁrst ampliﬁed and separated into their respective groups by the low-
pass (LP) and highpass (HP) ﬁlters. The limiters (L) are used to con-
vert the separated tones into square waves. The individual tones are
identiﬁed using seven bandpass (BP) ﬁlters, each ﬁlter passing one
tone and rejecting other tones. Each ﬁlter is followed by a detector
(D), which is energized when its input voltage exceeds a certain
level. The outputs of the detectors provide the required dc signals
needed by the switching system to connect the caller to the party
being called.

Crossover Network
Another typical application of ﬁlters is the crossover network that
couples an audio ampliﬁer to woofer and tweeter speakers, as shown
in Fig. 14.66(a). The network basically consists of one highpass RC
Using the standard 600-
resistor used in telephone circuits and a
series RLC circuit, design the bandpass ﬁlter 
in Fig. 14.65.
Solution:
The bandpass ﬁlter is the series RLC circuit in Fig. 14.35. Since 
passes frequencies 697 Hz to 852 Hz and is centered at 
Hz,
its bandwidth is

ﬁlter and one lowpass RL ﬁlter. It routes frequencies higher than a
prescribed crossover frequency 
to the tweeter (high-frequency
loudspeaker) and frequencies below 
into the woofer (low-frequency
loudspeaker). These loudspeakers have been designed to accommo-
date certain frequency responses. A woofer is a low-frequency loud-
speaker designed to reproduce the lower part of the frequency range,
up to about 3 kHz. A tweeter can reproduce audio frequencies from
about 3 kHz to about 20 kHz. The two speaker types can be com-
bined to reproduce the entire audio range of interest and provide the
optimum in frequency response.
By replacing the ampliﬁer with a voltage source, the approximate
equivalent circuit of the crossover network is shown in Fig. 14.66(b),
where the loudspeakers are modeled by resistors. As a highpass ﬁlter,
the transfer function 
is given by
(14.87)
Similarly, the transfer function of the lowpass ﬁlter is given by
(14.88)
The values of 
L, and C may be selected such that the two ﬁlters
have the same cutoff frequency, known as the crossover frequency, as
shown in Fig. 14.67.
The principle behind the crossover network is also used in the res-
onant circuit for a TV receiver, where it is necessary to separate the
video and audio bands of RF carrier frequencies. The lower-frequency
band (picture information in the range from about 30 Hz to about
4 MHz) is channeled into the receiver’s video ampliﬁer, while the high-
frequency band (sound information around 4.5 MHz) is channeled to
the receiver’s sound ampliﬁer.

Summary

Summary
1. The transfer function 
is the ratio of the output response 
to the input excitation 
; that is, 
2. The frequency response is the variation of the transfer function
with frequency.
3. Zeros of a transfer function 
are the values of 
that make
while poles are the values of s that make 
4. The decibel is the unit of logarithmic gain. For a voltage or current
gain G, its decibel equivalent is 
5. Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude and phase of the
transfer function as it varies with frequency. The straight-line
approximations of H (in dB) and 
(in degrees) are constructed
using the corner frequencies deﬁned by the poles and zeros of 
6. The resonant frequency is that frequency at which the imaginary part
of a transfer function vanishes. For series and parallel RLC circuits.
7. The half-power frequencies 
are those frequencies at which
the power dissipated is one-half of that dissipated at the resonant
frequency. The geometric mean between the half-power frequen-
cies is the resonant frequency, or
8. The bandwidth is the frequency band between half-power
frequencies:
9. The quality factor is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance
peak. It is the ratio of the resonant (angular) frequency to the
bandwidth,
10. A ﬁlter is a circuit designed to pass a band of frequencies and
reject others. Passive ﬁlters are constructed with resistors, capaci-
tors, and inductors. Active ﬁlters are constructed with resistors,
capacitors, and an active device, usually an op amp.
11. Four common types of ﬁlters are lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and
bandstop. A lowpass ﬁlter passes only signals whose frequencies are
below the cutoff frequency 
A highpass ﬁlter passes only signals
whose frequencies are above the cutoff frequency 
A bandpass
ﬁlter passes only signals whose frequencies are within a prescribed

A bandstop ﬁlter passes only signals whose
frequencies are outside a prescribed range 
12. Scaling is the process whereby unrealistic element values are
magnitude-scaled by a factor 
and/or frequency-scaled by a fac-
tor 
to produce realistic values.
13. PSpice can be used to obtain the frequency response of a circuit
if a frequency range for the response and the desired number of
points within the range are speciﬁed in the AC Sweep.
14. The radio receiver—one practical application of resonant circuits—
employs a bandpass resonant circuit to tune in one frequency
among all the broadcast signals picked up by the antenna.
15. The touch-tone telephone and the crossover network are two typi-
cal applications of ﬁlters. The touch-tone telephone system employs
ﬁlters to separate tones of different frequencies to activate elec-
tronic switches. The crossover network separates signals in differ-
ent frequency ranges so that they can be delivered to different
devices such as tweeters and woofers in a loudspeaker system.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.h), “the broad education necessary
to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a
global and societal context.”
As a student, you must make sure you acquire “the broad education
necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global
and societal context.” To some extent, if you are already enrolled in an
ABET-accredited engineering program, then some of the courses you
are required to take must meet this criteria. My recommendation is that
even if you are in such a program, you look at all the elective courses
you take to make sure that you expand your awareness of global issues
and societal concerns. The engineers of the future must fully under-
stand that they and their activities affect all of us in one way or another.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.i), “need for, and an ability to
engage in life-long learning.”
You must be fully aware of and recognize the “need for, and an abil-
ity to engage in life-long learning.” It almost seems absurd that this
need and ability must be stated. Yet, you would be surprised at how
many engineers do not really understand this concept. The only way to
be really able to keep up with the explosion in technology we are fac-
ing now and will be facing in the future is through constant learning.
This learning must include nontechnical issues as well as the latest
technology in your ﬁeld.
The best way to keep up with the state of the art in your ﬁeld is
through your colleagues and association with individuals you meet
through your technical organization or organizations (especially IEEE).
Reading state-of-the-art technical articles is the next best way to stay
current.

Introduction
Our goal in this and the following chapters is to develop techniques
for analyzing circuits with a wide variety of inputs and responses. Such
circuits are modeled by differential equations whose solutions describe
the total response behavior of the circuits. Mathematical methods have
been devised to systematically determine the solutions of differential
equations. We now introduce the powerful method of Laplace trans-
formation, which involves turning differential equations into algebraic
equations, thus greatly facilitating the solution process.
The idea of transformation should be familiar by now. When using
phasors for the analysis of circuits, we transform the circuit from
the time domain to the frequency or phasor domain. Once we obtain
the phasor result, we transform it back to the time domain. The Laplace
transform method follows the same process: We use the Laplace trans-
formation to transform the circuit from the time domain to the fre-
quency domain, obtain the solution, and apply the inverse Laplace
transform to the result to transform it back to the time domain.
The Laplace transform is signiﬁcant for a number of reasons. First,
it can be applied to a wider variety of inputs than phasor analysis. Sec-
ond, it provides an easy way to solve circuit problems involving ini-
tial conditions, because it allows us to work with algebraic equations
instead of differential equations. Third, the Laplace transform is capa-
ble of providing us, in one single operation, the total response of the
circuit comprising both the natural and forced responses.
We begin with the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform which gives
rise to its most essential properties. By examining these properties, we
shall see how and why the method works. This also helps us to better
appreciate the idea of mathematical transformations. We also consider
some properties of the Laplace transform that are very helpful in circuit
analysis. We then consider the inverse Laplace transform, transfer func-
tions, and convolution. In this chapter, we will focus on the mechan-
ics of the Laplace transformation. In Chapter 16 we will examine how

Chapter 15
Introduction to the Laplace Transform
Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827), a French astronomer and mathe-
matician, ﬁrst presented the transform that bears his name and its
applications to differential equations in 1779.
Born of humble origins in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy, France,
Laplace became a professor of mathematics at the age of 20. His math-
ematical abilities inspired the famous mathematician Simeon Poisson,
who called Laplace the Isaac Newton of France. He made important
contributions in potential theory, probability theory, astronomy, and
celestial mechanics. He was widely known for his work, Traite de
Mecanique Celeste (Celestial Mechanics), which supplemented the
work of Newton on astronomy. The Laplace transform, the subject of
this chapter, is named after him.
Historical

the Laplace transform is applied in circuit analysis, network stability,
and network synthesis.
Deﬁnition of the Laplace Transform
Given a function f(t), its Laplace transform, denoted by F(s) or 
is deﬁned by
(15.1)
where s is a complex variable given by
(15.2)
Since the argument st of the exponent e in Eq. (15.1) must be dimen-
sionless, it follows that s has the dimensions of frequency and units of
inverse seconds 
or “frequency.” In Eq. (15.1), the lower limit is
speciﬁed as 
to indicate a time just before 
. We use 
as the
lower limit to include the origin and capture any discontinuity of f(t) at
; this will accommodate functions—such as singularity functions—
that may be discontinuous at 
.
It should be noted that the integral in Eq. (15.1) is a deﬁnite inte-
gral with respect to time. Hence, the result of integration is indepen-
dent of time and only involves the variable “s.”
Equation (15.1) illustrates the general concept of transformation.
The function f(t) is transformed into the function F(s). Whereas the
former function involves t as its argument, the latter involves s. We say
the transformation is from t-domain to s-domain. Given the interpreta-
tion of s as frequency, we arrive at the following description of the
Laplace transform:
t  0
t  0
0
t  0
0 (s1)
s  s  j
L[ f (t)]  F(s)  

0  f (t)est dt
L[ f (t)],
15.2
15.2
Deﬁnition of the Laplace Transform
677
For an ordinary function f (t), the lower
limit can be replaced by 0.
The Laplace transform is an integral transformation of a function f (t)
from the time domain into the complex frequency domain, giving F (s).
When the Laplace transform is applied to circuit analysis, the dif-
ferential equations represent the circuit in the time domain. The terms
in the differential equations take the place of f(t). Their Laplace trans-
form, which corresponds to F(s), constitutes algebraic equations rep-
resenting the circuit in the frequency domain.
We assume in Eq. (15.1) that f(t) is ignored for 
To ensure
that this is the case, a function is often multiplied by the unit step.
Thus, f(t) is written as f(t)u(t) or f(t), 
The Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is known as the one-sided (or
unilateral) Laplace transform. The two-sided (or bilateral) Laplace
transform is given by
(15.3)
The one-sided Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1), being adequate for our
purposes, is the only type of Laplace transform that we will treat in
this book.

t 6 0.

A function f(t) may not have a Laplace transform. In order for f(t)
to have a Laplace transform, the integral in Eq. (15.1) must converge
to a ﬁnite value. Since 
for any value of t, the integral con-
verges when
(15.4)
for some real value 
Thus, the region of convergence for the
Laplace transform is 
as shown in Fig. 15.1. In this
region, 
and F(s) exists. F(s) is undefined outside the
region of convergence. Fortunately, all functions of interest in circuit
analysis satisfy the convergence criterion in Eq. (15.4) and have
Laplace transforms. Therefore, it is not necessary to specify 
in
what follows.
A companion to the direct Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is the
inverse Laplace transform given by
(15.5)
where the integration is performed along a straight line (
) in the region of convergence, 
. See Fig. 15.1. The
direct application of Eq. (15.5) involves some knowledge about com-
plex analysis beyond the scope of this book. For this reason, we will
not use Eq. (15.5) to ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform. We will rather
use a look-up table, to be developed in Section 15.3. The functions f(t)
and F(s) are regarded as a Laplace transform pair where
(15.6)
meaning that there is one-to-one correspondence between f(t) and
F(s). The following examples derive the Laplace transforms of some
important functions.

Properties of the Laplace Transform
The properties of the Laplace transform help us to obtain transform
pairs without directly using Eq. (15.1) as we did in Examples 15.1 and
15.2. As we derive each of these properties, we should keep in mind
the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).
15.3

Linearity
If 
and 
are, respectively, the Laplace transforms of 
and
, then
(15.7)
where 
and 
are constants. Equation 15.7 expresses the linearity
property of the Laplace transform. The proof of Eq. (15.7) follows
readily from the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).
For example, by the linearity property in Eq. (15.7), we may write
(15.8)
But from Example 15.1(b), 
. Hence,
(15.9)
Scaling
If F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), then
(15.10)
where a is a constant and 
If we let 
then
(15.11)
Comparing this integral with the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in
Eq. (15.1) shows that s in Eq. (15.1) must be replaced by 
while
the dummy variable t is replaced by x. Hence, we obtain the scaling
property as
(15.12)
For example, we know from Example 15.2 that
(15.13)
Using the scaling property in Eq. (15.12),
(15.14)

For the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the equation, evaluating the
term at

Hence,

the transform f(t) deﬁned over its ﬁrst period only. Equation (15.40)
shows that the Laplace transform of a periodic function is the trans-
form of the ﬁrst period of the function divided by 
Initial and Final Values
The initial-value and ﬁnal-value properties allow us to ﬁnd the initial
value 
and the ﬁnal value 
of f(t) directly from its Laplace
transform F(s). To obtain these properties, we begin with the differen-
tiation property in Eq. (15.23), namely,

If we let 
the integrand in Eq. (15.41) vanishes due to the damp-
ing exponential factor, and Eq. (15.41) becomes
Since 
is independent of s, we can write
(15.42)
This is known as the initial-value theorem. For example, we know from
Eq. (15.21a) that

Properties of the Laplace Transform

In Eq. (15.41), we let 
then
or
(15.44)
This is referred to as the ﬁnal-value theorem. In order for the ﬁnal-
value theorem to hold, all poles of F(s) must be located in the left
half of the s plane (see Fig. 15.1 or Fig. 15.9); that is, the poles must
have negative real parts. The only exception to this requirement is
the case in which F(s) has a simple pole at 
because the effect
of 
will be nulliﬁed by 
in Eq. (15.44). For example, from
Eq. (15.21b),
(15.45)
Applying the ﬁnal-value theorem,
as expected from the given f (t). As another example,
(15.46)
so that
This is incorrect, because 
oscillates between 
and 
and
does not have a limit as 
Thus, the ﬁnal-value theorem cannot
be used to ﬁnd the ﬁnal value of 
because F(s) has poles at
which are not in the left half of the s plane. In general, the ﬁnal-
value theorem does not apply in ﬁnding the ﬁnal values of sinusoidal
functions—these functions oscillate forever and do not have ﬁnal values.
The initial-value and ﬁnal-value theorems depict the relationship
between the origin and inﬁnity in the time domain and the s-domain.
They serve as useful checks on Laplace transforms.
Table 15.1 provides a list of the properties of the Laplace trans-
form. The last property (on convolution) will be proved in Sec-
tion 15.5. There are other properties, but these are enough for present
purposes. Table 15.2 summarizes the Laplace transforms of some
common functions. We have omitted the factor u(t) except where it
is necessary.
We should mention that many software packages, such as Math-
cad, MATLAB, Maple, and Mathematica, offer symbolic math. For
example, Mathcad has symbolic math for the Laplace, Fourier, and Z
transforms as well as the inverse function.

Practice Problem 15.7
The Inverse Laplace Transform
Given F(s), how do we transform it back to the time domain and obtain
the corresponding f(t)? By matching entries in Table 15.2, we avoid
using Eq. (15.5) to ﬁnd f(t).
Suppose F(s) has the general form of
(15.47)
where N(s) is the numerator polynomial and D(s) is the denominator
polynomial. The roots of 
are called the zeros of F(s), while
the roots of 
are the poles of F(s). Although Eq. (15.47) is
similar in form to Eq. (14.3), here F(s) is the Laplace transform of a
function, which is not necessarily a transfer function. We use partial
fraction expansion to break F(s) down into simple terms whose inverse
transform we obtain from Table 15.2. Thus, ﬁnding the inverse Laplace
transform of F(s) involves two steps.
D(s)  0
N(s)  0
F(s)  N(s)
D(s)
15.4
Software packages such as MATLAB,
Mathcad, and Maple are capable of
ﬁnding partial fraction expansions
quite easily.
Steps to Find the Inverse Laplace Transform:
1. Decompose F(s) into simple terms using partial fraction
expansion.
2. Find the inverse of each term by matching entries in Table 15.2.
Let us consider the three possible forms F(s) may take and how to
apply the two steps to each form.
15.4.1
Simple Poles
Recall from Chapter 14 that a simple pole is a ﬁrst-order pole. If F(s)
has only simple poles, then D(s) becomes a product of factors, so that
(15.48)
where 
are the simple poles, and 
for all
(i.e., the poles are distinct). Assuming that the degree of N(s) is

s  p1, p2, p , pn
F(s) 
N(s)
(s  p1) (s  p2)  p
  (s  pn )
Otherwise, we must ﬁrst apply long
division so that F(s)
N(s)D(s)
Q(s)
R(s)D(s), where the degree
of R(s), the remainder of the long
division, is less than the degree of D (s).




less than the degree of D(s), we use partial fraction expansion to
decompose F(s) in Eq. (15.48) as
(15.49)
The expansion coefﬁcients 
are known as the residues of
F(s). There are many ways of ﬁnding the expansion coefﬁcients. One
way is using the residue method. If we multiply both sides of Eq. (15.49)
by 
we obtain
(15.50)
Since 
, setting 
in Eq. (15.50) leaves only 
on the
right-hand side of Eq. (15.50). Hence,
(15.51)
Thus, in general,
(15.52)
This is known as Heaviside’s theorem. Once the values of 
are known,
we proceed to ﬁnd the inverse of F(s) using Eq. (15.49). Since the
inverse transform of each term in Eq. (15.49) is 
, then, from Table 15.2,
(15.53)
15.4.2
Repeated Poles
Suppose F(s) has n repeated poles at 
. Then we may represent
F(s) as
(15.54)
where 
is the remaining part of F(s) that does not have a pole at
We determine the expansion coefﬁcient 
as
(15.55)
as we did above. To determine 
, we multiply each term in Eq. (15.54)
by 
and differentiate to get rid of 
, then evaluate the result at
to get rid of the other coefﬁcients except 
. Thus, we obtain
(15.56)

The Inverse Laplace Transform

Historical note: Named after Oliver
Heaviside (1850–1925), an English
engineer, the pioneer of operational
calculus.

The mth term becomes
(15.58)
where 
. One can expect the differentiation to be dif-
ﬁcult to handle as m increases. Once we obtain the values of 
by partial fraction expansion, we apply the inverse transform
(15.59)
to each term on the right-hand side of Eq. (15.54) and obtain
(15.60)
15.4.3
Complex Poles
A pair of complex poles is simple if it is not repeated; it is a double
or multiple pole if repeated. Simple complex poles may be handled the
same way as simple real poles, but because complex algebra is involved
the result is always cumbersome. An easier approach is a method
known as completing the square. The idea is to express each complex
pole pair (or quadratic term) in D(s) as a complete square such as
and then use Table 15.2 to ﬁnd the inverse of the term.
Since N(s) and D(s) always have real coefﬁcients and we know
that the complex roots of polynomials with real coefﬁcients must occur
in conjugate pairs, F(s) may have the general form
(15.61)
where 
is the remaining part of F(s) that does not have this pair
of complex poles. If we complete the square by letting
(15.62)
and we also let
(15.63)
then Eq. (15.61) becomes
(15.64)
From Table 15.2, the inverse transform is
(15.65)
The sine and cosine terms can be combined using Eq. (9.11).
Whether the pole is simple, repeated, or complex, a general
approach that can always be used in ﬁnding the expansion coefﬁcients

is the method of algebra, illustrated in Examples 15.9 to 15.11. To
apply the method, we ﬁrst set 
equal to an expansion
containing unknown constants. We multiply the result through by a
common denominator. Then we determine the unknown constants by
equating coefﬁcients (i.e., by algebraically solving a set of simultaneous
equations for these coefﬁcients at like powers of s).
Another general approach is to substitute speciﬁc, convenient val-
ues of s to obtain as many simultaneous equations as the number of
unknown coefﬁcients, and then solve for the unknown coefﬁcients. We
must make sure that each selected value of s is not one of the poles of
F(s). Example 15.11 illustrates this idea.

speciﬁc values of s [say

Introduction to the Laplace Transform

Taking the inverse of each term, we obtain
(15.11.5)
It is alright to leave the result this way. However, we can combine the
cosine and sine terms as
(15.11.6)
To obtain Eq. (15.11.6) from Eq. (15.11.5), we apply Eq. (9.11). Next,
we determine the coefﬁcient R and the phase angle :

Practice Problem 15.11
The Convolution Integral
The term convolution means “folding.” Convolution is an invaluable tool
to the engineer because it provides a means of viewing and characteriz-
ing physical systems. For example, it is used in ﬁnding the response y(t)
of a system to an excitation x(t), knowing the system impulse response
h(t). This is achieved through the convolution integral, deﬁned as
(15.66)
or simply
(15.67)
where 
is a dummy variable and the asterisk denotes convolution. Equa-
tion (15.66) or (15.67) states that the output is equal to the input convolved
with the unit impulse response. The convolution process is commutative:
(15.68a)
or
(15.68b)
This implies that the order in which the two functions are convolved
is immaterial. We will see shortly how to take advantage of this com-
mutative property when performing graphical computation of the con-
volution integral.

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
The convolution of two signals consists of time-reversing one of the
signals, shifting it, and multiplying it point by point with the second
signal, and integrating the product.
The convolution integral in Eq. (15.66) is the general one; it
applies to any linear system. However, the convolution integral can be
simpliﬁed if we assume that a system has two properties. First, if
for 
then
(15.69)
Second, if the system’s impulse response is causal (i.e., 
for
), then 
for 
or 
, so that Eq. (15.69)
becomes

Here are some properties of the convolution integral.

Before learning how to evaluate the convolution integral in
Eq. (15.70), let us establish the link between the Laplace transform and
the convolution integral. Given two functions 
and 
with Laplace
transforms 
and 
, respectively, their convolution is
(15.71)
Taking the Laplace transform gives
(15.72)
To prove that Eq. (15.72) is true, we begin with the fact that 
is deﬁned as

Steps to Evaluate the Convolution Integral:
1. Folding: Take the mirror image of 
about the ordinate axis
to obtain 
.
2. Displacement: Shift or delay 
by t to obtain 
.
3. Multiplication: Find the product of 
and 
.
4. Integration: For a given time t, calculate the area under the
product 
for

We recall from the time shift property in Eq. (15.17) that the term in
brackets can be written as
(15.75)
Substituting Eq. (15.75) into Eq. (15.74) gives
(15.76)
Interchanging the order of integration results in
(15.77)
The integral in brackets extends only from 0 to t because the delayed
unit step 
for 
and 
for 
. We notice
that the integral is the convolution of 
and 
as in Eq. (15.71).
Hence,
(15.78)
as desired. This indicates that convolution in the time domain is equiv-
alent to multiplication in the s-domain. For example, if 
and
, applying the property in Eq. (15.78), we get
(15.79)
Although we can find the convolution of two signals using
Eq. (15.78), as we have just done, if the product 
is very
complicated, ﬁnding the inverse may be tough. Also, there are situa-
tions in which 
and 
are available in the form of experimental
data and there are no explicit Laplace transforms. In these cases, one
must do the convolution in the time domain.
The process of convolving two signals in the time domain is bet-
ter appreciated from a graphical point of view. The graphical proce-
dure for evaluating the convolution integral in Eq. (15.70) usually
involves four steps.

The Convolution Integral
699

The folding operation in step 1 is the reason for the term convolution.
The function 
scans or slides over 
. In view of this
superposition procedure, the convolution integral is also known as the
superposition integral.
To apply the four steps, it is necessary to be able to sketch 
and 
. To get 
from the original function x(t) involves
merely replacing every t with . Sketching 
is the key to the
convolution process. It involves reﬂecting 
about the vertical axis
and shifting it by t. Analytically, we obtain 
by replacing every
t in h(t) by 
. Since convolution is commutative, it may be more
convenient to apply steps 1 and 2 to x(t) instead of h(t). The best way
to illustrate the procedure is with some examples.

Find the convolution of the two signals in Fig. 15.10.
Solution:
We follow the four steps to get 
. First, we fold 
as shown in Fig. 15.11(a) and shift it by t as shown in Fig. 15.11(b).
For different values of t, we now multiply the two functions and
integrate to determine the area of the overlapping region.
For 
, there is no overlap of the two functions, as shown
in Fig. 15.12(a). Hence,
(15.12.1)
For 
, the two signals overlap between 1 and t, as shown in
Fig. 15.12(b).
(15.12.2)
For 
, the two signals completely overlap between 
and t, as shown in Fig. 15.12(c). It is easy to see that the area under
the curve is 2. Or
(15.12.3)
For 
, the two signals overlap between 
and 3, as
shown in Fig. 15.12(d).

For

from one range of t to another. The result in Eq. (15.12.6) can be
obtained without using the graphical procedure—by directly using
Eq. (15.70) and the properties of step functions. This will be illustrated

For the RL circuit in Fig. 15.21(a), use the convolution integral to ﬁnd
the response 
due to the excitation shown in Fig. 15.21(b).
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is clearly stated and the method of solution
is also speciﬁed.
io(t)
Example 15.14

2. Present. We are to use the convolution integral to solve for the
response 
due to 
shown in Fig. 15.21(b).
3. Alternative. We have learned to do convolution by using the
convolution integral and how to do it graphically. In addition,
we could always work in the s-domain to solve for the current.
We will solve for the current using the convolution integral and
then check it using the graphical approach.
4. Attempt. As we stated, this problem can be solved in two
ways: directly using the convolution integral or using the
graphical technique. To use either approach, we ﬁrst need
the unit impulse response h(t) of the circuit. In the s-domain,
applying the current division principle to the circuit in
Fig. 15.22(a) gives
Hence,
(15.14.1)
and the inverse Laplace transform of this gives
(15.14.2)
Figure 15.22(b) shows the impulse response h(t) of the circuit.
To use the convolution integral directly, recall that the
response is given in the s-domain as
With the given 
in Fig. 15.21(b),
so that

Application to Integrodifferential
Equations
The Laplace transform is useful in solving linear integrodifferential
equations. Using the differentiation and integration properties of Laplace
transforms, each term in the integrodifferential equation is transformed.
15.6

Initial conditions are automatically taken into account. We solve the
resulting algebraic equation in the s-domain. We then convert the solution
back to the time domain by using the inverse transform. The follow-
ing examples illustrate the process.

Summary
1. The Laplace transform allows a signal represented by a function
in the time domain to be analyzed in the s-domain (or complex
frequency domain). It is deﬁned as
2. Properties of the Laplace transform are listed in Table 15.1, while
the Laplace transforms of basic common functions are listed in
Table 15.2.
3. The inverse Laplace transform can be found using partial fraction
expansions and using the Laplace transform pairs in Table 15.2 as
a look-up table. Real poles lead to exponential functions and com-
plex poles to damped sinusoids.
4. The convolution of two signals consists of time-reversing one of
the signals, shifting it, multiplying it point by point with the sec-
ond signal, and integrating the product. The convolution integral
relates the convolution of two signals in the time domain to the
inverse of the product of their Laplace transforms:
5. In the time domain, the output y(t) of the network is the convolu-
tion of the impulse response with the input x(t),
Convolution may be regarded as the ﬂip-shift-multiply-time-area
method.
6. The Laplace transform can be used to solve a linear integrodiffer-
ential equation.

Communication skills are the most important skills any engineer can
have. A very critical element in this tool set is the ability to ask a ques-
tion and understand the answer, a very simple thing and yet it may
make the difference between success and failure!

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Asking Questions
In over 30 years of teaching, I have struggled with determining how best
to help students learn. Regardless of how much time students spend in
studying for a course, the most helpful activity for students is learning how
to ask questions in class and then asking those questions. The student, by
asking questions, becomes actively involved in the learning process and no
longer is merely a passive receptor of information. I think this active
involvement contributes so much to the learning process that it is probably
the single most important aspect to the development of a modern engineer.
In fact, asking questions is the basis of science. As Charles P. Steinmetz
rightly said, “No man really becomes a fool until he stops asking questions.”
It seems very straightforward and quite easy to ask questions. Have
we not been doing that all our lives? The truth is to ask questions in
an appropriate manner and to maximize the learning process takes
some thought and preparation.
I am sure that there are several models one could effectively use. Let
me share what has worked for me. The most important thing to keep in
mind is that you do not have to form a perfect question. Since the question-
and-answer format allows the question to be developed in an iterative man-
ner, the original question can easily be reﬁned as you go. I frequently tell
students that they are most welcome to read their questions in class.
Here are three things you should keep in mind when asking ques-
tions. First, prepare your question. If you are like many students who are
either shy or have not learned to ask questions in class, you may wish to
start with a question you have written down outside of class. Second, wait
for an appropriate time to ask the question. Simply use your judgment on
that. Third, be prepared to clarify your question by paraphrasing it or say-
ing it in a different way in case you are asked to repeat the question.

Steps in Applying the Laplace Transform:
1. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the s-domain.
2. Solve the circuit using nodal analysis, mesh analysis, source
transformation, superposition, or any circuit analysis technique
with which we are familiar.
3. Take the inverse transform of the solution and thus obtain the
solution in the time domain.
A system is a mathematical model of a physical process relating the
input to the output.
One last comment: Not all professors like students to ask ques-
tions in class even though they may say they do. You need to ﬁnd out
which professors like classroom questions. Good luck in enhancing one
of your most important skills as an engineer.
Introduction
Now that we have introduced the Laplace transform, let us see what
we can do with it. Please keep in mind that with the Laplace transform
we actually have one of the most powerful mathematical tools for
analysis, synthesis, and design. Being able to look at circuits and sys-
tems in the s-domain can help us to understand how our circuits and
systems really function. In this chapter we will take an in-depth look
at how easy it is to work with circuits in the s-domain. In addition, we
will brieﬂy look at physical systems. We are sure you have studied
some mechanical systems and may have used the same differential
equations to describe them as we use to describe our electric circuits.
Actually that is a wonderful thing about the physical universe in which
we live; the same differential equations can be used to describe any
linear circuit, system, or process. The key is the term linear.
16.1

Chapter 16
Applications of the Laplace Transform
It is entirely appropriate to consider circuits as systems. Histori-
cally, circuits have been discussed as a separate topic from systems, so
we will actually talk about circuits and systems in this chapter realiz-
ing that circuits are nothing more than a class of electrical systems.
The most important thing to remember is that everything we discussed
in the last chapter and in this chapter applies to any linear system. In the
last chapter, we saw how we can use Laplace transforms to solve linear
differential equations and integral equations. In this chapter, we introduce
the concept of modeling circuits in the s-domain. We can use that princi-
ple to help us solve just about any kind of linear circuit. We will take a
quick look at how state variables can be used to analyze systems with mul-
tiple inputs and multiple outputs. Finally, we examine how the Laplace
transform is used in network stability analysis and in network synthesis.
Circuit Element Models
Having mastered how to obtain the Laplace transform and its inverse,
we are now prepared to employ the Laplace transform to analyze cir-
cuits. This usually involves three steps.
16.2

Only the ﬁrst step is new and will be discussed here. As we did in pha-
sor analysis, we transform a circuit in the time domain to the frequency
or s-domain by Laplace transforming each term in the circuit.
For a resistor, the voltage-current relationship in the time domain is
(16.1)
Taking the Laplace transform, we get
(16.2)
For an inductor,
(16.3)
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides gives
(16.4)
or
(16.5)
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.1, where the initial con-
dition is modeled as a voltage or current source.
For a capacitor,
(16.6)
which transforms into the s-domain as
(16.7)
or
(16.8)
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.2. With the s-domain
equivalents, the Laplace transform can be used readily to solve ﬁrst- and

second-order circuits such as those we considered in Chapters 7 and 8.
We should observe from Eqs. (16.3) to (16.8) that the initial conditions
are part of the transformation. This is one advantage of using the
Laplace transform in circuit analysis. Another advantage is that a com-
plete response—transient and steady state—of a network is obtained.
We will illustrate this with Examples 16.2 and 16.3. Also, observe the
duality of Eqs. (16.5) and (16.8), conﬁrming what we already know
from Chapter 8 (see Table 8.1), namely, that L and C, I(s) and V(s),
and 
and 
are dual pairs.
If we assume zero initial conditions for the inductor and the capac-
itor, the above equations reduce to:
(16.9)
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.3.
We deﬁne the impedance in the s-domain as the ratio of the volt-
age transform to the current transform under zero initial conditions;
that is,
(16.10)
Thus, the impedances of the three circuit elements are
(16.11)
Table 16.1 summarizes these. The admittance in the s-domain is the
reciprocal of the impedance, or
(16.12)
The use of the Laplace transform in circuit analysis facilitates the use
of various signal sources such as impulse, step, ramp, exponential, and
sinusoidal.
The models for dependent sources and op amps are easy to develop
drawing from the simple fact that if the Laplace transform of f(t) is
F(s), then the Laplace transform of af(t) is aF(s)—the linearity prop-
erty. The dependent source model is a little easier in that we deal with
a single value. The dependent source can have only two controlling
values, a constant times either a voltage or a current. Thus,
(16.13)
(16.14)
The ideal op amp can be treated just like a resistor. Nothing within
an op amp, either real or ideal, does anything more than multiply a
voltage by a constant. Thus, we only need to write the equations as we
always do using the constraint that the input voltage to the op amp has
to be zero and the input current has to be zero.

thus providing a complete (transient

Circuit Analysis
Circuit analysis is again relatively easy to do when we are in the
s-domain. We merely need to transform a complicated set of mathe-
matical relationships in the time domain into the s-domain where we
convert operators (derivatives and integrals) into simple multipliers of
s and 
This now allows us to use algebra to set up and solve our
circuit equations. The exciting thing about this is that all of the circuit
theorems and relationships we developed for dc circuits are perfectly
valid in the s-domain.

Practice Problem 16.4
For the circuit shown in Fig. 16.12, and the initial conditions used
in Example 16.4, use superposition to ﬁnd the value of the capacitor
voltage.
Solution:
Since the circuit in the s-domain actually has three independent sources,
we can look at the solution one source at a time. Figure 16.13 presents
the circuits in the s-domain considering one source at a time. We now
have three nodal analysis problems. First, let us solve for the capacitor
voltage in the circuit shown in Fig. 16.13(a).

Transfer Functions
The transfer function is a key concept in signal processing because it
indicates how a signal is processed as it passes through a network. It
is a ﬁtting tool for ﬁnding the network response, determining (or
designing for) network stability, and network synthesis. The transfer
function of a network describes how the output behaves with respect
to the input. It speciﬁes the transfer from the input to the output in the
s-domain, assuming no initial energy.
16.4
726
Chapter 16
Applications of the Laplace Transform
For electrical networks, the transfer
function is also known as the network
function.
The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output response Y(s) to
the input excitation X(s), assuming all initial conditions are zero.
Thus,
(16.15)
The transfer function depends on what we deﬁne as input and output.
Since the input and output can be either current or voltage at any place
in the circuit, there are four possible transfer functions:
(16.16a)
(16.16b)
(16.16c)
(16.16d)
Thus, a circuit can have many transfer functions. Note that H(s) is
dimensionless in Eqs. (16.16a) and (16.16b).
Each of the transfer functions in Eq. (16.16) can be found in two
ways. One way is to assume any convenient input X(s), use any cir-
cuit analysis technique (such as current or voltage division, nodal or
mesh analysis) to ﬁnd the output Y(s), and then obtain the ratio of
the two. The other approach is to apply the ladder method, which
involves walking our way through the circuit. By this approach, we
assume that the output is 1 V or 1 A as appropriate and use the basic
laws of Ohm and Kirchhoff (KCL only) to obtain the input. The
transfer function becomes unity divided by the input. This approach
may be more convenient to use when the circuit has many loops or
nodes so that applying nodal or mesh analysis becomes cumbersome.
In the ﬁrst method, we assume an input and ﬁnd the output; in the
second method, we assume the output and find the input. In
both methods, we calculate H(s) as the ratio of output to input trans-
forms. The two methods rely on the linearity property, since we only
deal with linear circuits in this book. Example 16.8 illustrates these
methods.
H(s)  Admittance  I(s)
V(s)
H(s)  Impedance  V(s)

H(s)  Current gain  Io(s)
Ii(s)
H(s)  Voltage gain  Vo(s)
Vi(s)
H(s)  Y(s)
X(s)
Some authors would not consider
Eqs. (16.16c) and (16.16d) transfer
functions.

Equation (16.15) assumes that both X(s) and Y(s) are known.
Sometimes, we know the input X(s) and the transfer function H(s). We
ﬁnd the output Y(s) as
(16.17)
and take the inverse transform to get y(t). A special case is when the
input is the unit impulse function, 
so that 
For this
case,
(16.18)
where
(16.19)
The term h(t) represents the unit impulse response—it is the time-domain
response of the network to a unit impulse. Thus, Eq. (16.19) provides a
new interpretation for the transfer function: H(s) is the Laplace transform
of the unit impulse response of the network. Once we know the impulse
response h(t) of a network, we can obtain the response of the network
to any input signal using Eq. (16.17) in the s-domain or using the con-
volution integral (section 15.5) in the time domain.

State Variables
Thus far in this book we have considered techniques for analyzing sys-
tems with only one input and only one output. Many engineering systems
have many inputs and many outputs, as shown in Fig. 16.21. The state
variable method is a very important tool in analyzing systems and under-
standing such highly complex systems. Thus, the state variable model is
more general than the single-input, single-output model, such as a trans-
fer function. Although the topic cannot be adequately covered in one chap-
ter, let alone one section of a chapter, we will cover it brieﬂy at this point.

In the state variable model, we specify a collection of variables
that describe the internal behavior of the system. These variables are
known as the state variables of the system. They are the variables that
determine the future behavior of a system when the present state of
the system and the input signals are known. In other words, they are
those variables which, if known, allow all other system parameters to
be determined by using only algebraic equations.
16.5
State Variables
731
A state variable is a physical property that characterizes the state of a
system, regardless of how the system got to that state.
Common examples of state variables are the pressure, volume, and
temperature. In an electric circuit, the state variables are the inductor
current and capacitor voltage since they collectively describe the
energy state of the system.
The standard way to represent the state equations is to arrange
them as a set of ﬁrst-order differential equations:
(16.20)
where
and the dot represents the ﬁrst derivative with respect to time, i.e.,
and
A and B are respectively 
and 
matrices. In addition to the
state equation in Eq. (16.20), we need the output equation. The com-
plete state model or state space is

and C and D are, respectively, 
and

special case of single-input single-output, 
Assuming zero initial conditions, the transfer function of the sys-
tem is found by taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (16.21a); we obtain
or
(16.22)
where I is the identity matrix. Taking the Laplace transform of
Eq. (16.21b) yields
(16.23)
Substituting Eq. (16.22) into Eq. (16.23) and dividing by Z(s) gives
the transfer function as

In most cases, 
so the degree of the numerator of H(s) in
Eq. (16.24) is less than that of the denominator. Thus,

Steps to Apply the State Variable Method to
Circuit Analysis:
1. Select the inductor current i and capacitor voltage v as the state
variables, making sure they are consistent with the passive sign
convention.
2. Apply KCL and KVL to the circuit and obtain circuit variables
(voltages and currents) in terms of the state variables. This
should lead to a set of ﬁrst-order differential equations neces-
sary and sufﬁcient to determine all state variables.
3. Obtain the output equation and put the ﬁnal result in state-space
representation.
Steps 1 and 3 are usually straightforward; the major task is in
step 2. We will illustrate this with examples.

Assume we have a system where the output is y(t) and the input is z(t).
Let the following differential equation describe the relationship between
the input and the output.

First, we select the state variables. Let

From Eqs. (16.12.2) to (16.12.4), we can now write the following

To check this, we directly apply the Laplace transfer to each term in
Eq. (16.12.1). Since initial conditions are zero, we get

Applications
So far we have considered three applications of Laplace’s transform:
circuit analysis in general, obtaining transfer functions, and solving lin-
ear integrodifferential equations. The Laplace transform also ﬁnds
application in other areas in circuit analysis, signal processing, and con-
trol systems. Here we will consider two more important applications:
network stability and network synthesis.
16.6.1
Network Stability
A circuit is stable if its impulse response h(t) is bounded (i.e., h(t) con-
verges to a ﬁnite value) as 
; it is unstable if h(t) grows without
bound as 
In mathematical terms, a circuit is stable when
(16.26)
Since the transfer function H(s) is the Laplace transform of the impulse
response 
must meet certain requirements in order for
Eq. (16.26) to hold. Recall that H(s) may be written as
(16.27)
where the roots of 
are called the zeros of H(s) because they
make 
while the roots of 
are called the poles of H(s)
since they cause 
The zeros and poles of H(s) are often located
in the s plane as shown in Fig. 16.26(a). Recall from Eqs. (15.47) and
(15.48) that H(s) may also be written in terms of its poles as
(16.28)
H(s) must meet two requirements for the circuit to be stable. First, the
degree of N(s) must be less than the degree of D(s); otherwise, long
division would produce
(16.29)
where the degree of R(s), the remainder of the long division, is less
than the degree of D(s). The inverse of H(s) in Eq. (16.29) does not
meet the condition in Eq. (16.26). Second, all the poles of H(s) in

Eq. (16.27) (i.e., all the roots of

parts; in other words, all the poles must lie in the left half of the s plane,
as shown typically in Fig. 16.26(b). The reason for this will be appar-
ent if we take the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) in Eq. (16.27).
Since Eq. (16.27) is similar to Eq. (15.48), its partial fraction expan-
sion is similar to the one in Eq. (15.49) so that the inverse of H(s) is
similar to that in Eq. (15.53). Hence,
(16.30)
We see from this equation that each pole 
must be positive (i.e., pole
in the left-half plane) in order for 
to decrease with
increasing t. Thus,

Chapter 16
Applications of the Laplace Transform
A circuit is stable when all the poles of its transfer function H(s) lie in
the left half of the s plane.
An unstable circuit never reaches steady state because the transient
response does not decay to zero. Consequently, steady-state analysis is
only applicable to stable circuits.
A circuit made up exclusively of passive elements (
and C)
and independent sources cannot be unstable, because that would imply
that some branch currents or voltages would grow indeﬁnitely with
sources set to zero. Passive elements cannot generate such indeﬁnite
growth. Passive circuits either are stable or have poles with zero real
parts. To show that this is the case, consider the series RLC circuit in
Fig. 16.27. The transfer function is given by
or
(16.31)
Notice that 
is the same as the charac-
teristic equation obtained for the series RLC circuit in Eq. (8.8). The
circuit has poles at
(16.32)
where
For 
the two poles always lie in the left half of the s plane,
implying that the circuit is always stable. However, when 
and the circuit becomes unstable. Although ideally this is possible, it
does not really happen, because R is never zero.
On the other hand, active circuits or passive circuits with con-
trolled sources can supply energy, and they can be unstable. In fact,
an oscillator is a typical example of a circuit designed to be unstable.
An oscillator is designed such that its transfer function is of the form
(16.33)
so that its output is sinusoidal.

Network Synthesis
Network synthesis may be regarded as the process of obtaining an
appropriate network to represent a given transfer function. Network
synthesis is easier in the s-domain than in the time domain.
In network analysis, we ﬁnd the transfer function of a given net-
work. In network synthesis, we reverse the approach: Given a transfer
function, we are required to ﬁnd a suitable network.
Network synthesis is ﬁnding a network that represents a given transfer
function.
Keep in mind that in synthesis, there may be many different
answers—or possibly no answers—because there are many circuits that
can be used to represent the same transfer function; in network analy-
sis, there is only one answer.
Network synthesis is an exciting ﬁeld of prime engineering impor-
tance. Being able to look at a transfer function and come up with the
type of circuit it represents is a great asset to a circuit designer.
Although network synthesis constitutes a whole course by itself and
requires some experience, the following examples are meant to stimulate
your appetite.

Given the transfer function
realize the function using the circuit in Fig. 16.30(a). (a) Select
and ﬁnd L and C. (b) Select 
and ﬁnd L and C.
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is clearly and completely deﬁned. This
problem is what we call a synthesis problem: Given a transfer
function, synthesize a circuit that produces the given transfer
function. However, to keep the problem more manageable, we
give a circuit that produces the desired transfer function.
Had one of the variables, R in this case, not been given a value,
then the problem would have had an inﬁnite number of answers.
An open-ended problem of this kind would require some additional
assumptions that would have narrowed the set of solutions.
2. Present. A transfer function of the voltage out versus the voltage
in is equal to 
A circuit, Fig. 16.30, is also
given that should be able to produce the required transfer function.
Two different values of R, 
and 
are to be used to calculate
the values of L and C that produce the given transfer function.
3. Alternative. All solution paths involve determining the transfer
function of Fig. 16.30 and then matching the various terms of
the transfer function. Two approaches would be to use mesh
analysis or nodal analysis. Since we are looking for a ratio of
voltages, nodal analysis makes the most sense.
4. Attempt. Using nodal analysis leads to
Now multiply through by sLR:

Solving for the transfer function by using mesh analysis seems
the most straightforward and the approach we could use here.
However, it should be pointed out that this is mathematically
more complex and will take longer than the original nodal
analysis approach. Other approaches also exist. We can assume
an input for 
and, using either nodal analysis
or mesh analysis, see if we get the same answer we would get
with just using the transfer function. That is the approach we
will try using mesh analysis.

To synthesize the given transfer function T(s), compare it with the one
in Eq. (16.16.5). Notice two things: (1)

the numerator of T(s) is constant; (2) the given transfer function is
second-order, which implies that we must have two capacitors.

Summary
1. The Laplace transform can be used to analyze a circuit. We con-
vert each element from the time domain to the s-domain, solve the
problem using any circuit analysis technique, and convert the result
to the time domain using the inverse transform.
2. In the s-domain, the circuit elements are replaced with the initial
condition at 
as follows. (Please note, voltage models are
t  0
16.7

given below, but the corresponding current models work equally
well.):
3. Using the Laplace transform to analyze a circuit results in a com-
plete (both transient and steady state) response because the initial
conditions are incorporated in the transformation process.
4. The transfer function H(s) of a network is the Laplace transform
of the impulse response h(t).
5. In the s-domain, the transfer function H(s) relates the output
response Y(s) and an input excitation X(s); that is, 
6. The state variable model is a useful tool for analyzing complex
systems with several inputs and outputs. State variable analysis is
a powerful technique that is most popularly used in circuit theory
and control. The state of a system is the smallest set of quantities
(known as state variables) that we must know in order to deter-
mine its future response to any given input. The state equation in
state variable form is 
while the output equation is
7. For an electric circuit, we ﬁrst select capacitor voltages and induc-
tor current as state variables. We then apply KCL and KVL to
obtain the state equations.
8. Two other areas of applications of the Laplace transform covered
in this chapter are circuit stability and synthesis. A circuit is sta-
ble when all the poles of its transfer function lie in the left half of
the s plane. Network synthesis is the process of obtaining an appro-
priate network to represent a given transfer function for which
analysis in the s-domain is well suited.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.j), “a knowledge of contemporary
issues.”
Engineers must have knowledge of contemporary issues. To have a truly
meaningful career in the twenty-ﬁrst century, you must have knowl-
edge of contemporary issues, especially those that may directly affect
your job and/or work. One of the easiest ways to achieve this is to read
a lot—newspapers, magazines, and contemporary books. As a student
enrolled in an ABET-accredited program, some of the courses you take
will be directed toward meeting this criteria.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.k), “an ability to use the techniques,
skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for
engineering practice.”
The successful engineer must have the “ability to use the techniques,
skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.”
Clearly, a major focus of this textbook is to do just that. Learning to
use skillfully the tools that facilitate your working in a modern “knowl-
edge capturing integrated design environment” (KCIDE) is fundamen-
tal to your performance as an engineer. The ability to work in a modern
KCIDE environment requires a thorough understanding of the tools
associated with that environment. 
The successful engineer, therefore, must keep abreast of the new
design, analysis, and simulation tools. That engineer must also use
those tools until he or she is comfortable with using them. The engineer
also must make sure software results are consistent with real-world
actualities. It is probably in this area that most engineers have the great-
est difﬁculty. Thus, successful use of these tools requires constant
learning and relearning the fundamentals of the area in which the engi-
neer is working.

Introduction
We have spent a considerable amount of time on the analysis of circuits
with sinusoidal sources. This chapter is concerned with a means of ana-
lyzing circuits with periodic, nonsinusoidal excitations. The notion of
periodic functions was introduced in Chapter 9; it was mentioned there
that the sinusoid is the most simple and useful periodic function. This
chapter introduces the Fourier series, a technique for expressing a peri-
odic function in terms of sinusoids. Once the source function is expressed
in terms of sinusoids, we can apply the phasor method to analyze circuits.
The Fourier series is named after Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier
(1768–1830). In 1822, Fourier’s genius came up with the insight that
any practical periodic function can be represented as a sum of sinu-
soids. Such a representation, along with the superposition theorem,
allows us to ﬁnd the response of circuits to arbitrary periodic inputs
using phasor techniques.
We begin with the trigonometric Fourier series. Later we consider
the exponential Fourier series. We then apply Fourier series in circuit
analysis. Finally, practical applications of Fourier series in spectrum
analyzers and ﬁlters are demonstrated.
Trigonometric Fourier Series
While studying heat ﬂow, Fourier discovered that a nonsinusoidal peri-
odic function can be expressed as an inﬁnite sum of sinusoidal func-
tions. Recall that a periodic function is one that repeats every T seconds.
In other words, a periodic function 
satisﬁes
(17.1)
where n is an integer and T is the period of the function.

Chapter 17
The Fourier Series
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830), a French mathemati-
cian, ﬁrst presented the series and transform that bear his name. Fourier’s
results were not enthusiastically received by the scientiﬁc world. He
could not even get his work published as a paper.
Born in Auxerre, France, Fourier was orphaned at age 8. He attended
a local military college run by Benedictine monks, where he demon-
strated great proﬁciency in mathematics. Like most of his contempo-
raries, Fourier was swept into the politics of the French Revolution.
He played an important role in Napoleon’s expeditions to Egypt in the
later 1790s. Due to his political involvement, he narrowly escaped
death twice.

A software package like Mathcad or
Maple can be used to evaluate the
Fourier coefﬁcients.
Historical note: Although Fourier
published his theorem in 1822, it was
P. G. L. Dirichlet (1805–1859) who later
supplied an acceptable proof of the
theorem.

The Fourier series of a periodic function f (t) is a representation that
resolves f (t) into a dc component and an ac component comprising
an inﬁnite series of harmonic sinusoids.
According to the Fourier theorem, any practical periodic func-
tion of frequency 
can be expressed as an inﬁnite sum of sine or
cosine functions that are integral multiples of 
Thus, 
can be
expressed as
(17.2)
or
(17.3)
where 
is called the fundamental frequency in radians per
second. The sinusoid 
or 
is called the nth harmonic
of 
; it is an odd harmonic if n is odd and an even harmonic if n
is even. Equation 17.3 is called the trigonometric Fourier series of
. The constants 
and 
are the Fourier coefﬁcients. The coef-
ﬁcient 
is the dc component or the average value of 
. (Recall
that sinusoids have zero average values.) The coefﬁcients 
and 
(for 
) are the amplitudes of the sinusoids in the ac component.

A function that can be represented by a Fourier series as in Eq. (17.3)

The Fourier Series

To evaluate 
we multiply both sides of Eq. (17.3) by 
and integrate over one period:
(17.7)
The integral containing 
is zero in view of Eq. (17.4b), while the
integral containing 
vanishes according to Eq. (17.4c). The integral
containing 
will be zero except when 
in which case it is T2,
according to Eqs. (17.4e) and (17.4g). Thus,
or
(17.8)
In a similar vein, we obtain 
by multiplying both sides of Eq. (17.3)
by 
and integrating over the period. The result is
(17.9)
Be aware that since 
is periodic, it may be more convenient to carry
the integrations above from 
to T2 or generally from 
to 
instead of 0 to T. The result will be the same.
An alternative form of Eq. (17.3) is the amplitude-phase form 
(17.10)
We can use Eqs. (9.11) and (9.12) to relate Eq. (17.3) to Eq. (17.10),
or we can apply the trigonometric identity
(17.11)

The Fourier Series
Thus, the Fourier analysis is also a mathematical tool for ﬁnding the
spectrum of a periodic signal. Section 17.6 will elaborate more on the
spectrum of a signal.
To evaluate the Fourier coefﬁcients 
and 
we often need
to apply the following integrals:
(17.15a)
(17.15b)
(17.15c)
(17.15d)
It is also useful to know the values of the cosine, sine, and exponen-
tial functions for integral multiples of

The frequency spectrum is also known
as the line spectrum in view of the

Our goal is to obtain the Fourier coefﬁcients 
and 
using
Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). First, we describe the waveform as
(17.1.2)
and 
Since 
Thus,
(17.1.3)
Using Eq. (17.8) along with Eq. (17.15a),
(17.1.4)
From Eq. (17.9) with the aid of Eq. (17.15b),
(17.1.5)
Substituting the Fourier coefﬁcients in Eqs. (17.1.3) to (17.1.5) into
Eq. (17.1.1) gives the Fourier series as
(17.1.6)
Since 
contains only the dc component and the sine terms with the
fundamental component and odd harmonics, it may be written as
(17.1.7)
By summing the terms one by one as demonstrated in Fig. 17.2,
we notice how superposition of the terms can evolve into the original
square. As more and more Fourier components are added, the sum gets
closer and closer to the square wave. However, it is not possible in
practice to sum the series in Eq. (17.1.6) or (17.1.7) to inﬁnity. Only
a partial sum (
, where N is ﬁnite) is possible. If we
plot the partial sum (or truncated series) over one period for a large N

as in Fig. 17.3, we notice that the partial sum oscillates above and
below the actual value of

discontinuity (

oscillation. In fact, an overshoot of about 9 percent of the peak value

Symmetry Considerations
We noticed that the Fourier series of Example 17.1 consisted only of
the sine terms. One may wonder if a method exists whereby one can
know in advance that some Fourier coefﬁcients would be zero and
avoid the unnecessary work involved in the tedious process of calcu-
lating them. Such a method does exist; it is based on recognizing the
existence of symmetry. Here we discuss three types of symmetry:
(1) even symmetry, (2) odd symmetry, (3) half-wave symmetry.
17.3.1
Even Symmetry
A function 
is even if its plot is symmetrical about the vertical axis;
that is,

Examples of even functions are 
and 
Figure 17.10 shows
more examples of periodic even functions. Note that each of these
examples satisﬁes Eq. (17.16). A main property of an even function
is that:
(17.17)
because integrating from 
to 0 is the same as integrating from 0
to 
. Utilizing this property, the Fourier coefﬁcients for an even func-
tion become
(17.18)
Since 
Eq. (17.3) becomes a Fourier cosine series. This makes
sense because the cosine function is itself even. It also makes intuitive
sense that an even function contains no sine terms since the sine func-
tion is odd.
To conﬁrm Eq. (17.18) quantitatively, we apply the property of an
even function in Eq. (17.17) in evaluating the Fourier coefﬁcients in
Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). It is convenient in each case to inte-
grate over the interval 
which is symmetrical about
the origin. Thus,
(17.19)
We change variables for the integral over the interval 
by letting 
so that 
since 
is
an even function, and when 
Then,

that both

is said to be odd if its plot is antisymmetrical about the
vertical axis:

Chapter 17
The Fourier Series

because integration from 
to 0 is the negative of that from 0 to
. With this property, the Fourier coefﬁcients for an odd function
become
(17.28)
which give us a Fourier sine series. Again, this makes sense because
the sine function is itself an odd function. Also, note that there is no
dc term for the Fourier series expansion of an odd function.
The quantitative proof of Eq. (17.28) follows the same procedure
taken to prove Eq. (17.18) except that 
is now odd, so that
With this fundamental but simple difference, it is easy
to see that 
in Eq. (17.20), 
in Eq. (17.23a), and 
in
Eq. (17.24) becomes
(17.29)
as expected.
It is interesting to note that any periodic function 
with neither
even nor odd symmetry may be decomposed into even and odd parts.
Using the properties of even and odd functions from Eqs. (17.16) and
(17.26), we can write
(17.30)
Notice that 
satisfies the property of an
even function in Eq. (17.16), while 
satisﬁes
the property of an odd function in Eq. (17.26). The fact that 
contains only the dc term and the cosine terms, while 
has only
the sine terms, can be exploited in grouping the Fourier series expan-
sion of 
as

Figure 17.12
Typical examples of half-wave odd symmetric functions.
Also, note the following properties of odd and even functions:
1. The product of two even functions is also an even function.
2. The product of two odd functions is an even function.
3. The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd
function.
4. The sum (or difference) of two even functions is also an even
function.
5. The sum (or difference) of two odd functions is an odd function.
6. The sum (or difference) of an even function and an odd function
is neither even nor odd.
Each of these properties can be proved using Eqs. (17.16) and (17.26).
17.3.3
Half-Wave Symmetry
A function is half-wave (odd) symmetric if
(17.32)
which means that each half-cycle is the mirror image of the next half-
cycle. Notice that functions 
and 
satisfy Eq. (17.32)
for odd values of n and therefore possess half-wave symmetry when n
is odd. Figure 17.12 shows other examples of half-wave symmetric
functions. The functions in Figs. 17.11(a) and 17.11(b) are also half-
wave symmetric. Notice that for each function, one half-cycle is the
inverted version of the adjacent half-cycle. The Fourier coefﬁcients
become

The Fourier Series

showing that the Fourier series of a half-wave symmetric function con-
tains only odd harmonics.
To derive Eq. (17.33), we apply the property of half-wave sym-
metric functions in Eq. (17.32) in evaluating the Fourier coefﬁcients in
Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). Thus,
(17.34)
We change variables for the integral over the interval 
by letting 
so that

Also, we keep Eq. (17.32) in mind; that is,
Then,
(17.35)
conﬁrming the expression for 
in Eq. (17.33). Similarly,
(17.36)
We make the same change of variables that led to Eq. (17.35) so that
Eq. (17.36) becomes
(17.37)
Since 
and
(17.38)
substituting these in Eq. (17.37) leads to
(17.39)
conﬁrming Eq. (17.33). By following a similar procedure, we can
derive 
as in Eq. (17.33). 
Table 17.2 summarizes the effects of these symmetries on the
Fourier coefﬁcients. Table 17.3 provides the Fourier series of some
common periodic functions.

Circuit Applications
We ﬁnd that in practice, many circuits are driven by nonsinusoidal peri-
odic functions. To ﬁnd the steady-state response of a circuit to a non-
sinusoidal periodic excitation requires the application of a Fourier
series, ac phasor analysis, and the superposition principle. The proce-
dure usually involves four steps.
17.4
Steps for Applying Fourier Series:
1. Express the excitation as a Fourier series.
2. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequency
domain.
3. Find the response of the dc and ac components in the Fourier
series.
4. Add the individual dc and ac responses using the superposition
principle.

The Fourier Series
The ﬁrst step is to determine the Fourier series expansion of the
excitation. For the periodic voltage source shown in Fig. 17.18(a), for
example, the Fourier series is expressed as
(17.40)
(The same could be done for a periodic current source.) Equation (17.40)
shows that v(t) consists of two parts: the dc component 
and the ac
component 
with several harmonics. This Fourier series rep-
resentation may be regarded as a set of series-connected sinusoidal
sources, with each source having its own amplitude and frequency, as
shown in Fig. 17.18(b).
The third step is ﬁnding the response to each term in the Fourier
series. The response to the dc component can be determined in the

Average Power and RMS Values
Recall the concepts of average power and rms value of a periodic sig-
nal that we discussed in Chapter 11. To ﬁnd the average power
absorbed by a circuit due to a periodic excitation, we write the voltage
and current in amplitude-phase form [see Eq. (17.10)] as
(17.42)
(17.43)
Following the passive sign convention (Fig. 17.25), the average
power is
(17.44)
Substituting Eqs. (17.42) and (17.43) into Eq. (17.44) gives
(17.45)
The second and third integrals vanish, since we are integrating the
cosine over its period. According to Eq. (17.4e), all terms in the
fourth integral are zero when 
By evaluating the ﬁrst integral
and applying Eq. (17.4g) to the fourth integral for the case 
we obtain
(17.46)
This shows that in average-power calculation involving periodic volt-
age and current, the total average power is the sum of the average pow-
ers in each harmonically related voltage and current.
Given a periodic function

Historical note: Named after the French

Deschemes (1755–1836).
Substituting 
in Eq. (17.10) into Eq. (17.47) and noting that
we obtain
(17.48)
Distinct integers n and m have been introduced to handle the prod-
uct of the two series summations. Using the same reasoning as
above, we get
or
(17.49)
In terms of Fourier coefﬁcients 
and 
Eq. (17.49) may be written as
(17.50)
If 
is the current through a resistor R, then the power dissipated in
the resistor is
(17.51)
Or if 
is the voltage across a resistor R, the power dissipated in the
resistor is
(17.52)
One can avoid specifying the nature of the signal by choosing a 
resistance. The power dissipated by the 
resistance is
(17.53)
This result is known as Parseval’s theorem. Notice that 
is the power
in the dc component, while 
is the ac power in the nth har-
monic. Thus, Parseval’s theorem states that the average power in a peri-
odic signal is the sum of the average power in its dc component and
the average powers in its harmonics.

Fourier Analysis with PSpice
Fourier analysis is usually performed with PSpice in conjunction with
transient analysis. Therefore, we must do a transient analysis in order
to perform a Fourier analysis.
To perform the Fourier analysis of a waveform, we need a circuit
whose input is the waveform and whose output is the Fourier decom-
position. A suitable circuit is a current (or voltage) source in series with
a 
resistor as shown in Fig. 17.33. The waveform is inputted as
using VPULSE for a pulse or VSIN for a sinusoid, and the attri-
butes of the waveform are set over its period T. The output V(1) from
node 1 is the dc level 
and the ﬁrst nine harmonics 
with their
corresponding phases 
that is,
(17.73)
where
(17.74)
Notice in Eq. (17.74) that the PSpice output is in the sine and angle form
rather than the cosine and angle form in Eq. (17.10). The PSpice output
also includes the normalized Fourier coefﬁcients. Each coefﬁcient 
is
normalized by dividing it by the magnitude of the fundamental 
so
that the normalized component is 
The corresponding phase 
is
normalized by subtracting from it the phase 
of the fundamental, so
that the normalized phase is 
.

program and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) performed by the PSpice
A/D program. While DFT is an approximation of the exponential Fourier
series, FTT is an algorithm for rapid efﬁcient numerical computation of
DFT. A full discussion of DFT and FTT is beyond the scope of this book.
17.7.1
Discrete Fourier Transform
A discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is performed by the PSpice pro-
gram, which tabulates the harmonics in an output ﬁle. To enable a
Fourier analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/Transient and bring up the
Transient dialog box, shown in Fig. 17.34. The Print Step should be a
small fraction of the period T, while the Final Time could be 6T. The
Center Frequency is the fundamental frequency 
The partic-
ular variable whose DFT is desired, V(1) in Fig. 17.34, is entered in
the Output Vars command box. In addition to ﬁlling in the Transient
dialog box, DCLICK Enable Fourier. With the Fourier analysis enabled
and the schematic saved, run PSpice by selecting Analysis/Simulate
as usual. The program executes a harmonic decomposition into Fourier
components of the result of the transient analysis. The results are sent
to an output ﬁle which can be retrieved by selecting Analysis/Examine
Output. The output ﬁle includes the dc value and the ﬁrst nine har-
monics by default, although you can specify more in the Number of
harmonics box (see Fig. 17.34).
17.7.2
Fast Fourier Transform
A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed by the PSpice A/D pro-
gram and displays as a PSpice A/D plot the complete spectrum of a
transient expression. As explained above, we ﬁrst construct the schematic
in Fig. 17.33(b) and enter the attributes of the waveform. We also need
to enter the Print Step and the Final Time in the Transient dialog box.
Once this is done, we can obtain the FFT of the waveform in two ways.
One way is to insert a voltage marker at node 1 in the schematic
of the circuit in Fig. 17.33(b). After saving the schematic and select-
ing Analysis/Simulate, the waveform V(1) will be displayed in the
PSpice A/D window. Double clicking the FFT icon in the PSpice A/D
menu will automatically replace the waveform with its FFT. From the
FFT-generated graph, we can obtain the harmonics. In case the FFT-
generated graph is crowded, we can use the User Deﬁned data range
(see Fig. 17.35) to specify a smaller range.

Example 17.12
Use PSpice to determine the Fourier coefﬁcients of the signal in Fig. 17.1.
Solution:
Figure 17.36 shows the schematic for obtaining the Fourier coefﬁcients.
With the signal in Fig. 17.1 in mind, we enter the attributes of the
voltage source VPULSE as shown in Fig. 17.36. We will solve this
example using both the DFT and FFT approaches.
■METHOD 1
DFT Approach: (The voltage marker in Fig. 17.36
is not needed for this method.) From Fig. 17.1, it is evident that 
So, in the transient dialog box, we select the Final Time as 
the Print Step as 0.01 s, the Step Ceiling as 10 ms, the Center
Frequency as 0.5 Hz, and the output variable as V(1). (In fact, Fig. 17.34
is for this particular example.) When PSpice is run, the output ﬁle
contains the following result:
6T  12 s,

Schematic for Example 17.12.
Another way of obtaining the FFT of V(1) is to not insert a volt-
age marker at node 1 in the schematic. After selecting Analysis/
Simulate, the PSpice A/D window will come up with no graph on it.
We select Trace/Add and type V(1) in the Trace Command box and
DCLICKL OK. We now select Plot/X-Axis Settings to bring up the
X-Axis Setting dialog box shown in Fig. 17.35 and then select
Fourier/OK. This will cause the FFT of the selected trace (or traces)
to be displayed. This second approach is useful for obtaining the FFT
of any trace associated with the circuit.
A major advantage of the FFT method is that it provides graphi-
cal output. But its major disadvantage is that some of the harmonics
may be too small to see.
In both DFT and FFT, we should let the simulation run for a large
number of cycles and use a small value of Step Ceiling (in the Transient
dialog box) to ensure accurate results. The Final Time in the Tran-
sient dialog box should be at least ﬁve times the period of the signal
to allow the simulation to reach steady state.

Comparing the result with that in Eq. (17.1.7) (see Example 17.1) or
with the spectra in Fig. 17.4 shows a close agreement. From Eq. (17.1.7),
the dc component is 0.5 while PSpice gives 0.498995. Also, the signal
has only odd harmonics with phase 
whereas PSpice seems
to indicate that the signal has even harmonics although the magnitudes
of the even harmonics are small.
■METHOD 2
FFT Approach: With voltage marker in Fig. 17.36
in place, we run PSpice and obtain the waveform V(1) shown in
Fig. 17.37(a) on the PSpice A/D window. By double clicking the FFT
icon in the PSpice A/D menu and changing the X-axis setting to 0 to
10 Hz, we obtain the FFT of V(1) as shown in Fig. 17.37(b). The FFT-
generated graph contains the dc and harmonic components within the
selected frequency range. Notice that the magnitudes and frequencies
of the harmonics agree with the DFT-generated tabulated values.

If 
in the circuit of Fig. 17.38, ﬁnd i(t).
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. Although the problem appears to be clearly stated, it
might be advisable to check with the individual who assigned
the problem to make sure he or she wants the transient response
rather than the steady-state response; in the latter case the
problem becomes trivial.
2. Present. We are to determine the response i(t) given the input
using PSpice and Fourier analysis.
3. Alternative. We will use DFT to perform the initial analysis. We
will then check using the FFT approach.
4. Attempt. The schematic is shown in Fig. 17.39. We may use the
DFT approach to obtain the Fourier coefﬁcents of i(t). Since the
period of the input waveform is 
in the
Transient dialog box we select Print Step: 0.1 ms, Final Time:

result. The current marker is inserted at pin 1 of the inductor as
shown in Fig. 17.39. Running PSpice will automatically produce

One ﬁnal observation, does the answer make sense? Let us
look at the actual transient response, 
The period of the cosine wave is
10 ms while the time constant of the exponential is 2000 ms
(2 seconds). So, the answer we obtained by Fourier techniques
does agree.

Applications
We demonstrated in Section 17.4 that the Fourier series expansion per-
mits the application of the phasor techniques used in ac analysis to cir-
cuits containing nonsinusoidal periodic excitations. The Fourier series
has many other practical applications, particularly in communications
and signal processing. Typical applications include spectrum analysis,
ﬁltering, rectiﬁcation, and harmonic distortion. We will consider two
of these: spectrum analyzers and ﬁlters.
17.8.1
Spectrum Analyzers
The Fourier series provides the spectrum of a signal. As we have seen,
the spectrum consists of the amplitudes and phases of the harmonics
versus frequency. By providing the spectrum of a signal 
, the
Fourier series helps us identify the pertinent features of the signal. It
demonstrates which frequencies are playing an important role in the
shape of the output and which ones are not. For example, audible
sounds have signiﬁcant components in the frequency range of 20 Hz
to 15 kHz, while visible light signals range from 
GHz to 
GHz.
Table 17.4 presents some other signals and the frequency ranges of
their components. A periodic function is said to be band-limited if its
amplitude spectrum contains only a ﬁnite number of coefﬁcients 
or
In this case, the Fourier series becomes
(17.75)
This shows that we need only 
terms (namely, 
to completely specify 
if 
is known. This leads
to the sampling theorem: a band-limited periodic function whose
Fourier series contains N harmonics is uniquely speciﬁed by its values
at 
instants in one period.
A spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the amplitude
of the components of a signal versus frequency. It shows the various
frequency components (spectral lines) that indicate the amount of
energy at each frequency.
It is unlike an oscilloscope, which displays the entire signal (all
components) versus time. An oscilloscope shows the signal in the time
domain, while the spectrum analyzer shows the signal in the frequency
domain. There is perhaps no instrument more useful to a circuit ana-
lyst than the spectrum analyzer. An analyzer can conduct noise and spu-
rious signal analysis, phase checks, electromagnetic interference and
ﬁlter examinations, vibration measurements, radar measurements, and
more. Spectrum analyzers are commercially available in various sizes
and shapes. Figure 17.42 displays a typical one.
17.8.2
Filters
Filters are an important component of electronics and communications
systems. Chapter 14 presented a full discussion on passive and active
ﬁlters. Here, we investigate how to design ﬁlters to select the funda-
mental component (or any desired harmonic) of the input signal and
reject other harmonics. This ﬁltering process cannot be accomplished

without the Fourier series expansion of the input signal. For the purpose
of illustration, we will consider two cases, a lowpass ﬁlter and a band-
pass ﬁlter. In Example 17.6, we already looked at a highpass RL ﬁlter.
The output of a lowpass ﬁlter depends on the input signal, the
transfer function 
of the ﬁlter, and the corner or half-power fre-
quency 
We recall that 
for an RC passive ﬁlter. As shown
in Fig. 17.43(a), the lowpass ﬁlter passes the dc and low-frequency com-
ponents, while blocking the high-frequency components. By making 
sufﬁciently large 
e.g., making C small), a large number of
the harmonics can be passed. On the other hand, by making 
sufﬁ-
ciently small 
we can block out all the ac components and
pass only dc, as shown typically in Fig. 17.43(b). (See Fig. 17.2(a) for
the Fourier series expansion of the square wave.)

Similarly, the output of a bandpass ﬁlter depends on the input signal,
the transfer function of the ﬁlter 
, its bandwidth B, and its center
frequency 
As illustrated in Fig. 17.44(a), the ﬁlter passes all the har-
monics of the input signal within a band of frequencies 
centered around 
We have assumed that 
and 
are within
that band. If the ﬁlter is made highly selective 
and 
where 
is the fundamental frequency of the input signal, the ﬁlter
passes only the fundamental component 
of the input and blocks
out all higher harmonics. As shown in Fig. 17.44(b), with a square wave
as input, we obtain a sine wave of the same frequency as the output.

Summary
1. A periodic function is one that repeats itself every T seconds; that
is, 
2. Any nonsinusoidal periodic function f(t) that we encounter in elec-
trical engineering can be expressed in terms of sinusoids using
Fourier series:
where 
is the fundamental frequency. The Fourier series
resolves the function into the dc component 
and an ac compo-
nent containing inﬁnitely many harmonically related sinusoids.
The Fourier coefﬁcients are determined as
If f(t) is an even function, 
and when f(t) is odd, 
and 
If f(t) is half-wave symmetric, 
for
even values of n.

4. Fourier series representation allows us to apply the phasor method
in analyzing circuits when the source function is a nonsinusoidal
periodic function. We use phasor technique to determine the
response of each harmonic in the series, transform the responses
to the time domain, and add them up.
5. The average-power of periodic voltage and current is 
In other words, the total average power is the sum of the average
powers in each harmonically related voltage and current.
6. A periodic function can also be represented in terms of an expo-
nential (or complex) Fourier series as
where
and 
The exponential form describes the spectrum of
f(t) in terms of the amplitude and phase of ac components at pos-
itive and negative harmonic frequencies. Thus, there are three basic
forms of Fourier series representation: the trigonometric form, the
amplitude-phase form, and the exponential form.
7. The frequency (or line) spectrum is the plot of 
and 
or 
and
versus frequency. 
8. The rms value of a periodic function is given by
The power dissipated by a 
resistance is
This relationship is known as Parseval’s theorem.
9. Using PSpice, a Fourier analysis of a circuit can be performed in
conjunction with the transient analysis.
10. Fourier series ﬁnd application in spectrum analyzers and ﬁlters.
The spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the discrete
Fourier spectra of an input signal, so that an analyst can determine
the frequencies and relative energies of the signal’s components.
Because the Fourier spectra are discrete spectra, ﬁlters can be
designed for great effectiveness in blocking frequency components
of a signal that are outside a desired range.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Career in Communications Systems
Communications systems apply the principles of circuit analysis. A
communication system is designed to convey information from a
source (the transmitter) to a destination (the receiver) via a channel (the
propagation medium). Communications engineers design systems for
transmitting and receiving information. The information can be in the
form of voice, data, or video.
We live in the information age—news, weather, sports, shopping,
financial, business inventory, and other sources make information avail-
able to us almost instantly via communications systems. Some obvious
examples of communications systems are the telephone network,
mobile cellular telephones, radio, cable TV, satellite TV, fax, and radar.
Mobile radio, used by police and ﬁre departments, aircraft, and vari-
ous businesses is another example.
The ﬁeld of communications is perhaps the fastest growing area in
electrical engineering. The merging of the communications ﬁeld with
computer technology in recent years has led to digital data communica-
tions networks such as local area networks, metropolitan area networks,
and broadband integrated services digital networks. For example, the
Internet (the “information superhighway”) allows educators, business
people, and others to send electronic mail from their computers world-
wide, log onto remote databases, and transfer ﬁles. The Internet has hit
the world like a tidal wave and is drastically changing the way people do
business, communicate, and get information. This trend will continue.
A communications engineer designs systems that provide high-
quality information services. The systems include hardware for generating,
transmitting, and receiving information signals. Communications engineers
are employed in numerous communications industries and places where
communications systems are routinely used. More and more government
agencies, academic departments, and businesses are demanding faster and
more accurate transmission of information. To meet these needs, commu-
nications engineers are in high demand. Therefore, the future is in com-
munications and every electrical engineer must prepare accordingly.

Introduction
Fourier series enable us to represent a periodic function as a sum of
sinusoids and to obtain the frequency spectrum from the series. The
Fourier transform allows us to extend the concept of a frequency spec-
trum to nonperiodic functions. The transform assumes that a nonperi-
odic function is a periodic function with an inﬁnite period. Thus, the
Fourier transform is an integral representation of a nonperiodic func-
tion that is analogous to a Fourier series representation of a periodic
function.
The Fourier transform is an integral transform like the Laplace
transform. It transforms a function in the time domain into the fre-
quency domain. The Fourier transform is very useful in communica-
tions systems and digital signal processing, in situations where the
Laplace transform does not apply. While the Laplace transform can
only handle circuits with inputs for 
with initial conditions, the
Fourier transform can handle circuits with inputs for 
as well as
those for 
We begin by using a Fourier series as a stepping stone in deﬁning
the Fourier transform. Then we develop some of the properties of the
Fourier transform. Next, we apply the Fourier transform in analyzing
circuits. We discuss Parseval’s theorem, compare the Laplace and
Fourier transforms, and see how the Fourier transform is applied in
amplitude modulation and sampling.
Deﬁnition of the Fourier Transform
We saw in the previous chapter that a nonsinusoidal periodic function
can be represented by a Fourier series, provided that it satisﬁes the
Dirichlet conditions. What happens if a function is not periodic? Unfor-
tunately, there are many important nonperiodic functions—such as a
unit step or an exponential function—that we cannot represent by a
Fourier series. As we shall see, the Fourier transform allows a trans-
formation from the time to the frequency domain, even if the function
is not periodic.
Suppose we want to ﬁnd the Fourier transform of a nonperiodic
function p(t), shown in Fig. 18.1(a). We consider a periodic function
f(t) whose shape over one period is the same as p(t), as shown in
Fig. 18.1(b). If we let the period 
only a single pulse of width
[the desired nonperiodic function in Fig. 18.1(a)] remains, because
the adjacent pulses have been moved to inﬁnity. Thus, the function
f(t) is no longer periodic. In other words, 
as 
It is
interesting to consider the spectrum of f(t) for 
and 
(see Section 17.6). Figure 18.2 shows the effect of increasing T
on the spectrum. First, we notice that the general shape of the
spectrum remains the same, and the frequency at which the envelope
ﬁrst becomes zero remains the same. However, the amplitude of the
spectrum and the spacing between adjacent components both
decrease, while the number of harmonics increases. Thus, over a
range of frequencies, the sum of the amplitudes of the harmonics
remains almost constant. As the total “strength” or energy of the

increases, f or

becomes continuous.

tion and its periodic counterpart, consider the exponential form of a

The Fourier transform is an integral transformation of f (t) from the time
domain to the frequency domain.
Substituting Eq. (18.2) into Eq. (18.1) gives

Properties of the Fourier Transform
We now develop some properties of the Fourier transform that are use-
ful in ﬁnding the transforms of complicated functions from the trans-
forms of simple functions. For each property, we will ﬁrst state and
derive it, and then illustrate it with some examples.
Linearity
If 
and 
are the Fourier transforms of 
and 
respec-
tively, then
(18.12)
where 
and 
are constants. This property simply states that the
Fourier transform of a linear combination of functions is the same as
the linear combination of the transforms of the individual functions.
The proof of the linearity property in Eq. (18.12) is straightforward.

Using the linearity
property,

compression (
) implies frequency expansion. The proof of the
time-scaling property proceeds as follows.
(18.16)
If we let 
so that 
then
(18.17)
For example, for the rectangular pulse p(t) in Example 18.2,
(18.18a)
Using Eq. (18.15),
(18.18b)
It may be helpful to plot p(t) and 
and their Fourier transforms.
Since
(18.19a)
then replacing every t with 
gives
(18.19b)
showing that 
is time compressed, as shown in Fig. 18.9(b). To
plot both Fourier transforms in Eq. (18.18), we recall that the sinc
function has zeros when its argument is 
where n is an integer.
Hence, for the transform of p(t) in Eq. (18.18a), 
and for the transform of 
in Eq. (18.18b), 
The plots of the Fourier transforms are
shown in Fig. 18.9, which shows that time compression corresponds
with frequency expansion. We should expect this intuitively, because
when the signal is squashed in time, we expect it to change more
rapidly, thereby causing higher-frequency components to exist.
Time Shifting
If 
then
(18.20)
that is, a delay in the time domain corresponds to a phase shift in the
frequency domain. To derive the time shifting property, we note that

Taking the Fourier transforms of the ﬁrst and last terms, we obtain
(18.33)
which agrees with the result in Example 18.3.
Time Integration
Given that 
then
(18.34)
that is, the transform of the integral of f(t) is obtained by dividing the
transform of f(t) by 
and adding the result to the impulse term that
reﬂects the dc component 
Someone might ask, “How do we know
that when we take the Fourier transform for time integration, we should
integrate over the interval 
and not 
?” When we inte-
grate over 
the result does not depend on time anymore, and
the Fourier transform of a constant is what we will eventually get. But
when we integrate over 
we get the integral of the function
from the past to time t, so that the result depends on t and we can take
the Fourier transform of that.
If 
is replaced by 0 in Eq. (18.8),
(18.35)
indicating that the dc component is zero when the integral of f(t) over
all time vanishes. The proof of the time integration in Eq. (18.34) will
be given later when we consider the convolution property.
For example, we know that 
and that integrating the
impulse function gives the unit step function [see Eq. (7.39a)]. By
applying the property in Eq. (18.34), we obtain the Fourier transform
of the unit step function as

Reversal
If 
then

that reversing f(t) about the time axis reverses 
about the frequency
axis. This may be regarded as a special case of time scaling for which

Duality
This property states that if

the Fourier transform of F(t) is 
; we write

This expresses the symmetry property of the Fourier transform. To
derive this property, we recall that

If we interchange t and

transform in the analysis of linear
systems.
If

as expected. This result expands the phasor method beyond what was
done with the Fourier series in the previous chapter.
To illustrate the convolution property, suppose both h(t) and
x(t) are identical rectangular pulses, as shown in Fig. 18.12(a) and
18.12(b). We recall from Example 18.2 and Fig. 18.5 that the Fourier
transforms of the rectangular pulses are sinc functions, as shown in
Fig. 18.12(c) and 18.12(d). According to the convolution property,
the product of the sinc functions should give us the convolution of
the rectangular pulses in the time domain. Thus, the convolution
of the pulses in Fig. 18.12(e) and the product of the sinc functions
in Fig. 18.12(f) form a Fourier pair.
In view of the duality property, we expect that if convolution in
the time domain corresponds with multiplication in the frequency

which is convolution in the frequency domain. The proof of Eq. (18.48)
readily follows from the duality property in Eq. (18.38).
Let us now derive the time integration property in Eq. (18.34). If
we replace x(t) with the unit step function 
and h(t) with f(t) in
Eq. (18.43), then
(18.49)
But by the deﬁnition of the unit step function,
We can write this as
Substituting this into Eq. (18.49) makes the interval of integration
change from 
to 
and thus Eq. (18.49) becomes
Taking the Fourier transform of both sides yields
(18.50)
But from Eq. (18.36), the Fourier transform of the unit step function is
Substituting this into Eq. (18.50) gives
(18.51)
which is the time integration property of Eq. (18.34). Note that in
Eq. (18.51), 
since 
is only nonzero at

Fourier Transform

Circuit Applications
The Fourier transform generalizes the phasor technique to nonperiodic
functions. Therefore, we apply Fourier transforms to circuits with non-
sinusoidal excitations in exactly the same way we apply phasor techniques
to circuits with sinusoidal excitations. Thus, Ohm’s law is still valid:
(18.52)
where 
and 
are the Fourier transforms of the voltage and cur-
rent and 
is the impedance. We get the same expressions for the
impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors as in phasor analy-
sis, namely,
(18.53)
Once we transform the functions for the circuit elements into the fre-
quency domain and take the Fourier transforms of the excitations, we
can use circuit techniques such as voltage division, source transforma-
tion, mesh analysis, node analysis, or Thevenin’s theorem, to ﬁnd the
unknown response (current or voltage). Finally, we take the inverse
Fourier transform to obtain the response in the time domain.
Although the Fourier transform method produces a response that
exists for 
Fourier analysis cannot handle circuits with
initial conditions.
The transfer function is again deﬁned as the ratio of the output
response 
to the input excitation 
; that is,

Parseval’s Theorem
Parseval’s theorem demonstrates one practical use of the Fourier trans-
form. It relates the energy carried by a signal to the Fourier transform of
the signal. If p(t) is the power associated with the signal, the energy car-
ried by the signal is
(18.57)
In order to be able to compare the energy content of current and volt-
age signals, it is convenient to use a 
resistor as the base for energy
calculation. For a 
resistor, 
where f(t)
stands for either voltage or current. The energy delivered to the 
resistor is

energy dissipated in the resistor.
Solution:
1. Deﬁne. The problem is well deﬁned and clearly stated.
2. Present. We are given the voltage across the resistor for all time
and are asked to ﬁnd the energy dissipated by the resistor. We note
that the voltage is zero for all time less than zero. Thus, we only
need to consider the time from zero to inﬁnity.
3. Alternative. There are basically two ways to ﬁnd this answer.
The ﬁrst would be to ﬁnd the answer in the time domain. We
will use the second approach to ﬁnd the answer using Fourier
analysis.

odic functions. Parseval’s theorem for periodic functions was presented
in Sections 17.5 and 17.6. As evident in Eq. (18.63), Parseval’s theo-
rem shows that the energy associated with a nonperiodic signal
is spread over the entire frequency spectrum, whereas the energy of
a periodic signal is concentrated at the frequencies of its harmonic
components.

Comparing the Fourier and 
Laplace Transforms
It is worthwhile to take some moments to compare the Laplace and
Fourier transforms. The following similarities and differences should
be noted:
1. The Laplace transform deﬁned in Chapter 15 is one-sided in that
the integral is over 
making it only useful for positive-
time functions, f(t), 
The Fourier transform is applicable to
functions deﬁned for all time.
2. For a function f(t) that is nonzero for positive time only (i.e.,
) and 
the two transforms are
related by
(18.66)
This equation also shows that the Fourier transform can be
regarded as a special case of the Laplace transform with 
Recall that 
Therefore, Eq. (18.66) shows that the
Laplace transform is related to the entire s plane, whereas the
Fourier transform is restricted to the 
axis. See Fig. 15.1.
3. The Laplace transform is applicable to a wider range of functions
than the Fourier transform. For example, the function tu(t) has a
Laplace transform but no Fourier transform. But Fourier trans-
forms exist for signals that are not physically realizable and have
no Laplace transforms.
4. The Laplace transform is better suited for the analysis of transient
problems involving initial conditions, since it permits the inclusion
of the initial conditions, whereas the Fourier transform does not.
The Fourier transform is especially useful for problems in the
steady state.
5. The Fourier transform provides greater insight into the frequency
characteristics of signals than does the Laplace transform.
Some of the similarities and differences can be observed by compar-
ing Tables 15.1 and 15.2 with Tables 18.1 and 18.2.

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a process whereby the amplitude of
the carrier is controlled by the modulating signal.
Applications
Besides its usefulness for circuit analysis, the Fourier transform is used
extensively in a variety of ﬁelds such as optics, spectroscopy, acoustics,
computer science, and electrical engineering. In electrical engineering,
it is applied in communications systems and signal processing, where
frequency response and frequency spectra are vital. Here we consider
two simple applications: amplitude modulation (AM) and sampling.
18.7.1
Amplitude Modulation
Electromagnetic radiation or transmission of information through
space has become an indispensable part of a modern technological
society. However, transmission through space is only efﬁcient and
economical at high frequencies (above 20 kHz). To transmit intelli-
gent signals—such as for speech and music—contained in the low-
frequency range of 50 Hz to 20 kHz is expensive; it requires a huge
amount of power and large antennas. A common method of trans-
mitting low-frequency audio information is to transmit a high-frequency
signal, called a carrier, which is controlled in some way to corre-
spond to the audio information. Three characteristics (amplitude, fre-
quency, or phase) of a carrier can be controlled so as to allow it to
carry the intelligent signal, called the modulating signal. Here we will
only consider the control of the carrier’s amplitude. This is known as
amplitude modulation.

Chapter 18

AM is used in ordinary commercial radio bands and the video portion
of commercial television.
Suppose the audio information, such as voice or music (or the
modulating signal in general) to be transmitted is 
while the high-frequency carrier is 
where 
Then an AM signal f(t) is given by
(18.67)
Figure 18.22 illustrates the modulating signal 
the carrier 
and
the AM signal f(t). We can use the result in Eq. (18.27) together with the
Fourier transform of the cosine function (see Example 18.1 or Table 18.1)
to determine the spectrum of the AM signal:

where 
is the Fourier transform of the modulating signal 
Shown in Fig. 18.23 is the frequency spectrum of the AM signal. Fig-
ure 18.23 indicates that the AM signal consists of the carrier and two
other sinusoids. The sinusoid with frequency 
is known as the
lower sideband, while the one with frequency 
is known as
the upper sideband.

signal, (c) AM signal.
Notice that we have assumed that the modulating signal is sinu-
soidal to make the analysis easy. In real life, m(t) is a nonsinusoidal,
band-limited signal—its frequency spectrum is within the range
between 0 and 
(i.e., the signal has an upper frequency
limit). Typically, 
for AM radio. If the frequency spectrum
of the modulating signal is as shown in Fig. 18.24(a), then the fre-
quency spectrum of the AM signal is shown in Fig. 18.24(b). Thus,
to avoid any interference, carriers for AM radio stations are spaced
10 kHz apart.
At the receiving end of the transmission, the audio informa-
tion is recovered from the modulated carrier by a process known as
demodulation.

Sampling
In analog systems, signals are processed in their entirety. However, in
modern digital systems, only samples of signals are required for pro-
cessing. This is possible as a result of the sampling theorem given in
Section 17.8.1. The sampling can be done by using a train of pulses or
impulses. We will use impulse sampling here.
Consider the continuous signal 
shown in Fig. 18.25(a). This
can be multiplied by a train of impulses 
shown in

is the

Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Never trouble another for what you can do yourself.
Never spend your money before you have it.
Never buy what you do not want because it is cheap.
Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst, and cold.
We seldom repent having eaten too little.
Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly.
How much pain the evils have cost us that have never happened!
Take things always by the smooth handle.
When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a hundred.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Education
While two thirds of all engineers work in private industry, some work
in academia and prepare students for engineering careers. The course
on circuit analysis you are studying is an important part of the prepa-
ration process. If you enjoy teaching others, you may want to consider
becoming an engineering educator.
Engineering professors work on state-of-the-art research projects,
teach courses at graduate and undergraduate levels, and provide services
to their professional societies and the community at large. They are
expected to make original contributions in their areas of specialty. This
requires a broad-based education in the fundamentals of electrical engi-
neering and a mastery of the skills necessary for communicating their
efforts to others.
If you like to do research, to work at the frontiers of engineering, to
make contributions to technological advancement, to invent, consult, and/
or teach, consider a career in engineering education. The best way to start
is by talking with your professors and beneﬁting from their experience.
A solid understanding of mathematics and physics at the under-
graduate level is vital to your success as an engineering professor. If
you are having difﬁculty in solving your engineering textbook prob-
lems, start correcting any weaknesses you have in your mathematics
and physics fundamentals.
Most universities these days require that engineering professors have
a doctor’s degree. In addition, some universities require that they be
actively involved in research leading to publications in reputable journals.

A two-port network is an electrical network with two separate ports
for input and output.
Thus, a two-port network has two terminal pairs acting as access points.
As shown in Fig. 19.1(b), the current entering one terminal of a pair
leaves the other terminal in the pair. Three-terminal devices such as
transistors can be conﬁgured into two-port networks.
Our study of two-port networks is for at least two reasons. First,
such networks are useful in communications, control systems, power
systems, and electronics. For example, they are used in electronics to
model transistors and to facilitate cascaded design. Second, knowing
the parameters of a two-port network enables us to treat it as a “black
box” when embedded within a larger network.
To characterize a two-port network requires that we relate the ter-
minal quantities 
, and 
in Fig. 19.1(b), out of which two are
independent. The various terms that relate these voltages and currents
are called parameters. Our goal in this chapter is to derive six sets of these
parameters. We will show the relationship between these parameters and
how two-port networks can be connected in series, parallel, or cascade.
As with op amps, we are only interested in the terminal behavior of the
circuits. And we will assume that the two-port circuits contain no inde-
pendent sources, although they can contain dependent sources. Finally,
we will apply some of the concepts developed in this chapter to the
analysis of transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder networks.
Impedance Parameters
Impedance and admittance parameters are commonly used in the syn-
thesis of ﬁlters. They are also useful in the design and analysis of
impedance-matching networks and power distribution networks. We

To prepare yourself for a career in engineering education, get as broad
an education as possible, because electrical engineering is changing rap-
idly and becoming interdisciplinary. Without doubt, engineering educa-
tion is a rewarding career. Professors get a sense of satisfaction and
fulﬁllment as they see their students graduate, become leaders in their
profession, and contribute signiﬁcantly to the betterment of humanity.
Introduction
A pair of terminals through which a current may enter or leave a net-
work is known as a port. Two-terminal devices or elements (such as
resistors, capacitors, and inductors) result in one-port networks. Most
of the circuits we have dealt with so far are two-terminal or one-port
circuits, represented in Fig. 19.1(a). We have considered the voltage
across or current through a single pair of terminals—such as the two
terminals of a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor. We have also stud-
ied four-terminal or two-port circuits involving op amps, transistors,
and transformers, as shown in Fig. 19.1(b). In general, a network may
have n ports. A port is an access to the network and consists of a pair
of terminals; the current entering one terminal leaves through the other
terminal so that the net current entering the port equals zero.
In this chapter, we are mainly concerned with two-port networks
(or, simply, two-ports).

discuss impedance parameters in this section and admittance parame-
ters in the next section.
A two-port network may be voltage-driven as in Fig. 19.2(a) or
current-driven as in Fig. 19.2(b). From either Fig. 19.2(a) or (b), the
terminal voltages can be related to the terminal currents as
(19.1)
or in matrix form as
(19.2)
where the 
terms are called the impedance parameters, or simply z
parameters, and have units of ohms.
The values of the parameters can be evaluated by setting 
(input port open-circuited) or 
(output port open-circuited). Thus,
(19.3)
Since the z parameters are obtained by open-circuiting the input or out-
put port, they are also called the open-circuit impedance parameters.
Speciﬁcally,
(19.4)
According to Eq. (19.3), we obtain 
and 
by connecting a
voltage 
(or a current source 
) to port 1 with port 2 open-circuited
as in Fig. 19.3(a) and ﬁnding

Similarly, we obtain 
and 
by connecting a voltage 
(or a cur-
rent source 
) to port 2 with port 1 open-circuited as in Fig. 19.3(b)
and ﬁnding 
and 
; we then get
(19.6)
The above procedure provides us with a means of calculating or mea-
suring the z parameters.
Sometimes 
and 
are called driving-point impedances, while
and 
are called transfer impedances. A driving-point impedance
is the input impedance of a two-terminal (one-port) device. Thus, 
is the input driving-point impedance with the output port open-
circuited, while 
is the output driving-point impedance with the input
port open-circuited.
When 
, the two-port network is said to be symmetrical.
This implies that the network has mirrorlike symmetry about some cen-
ter line; that is, a line can be found that divides the network into two
similar halves.
When the two-port network is linear and has no dependent sources,
the transfer impedances are equal (
), and the two-port is said
to be reciprocal. This means that if the points of excitation and response
are interchanged, the transfer impedances remain the same. As illus-
trated in Fig. 19.4, a two-port is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal volt-
age source at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port gives the
same ammeter reading. The reciprocal network yields 
accord-
ing to Eq. (19.1) when connected as in Fig. 19.4(a), but yields 
when connected as in Fig. 19.4(b). This is possible only if 
.
Any two-port that is made entirely of resistors, capacitors, and induc-
tors must be reciprocal. A reciprocal network can be replaced by the
T-equivalent circuit in Fig. 19.5(a). If the network is not reciprocal, a
more general equivalent network is shown in Fig. 19.5(b); notice that
this ﬁgure follows directly from Eq. (19.1).

It should be mentioned that for some two-port networks, the z
parameters do not exist because they cannot be described by Eq. (19.1).
As an example, consider the ideal transformer of Fig. 19.6. The deﬁn-
ing equations for the two-port network are:

Observe that it is impossible to express the voltages in terms of the
currents, and vice versa, as Eq. (19.1) requires. Thus, the ideal trans-
former has no z parameters. However, it does have hybrid parameters,
as we shall see in Section 19.4.

given z parameters into Eq. (19.1),
(19.2.1)

Admittance Parameters
In the previous section we saw that impedance parameters may not
exist for a two-port network. So there is a need for an alternative means
of describing such a network. This need may be met by the second set
of parameters, which we obtain by expressing the terminal currents in
terms of the terminal voltages. In either Fig. 19.12(a) or (b), the ter-
minal currents can be expressed in terms of the terminal voltages as
(19.8)
or in matrix form as
(19.9)
The 
terms are known as the admittance parameters (or, simply, y
parameters) and have units of siemens.
The values of the parameters can be determined by setting 
(input port short-circuited) or 
(output port short-circuited). Thus,
(19.10)
Since the y parameters are obtained by short-circuiting the input or out-
put port, they are also called the short-circuit admittance parameters.
Speciﬁcally,
(19.11)
Following Eq. (19.10), we obtain 
and 
by connecting a cur-
rent 
to port 1 and short-circuiting port 2 as in Fig. 19.12(a), ﬁnding
and 
, and then calculating
(19.12)
Similarly, we obtain 
and 
by connecting a current source 
to
port 2 and short-circuiting port 1 as in Fig. 19.12(b), ﬁnding 
and 
and then getting
(19.13)
This procedure provides us with a means of calculating or measuring
the y parameters. The impedance and admittance parameters are col-
lectively referred to as immittance parameters.

The 
terms are known as the hybrid parameters (or, simply, h
parameters) because they are a hybrid combination of ratios. They
are very useful for describing electronic devices such as transistors
(see Section 19.9); it is much easier to measure experimentally the h
parameters of such devices than to measure their z or y parameters.
In fact, we have seen that the ideal transformer in Fig. 19.6, described

be described by the hybrid parameters, because Eq. (19.7) conforms
with Eq. (19.14).
The values of the parameters are determined as
(19.16)
It is evident from Eq. (19.16) that the parameters 
, and 
represent an impedance, a voltage gain, a current gain, and an admit-
tance, respectively. This is why they are called the hybrid parameters.
To be speciﬁc,
(19.17)
The procedure for calculating the h parameters is similar to that used
for the z or y parameters. We apply a voltage or current source to the
appropriate port, short-circuit or open-circuit the other port, depending
on the parameter of interest, and perform regular circuit analysis. For
reciprocal networks, 
. This can be proved in the same way
as we proved that 
. Figure 19.20 shows the hybrid model of
a two-port network.
A set of parameters closely related to the h parameters are the g
parameters or inverse hybrid parameters. These are used to describe
the terminal currents and voltages as

Another set of parameters relates the variables at the input port to those
at the output port. Thus,
(19.22)
or
(19.23)
Equations (19.22) and (19.23) relate the input variables (
and 
) to
the output variables (
and 
). Notice that in computing the trans-
mission parameters, 
is used rather than 
, because the current is
considered to be leaving the network, as shown in Fig. 19.31, as
opposed to entering the network as in Fig. 19.1(b). This is done merely
for conventional reasons; when you cascade two-ports (output to input),
it is most logical to think of 
as leaving the two-port. It is also cus-
tomary in the power industry to consider 
as leaving the two-port.
The two-port parameters in Eqs. (19.22) and (19.23) provide a
measure of how a circuit transmits voltage and current from a source
to a load. They are useful in the analysis of transmission lines (such
as cable and ﬁber) because they express sending-end variables (
and
) in terms of the receiving-end variables (
and 
). For this rea-
son, they are called transmission parameters. They are also known as
ABCD parameters. They are used in the design of telephone systems,
microwave networks, and radars.
The transmission parameters are determined as
(19.24)
Thus, the transmission parameters are called, speciﬁcally,
(19.25)
A and D are dimensionless, B is in ohms, and C is in siemens. Since
the transmission parameters provide a direct relationship between input
and output variables, they are very useful in cascaded networks.
Our last set of parameters may be deﬁned by expressing the
variables at the output port in terms of the variables at the input port.
We obtain

Relationships Between Parameters
Since the six sets of parameters relate the same input and output ter-
minal variables of the same two-port network, they should be interre-
lated. If two sets of parameters exist, we can relate one set to the other
set. Let us demonstrate the process with two examples.
Given the z parameters, let us obtain the y parameters. From
Eq. (19.2),
(19.31)
or

matrix is
and its determinant is
Substituting these into Eq. (19.34), we get

Two-Port Networks

Interconnection of Networks
A large, complex network may be divided into subnetworks for the pur-
poses of analysis and design. The subnetworks are modeled as two-
port networks, interconnected to form the original network. The
two-port networks may therefore be regarded as building blocks that
can be interconnected to form a complex network. The interconnection
can be in series, in parallel, or in cascade. Although the interconnected
network can be described by any of the six parameter sets, a certain
set of parameters may have a deﬁnite advantage. For example, when
the networks are in series, their individual z parameters add up to give
the z parameters of the larger network. When they are in parallel, their
individual y parameters add up to give the y parameters of the larger
network. When they are cascaded, their individual transmission param-
eters can be multiplied together to get the transmission parameters of
the larger network.

Figure 19.39
Series connection of two two-port
networks.
Consider the series connection of two two-port networks shown in
Fig. 19.39. The networks are regarded as being in series because their
input currents are the same and their voltages add. In addition, each
network has a common reference, and when the circuits are placed in
series, the common reference points of each circuit are connected
together. For network 
(19.44)
and for network 
(19.45)
We notice from Fig. 19.39 that
(19.46)
and that
(19.47)
Thus, the z parameters for the overall network are
(19.48)
or
(19.49)
showing that the z parameters for the overall network are the sum of
the z parameters for the individual networks. This can be extended to
n networks in series. If two two-port networks in the 
model, for
example, are connected in series, we use Table 19.1 to convert the 
to 
and then apply Eq. (19.49). We ﬁnally convert the result back to
using Table 19.1.
Two two-port networks are in parallel when their port voltages are
equal and the port currents of the larger network are the sums of the
individual port currents. In addition, each circuit must have a common
reference and when the networks are connected together, they must all
have their common references tied together. The parallel connection of
two two-port networks is shown in Fig. 19.40. For the two networks,

Two-Port Networks

Substituting Eqs. (19.50) and (19.51) into Eq. (19.52b) yields
(19.53)
Thus, the y parameters for the overall network are
(19.54)
or
(19.55)
showing that the y parameters of the overall network are the sum of
the y parameters of the individual networks. The result can be extended
to n two-port networks in parallel.
Two networks are said to be cascaded when the output of one is
the input of the other. The connection of two two-port networks in cas-
cade is shown in Fig. 19.41. For the two networks,

(19.57)
From Fig. 19.41,
(19.58)
Substituting these into Eqs. (19.56) and (19.57),

Thus, the transmission parameters for the overall network are the product
of the transmission parameters for the individual transmission parameters:

Computing Two-Port Parameters
Using PSpice
Hand calculation of the two-port parameters may become difﬁcult
when the two-port is complicated. We resort to PSpice in such situa-
tions. If the circuit is purely resistive, PSpice dc analysis may be used;
otherwise, PSpice ac analysis is required at a speciﬁc frequency. The
key to using PSpice in computing a particular two-port parameter is to
remember how that parameter is deﬁned and to constrain the appro-
priate port variable with a 1-A or 1-V source while using an open or
short circuit to impose the other necessary constraints. The following
two examples illustrate the idea.

Two-Port Networks
Applications
We have seen how the six sets of network parameters can be used to
characterize a wide range of two-port networks. Depending on the way
two-ports are interconnected to form a larger network, a particular
set of parameters may have advantages over others, as we noticed in
Section 19.7. In this section, we will consider two important application
areas of two-port parameters: transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder
networks.
19.9.1
Transistor Circuits
The two-port network is often used to isolate a load from the excita-
tion of a circuit. For example, the two-port in Fig. 19.55 may repre-
sent an ampliﬁer, a ﬁlter, or some other network. When the two-port
represents an ampliﬁer, expressions for the voltage gain 
the current
gain 
the input impedance 
and the output impedance 
can be
derived with ease. They are deﬁned as follows:
(19.62)
(19.63)
(19.64)
(19.65)
Any of the six sets of two-port parameters can be used to derive the
expressions in Eqs. (19.62) to (19.65). However, the hybrid (h) param-
eters are the most useful for transistors; they are easily measured and
are often provided in the manufacturer’s data or spec sheets for tran-
sistors. The h parameters provide a quick estimate of the performance
of transistor circuits. They are used for ﬁnding the exact voltage gain,
input impedance, and output impedance of a transistor.

Common emitter ampliﬁer: (a) circuit schematic, (b) hybrid model.
The h parameters for transistors have speciﬁc meanings expressed
by their subscripts. They are listed by the ﬁrst subscript and related to
the general h parameters as follows:
(19.66)
The subscripts i, r, f, and o stand for input, reverse, forward, and output.
The second subscript speciﬁes the type of connection used: e for com-
mon emitter (CE), c for common collector (CC), and b for common base
(CB). Here we are mainly concerned with the common-emitter connec-
tion. Thus, the four h parameters for the common-emitter ampliﬁer are:
(19.67)
These are calculated or measured in the same way as the general h
parameters. Typical values are 
We must keep in mind that these values represent ac
characteristics of the transistor, measured under speciﬁc circumstances.
Figure 19.56 shows the circuit schematic for the common-emitter
ampliﬁer and the equivalent hybrid model. From the ﬁgure, we see that

Consider the transistor ampliﬁer connected to an ac source and a
load as in Fig. 19.57. This is an example of a two-port network embed-
ded within a larger network. We can analyze the hybrid equivalent circuit
as usual with Eq. (19.68) in mind. (See Example 19.6.) Recognizing

from Fig. 19.57 that

Solution:
1. Deﬁne. In an initial look at this problem, it appears to be clearly
stated. However, when we are asked to determine the input
impedance and the voltage gain, do they refer to the transistor or
the circuit? As far as the current gain and the output impedance
are concerned, they are the same for both cases.
We ask for clariﬁcation and are told that we should calculate
the input impedance, the output impedance, and the voltage gain

for the circuit and not the transistor. It is interesting to note that
the problem can be restated so that it becomes a simple design
problem: Given the h parameters, design a simple ampliﬁer that
has a gain of 
2. Present. Given a simple transistor circuit, an input voltage of 3.2 mV,
and the h parameters of the transistor, calculate the output voltage.
3. Alternative. There are a couple of ways we can approach the
problem, the most straightforward being to use the equivalent
circuit shown in Fig. 19.57. Once you have the equivalent circuit
you can use circuit analysis to determine the answer. Once you
have a solution, you can check it by plugging in the answer into
the circuit equations to see if they are correct. Another approach
is to simplify the right-hand side of the equivalent circuit and
work backward to see if you obtain approximately the same
answer. We will use that approach here.
4. Attempt. We note that

Ladder Network Synthesis
Another application of two-port parameters is the synthesis (or build-
ing) of ladder networks, which are found frequently in practice and

have particular use in designing passive lowpass ﬁlters. Based on our
discussion of second-order circuits in Chapter 8, the order of the ﬁl-
ter is the order of the characteristic equation describing the ﬁlter and
is determined by the number of reactive elements that cannot be com-
bined into single elements (e.g., through series or parallel combina-
tion). Figure 19.61(a) shows an LC ladder network with an odd
number of elements (to realize an odd-order ﬁlter), while Fig. 19.61(b)
shows one with an even number of elements (for realizing an even-
order ﬁlter). When either network is terminated by the load impedance
and the source impedance 
we obtain the structure in Fig. 19.62.
To make the design less complicated, we will assume that 
Our
goal is to synthesize the transfer function of the LC ladder network.
We begin by characterizing the ladder network by its admittance
parameters, namely,

so that the parameters 
and 
are synthesized, thereby realizing the
desired transfer function. To achieve this, we take advantage of an impor-
tant property of the LC ladder network: All z and y parameters are ratios
of polynomials that contain only even powers of s or odd powers

Two-Port Networks

Summary
1. A two-port network is one with two ports (or two pairs of access
terminals), known as input and output ports.
2. The six parameters used to model a two-port network are the
impedance 
admittance 
hybrid 
inverse hybrid 
transmission 
and inverse transmission 
parameters.
3. The parameters relate the input and output port variables as 
4. The parameters can be calculated or measured by short-circuiting
or open-circuiting the appropriate input or output port.
5. A two-port network is reciprocal if 
or 
Networks that have dependent
sources are not reciprocal.
6. Table 19.1 provides the relationships between the six sets of
parameters. Three important relationships are
7. Two-port networks may be connected in series, in parallel, or in
cascade. In the series connection the z parameters are added, in the
parallel connection the y parameters are added, and in the cascade
connection the transmission parameters are multiplied in the cor-
rect order.
8. One can use PSpice to compute the two-port parameters by con-
straining the appropriate port variables with a 1-A or 1-V source
while using an open or short circuit to impose the other necessary
constraints.
9. The network parameters are speciﬁcally applied in the analysis of
transistor circuits and the synthesis of ladder LC networks. Net-
work parameters are especially useful in the analysis of transistor
circuits because these circuits are easily modeled as two-port net-
works. LC ladder networks, important in the design of passive low-
pass ﬁlters, resemble cascaded T networks and are therefore best
analyzed as two-ports.

Simultaneous Equations 
and Matrix Inversion
In circuit analysis, we often encounter a set of simultaneous equations
having the form
(A.1)
where there are n unknown 
to be determined. Equation
(A.1) can be written in matrix form as
(A.2)
This matrix equation can be put in a compact form as
(A.3)
where
(A.4)
A is a square (
) matrix while X and B are column matrices.
There are several methods for solving Eq. (A.1) or (A.3). These
include substitution, Gaussian elimination, Cramer’s rule, matrix inver-
sion, and numerical analysis.
Cramer’s Rule
In many cases, Cramer’s rule can be used to solve the simultaneous equa-
tions we encounter in circuit analysis. Cramer’s rule states that the solution
to Eq. (A.1) or (A.3) is

Notice that 
is the determinant of matrix A and 
is the determi-
nant of the matrix formed by replacing the kth column of A by B. It
is evident from Eq. (A.5) that Cramer’s rule applies only when 
When 
, the set of equations has no unique solution, because the
equations are linearly dependent.
The value of the determinant 
, for example, can be obtained by
expanding along the ﬁrst row:
(A.7)
where the minor Mij is an 
determinant of
the matrix formed by striking out the ith row and jth column. The
value of 
may also be obtained by expanding along the first
column:

You may not ﬁnd much need to use Cramer’s method described in
this appendix, in view of the availability of calculators, computers, and
software packages such as MATLAB, which can be used easily to solve
a set of linear equations. But in case you need to solve the equations
by hand, the material covered in this appendix becomes useful. At any
rate, it is important to know the mathematical basis of those calcula-
tors and software packages.

Determine

In matrix form, the given set of equations becomes
We apply Eq. (A.11) to ﬁnd the determinants. This requires that we

Matrix Inversion
The linear system of equations in Eq. (A.3) can be solved by matrix
inversion. In the matrix equation 
, we may invert A to get X,
i.e.,
(A.13)
where 
is the inverse of A. Matrix inversion is needed in other
applications apart from using it to solve a set of equations.
By deﬁnition, the inverse of matrix A satisﬁes

where 
is the adjoint of A and 
is the determinant of
A. The adjoint of A is the transpose of the cofactors of A. Suppose we
are given an 
matrix A as
(A.16)
The cofactors of A are deﬁned as
(A.17)
where the cofactor 
is the product of 
and the determinant
of the 
submatrix is obtained by deleting the
ith row and jth column from A. For example, by deleting the ﬁrst
row and the ﬁrst column of A in Eq. (A.16), we obtain the cofactor
as
(A.18)
Once the cofactors are found, the adjoint of A is obtained as
(A.19)
where T denotes transpose.
In addition to using the cofactors to ﬁnd the adjoint of A, they are
also used in ﬁnding the determinant of A which is given by
(A.20)
where i is any value from 1 to n. By substituting Eqs. (A.19) and (A.20)
into Eq. (A.15), we obtain the inverse of A as

Complex Numbers
The ability to manipulate complex numbers is very handy in circuit
analysis and in electrical engineering in general. Complex numbers are
particularly useful in the analysis of ac circuits. Again, although cal-
culators and computer software packages are now available to manip-
ulate complex numbers, it is still advisable for a student to be familiar
with how to handle them by hand.
Representations of Complex
Numbers
A complex number z may be written in rectangular form as
(B.1)
where 
x is the real part of z while y is the imaginary part
of z; that is,
(B.2)
The complex number z is shown plotted in the complex plane in
Fig. B.1. Since 
,
(B.3)
A second way of representing the complex number z is by speci-
fying its magnitude r and the angle 
it makes with the real axis, as
Fig. B.1 shows. This is known as the polar form. It is given by

In converting from rectangular to polar form using Eq. (B.5), we must
exercise care in determining the correct value of 
These are the four
possibilities:

assuming that x and y are positive.
The third way of representing the complex z is the exponential
form:

This is almost the same as the polar form, because we use the same
magnitude r and the angle 
The three forms of representing a complex number are summa-
rized as follows.

The ﬁrst two forms are related by Eqs. (B.5) and (B.6). In Section B.3
we will derive Euler’s formula, which proves that the third form is also
equivalent to the ﬁrst two.

Two complex numbers

Solution:
(a) Since there are terms in polar and exponential forms, it may be best
to express all terms in polar form:
Thus,
(b) We can evaluate this in rectangular form, since all terms are in that
form. But

Euler’s Formula
Euler’s formula is an important result in complex variables. We derive
it from the series expansion of 
, and 
. We know that
(B.19)
Replacing x by 
gives
(B.20)
Also,
(B.21)
so that
(B.22)
Comparing Eqs. (B.20) and (B.22), we conclude that
(B.23)
This is known as Euler’s formula. The exponential form of represent-
ing a complex number as in Eq. (B.8) is based on Euler’s formula.
From Eq. (B.23), notice that
(B.24)
and that
Replacing 
by 
in Eq. (B.23) gives
(B.25)
Adding Eqs. (B.23) and (B.25) yields

COMPUTER TOOLS promote flexibility and meet 
ABET requirements
• PSpice® for Windows is a student-friendly tool introduced to students early in the text and used
throughout, with discussions and examples at the end of each appropriate chapter. Available on
the text website (www.mhhe.com/alexander) is a tutorial on PSpice for Windows and a tutorial
on MATLAB® to encourage its use in circuit analysis.
• New for the fifth edition is the addition of National Instruments Multisim™. Solutions for almost
all of the problems solved using PSpice are also available to the instructor in Multisim. For stu-
dents, there is a Multisim tutorial on our website. We have added National Instruments Multisim
because it is very user friendly with more options for analysis than PSpice. In addition, it allows
the user to easily modify circuits in order to see how changing circuit parameters impact volt-
ages, currents, and power.
• We continue to make available KCIDE for Circuits (a Knowledge Capturing Integrated Design
Environment for Circuits) to help students work through circuit problems in an organized man-
ner following the problem-solving process used in the book. The software package can be down-
loaded from http://kcide.fennresearch.org. As with PSpice and Multisim, there is a tutorial
available at our website.
CAREERS AND HISTORY of electrical engineering pioneers
Since a course in circuit analysis may be a student’s first exposure to electrical engineering, each
chapter opens with discussions about how to enhance skills that contribute to successful problem-
solving or career-oriented talks on a sub-discipline of electrical engineering. The chapter openers are
intended to help students grasp the scope of electrical engineering and give thought to the various
careers available to EE graduates. The opening boxes include information on careers in electronics,
instrumentation, electromagnetics, control systems, engineering education, and the importance of
good communication skills. Historicals throughout the text provide brief biological sketches of such
engineering pioneers as Faraday, Ampere, Edison, Henry, Fourier, Volta, and Bell.
