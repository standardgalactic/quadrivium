ing every edition of Dreamweaver For Dummies, Creating Family Web Sites For Dummies, and 
the last 5 editions of Teach Yourself Dreamweaver Visually. 
She’s also the host of a series of training videos about Web design for Total Training, includ­

Dedication
I love teaching Web design because it’s so much fun to see all the great Web sites people 
create. I dedicate this book to everyone who aspires to share their ideas, stories, views, 
photos, business products and services on the Internet. Don’t ever fear that Web design is too 
hard. You can do this, you can create your own Web site. In this book you find everything you 
need to create, design, publish, and promote your own Web site. I wish you all the best with 
your Web designs!
Author’s Acknowledgments

delightful sense of humor, and all his help in the research and production of this book. Among 
his many contributions, he authored Chapters 1, 11, and 12. Dave, your intelligence and cre­

ful wife Stephanie, and their amazing children Mikayla, Savannah, Jessica, and Calahan (you’ll 
find their photos in the sample site in the Family Web sites chapter). Thanks also to all my 
extended family, which now includes David’s large and wonderful collection of relatives, 
including Gail, Dave, Linda, Mark, Beth, Sarah, and everyone else in the LaFontaine, Roos, and

Introduction
I
f you’re feeling left out of the mad scramble to establish a presence on the 
Internet, relax — you’re not alone. And it’s not too late.
Despite the hype, many small businesses, clubs, and families still don’t have Web 
sites. And, even if you already have a site, you’re not alone if you’re still trying to 
figure out how to make it better or more profitable, or you’ve come to the realiza­
tion that it’s time to redesign.
These days, it seems that every TV commercial, movie trailer, magazine insert, and 
grocery store bulletin board warns that any serious business owner needs to have 
a Web site, and most families, clubs, and even pet snakes do, too.
Although that’s increasingly true, building a presence on the Internet isn’t some­
thing you should do just because everyone else is doing it, and it isn’t all bad if 
you’ve waited this long to make the Web a priority. Too many people have raced to 
put up Web sites without taking the time to consider how the Web fits in with their 
other goals and how they can best take advantage of what the Web has to offer.
If you’ve waited until now, you may even be better off because the Internet has 
matured, its audience has matured (it isn’t populated solely by teenagers and aca­
demics anymore), and building a Web site has become easier than ever. If you’re 
ready for a redesign of your first site, you have the advantage of being able to ben­
efit from your own and everyone else’s mistakes.
About This Book
This book is designed to help you progress through the entire process of creating a 
site, from registering a domain name, to creating a compelling design, to attracting 
just the right audience.
But you don’t have to read this book from cover to cover, and you certainly don’t 
have to memorize it. Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies was written to help you 
find the answers you need when you need them. Consider this book a quick guide 
and a reference you can return to. Each part stands alone, giving you easy answers 
to specific questions and step-by-step instructions for common tasks. If you want 
to find out how to choose a hosting service, optimize images, or add video to your 
site, just jump right in and go directly to the section that most interests you. And 
don’t worry about spilling coffee on the pages if you bring the book to breakfast — 
I promise it won’t complain!
I designed this book using what I consider the best technologies for someone who 
wants to create their own, custom Web site. If you picked up this book, I assume 
that you’re not an advanced programmer and that you don’t want to hire a team of 
expensive Web consultants. You want to do it yourself.

Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
To help you create the best site you can without your having to invest a million dol­
lars, or a million hours, I based the step-by-step tasks in each chapter on the tech­
nologies that I think offer all the features you need yet are relatively easy to figure 
out with a little guidance. For images, you find instructions for using Photoshop 
Elements, a popular and competitively priced image program that you can use to 
create, edit, and optimize images so that they download quickly. If you already 
have Adobe Photoshop, you can use that program instead; the instructions work 
for both programs. For the pages of your site, you find step-by-step instructions 
for Adobe Dreamweaver, as well as a variety of templates you can download for 
free to go along with this book so you can create a professionally designed Web 
site quickly. If you want to use other programs or services, you find alternatives 
in handy sidebars near the relevant step-by-step tasks. For example, if you want to 
use Microsoft Expression Web instead of Adobe Dreamweaver, no problem, you’ll 
find templates on the companion Web site that will work with both programs and 
instructions for using both.
About the Templates and Web Site 
for this Book
To help you get the most from this book, I created a special section at my Digital 
Family Web site with files and templates you can download and use as you follow 
along with the step-by-step tasks. You also find a FAQ (frequently asked questions), 
links, additional resources, and updates. To get all these goodies, just enter the fol­
lowing address in your Web browser:
www.digitalfamily.com/diy
You need a password to get into this protected site, but if you have this book with 
you when you log on, you have everything you need to answer a simple question on 
the Web site and gain access right away.
After you are authorized to enter the Web site, you’ll find instructions for down­
loading the images and templates, which give you a head start in creating a full-
fledged site of your own. Along with this book, you get a collection of templates 
designed to create an online profile, an artist portfolio, a business site, and a family 
or hobby site. And, you can customize the look and feel of all these templates to 
use them to create any type of site for your corner of the Web.
Throughout this book, you find references to the Web site and the templates and 
other goodies that go with the step-by-step tasks. 
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, those 
consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions is in italics? 
That’s a convention I use frequently. I put new terms in italics and then define them 
so that you know what they mean.

 Introduction
When I type URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses within regular paragraph 
text, they look like this: www.jcwarner.com. Sometimes, however, I set off a URL 
on its own line, like this:
www.jcwarner.com
That’s so you can easily spot URLs on a page if you want to type them into your 
browser to visit a site. I also assume that your Web browser doesn’t require the 
introductory http:// for Web addresses. If you use an older browser, remember 
to type this part before the address. (Also make sure to include that part of the 
address when you’re creating links.)
Even though programs like Dreamweaver make knowing the HTML code unneces­
sary, you may want to wade into the HTML waters occasionally. When I include 
HTML, such as the following code to link a URL to a Web page, I set off the HTML in 
the same monofont type as I use for URLs:
<A HREF=”http://www.jcwarner.com”>Janine’s Web Site</A>
When I introduce you to a new set of features, such as options in a dialog box, I set 
these items apart with bullets so that you can see that they’re all related. When I want 
you to follow instructions, I use numbered steps to walk you through the process.
Foolish Assumptions
Although this book is designed to help you create a professional-looking Web site, 
I don’t assume that you’re a pro — at least not yet. In keeping with the philosophy 
behind the For Dummies series, this easy-to-use guide is designed for readers with 
a wide range of experience. Being interested in Web design and wanting to create a 
Web site is the key, but that desire is all I expect from you.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the learning curve associated with any new program, I orga­
nized Web Sites Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, 2nd Edition, to be a complete reference. 
This section provides a breakdown of the four parts of the book and what you can 
find in each one.
Part I: Laying the Groundwork
Part I gets you started in creating a Web site and helps you lay a solid foundation 
for your site. In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the many ways you can create a Web 
site to help you find the best template, technology, and software you’ll need for 
your project. In Chapter 2, I walk you through the planning process, which can 
save you a lot of time in the long run. In Chapter 3, you find out how to register a 
domain name, and I give you tips for selecting the best Web server hosting service. 
And then in Chapter 4, I introduce you to just enough Web technologies, including 
HTML, CSS to give you a head start on your Web site.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together
In Chapter 5, I move on to graphics, with an introduction to creating graphics for 
the Web, an overview of the differences in formats (GIF, JPEG, and PNG files), and a 
selection of tips for optimizing images so that they download quickly. In Chapter 6, 
you find an introduction to Dreamweaver, and in Chapters 7, 8, and 9, you get step-
by-step instructions for personalizing the many templates that come with this book. 
In Chapter 10, you discover the Dreamweaver testing and publishing features so 
that you can publish your pages to the Internet as soon as you’re ready.
Part III: Going Web 2.0
In Part III, I go beyond basic Web design, by giving you instructions for creating 
a blog in Chapter 11 and for recording and publishing a podcast in Chapter 12. In 
Chapter 13, you find a review of the many audio, video, and animation formats and 
instructions for how to add multimedia to your Web site. In Chapter 14, I “show you 
the money” with instructions for including advertising and affiliates on your pages 
as well as for adding e-commerce options to sell products and services.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Chapter 15 includes ten cool Web services that can help you add advanced features 
to your site without having to know how to program. Finally, Chapter 16 features 
ten ways to promote your site, because after you do all the work of creating an out­
standing Web site, you want to make sure to attract a good audience.

C
reating a Web site can open doors for you that you never knew existed. 
Every day, thousands more people connect to the Web for the first time, 
and those who are already online get more adept at using online tools and services. 
The effect of all these people reaching out to each other to play, laugh, argue, buy, 
sell, trade, collaborate, invent, experiment, research, learn, and just chat about the 
mundane details of what constitutes a perfect cup of coffee — are transforming the 
world.
Thanks to the ever-simpler, easier, and less expensive Web technologies that you 
discover in this book, you can create a Web site today that just a few years ago 
would have required a crack team of programmers, the computing power of a room 
full of servers, and a budget of hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Today’s Internet is a friendlier place where programs like Dreamweaver and 
WordPress make it so easy that even celebrities and politicians can run their own 
sites. And if they can do it, believe me, you can, too! For just a few dollars per 
month, you can host your site on a professional Web server. At that price, almost 
any old businesses can afford to try new tricks, and new businesses can launch 
with little investment. 
Whether you’re new to Web design or want to take your Web skills to the next level 
to create a world-class Web site or blog, it’s often best to start by taking a step 
back to better understand your options before you dive in to the details of building 
and publishing a Web site. That’s what this chapter is for: to start you out with an 
overview of the different kinds of Web sites and blogs, to help you appreciate how 
templates work for different kinds of sites, and to introduce you to the tools and 
technologies you can use to create your own Web site.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
I’m not offering any “get-rich-quick” schemes in this book, but if you’re ready to 
share your talents with the world, the Web is a better place than ever. And because 
I know you probably don’t want to spend all your time creating your Web site, I’ve 
gathered everything you need in this book to make it easy for you.
Checking Out Examples 
of Success on the Web
Before I get into the technical details in this chapter, here are a few Internet success 
stories to inspire you and give you an idea of what you can do on the Internet today: 
	
✓	Three friends in Chicago started www.threadless.com as an entry into a 
contest, hoping to win $1,000. The business took off when designers flocked to 
the site to submit their artwork to be printed on t-shirts, and millions of people 
started placing orders. In a case study, the Harvard Business School cited 
Threadless as an example of a “perfect business,” one that has made its found­
ers millionaires, thanks to the Web.
	
✓	Two creative Chefs blended Korean barbecue with Mexican tacos and created 
Kogi, which they sold out of a lunch truck in Los Angles. When they started post­
ing the schedule and location of the truck on Twitter.com (the popular micro­
blogging Web site), crowds started lining up in advance for their fabulous food. 
Word spread and Kogi became a breakout hit. Today, in addition to the Web site 
shown in Figure 1-1, they have more than 42,000 rabid followers, and three state-
of-the-art trucks roaming Los Angeles and catering Hollywood parties. You can 
learn all about their great food and thriving business at www.kogibbq.com.
Figure 1-1: The Kogi lunch truck in Los Angeles developed a loyal following 
and a growing business thanks to their tasty Web site and 
smart use of www.Twitter.com.

 Chapter 1: Exploring the Best Ways to Create Web Sites
	
✓	A truly fanatical hockey aficionado who writes under the pseudonym “Eklund” 
built HockeyBuzz.com from a tiny fansite dedicated to the game he loved into 
the core of a media empire that employs more than 50 bloggers and launched 
a show on XM Radio. 
	
✓	One of the most popular personalities on YouTube, Fred is a 14-year-old kid in 
Nebraska who parlayed a cheap video camera and YouTube into a multimillion 
dollar career. If you’re old enough to drive, you’ve probably never even heard 
of him, but his videos are watched by millions of giggling kids every week at 
www.youtube.com/user/Fred. 
	
✓	Gossip writer Perez Hilton built a career through his blog where he’s known for 
his snarky comments. His celebrity-filled site at www.perezhilton.com is now 
read by more people than the tabloid magazines in the supermarket check-out 
aisles, and he charges thousands of dollars to make personal appearances at 
events. 
	
✓	A woman who just loved to shop and find bargains built Outblush.com into a 
must-read beauty, fashion, and makeup advisor for millions — and a success­
ful business for herself. Her site, featured in Figure 1-2, is now as influential as 
many glossy fashion magazines, and her product reviews can make or break a 
new line of products. 
Figure 1-2: The creator of www.outblush.com made a name for 
herself with a well-researched collection of product reviews.
What all these Web success stories have in common is that their creators were able 
to use technologies that are cheaper and easier to use than ever before to do what 
they do best in front of a bigger audience. And that’s one of the most powerful ways 
to use the Internet.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Creating Web Sites with the 
Templates in This Book
My goal in this book is to help you create not just a Web site but an online presence 
that truly serves your goals, whether you want to launch a new business on the 
Internet, promote an organization you’ve loved for years, or stay in touch with dis­
tant family members and classmates.
Here are a few of the kinds of Web sites you can create with the templates and 
instructions included with this book:
	
✓	Portfolio: Photographers, graphic designers, and artists are quickly realizing 
that one of the best ways to show off their work and win new (and better-
paying) clients is to have a snazzy online portfolio. In Figure 1-3, photographer 
Jasper Johal showcases his photos in an online gallery that makes it easy to 
view a collection of images on his home page and in a series of galleries on his 
How much does a Web site cost?
The first question many people ask Web 
designers is one of the hardest to answer: 
“How much does a Web site cost?” Just 
because the answer is, “Well, it depends . . .” 
does not mean that we’re trying to be eva­
sive. (Well, maybe some people are inten­
tionally evasive.) The truth is that the answer 
is complicated. 
Building a Web site is often compared to 
building a house because the cost depends 
on what materials you want to use and 
how much experience and fancy tools you 
have. Like a house, a Web site can range 
from a Spartan hut with bare walls and a 
dirt floor, to an opulent mansion tricked out 
with the finest marble, to a secure fortress 
with layers of security guards demanding, 
“Identification, please.” 
In the land of the Internet, these buildings 
might compare with a simple profile site, a 
multimedia showcase, or an e-commerce 
business site with shopping cart features. 
The good news is that thanks to the advances 
in Web technology, you can build any of 
these kinds of Web sites for about the cost 
of this book and a little of your own time. All 
the software featured in this book is avail­
able for free (or at least a free 30-day trial). 
If you use the templates you can down­
load from this book’s companion Web site, 
you should be able to create a Web site in 
just a few days. And if you want advanced 
features, like e-commerce or video, don’t 
worry. You find instructions in these pages 
for using some of the newest and best 
online services, including Google Checkout, 
which makes it easy (and economical) to 
add a shopping cart to your Web site, and 
Vimeo’s video hosting service, which makes 
it possible to offer high-resolution video on 
your site without an expensive Web server. 
You find links to all the online services, 
templates, and software featured in this 
book on my companion Web site at www.

site. A consulting firm could also use this type of site template to showcase 
a series of case studies, or by a carpenter or landscape architect to share 
photos of completed projects. You’ll find templates for this design on the 
companion Web site, and instructions for customizing it to create your own 
site, in Chapter 7.
	
✓	Online profile: It used to be that “who you know” was the key to getting 
ahead. Now it’s “who knows you.” A Web site is a great way to introduce 
yourself, your business, or your club to the world, and it’s also an important 
way to make it easy for other people to introduce you when they make a 
referral. 
	
	Consultants, authors, attorneys, dentists, and other professionals are well 
served by an online profile site that includes biographical information, a list 
of services or specialties, references, awards, testimonials, and links to com­
pleted projects and descriptions of your work. The template shown in Figure 
1-4 is included with this book, and you find instructions in Chapter 7 that will 
help you to create a variety of profile designs.
	
✓	Club or organization: Better than a bumper sticker, a Web site is an excellent 
way to showcase your favorite clubs, charities, after-school activities, hobbies, 
and more. The Web enables you to easily notify everyone of meeting dates 
and times, or post pictures and descriptions of recent awards and triumphs. 
A well-designed Web site can save organizers from having to make dozens of 
phone calls just to see whether everyone is good to take the soccer team out 
for ice cream after practice next week, or to coordinate fundraisers for worthy 
causes. You can use any of the templates featured in Chapters 7–9 to create a 
Web site for a club or organization.
Figure 1-3: Portfolio sites can showcase photos or artwork, like this photo 
gallery on Jasper Johal’s Web site.

Figure 1-4: You can use a template, like this design for a professional profile, to create a variety of 
designs. Change the templates a little, or a lot, to make them your own.
	
✓	Small business: Whether you want to share your professional services, like 
the massage therapist featured in Figure 1-5, or you have a growing business 
taking care of pampered pooches, like Pamela’s Pet Services in Chapter 2, 
creating a Web site can make all the difference in your success, online and off. 
You can edit any of the templates in Chapters 7–9 to create a business Web 
site, but the designs in Chapter 8 are especially well suited to business needs.
	
✓	Family and wedding: Before couples say “I do,” more and more of them are 
building wedding Web sites that feature invitations, directions, guest regis­
tries, and more. And, as a family grows, building a Web site is a helpful way 
to help the doting grandparents impress their friends without having to carry 
a wallet bulging with baby pictures. You can use the template featured in 
Chapter 9 to create any kind of site you want, but it’s especially well suited to 
creating a site for the entire family, much like the one I created for my brother 
and his family, shown in Figure 1-6.

site help create the feeling of a design that fills the page.

Comparing Web Design Options
The first step to building a site is choosing what kind of site you want to build. So, 
before you get too far into creating your own site, it can help to start with a general 
introduction to how different features are built on the Web.
To start, know that Web sites fall into two very broad categories: static Web sites, 
which are generally built with a program like Adobe Dreamweaver, and dynamic 
Web sites, which use advanced programming to create advanced, interactive fea­
tures, like those used in a WordPress blog. Keep in mind that you can add multime­
dia, video, audio, animation, and so on to either type of site.
Static Web sites are made up of a collection of individual pages with the .html or 
.htm extension. You might think that all Web sites are made up of individual pages 
(and in a way they are), but with static sites those pages are saved as separate files. 
With a dynamic site, as you discover a little later in this section, the pages you view 
in a Web browser are created dynamically as they are delivered to the browser, so 
they’re not saved as individual pages but as pieces of pages that can be mixed and 
matched. That gives dynamic sites many advantages, but it also makes them a lot 
more complicated to create.
The upshot is this: Because dynamic Web sites are more complicated to create, if 
you’re just creating a simple profile or small business site, dynamic sites are often 
not worth the extra effort. The big exception comes in with blogs, because thanks 
to specialized blogging tools like WordPress, creating a dynamic site with the 
common features of a blog is relatively easy (as you learn in Chapter 11).
As a result, many people create both a static Web site for their profile or small busi­
ness and a blog where they can easily add posts and other updates.

14
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Static Web pages
Static pages are easier to design, and they work well for small- and medium-sized Web 
sites, such as a professional profile or an online gallery. Because static Web pages 
are written in plain text, you can create them in a program as simple as Notepad or 
SimpleText although tools like Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression Web 
make it a lot easier and save you having to remember all the cryptic XHTML tags. 
A static Web site offers a few advantages, especially if you’re just starting out, 
including the following:
	
✓	Easy to learn to develop: Anyone who can resize a photo has a head start on 
the skills needed to create and arrange graphic elements on a static page. 
	
✓	Gives you complete control over design of each page: You can tweak the 
size, colors, fonts, and arrangement of the elements on each page individually, 
and you can edit templates for these kinds of sites more easily than the tem­
plates for dynamic sites. 
	
✓	Easy to build, test, and publish to a Web server: You can create and test 
static Web pages on any personal computer and then host them on any com­
mercial Web server and you only need FTP access (which is built into pro­
grams like Dreamweaver) to publish pages to the Internet. 
Dynamic Web pages
The technical aspects of dynamic sites get complicated quickly, but the gist of it is 
that instead of creating a collection of individual pages, you store all your content 
in a way that makes it easy to display text, images, and other data in a variety of 
combinations. That’s what makes it possible for shopping sites like Amazon.com to 
keep track of your last order and recommend books when you return. 
A site can even gather information from different sources to create complex pages 
dynamically. For example, you can combine information about customers’ shop­
ping habits with a list of your overstocked items on sale and create a page tailored 
to each visitor. 
Dynamic sites are generally created on a Web server by combining CSS (Cascading 
Style Sheets, introduced in Chapter 4) and XHTML (which is more or less HTML that 
complies with today’s standards, also explained in Chapter 4) with more advanced 
technologies, such as PHP, ASP.NET, or ColdFusion. That brings up another of the big 
challenges of working on dynamic sites: You have to build and test dynamic pages 
on a computer that runs a Web server, which is a lot more complicated than simply 
installing a Web browser on your personal PC to test your pages, as you learn in 
Chapter 10. Launching a dynamic site on a commercial Web server is also far more 
complicated than publishing a static page site to a Web server.
That said, the advantages of dynamic Web sites are significant, and most big sites on 
the Web are created this way, but most of the big sites on the Web also have a team 
of experienced programmers behind them. Unless you have advanced programming 
skills or a big budget, the challenges of creating a dynamic Web site mean that most 
small- and medium-sized Web sites are still better served with static Web sites. 

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring the Best Ways to Create Web Sites
The big exception is blogging. Although blogging tools, such as WordPress and 
Blogger, create dynamic Web sites with all these advanced capabilities, they do it 
in a way that makes it relatively easy to launch and update. As you discover in the 
section on WordPress templates that follows, it’s easy to create a blog but not so 
easy to edit the templates for a blog — another reason to consider creating a static 
site with a program like Dreamweaver. And remember: You can always create one 
of each, to get the best of both worlds.
The gardening Web site www.GardenstoTables.com (featured in Figure 1-7), was 
created with a program called Joomla!. Similar to WordPress, Joomla! offers many 
types of templates and add-ons to make it easier to create a dynamic Web site. 
These tools are ideal if you plan to create a large, complex site, especially one that 
you expect to grow to have hundreds or thousands of pages over time.
The advantages of a dynamic site include
	
✓	Easily updated: When you want to put new content into a dynamic Web site, 
you can simply add a new product or image to the database, and it automati­
cally appears in all the corresponding pages in the site. 
	
✓	Consistent look: When you create a dynamic site, you have to use templates, 
which help create a consistent look across a Web site. No matter how you 
build a site, being consistent is good practice when it comes to navigation but­
tons, banners, and other essential elements you want your visitors to find no 
matter which page they visit.
	
✓	Easier to redesign: All great Web sites grow and change over time, and as they 
get bigger, they become even more complex to redesign. With a dynamic site, 
you can simply update the templates, and the content will automatically be 
included in the new version of the site. 
Figure 1-7: Online blogging and content management programs, such as 
WordPress and Joomla!, make it easier than ever to create 
magazine-style sites like Gardens to Tables.

16
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Multimedia: You like to move it-move it . . .
I use the catch-all title “multimedia” to describe anything that moves on a Web 
page, but that’s a lot of different things these days, and most people have trouble 
identifying the different ways you can make characters sing and dance on the Web. 
Multimedia should be considered distinct from static and dynamic sites because 
video, audio, and images can be added to both static and dynamic Web pages.
Today there are many ways to add multimedia to a Web page, and the same series 
of animated images could be created using video as an animation in Adobe Flash or 
as a simple animated GIF. One of the newest ways to add interactivity to a site is to 
use a technology called AJAX, which combines JavaScript and XML and is growing 
in popularity.
Fortunately, you don’t have to worry too much about all the technical details to 
add multimedia to your Web pages. As you learn in Chapter 13, you can easily add 
many different kinds of audio and video formats using Adobe Dreamweaver, and 
you can even upload videos to a site like YouTube or Vimeo, and then insert them 
into any Web page with copy-and-paste ease.
Working with Different Kinds of Templates
The term template is used in many different ways for many different kinds of design 
work (on and off the Web), but essentially, a template is a shortcut in the design 
process. Think of a template as a set of design specifications that you can use to 
control the look and feel of your Web page. Templates can be used to set the back­
ground colors, how many columns (if any) your Web pages have, what font sizes 
and colors are used, how links are handled, and so on. Just about any aspect of the 
design or functionality can be set or adjusted by working with templates. 
But not all templates are created equally. Although they all share those basic 
characteristics, many different kinds of templates are in use on the Web today. For 
example, most of the templates featured in this book were designed to create static 
Web sites with Dreamweaver, but they are quite different from the kinds of tem­
plates you would use if you were creating a blog with WordPress. You learn how to 
create a WordPress blog in Chapter 11, but before you start using any of these tem­
plates, I think it’s helpful to better understand how they are different. 
The templates featured in this book are
	
✓	Dreamweaver templates (extension .dwt) 
	
	Dreamweaver templates offer many advantages without requiring advanced pro­
gramming skills. When you create Dreamweaver templates with the .dwt exten­
sion, you can use XHTML and CSS to create relatively simple static Web sites that 
include high-end features found on dynamic sites, such as the ability to create new 
pages quickly and to update every page in your site with the click of a button.
	
	Although you can use Dreamweaver to create templates that use advanced 
programming like PHP or Java, the .dwt Dreamweaver template is a much 
simpler option that is ideal for small- to medium-sized Web sites, which is why 
I used this template style for the profile, portfolio, small business, and family 
sites featured in Chapters 7–9.

17
 Chapter 1: Exploring the Best Ways to Create Web Sites
	
	You can even create your own Dreamweaver templates by following the 
instructions in Chapter 6, and you can download Dreamweaver templates 
from many different Web sites (some for free, others for a fee). If you have this 
book, you have everything you need to download the collection of templates 
specially designed for the tutorials in Chapters 7, 8, and 9. Just visit www.
DigitalFamily.com/diy and follow the simple instructions to download 
the Dreamweaver Templates and image files included with them.
	
✓	WordPress templates (extension: .php)
	
	Templates such as the ones you get with a blogging program like WordPress 
use the extension .php because they are written in the PHP (Hypertext 
Preprocessor) programming language. WordPress templates offer many of 
the same benefits as Dreamweaver templates, except that templates for blogs 
like WordPress draw their content from a database. As a result, they include 
XHTML and CSS like the Dreamweaver templates, plus much more complicated 
programming in the PHP programming language.
	
	When you design a blog or any other kind of dynamic site (explained in greater 
detail in the previous section), it’s important to understand that the technol­
ogy behind the scenes gets complicated very quickly. This may seem counter­
intuitive because creating a blog on a site like WordPress.com is so easy, and 
updating a blog with new posts after it’s been built is super easy.
	
	But here’s the rub: It is easy to create a basic blog with a WordPress template, 
but it’s not easy to edit a WordPress template. Thus, if you want to be able to 
change the design of your blog pages, alter the fonts, colors, and other design 
features, things get complicated really quickly.
What kind of templates should you use?
Which templates are best for you depends on your goals and your technical skills, 
but it comes down to this. If you’re creating a relatively small Web site (less than 
50 pages), you’ll probably have an easier time with Dreamweaver templates and the 
instructions in Chapters 7–9 for creating profile, portfolio, and small business sites. 
Matching templates and technology
In addition to the WordPress and 
Dreamweaver templates featured in this 
book, there are many other kinds of tem­
plates in use on the Web. For example, if 
you download a template designed for 
Adobe Flash, you’ll need a program that 
supports Flash to edit the pages. Flash tem­
plates end in the .swf extension, and you 
wouldn’t be able to use a Flash template 
with WordPress blog, for example. 
Other kinds of templates in use on the Web 
today include templates for Microsoft ASP 
and ASP.NET sites, which use the .asp and 
.aspx extensions, respectively.
If a site is created using the Java or Pearl 
programming languages, the templates 
should end in .jsp or .prl, respectively.
The big lesson is this: Make sure you have 
the right kind of template for the kind of site 
or blog you are creating. 

18
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
If, however, you want to create an online journal or magazine that you will update 
often and expect to grow to hundreds or even thousands of pages, then creating a 
blog with WordPress is well worth the extra effort.
And here’s where it gets really fun. Many people create both a Web site, say for 
their business portfolio, and a blog where they can add posts and other updates 
over time. Linking a blog and a Web site together is easy, and with this book, you 
have everything you need to create both.
Reviewing Web Design 
and Graphics Programs
I’ve chosen the most popular and powerful tools for you in this book. After years 
of testing Web design programs and building many different kinds of sites, I have 
found these to be the best options for the kinds of sites featured in this book. But 
that doesn’t mean you can’t substitute another program you prefer (or already 
have lying around your hard drive). For example, if you already have the full pro­
fessional version of Adobe Photoshop, you can definitely use it with the lessons in 
the book. But because that program alone costs around $600, I choose to feature 
Photoshop’s little sister, Photoshop Elements, which has all the basic features you 
need, but with a simpler user interface (and a price tag of less than $100). 
When it comes to creating Web sites with XHTML and CSS, my first choice is Adobe 
Dreamweaver. If you’re a Microsoft fan, I have to say I’ve also had good success 
with Microsoft Expression Web, and you can use that program to create all the 
sites featured in this book as well. 
Both Dreamweaver and Expression Web sport graphic user interfaces that allow 
you to accomplish tasks through clicking and dragging instead of writing compli­
cated CSS and XHTML tags. To help you appreciate the differences between these 
programs, you’ll find a few more details in the last section of this chapter. 
Although I believe that Photoshop Elements and Dreamweaver are the best pro­
grams for do-it-yourselfers just getting started on the Web, I include this general 
description of a few popular Web design and graphics programs on the market 
today to help you better appreciate your options. (You find descriptions of the 
most popular blogging programs, such as WordPress and TypePad, in Chapter 11.)
Comparing Web design programs
In the early days of the Web, people were using lots of different visual HTML 
editors. Today only a few major ones are in common use on the Web: Adobe 
Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression Web. Both programs are available for 
download as trial versions. 
	
✓	Adobe Dreamweaver: By far the most popular choice among professional Web 
designers, this award-winning program offers high-end development tools, 
excellent design features, and valuable support for all the latest Internet tech­
nologies. Dreamweaver features a wide collection of customizable palettes,

floating dialog boxes, and toolbars, which makes it look more like an image 
editor than a word processor. If you’re serious about Web design, this is the 
tool to use, which is why I chose Dreamweaver to feature in this book. 
	
	If you don’t have a copy of Dreamweaver, you can download a fully functional 
30-day trial version for free by visiting www.adobe.com/dreamweaver.
	
	You find an introduction to Dreamweaver in Chapter 6 and step-by-step 
instructions for customizing the various templates featured in this book 
in Chapters 7, 8, and 9. When you’re ready for more advanced design with 
Dreamweaver, you find a collection of online tutorials at www.Digital
Family.com/dreamweaver (shown in Figure 1-8), including excerpts of 
my book Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies (Wiley).
	
✓	Adobe Contribute: Contribute is designed to make it easy for anyone to “con­
tribute” to a Web site. This reasonably priced program is easy and intuitive 
to use, but it’s not a stand-alone program. Contribute isn’t designed to create 
Web sites but to help you easily update an existing site. You need a program 
like Dreamweaver to create a Web site using the templates in this book, but if 
you want to enable others who know little or nothing about the Web to update 
the site, Contribute is a great option. You can download a free trial version at 
www.adobe.com/contribute.
	
✓	Microsoft Expression Web: Just because I loved Dreamweaver first doesn’t 
mean I don’t respect Expression Web. Microsoft has a lot to be proud of with 
this relatively new professional design program. Expression Web offers strong 
CSS support and follows standards better than FrontPage ever did. You can 
create XHTML and CSS with Expression Web, and you’ll find special features for 
creating dynamic sites with ASP.NET. If you generally prefer Microsoft products 
and/or work with a developer who uses Visual Studio, you should appreciate 
the compatibility between Microsoft Visual Studio and Expression Web. You can 
download a free trial version at www.microsoft.com/expression.

on my Digital Family Web site.

Comparing image editing programs
You can find many choices in the world of image editing programs, from high-end pro­
grams, such as Adobe Photoshop, to “prosumer” (professional consumer) products, 
like Photoshop Elements, to simple programs that you can download for free over the 
Internet, such as Irfanview. Here’s a quick comparison of image editing programs:
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop: By far the most popular image editing program in the history 
of computer design, Photoshop lets you create, edit, and manipulate images in 
myriad ways. It’s a professional tool with a professional price tag (around $600), 
so unless you have a big budget or you’re a serious photographer or designer, 
Photoshop is probably more than you need (or want to pay for). You can down­
load a 30-day free trial version at www.adobe.com/photoshop.
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop Elements: Photoshop Elements features many of the same 
powerful tools as Photoshop, but it’s easier to use and costs less than $100. 
Elements provides more than enough power for almost anything you need to do 
on a Web site, including optimizing images in the JPEG, GIF, or PNG format so that 
they download faster over the Internet. You find an introduction to Elements and 
instructions for creating and optimizing graphics for the Web in Chapter 5.
	
	The difference between Photoshop and Photoshop Elements boils down to 
this: The expensive version is used by magazine editors and high-fashion 
photographers, for example, to perform painstaking, exacting work on their 
photos, to make flawless images that can be turned into four-color separations 
to run on million-dollar printing presses. (Given enough time, you can use 
Photoshop to make a mule look like a supermodel.) For the rest of us, who just 
want to edit photos or perhaps create the impression that Uncle Ernie’s basset 
hound is driving the lawnmower, Photoshop Elements is all you need. You can 
download a 30-day free trial version at www.adobe.com/elements.
	
✓	Adobe Fireworks: Fireworks was designed specifically for creating and optimiz­
ing images on the Web. Fireworks is a favorite among many professional Web 
designers because you can create a complete page layout in Fireworks, and then 
use the program’s slicing tool to optimize and export images for the Web while 
Fireworks automatically creates the necessary XHTML code for you. It’s not a 
perfect science, but it’s pretty impressive. And because Fireworks is integrated 
with Dreamweaver, you can move back and forth between the two programs, 
which makes it easier to make changes to designs that use lots of images. You 
can download a 30-day free trial version at www.adobe.com/fireworks.
	
✓	Free image editing programs: Search the Web for free photo editor, and you 
find many listed but only a few that are even worth downloading. If you’re will­
ing to settle for a more limited program to save money, consider the online 
editor at www.irfanview.com or download the popular GIMP (GNU Image 
Manipulation Program). You can find this open-source editor (available for 
Windows, Unix, and Linux) at www.gimp.org.

I
f a potential partner approached you with a “great new business idea” guaran­
teed to make you money, you’d probably ask a lot of questions before you even 
considered writing a check to get things started. You’d probably also develop a 
business plan, or at least explore in detail how the new business would work, how 
much it would cost you, and how much money you could expect to make in return.
If you’re considering creating a Web site, or redesigning the one you already have, 
I recommend taking the same cautious approach. After all, a good Web site is an 
extension of your business — and, in many cases, a new product, service, or store­
front that deserves the same level of planning as any other serious business ven­
ture. Even if you’re creating a site for a hobby, vacation photos, or pictures of your 
family, the principles covered in this chapter will help ensure that developing your 
site goes smoothly and the final result gains you all the approval and praise you 
deserve.
This chapter is designed to help you carefully consider the many aspects of plan­
ning a Web site before you start building. You’ll also find a series of questions to 
help guide you through the early stages of the development process.
	
If you can complete the exercises in this chapter with a business partner or someone 
you trust to provide a reality check, I recommend it. You know what they say about 
decisions made in a vacuum: They generally suck. If you’re reading this book, you’re 
probably already convinced that you should create a Web site, and you may even 
have a pretty good idea about how you want to design it. Before you dive in, talk 
through the process with someone else who can provide a fresh perspective and 
help you consider aspects you may have overlooked. It’s also a lot more fun to go 
through the exercises in this chapter and answer the questionnaires with a partner. 
Don’t worry, though, if you’re on your own (or you’re determined to keep your proj­
ect a secret until it’s done). Consider me your virtual partner and let my questions 
and planning tips in this chapter serve as a guide to get you started.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Developing a Project Plan
As with most project plans, a good Web site plan is made up of a series of tasks, a 
budget, a timeline, and a list of the resources and materials you need. Taking the 
time to create a detailed project plan gives you a structure within which you can 
work with greater confidence, and a much better chance of meeting your original 
goals on time and on budget.
The following list provides a step-by-step approach to creating a project plan:
	
1.	 Define the goals and objectives of your site.
	
2.	 Create a content list.
	
3.	 Create a task list.
	
4.	 Set a timeline.
	
5.	 Establish a budget.
	
6.	 Assemble a team.
	
7.	 Create a site design and navigation structure.
In the sections that follow, you find out the details involved in each of these steps 
(with the exception of Step 7). Creating your design and navigation is such a big step 
that it gets a section all its own later in this chapter, “Designing Your Web Site.”
In the sections that follow, you find out the details involved in each of these steps.
Defining goals and objectives
The series of questions in this section are designed to help you assess how a Web 
site can best serve you, your business, or organization. Taking the time to answer 
each question should help you define the goals of your site and create a guide that 
you can use as you organize and prioritize the development.
Before you start sketching out the home page (also called the front page), define the 
most important aspects of a Web site to identify what you really need. Remember 
that you can always start small and develop a Web site over time. And there’s no 
rush to get the site up as fast as possible — the Web isn’t going anywhere, and the 
best uses of the Web are the ones that will be around for a long time.
Before you even start, make sure that you and your staff (or friends and family) are 
clear about why you’re creating a Web site and what it will take. Spend a little time 
answering each of the following questions, and use your responses to shape the 
planning and implementation of your Web site. Creating an outstanding Web site 
takes effort, and that effort can take time away from other things that are impor­
tant. The more you plan, the more you have time left over for a little fun and relax­
ation (at least once in a while).

23
 Chapter 2: Planning Makes Web Design Easier
	
✓	Why is having a Web site important to you?
	
	Separate the pipe from the dream and get clear on your true motivation.
	
✓	What are your objectives?
	
	Determine whether you will use your Web site to promote your business, sell 
products or services, cut costs, showcase clients, provide customer support, stay 
in touch with friends and family, or do something that no one else has ever done.
	
	As you go through the planning and development process, write down your 
top goals and refine them until you have two (at most, three) clear objectives 
for your site. Then keep your list somewhere that you’re forced to look at your 
objectives regularly, like the edge of your computer monitor or the bathroom 
mirror. Whenever you have a question about any aspect of the design, content, 
or development of your site, refer to your list of goals and make sure that your 
decisions remain true to your objectives.
	
✓	How will you measure success?
	
	You won’t achieve success with your Web site project unless you can effectively 
measure its results, so be sure that you can voice your objectives in measurable 
ways. The more specific and quantifiable you can be, the better. For example, 
rather than just state, “The goal is reducing the telemarketing staff,” assign an 
amount and a timeframe to make an objective quantifiable, such as, “The goal 
is reducing the telemarketing staff by 20 percent in six months.” Doing so helps 
you make sure that you’re taking the necessary steps to achieve that goal.
	
✓	Whom do you want to visit your Web site?
	
	Consider your audience above all else. If you’re creating a sales site for real 
estate investors, you should probably take a different design approach than 
if you’re creating a game site for 12-year-olds. If you’re not sure what 12-year-
olds want on a Web site, round some up and ask them.
	
	Clarifying the target audience of your Web site should be a key factor in how 
you plan and develop your site, from the vocabulary you use to how public 
you make the information. For example, a site for doctors might include com­
plex medical terms, whereas a site for patients needs more common language. 
Similarly, an architect might create a Web site with a public section where 
potential clients can view photos of completed projects and testimonials, and 
also create a password-protected section where current clients can view plans 
as they’re being developed.
	
✓	What do you want a user to gain from visiting your Web site?
	
	One of my favorite benefits of a Web site is instant information at 1 a.m. with­
out having to talk to anybody or wait on hold. Take time to consider what you 
want your visitors to learn from your site, and then make sure that the infor­
mation is front and center in your design and development plans.
	
✓	What do you want users to do after or on visits to your Web site?
	
	The more specific you can be about what you want visitors to do on your site, 
the better. Do you want visitors to buy a product, hire you to perform a ser­
vice, join an association, call and ask for an appointment, sign up for a newslet­
ter, or just tell their friends and family how cool your Web site is? Whatever 
you desire, you want your site’s design to encourage visitors to take that 
action and to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.

24
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
	
✓	How does your idea for a Web site compare with others?
	
	Taking the time to research what other people have done with their Web sites 
before you get too far into developing yours is an important part of the plan­
ning process. An afternoon spent surfing the Web for related businesses, and 
even unrelated businesses that have similar features, can help you identify 
things you may want to include on your own site and help ensure you’re not 
starting a Web site in a category that’s already so competitive you’ll need to 
really distinguish yourself to attract an audience.
	
✓	Do you expect to make money on your Web site?
	
	If your answer is, “Of course I do!” that goal should shape everything you do 
as you design the way visitors will use your site. Pay special attention to the 
section “Establishing a budget,” later in this chapter, to help ensure you see a 
return on your investment.
	
	Besides being potential cash generators, Web sites can help you be more com­
petitive, advertise your store or services, schedule and inform staff, and reduce 
travel and other types of expenses. Web sites are a great way to introduce your­
self to the world and help other people introduce you when they make a referral. 
Some of the most successful Web sites are designed to save money by reducing 
long distance phone charges and other customer support expenses.
Creating a content list
All the text, graphics, and multimedia that you want to display on the pages of your 
Web site are commonly referred to as the content of your site. To help guide your 
work and planning, your content list should include all the photos, graphics, biogra­
phies, product descriptions, maps, video files, and any other items that you might 
want to feature on your site.
The best way to start creating a content list is to brainstorm all the things you 
think you might want to include, such as contact information, product descriptions, 
logos, pictures of the staff, and biographies.
Pamela’s Pet Services defined goals
To help you appreciate how the planning 
process for a Web site could work, I’ll 
use the fictitious business, Pamela’s Pet 
Services, as an example. After you com­
plete the initial questionnaire earlier in this 
chapter, you should create a list of goals 
that looks something like this:
	✓	 Promote Pamela’s dog walking, groom­
ing, and other services.
	✓	 Describe and showcase Pamela’s pet 
services.
	✓	 Help customers easily find Pamela’s 
contact information, hours, and 
location.
	✓	 Encourage site visitors to register their 
pet’s names, ages, and special needs.
	✓	 Sign up visitors for Pamela’s Pet Tips 
e-mail newsletter.

25
 Chapter 2: Planning Makes Web Design Easier
Even if you think you already know what you want on your site, you may be sur­
prised when you start brainstorming by the ideas you come up with, such as gath­
ering testimonials from happy customers. Creating a detailed content list is well 
worth the time because it will serve as a valuable tool that you can refer to as you 
develop your project plan, site map, and task list. As you continue to develop the 
project plan and ultimately the site, you’ll probably discover more things that you 
want to add to the content list, so make sure to create it in a way that’s easy to add 
to and edit as you progress.
	
A program like Microsoft Word (or, if you prefer, Excel) is an excellent tool for 
this task because you can easily make additions and move content around as you 
develop your list.
Use the content list as you create the site map (covered later in this chapter, in the 
section “Creating a site map”), and you’re likely to think of additions to the content 
list as you work on that step. For example, as Pamela creates the About Us page for 
her Pet Services site, she might realize that she wants to add a picture of her own 
dogs and a map to her grooming salon.
Creating a task list
The task list — the heart of your project plan — is a list of tasks that must be 
accomplished to meet your goals and launch your Web site. Your task list should 
include everything from registering your domain name to promoting your site after 
it’s launched.
You can create a task list in many ways, including a few software programs 
designed to help with project management. If you’re creating a relatively simple 
Web site and you’re working alone or on a very small team, you might not need 
much more than a list with a few notes and dates attached to each task. If you’re 
Pamela’s Pet Services content list
Continuing with Pamela’s Pet Services as an 
example, a content list might look like this:
	✓	 Company logo
	✓	 Contact information
	✓	 Biography and photo of Pamela
	✓	 Photos of Pamela dogs and some of her 
client’s pets
	✓	 Descriptive paragraph about each of her 
pet services: grooming, walking, and 
so on
	✓	 Pricing and scheduling information
	✓	 Credit and payment information and 
policies
	✓	 Photos that provide a tour of the groom­
ing salon
	✓	 A map to the grooming salon
	✓	 A welcome message for the home page
	✓	 Description of the newsletter and invita­
tion to sign up
	✓	 Company description for the About Us 
page
	✓	 Testimonials from current clients

26
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
working on a more complex project with a team, you might want to further define 
the task list by using a program like Microsoft Project, which includes a variety of 
features designed to make it easy to plan and track tasks.
When you create your task list, keep in mind that gathering your content is one of 
the most time-consuming aspects of any Web site project. Most people underesti­
mate how much time they’ll spend taking pictures (or finding the ones they already 
have); gathering digital versions of logos and other graphics; and writing all the text 
descriptions, biographies and other elements for their Web site. Creating a compre­
hensive content list at the beginning can serve as a great first step and an excellent 
guide to help you gauge how long it will take you to gather, create, and review all 
the contents of your site. Here are a few suggestions for breaking down the com­
plex task of gathering the materials you’ll need in your site:
	
✓	Gather existing content. You might already have much of the content you 
need in brochures, press releases, or other materials related to your company 
or organization. Start with the easy stuff; it will give you a sense of accomplish­
ment right away and help you determine how much more you’ll need to do.
	
✓	Digitize your text. If you’re including existing content in your site, you might 
still have to do some work to get it all in digital format, where text is converted 
into a word processing or other text file. For example, you may have to retype 
text files to be able to use them on your Web site. If you have a lot of text, con­
sider scanning the documents and using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
software to transform the scanned text into editable text.
	
✓	Digitize images. If you already have photos, a logo, or other graphics you want 
to use, those images might have to be scanned. Even if you already have digital 
photos, before you can add them to a Web page, they must be in the correct 
format and optimized, a process that helps them to be downloaded as quickly 
as possible over the Internet. (You can find step-by-step instructions for pre­
paring and optimizing images for the Web in Chapter 5.)
	
✓	Create new content for your site. You might want to create a photo tour of 
your shop (to feature on the home page) or write or update biographies of key 
personnel.
	
If you hired a graphic designer to create your logo or brochure, you may want to 
go back to that person to ask for digital copies of the text and graphics, but don’t 
expect to get it overnight. Plan ahead and request any materials you may need from 
other people early in the process so you’ll be less likely to have to delay launching 
your site because you’re still waiting for them.
Setting a timeline
With your task list ironed out, you’re ready to create a timeline. Several popular 
task-management programs can help. Microsoft Project can help you define a task, 
specify how long it should take, and then associate it with other tasks on a timeline. 
If you don’t want to spend the money on Microsoft Project or take the time to learn 
this somewhat complex program, you can create a simple project plan in any calen­
dar program or even in a spreadsheet or word processing program. It’s even okay 
to use the old-fashioned approach of writing your tasks on a printed calendar page. 
(I rather like having them up on the wall in my office for easy reference.)

27
 Chapter 2: Planning Makes Web Design Easier
	
Your main goal is to create a timeline that can be adjusted if someone misses a dead­
line or if a project takes more (or less) time than expected.
Be sure to give yourself a realistic timeframe to do a good job, and factor in a little 
more time than you think you need, especially if you’re new to Web design. Setting 
and enforcing deadlines can help you stick to your timeline: Even if you’re working on 
a Web site by yourself, or with a very small team, setting deadlines can be one of the 
most important parts of your project plan — and your best chance of finishing. Most 
good Web sites are never-ending projects because you can always add more content 
and develop them further although you shouldn’t let that keep you from getting your 
site launched. Set a deadline for at least the first phase of development, and then 
hold yourself to it.
	
Tying a deadline to a special event or occasion, even if you’re creating a personal 
site, can help make you stick to the date. For example, set a launch date for a family 
Web site on an occasion like your grandma’s birthday so that you can make it a sur­
prise for her. Or, plan to publish the redesign for your small business site in time for 
a trade show or annual sales event. When a deadline has a specific date and a clear 
goal associated with it, it’s easier to take the deadlines seriously.
Establishing a budget
“How much does a Web site cost?” is often the first question asked by someone 
who decides that they want a Web site. But, if you think about it, it’s a little like 
asking how much it costs to build a house: “It depends.” The answer depends on 
how many rooms you want, whether you want a marble or cement staircase, and 
Pamela’s Pet Services task list
The following includes many common tasks 
you’ll likely want to include in your own list.
	✓	 Register a domain name for the Web site.
	✓	 Evaluate and select a Web site–hosting 
company.
	✓	 Create a list of all the main sections and 
subsections of the site.
	✓	 Create and gather photos and graphics.
	✓	 Request photos or graphics other people 
(graphic designer, clients, and friends).
	✓	 Write the first e-mail newsletter to send 
to those who sign up.
	✓	 Request testimonials from current clients.
	✓	 Create a site map that details how the 
main sections and subsections will be 
linked.
	✓	 Download the templates from Janine’s 
Web site that goes with this book (www.
DigitalFamily.com/diy).
	✓	 Optimize images, graphics, and multi­
media files to prepare them for the site.
	✓	 Use templates to create the home page, 
each main section front, and any special 
internal pages.
	✓	 Build out the pages of the site, adding 
content into the page templates.
	✓	 Test, test, and test some more.
	✓	 Publish your site on the Web.
	✓	 Tell everyone you know that your site is 
online and start working on the details 
of your marketing plan.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
whether you want a swimming pool in the backyard. You may have no idea how 
much it costs to build a home. After all, different contractors provide different price 
quotes based on how experienced they are or the kinds of materials they plan to 
use. If you’re planning to build the house yourself, it becomes your job to figure out 
whether the features you want are reasonable and affordable.
Fortunately, most Web sites (at least the kind you’re likely to build yourself with the 
templates and instructions provided in this book) don’t cost nearly as much as a house 
(or even a dog house). Before you can set a realistic budget, though, you need to break 
down the project into pieces (by following the steps outlined earlier in this chapter) 
and then start adding prices to the task list in your project plan. Determining the cost 
of each element of a Web project helps you manage the cost and scope and estimate 
the overall costs. Among the key costs you can expect are the ones in this list:
	
✓	Web hosting: This service can cost as little as a few dollars per month or as 
much as a couple of hundred dollars (if you plan to include high-definition video 
files, which require more space on a server and more bandwidth to download). 
E-commerce features can also add to the cost of monthly hosting. (You find sug­
gestions for choosing the best hosting service for your site in Chapter 3.)
	
✓	Domain names: A domain name costs between $8 to $20 per year, depending on 
the registration service you use and any special features you request, such as 
private registration, which is a lot like having an unlisted phone number. You can 
even register more than one domain name for the same site, but only if the name 
hasn’t already been registered by someone else. (You find tips about, check the 
availability of domains, and register your own domain names in Chapter 3.)
	
✓	Software programs: The tools used to create a Web site can range from free 
to expensive. At the very least, consider getting an image editing program 
like Adobe Photoshop ($650) or Photoshop Elements ($99; a fine alternative if 
you’re not a professional graphic designer). For Web design, I find that Adobe 
Dreamweaver ($399) is well worth the price. However, Microsoft Expression 
Web is also a great Web design program, and Microsoft lowered the price of its 
most recent version to just $149. You can use any of these programs with the 
templates and lessons in this book. You find a more detailed comparison of 
the options to help you find what’s best for your site in Chapter 1.
	
✓	Your time: If you’re building a site yourself, one of your biggest costs is likely 
to be the time you spend working on it. Don’t underestimate the value of your 
own time if you run your own business. It may be well worth hiring a student 
or an assistant to help with time-consuming tasks, such as adding text and 
images to all the pages of your site, or scanning lots of photos and graphics.
	
✓	Consulting services: Another major cost for do-it-yourselfers is any consult­
ing service you use to augment your own skills. For example, you might hire a 
graphic designer to create a logo; an editor to review text; or a programmer to 
create complex, interactive features, like a password-protected section where 
you keep clients informed as you work on their private projects.
	
✓	Shopping cart and e-commerce transaction features: If you want a shopping 
system, compare the costs of a few and then include a rough estimate until 
you make a final decision. (You find recommended services in Chapter 15.)
	
✓	Traffic reporting services: Most Web hosting companies provide basic traf­
fic statistics about visitors to your Web site, but you will almost always get 
more detailed reports if you use a dedicated traffic service, such as Google 
Analytics, covered in Chapter 10.

29
 Chapter 2: Planning Makes Web Design Easier
	
As you put together your budget, start with the clear-cut costs, like paying for a domain 
name and hosting, and then move on to other items specific to your needs and include 
your best estimate. After you have a price quote for each element and begin putting the 
pieces together, you can distinguish the more expensive features and better decide 
which ones you can afford now and which ones you may want to add later.
Assembling a team
Don’t go it alone! The best Web sites are developed by a team of people with a vari­
ety of skills, including writers, designers, programmers, and multimedia producers. 
If you’re developing a relatively small, simple Web site, you might not need a lot of 
people with specialized skills on your team, but the more you can divide the work 
among experts, the better. Although the instructions and templates included with this 
book are designed to help you do it yourself, you occasionally still have to seek out 
specialists — like a good editor to ensure that your text is well written, or a program­
mer who can create advanced features, like password-protected sections of a Web site.
Throughout this book, I’ve worked hard to give you the best and easiest ways to 
create a Web site on your own, but I would be remiss not to point out that hiring a 
specialist or two once in a while can be a helpful way to complement the work you 
do yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
Designing Your Web Site
No matter how technically sophisticated a Web site is or how creative its writing, 
most people notice a site’s design first. If you want to make the most impact with 
your Web site, make sure that you leave plenty of time or reserve funds in the 
budget to develop (or buy) professional-looking graphics.
The best design is one that suits your audience — and that may or may not mean 
lots of fancy graphics and animations. To pinpoint the right design for your site, 
follow these guidelines:
	
✓	Before you develop the design, think about whom you want to attract to your 
Web site. A gaming Web site geared toward teenagers should look much differ­
ent from a Web site with gardening tips or an online banking site for adults.
	
✓	Review other sites designed for your target market. A good way to determine 
what might work best for your audience is to study similar sites, taking note of 
how they use images, set up navigational links, and organize information. You 
don’t want your site to look exactly like your competition because you want 
your site to stand out (and you shouldn’t just copy someone else’s design), 
but you can certainly gain useful ideas from reviewing other people’s sites.
	
✓	Consider the limitations of mobile devices. Increasingly, people are visit­
ing Web sites from cellphones, looking for things like a new restaurant for 
lunch while they’re running errands or the address of a business they want to 
visit while they’re driving there. Mobile devices are a great way to find what 
you need, when you need it, but only if the Web site you’re trying to visit is 
designed to work on a mobile phone. As you create the design for your site, 
keep in mind the limitations of small screen sizes and how much harder it can

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
be to click links without a mouse. Today, you have two options if you care 
about visitors using mobile phones. Keep things relatively simple so they work 
on most devices or create a second, simplified version of your sites specifi­
cally for the mobile phone. To learn more about designing Web sites for cell­
phones and other mobile devices, read my upcoming book Mobile Web Design 
For Dummies (Wiley).
	
✓	Keep in mind how your design decisions might affect download times. 
Consider your audience’s time constraints, attention span, and (most impor­
tantly) goals. If you design your site to provide information to busy business­
people, you want fast-loading pages with limited graphics, video, or other 
multimedia. If you design your site for entertainment, your audience is likely to 
wait a little longer for videos and other interactive features.
Creating a consistent design
Most Web sites work best, and are easiest to navigate, when they follow a consis­
tent design. Here’s a case in point: Most readers take for granted that books don’t 
change their design from page to page and that newspapers don’t change headline 
fonts and logos from day to day. Consistency is one of the primary tools used in 
books and newspapers to help readers easily distinguish different elements and 
follow a story or theme.
As you lay out your Web page, keep related items close to one another and be con­
sistent about how you design similar content elements. Viewers should instantly 
understand which pieces of information are related to each other.
Here are a few good ways to distinguish different kinds of information:
	
✓	Design: To ensure a consistent style, define a set of colors, shapes, or other ele­
ments that you use throughout the site and then stick to them. Choose two or 
three fonts for your Web site and use them consistently. For example, a common 
practice is to use the Arial font for headlines and Times for the text in paragraphs. 
Then you might use a special font for a logo or for advertising so that it stands out 
on the page. Using too many fonts makes anything harder to read and confusing.
	
	You can easily get dazzled by all the special effects you can add to a Web page. 
Don’t fall into the trap of using fancy features just because you can. (“Look, Ma — 
I made the text on my Web page blink in neon pink!”) Keep in mind that the most 
important thing is to make your photos and Web pages look good and download 
quickly on the Internet. A clean, classic design will almost always look more pro­
fessional than a busy design loaded with blinking or animated images.
	
✓	Location: The position of elements on a page can strongly affect the amount of 
attention they receive. Many Internet studies have shown that text and images 
toward the top of the page get the most attention, which is why putting your 
most content toward the top of the page is best. Some things are commonly 
placed at the bottom of Web pages, including copyright information and links 
to legal notices, such as privacy information or terms and conditions.
	
✓	Prominence: Give elements of similar importance the same weight on a page, 
and change the prominence based on priority. If all your headlines are the 
same size, it’s hard to tell what’s most important, which is why most news 
sites and print publications use larger text for the biggest news stories and 
smaller and smaller headlines for less important news.

31
 Chapter 2: Planning Makes Web Design Easier
	
Here’s the exception to the rule. Strive for consistency in your designs except when 
you’re trying to be unpredictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web 
site lively. A touch of red or a special icon can bring attention to a special section or 
newly updated information.
Mapping the structure: Organization, 
navigation, and links
Helping visitors find their way around your site is a critical part of your site’s 
design. As you start planning the organization of your home page and the main sec­
tions of your site, consider these questions:
	
✓	When visitors arrive at your home page, how will they find what’s most impor­
tant to them?
	
✓	How can you divide the information in your site into sections?
	
✓	How will visitors move from one section of the site to another?
	
✓	How will you encourage visitors to find the information that you most want 
them to find or to take the action you want them to take (such as buying a 
product or ordering your services)?
A good way to help answer these questions is to imagine that you’re a typical user 
of your site. For example, you might say, “If I were a busy attorney who came to my 
site looking for a new couch for my living room, what would make it easy for me to 
find the color and style I want in my office?” Or, “If I had a shaggy dog that needed a 
haircut every week, how could I easily find the scheduling and pricing information 
for the grooming salon?”
As you plan what appears on the first page of your site, draw on your answers to 
these questions, and revisit the exercise throughout the design process to make 
sure that your most important visitors can easily find what they need. In fact, here’s 
a great practice professional designers use: Create a few profiles of typical users 
and then return to these profiles as you design the site.
Designing the home page and main sections
One of the biggest mistakes in Web design is cramming your home page so full of 
information that it’s hard to find anything. Studies show it’s better to guide people 
through a series of simple choices with two to five options each, than to overwhelm 
them with all options at once.
	
As you consider what information you want to appear on the home page and how 
to organize the information in your site into subsections, think about guiding your 
most important visitors through a series of choices. For example, Pamela’s Pet 
Services site might include a few general service categories on the home page, such 
as grooming, boarding, and walking, and then link to subsections that offer more 
specific information, organized by the kind of pet or grooming service.

32
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
As you plan your initial site structure, think also about where you’re likely to add 
content down the road. Be sure to include these considerations in the planning pro­
cess by asking questions, such as these:
	
✓	For a site that sells products: What will you do when you have more products 
to add? Where will you put new lines of products? How will you locate new 
product information pages or more detailed descriptions? How will you handle 
price changes or inventory fluctuations?
	
✓	For an online magazine: How will you handle breaking news? Where will you 
add new stories on a regular basis? How will you archive old stories? How will 
you connect related stories over time?
	
✓	For a service site, like my fictional Pamela’s Pet Service: Where will you add 
new services? How will you add new photos of pets? Where will you include 
seasonal specials or discounts?
	
Whatever you do, never let users “get stuck” on a page because the link is broken or 
labeled Under Construction. Good Web sites are always under construction. Let 
visitors know that new treats are coming by putting notices on pages that already 
have content. You find more about creating links in Chapter 6 and tips about finding 
and fixing broken links in Chapter 10.
Setting up navigation links
After you determine how you’re going to organize your information into sections on 
your site, you’ve done most of the work needed to create the navigational structure 
of your site. Creating a menu bar — or navigation bar — that includes links to each 
main section of your site is one of the most important ways you can make your site 
easy to navigate. Adding that same navigation bar to every page on your site makes 
it easy to access all of the main sections from anywhere within the site.
Here’s an example of a navigation bar you might create with a row of links to the 
main sections of a small business site:
Home Page ~ About Us ~ Products ~ Services ~ Contact Info
	
A good Web site is designed so that users can easily access key information from more 
than one place in the site and can also move back and forth between the main sections.
As you plan the navigation of your site, make sure that visitors can
	
✓	Follow different paths to the same important information. Providing more 
than one link to the same page can seem repetitive but makes it easier for 
visitors to find their way around your site. For example, if you have a family 
history section, you might link to that page from pages throughout your site, 
such as the page about your daughter’s wedding as well as the page about 
your grandparents.

33
 Chapter 2: Planning Makes Web Design Easier
	
✓	Move back and forth between pages and sections. Links that help users move 
forward and backward through a series of related pages can be especially 
useful in a slide show or an image gallery.
	
✓	Search your site. If your Web site is packed with content, users are likely to 
appreciate the ability to search through your pages. One simple solution is the 
Google Search tools, which you use for free by signing up at Google.com and 
copying a little bit of code from their site to yours. (You find instructions for 
adding Google AdSense to your pages, which works much like Google Search, 
in Chapter 14.)
	
Follow the three-clicks rule, which states that no important piece of information 
should ever be more than three clicks away from anywhere else on your Web site. 
And the most important information — such as contact information — should never 
be more than one click away.

Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
In This Chapter
▶	 Selecting a domain name
▶	 Registering a domain name
▶	 Understanding how Web hosting works
▶	 Choosing a hosting service
A
 schoolteacher once asked me: “When you talk about ‘there’ on the 
 Internet, where’s ‘there?’” I knew immediately what she meant, but I’ve 
pondered her question ever since.
If you’re still trying to understand “where” your Web site will live when you’re 
ready to share it with the world — and how domain names and Web servers fit into 
your Web site plans — you’ve turned to the right chapter. Simply put, a domain 
name is the address for your Web site, and a Web server (often provided by a host­
ing service) is a computer with special software that makes it possible for you to 
publish your site on the Web.
Although many companies offer both domain registration and Web servers, regis­
tering a domain name is very different from setting up a server to host your Web 
site. In this chapter, you find out how these two important aspects of Web develop­
ment work and how to get the best domain and hosting service for your Web site.
In the first part of this chapter, you discover how domain name registration works, 
where you can search for domain names to see what’s available, and what to do if 
the name you want is already taken. In the second part of this chapter, you find tips 
about choosing the best Web server so you can publish your site online.
Whether you’re creating a Web site for your business, hobby, or family, you’ll 
want to follow the steps in this chapter to register a domain name and select a 
Web server. Taking care of the preliminary steps in this chapter before you start 
creating your pages in Part II will help ensure that everything is set up when you’re 
ready to launch your new Web site.
Finding and Registering Domain Names
The address for a Web site is its domain name, also called the URL or Uniform 
Resource Locator. For example, Wiley Publishing, the company that published this 
book, has a Web site with the domain name www.wiley.com. The company also has a 
Web site with the domain name www.dummies.com, for the For Dummies book series.

36
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Even before you start building a Web site, I recommend that you register your own 
domain name. The process is simple and painless and costs less than $10 per year 
at most domain registration services. If you don’t register a domain name, your 
Web site’s address will probably look something like this:
www.serviceprovider.com/users/yourname
If you register a domain name, your address should look more like this:
www.wiley.com
Choosing a good domain name
	
Your domain name is your calling card, and the best ones are short and sweet and 
easy to spell. If your Web address is too long or complex, it’s hard for anyone to 
remember or type accurately on a keyboard. The best domain name for your site will 
be easy to remember and easy to convey: It can be said in one simple sentence.
A shortened version of your business name may seem like a better choice because it 
requires less typing, but if your customers know you by your full name, they may be 
confused. For example, I would never recommend a domain such as am-airlines.
com for American Airlines. The official site for American Airlines is www.aa.com, 
which is a great domain because the company’s initials are well known, and you 
couldn’t possibly get a much shorter domain name. Because www.aa.com is an 
abbreviation, American Airlines was smart enough to recognize it might be confus­
ing to visitors and to register more than one name (it’s easy to do); if you type www.
americanairlines.com, your browser goes to the same site.
When you’re tossing around ideas for a domain name, keep these rules in mind:
	
✓	Domain names aren’t case sensitive. For example, you can get to my Web 
design training site by entering digitalfamily.com or DigitalFamily.
com. (See Figure 3-1.) I prefer to capitalize the D and F in my domain name 
when I print it on business cards or other collateral because it makes the 
domain name easier to read.
Figure 3-1: Both DigitalFamily.com and digitalfamily.com 
take you to the same Web site.

37
 Chapter 3: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
	
✓	Any characters that appear after a domain name extension are case 
sensitive (the dot-com or dot-org part of the address, for example). Thus, 
www.DigitalFamily.com/books isn’t the same address as www.
DigitalFamily.com/Books.
	
✓	Use of the leading www depends on how the domain is configured on a server. 
You can set up a domain on a Web server to work with or without the www, or 
you can set it up to work either way. You can also set up subdomains if you own 
a domain. For example, you can find my personal profile at http://JCWarner.
com, and you can find the Spanish version at http://spanish.JCWarner.com.
	
✓	The use of the http:// that appears at the very beginning of a domain name 
is optional. Most people no longer type these initial characters when entering a 
Web address because they’re unnecessary, but it is helpful to include them when 
you’re writing an address that doesn’t include the www. Throughout this book, 
when I write a domain that does not include the 3ws, I include the http:// to 
avoid confusion.
	
✓	Although you can use a hyphen or an underscore in a domain name, it’s 
generally simpler to use a combination of words run together. For example, 
you can register www.digital-family.com, but that’s harder to convey 
verbally because you have to explain the hyphens in the middle. If you simply 
use www.digitalfamily.com, you can say, “My address is Digital Family dot 
com, all one word.”
	
✓	Domain names cannot contain special characters. You can’t use spaces, peri­
ods, apostrophes, or other punctuation or special characters, but you can use 
numbers and dashes.
	
✓	Make sure that your domain name doesn’t violate a trademark. You can do 
a simple trademark search at www.uspto.gov. If you’re starting a business or 
concerned about violating someone’s trademark, consult an attorney.
Register your name
I tell all my friends that they should register 
their own names as domain names because 
“owning” your name is a key part of pro­
tecting your online reputation. A personal 
Web site serves as a great way to promote 
yourself, whether you’re job hunting, devel­
oping a consulting business, or simply want 
to share your story with the world. And 
because search engines tend to give prior­
ity to keywords that match domain names, 
your site should score high when someone 
searches your name if you’ve registered the 
domain. And even if you don’t plan to use 
your domain name right away, registering 
it will prevent anyone else from setting up 
a site with your name.
I registered my own name, JanineWarner.
com, years ago. When I realized that many 
people misspell my first name, though, I 
decided to register a simpler alternative. 
The domain jwarner.com was already reg­
istered by a gentleman named John Warner 
when I got the idea, but he’s been nice 
enough to keep a link on his site for me. I 
finally settled on JCWarner.com because 
it’s easier for people to spell the domain 
using my middle initial than using my full 
first name. I know that even if someone 
misses the C in my domain, they still have 
a good chance to find my site thanks to the 
link on John’s site. (Thanks, John!)

38
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Searching for an available domain name
You can register any domain name that hasn’t already been taken by someone else. 
Finding out whether a name is already in use is easy — and free. To see whether 
a domain name is already registered, do a simple search at any domain registra­
tion Web site. All domain registrars check the same master databases that track all 
domain names on the Web. Hundreds of sites offer the service; the following steps 
use Domain.com as an example, but most work the same way:
	
1.	Use a Web browser to visit a domain name registrar.
	
	 In this example, I’m using Domain.com (www.domain.com).
	
2.	In the Search area on the registrar’s site, type the name you want to register.
	
	 In Figure 3-2, I’m searching for www.petservice.com.
	
3.	Click to begin your search.
	
	 The results of your search are displayed. (If you use Domain.com, for example, 
you’ll see a list that includes the name you searched for, as well as a list of 
variations. Most common names and phrases have already been registered, so 
it’s no surprise that the status next to the name petservice.com shows that 
it’s already taken. If you scroll down the list of alternatives shown in Figure 3-2, 
you see that petservice.us is still available, as is thepetservice.net.
	
4.	If the name you want isn’t available and you don’t like the alternatives 
offered, you can enter another name to see whether it’s available.
	
	Domain registrars don’t limit the number of names you can search for in any 
given search session.
Figure 3-2: If the name you want isn’t available, most registrars, such as 
Domain.com, offer a list of recommended alternatives.

39
 Chapter 3: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
	
Don’t get frustrated if you find that the domain name you want is already taken. You 
can almost always find a name that will serve you well if you get creative and try a 
few variations. Here are a few tips for finding a suitable variation:
	
✓	Add a word or phrase that indicates geographic location or makes the name 
more specific. For example, if www.news.com is taken, consider using www.
PointReyesNews.com or www.WestMarinNews.com.
	
✓	Sometimes a different name that has similar meaning can work. For example, 
if every variation of news is taken, consider registering a similar name, such as 
www.PointReyesReports.com.
	
✓	Try looking for playful names. For example, www.Accountant.com is 
taken, but you might still find www.FunnyAccountants.com or www.
FrugalAccountants.com.
	
Before you choose a close variation (or any domain name, for that matter), always 
check for sites whose names are similar to yours. It’s generally not a good idea 
to choose a name that’s too close to someone else’s if that person is a competi­
tor or runs a site you would be embarrassed to be associated with. Similarly, 
consider whether others have already set up sites with your domain name but 
a different domain name ending. It may seem like a good alternative to regis­
ter FrugalAccountants.net if the .com version is already taken. However, 
because the .com ending is more common, you’re likely to lose customers to 
FrugalAccounts.com if they offer a competitive service. If you really want 
a domain name that’s been taken, check out the sidebar, “Disputing a domain 
name,” later in this chapter, which explains how you can purchase a domain 
name that has already been registered from the owner (if he or she is willing 
to negotiate).
Understanding top-level domains
When you search for a domain name, you need to determine not only the first part 
of the name but also the ending, commonly called the top-level domain, or TLD. 
Table 3-1 provides a list of the most common domain name endings, their intended 
purposes, and their restrictions.
The .com domain has emerged as the most valuable because it’s the best recog­
nized and the one that people are most likely to remember. However, all these 
domains work the same way in terms of directing users to a Web site address. For 
example, www.smith.com, www.smith.net, and www.smith.org work the same 
way on the Internet and are used by three different Web sites.
	
The number of domain endings has been growing, and there are proposals to make 
the options nearly unlimited. Table 3-1 provides a list of the most common domain 
unrestricted names as well as the original list of restricted names. (ICANN controls 
all domain names and; only an entity that’s approved to use a restricted ending can 
set up a domain name with that ending.)

Comparing country domains: .tv, .us, and .ws
Nearly every country in the world now has its own domain, such as .us for the 
United States, .am for Armenia, .br for Brazil, .uk for the United Kingdom, and 
.zw for Zimbabwe.
A few foreign country codes have become popular in the United States because 
they represent common acronyms, such as .tv. Many folks mistakenly assume that 
.tv stands for television, but it’s really the domain name for the country of Tuvalu. 
Similarly, .ws is often assumed to mean Web site (and is even listed that way on 
some registrar sites), but it’s really the country code for Western Samoa. You can 
register a name with the .ws or .tv domain even if you don’t live in one of those 
countries, but some countries have restrictions, and country domains are generally 
more expensive to register than names that use .com, .net, or .org.
Registering your domain name
The specifics of registering a domain name vary among the services, but the basic 
domain registration process is similar. Typically, after you perform your search, 
you’re given instructions for registering the name, as well as offers to buy other kinds 

41
 Chapter 3: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
of services, such as Web hosting. You should never have to purchase additional ser­
vices to register a domain name, but many companies offer discounts if you order 
multiple services. Common types of services, in addition to registration, are
	
✓	Hosting: Many registration services also offer Web site hosting (covered later 
in this chapter).
	
✓	E-mail: Typically, you have the option of creating one or more e-mail 
addresses associated with your domain name, but e-mail set-up is often better 
handled through your Web hosting service.
	
✓	Privacy: Most services allow you to choose whether your contact informa­
tion as the owner of this domain name is readily available to others through 
a search on the Whois database (http://www.whois.net). Most services 
charge a fee for private registration, which is kind of like having an unlisted 
phone number.
Disputing a domain name
What if your name — either your personal 
name or your company name — is already 
taken, and you want to have it (or don’t like 
what someone else is doing with it)?
Unless the owner has opted for private 
registration, you can find out who owns 
a domain name by searching the Whois 
database, a central registry of all domain 
registrants on the Internet. Most domain 
registration sites include a More Info link in 
the results page if you search for a domain 
name that is already taken. Registration 
listings in the Whois database include the 
street address, phone number, and e-mail 
address of the person or business that 
registered the domain name in addition to 
information about the server or service pro­
vider that hosts the domain.
If you have your heart set on a domain 
name that is already registered, you can 
contact the owner and try negotiating. 
Many people have registered names that 
they aren’t using, and if you find one that’s 
registered but not in use, the owner might 
be willing to sell. I know many people who 
have picked up great domain names for 
$500 to $1,000, but some names have sold 
for as much as $1 million.
There is no clear set of rules about the value 
of a domain name, but there are services at 
registrations sites, such as www.godaddy.
com and www.1and1.com, that will appraise 
a domain name or even broker an offer to 
the current owner.
To date, the courts seem to be apply­
ing the same laws to domain names that 
they apply to trademarks. For example, if 
you have a legal trademark such as Levi, 
and someone registers www.levi.com 
before you do, you can probably go to 
court and force the person to give you the 
domain name, although domain name 
disputes can be lengthy and expensive. 
If you don’t have a trademark, you may 
have no alternative than to try to buy it 
from the person or choose another name 
instead.
If you think you have a case against some­
one who has taken your name, don’t bother 
the registration service with your complaint. 
Domain registrars don’t handle domain 
name disputes; they just register names on 
a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, talk 
to the guilty party directly. If that doesn’t 
work, take the matter to court. If you can get 
a judge to rule that you’re right, the domain 
registration service revokes the name and 
lets you have it.

42
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
In addition to registering your main domain name — the one you plan to hand 
out to colleagues and clients or friends and family — my best advice is to regis­
ter every variation and misspelling of your name that you can think of and direct 
those domain names to your Web site. Just because some people didn’t do well in 
the third grade spelling bee doesn’t mean that they don’t have money to buy your 
products or services online.
Directing more than one domain name to the same Web site is a relatively simple 
technical detail that you can arrange through your Internet service provider (ISP) 
or the company where you register the name. And, it’s not that expensive. At 
the time of this writing, GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com) charges $9.99 per year, 
Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com) charge, $14.99 per year, and 
1&1 (www.1and1.com) charges $5.99 per year.
Also consider registering the same name with different domain endings, such as 
.org, .net — and, most important, .com. The educational Web site Whyville, for 
example, registered whyville.org (the domain ending used by most nonprofits), 
but it also registered whyville.com because many people will assume that’s the 
address. Owning these additional domains can also prevent you or your visitors 
from potential embarrassment or misrepresentation.
Most people consider the .com version of a name the most valuable, but if the .com 
version is unavailable, registering the .net, .biz, or .info versions may be a fine 
alternative. Just make sure that the site that has the .com version isn’t a direct com­
petitor or a site that you would be embarrassed by if your visitors found it accidentally.
	
Technically, when you register a domain name, you are leasing it, not purchasing 
it, which means that it’s possible to lose a domain name. Make sure that your regis­
tration remains valid by renewing it when your registration service requires. Many 
registrars offer auto-renewal options and discounts for registering a name for two or 
more years in advance.
Choosing a Web Hosting Service
Choosing a Web host is a little like choosing a cellphone company or a long distance 
carrier. In theory, all phone companies provide the same ability to make a phone call, 
but in practice, they offer different rate plans and different levels of service.
For the purposes of this book, I’m going to assume that you don’t want to run your 
own Web server, which would be kind of like starting your own phone company 
when all you need is long-distance service. Unless you’re running an extremely 
large Web site, you should definitely look for what’s called “managed hosting.”
Essentially, when you sign up with a Web host, you’re renting a small portion of a 
big computer (a Web server) that’s connected to the Internet. The host gives you 
access to your part of that computer’s hard drive, and when you transfer your Web 
pages to their computer, they are “served” to the Internet.
Although you can use the same service to host your site that you used to register 
your domain name, I’ve had better experiences with companies that make Web 
hosting their top priority. For example, Liquid Web (as shown in Figure 3-3) offers 
24/7 phone support, a service you won’t find at all Web hosting companies.

43
 Chapter 3: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
Figure 3-3: Look for a company that makes Web hosting a priority and 
offers good technical support.
If you’re looking for one of the cheapest Web hosting services, consider 1&1 or 
GoDaddy, both offer domain registration and a variety of low-cost Web hosting 
options, for as little as 4.99 per month. If you want to use one of the best hosting 
companies I’ve found to date and you’re willing to pay between $25 and $100 per 
month for an account, consider www.rackspace.com.
So how do you find a Web host with the features you need for your Web site? And, 
how do you even know what to ask?
Before you select a Web host, consider what you want on your Web site and make 
sure that you find a service that meets your needs. Your goal is to find the provider 
with the best collection of services within your budget. The following sections high­
light a few questions to ask as you explore your Web hosting options.
Finding the best host for your site
My best advice is to get a good start on the development plan for your site before 
you shop around for a service provider so that you know which kinds of services you 
need. (You can find more information about planning a Web project in Chapter 2.) 
You might decide, for example, that you want 24-hour technical support so that you 
can get help at night after work, but you don’t want to pay extra for secure financial 
transactions because you don’t plan to sell products online.
Here are a few of the common features to consider as you select a Web hosting 
service:
	
✓	Bandwidth: Bandwidth measures the carrying capacity of a connection on the 
Internet. Compare bandwidth with a garden hose and its capacity to transport 
water: the larger the diameter of the hose, the more water it can carry. Bandwidth 
works the same way: the greater the bandwidth, the faster the transmission of 

44
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
information. Bandwidth gets expensive if lots of people visit your site because 
more visitors mean more use of the connection. If you want to offer streaming 
video or audio files, they can also use up a lot of bandwidth — and that means 
you’ll have to pay a premium for hosting.
	
✓	Disk space: The bigger your site — the more images and especially the more 
sound files, video, and animation files you include — the more you’ll pay for the 
disk space to host it. Because video files are much larger than images or text files, 
video takes up much more hard disk space and requires more bandwidth to be 
viewed. As a result, providing many hours of video on your site can be expensive.
	
✓	E-commerce: Some Web hosting packages include secure e-commerce capa­
bilities and sophisticated programming options. Unless you’re planning to 
sell products or services on your site or to publish large amounts of video or 
sound files, you’ll probably do fine with the simplest or lowest-level Web host­
ing package your service provider offers.
	
✓	Blogs and other third-party services: You can install blogging software, such 
as WordPress (covered in Chapter 11) on almost any Web server, but many 
hosts include a feature that makes it easy to install blogging and other soft­
ware. Some call this one-click services; others use a program called Fantastico, 
which is included in your Web hosting service. The advantage is that it makes 
it easy to set up a blog (and many other programs) on your own server, which 
is something that can get complicated if you have to do it yourself.
	
✓	Unix, Linux versus Microsoft Web hosting: Some service providers use Linux 
server software; others use Microsoft. If you use the templates included in this 
book, either type of server should work fine, but if you create a WordPress 
blog or other service or system that requires programming language, you’ll 
want to make sure your server supports it. The most common technologies 
used in the Web these days are PHP, JSP, and Perl, which work well on Linux 
servers, and ASP or ASP.NET, which work only on Microsoft servers.
	
✓	Streaming media: If you want to offer audio, video, or Flash animations on 
your Web site, check whether your hosting service features the ability to 
stream your multimedia files. It’s a nice option: Streaming is what enables site 
visitors to start playing a video or audio file while it is downloading, instead of 
having to wait for the entire file to download before it can start. Keep in mind, 
however, that you can use a third-party service to host your video, avoid­
ing the potential cost and challenges of hosting video on your own server. 
YouTube offers free hosting for short videos and it’s easy to insert videos 
hosted on YouTube on your own pages. You’ll find a slightly higher-level 
service from Vimeo (www.vimeo.com). (You find more information about 
these and other services in Chapter 13.)
	
	If your Web host sets a limit on bandwidth usage, you can end up with a big, 
unexpected bill if a video or audio file on your site becomes very popular. For 
example, I have a client on a premium Web host that offers excellent service 
but sets a limit on the bandwidth included in their monthly fee. If just one of 
their high-quality videos got popular enough to attract a million visitors in one 
month (which is not so unusual on the Web), they could get hit with a $12,000 
bill, just for that month of video hosting. That’s why I recommend a dedicated 
video host for anyone who does video on their Web site. With www.vimeo.
com, one of the most popular video services, you upload your videos to Vimeo 
and then simply copy a piece of code to your own site and then it plays within 
the page on your Web site. (You learn more about video hosting services, such 
as Vimeo and YouTube, in Chapter 13.)

45
 Chapter 3: Securing a Domain Name and Web Host
Setting up e-commerce service
Many Web hosting services, such as those provided by Yahoo!, as shown in Figure 3-4, 
provide e-commerce features in addition to hosting and domain registration all in one 
place. If you’re thinking of starting a business or taking your existing retail business 
online, you want to make sure your service provider can handle e-commerce trans­
actions. If you plan to sell a lot of products, I also recommend using a shopping cart 
system, which is a program that enables visitors to add products to a checkout page 
that tracks and tallies selected items as a visitor moves through your site. You can 
buy shopping cart systems separately, but many service providers (such as Yahoo!) 
include shopping cart features as part of their online store services. (You can find 
more information about selling products on the Web in Chapter 14.)
Figure 3-4: Some Web hosting services, such as Yahoo!, provide e-commerce capabilities.
Hosting multiple sites with 
different domain names
As you compare options, you might notice that some providers charge more for 
packages that enable you to host multiple domain names. You might choose a pack­
age that supports multiple domain names if you want each member of the family to 
be able to register their own domain name and set up their own site separately or if 
you run multiple companies or information sites. For example, you can set up www.
JeanDoherty.com, www.JoshDoherty.com, and www.TheDohertyFamily.com 
as separate sites on the same account if it supports multiple domains. Although 
a Web hosting package that supports multiple domain names is generally more 
expensive, it might save you money compared with the cost of setting up a different 
Web hosting account for each Web site you want to create.

46
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
	
Note the difference between hosting multiple domain names that point to different Web 
sites, as in the example in the preceding paragraph, and pointing two or more domain 
names to the same site. If you want two names (such as www.TheDohertyFamily.
com and www.TheDohertys.com) to direct visitors to the same site, you can manage 
that situation with your domain name registrar and save the cost of a premium Web 
server account that supports multiple domain names. Check with your domain name 
registrar for more information on how to forward multiple domain names to the 
same Web server.

▶	 Understanding Web design and layout options
▶	 Exploring HTML and XHTML
▶	 Styling Web pages with CSS
I
n the early days of the Web, designers were limited to a few simple page layout 
options — you could center your text and images, or leave it all aligned to the 
left. As HTML evolved, creating great, more complex Web designs became possible, 
but finding the best solution became a lot more confusing.
If you’ve done any Web design in the past, you may have used tables, frames, or 
layers to create page layouts. Today, all those options are considered outdated and 
are generally no longer recommended except in very special cases.
Today, most professional designers agree that the best way to create a Web page 
design is to use XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language, a strict form of 
HTML) with Cascading Style Sheets (better known by the acronym CSS).
If you’re starting to worry that this book is getting a lot more technical than you 
expected, relax. I assure you, you don’t need to learn any advanced programming 
to create a Web site with the templates included with this book. That said, I find 
that many people like to know more about how all this works, and that’s what this 
chapter is about — helping you better understand the choices, why CSS is better 
than almost any other design option and how CSS and XTHML work together.
	
If you’re ready to dive in and start building your Web site right away, feel free to 
jump ahead to the chapter and templates for the site design you want to create. You 
can always come back here for more details later.
HTM-what? Exploring HTML and XHTML
Contrary to popular belief, HTML isn’t a programming language. Rather, it’s a mark-up 
language: That is, HTML is designed to “mark up” a page, or to provide instructions 
for how a Web page should look. HTML is written by using tags, markup instructions 
that tell a Web browser how the page should be displayed. For example, to make a sec­
tion of text italic, you use the HTML tag <em>, which stands for emphasis. Most tags 
in HTML include both an opening tag and a close tag, indicated by the forward slash /. 
Thus, to make the name of this book appear in italics, I would write the code like this:
<strong>Web Sites Do It Yourself For Dummies.</strong>

48
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
XHTML is a more strict version of HTML that is the recommended language to use 
to meet the highest standards of Web design today. Among the differences between 
the two languages, XHTML must be written in lowercase letters; in HTML, it doesn’t 
matter whether tags are upper or lowercase. Similarly, XHTML requires that all tags 
include a close tag (more on that later in this chapter.) Rest assured all templates 
and code examples in this book follow the XHTML standard.
To see what the code behind a Web page looks like in most browsers, choose 
View➪Source. If you’re using Dreamweaver, as shown in Figure 4-1, you can click 
the Split button (upper-left corner of the workspace) to see the code and the design 
areas of the program at the same time in Split view.
	
Split view in Dreamweaver is a useful way to keep an eye on what’s going on behind 
the scenes and, as a bonus, you can learn a lot of XHTML as you go along.
Dreamweaver offers three view options:
	
✓	Code: In Code view, you see only the XHTML and other code.
	
✓	Split: In Split view, the page is divided so you can see the code in one part of 
the workspace, and a view of the how the page should be displayed in a Web 
browser in the other part.
	
✓	Design: In Design view, you only see the page as it should be displayed in a 
Web browser.
In Dreamweaver’s Split view, Code and Design views are completely integrated, so 
if you select something in Design view, like the headline you see in Figure 4-1, the 
same text is highlighted in Code view, making it easy to find your place in the code.
If at first glance you think that XHTML code looks like hieroglyphics, don’t give 
up too quickly. With just a little training, you can start to recognize at least some 
common tags, like the <h1> tag (heading 1 tag) that was used to format the head­
line on the page shown in Figure 4-2.
	
To help distinguish the code in a Web page from the text, Dreamweaver displays the 
tags in a contrasting color, usually blue. You can change the size, color, font, and 
other features of the code in Dreamweaver’s preferences.
Building, testing, and publishing a Web site
In a nutshell, building a Web site involves 
creating a home page (often called the front 
page) that links to other pages representing 
different sections of the site. Those pages, 
in turn, can link to subsections that can then 
lead to additional subsections or individual 
pages. After you create a Web site, you can 
test all the links on your own hard drive 
and then upload the pages to a Web server 
when everything is ready and working well. 
You can read more about Web servers in 
Chapter 2 and how to upload your pages to 
a server in Chapter 10.

A few points to help you better understand XHTML:
	
✓	In XHTML, all tags must include the closing slash. A few tags can stand alone, 
such as the <br /> tag, which adds a line break. XHTML tags must have a 
closing tag, even if there is only one tag, and close tags always contain a for­
ward slash (/). As a result, the line break tag in HTML looks like <br>, but in 
XHTML, it looks like <br />.
	
✓	XHTML includes many tags that are designed to be hierarchical. Examples 
are the <h1> through <h6> (heading 6) tags, which are ideally suited to for­
matting text according to its importance on a Web page. Reserve the <h1> 
tag for the most important text on the page, such as the top headline. <h2> is 
ideal for subheads or secondary headings, <h3> for the third level of headings, 
and so on. A headline formatted with the <h1> tag looks like this:
<h1>This is a headline</h1>

50
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
	
✓	Some tags are more complex, and the open and close tags don’t always 
match. More complicated tags, such as the tags used to create links or insert 
images into pages, are more challenging to use because they include link infor­
mation, and the close tag doesn’t always match the open tag. For example, the 
code to create a link to another Web site looks like this:
<a href=”http://www.digitalfamily.com”>This is a link to 
DigitalFamily.com</a>
	
At its heart, XHTML is just text, and believe it or not, you can write XHTML in a plain-
text editor as simple as Notepad, SimpleText, or TextEdit. If you ever try it, however, 
you have to be careful to type all the code perfectly because there is no room for 
error or typos in XHTML. After writing code yourself, even to create a simple page, 
you’re sure to quickly appreciate programs — such as Dreamweaver — that write 
the code for you.
One of the great advantages of using Dreamweaver is that you can specify format­
ting by clicking buttons or using menu commands, and Dreamweaver takes care of 
writing the XHTML code for you. For this and many other reasons, I chose to use 
Dreamweaver in this book.
	
If you prefer to use Expression Web, a similar program created by Microsoft, you can 
apply most of the instructions in this book to that program, although some of the 
menu items and other features are located in different places. If you do choose to 
use Expression Web, you can download specially created templates and instructions 
for creating all the template designs in this book on the companion Web site at www.
DigitalFamily.com/diy.
Comparing Tables, Frames, and Layers
If you’ve already done a little Web design, you may be wondering what happened 
to some of the old ways of creating Web page layouts. For years, Web designers 
used the HTML feature called Tables to create page layouts. Then, Frames came 
along, and many people were excited by the ability to display multiple pages in one 
browser window, which is possible when using Frames and iFrames. Then came 
Layers, which were especially popular among designers because they seemed to 
offer precise design control.
How Web browsers work
Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, Chrome, and Safari are designed to 
decipher HTML, XHTML, CSS, AJAX, and 
other code and display the corresponding 
text, images, and multimedia on a com­
puter screen. Essentially, browsers read 
the code in a Web page and interpret how 
the page should be displayed to visitors. 
Unfortunately, because Web browsers are 
created by different companies and the 
code they display has evolved dramatically 
over the years, not all Web browsers dis­
play Web pages the same way. Differences 
in browser display can lead to unpredict­
able (and often frustrating) results because 
a page that looks good in one browser may 
be unreadable in another. For more infor­
mation on browser differences and testing 
your pages to make sure they look good to 
all your visitors, see Chapter 10.

51
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
Over the years, all these options have become less desirable except in a few special 
cases. In this section, you find a quick review of when Tables, Frames, and Layers 
may still be useful.
Creating page designs with HTML Tables
In the early days of Web design, most page layouts on the Web were created with 
tables. By merging and splitting table cells, and even adding background images, you 
can create complex Web designs with tables. CSS expands upon this concept by adding 
many new design options, including the ability to precisely add margins and padding 
around elements, and better control how and where background images appear.
Cascading Style Sheets, better known by the acronym CSS, also enables you to keep 
formatting information separate from content, making it possible to use less code 
and create pages with smaller file sizes that download more quickly. Using CSS also 
makes pages easier to update because you can change formatting in a more stream­
lined way. You can read more about CSS in the upcoming section, “Designing with 
Cascading Style Sheets.”
Figure 4-3 provides an example of an old-school site created with the HTML table 
tag. To help you appreciate how this page was created, I altered the original design 
to display the table borders although most designers turn off table borders when 
using tables to create cleaner layouts. Setting the table border to 0 (instead of 2 as 
I did here to show you the borders), makes it possible to turn off the border of a 
table so that it doesn’t interfere with the design.
	
If you visit the site at www.chocolategamerules.com, you can see how this same 
page was created using div tags and CSS. (I explain how div tags work within CSS in 
“Designing with Cascading Style Sheets” later in this chapter.)
Figure 4-3: In the old days, the only way you could create a complex Web page design 
was to use an HTML table to control text and image placement.

52
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Although tables are no longer recommended for creating page layouts, they’re still 
considered the best way to format tabular data like you’d find in a spreadsheet pro­
gram. That means that you can use tables to format a consistent collection of infor­
mation, such as the photos and names in the list of winners from the Chocolate 
Game Rules site shown in Figure 4-4.
Although I recommend that you redesign sites like the one shown in Figure 4-3 with 
CSS and div tags, I do understand that many designers still find it easier to create 
layouts with tables, and not everyone has time to redesign their Web sites right 
away. I have to admit, I’ve been guilty of leaving a few sites online designed with 
tables long after I knew better. That said, I recommend using only CSS today for all 
your Web page layouts except when you are creating a layout for tabular data. Even 
then, I still urge you to use CSS to add any styling, such as background colors or 
padding, that you might want in your tables.
Figure 4-4: Tables are still considered the best way to display tabular data 
like the information on this contest page.
Considering design options with HTML frames
You won’t find any instructions in this book for creating Web sites that use frames, 
such as the Pink Flamingos site shown in Figure 4-5. Frames enable you to display 
multiple Web pages in one browser window. Among Web designers, Frames are a 
little like those plastic pink flamingos stuck in the front yards of so many homes in 
South Florida; some people love how kitsch they are, and others just think they are 
tacky. Although Frames are still used on the Web, most designers don’t like them 
because they can make navigation confusing.

53
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
	
Frames are also problematic because when you use frames, the URL at the top of a 
Web browser does not change, even when you click links and change the pages dis­
played within frames. As a result, you can only bookmark, or create a link to, the first 
page of a site that uses frames. Worse yet, frames make it harder for search engines 
to index a site properly, which can diminish your search engine ranking.
Figure 4-5: Frames enable you to display multiple Web pages in one browser window.
Using Layers (or AP Divs) to create designs
Dreamweaver MX, MX 2004, and 8 had a button for the layer feature, and it offered 
an easy way to click and drag boxes using divs that were positioned with precision 
on a page. In later versions of Dreamweaver, the name was changed to AP Divs. 
Divs are simply XHTML tags that serve as dividers in a page. Essentially, they create 
boxes around content that make it easier to position sections of text or images 
independently. Don’t be confused by the fact that I (and most other Web designers 
today) recommend using Div tags with CSS to create your page layouts. We just 
don’t recommend that you do so with the AP Divs.
AP Divs, as the name implies, are Div tags that include styling information that 
adds absolute positioning. That means that when you place an AP Div in a Web 
page, it stays where you put it, no matter how much space you have in the browser 
window. That may seem like a good idea at first, and AP Divs were popular among 
some designers for a while because they are so easy to use and so similar to many 
of the features in desktop publishing programs (such as Adobe InDesign). But 
because layers create such inflexible layouts, they don’t adapt well to the changing 
environment of the Web where different sized monitors and other display varia­
tions can lead to text getting cut off and other undesirable results.

54
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
To cut down on the confusion caused by the term layers, Adobe changed the name 
of this feature from layers to AP Divs (short for Absolutely Positioned Div tags) in 
later versions of Dreamweaver, including CS3 and CS4. Many designers use AP Divs 
on occasion to add fixed position elements to a layout, but creating an entire design 
with this feature is no longer recommended.
Designing with Cascading Style Sheets
The concept of creating styles has been around since long before the Web. Desktop 
publishing programs (such as Adobe InDesign) and even word processing pro­
grams (such as Microsoft Word) have long used styles to manage the formatting 
and editing of text on printed pages. When using styles in a word processor, you 
can create and save styles for common features, such as headlines and captions. In 
print design, styles are great timesavers because they enable you to combine a col­
lection of formatting options (such as Arial and bold and italic) into one style and 
then apply all those options at once to any selected text in your document by using 
only a single style. The advantage is that if you change a style, you can automati­
cally apply the change everywhere you’ve used that style in a document.
On the Web, you can do all that and more with CSS because you can use style 
sheets for even more than just text formatting. For example, you can use CSS 
to create styles that align images to the left or right side of a page, add padding 
around text or images, and change background and link colors. You can even create 
more than one style sheet for the same page — say, one that makes your design 
look good on computers, another for cellphones, and a third for a printed page.
For all these reasons (and more), CSS has quickly become the preferred method of 
designing Web pages among professional Web designers. One of the most powerful 
aspects of CSS is how you can use it to make global style changes across an entire Web 
site. Suppose, for example, that you create a style for your headlines by redefining the 
<h1> tag to create large, blue, bold headlines. Then one fine day, you decide that all 
your headlines should be red instead of blue. If you aren’t using CSS, changing all your 
headlines could be a huge undertaking — a matter of opening every Web page in your 
site to make changes to the font tags around your headlines. But, if you’re using CSS in 
an external style sheet, you can simply change the style that controls the headline in 
the style sheet, and voilà! Your headlines all turn red automatically. If you ever have to 
redesign your site (and believe me, every good site goes through periodic redesigns), 
you can save hours or even days of work if you created your design with CSS.
Appreciating the advantages of CSS
A Web site designed with CSS separates content from design. Keeping the site 
content (such as the text and headings) separate from the instructions that tell a 
browser how the page should look benefits both the designers and your site visitors:
	
✓	CSS simplifies design changes. For example, instead of formatting every head­
line in your site as 24-point Arial bold, you can create a style for the <h1> tag 
that contains all the formatting information in one place and then apply that 

55
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
style to the text in an XHTML file. CSS styles can be saved in the header sec­
tion at the very top of an XHTML page, or they can be saved in a separate file 
that can be attached to multiple XHTML pages. One of the advantages of styles 
is that if you can use the same style to format many headlines and then you 
decide later that you want all your headlines to use the Garamond font instead 
of Arial, all you need to do is change the style for the <h1> tag once, and it 
automatically applies everywhere you’ve used the <h1> tag to format your 
headlines.
	
✓	Separating content from design enables you to create different style sheets 
for different audiences and devices. In the future, separating content from 
design is likely to become even more important as a growing number of people 
view Web pages on everything from giant, flat-screen monitors to tiny, cell­
phone screens. One of the coolest features in Adobe Dreamweaver is Device 
Central, where you can preview your page designs in a variety of handheld 
devices and cellphones to see just how different they can look when displayed 
on these small screens.
	
	As you get more advanced with CSS, you can even create multiple style sheets 
for the same Web page. For example, you can create one that’s ideally suited 
to a small screen like the one shown in Figure 4-6, another one that works best 
when the page is printed, and yet another designed with a larger font size for 
anyone who may have trouble reading the small print that is so common on 
Web pages.
	
✓	Using CSS makes your site comply with the current standards. Today, the 
W3C, which sets standards for the Internet, recommends using CSS for nearly 
every aspect of Web design because the best CSS designs are accessible, flex­
ible, and adaptable.
Figure 4-6: Designing Web pages with CSS can help you create designs 
that display well on large or small screens.

56
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
	
✓	Web sites designed in CSS are accessible to more visitors. Today, there’s 
a growing movement among some of the best designers in the world to get 
everyone to follow the same standards, create Web sites with CSS, and make 
sure they’re accessible to everyone.
	
	When Web designers talk about accessibility, they mean creating a site that can 
be accessed by anyone who might ever visit your pages — and that includes 
people with limited vision who use special browsers (often called screen read­
ers) that read Web pages aloud, as well as many others who use specialized 
browsers for a variety of other reasons.
	
	If you work for a university, a nonprofit, a government agency, or a similar 
organization, you may be required to create accessible designs. In Chapter 6, 
you find instructions for you alternative text with images and other features 
that can improve Web site accessibility. Even if you’re not required to design 
for accessibility, it’s still good practice because pages that meet accessibil­
ity standards also tend to score better in search engines because they’re 
designed in a way that makes it easy for search engines to access and interpret 
their content.
Combining CSS and XHTML
Most professional Web designers today recommend creating Web page designs by 
combining XHTML and CSS. How the two work together can get a bit complicated, 
but you essentially:
	
1.	 Use XHTML to create the structure of a page with tags, such as division (div), 
heading (h1, h2), and paragraph (p).
	
2.	 Create styles in CSS that specify the size of these elements, where they appear 
on a page, and a variety of other formatting options.
Similarly, you use XHTML to insert images and create links, and then add styles 
to change formatting options, such as removing the underline from your links or 
changing the color that appears when someone rolls a cursor over a link.
Following standards
Following standards has become increas­
ingly important as Web design has become 
more complex over the years.
Web technology has evolved to include new 
features, such as CSS, that provide greater 
design control than ever. Unfortunately, 
Web browsers (such as Internet Explorer and 
Firefox) don’t always display the features of 
Web sites in the same way. As a result, the 
same Web page can look quite different from 
one browser to another, especially in older 
browsers. (Find more about browser differ­
ences and testing your designs in Chapter 
10.) Enter standards, which help minimize 
the browser differences and enable Web 
pages to do their job of connecting people 
across the Internet. Today, it’s easy to agree 
that if everyone who designed Web sites 
and everyone who created the browsers that 
displayed them followed the same rules, or 
standards, we’d all have a much easier time 
designing sites for the Internet.

 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
	
All the templates featured in this book are written in XHTML and formatted with CSS 
following modern Web standards. In Chapters 7– 9, you can find specific instructions 
for using Adobe Dreamweaver to edit the templates and customize them. I did every­
thing I can to make these templates as versatile — and easy to use — as possible , 
but the more you understand about CSS and XHTML, the better you can customize 
the templates without changing them in a way that violates current standards or 
that will cause them to not display well in most Web browsers.
Creating page layouts with CSS and XHTML
The key to understanding how CSS works in page layout is to think in terms of 
designing with a series of infinitely adjustable containers, or boxes. Indeed, this 
approach to Web design is commonly referred to as the box model. Think of the 
box model this way: First you use HTML tags, such as the <div> (division) tag or 
<p> (paragraph) tag, to create a box around your content. Then you use CSS to 
style each box, using attributes to control the position and alignment of each box, 
and specify such settings as margins, padding, and borders.
Although you can use any XHTML tag as part of your page layout, the <div> tag is 
used most often to create the boxes for main sections of a page, such as the banner 
area, main content area, sidebars, and footer of a page. Think of <div> as a generic 
container — designed to hold text, images, or other content — or to make a divi­
sion on the page, to separate one section of content from another. Unlike other 
HTML tags, <div> has no inherent formatting features. Unless CSS is applied to 
a <div> tag, it can seem invisible on a page, yet the tag has a powerful purpose 
because any content surrounded by opening and closing <div> tags becomes an 
object (or a box) that can be formatted with CSS.
I used the box model to create all the templates in this book. As a result, to change 
the size or positioning of a section of a Web page in one of the templates featured in 
Chapters 7–9, you need to edit the corresponding style. When you create or edit a 
style that corresponds to a <div> tag ID, you can specify properties such as align­
ment, border, margin, height, and width to control how the <div> tag is displayed 
on the page. In the template chapters, you find step-by-step instructions for adding 
your own images and text to these templates, and for making minor changes to the 
styles of the page. To edit the styles that control the positioning, width, and other 
display options of the <div> tags that make up these pages layouts, read Chapter 
6, where you find instructions for editing a CSS layout.
Each <div> in the page templates has an ID, which corresponds to a style in the 
style sheet. The ID appears in the HTML within the <div> tag brackets so that the 
browser knows which style to use to control the formatting of that <div> when 
it displays the page. For example, all the templates have a <div> with the ID 
container that controls the overall size of the design area. If you look at the 
code, the <div> looks like this:
<div id=”container”></div>
In the corresponding style sheet, which you can easily access through the CSS 
Panel in Dreamweaver, you’ll find a style called #container, which controls the 
width and other settings for that <div>. If this all seems a bit confusing, don’t 

58
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
worry too much at this stage. When you put all this theory into practice with the 
templates in Chapters 7–9, it makes a lot more sense, and you find more detailed 
instructions for editing CSS layouts in Chapter 6.
To learn more about CSS, you can find many more lessons on how to create, define, 
and edit styles in my book Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies (Wiley).
Understanding style selectors
One of the first things you need to understand when you create new styles is 
which selector to use for which job. The selector determines the kind of style you 
will create. Each selector option has different naming restrictions and purposes. 
If you’re completely new to working with styles, this may not make much sense 
yet, but this is a fundamental part of work with styles, and I encourage you to read 
through all these descriptions of selectors so that you can appreciate your options 
before you move on.
	
Don’t feel you have to memorize all this. Instead, consider folding down the corner 
on this page so you can refer to this list of selectors when you create and edit styles 
later.
Class selectors
The class selector is the most versatile selector option. Class styles can be used to 
format any element (from text to images to multimedia), and they can be used as 
many times as you like on any page in a Web site.
Class style names always begin with a period, and you can create class styles with 
any name as long as you don’t use spaces or special characters. Note: Hyphens 
and dashes are okay. Thus, you could create a style called caption for the text that 
appears before your pictures.
.caption
Dreamweaver helps you with the opening period (or a dot). If you choose class 
as the selector type and forget to include a dot at the beginning of the name, 
Dreamweaver adds one for you. Note: Don’t include any space between the dot and 
the style name, though.
One other thing that can make styles confusing is that when you apply a class style 
to text or another element, the dot doesn’t appear in the name when it’s added to 
your HTML code. Thus, if you applied the .caption style to a paragraph tag to 
format the text under an image, it would look like this:
<p class=”caption”>This is a photo of an Egret in flight.</p>
	
Class styles must be applied to an element, such as the paragraph tag shown in this 
example. Class tags can even be added to elements that are already defined by other 
styles.
When you create a class style in Dreamweaver, the style is displayed in the CSS 
Styles panel on the right side of the workspace (shown in Figure 4-7). You can apply 
class styles by using the CSS drop-down list, also shown in Figure 4-7.

59
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
Figure 4-7: Styles created with class selectors are available from the CSS drop-down list 
and can be applied to any element and used as many times as you like on any page.
One more thing about styles for now: It’s common to create styles to align images 
and other elements to the right or left of a page, and styles with the names 
.float-right and .float-left are included in all the templates included with 
this book. These styles commonly include margin spacing to create a little white 
space between an image and text when text is wrapped around the aligned image, 
as shown in Figure 4-7.
For more details and step-by-step instructions for creating and applying styles with 
class selectors, see Chapter 6.
ID selectors
Think of ID styles as the building blocks of most CSS layouts. What’s special about 
ID styles is that they should be used only once per page. This makes them ideally 
suited to formatting <div> tags and other block-level elements that are used to 
create distinct sections in a design and only appear once per page.
ID styles must begin with a pound (#) character. Similar to class styles, 
Dreamweaver adds # to the beginning of the style name automatically if you forget 
to include it. And, like with a class style, don’t include a space between # and the 
style name.
The ID selector option is a new addition to the CSS Rule dialog box in Dreamweaver 
CS4. (In CS3, you had to choose the Advanced option to create an ID style.) Similar 
to class styles, you can name ID styles anything you like as long as you don’t use 
spaces or special characters (again hyphens and underscores are okay). An ID style 
used to identify the sidebar section of a page could look like this:
#sidebar
Similar to class styles, # isn’t used in the HTML code when a style is applied to an 
element, such as a <div> tag like this:
<div id=”sidebar”>Between these tags with the sidebar ID style, 
you would include any headlines, text, or other 
elements in your sidebar.</div>
In the predesigned CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver, all the designs are 
created by combining a series of <div> tags with ID styles using names like 
#container, #header, and #footer to identify the main sections of the design. 
In Figure 4-8, you can see how a collection of ID and class styles are displayed in the 
CSS Styles panel after they’re created.

Styles panel

Figure 4-8: Styles created with the ID selector should be used only once 
per page and are ideal for creating a CSS layout.
Tag selectors
The tag selector is used to redefine existing XHTML tags. Select this option if you 
want to change the appearance of an existing XHTML tag, such as the <h1> (head­
ing 1) tag or the <ul> (unordered list) tag.
In many cases, redefining existing XHTML tags with CSS has advantages over creat­
ing new styles. For example, content formatted with the heading 1 tag is well rec­
ognized on the Web as the most important text on a page. For that reason, many 
search engines give priority to text formatted with the heading 1 tag. Similarly, the 
hierarchical structure of the <h1>–<h6> tags helps ensure that, even if a visitor to 
your site changes the text size in his Web browser, text formatted with the heading 
1 tag is still larger relative to text formatted with an heading 2 tag, which is larger 
than text formatted with the heading 3 tag, and so on.
The ability to change the appearance of headings and other tags with CSS makes it 
possible to retain these advantages while still being able to use the font, size, color, 
spacing, and other formatting options that you prefer in your Web design. When 
you use the tag selector, the style definition is applied automatically to any text or 
other element that’s been formatted with the corresponding tag. Thus, if you’ve for­
matted a headline with an <h1> tag and then create a new <h1> style, the format­
ting you used to define the style will apply automatically to the headline as soon as 
the style is created.
When you choose a tag selector type, all the XHTML tags become visible in a drop-
down list in the New CSS Rule dialog, making it easy to choose the tag style you 
want to create, such as the H1 tag shown in Figure 4-9.

61
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
Property Inspector
Figure 4-9: You can redefine the appearance of any XHTML tag 
by creating a style with a tag selector.
Creating compound styles
The compound selector can be used to combine two or more style rules to create 
a style definition that displays only when one style is contained within another. 
Compound styles are useful when you want to do something like use the heading 
1 tag multiple times to format headlines in different ways on the same Web page. 
For example, you could create one style for headlines that appear in the main story 
area of a page and then create another style for headlines that appear in the side­
bar on the page and still use the heading 1 tag to format both.
Compound styles are created by combining ID, class, or tag styles and look like this:
#sidebar1 h1
See Figure 4-10 for an example of how an <h1> style defined like this within a 
#sidebar1 ID style looks in the New CSS Rule dialog box. Note that you must 

62
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
include a space between each name or tag in a compound style and that you don’t 
include the brackets around tag in a style name. In this example, the style definition 
will apply only to <h1> tags that appear within another element, such as a <div> 
tag with an ID style #sidebar1.
Figure 4-10: Use the compound style selector to combine styles.
If a compound style combines more than one tag, it’s written like this:
#sidebar1 h1 a:link 
Again, you must include a space between each name or tag. In this example, you 
see a style that defines the appearance of the active link tag only when the link is 
located inside an element formatted with the <h1> tag that’s also inside an element 
formatted with the #sidebar1 ID. A compound style like this makes it possible to 
create links that look different when they appear in a headline in the sidebar of a 
page than when they appear in another part of the sidebar.
After you figure out the differences among these style selector options and when 
they’re best used, you’re well on your way to mastering the art of creating Web 
pages with CSS in Dreamweaver. (Find more information about compound styles 
in Chapter 6.)
Understanding rule definition options
In CSS, you have the option of creating internal, external, or inline styles. You can 
even use a combination of these options, or attach multiple external style sheets, to 
the same Web page. Here’s an explanation of these options:
	
✓	Internal styles: If you create internal styles, the CSS code is stored in the <head> 
area at the top of the HTML page you’re working on, and the styles can be applied 
only to the page in which they were created. If you’re just creating a one-page Web 
site or you’re creating styles that will be used only on one page, an internal style 
sheet is fine, but for most sites, external style sheets offer many advantages.

63
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
	
✓	External styles: If you save your styles in an external style sheet, they’re 
stored in a separate file with a .css extension. External style sheets can be 
attached to any or all the pages in a Web site in much the same way that you 
can insert the same image into multiple pages. You can also attach multiple 
external style sheets to the same page. For example, you can create one style 
sheet for styles that format text and another for layout styles. You can also 
create external style sheets for different purposes, such as one for print and 
one for screen display. One of the biggest advantages of external style sheets 
is that they make it faster and easier to create new pages, and they make it 
possible to update styles across many pages at once.
	
✓	Inline styles: Inline styles are created within a document at the place that a style 
is used and only apply to the element they’re attached to in the document. These 
are generally considered the least useful of the three style sheet options because 
any changes to the defined style must be made to the code that contains the ele­
ment, which means you lose many of the benefits of styles, such as the ability to 
make global updates and create very clean, fast-loading code. For example, creat­
ing one style for all your headlines and saving it in an external style sheet is more 
efficient than applying the style formatting options to each headline separately.
At the bottom of the New CSS Rule dialog box, shown in Figure 4-11, you find a Rule 
Definition drop-down list. Use this list to specify where and how you want to save 
each new style that you define. The options are
	
✓	This Document Only: Create an internal style that can only be used in the 
open document.
	
✓	New Style Sheet file: Create the new style in an external style sheet and create 
a new external style sheet simultaneously. 
	
✓	An existing external style sheet: Choose any existing external style sheet 
attached to the page by selecting the name of the style sheet from the Rule 
Definition drop-down list. In Figure 4-11, I am selecting an existing style sheet 
with the name main.css.
	
If you’re creating a style that you’ll likely want to use on more than one page in your 
site, saving the style to a new or existing external style sheet is your best choice. If 
you save a style in an internal style sheet and later decide you want to add it to an 
external style sheet, you can move the style by clicking and dragging the style into 
the external style sheet list in the CSS Styles panel.
Figure 4-11: When defining a new CSS rule, save it in an internal or external style sheet.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Why so many fonts?
Although you can specify any font you 
want for text on your Web pages, you don’t 
have complete control over how that font 
appears on your visitor’s computer because 
the font you apply is displayed properly 
only if your visitors have the same font on 
their hard drives. To help ensure that your 
text appears as you intend, Dreamweaver 
includes collections of the most common 
fonts on Windows and Macintosh comput­
ers, grouped together in families, such as 
Arial, Helvetica, sans serif, and Georgia, 
Times New Roman, Times, and serif.
Here’s how it works. When you apply a 
collection of fonts like these, the browser 
displays the formatted text in the first font 
available in the list. For example, if you 
choose the font collection that starts with 
Georgia and your visitors have Georgia 
on their hard drives, they’ll see your text 
in Georgia. If they don’t have Georgia, the 
text is displayed in the next font on the list 
that your visitors do have — in this case, 
Times New Roman. If they don’t have that 
font either, the text is displayed in Times; 
and if they don’t even have Times (which 
would be very unusual), the browser looks 
for any serif font. (In case you’re not familiar 
with font terms, serif describes fonts, such 
as Times, that have those little curly things 
on the edges of letters; sans serif means no 
curly things, which is what you get with a 
font like Arial.)
You can create your own font collections by 
selecting the Edit Font List option from the 
bottom of the Font-Family drop-down list in 
the Property inspector or the Type category 
of the CSS Rule definition dialog box. In the 
Edit Font List dialog box, shown here, use 
the plus and minus buttons at the top of the 
Edit Font List dialog box to add or remove 
a font collection. To add individual fonts to 
a collection, select the font name from the 
bottom right of the dialog box and use the 
double-left arrows to add it to a font list. 
(Use the double-right arrows to remove a 
font from a collection.)
The only way to ensure that text appears in 
the font you want is to create the text in a 
graphic in a program, such as Photoshop or 
Fireworks, and then insert the graphic with 
the text into your page. That’s not a bad 
option for special text, such as banners or 
logos; but it’s usually not a good option for 
all your text because graphics take longer 
to download than text and are harder to 
update later.

65
 Chapter 4: Understanding Web Design
Looking at the code behind the scenes
Even if you prefer not to look at the code behind your Web pages, it’s helpful to at 
least have some familiarity with different kinds of tags, CSS, and other code that 
Dreamweaver creates for you when you design Web pages. The following examples 
show what the CSS code in an internal or external style sheet would look like in 
Dreamweaver for the following styles:
	
✓	An ID style created with the ID selector, that is named #container, and is 
defined as 780 pixels wide with the left and right margins set to auto (a cool 
trick for centering a CSS design, covered in Chapter 6).
	
✓	A style created with a class selector, that is named .caption, and is defined 
as Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans serif, small, italic, and bold.
	
✓	A style created with a tag selector to redefine the HTML tag <h1> — as Arial, 
Helvetica, sans serif, large, and bold. (Note: Because the heading tags already 
include bold formatting, it’s not necessary to include bold in the style definition.)
#container {
	
width: 780px;
	
margin-right: auto;
	
margin-left: auto;
}
.caption {
	
font-family:  Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	
font-size: small;

font-weight: bold;
}

Editing and Creating 
Web Graphics
I
n this chapter, you discover some of the extraordinary things 
you can do with a program like Photoshop Elements. You find 
out how to create images (like banners and buttons) for Web 
pages and then resize, crop, and edit those images.
Perhaps most important in this book about creating Web sites, 
you find step-by-step instructions for creating and optimizing 
graphics that download quickly over the Web.
You can use a number of competing image-editing programs to 
complete the tasks in this book. I recommend Adobe Photoshop 
Elements because it’s based on the industry standard in image 
editing, Adobe Photoshop, but is a lot easier to use and a lot less 
expensive. In this book, I use Elements 8, but if you use any of 
the last few versions of Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, you 
  should have no trouble following along with the features covered 
  in the step-by-step tasks. 
Introducing Photoshop Elements
Although Photoshop Elements is a stripped-down version of its big-sister program, 
Adobe Photoshop, it’s still a powerful tool. The workspace, shown in Figure 5-1, is 
clean and simple yet features many tools and panels — and it has loads of options 
for editing images and saving them for the Web. Adobe designed the interface of 
this program to keep the tools around the edge of the screen and to give you the 
largest possible workspace in the middle, although you can open and close panels 
and move them around the screen to suit your preferences.
When you first launch Photoshop Elements, you’re greeted by a Welcome screen 
featuring six choices. To access the program’s main editing features, which are 
covered in the following sections, choose Edit and Enhance Photos.
Tasks Performed 
in This Chapter
✓	Getting to know

Photo by Jasper Johal
Figure 5-1: Photoshop Elements displays a wide range of tools and panels around the
perimeter of the main workspace, where you can create and edit images. 
To help you become familiar with the program before you start on the tasks, the 
following sections introduce you to the way the workspace in Elements is organized 
and its main features: the Toolbox, Options bar, menu, and panels.
The Toolbox
One of the first things you have to get used to when you use graphics programs 
like Photoshop Elements is that before you can do anything, like crop an image, 
you have to select the correct tool from the Toolbox. This feature works much like 
the toolbox you may have in your garage: You choose a hammer when you want to 
pound a nail, or a screwdriver when you want to turn a screw.
Selecting a tool from the Toolbox is easy: Just click the icon that represents the 
tool you want, such as the T icon (for adding text to an image). The tricky part is 
knowing which tool to use for the job (which is similar to understanding the dif­
ference between flat-head and Phillips-head screwdrivers). Some tools are easy to 
identify: The Brush tool is for painting, for example. Other tools, such as the Clone 
Stamp tool, may seem confusing at first.
The list of tools shown in Figure 5-2 is designed to help you appreciate all your 
options in the Toolbox.
	
The Toolbox can appear in one long list down the side of the Workspace (refer to 
Figure 5-1), or you can drag it anywhere on the screen and adjust it to appear in two 
columns (see Figure 5-2).

Here’s a hint: Some tools are hidden underneath other tools. If a Toolbox button 
has a small triangle in its lower-right corner, it means that multiple tools are acces­
sible from the same button. To view these alternative tools, simply click and hold 
the visible tool until a small fly-out menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: The fly-out menus reveal more options under some of the Toolbox items.
Although you use many of these tools in the step-by-step tasks in this book to create 
and edit images for the Web, I can’t possibly cover all the ways you can use these 
great features in this introduction to Web graphics. In this book, I focus on the tools 
and features that are most important in Web design. If you want to find out more 
about creating and editing images, check out Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies, by 
Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova, or (for more advanced techniques) Photoshop 
Bible, by Laurie Ulrich Fuller and Robert C. Fuller (both from Wiley Publishing).
The Options bar
Running across the top of the Elements workspace is the Options bar, shown in 
Figure 5-4. The Options bar includes drop-down lists, check boxes, and radio buttons 
that you can use to adjust the settings for any selected tool. For example, when you 
select the Brush tool, options are available for changing the size and shape of the 
stroke that you make when you click and drag the Brush tool over an image. If you 
switch to the Text tool, the Options bar changes to feature font and size options.
The art of Undo and Redo
With all the features, filters, and editing 
options in Photoshop Elements, trial and 
error is often your best strategy — and it’s 
easy when you can use Undo, Redo, and 
even Revert to restore any image to its last-
saved version.
If you make a change to an image and then 
change your mind, just choose Edit➪Undo 
to undo it. If you aren’t quite sure whether 
you made an improvement, try Undo and 
then Redo (Edit➪Redo) so that you can 
compare the image before and after the 
effect. Photoshop Elements includes many 
levels of Undo, so you can go back many 
steps and experiment until an image is just 
the way you want it.
If you’re a keyboard shortcut fan, press 
Ctrl+Z to use Undo in Windows (or Ô+Z on 
the Mac); for Redo, press Ctrl+Y (or Ô+Y).

73
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Figure 5-4: The Options bar provides easy access to settings for each tool, 
such as the font and size options that correspond to the Text tool.
The menu bar
No program is complete without a menu bar at the top of the workspace (shown 
in Figure 5-5). When you click the menu names, you can choose from a list of com­
mands and editing options. If an ellipsis (. . .) follows the command name, the 
option launches a dialog box where you can apply a variety of features. Otherwise, 
the command kicks in automatically as soon as it’s selected.
Figure 5-5: The menu bar provides access to most of the features in Photoshop Elements, including 
my personal favorite, the Undo option, which can get you out of all kinds of problems.
The panels
As in every Adobe application, the Elements workspace is filled with panels, which 
are small windows that hold formatting options and other settings. The various 

74
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
panels provide tools to help you edit and examine images. To open a panel, choose 
it from the Window menu. For example, choosing Window➪Color Swatches opens 
a panel with color options. Note that each panel has a More button; clicking More 
displays a list of additional commands.
A panel can remain in its column on the right side of the workspace, or you can 
drag panels anywhere on the screen, which is a handy way to get them closer to 
where you’re working. To move a panel, click it and then drag it by its tab, and 
then release it where you like. After you detach a panel from the main application 
window, it gains its own title bar, which allows for easier moving and identification. 
In Figure 5-6, I’m using the Layer Styles in the Special Effects panel to add a drop shadow 
to my text, a common way to add depth and make text appear to float on a page.
Figure 5-6: You can move a panel so that it’s closer to whatever you’re working on.
	
If you ever want to get back to the original workspace layout in Photoshop Elements, 
just choose Window➪Reset Panels, and all the panels and bins magically rearrange 
themselves to their original positions.
Creating and opening images in Elements
You can open existing images in Photoshop 
Elements or create completely new images, 
and you can have multiple images open at 
a time, which makes it easier to combine 
images and create complex designs. When 
you create a new image, you can specify 
many settings, including size, resolution, 
and color.
To create a new document, choose File➪New, 
and in the New File dialog box that appears, 
specify the height, width, resolution, color 
mode, and background color. You can alter 
any of the settings after you create an image.
To open an existing image, choose File➪
Open, find the image you want on your 
hard drive, click to select it, and then click 
Open. The image appears in a new window, 
ready for you to edit.
If you try to open an image and don’t see 
it in a folder on your hard drive when you 
know that it should be there, change the 
Files of Type field (at the bottom of the Open 
dialog box) to All Formats. Every image in 
the folder should now appear in the file list.

 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Because photos on the Web are generally small, one way to ensure that 
important features are visible is to crop out any material that’s not 
essential. The best strategy when cropping an image for the Web is to 
focus on the key elements in the image. You can cut off the top, bottom, 
or sides, as much or as little as you like, with the adjustable edges of 
the Crop tool.
In this step-by-step task, you see how using the Crop tool to remove the 
background helps focus attention on the subject.
Whenever you crop, edit, or resize an image, it’s good practice to first 
save a copy of the image to edit. That way you can always go back to 
the original image if you’re not happy with the results of your edits.
	1.	 With an image open in Elements, select the Crop tool 
from the Tools panel. Because you can’t retrieve cropped 
parts of an image after you save and close the image file, 
you likely want to work with a copy of your original 
image.
	2.	 Click and drag within the image to 
define the area you want to crop. 
As you drag, a crop box appears. 
Everything outside the crop box is 
removed when you complete the 
crop. To increase or decrease the size 
of the crop box, drag the handles at 
the corners or edges of the box.

Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to make an additional crop. Choose Edit➪Undo Crop to restore the image if you’re 
unhappy with the crop. When you save the image, your changes become permanent.
	4.	 When you complete the crop, the 
areas of the image outside the crop 
box are removed, and the overall 
size of the image is reduced propor­
tionately. The Crop tool remains 
active until you select a different 
tool from the Toolbox.
	3.	 To complete the crop, double-click in the middle of the 
selected area or click the Commit icon (the green check 
mark) in the lower-right corner of the crop box. To cancel 
the Crop tool without cropping the image, click the 
Cancel button (the red circle with a line through it).

 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
Resizing is important for two reasons: The images must be small 
enough to display well on a computer monitor, and you want them to 
download quickly to a user’s computer. The smaller the image is, the 
faster it will download. There are two steps to reducing the size of an 
image you want to use on the Web.
The first step is to reduce the physical size of an image by reducing its 
dimensions. You want to size your images to fit well in a browser window 
and to work within the design of your site. And remember, the smaller 
you make the image, the faster it downloads to a user’s computer.
The second step is a bit more complex to understand at first. It has to do 
with reducing the resolution of an image, which changes the number of 
pixels in the image, but won’t alter the size the image appears on a com­
puter screen. When you’re working with images for the Web, you want to 
reduce the resolution to 72 pixels per inch (or ppi). (If you’re wondering 
why 72, see the sidebar that’s appropriately named “Why only 72 ppi?”)
Follow these steps to reduce the size of an image and lower the resolution:
	1.	 With an image open in Elements, choose 
Image➪Resize. If you don’t want your 
original image to lose quality, make a 
copy of it by choosing File➪Save As and 
giving the copy a new name. Then resize 
the copy for your Web site.

	2.	 Before you change the resolution of an image, make 
sure to deselect the Resample Image check box at the 
bottom of the Image Size dialog box (you should always 
make sure the resample check box is deselected when 
you change resolution). Then highlight the number in 
the Resolution field and replace it by typing in the 
number 72. (Note that with the Resample Image check 
box deselected, you can’t change the Pixel dimensions.)

78
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	3.	 Before you change the dimensions of an image, 
make sure to select the Resample Image check 
box (you always want the Resample box selected 
when you resize), and also select the Scale Styles 
and Constrain Proportions check boxes to main­
tain the height and width ratio in the image. In 
this example, I am changing the width of this 
image to 500 pixels, and the height automatically 
adjusts to 269 pixels to maintain the proportions. 
When you’re resizing an image for the Web, it’s 
best to use the fields in the Pixel Dimensions 
area, at the top of the dialog box. Using these 
options, you can alter the height and width of an 
image to a specified size in pixels or enlarge or 
reduce the image by any percentage.
	4.	 Click OK to resize the image. If you 
want to return the image to its 
previous size, choose Edit➪Undo. 
When you save the image, the 
changes become permanent. Notice 
that the file size is reduced from 
1.33MB to 393.8K.
Why only 72 ppi?
When you save images for the Web, you 
should save them at a resolution of 72 
pixels per inch (better known as ppi). Most 
computer monitors display no more than 
72 ppi, so any number higher than that is 
wasted on the Web because you’re making 
your visitors download more pixels than 
they can see. However, if you want to print 
an image, you want all the pixels you can 
get, usually at least 200 ppi or higher, which 
is why most images you see on the Web 
look terrible if you try to print them in a 
large size.

The JPEG format is the best choice for images with many colors, such 
as photographs or images that include shading or gradients. You can 
save any image in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format by using the Save for Web 
dialog box, but you produce the best results if you choose the best 
format for each image. That’s because the best way to optimize images 
(make them download faster over the Web) depends on how many 
colors appear in the image.
It’s always best to edit an image in the highest resolution possible and 
then resize the image and reduce the resolution (as you do in the previ­
ous task) just before optimizing it for the Web.
Also note that even if a photograph is already in the JPEG format, you 
can almost always reduce its file size (and increase its download speed) 
by using the Save for Web dialog box to optimize the image, as you see 
in the following steps:
	1.	 Create a new image or open an 
existing image in any format in 
Photoshop Elements. Because you 
create a copy of the image when 
you use the Save for Web dialog 
box, you don’t need to worry about 
altering your original image.

When you’re optimizing an image for the Web, it always comes down to balancing quality with file size. You 
want your images to download fast, but not if that means they don’t look good when they arrive.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 Choose File➪Save for Web, and in 
the Save for Web dialog box, select 
JPEG from the Optimized File 
Format drop-down list. Note: The 
original version of the image 
appears on the left side of the 
dialog box, and the version on the 
right is a preview of how the image 
will look with the specified settings.
	3.	 If the image, like the one shown in this example, is larger 
than the preview area in the Save for Web dialog box, 
choose the Hand tool from the upper-left corner of the 
dialog box. Then click the image and drag to position the 
most important elements in the image where you can 
see a better preview. You can also change the image’s 
display by right-clicking directly over the preview image 
and choosing Fit on Screen or any of the magnification 
settings.
	4.	 To reduce the size of a JPEG image, use the slider to 
alter the Quality setting or enter a number, up to 100. 
Compression is measured as a percentage: The lower 
the number, the higher the compression and the 
smaller the file size.
	5.	 Notice in the bottom of the Save for Web dialog box that the original file size appears 
under the preview of the image on the left, and the optimized file size appears under 
the preview on the right. In this example, you can see that when the Quality field is 
set to 80, the image is reduced from 612K to 34.74K.

81
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
	6.	 Alter the Quality setting until the image uses the 
greatest amount of compression (the greater the 
compression, the lower the number in the Quality 
field), without degrading the appearance of the 
image too much. In this example, I reduced the 
Quality setting to 60, creating a file size of 28.28K.
	7.	 Keep a close eye on the preview 
screen as you adjust the Quality 
option. If you reduce the quality too 
far, you degrade the image’s appear­
ance noticeably.
	8.	 In this example, I decided I wanted to preserve as much quality as possible (reducing it to 60 made it 
look a little pixilated), so I’ve changed it to 80. After all the image settings are the way you want 
them, click OK, and in the Save dialog box, give the image a new name and specify where you want to 
save it on your hard drive. Then click Save to save a new version of the JPEG with the specified set­
tings and preserve the original unchanged.

The GIF format has long been considered best for drawings, cartoons, and 
other images that have only a few bands of solid color, although many Web 
designers now prefer the PNG format. (As described in the previous sec­
tion, the JPEG format is ideal for photographs and other images with mil­
lions of colors.) GIFs and PNGs are also the best format to use when you 
want to create images that use a transparent background, a trick that 
makes images appear to float on a Web page. As the Web has matured, the 
PNG format has gained popularity. PNGs are superior to GIFs in all ways 
except one: GIFs are better supported by Web browsers older than Internet 
Explorer 6.0, especially in the area of transparency.
If your goal is to ensure that your pages display well to anyone who may ever 
visit your site, GIF is the safer option. If you want your images to look their 
best with the smallest file sizes, you produce better results with the PNG 
format. Also, you can rest assured that very few people are still using brows­
ers so old that they don’t support PNG. In the step-by-step exercise that fol­
lows, I chose the PNG format, but the process is the same for both options. 
This task shows you the best way to reduce the number of colors in any 
image when you save it in either the PNG or GIF format using Photoshop 
Elements.
	1.	 Create a new image or open an 
existing image in any format in 
Photoshop Elements. Because you 
save a copy of an image when you 
use the Save for Web option, you 
don’t have to worry about altering 
your original image (just don’t save 
over the original).

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Optimizing Graphics in GIF or PNG Format
Time needed:
Less than half 
an hour
	
When you use the PNG or GIF formats, you can reduce download time by decreasing the total number of colors 
used in the image, which makes it ideal for graphics that need only a few colors in order to display well, such as 
cartoons or simple logo designs. When you reduce the number of colors in a PNG or GIF image, you’re essen­
tially removing colors you don’t need. If you take away too many colors, however, the change can be drastic 
(and look terrible); but if you limit the image to only the number of colors that are necessary, you might not 
even notice the difference, and the image will download much faster.

83
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
	2.	 Choose File➪Save for Web. In the 
Save for Web dialog box, choose 
PNG-8 from the Optimized File 
Format drop-down list. (PNG-24 
supports color and alpha transpar­
ency better, but with a much higher 
file size, so you’re almost always 
better off with PNG-8.)
	3.	 If you’re creating an image with a transparent back­
ground, select the Transparency check box and then 
specify a matte color. The matte color should match the 
background color of the Web page where the image will 
be displayed. Using a matching matte color helps prevent 
“jaggies” from appearing around the edges of the image. 
To change this color, first select the eyedropper from the 
upper-left corner of the dialog box. Then click in the 
Matte field to open the color panel where you can select 
the Eyedropper Color option to apply the color you just 
sampled with the Eyedropper tool. You can also select 
any of the other color options in the drop-down list.
	4.	 To reduce the size of the image, lower the number of 
colors by entering a number less than 256 in the Colors 
field or by selecting a preset number from the Colors 
drop-down list. In this example, the image is reduced 
from 256 (the maximum number of colors a GIF can 
have) to 32. You can change the numbers to see the 
results in the preview and then change them again 
if you’re not happy with the results, as I do in the 
next step).

84
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	6.	 Reduce the number of colors further to make the file size 
even smaller — but don’t go too far. In this example, you 
can see that when the image is reduced to only two 
colors, the text gets jagged and the detail is lost in the 
image of the eye. That’s because even though the image 
appears to use only a few colors, along the edge of the 
letters, many variations of the main colors are used to 
create a clean line between the text and the background. 
With only two colors in the image, those color variations 
are lost and the smooth edge becomes jagged.
	5.	 Notice at the bottom of the Save for Web dialog box that 
the original file size appears under the preview of the 
image on the top and the optimized file size appears 
under the preview on the bottom. Compare these num­
bers to see how much smaller the image is with the 
number of colors reduced from 256 to 64. In this example, 
you can see that by reducing the number of colors, the 
image has been reduced from 183K to 4.452K.
	7.	 Adjust the number of colors and 
other settings until the image uses 
the smallest number of colors (and 
therefore has the smallest file size) 
without degrading the appearance of 
the image. In this example, I was able 
to reduce the image to 64 colors 
without a noticeable loss of quality.
	8.	 After all the image settings are the 
way you want them, click OK. In the 
Save dialog box, name the image, 
and specify where you want to save 
it on your hard drive. Then click 
Save.
	
When you use the Save for Web dialog box, Elements automatically saves a copy of the image in the new 
format and leaves the original image unchanged.

	2.	 If the Layers panel isn’t already open on the side 
of the workspace, choose Window➪Layers to 
open the Layers panel. (It must be open if you 
want to keep track of the layers as they’re auto­
matically created when you copy in images or 
add text to the image.)
Creating a new image with photos and text is almost as easy as editing 
an existing image, such as the banners and buttons included in the tem­
plates in this book.
In general, I find that the best method is to create a new image in 
Photoshop Elements and then copy any photos or other graphics into 
the new image file. After the images are in place, you can easily add text 
to pull it all together. Just follow these steps to create your own ban­
ners and buttons:
	1.	 In Photoshop Elements, choose File➪New➪
Blank File to create a new image. In the New 
dialog box, specify the size, resolution, and 
background color. In this task, I’m creating an 
image that’s 760 pixels wide by 410 pixels high 
with a resolution of 72 ppi, in RGB color with a 
white background. (For the Web, the color 
mode is always RGB for JPEG images.)

	5.	 To copy an open image into the new file, first click to 
select the Move tool from the upper-left corner of the 
Toolbox. Then click anywhere on an open image to 
make it active and choose Select➪All.
	4.	 When you’re working with multiple 
images in Photoshop Elements, you 
may want to open the Project Bin, 
at the bottom of the workspace: If it 
isn’t already open, choose Window➪
Open the Project Bin. You can select 
any open image by double-clicking its 
thumbnail image in the Project Bin. 
	3.	 Open any image or images that you 
want to add to the new file by 
choosing File➪Open and selecting 
the image from your hard drive. 
You can open as many images as 
you want at once in Photoshop or 
Photoshop Elements (or as many as 
your computer’s memory can sup­
port) in any of the many supported 
formats, including JPEG, GIF, TIF, 
and PSD.

87
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
	6.	 With the image selected, choose File➪Copy or press 
the key combination Ctrl+C (on Windows) or Ô+C 
(on the Mac).
	7.	 Here’s the tricky part: You need to select the 
file where you want to add the image before 
you paste it. If the Project Bin is open at the 
bottom of the workspace, you can select the 
destination image there. You can also select 
any image that’s visible in the workspace by 
clicking it. In both Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements, you can also select any open image 
by choosing the name of the file from the 
bottom of the Window menu.
	8.	 If any of the open images are in your way, 
you can minimize them, keeping them open 
and available in the Project Bin, but out of 
the workspace.
	9.	 With your new, blank image active in the workspace, 
choose File➪Paste, or use the key combinations Ctrl+V 
(on Windows) or Ô+V (on the Mac), to paste the copied 
image into the new image.

88
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	10.	To position the pasted image, click 
to select it and then drag it to the 
place where you want it to appear 
in the new image. For more precise 
images, use the arrow keys — you 
can adjust a selected layer pixel-by-
pixel in any direction. You can 
resize an image with the Move tool 
by clicking and dragging any corner 
to adjust the height and width.
	11.	 To add and position additional 
images, repeat Steps 6 through 10. 
Notice in this example that the Layers 
palette displays three layers — the 
white background layer and a sepa­
rate layer for each photo pasted into 
the image. As I added those images, 
Photoshop Elements added the layers 
automatically.
	12.	To add text to an image (whether or not it 
already has multiple layers, like this one 
does), you must first select the Text tool 
from the Toolbox.

89
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
	13.	When you select the Text tool, a new collection of 
options appears at the top of the workspace. On the 
Options bar, you can change such text options as the 
color (shown in this figure), by clicking the color well 
to open the color selection palette and then clicking 
any color in the palette. Use the scroll bar, to the right 
of the palette window, to display more colors.
	14.	With the Text tool selected, you can also use 
the Text tool options at the top of the work­
space to change the font size, face, and 
alignment.
	15.	To add text to the image, click to place your cursor 
where you want it and then type. You can add as much 
text as you want to an image and press the Enter (or 
Return) key to add line breaks.
	16.	You can also use the text options at the top 
of the workspace to edit the text after you 
type it. To do so, simply select the text you 
want to change, and then choose any of the 
formatting options to alter the color, font, 
size, or other settings. To edit the words, 
click to select the text and then delete or 
type to replace it.

90
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	
As you create more and more layers in an image, it’s good practice to give your layers names as you create them 
so that you can better identify a layer when you want to edit it later.
	17.	When you add text, Photoshop automatically places it 
on a new layer, which appears in the Layers palette. To 
move or edit a layer, you must first select the Move 
tool from the Toolbox. Photoshop Elements automati­
cally selects a layer when you click it, and then you can 
click and drag to position it on the page. To move a 
layer so that it appears in front of another layer, click 
and drag it above the other layer in the Layers palette.
	18.	You can continue to add text layers 
and images, and edit and adjust 
them, forever by repeating this set 
of steps. One of the best ways to 
become comfortable with using 
Photoshop Elements is to take time 
to experiment with combining and 
rearranging text and images in mul­
tiple layers.
Turning layers on and off or rearranging them
Sometimes when you’re working on an 
image with many layers, it’s handy to turn 
them on and off so that you can experi­
ment with different combinations or clear 
the workspace while you work on a detail. 
By clicking the small eye icon to the left of 
any layer, you can make the layer invisible 
in the workspace. Don’t worry — you can 
turn the layer back on by simply clicking in 
the same field again to make the eye icon 
reappear. That’s the beauty of this feature: 
Now you see it, now you don’t.
You can also rearrange the order of layers in 
the Layers panel, which is how you can con­
trol which layer is on top in the image. To 
change the stacking order, click to drag the 
layer up or down in the Layers panel. The 
higher the layer is in the panel, the higher 
its position is in the stacking order in the file.

91
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
One of the most confusing features in a program like Photoshop 
Elements is the way it divides different parts of an image into layers. In 
the previous task, Photoshop automatically created a new layer each 
time you added a new image or text to the file. Keeping each element of 
an image on a separate layer is a bit like keeping a bunch of sticky notes 
on your desk. If each photo or piece of text is on a separate layer, you 
can move them around independently, much like you might rearrange 
your priorities by changing the order of the sticky notes.
Using Layers to separate one image into multiple sections makes it pos­
sible for you to do things like edit text without changing the photo 
underneath it or move separate images around a photo montage until 
you get them just the way you want them.
Without layers, text would become stuck on a photo in a banner, like 
the one shown in this task, and you couldn’t edit the text again after 
you added it to the image. The layers feature is especially useful for 
customizing the banners and other graphic elements included in the 
templates used in this book.
When you open an image that has many layers, such as the image tem­
plates included with this book, it’s a good idea to open up the Layers 
panel by choosing Window➪Layers (if it’s not open already).
Before you can edit any text or image contained in a layer, you have to 
first select the appropriate tool from the Toolbox and then select the 
corresponding layer. That’s where the Layers panel comes in, as you 
see in this task.
	1.	 Open an existing image in 
Photoshop Elements that includes 
multiple layers, such as the banner 
shown in this task.

	2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the

to select the layer you want to edit. In 
this example, I selected the layer that 
corresponds to the words Hollywood 
Bar Secrets.
	3.	 In the Toolbox, select the tool that you need 
in order to edit the contents of the layer. In 
this example, I selected the Text tool so that 
I can edit the words.
	4.	 Use the selected tool to alter the selected 
image. In this example, I double-clicked the 
name Hollywood to select it and then typed 
the name Los Angeles in its place.

93
 Chapter 5: Editing and Creating Web Graphics
	5.	 To edit text in another layer, you 
must again select the correspond­
ing layer in the Layers panel. In this 
example, I selected the layer that 
contains the text in the second line 
of the banner image. Because I had 
already selected the Text tool, after 
the layer was selected, I simply 
selected the text I wanted to edit 
and replaced it by typing new text.
	6.	 After you make changes to the text, 
choose File➪Save As and give the 
image a new name. This step saves 
the changes without altering the 
original image.
Enlarging and reducing image display
As you’re working on images in Photoshop 
Elements, it’s often helpful to enlarge or 
reduce the display size of the image so that 
you can view more of it on the screen or to 
zoom in on details you want to edit. You can 
use the Zoom tool to increase or decrease 
the size at which the image appears on your 
screen.
First, click to select the Zoom tool from the 
Toolbox; then click anywhere on the image 
to increase its display size. Alt+click (in 
Windows) or Option+click (on the Mac) to 
decrease the display size. 
Tip: By changing the display size, you can 
figure out how much you may need to 
change the actual size of your image to 
make it appear the way you want on a com­
puter screen. To do so, use the Zoom tool 
to size the image the way you want in your 
Web page, and then notice the percentage 
(displayed at the top of the screen, next to 
the filename). Then you know the number 
you need to enter in the Size field in the 
Image Size dialog box when you resize it 
using a percentage.
To redisplay the image in its true size on 
your monitor, double-click the Zoom tool.

T
he high-end features in Dreamweaver make it the preferred 
choice for professional Web designers, but its easy-to-use 
graphical interface makes it popular among novices and hobby­
ists as well. This book is designed to help you create a Web site as 
quickly as possible by providing you with templates for a variety 
of common Web sites and instructions for how to customize those 
templates in Dreamweaver. If you’re eager to get started, feel free 
to jump ahead to Chapters 7, 8, or 9, where you find instructions for 
using Dreamweaver to customize the ready-to-use templates that 
come with this book.
Before you do, though, I suggest that you at least skim through this 
chapter so that you have some familiarity with the most important 
features in Dreamweaver, how I’ve used Dreamweaver’s advanced 
template features to help you create sites quickly, and how you 
can edit those templates with this great Web design program. This 
chapter is designed to introduce you to Dreamweaver and to show 
you how to do some the most common tasks with this popular 
design program, such as creating new pages, inserting images, set­
ting links, and defining CSS styles.
	
At the beginning of this chapter, you find detailed instructions for one of the most 
important features in Dreamweaver: the Site Definition dialog box. Defining a site 
in Dreamweaver is important whether you use one of the templates featured later 
in this book or create your own, custom design using the instructions in the rest of 
this chapter. Before you work on any Web site in Dreamweaver, you should start 
with the site-definition process.
	
In my effort to keep things simple in this book, I cover only a small portion of the 
features in this complex program. You can read lots more about Dreamweaver in 
my book Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies (Wiley).
Setting Up a New or Existing Site
As a general rule, when you create a Web site, you first create all the pages on your

test the site before it’s visible on the Internet. Then, when the site is ready, you 
transfer the files to your Web server, a computer with a permanent connection to 
the Internet that uses special software to communicate with Web browsers, such as 
Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
Because all the files you work with on your hard drive must be in the same relative 
location on the Web server, you need to store all your site’s resources in one folder 
on your hard drive and identify that folder as the local root folder in Dreamweaver.
As you progress through the site-definition process in the following task, you can 
create a new folder on your hard drive and designate it as your local root folder, or 
you can identify an existing folder if you’re updating or redesigning a site. The loca­
tion where you save the local root folder on your hard drive doesn’t matter, as long 
as you identify it as the main folder for your Web site in Dreamweaver. Note: If you 
move the local root folder, you have to go through the site setup process again so 
that Dreamweaver knows where to find it.
When you’re ready to publish a completed site, you can transfer it to your Web 
server by using the Dreamweaver built-in File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) features. 
You find detailed instructions for testing and publishing a Web site in Chapter 10.
	
Throughout this book, I use Adobe Dreamweaver CS4, but most of the features 
I cover have not changed much in the last few versions, so even if you’re using 
another version of Dreamweaver, such as 8 or CS3, you should be able to follow 
most of these instructions with few, if any, adjustments. Just be aware that some 
panels and other options may be in different locations in earlier versions.
Working with an existing Web site
If you’re working on redesigning or editing 
an existing site, your first challenge is to 
get a copy of the site on your hard drive. 
Fortunately, Dreamweaver can help you 
download an existing site off a Web server 
with the same features you use to publish 
a site. All you need is the login information, 
username, and password to access the Web 
server.
To download an existing site, first complete 
the site setup process featured at the begin­
ning of this chapter. Then create a new, 
blank folder where you can store all files in 
the Web site on your local hard drive. Follow 
the instructions in the section “Setting Up 
FTP in Dreamweaver” in Chapter 10 to con­
nect Dreamweaver with your server. After 
you establish a connection, just select all the 
files on the server and click the Get button 
(also shown in Chapter 10) to download all 
files in the existing site.
After you have your site on your hard 
drive, you can edit and add pages using 
Dreamweaver just like you would edit any 
other files on your computer, even if the site 
was created in another Web design program. 
Keep in mind, however, that if you’re doing 
a major redesign of an existing site, you 
might be better off to start from scratch. In 
that case, you can download the existing site 
into one folder, and then create a new site 
in another root folder in Dreamweaver. With 
both the old and new versions of a site on 
your hard drive, it’s easy to copy the exist­
ing text, images, and other materials into the 
new pages as you create the new site.

Defining a Web Site in Dreamweaver
If the site-definition process seems a little confusing at first, don’t 
worry; it’s a quick, relatively painless process, and you have to do it 
only once for each site. Just trust me — don’t skip this preliminary step.
Whether you’re creating a new site or working on an existing site, the 
following steps walk you through the process of defining a local root 
folder for your Web site.
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Choose Site➪New Site to open the Site 
Definition dialog box.
	2.	 Click the Advanced tab. Note: If you prefer, 
you can use the basic wizard that steps you 
through the setup process, but I find it faster 
and easier to view all the options at once 
from the Advanced tab.
Browse icon
	3.	 In the Category box on the left, make sure that the Local 
Info category is selected so that you can specify the loca­
tion of the folder on your local hard drive. This category 
should be open by default when you click the Advanced 
tab. (You find instructions for setting up the options in the 
Remote category so that you can publish your site to a 
Web server in Chapter 10.)

98
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	6.	 Click the Browse icon next to the Default Images 
folder field and then select the images folder in 
an existing Web site. If you’re creating a new 
site, create a new folder inside your local root 
folder, name it images, and select it. Although 
you don’t have to identify an images folder, it 
has some advantages. For example, if you ever 
insert an image that isn’t located in your local 
root folder, Dreamweaver copies it into the 
images folder you identify during the site setup 
process. If you create an images folder, 
Dreamweaver copies images into the main 
folder. (You can also store images in other fold­
ers within your local root folder.)
	4.	 In the Site Name text box, type a name for your 
site. You can call your site whatever you like; this 
name is used only to help you keep track of your 
sites. Many people work on more than one site in 
Dreamweaver, and this feature enables you to 
keep track of them by name. The name you enter 
here appears in the drop-down list in the Files 
panel and in the Manage Sites dialog box. You use 
this list to select the site you want to work on 
when you open Dreamweaver. In this example, I 
named the new site Pamela’s Pet Services.
	5.	 Click the Browse icon next to the Local Root 
Folder text box to locate the folder on your hard 
drive that you want to serve as the main folder for 
all files in your Web site. (Hint: The Browse icon 
in Dreamweaver always looks like a small, yellow 
file folder and is usually located at the right side of 
a text field.) If you’re setting up a new site, create a 
new folder on your hard drive, using the Create 
New Folder icon in the Choose Local Folder dialog, 
and then select that folder as the local root folder. 
If you’re setting up an existing Web site, select the 
folder that contains the files for that site to desig­
nate it as the Local Root Folder.
	7.	 For the Links Relative To radio buttons, leave the 
Document option selected unless you know that you 
want your links to be set up relative to the root level of 
your site. This setting controls how the path is set in 
links. If you’re working on a site with other developers 
and you’re not sure, check with your colleagues. If 
you’re working alone on your own site, Links Relative to 
Document is the simplest option and should already be 
selected because it’s the default option in Dreamweaver.

99
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	8.	 In the HTTP Address text box, type the URL of 
your Web site. The HTTP address is the URL, or 
Web address, that your site will have when it’s 
published on a Web server (see Chapter 2). If 
you don’t yet know the Web address for your 
site or you don’t plan to publish it on a Web 
server, you can leave this box blank. If you do 
fill it in, include http:// at the beginning and / 
at the end.
	9.	 Select the Use Case-Sensitive Link Checking check box. 
Unless you know for sure that you don’t have to worry 
about the case of your filenames, selecting this box 
makes Dreamweaver ensure that the case matches for 
all your site’s links (which many Web hosting services 
require).
	10.	Select the Enable Cache option. Dreamweaver 
creates a local cache of your site to quickly refer­
ence the location of files in your site. The local 
cache speeds up many site management features 
of the program and takes only a few seconds to 
create.
	11.	Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box and save 
your settings. If the folder you selected as your local 
site folder already contains files or subfolders, they’re 
automatically cached and any files or folders in your 
site are displayed in the Files panel. In this example, 
because I’m creating a new site, only the images sub­
folder is displayed. If you haven’t checked the Enable 
Cache option, a message box appears, asking whether 
you want to create a cache for the site. Doing so is good 
practice because it helps Dreamweaver work more 
efficiently.
	
You can make changes and additions to a site by choosing Site➪Manage Sites, selecting the site name in the 
Manage Sites dialog box, and then clicking the Edit button. The defined site then opens in the Site Definition 
dialog box, where you can make changes to any setting, such as selecting a different images folder or local 
root folder. Remember that if you move the local root folder on your hard drive, you need to edit the site defini­
tion to identify the new folder location.

100
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	12.	 If you work on more than one site in Dreamweaver, be sure to 
define each site the first time you work on it. After that, you can 
easily switch among defined sites by selecting the one you want 
to work on in the Files panel. You can define as many sites as 
you like in Dreamweaver. To load a different site into the Files 
panel, click the drop-down arrow next to the site name and 
choose the name of the site you want to display. In this figure, 
you can see that I’m opening the site named Pamela’s Pet 
Services by selecting it from a long list of defined sites.
Naming Web pages
Filenames are especially important in Web 
sites because they’re included in the HTML 
code when you set links. Over the years, 
I have received more e-mail messages 
from panicked Web designers because of 
broken links caused by filename conflicts 
than almost any other issue. Because these 
problems usually don’t occur until after 
a Web site is published on a server, they 
can be especially confusing and difficult to 
understand. Following a few simple point­
ers can help you avoid or troubleshoot 
filename-related problems:
	✓	 When you save Web pages, images, and 
other files for your site, the basic rule is 
to not use blank spaces or special char­
acters in a filename. For example, don’t 
name a Web page with an apostrophe, 
such as cat’s page.html. If you want 
to separate words, you can use an 
underscore (_) or a hyphen (-). For exam­
ple, cat-page.html is an acceptable 
filename. Numbers are okay in most 
cases, and capital letters don’t generally 
matter, as long as the filename and the 
code in the link match.
	
	The potentially misleading point is that 
links with spaces and special characters 
work just fine when you test pages on a 
Mac or PC, but the software used on 
many of the Web servers on the Internet 
don’t accept spaces or special charac­
ters in links. Thus, links that don’t follow 
these rules can be broken when you 
publish the site to a Web server.
	✓	 All files in a Web site must also include 
an extension at the end of the filename 
to identify the file type (such as .html 
for HTML files or .jpg for JPEG images). 
Dreamweaver automatically adds the 
.html file extension to the end of HTML 
files, but you may need to change your 
Windows settings if you want to be able 
to see the extension. Similarly, pro­
grams like Photoshop automatically add 
the extension on Windows computers; if 
you’re using a Macintosh, you may need 
to add the extensions manually.
	✓	 Another confusing rule, and one of the 
most important, is that the main page 
(or front page) of your Web site must be 
named index.html or default.html, 
depending on your Web server. Most 
Web servers are set up to serve the 
index.html page first. To ensure that 
you use the correct name, check with 
your service provider or system admin­
istrator. (Some servers are set up to 
handle home.html, or default.asp for 
dynamic sites, but most commercial ser­
vice providers serve index.html before 
any other page in any folder in a site.) 
The rest of the pages in your site can be 
named anything you like, as long as they 
don’t include spaces or special charac­
ters (except for the dash or underscore).

101
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
In this task, I show you how easy it is to create a new page in 
Dreamweaver and add and format text. Whether you’re creating a 
simple design or a complex one, it’s almost always easier to start with 
one of the prestyled Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) layouts included in 
Dreamweaver. You can use Dreamweaver’s collection of layouts to 
create a variety of one, two, and three-column designs using CSS, and as 
you see in the steps that follow, you can customize these layouts in 
many ways. Before you rush off to take a look at all the layouts included 
with Dreamweaver, let me warn you that they’re not much to look at 
when you first open them. They’re intentionally designed with a basic, 
gray color scheme. Fortunately, though, color styles are some of the 
easiest to alter in CSS.
If you’re new to CSS, altering one of these layouts may seem confusing at 
first, but it’s certainly easier than starting a page layout from scratch your­
self. In this chapter, I focus on a simple, one-column design, a great way to 
practice the basics before you get into the steps you’ll need to follow to 
customize the more complex layouts included in the templates later in this 
book. Before you begin creating new pages, make sure that you complete 
the site setup process covered in the preceding task in this chapter.
	1.	 To create a new page, choose File➪
New. In the New Document dialog 
box that opens, choose Blank Page 
from the options on the far left (as 
shown here). Under the Page Type 
column, you can now select from 
many different file types, including 
HTML, XML, and PHP. To create a 
simple Web page, like the one I use 
throughout this book, choose HTML.
	
A fixed layout is generally an easier option to start with, but “liquid” designs have advantages because they’re 
more flexible. You can find a longer description of the layout types in the Dreamweaver Help files, but essen­
tially here are the options. Liquid layouts are designed to expand and contract, depending upon the size of the 
browser window; fixed layouts are centered within the browser and set to a width of 780 pixels (easy to 
change); elastic layouts use the EMs measurement to adapt to different text sizes and other variations in dis­
play; and hybrid layouts use a mix of options.

Creating New Pages in Dreamweaver
Time needed:
Less than half an

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 When HTML is selected in the New Document 
dialog box, a list of CSS layouts appears in the 
Layout Column. In the close-up view of this 
dialog box, shown in this figure, you can see 
that I selected a design that creates a one-
column fixed layout with a header and footer. 
The rest of the options in this dialog are 
optional, so keep things simple and just 
click the Create button.
	3.	 Get into the (excellent) habit of 
saving a new page as soon as it’s 
created. Choose File➪Save and give 
the file a name. Remember, don’t 
use any spaces or special charac­
ters in the filename, and be sure to 
retain the .html extension. I 
named this file index.html 
because it will serve as the first 
page of my site. As soon as you 
save the file, it’s also good practice 
to add a title right away by replac­
ing the words Untitled Page with 
your own title at the top of the 
workspace, as you see in this 
figure.
	4.	 Adding or editing text in a new 
page in Dreamweaver is relatively 
simple. For example, if you want to 
change the text at the top of the 
page, just select the word Header 
and type in the text you want to 
use to replace it. In this case, I 
entered Pamela’s Pet Services. 
Because I selected the Header first, 
the font, style, and size of the text 
in the original layout are preserved. 
Replace the subheadings and main 
text in the page in the same way.

103
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	5.	 All Dreamweaver layouts include a collection of corre­
sponding styles. As a result, to edit many of the ele­
ments, such as the background color of the header area, 
you must edit the corresponding style. First, open the 
CSS Styles panel (if it’s not already open) by choosing 
Window➪CSS Styles, and then click the plus (+) sign next 
to <style> (or whatever the external style sheet is 
named) to open it. Dreamweaver displays all styles that 
correspond to the style sheet associated with this page. 
(Tip: Make sure that the All button is selected at the top 
of the CSS Styles panel to display all styles.)
Inserting text from another program
Dreamweaver gives you many options for 
maintaining formatting when you copy 
and paste text from another program. You 
can change the default method for how 
Dreamweaver handles formatting when 
you choose Edit➪Paste and alter the prefer­
ences in the Copy/Paste category. And, you 
can choose Edit➪Paste Special to make all 
options available each time you paste new 
content. Here are your six options:
	✓	 Text Only: Dreamweaver strips any for­
matting and inserts plain text.
	✓	 Text with Structure: Dreamweaver 
includes paragraphs, lists, tables, and 
other structural formatting options.
	✓	 Text with Structure Plus Basic 
Formatting: Dreamweaver includes 
structural formatting as well as basic 
formatting, such as bold and italic.
	✓	 Text with Structure Plus Full Formatting: 
In addition to the previous options, 
Dreamweaver includes formatting cre­
ated by style sheets in programs such as 
Microsoft Word.
	✓	 Retain Line Breaks: Selecting this check 
box ensures that line breaks are pre­
served, even if you don’t keep other for­
matting options.
	✓	 Clean Up Word Paragraph Spacing: This 
option is designed to address a common 
problem in the way Microsoft Word 
paragraph spacing is converted when 
content is pasted into an HTML file.

104
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	6.	 To change the color or other style options 
for the header, double-click the style named 
.oneColFixCtrHdr #header to open it in the 
CSS Rule Definition dialog box. Click to select 
the Background category, and use the color pal­
ette to change the background color. Choose 
the Type category to access font, size, and other 
text options. Click Apply to see how the settings 
look, and then click OK to save them and close 
the dialog box. 
	
This is an advanced tip. If you don’t like the compound styles used in Dreamweaver layouts, you can simplify 
them. Dreamweaver includes a body class for each of these layouts and includes it in the name of each 
style. In this case, the body class is oneColFixCtrHdr. You can remove the body class by deleting 
.oneColFixCtrHdr from the front of each style name, but if you do so, you must also delete it from the 
body tag in the HTML code. To do so, first click the Split View button at the top of the workspace to open the 
HTML code, and then search for the body tag and delete class=”oneColFixCtrHdr”. Although remov­
ing the class style is optional, it simplifies the rest of the style names by making them all shorter, which many 
designers find easier when working with style sheets. To save you from having to find the body tag in the HTML 
code, I leave the longer style names the way Dreamweaver creates them in this task.
	7.	 To change the width of the one-column layout, you need 
to edit the Div tag that surrounds all the content on the 
page. By following the common practice of using Div 
tags to “contain” elements on a page and styles, to 
describe how they should be displayed, Dreamweaver 
includes a Div identified as container in every layout. 
The container controls the overall width of the design 
area; to change the width of your design, you need to 
change the corresponding style. To do so, double-click 
the style named .oneColFixCtrHdr #container to 
open it in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box. (The Div is 
the foundation of the box model, which I explain in 
Chapter 4.)

105
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	8.	 In the CSS Rule Definition dialog, choose Box 
from the Category list (left) and then use the 
width field to change the width as desired. In this 
case, I’m changing the width from 780 pixels to 
980 by replacing the number in the Width field. 
Limiting the width of your page to 780 pixels is 
good practice if you want your page to display 
well in an 800 x 600 resolution monitor, but most 
Web designers today design for a monitor resolu­
tion of 1024 x 786 and a width of 980 is well 
suited to that size, leaving just enough room for 
scrollbars and other elements of the browser 
that take up space on the screen. Click Apply to 
preview your changes, and then click OK to save 
your changes and close the dialog box.
	9.	 You can also change the font or color of any or 
all text on a page by changing the corresponding 
styles. If you aren’t familiar with HTML, you may 
not guess that to change the font style for the 
entire page, you need to alter the Body style. 
That’s because the <body> tag controls page-
wide settings, like font face and link styles. You 
can use multiple fonts on a page by changing the 
font style for a specific section of text, but to 
change the default font for the entire page, 
double-click Body in the CSS Styles panel, 
choose the Type category and use the Font-
family drop-down list to select a font collection.
	
If the body tag isn’t already defined with a style, you might find it easier to use the Page Properties dialog box, 
described in the section, “Changing Page-Wide Settings with Page Properties,” later in this chapter. For more 
information on font collections and using XHTML and CSS together, see Chapter 4.  

106
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Adding paragraphs and line breaks
When you create page designs for the Web, 
you must work within many limitations that 
might be confusing at first, even if they 
serve a purpose. How you create paragraph 
and line breaks is a good example.
If you’re working in Design view in 
Dreamweaver and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac), Dreamweaver inserts a <p> 
(Paragraph) tag in the code, which creates 
a line break followed by a blank line. If you 
want a line break without the extra blank line, 
hold down the Shift key and press Enter or 
Return; Dreamweaver inserts the <br /> tag 
into the code, to create a single line break.
If you want to add a lot of space, press 
Enter or Return multiple times to have 
Dreamweaver insert <p>&nbsp;</p>. 
These Open and Close paragraph tags have 
a nonbreaking space in the middle.
You can also add space to a page by using 
margins or padding settings in CSS styles. 
You find instructions for working with these 
style options in the section, “Creating New 
Pages in Dreamweaver,” earlier in this 
chapter.
Note that you can add as much space as 
you like to HTML code without changing the 
page design. If you’re working in Code view 
in Dreamweaver, you can add space within 
the code by pressing Enter or Return with­
out affecting the way the page appears in a 
Web browser.

107
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
You can add images in the JPEG, PNG, or GIF format to your pages in 
Dreamweaver. In Chapter 5, you discover how to optimize images for 
the Web. In this task, you learn how to insert image into a Web page in 
Dreamweaver.
	1.	 For many designs, such as the one featured in this task 
for Pamela’s Pet Services, you may want to use a graphic 
instead of text in the Header. First, simply delete the text 
in the Header area, and then choose Insert➪Image to 
select the graphic you want to use in its place. If you 
insert a graphic that’s not in your local root folder, 
Dreamweaver automatically copies it into your images 
folder. Unless you have Accessibility Attributes turned 
off in the Dreamweaver preferences, you’re also 
prompted to enter alternate text. Type a description of 
your image in the Alternate text field in the Image Tag 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box. Alternatively, you 
can click to select any image and type a description into 
the Alt field in the Property Inspector.

Alternate text, which is displayed if an image isn’t visible, provides a description of the image for visitors who 
are visually impaired and use special browsers that “read” Web pages aloud. Including key words in Alt text can 
also make your page more search engine friendly.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 Although I changed the width of the 
layout to match the width of my 
banner (in the previous task), the 
banner didn’t line up properly when 
I inserted it into the header. That’s 
because the header is styled for text 
and includes padding to better posi­
tion the text away from the sides of 
the layout. To make an image, such 
as this banner fit in the header prop­
erly, you need to remove the extra 
space. First, click the style named 
.oneColFixCtrHdr #header in 
the CSS Styles panel. Then expand 
the Styles panel to display the 
Properties for the #header style 
and delete everything in the padding 
field by selecting it and pressing the 
Delete key.
	3.	 Even after deleting the padding, you’re still likely to 
have extra space at the top and bottom of the banner; 
this space is caused by the H1 tag attributes that make 
the header text large and bold. If you deleted the H1 tag 
when you deleted the text, you won’t have this problem, 
but it’s easy to leave the H1 tag behind. Here’s a good 
way to remove any unwanted HTML formatting. First, 
click to place your cursor in the Header area. (It doesn’t 
matter whether you select the image). Then in the tag 
selector at the bottom of the workspace, right-click the 
H1 tag and choose Remove Tag.
	4.	 To insert an image in an area of the page 
where you have text, click to place your 
cursor where you want the image to appear 
and then choose Insert➪Image. Find the 
image you want to insert on your hard drive 
and double-click to select it. If it’s not 
already in your root folder, click Yes to let 
Dreamweaver copy it into the main folder of 
your site. Finally, add a text description in 
the Alternative text field in the Image Tag 
Accessibility dialog and then click OK. The 
image appears in the page, forcing any text 
down below it.

109
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	
You can adjust the margins and padding around images, Div tags, and other elements to control spacing and 
positioning. The simplest way to understand padding and margins is to remember this statement: Padding adds 
space to the inside of an element, and margins add space to the outside. The same statement is true whether 
the element is a Div tag, an image, a table cell, or anything else. If you want more space around a photo, for 
example, add margin space. If you want a gap between the edge of a Div tag and its contents, add padding. 
Here’s an advanced tip: When you add padding, you increase the overall size of the element. For example, a 
photo that’s 200 px wide and has 10 px of padding on each side expands to fill 220 px of space in the design.
	5.	 To align an image to the right or left 
and wrap the text around it, your 
best option is to use a CSS style. In 
all the templates included with this 
book, and in many of the CSS 
Layouts included with Dreamweaver, 
you’ll find styles with the name 
fltrt (or float-right) for aligning 
images to the right, and fltlft (or 
float-left), for aligning images to the 
left. To use these styles, first click 
to select the image. Then, in the 
Property Inspector, click the Class 
drop-down list and choose the 
alignment style you want to use. In 
this example, I selected fltlft.
	6.	 The alignment styles, such as float-right and 
float-left, include a margin setting of 8 pixels 
(px) to create a small margin between an 
image and any text that wraps around it 
when it’s aligned to the left or right of a page. 
You can change the margin settings to 
increase or decrease this space by clicking 
to select the style in the CSS Styles panel, 
and then changing the number of pixels in 
the Properties pane. Alternatively, you can 
double-click the style name to open the CSS 
Rule definition dialog and change the margin 
settings in the Box category.

110 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Dreamweaver is truly a dream when it comes to setting links. The most 
important thing to keep in mind is that a link is essentially an address (a 
URL) that tells a visitor’s browser which page to open when the visitor 
clicks the text or image containing the link.
If the page you want to link to is within your Web site, you can create a 
relative link, which includes a path describing how to get from the cur­
rent page to the linked page. A relative link doesn’t need to include the 
domain name of the site — just the instructions for a browser to move 
from one page within your site to another. (If you want to link to a page 
outside your site, see the next section, “Linking to Another Web Site.”)
When you link from one page to another page in your Web site, the 
most important thing to remember is to save your pages in your site’s 
root folder (as described in “Defining a Web Site in Dreamweaver,” ear­
lier in this chapter) before you start setting links. Here’s how to create a 
link from one page to another within a Web site:
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, open the page where you want to 
create a link. Select the text or image that you want to 
serve as the link (the text or image that a user clicks to 
trigger the link). Click and drag to highlight text, or 
click once to select an image. In this example, I select 
the text Learn more about our boarding 
services, and I want to link it to a page named 
boarding.html located in a folder named services. 
Note that all these files and folders are located inside 
the local root folder that I defined for this site in 
Dreamweaver.
	2.	 To set the link, click the Link icon on 
the Common Insert panel to open the 
Hyperlink dialog box. (Alternatively, 
you can choose Insert➪Hyperlink.)

	3.	 In the Hyperlink dialog box, click the Browse 
icon (the yellow file folder) to the right of the 
Link field. In the Select File dialog box that 
appears, navigate on your hard drive to the 
page to which you want to link your image or 
text. Click to select the filename of the page, and 
then click OK (in Windows) or Choose (on a 
Mac). The rest of the settings in this dialog box 
are optional. (See sidebar on “Targeting how 
links open”.)
	4.	 The link is automatically set, and the dialog 
box closes. If you create a link by using text, 
as I do in this example, the text changes to 
reflect the style for a link. By default, Active 
links appear underlined and in dark blue. To 
test your links, you must view the page in a 
Web browser. Choose File➪Preview in 
Browser and then choose any browser you 
associated with Dreamweaver to preview the 
page and test the link. For more detailed 
instructions on previewing a page in a Web 
browser, see Chapter 10.
	
If you haven’t already saved your page, a message box opens, explaining that you can create a relative link only 
after you save the page. Always save the page you’re working on before you set links.
Targeting how links open
When you create a link in Dreamweaver, 
you can specify the Target options by 
using the Target drop-down menu in the 
Properties inspector, or by selecting a 
Target option when you set the link in 
the Hyperlink dialog. These are the target 
options and their effect:
	✓	 _blank: Opens the linked page in a new 
browser window.
	✓	 _parent: Opens the linked page in the 
parent frameset or window that con­
tains the link. 
	✓	 _self: Opens the linked page into the 
same frame or window as the link. This 
is the default, so if you don’t specify a 
target, it should open in the same 
window. 
	✓	 _top: Opens the linked page into a full 
browser window, which removes any 
frames if they are in use.

112 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Linking to a page on another Web site — called an external link — is 
even easier than linking to an internal link. All you need is the URL of 
the page to which you want to link, and you’re most of the way there.
To create an external link, follow these steps:
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, open the page 
from which you want to link and 
click to select an image, or click and 
drag to highlight the text that you 
want to act as a link. You can also 
click to select any image on the 
page to serve as the link. In this 
example, I selected the text visit 
www.petfinder.com., at the 
bottom of the page.
	2.	 In the Link text box in the Property 
Inspector, type the URL of the page you want 
your text or image to link to, and then press 
Enter (in Windows) or Return (on the Mac). 
You can also copy and paste a URL from the 
address bar in a Web browser, which is an 
excellent way to ensure that you don’t enter 
the address incorrectly. You must always 
use the full URL, including the http:// part, 
when you create an external link in HTML. 
Otherwise, the browser can’t find the correct 
external site address.

To test a link to another Web site, you must 
view your page in a browser and be con­
nected to the Internet. Choose File➪Preview 
in Browser and then choose any browser 
you’ve associated with Dreamweaver to pre­
view the page and test the link. For more 
detailed instructions on previewing your 
page in a browser, see Chapter 10.

 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
Another common link option directs site visitors to an e-mail address. 
Visitors can send you messages easily with e-mail links. I always recom­
mend that you invite visitors to contact you because they can point out 
mistakes in your site and give you valuable feedback about how you can 
further develop your site. Adding contact information also lends credi­
bility to a Web site because it shows that you’re accessible and open to 
being contacted.
Setting a link to an e-mail address is just as easy as setting a link to 
another Web page. All you need to know is the e-mail address you 
want to link to and which text or image you want to use when you set 
the link.
	1.	 To create an e-mail link, select the 
text that you want to serve as 
the link.
	2.	 With the text selected, click the Email Link icon on 
the Common Insert panel. Alternatively, you can 
choose Insert➪Email Link.

Setting a Link to an E-Mail Address
Time needed:
Less than 
15 minutes
	
When visitors to your Web site click an e-mail link, the visitor’s computer system automatically launches the 
default e-mail program and creates a blank e-mail message to the specified e-mail address. This is a cool trick, 
but it can be disconcerting to users who don’t expect it to happen, and it doesn’t work if they don’t have an 
e-mail program on their computer. That’s why I always try to let users know when I use an e-mail link. For 
example, rather than just link the words Contact Janine, I link the words Email Janine. Even better, I often link 
the actual e-mail address.

114
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	4.	 The Email Link dialog box works only with text. If you want to use an image as 
an e-mail link, you must select the image and then enter the e-mail address, 
preceded by mailto: in the Link field in the Property Inspector. In this exam­
ple, the image is selected, and the e-mail link has been created by entering 
mailto:info@pamelaspetservices.com.
	
When you create an e-mail link on a Web page to be displayed on the public Internet, you open yourself to 
spammers, some of whom use automated programs to “lift” e-mail addresses off Web pages. That’s why many 
sites don’t include e-mail links, but instead use text such as “Send e-mail to Janine at jcwarner dot-com.” You 
can also use a form to get around this potential problem. By setting up a form with a script that delivers the 
form’s contents to an e-mail address, you can shield your e-mail address from spammers while still making it 
easy for visitors to your site to send comments. A relatively new alternative is offered by the Web site 
AddressMunger.com, which you can use to create a special script that shields your e-mail address from spam­
mers. You can find more information in Chapter 15 about AddressMunger.com and other services that you can 
use to enhance your Web site.
	3.	 In the Email Link dialog box that opens, enter 
the e-mail address in the E-Mail field and click 
OK. The dialog box closes and the text automati­
cally changes to the style for an active link.

115
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
You can change many individual elements on a page in the Property 
Inspector, but if you want to make changes that affect the entire page, 
such as changing the background color of the entire page or changing 
the way links and text are formatted, you can use the Page Properties 
dialog box. Although you can apply global settings, such as text size 
and color, in the Page Properties dialog box, you can override those set­
tings with other formatting options in specific instances. For example, 
you can set all text to the Helvetica font in the page properties and then 
change the font for an individual headline to Verdana via the Font field 
in the Property Inspector. To change the font settings, background and 
text colors, and link colors for an entire page, follow these steps:
	1.	 Choose Modify➪Page Properties or click the 
Page Properties button in the Property 
Inspector to open the Page Properties dialog 
box. Select the Appearance (CSS) category, click 
the Page Font drop-down list, and choose the 
font collection you want to serve as the main 
font for the text on your page. (See the earlier 
sidebar “Why so many fonts?” in Chapter 4.)

	2.	 In the Size drop-down list, specify the font size 
you want for the text on your page. (In this 
example, I selected 100%, but you can choose 
from a variety of size settings.) Click the Text 
Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. 
Choose any color you want for the text color on 
the page. The color you select fills the color 
swatch box but doesn’t change the text color on 
the page until you click Apply or OK.
	
When you change the background, text, or link colors, make sure that the colors look good together and that 
your text is still readable. As a general rule, go for high contrast pairings: light text is best displayed on a dark 
background, and dark text is best displayed on a light background.

116
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	3.	 Click the Background Color swatch box and 
choose a color if you want to fill the background 
of the page with a solid color. If you want to 
insert a graphic into the background of your 
page, as I did here, click the Browse button next 
to the Background Image box, and in the Select 
Image Source dialog box that appears, select 
an image and click OK to return to the Page 
Properties dialog box. When you insert a back­
ground image, it automatically repeats (or tiles) 
across and down the page unless you choose the 
no-repeat option from the Repeat drop-down list 
or use CSS to further define the display.
	4.	 Use the margin options at the bottom of the 
dialog box to change the left, right, top, or 
bottom margins of your page. Entering 0 in all 
four fields removes the default margin settings, 
which automatically add margin space at the top 
and left side of a Web page, enabling you to 
create designs whose edges begin flush with the 
edge of a browser. Most professional designers 
prefer to set the margins to 0 and then use other 
CSS settings to control the positioning of the 
design within a browser window.
	5.	 To alter the display of links on a page, first select the 
Links (CSS) category from the left side of the Page 
Properties dialog box. Specify the font face and size you 
want for the links on your page. If you don’t specify a 
font, links appear in the same font and size that are 
specified for the text in your document. 
	
Although you can vary the link styles to suit the design of your site, it’s good practice to use the same link styles 
throughout your site so that your visitors can easily identify links.

117
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	6.	 To the right of the Link Font drop-down list, 
click the B or I icon if you want all links on your 
page to appear in bold or italic, respectively. 
Specify a color for any link option (or all link 
options) by clicking the color palette and select­
ing a color for each of the link states separately. 
The color you select is applied to links on your 
page based on the link state. All four link states 
can be displayed in the same or different colors:
 
• Link Color: This option controls the 
color in which a link appears when 
it’s first displayed on a page.
 
• Visited Links: This option controls 
the color of links that a visitor has 
already clicked, or visited.
 
• Rollover Links: A link changes to this 
color when a user rolls the cursor 
over the link (also known as hovering).
 
• Active Links: A link changes to this 
color briefly while a user is actively 
clicking it.
	7.	 In the Underline Style drop-down list, specify 
whether you want links underlined. By default, 
all links on a Web page appear underlined in a 
browser, but many designers find the underline 
distracting and prefer to turn it off by selecting 
Never Underline. You can also choose Show 
Underline Only on Rollover to make the under­
line appear when a user moves a cursor over a 
link. Hide Underline on Rollover causes the 
underline to disappear when a user moves a 
cursor over a link.
	8.	 As you alter the different settings, you can 
click the Apply button to see how the 
changes appear on your page. After you 
specify all the settings, click OK to finish and 
close the Page Properties dialog box.

118 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Defining New Styles in Dreamweaver
Whether you create a new, blank page in Dreamweaver or start with 
one of the Dreamweaver CSS layouts, as described in an earlier task in 
this chapter, you can create your own styles to format text, images, and 
other elements in your pages.
As you move through the steps to create a new style in Dreamweaver, 
you might be surprised by the number of options in the numerous 
panels and dialog boxes available for creating CSS. As you explore the 
possibilities, remember that you can leave attributes unspecified if you 
don’t want to use them and that you can always go back and edit styles 
after you create them.
To define a new style, either create a new document or open an existing 
Web page in Dreamweaver and follow these steps:
Toolbox:
✓	 Adobe Dreamweaver CS4
✓	 A page or Web site you 
where you want to add a 
new style
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
	2.	 In the New CSS Rule dialog box, choose the type 
of CSS selector you want to create from the 
Selector Type drop-down menu. (If you need a 
refresher on the four selector options and choos­
ing selector types, see Chapter 4.) In this exam­
ple, I’m creating a class style that I will use to 
format the captions for my images. In the 
Selector Name field, type a name. Because 
class styles must begin with a period (.), 
I named this style .imagecaption. 
Time needed:
About 15 minutes

119
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	3.	 In the Rule Definition area at the bottom of the New CSS 
Rule dialog box, select where you want to define your 
new style. Choose This Document Only from the drop-
down menu to create an internal style sheet. In this 
example, I’m adding my new style to an external style 
sheet that’s already attached to my page (design.css). 
To create an external style sheet, click to select the 
name of the style sheet, or choose New Style Sheet File 
to create a new style sheet file as you create the style. If 
you choose to create a new style sheet, enter a name in 
the Save Style Sheet File As dialog box and then click 
Save to continue. Usually, you want to add a style to an 
external style sheet; see Chapter 4 for details about 
internal versus external style sheets.
	4.	 In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, choose a 
category on the left. For this example, I chose 
the Type category to specify font options for 
this style because I want the font to be different 
from the main page font. As you can see in this 
figure, I chose the Georgia, Times New Roman, 
Times, serif font collection; set the Font size to 
Small; and set the Font weight to Bold. (See 
Chapter 4 for more information about font col­
lections.) Click OK to save the style and close 
the dialog box.

120
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	5.	 The new style appears at the bottom of the 
CSS Styles panel. You can change the order 
of styles by clicking to select a style name 
and dragging it to another position in the 
panel.
	6.	 To apply a new class style, like the one I cre­
ated in this task, select a section of text in a 
Web page and then use the Class drop-down 
list to select and apply the style. For more 
information on how to apply other kinds of 
styles, see Chapter 4.

Creating and Using Templates
After all the time you spend creating a page design in Dreamweaver, 
you might be pleased to know about templates. When you save a file as 
a Dreamweaver Web Template, it becomes available from the New File 
dialog box, which makes it easy to use to create new pages quickly. But 
the greatest time-saving benefit of Dreamweaver’s Web Templates 
becomes evident when you want to make changes to a design after you 
use it to create numerous pages because you can use templates to 
make global updates across many pages at once.
Most of the templates included with this book use the Dreamweaver 
Web Template features. Reading through this task not only shows you 
how to create your own templates but also helps you better understand 
how to use and edit the templates that you can download to use with this 
book. To find the templates, just go to www.DigitalFamily.com/diy.
In this task, you learn how to save any page as a template, use the tem­
plate to create new pages, and then edit the template to make global 
updates to those pages.
	1.	 To create a new template, choose File➪New. 
In the New Document dialog box that 
appears, choose Blank Template and then 
choose the Type and Layout just as you 
would to create a new page. (See the 
“Creating New Pages in Dreamweaver” task 
earlier in this chapter.) You also can turn 
any existing page in Dreamweaver into a 
template by using the Save As Template 
option. In this task, I build on a page from an 
earlier task by turning it into a template. To 
do so, open any Web page in Dreamweaver 
and choose File➪Save As Template.
Stuff You 
Need to Know

122
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 In the Save As Template dialog box, make sure 
that the site you’re working on is displayed in 
the Site field. (This should happen automatically 
if you completed the site definition process; if 
you haven’t, make sure to do so by following the 
steps in the first task in this chapter.) You can 
name the template anything you like as long as 
you don’t use spaces or punctuation. When you’re 
prompted by the Update Links dialog box, 
choose Yes to preserve any links to pages or 
images in the file.
	3.	 When you create a Web Template, Dreamweaver auto­
matically adds the .dwt extension. In this case, my file 
is named services.dwt. As you can see in the Files 
panel shown in this figure, Dreamweaver automatically 
stores the new template in a folder named Templates. If 
you don’t already have a Templates folder in your local 
root folder, Dreamweaver creates one for you when you 
save your first template. If Dreamweaver prompts you 
to update links as you save the page as a template, 
click Yes.
	
Although the Dreamweaver layouts are designed to display CSS and other formatting options according to con­
temporary standards, not all Web browsers support CSS the same way, so it’s always wise to test your designs 
in a variety of Web browsers before you publish them. And here’s a tip: Internet Explorer and Safari do not dis­
play Dreamweaver Web Templates, but Firefox does. Thus, if you’re working on a template and want to preview 
your work as you go along, choose File➪Preview in Browser and then choose Firefox from the list of browsers. 
(You find more detailed instructions in Chapter 10 for previewing your pages in multiple Web browsers and for 
adding new browsers to the preview list in Dreamweaver.)

123
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	
Any area that’s not an editable region can only be edited in the template itself, and any edits you make to a part 
of the page that isn’t designated as editable will automatically be updated on all the pages created from the 
page. For example, I wouldn’t make the banner at the top of this page an editable region because I want to use 
the same banner at the top of every page in this site.
	4.	 Before you use your template to create new pages, you need to create editable regions 
in the template: areas of the template that can be edited in new pages created from the 
template. You create editable regions where you want to be able to add unique content 
to a new page created from the template, such as the photos and stories you will want 
to use in the main part of each page. To create an editable region, first select a con­
tainer, such as the mainContent div, that contains the text and image in the middle 
of this page. To select the mainContent div, I place my cursor in the content and 
then clicked the mainContent tag in the tag selector at the bottom of the page.

124
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	7.	 After you define all editable regions, choose 
File➪Save to save the template. When you’re 
ready to create a new page from the template, 
choose File➪New, just as you would do to 
create any new page in Dreamweaver. In the 
New Document dialog box, choose Page from 
Template from the left-hand column, choose the 
site you’re working on from the middle column, 
and then choose the template you want from 
the right column. Notice that Dreamweaver 
includes a preview of the template at the far 
right side of the dialog box.
	6.	 In the New Editable Region dialog box that opens, give the 
region a name (no spaces or special characters!), and then 
click OK. I enter the name Main in this example. If you 
don’t have visual aids turned off, Dreamweaver will distin­
guish the editable region by surrounding it with a blue line 
and including a small tab at the top with the name you 
gave the region. Repeat Steps 4, 5, and 6, selecting differ­
ent containers in turn to create additional editable regions.
	5.	 With a container selected, such as the 
mainContent div, choose Insert➪Template 
Objects➪Editable Region.

125
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
	10.	To save your changes and update any pages 
created from the template at the same time, 
choose File➪Save. In the Update Template Files 
dialog box, click Update. Dreamweaver lists all 
pages created from the template in this dialog 
box so that you can see exactly which pages 
will change. If you don’t want to apply the 
changes to your pages, choose Don’t Update. 
All new pages created from the template will 
include the changes you made.
	9.	 At any time, you can go back to the 
template to make changes to any 
area of the template that isn’t an edit­
able region, and those changes will 
automatically be applied to any 
pages created from the template. In 
this example, I included copyright 
information in the footer of the page. 
Because it’s not an editable region, I 
can now change the year from 2009 
to 2010, and the footer will automati­
cally be updated on every page in 
the site created from the template.
	8.	 Always save a new page before you 
start editing it by choosing 
File➪Save, just as you would save 
any other new file in Dreamweaver. 
You can then edit any of the edit­
able regions in a page created from 
a template, adding images and text 
to the editable regions, such as 
this cat photo and text. Remember, 
however, that you can’t alter any of 
the areas that aren’t editable, such 
as the banner image at the top of 
the page, which can only be 
changed in the template. 

126 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
If you’ve heard of meta tags, you probably correctly associate them 
with search engines. Although meta tags are used for a variety of pur­
poses, the most common is to provide special text that doesn’t appear 
in the body of your page but is read by crawlers, bots, and other pro­
grams that scour the Web, reading the code behind Web pages and cat­
aloging and ranking those pages for Bing, Google, and a long list of 
other search-related sites.
Some search engines read meta tags for keywords and descriptions. 
The keyword meta tag enables site designers to specify a list of key­
words that match the content on their Web sites when someone types 
the same keywords into a search engine. The meta description tag is 
designed to let you include a written description of your Web site, and 
search engines often display its content as the brief description that 
appears in search results pages, so including a meta description in all 
your pages is definitely worthwhile. Follow these steps to fill in the 
meta description tag:
	1.	 Open the page where you want to add a meta 
description. You can use meta descriptions on 
any page, or all pages, on your Web site. 
Choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪Description. 
In the Description text box, enter the text you 
want for your page description. (Don’t add any 
HTML code in this box). When you click OK, the 
meta description is automatically added to the 
HTML code behind the page.

	2.	 To view or edit the Meta description after you 
create it, choose either the Split or Code view 
option by clicking the corresponding button at 
the top of the workspace. In this example, I 
selected Split so that both Code view and 
Design view are visible. To edit the meta 
description, locate it in the HTML code, and 
then you can delete, change, or add text as you 
would in Design view. The description text you 
enter is inserted into the Head area at the top of 
the page in the HTML code. Meta content 
doesn’t appear in the body of the page.
	
If you want to add keywords, repeat Steps 1 and 2 and choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪Keywords in Step 1.

 Chapter 6: Getting Started with Dreamweaver
Many of the services featured in this book, including Google AdSense, 
PayPal Buttons, and Google Analytics, require that you add a snippet of 
HTML code or JavaScript to your Web pages.
In many cases, you need to add the same code to one or more pages in 
a site. In the example featured in this task, I’m adding the code needed 
for Google Analytics, which measures traffic to a Web site and needs to 
be included at the bottom of every page on a site. In this case, the most 
efficient way to add the code is to insert it into the template page. 
Adding code to a template will add the code to every page created from 
the template simultaneously.
When you open Dreamweaver to add your code, leave your Web 
browser open so that it displays the page where you copied the code, 
in case you want to make changes or need to copy the code again. You 
can easily switch between two programs on your computer by pressing 
Alt+Tab (Windows) or Ô+Tab (Mac).
	1.	 The easiest way to add code to a page 
in Dreamweaver is click the Split View 
button in the upper-left corner of 
the workspace to display the code 
behind the page in the top part of the 
workspace. The advantage of using 
Split view is that you can see Design 
and Code views at the same time. 
Here’s a tip: When you’re working 
on code that adds a visible element 
to your page, click any element in 
Design view, such as the Copyright 
information in the footer at the bottom 
of this page, and Dreamweaver auto­
matically highlights the correspond­
ing code so that you can find your 
place more easily.

Inserting Code into a Web Page in Dreamweaver
Time needed:
About half 
an hour
	
One of the most confusing aspects of adding code to your site is that sometimes you see it in the design and 
other times you don’t. For example, when you add Google Analytics code to a page in Dreamweaver, no visible 
change takes place on the page in Design view because the analytics code is only used to measure traffic to the 
page with nothing visible to your visitors. However, some kinds of code, such as Google AdSense which displays 
ads in a Web page, can be viewed, but only when you preview a page in a Web browser. Another point that trips 
up new Web designers is that, for the code to take effect, you’ll need to upload the page to a Web server so that 
Google can find the AdSense code and begin tracking your traffic. You find instructions for publishing your pages 
in Dreamweaver and more about how to use Google Analytics in Chapter 10.

	2.	 Find the exact place where you want to add 
the code. Google Analytics should be added 
just above the </body> tag at the very end of 
a page. Click to place the cursor in the code; 
then choose Edit➪Paste to insert the code 
you copied from a Web site (like Google 
Analytics) into your page. Notice that the 
Google code is surrounded by <script> and 
</script> tags. If you ever want to delete or 
replace this code, make sure when you select 
the code that you include everything between 
and including the <script> tags.
	
The code you copy from a site like Google may include a script or other code that isn’t in basic HTML. This issue 
shouldn’t matter as long as you copy the code exactly as Google (or any other Web site) instructs you to and you 
paste all the code into the HTML in your Web page. For example, if the code begins with a <script> tag, it 
should include a closing </script> tag.

Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
I
ntroduce yourself to the world with a profile or portfolio site. 
A Web site about yourself is a powerful tool that can help you 
land your dream job, attract high-profile clients, or even reconnect 
with long-lost friends and family.
Perhaps the biggest challenge to creating a profile or portfolio site 
is determining the best way to summarize your life experience, tal­
ents, and body of work:
	 ✓	If you’re an artist, you can photograph your paintings or 
sculptures to create a visual portfolio of your work to display 
online.
	 ✓	If you’re a consultant, you can develop a collection of case 
studies describing your success with previous clients or fea­
turing your best designs.
	
		
✓	If you’re a writer, you can include a collection of published 
articles or showcase writing that hasn’t been published 
anywhere else — after all, a Web site enables you to become 
your own publisher.
No matter what you do, you probably want to create a biography about yourself. 
Whether your bio is serious or silly, trying to sum up your own life in a few para­
graphs is likely to be one of the most challenging things you will ever write (which 
is why I include a few tips for writing a great biography in the sidebar “Telling your 
own tale.”)
In this chapter, you also discover the basics of bringing your ideas to life on the 
Web. Working in Photoshop and Dreamweaver, you can transform the templates 
featured in this chapter into a Web site that best showcases your work. If you 
start working in this chapter and realize you still have a lot of work ahead of you 
to gather all the images, text, and other elements you need for your site, consider 
jumping to Chapter 2 and using the content check list and other resources to help 
you with the planning process.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Starting with Profile or Portfolio Templates
The instructions in this chapter are designed to be used with the templates and 
images provided on the Web site for this book (www.DigitalFamily.com/diy). 
You can choose a profile template or a portfolio template, depending on the type 
of site you want to create. To download a template, just check the Web site for 
this chapter number and template name listed in the Toolbox and then follow the 
simple instructions on the site to download the files. The step-by-step instructions 
in this chapter explain how to edit the template images as well as change colors, 
fonts, and other style options in the Web page templates.
If you’re new to working with Dreamweaver, you might want to first read Chapter 6 
to become familiar with the basics of working with Dreamweaver before you dive 
into creating a site with a template. If you know a little bit about Web design and 
you’re ready to customize one of the templates featured in this chapter, you find 
everything you need in the following pages.
Introducing the profile template
If you want to showcase your personal or professional experience, the profile tem­
plate is designed to make it easy to create a simple Web site that features your 
biography and samples of your work or hobbies in one quick and easy-to-design 
Web page. The first task in this chapter is the simplest of the template designs in 
this book. However, you can still alter the design as much or as little as you like, 
and you can always add more pages.
If you want to create a profile site with multiple pages, you can save copies of the 
page design and create links to as many pages as you need. If you know that you 
want to create a site with multiple sections, you may want to use the portfolio site 
template featured in the second half of this chapter because it’s already set up for 
a multiple page design, with a portfolio section that already includes a collection of 
linked pages. (See the next section for an introduction to the portfolio template.)
These are the templates and the main pages you get when you download the Profile 
template folder from www.DigitalFamily.com/diy:
	
✓	index.html is for the main Web page.
	
✓	banner-graphic.jpg is for the graphic banner that appears at the top of the 
page.
Figure 7-1 shows an example of a design created using the first template featured in 
this chapter. In the section “Designing a Winning Online Profile,” you find instruc­
tions for customizing the profile template text, banners, and other features. The 
site shown on the right, the freelance writer profile featured in this chapter, is an 
example of how you can customize the profile template.

131
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
Figure 7-1: You can create your own personalized version of the profile site by altering the colors, 
headlines, and text in this template.
Creating a multipage portfolio site
If you’re an artist, a photographer, a graphic designer, or another creative pro­
fessional, the portfolio site is for you! This template is designed to showcase a 
portfolio with an image gallery, and thus includes six main pages: one for the front 
page (shown in Figure 7-2), a second for an About page (which can also be used 
for a biography), and finally, four pages (one each) for the four galleries. The links 
among the main pages have already been created in the template files, making it 
easy to develop your own multipage site, like the one shown in the Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2: The Portfolio template is designed to showcase multiple image galleries, such as the 
collections of photographs in this example.
	
If you’re a photographer with hundreds or thousands of photos that you want to 
share online, you might be better served by one of the many photo-sharing sites 
on the Web (such as Flickr) or a professional photography site (such as Advanced 
Photo Websites at www.ifp3.com). You find a list of photo sites in the nearby side­
bar, “Many ways to share your photos.”

132
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Because the portfolio site is more complex than the profile site featured in the first 
part of this chapter, you find three separate tasks designed to help you fully cus­
tomize this site:
	
✓	The first task, in the section “Customizing Banner Graphics,” shows you 
how to edit the banner graphic (the image that appears at the top of this 
page design) using Photoshop Elements. However, you can edit the graph­
ics included with the template files in any image editor that supports Layers, 
including Adobe Photoshop. (Note: If you prefer to use text for the banner, you 
can simply delete the placeholder graphic at the top of the page and enter text 
in its place.)
	
✓	The second task, in the section “Customizing the Portfolio Home Page,” shows 
you how to use Dreamweaver to replace the text and images in these tem­
plates and how to make basic color and style changes.
	
✓	The third task, in the section “Creating and Linking Pages using the Gallery 
Templates,” covers how to create new pages from Dynamic Web Templates in 
Dreamweaver, set links to new pages, and use these templates to make global 
changes across the pages you create.
To help you get started and to make it easy for you to build a complete site quickly, 
I created five template pages for your portfolio site — one for each of the gallery 
pages and another for the front and about page designs. You can use these tem­
plates to generate as many pages as you like for the site. Because these templates 
use Dreamweaver’s Dynamic Web Template features, however, you will find restric­
tions on what can be altered in pages generated from the templates because some 
areas of the templates are locked, a feature that makes it possible to make global 
changes across all pages created from a template. You find detailed instructions on 
how to work with templates and locked regions in the tasks that follow.
To help you get started with this site and to ensure that the links on the naviga­
tion bars work properly, I created pages for each of the main sections from the 
templates. You can easily add or delete pages, change the number of galleries, and 
adjust the design to accommodate images of many different sizes.
These are the templates and the main pages you find in the site when you first 
download the template folder from www.DigitalFamily.com/diy:
	
✓	index.html is the home page of the site, which was not created with a 
template because it is a unique design. The home page is set up to display a 
banner image at the top of the page, a large main image in the middle, and four 
smaller images along the bottom, each linking to a different gallery.
	
✓	about.html is designed for a biography or other general information, but you 
can use it (or save copies of it) to create any page with images and text. It was 
created from the main.dwt template.
	
✓	photo1.html in the gallery1 folder is for the first page of the first gallery 
of the site and was created from the gallery1.dwt template. It’s set up to 
display a banner at the top of the page, a large main image, and eight smaller 
images along the bottom.
	
✓	photo1.html in the gallery2 folder is for the first page of the second gallery of 
the site and was created from the gallery2.dwt template. It’s set up like the 
first, but saved as a separate file so that you can alter each gallery independently.

133
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
	
✓	photo1.html in the gallery3 folder is for the first page of the third gallery of 
the site and was created from the gallery3.dwt template. Again set up like 
the first, but saved as a separate file so that you can alter it independently.
	
✓	photo1.html in the gallery4 folder is for the first page of the fourth gallery of 
the site and was created from the gallery4.dwt template. Again set up like 
the first, but saved as a separate file so that you can alter it independently.
	
Naming your files so that they correspond to their contents, as I have here, makes it 
easier to identify the pages later when you want to edit them.
Many ways to share your photos
You can find many excellent photo-sharing 
Web sites on the Internet, including the 
ones highlighted in this list:
Flickr: Flickr (www.flickr.com) is one the 
most sophisticated online photo sites, offer­
ing a wide range of services, including the 
ability to manage lots and lots of pictures 
in multiple personal albums. You also get 
more advanced options for adding captions 
and other text to your online album.
If you blog, you might appreciate the Flickr 
features that make it easy to add photos to a 
blog or online journal. You can even search 
through photos from other Flickr users and 
add their photos to your albums. (Sharing is 
optional: You can keep your albums private 
or make any or all of your images viewable 
by anyone who uses the site.)
Photobucket: You can manage large num­
bers of photos at Photobucket (www.photo
bucket.com) and also upload and share 
video. One feature that makes this site 
extremely popular is the ease with which 
you can add photos and videos that are 
hosted at Photobucket to your blog or your 
profile on sites like MySpace and Facebook.
Kodak EasyShare Gallery: The Kodak 
Gallery site (www.kodakgallery.com) is 
easy to use. You can upload photos you take 
using any digital camera, phone, or film; 
share your photos with friends, family, or 
whomever; and print your favorite pictures 
and shop for photo keepsakes and gifts, 
such as magnets, mugs, and coasters. Folks 
who look at your photos can sign a guest­
book so that you know they’ve been there.
Apple MobileMe: If you use an Apple 
Macintosh computer, you won’t find an 
easier way to share photos than iPhoto and 
MobileMe (www.apple.com/mobileme). 
With iPhoto, you can create photocasts to 
share any photo album with friends and 
family. When you use this free service, 
your photos are automatically uploaded 
to MobileMe, and your friends and family 
receive an e-mail message with a special 
link. When they click the link, they automat­
ically receive your photocast. Best of all, 
when you update your photos, your friends 
and family receive updates automatically.
Shutterfly: Similar to Kodak EasyShare 
Gallery, Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com) 
makes it easy to post and share photos 
for free, offers simple photo-editing tools, 
and sells printing services that you can 
use to create a variety of gift items and 
prints, including poster-size enlargements. 
Shutterfly has an intuitive interface, and 
you can use its specialized printing options 
to turn your pictures into greeting cards, 
bound photo albums, personalized calen­
dars, coffee mugs, T-shirts, and tote bags 
that you can send to your friends and family.
IFP3 Advanced Photo Websites: If you’re 
a professional photographer and want to 
create a Web site where you can sell photos 
online, consider a site like www.ifp3.com, 
designed to make it easy to upload and dis­
play photos as well as manage online sales.

134 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
You can edit the banner graphics used at both the top of the portfolio 
and profile templates by following the steps in this task. Change the 
colors and add your own text and images to make these banner graph­
ics work best for your Web site. You can edit these graphics in any 
image editor that supports Layers, including Adobe Photoshop and 
Photoshop Elements, which is used in this task. The process is nearly 
the same with either program in all the most recent versions. The pro­
file banner graphic, like all the other template images featured in this 
book, is designed with Layers to make it easy for you to customize the 
images, as you do in this task:
	1.	 Launch a graphics program, such as 
Photoshop Elements (shown here), and 
choose File➪Open to open one of the tem­
plate banners.
	2.	 In this example, I’m opening the Profile-
Banner.tif template image file. (You find 
this file in the images folder inside the 
Profile template folder that you download 
from the www.DigitalFamily.com/diy 
Web site.)

	5.	 With the Type tool active, click and 
drag to select a section of text and 
then type to replace the words. 
Adjust the Type tool settings on 
the Options bar at the top of the 
work area to change the color, font 
face, size, or other options. In this 
figure, I’m adjusting the font for the 
selected text, which I changed to 
read Jenny Hontz. If you don’t 
have the font I used in this tem­
plate, Photoshop may give you a 
warning that the font is missing, 
but it’s easy to fix. Just select any 
font available on your computer.
	4.	 To edit the text in any image 
in Photoshop or Photoshop 
Elements, first select the Type 
tool in the Toolbox.
	3.	 Open the Layers palette by choos­
ing Window➪Layers. The Layers 
palette displays the five layers in 
this banner image: one for the back­
ground, one for the text Profile 
Name, one for the smaller text that 
appears below the name, as well as 
layers that contain the colored bar 
and the bottom of the banner and 
the colored box that appears at the 
right. Because each section of text 
is on a separate layer, you can edit 
the text separately. For example, 
you can change the color of the 
words Profile Name without 
changing the color of the other text 
or affecting the background color.

136
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	7.	 If you have trouble selecting 
text in the image, you can 
click to select its layer in the 
Layers panel to make it active 
in the workspace.
	8.	 To change the background color of this 
image, first click to select the Move tool 
from the Toolbox, and then click in the 
Layers palette on the right side of the 
screen to select the Background layer. 
Choose Edit➪Fill to open the Fill Layer 
dialog box, choose Color from the Use 
drop-down list, and then select a new 
background color. To change the color of 
a section of an image, such as the blue bar 
at the bottom of this template image, first 
click the layer to make it active in the 
Layers panel. Then click to select the 
Marquee selection tool and use it to click 
and drag, selecting just the area you want 
to change before choosing Edit➪Fill and 
selecting a color.
	6.	 To reposition the text on the banner, click to 
select the Move tool from the Toolbox. (In 
Photoshop Elements, the Move tool is repre­
sented by the double-headed, crossed-arrow 
icon at the top of the Toolbox.) Then click and 
drag a section of text to adjust it. Note that if 
you click and drag a corner, you change the 
size of the text; if you click in the middle of a 
text area and drag, you move the text.

137
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
	11.	 After you make these changes to the 
banner image, choose File➪Save to 
save it before saving a copy that is 
optimized for the Web. To prepare 
any image for your Web pages, 
choose File➪Save for Web. In the 
Save for Web dialog box, choose 
JPEG or PNG-8 from the Optimized 
File Format drop-down list in the 
upper-right corner. The JPEG format 
is best for images that use millions 
of colors, such as photographs. If 
this banner had a solid background 
and only a few colors like this one, 
the GIF or PNG formats are better 
options. (You find details about the 
settings in the Save for Web dialog 
box in Chapter 5.)
	10.	Make sure the photo you want to add to your banner 
is the active image in the workspace; choose 
Select➪All to select the image, and choose Edit➪Copy 
to copy it. Then click anywhere on the banner image 
to make it the active image in the workspace; if an 
image isn’t visible in the workspace, you can make it 
active by clicking its thumbnail in the Project Bin at 
the bottom of the workspace or by choosing Window 
and then selecting the name of any open image listed 
at the bottom of the menu. With the image you want 
to add the photo to active, choose Edit➪Paste to 
insert the photo. The photo appears on a new layer. 
Select the layer, and click and drag to adjust the pho­
tograph’s placement on the banner.
	9.	 Each of the templates includes its 
own banner image, but you can 
mix and match them and you can 
add your own photos to any of 
them like this: First open both the 
photograph you want to add and 
the banner image from the tem­
plate folder (here you see the 
Portfolio banner from the Portfolio 
template). You can open as many 
images at once as your computer’s 
memory will allow by choosing 
File➪Open and selecting each 
image in turn from your hard drive.

138 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪New Site. In the 
Site Definition dialog box that appears, click the 
Advanced tab. In the Site Name text box, type a 
name for your site. In this example I’m creating 
for my journalist friend, Jenny, I entered Jenny 
Hontz Web Site. (For more detailed instruc­
tions on the site set-up process, see Chapter 6.)
	2.	 Click the Browse icon next to the Local Root 
Folder field. In the Choose Local Root Folder 
dialog box that appears, locate the folder on 
your hard drive that contains the profile tem­
plate you downloaded from www.Digital
Family.com/diy. (Note: The folder is named 
Profile-Template, but you can rename it, if you 
like.) Click Open and then click Select to select 
the folder and return to the Site Definition dialog 
box. Then click the Browse icon next to the 
Default Images Folder field and select the Images 
folder inside the profile template folder. Leave 
the rest of the options in this dialog box alone for 
now, and then click OK to close the Site Definition 
dialog box and save your settings. If you haven’t 
selected the Enable Cache check box, a message 
box appears, asking whether you want to create 
a cache for the site. Click Yes to speed up some 
of the Dreamweaver display features.

About half a day
When you have your images and content ready to go, you’re ready to 
download the profile template from the www.DigitalFamily.com/
diy Web site and get started. If you need help writing your own biogra­
phy, check out the nearby sidebar, “Telling your own tale.” Follow 
these steps to customize the template for your profile:

 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
Telling your own tale
Writing your own biography may seem 
like an easy task. After all, you’re arguably 
the best expert in the world on the topic of 
you. But if you sit down to write your own 
story and find that the words don’t come 
easily, rest assured that you’re not alone. 
Summing up your life in a few words or 
paragraphs can make the most experienced 
writers want to procrastinate with a run to 
the fridge for a little snack or the inexpli­
cable impulse to organize a desk or closet.
To help you get started, here are a few sug­
gestions for writing your own biography:
	✓	 Brainstorm a list of all accomplishments 
or key points that you want to include 
without worrying about writing them 
well or putting them in order. Then 
check each one off the list as you work it 
into your written biography.
	✓	 Ask friends or colleagues how they 
describe you and what they consider 
your best skills, and then use their ideas 
in your biography. This strategy is also 
a good way to get testimonials for your 
Web site.
	✓	 Decide whether you want to create a 
professional biography or a personal 
one. Then set the tone based on that 
decision. Consider your goals. When 
visitors to your Web site read your bio, 
do you want them to take you seriously, 
or do you want them to appreciate your 
creative vision? Do you want to focus on 
achievements or use humor to bring out 
your personality? Chapter 1 discusses in 
more detail how to plan goals for a site.
	✓	 Professional biographies are often writ­
ten in the third person (“she” rather than 
“you” or “I”) and in a more formal style. 
If you’re writing a professional biogra­
phy, imagine that an emcee will use it to 
introduce you before you give a speech 
to an audience who has never met you.
	✓	 Personal biographies can be much more 
informal, and are more likely to be written 
in the first person (“I” rather than “he” or 
“you”). In this case, you might imagine 
that you’re writing to a new penpal and 
introducing yourself for the first time.
	
	Remember that you can combine these 
two approaches, using the first person 
with a more formal style, for example, 
or using the third person with a sprinkle 
of humor and silliness.
	✓	 Start your biography with your most 
important accomplishment, a short list 
of skills or titles, or a brief anecdote that 
captures something important about 
who you are. Your goal is to give read­
ers a good sense of who you are or what 
you do even if they read only the first 
sentence or two.
When you’re finished, make sure to have 
someone you trust review your biography 
to make sure it reads well and covers the 
most important points before you add it to 
your Web site.

	5.	 To insert an image in the top of this 
design, click to select the graphic that 
reads My Profile and then click the 
Browse button (the yellow folder icon) 
for the Src field of the Property 
Inspector.
	4.	 Choose File➪Save As and name 
the page index.html. (See the 
sidebar “Creating new pages in 
a profile site” for details on why 
the main file of a site should be 
named index.) Then change 
the page title by replacing the 
text in the Title field, at the very 
top of the Dreamweaver work­
space. (Note: The page title isn’t 
displayed in the body of the 
Web page; this is the text that 
appears on the title bar at the 
top of the browser window.)

process, the files and folders in the 
profile template are displayed in 
the Files panel in Dreamweaver, to 
the side of the workspace. Double-
click the profile-template.

 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
	8.	 You can add more images by click­
ing to select any of the placeholder 
images and using the Browse 
button (the yellow folder icon) in 
the Property Inspector to replace 
an image. You can also add images 
by clicking to place your cursor 
where you want the image to 
appear, and then choosing 
Insert➪Image to insert any image. 
In this example, I’m adding a copy 
of the cover of a magazine from 
Jenny’s portfolio.
	7.	 If the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes 
dialog box opens, type a brief descrip­
tion of the image in the Alternate Text 
box. (This text will appear on the page if 
the image isn’t visible.) You can use the 
Long Description field to link to a longer 
description of the image in a separate 
file. Click OK when you’re done.
	6.	 In the Select Image Source dialog box that 
appears, navigate your hard drive to find the 
image you want to insert and then double-
click the image filename to select it. If the 
photo or other image you select in Step 6 
isn’t already located in the local root folder 
of your site, Dreamweaver offers to copy the 
file into the root folder. (You find more 
detailed instructions for adding images in 
Chapter 6.)

142
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	9.	 To align an image so that text wraps around 
next to it, click to select the image. Then, in 
the Property Inspector, use the Class drop-
down menu to select float-right or float-left 
to align the image. (Note: These are styles 
that I created when I created this template. 
You find similar styles with every template 
because aligning images and other elements 
to the left or right is a common option. These 
styles were created using the Float left and 
right options in CSS You find more about CSS 
in Chapters 4 and 6.)
	10.	To edit the text on the page, 
click and drag to select a head­
line or other section of text, and 
then type to replace it. Note 
that you can also use copy and 
paste to replace this text with 
text from another file, such as a 
word processing document.
	11.	It’s good practice to use CSS styles for all your 
formatting, especially if you use the same styl­
ing consistently, but if you just want to add a 
little formatting to a few words, you can use the 
formatting icons in the Property Inspector (at 
the bottom of the work area) to add bold, italic, 
and other formatting options. To remove bold 
or italic formatting, simply highlight the format­
ted text and then click the Bold or Italic button.

	14.	To change the colored stripe down 
the right side of this template 
design, you need to remove or 
replace the background image 
that is set in the style called 
#mainContent. The advantage of 
creating this stripe of color with a 
background image the way I did in 
this design is that it automatically 
adjusts to fill the column whether 
you have a little text or a lot of text 
in the other two columns on the 
page. To change the background 
image, double-click the style named 
#mainContent in the CSS Styles 
panel and then choose the 
Background category in the CSS 
Rule Definition dialog box.
	13.	This template includes CSS styles 
that control the font, color, and 
size of the text when you apply 
Heading sizes 1, 2, and 3. To 
change these options, in the 
CSS Styles panel (choose 
Window➪CSS to open it), double-
click to select the h1 or h2 style. 
The CSS Rule Definition dialog 
box appears, where you can edit 
the style settings, such as color 
and font face. You find more 
details on editing and creating 
styles in Chapters 4 and 6.
	12.	This template is designed with a set of head­
ing styles. If you want to add more headings 
or change the formatting of a heading, click 
and drag to select the text you want in your 
heading and then choose one of the Heading 
styles.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	15.	I included three different background images 
that you can choose from — background-
blue.png, background-red.png, and 
background-grey.png — but you can create 
your own background image using any color. 
(Tip: To ensure that the background fits this 
design, open the file background.tif in 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements and replace 
just the colored region in the image.)
	16.	To view how your page will 
appear in a Web browser, 
choose File➪Preview in 
Browser and select any 
browser you’ve associated 
with Dreamweaver. It’s always 
good practice to test your 
work in a variety of Web 
browsers. (You find instruc­
tions for previewing in differ­
ent Web browsers and adding 
browsers to Dreamweaver in 
Chapter 10.)
Creating new pages in a profile site
The main page of any Web site should be 
named index.html. (If you use a Windows 
server, you may need to change the name 
to default.html.) The rest of the pages 
can be named anything you like, as long as 
you don’t use spaces or special characters 
(hyphens [-] and underscores [_] are okay), 
and you include the .html extension at the 
end of every page. (Dreamweaver adds the 
extension for you automatically when you 
create and save pages in Dreamweaver.)
You can create new or additional pages 
for your site from the profile template fea­
tured in this chapter by simply choosing 
File➪Save As and giving the file a new 
name. (Just be sure that you don’t delete 
the extension.)

145
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
After you edit the image that will appear at the top of your page design, 
you’re ready to start working on the template by adding your own text 
and images to make the site your own. If you followed the planning 
steps in Chapter 1, think of this step as the one where you get to add all 
the content you collected at the beginning of this book. If you skipped 
that chapter, don’t worry: You just have to do more preparation to get 
your own content ready before you can follow all the steps in this 
section.
The portfolio template created for this chapter is made up of several 
pages, including five template files that can be used to generate addi­
tional pages. The template files are saved in the Templates folder, 
which is inside the main Portfolio Template folder. These template files 
are special because they use the Dreamweaver Dynamic Web Template 
features, which is why the filenames end in .dwt rather than .html, 
like the other pages in this site. One of the biggest benefits of using 
Dynamic Web Templates (as you see in the following steps) is that 
when you make a change to a template file and then save it, that change 
is automatically applied to all pages in the Web site that were created 
from the template file. You find instructions for how to create and edit 
templates like these in Chapter 6.
In this task, you find instructions for editing the portfolio template files 
to add the banner image to all pages in this site, as well as how to edit 
the front page of the site. To set up your portfolio site in Dreamweaver 
and edit the home page, follow these steps:
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪
New Site. In the Site Definition dialog 
box that appears, click the Advanced 
tab. In the Site Name text box, type a 
name for your site. In this example, I 
entered Jasper Johal Photography.

	4.	 In the New Document dialog box 
that appears, choose Page from 
Template from the far left. Then 
choose main from the list of tem­
plates. A preview of the template 
is displayed in the far right of the 
dialog box window. Click Create 
to create a new page using the 
selected template.
	3.	 After you complete the site setup process, 
the files and folders in the template are dis­
played in the Files panel in Dreamweaver, to 
the side of the workspace. To open a folder 
in the Files panel and display its contents, 
click the plus (+) sign to the left of the folder. 
In this figure, you can see five templates in 
the Templates folder. To create the first 
page in this template site, choose File➪New 
to open the New Document dialog box.
	2.	 Click the Browse icon next to the Local Root Folder text 
box and locate the folder on your hard drive that con­
tains the portfolio template files you downloaded from 
www.DigitalFamily.com/diy. Then click the Browse 
icon next to the Default Images Folder field and select 
the Images folder. Leave the rest of the options in this 
dialog box alone for now, and then click OK to close the 
Site Definition dialog box and save your settings. If you 
haven’t selected the Enable Cache option, a message 
box appears, asking whether you want to create a cache 
for the site. Click Yes to speed up some of the 
Dreamweaver display features. (For more detailed 
instructions on the site setup process, see Chapter 6.)

147
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
	5.	 You can replace any of the images 
in this page design except the 
banner. Just double-click the gray 
box that serves as an image place­
holder for the image; in the Select 
Image Source dialog box, click to 
select the image you want to use in 
its place. (If you use this method, 
be sure to then click to select the 
image; then, in the Property 
Inspector at the bottom of the 
page, change the text in the Alt field 
by deleting the word Photo and 
typing in a text description of your 
image.) For the best results, insert 
images that are the height and 
width specified in the image place­
holders so that they fit within this 
Web page design. If you want to use 
larger images, you may need to 
change the width settings in the 
corresponding styles. See Chapter 5 
for help resizing and optimizing 
images for the Web.
	6.	 Repeat Step 5 until you replace or 
delete all the images except the 
banner. (Don’t worry: You’ll get to 
the banner soon.) If you don’t want 
to use images in all three boxes, 
you can delete any of the image 
placeholders by first clicking to 
select the image and then pressing 
the Delete or Backspace key on 
your keyboard. Then simply enter 
any other image or text in its place. 
Note that when an image is 
selected, the options for that image 
appear in the Property Inspector.

148
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	8.	 To change the banner image in the 
template, first open the template 
file named main.dwt, which is 
saved in the Templates folder. You 
can open a template file like you 
would open any other page in 
Dreamweaver, by double-clicking 
its name in the Files panel or by 
choosing File➪Open and selecting 
the file.
	7.	 If you try to select the banner image at 
the top of any page created from a tem­
plate like this, you may be frustrated 
that you can’t edit it in a page created 
from the template, such as this 
index.html file. That’s because it’s in 
a locked region and can be changed 
only in the template file. You can tell 
the difference between locked and 
unlocked regions because when you 
click anything in a locked region, the 
cursor changes to a circle with a line 
through it — the universal symbol 
for “You can’t do that.” Among the 
many benefits of locking a region, 
such as this banner, in a template in 
Dreamweaver is that when you edit the 
banner in the template file, you can 
automatically update all the pages cre­
ated from that template.

149
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
	9.	 With the template file open, you 
can change the banner image at the 
top of the page by double-clicking 
the banner image and then using 
the Select Image Source dialog box 
to select the image you want to use 
in its place. In this case, I replaced 
the placeholder image with the 
template banner that I customized 
in the first task in this chapter, 
“Customizing the Banner Graphics.” 
(Remember that you should click 
to select the image after it’s 
inserted and then enter a text 
description of the image in the Alt 
field in the Property Inspector.)
	10.	When you save the template file with the 
new banner, Dreamweaver launches the 
Update Template Files dialog box with a 
list of all files created with the open tem­
plate. In this case, only the index page 
was created from this template, so it’s 
the only one listed. To apply this change 
to the index page, click the Update button. 
If the template had been used to create 
many pages, this process would update all 
pages created from the ­template — a 
useful time-saver when you’re working 
with many similar files, such as the gallery 
sections of this Web site.

150 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
The Portfolio template features four Dynamic Web Template files that 
can be used to generate additional pages. I’ve given you four gallery 
templates, and you can create as many as you need to manage as many 
galleries as you want to feature in your site. In this task, you create new 
pages from the gallery1 template and make global changes to the 
pages in the first gallery by editing the gallery1 template file.
Because the gallery pages in this Web site include many thumbnail 
images that are repeated on every page of the gallery, this is an ideal 
use for templates. I find it simplest to start by creating all the gallery 
pages from the gallery1 template and inserting the big image (the 
only image that changes from page to page). Then I go back and insert 
the corresponding thumbnails and set the links in the gallery file itself 
because it’s always easier to set a link when you already have pages 
created to link to. The thumbnails in these gallery pages are intention­
ally saved in a region that can be edited only in the template itself so 
that you add them all just once in the template, and they automatically 
update in all the pages created from the gallery. You see how this works 
in the following task.
Before you can complete this task, you must complete the site setup 
process to load this entire template folder into Dreamweaver. If you 
completed the preceding task, “Customizing the Portfolio Home Page,” 
you should be ready to go; if not, you first need to complete Steps 1–3 
in the previous task. (For more detailed instructions on the site set-up 
process, see Chapter 6.)
	1.	 Start by creating a new page from 
the gallery1.dwt template by 
choosing File➪New. In the New 
Document dialog box that appears, 
choose Page from Template from 
the far left. Then choose gallery1 
from the list of templates. A preview 
of the template is displayed in the 
far right of the dialog box. Note this 
template is designed to create a 
gallery with eight thumbnail images 
and one large image in the main 
area of the page, but you can alter 
the design by adding or removing 
image placeholders or by replacing 
them with images of different sizes. 
Click Create to create a new page 
using the selected template.

	3.	 To replace the image placeholder 
in the middle of the page with a 
photograph, double-click to select 
the placeholder image. Then, in the 
Select Image Source dialog box, 
click to select a photograph to 
insert into the page in its place. 
Click to select the image after it’s 
inserted and enter a text descrip­
tion of the image in the Alt field in 
the Property Inspector. To add a 
caption, click to place your cursor 
beneath the photo and then type to 
enter text. (Don’t worry about the 
banner image at the top of the page 
or the thumbnail images across the 
bottom. You replace those images 
in Step 5.)
	2.	 Keep each collection of gallery 
pages in a separate folder so you 
don’t have to worry about dupli­
cate file names. In this example, I 
created a new folder called gallery1 
and saved the file with the name 
photo1.html. (You can create a 
new folder similar to how you save 
a file in Dreamweaver: Clicking the 
New folder icon in the Save As 
dialog box.)
	
Add a unique title to the top of each page as you create it by replacing the text in the Title field at the very top 
of the page. Using specific titles with keywords can improve search engine results for pages in your site.

152
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	4.	 To create additional pages for the 
gallery, repeat Steps 1–3, saving all 
the files in each gallery with a new 
name, such as photo2.html, 
photo3.html, and so on in the 
same gallery1 folder. In this site for 
Jasper, I used eight thumbnails and 
eight pages in each gallery. If you 
use eight images the same size as 
the ones I used, you can use this 
template exactly as I created it. If 
you delete or add images, or if you 
change the sizes, you may need to 
make adjustments to the designs in 
the CSS. (You learn more about 
editing CSS and templates in 
Chapters 4 and 6.)
	5.	 In the gallery templates, the banner 
graphic is in a locked region at the 
top of the template, and the thumb­
nails and copyright information are 
in a locked region at the bottom. To 
edit these images, first open the 
gallery1.dwt file, located in the 
Templates folder. Replacing the 
banner at the top of all these gallery 
pages is easy. Double-click the place­
holder image at the top and select the 
banner image you created for your 
site. (Find instructions for customizing 
a banner image in the first task in this 
chapter.) After I add the banner image 
to the template, I choose File➪Save to 
save the template, and Dreamweaver 
prompts me to update only the eight 
pages I created with this template.

153
 Chapter 7: Creating a Profile or Portfolio Site
	7.	 Link each thumbnail image to its 
corresponding page by first clicking 
to select the thumbnail image in 
the page and then choosing 
Insert➪Hyperlink; or, click the 
Browse button (the yellow folder 
icon) next to the Link field in the 
Property Inspector. In the Select 
File dialog box that appears, click 
to select the page you want to link 
the thumbnail image to, and then 
click OK to set the link. Repeat this 
step for each thumbnail. After I add 
and link all the thumbnails, I save 
the page again, and again click 
Update in the Update Template files 
dialog box to add the thumbnails to 
all the pages.
	6.	 Adding and linking all the thumb­
nail images at the bottom of each 
gallery template will take a little 
time, but it works the same 
whether you’re adding four thumb­
nail images to the home page 
design or eight to each of the gal­
lery templates. Because you’re 
adding the thumbnails images and 
links to the template, Dreamweaver 
will add them to all the pages in 
your galleries automatically, saving 
you having to set all those links 
multiple times, and making it easy 
to add or remove images to all the 
pages later. To replace each thumb­
nail, double-click the placeholder 
image in the template and select 
an image sized to fit this template 
design and saved in the PNG or 
JPEG format. (You find instructions 
for resizing and optimizing images 
before you insert them into a tem­
plate in Chapter 5.)

154
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	10.	To test the links on each thumb­
nail, preview the page in a Web 
browser by clicking on the 
Browser icon at the top of the 
workspace or by choosing 
File➪Preview in Browser and then 
selecting a browser. Clicking the 
each thumbnail in turn across the 
bottom of the gallery and each 
thumbnail should link you to the 
next page in the sequence. If you 
find that you missed one or need 
to fix a link, just open the file 
again in Dreamweaver, click the 
graphic, and re-create the link as 
you did in Step 7.
	9.	 Click each thumbnail image in 
turn to make sure that you set 
the links properly. If you find one 
that doesn’t link to the correct 
page, open the template again in 
Dreamweaver and correct the link 
in the template. When you save 
the template, the corrected link 
will be updated in all related gal­
lery pages.
	8.	 To test the links, double-click to open the 
photo1.html page in the gallery1 folder. 
Choose any of the pages you created in the 
gallery1 folder, click the Preview in Browser 
icon at the top of the workspace (it looks like 
a globe), and then choose the browser you 
want to use to test the page. You can also 
choose File➪Preview in Browser and then 
select a browser.

Chapter 8
Creating a Business Web Site
O
nce in a while, I still meet small-business owners who ask, 
“Do I really need to have a Web site?” Today, the answer 
is easy: “Yes.” And, increasingly, the owners of even the smallest 
businesses have caught on to the many advantages of creating, or 
extending, their business online: Creating a site for a business can 
help sell more of its products, attract more customers, and better 
serve the existing customers. 
Whether you’re creating a site for the first time or redesigning 
a site, you can customize the templates featured in this book to 
create nearly any kind of Web site, whether you want a site for 
your carpentry business, law firm, photography studio, or nearly 
anything else you can imagine promoting online. 
In this chapter, you walk through the steps of customizing templates designed to 
meet the needs of many small businesses. 
Introducing the Business Site Templates
Although every business is different, most good business Web sites have some 
things in common: basic information about the business or service, photos, sample 
work, contact information, and so on. A testimonials page is another good idea 
for any business, such as the one my friend, actor Yuval David, features on his 
site, shown in Figure 8-1. By altering the template used in this chapter (shown in 
Figure 8-2), you can create a site for your own business with all these features and 
a design as professional-looking as Yuval’s.

Figure 8-2: This template can be altered to create a site for many kinds of businesses

157
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
By altering the names of the sections in this template, you can quickly create a simi­
lar Web site that fits the needs of your Web project, and you can use the template 
to create new pages and build a bigger Web site, like I did for my friend’s acting 
site, which includes videos, photo galleries, and other special sections. (You can 
download all the templates featured in this book from the companion Web site at 
www.DigitalFamily.com/diy.)
The Business Template, included with this chapter, comprises the following files:
	
✓	images: All your template image files are in this folder, in TIFF format. These 
image files include layers, which makes it easy to edit them in a program like 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements. You also find in this folder optimized JPEG 
files that you can use if you want to practice as you go through these tasks. 
(You learn more about resizing and optimizing your own images for the Web in 
Chapter 5.)
	
✓	index.html: The main page of any Web site should be named index. You can 
alter the basic template design to use multiple images or to include more text, 
but it’s always good to include a clear description of what your site is about on 
the home page.
	
✓	about.html: This is a good place to include a description of your business, 
your biography, or other background information. A larger business can 
expand this into a series of pages that make up a Who We Are section for staff, 
executives, board of directors, and so on.
	
✓	news.html: The news or press section can feature your latest activities. You 
can even link to a blog. You find out how to set up a blog in Chapter 11.
	
✓	work.html: This section can include videos, case studies, articles you’ve writ­
ten, or other samples of your work.
	
✓	gallery.html: List additional information or create a new section of your 
site, such as a listing of products, services, or photos.
	
✓	contact.html: Making it easy for customers to reach you is always good, but 
be careful about giving away too much information on your Web site. If you 
work at home, for example, you may want to leave off your street address and 
just include an e-mail address on your contact page. Figure 8-3 shows a contact 
page.
You also find subfolders in this Business template. The images folder contains the 
starter image for the banner for this site and is a good place for you to save any 
new images you want to add to the site. You also find the Templates folder, which 
is where Dreamweaver saves the Template file that goes with these page designs. 
(Flip to Chapter 6 for a refresher on Dreamweaver template files.)
	
If you want to rename any of the files or folders in this template site, be sure to do so 
in the Dreamweaver Files panel to ensure that Dreamweaver automatically adjusts 
the links that correspond to the files. You can add pages to the Business template 
site by following the instructions in the section “Creating and Editing Pages with a 
Web Template in Dreamweaver,” later in this chapter.

Figure 8-3: You can change these template pages a little or a lot to create more dramatic pages, 
such as this contact page with a long background image.

159
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
I generally start my design work in a program like Photoshop and rec­
ommend you prepare at least some of your images in a program like 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements before you start working on the tem­
plates in Dreamweaver. 
To help you get your images ready for this business site, I included 
three starter images: one for the banner, one that can serve as a photo 
frame, and one for the home page. These graphics files are composed of 
different layers, each containing a separate element in the design, so 
you can change the text, colors, and even add more photos. I’ve included 
all the starter images in the images folder so all you have to do is add 
your own text and photos. 
In this task, I use Photoshop Elements to transform the starter images 
into the images for the actor site, but you can follow these same steps 
in whatever program you prefer (or have handy), including Photoshop, 
Photoshop Elements, or Fireworks. After you prepare each image, you 
use the Save for Web option to optimize them for the Web. (You find 
more about creating and optimizing images for the Web in Chapter 5.)
	1.	 Launch a graphics program, 
such as Photoshop or 
Photoshop Elements (shown

Editing and Sizing Images for the Template
Time needed:
About an hour

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	
If the image you’re adding to a template is significantly larger than the template file, resize the new image 
before you copy and paste it into the template image. The image size for each image is displayed in the tem­
plate. You can change the resolution and dimensions of an image by choosing Image➪Size and adjusting the 
settings. You can make minor changes to the size of an image by clicking and dragging any corner of an image 
after it’s inserted into the template image. (You can find more detailed instructions for resizing and optimizing 
images in Chapter 5.)
	2.	 You can copy and paste images into 
this template by choosing File➪
Open and selecting any image from 
your hard drive. In this example, 
I opened a photo of Yuval, which I 
want to use in the banner at the top 
of his page. To copy an image into 
the template, first choose Select➪
All to select the image and then 
choose File➪Copy to copy it. Click 
anywhere on the template image 
to make it active in the workspace. 
(If the template image is hidden by 
the new image, choose Window➪
Banner-Template.tif to bring the 
template to the front of the work­
space before you paste.) Choose 
File➪Paste to insert the new image 
into the template.
	3.	 After you paste an image, like this photo, you can click 
anywhere within the image and drag to adjust its place­
ment. You can also click and drag a corner to adjust the 
size of the image. And here’s an advanced Photoshop tip 
(that also works in Elements): If you hold your cursor 
just outside the corner of an image, the arrow becomes 
curved like the one in this figure, indicating that you can 
rotate the image, to set it off at an angle, as I’ve done to 
position this photo in its frame. You can also rotate an 
image by choosing Edit➪Transform➪Rotate.

161
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
	4.	 To edit the text, select the Text tool 
from the Toolbox. Then click and 
drag to select the text and type to 
replace it. Use the options at the top 
of the workspace to change the font, 
size, and color. In this example, 
I clicked the color well at the top of 
the page to change the text color. 
Tip: To reposition text on the page, 
click to select the Move tool from 
the Toolbox. (In Photoshop, the 
Move tool is represented by the 
double-headed crossed arrow icon 
at the top of the Toolbox.) Then 
click and drag any section of text. 
	5.	 When you’re done customizing the 
banner image for your Web page, 
choose File➪Save for Web and use 
the settings to optimize the image. 
In this case, because the banner 
includes a photo, I’m saving it as a 
JPEG. (You find more about the 
options for optimizing images in 
Chapter 5.)

162
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	7.	 Because this site is for an actor, I thought it would be 
fun to use a frame around the photos that makes 
them look like they’re stills in a film strip. I start by 
adding the filmstrip image to serve as the 
background.
	6.	 You can insert images of many 
different sizes into the templates 
in this business site and align 
them to the left or right so that 
text can wrap around them. To 
dress up your images, you can 
use a background as a frame. I’ve 
included a starter image called 
Photo-Frame-Template.tif 
in the images folder for you.

163
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
	9.	 With a photo like this positioned above a 
background image, like this filmstrip, you 
can use the Move tool to click and drag the 
image into position, change the size, and 
adjust the alignment until you get it framed 
just the way you want it.
	10.	When you have everything set 
the way you want it, choose 
File➪Save for Web to optimize 
the image as a JPEG or PNG file. 
(You find more about the 
options for optimizing images in 
Chapter 5.) 
	8.	 When you layer images like this, make sure 
the right image is on top in the Layers panel, 
because that controls how the final image 
looks. In this case, I need to make sure the 
image with the photo is above the back­
ground image with the filmstrip.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	11.	You can create images as large as 
you want. Just beware that the 
more you put on a Web page, the 
longer it takes to download. If 
you’re going to create a page like 
the home page design my friend 
Davi Cheng created for Yuval’s 
acting site, you need to limit what 
else you put on the page. If you’re 
going to use a large image on a 
page, that’s probably all you should 
put on that page. In this case, I 
created one, big layered image by 
copying in each image (and crop­
ping out the main photo).
	12.	Even large, layered images like 
this one can be optimized for 
the Web so that they load fairly 
quickly. Because this is the only 
image I’m placing on the home 
page of his site, it should load 
quickly at only 84K in size.
	
When you use the Save for Web dialog box, you create a copy of the image in its new, optimized format. As a 
result, after you close the Save for Web dialog box, the original image remains open and unchanged in 
Photoshop Elements.

 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
In this task, you set up a new Web site using the Business template and 
start customizing the pages.
As you work through the following steps, remember that you can alter 
this template a little (by simply adding your own text and images) or a 
lot (by changing the colors, font options, and other style settings) to 
make the design more your own. Also notice that by using a large photo 
on the home page and a smaller, banner photo on the inside pages, I 
can create a very different look for the home page with the same tem­
plate I use for the inside pages.
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪New Site. In the Site Definition dialog box, click the 
Advanced tab. In the Site Name text box, type a name for your site. In this exam­
ple, I entered Business Site Template. Click the Browse icon next to the Local 
Root Folder text box and locate on your hard drive the folder that contains the 
Business template files. (Note: You can rename the folder.) Click the Browse icon 
next to the Default Images folder field and select the Images folder in the Business 
template folder. Then click OK. If you haven’t yet selected the Enable Cache 
option, a message box appears, asking whether you want to create a cache for the 
site. Click Yes to speed up some of the Dreamweaver display features. (For more 
detailed instructions on the site setup process, see Chapter 6.)

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 When you complete the site setup 
process, the files and folders in the 
template are displayed in the Files 
panel in Dreamweaver, at the side 
of the workspace. Double-click 
the index.html file in the Files 
panel to open the home page in 
Dreamweaver. 
	3.	 At the top of the home page, you can change the page 
title, as I’m doing here, by replacing the text in the Title 
field. Enter your name or business name or a brief 
description to identify your site, such as I did in this 
example, with the words Official Site of Actor Yuval 
David. The page title is the text that appears in the title 
bar at the top of the browser window when someone 
views a page online; this text is saved in a list of sites if 
someone bookmarks the page. 
	4.	 You can replace any of the image 
placeholders with images you pre­
pared for your site. To insert an 
image, double-click any image, such 
as the banner at the top to open the 
Select Image Source dialog box. 
Navigate on your hard drive to find 
the image you want to insert and 
then double-click the image file­
name to select it. As you see in this 
example, I’m inserting the home 
page image I created and optimized 
in the previous task. If the image 
you select isn’t already located in 
your root site, Dreamweaver offers 
to copy the file into the root folder 
after you select it. 

167
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
	5.	 The way this template is made, the 
design expands to fit images of 
any height, but the width should 
not exceed the overall width of 
this design, which is set to 970 
pixels wide. Because this home 
page is just one big image, it’s one 
of the easiest pages to create in 
Dreamweaver. Simply delete any 
text you don’t want in the template 
and save the page. (Remember, the 
home page should always be 
named index.html.) 
	6.	 On the rest of the pages in this site, I use 
a smaller banner image at the top of the 
template to leave room for text and images 
I want to include on these pages. This tem­
plate is set up to let you use a different 
banner on each page, which enabled me to 
use different photos of Yuval throughout the 
site, but you can use just one banner if you 
prefer.
	
The links in all the pages in this Business template can be changed only in the template file used to create these 
pages. That makes it possible to set the main links on all the pages at once, as you do in the next task.

168
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	7.	 You can add text by typing it 
into any part of the page, but 
be careful not to delete the 
formatting when you delete 
the Latin (Lorem ipsum) text, 
which is included as filler in 
the template. If you have 
trouble adding text without 
altering the format, use Undo 
(Ctrl+Z on Windows, or Ô+Z 
on Mac) to back up a step 
and try again, making sure to 
select just what you want to 
replace on the page. 
	8.	 You can insert images anywhere in 
the main area of the template by 
clicking to place your cursor where 
you want the image to appear and 
then choosing Insert➪Image. You 
can align images to the left or right 
of a page and wrap text by using 
the class styles, float-left and float-
right, included with this template. 
First click to select the image; then 
use the Class drop-down list in the 
Property Inspector to select the 
alignment option you want for your 
image.

169
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
	9.	 To change the text size or color in 
these templates, you need to edit 
the style that controls the ele­
ments. To do so, open the CSS 
Styles panel (if it’s not open 
already) by choosing Window➪
CSS Styles. In this template, to 
change the style of the headlines, 
you need to change the corre­
sponding styles I’ve defined for 
Heading tags 1 and 2. The h1 is the 
largest heading style; h2 provides a 
second-level heading. To change 
the Heading 1 style, double-click 
the h1 option in the CSS Styles 
panel, and change the text settings 
in the CSS Rule Definition dialog 
box. Click OK when you’re done 
to return to the Dreamweaver 
workspace.
	10.	To apply the heading styles to text in the 
page, select the text and then use the 
Format drop-down list in the Property 
Inspector to choose a Heading size.
	11.	To change the layout of the page, you need 
to change other styles, such as the width of 
the style named #container, which con­
trols the overall width of the page in this 
template. You can double-click the name of a 
style in the CSS Styles panel to open the style 
in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and edit 
it there. Or make changes in the lower half of 
the CSS Styles panel as you see in this figure.

170
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	12.	You can change the layout dra­
matically from page to page 
using the same template in a 
Web site simply by using images 
in different sizes and aligning 
them differently on the page. In 
this example, I’m adding a big 
image with three separate 
photos to fill most of the width 
of the page. 
	13.	To test your work in a Web 
browser, choose File➪Preview in 
Browser and select any browser on 
your hard drive. For best results, 
test your work in a variety of Web 
browsers to ensure that your pages’ 
designs look good for all visitors. In 
this figure, the page is displayed in 
Internet Explorer. For more instruc­
tions on working with CSS, see 
Chapter 6. For instructions on how 
to upload your site to a Web server, 
see Chapter 10.
	
You can change the width of the page, but I’ve designed this template to be 970 pixels wide because that size is 
a good width if you’re designing for a screen resolution of 1024 x 768, a common resolution on 15- and 17-inch 
monitors, considered the most common in use on the Web today.

171
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
As described in the previous task, you can add your own images and 
text to the pages of the Business template to create a variety of differ­
ent looks for your site. When it comes to editing the main links and 
copyright information that appear on every page, however, you need to 
change those in the template file itself. Although this requirement may 
seem limiting at first, the benefit is that you edit these links in only one 
place to update the main navigation links on all the pages in the site.
Dreamweaver templates are designed so that some regions of the page 
can be edited in pages created from the template, and other regions can 
be edited only in the template itself. The navigation links that appear 
above the banner in this template and again at the bottom of the page 
with the copyright information can be edited only in the template. 
In this task, you make global changes to pages by editing the template 
file, and you create new pages from a Dreamweaver Web Template. 
Before you can complete this task, you must complete the site setup 
process in Dreamweaver, covered at the beginning of the preceding 
task.
	1.	 To give you a head start on this Web site 
design, the Business template folder has several 
pages that are already linked together. You can 
edit any of these pages, such as the work.html 
page, by simply double-clicking the name in the 
Files panel to open it. It’s common practice to 
include a page on your Web site that showcases 
what you do, like you see in this figure, and it’s 
easy to add images, text, and even video files to 
this page that was created from the template. 
	2.	 If you try to click the links or the copyright 
information on the work.html page or any of 
the other HTML pages that were created from 
this template, your cursor turns into a circle 
with a line through it, and you can’t make any 
changes in the HTML file. To edit this part of 
the page, you need to open the template.

Web Template in Dreamweaver
Time needed:
About half a day

172
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	3.	 To edit the template itself, double-click the 
name in the Files panel. In this Business tem­
plate site, the template is called Business-
Template.dwt and it’s in the Templates 
folder.
	4.	 You can edit anything in the tem­
plate file, but you should do it care­
fully so as not to disturb the 
formatting and links that surround 
the text. For example, to change 
the name of a section (at the top or 
bottom of the page), click to select 
the section of text, such as About 
Us, and replace it by typing the text 
you want to in its place. In this 
example, I changed About Us to 
Biography. As you can see in the 
Property Inspector at the bottom 
of the screen, when the text is 
selected, the link is displayed in the 
Link field. To change or reset the 
link, click the Browse button (it 
looks like a little yellow folder) next 
to the Link field in the Property 
Inspector.
	5.	 To apply a change in the template to all the 
pages created from the template, just save 
the template file and Dreamweaver prompts 
you with a dialog box that lists all the pages 
that will be updated. Click Update to com­
plete the changes.

173
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
	6.	 Changing the text links doesn’t alter the file­
names, but you can change those as well by 
clicking to select the name of a file in the Files 
panel and typing to replace the name. Change 
file or folder names only in the Files panel to 
ensure that Dreamweaver updates any links 
that go to that page. As you see here, when I 
changed the about.html page to bio.html, 
Dreamweaver prompted me with another 
update dialog box listing all the pages that link 
to the about.html page. Remember: Folder 
and filenames used in Web sites shouldn’t 
include spaces or special characters except 
the dash (–).
	7.	 To add a new page to this Web 
site by using the template, 
choose File➪New. Then, in the 
New Document dialog box, 
choose Page from Template 
(from the options on the left), 
make sure that the Web site 
you’re working on is selected in 
the middle column, and choose 
Business-Template from the 
right column. (Notice that a pre­
view of the selected template is 
displayed on the far right side of 
this dialog box.) Click Create to 
generate a page from the 
template.
	8.	 Before you do anything else, always save the new 
page by choosing File➪Save and name the page as 
you save it. I named this page videos.html. You 
can then change the page title (the text that appears 
in the title bar of a Web browser window) by click­
ing to select the text at the top of the workspace 
and typing in any title you choose. In this case, 
I entered Actor Yuval David’s Videos.

174
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	9.	 Like all the other pages created 
from this template, you can replace 
the text and image placeholders 
with your own text, images, and 
even multimedia files. In this exam­
ple, I’ve added code from the 
Vimeo video hosting service to 
insert a video into this page. You 
find out more about how to use 
video services, such as YouTube 
and Vimeo, in Chapter 13.
	10.	To play multimedia, such as this 
video file, you need to preview 
your page in a Web browser by 
choosing File➪Preview in Browser 
and selecting a Web browser, 
such as Firefox. With a page open 
in a browser, you can click the 
links to test your work and play 
videos and other multimedia files.
	
Many Web browsers don’t display Dreamweaver Web Templates well, so if you try to preview the .dwt tem­
plate page, you may get an error message. To test any changes you make to a template, open one of the pages 
created from the template and then preview that page in a browser and test the links and other features.

175
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
Whether you’re working with one of the templates included in this book 
or you want to dress up a page you create with your own custom 
design, using background images can provide a great short cut to creat­
ing a distinct, professional-looking site — even if you’re not a profes­
sional designer.
The best part about this trick is that you can find so much great art­
work on stock image sites like www.istockphoto.com, where I got the 
filmstrip background image for the site. Web sites like iStockphoto.com 
license the rights to images, often with some restrictions. For example, 
for a few dollars, I bought the right to use this background image in a 
Web site and even feature images of that Web site in this book. If you 
want to use this image, or another image from iStockphoto.com, you 
have to buy the rights to the image for your own site. The good news is 
that you can choose from millions of photographs and illustrations on 
stock image sites and the licensing fee is a small price to pay for the 
professional look you get from a well-designed background. With a little 
creativity, you can create your own background images in a program 
like Photoshop or Photoshop Elements (see Chapter 5 for more on cre­
ating your own images).
	1.	 Stock image Web sites, like www.
istockphoto.com shown here, 
offer rights to photographs, illus­
trations, flash videos, and anima­
tions. You can search among many 
different keywords and when you 
find an image, you simply click to 
download. Most reputable sites 
that offer good quality images do 
charge for the service, but sites like 
iStockphoto offer images for as 
little as $1 each.

Stuff You 
Need to Know
Using Background Images in Page Layouts
Time needed:
About half a day
	
When you’re designing for the Web, you don’t usually need a big, high-resolution image (the higher the resolu­
tion, they more expensive it is), but you do need to make sure you get a big enough version that it will fill the 
entire background of your page. Because most designers are creating sites for a 1024 x 768 monitor these days, 
the image should be at least 1024 pixels wide. You can always reduce the size of an image, but enlarging it can 
lead to a loss of quality.

176
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 After you’ve created or downloaded 
an image to serve as the back­
ground of your Web page, you can 
combine it with other images and 
text in a program like Photoshop 
Elements, shown here. In this exam­
ple, by placing the big image behind 
the text I was able to create a lay­
ered effect. You should edit and 
resize your background image and 
then use the Save for Web dialog 
box to save an optimized version 
for your Web site.
	3.	 You can add any image to the background 
of the entire page by choosing 
Modify➪Page Properties and using the 
Browse button next to the Background 
Image field to select the image.
	4.	 Another way to use background 
images is in the background of a 
<div> tag in your page layout. In all 
the templates featured in this book, 
the designs are centered and they 
float on the screen so that they 
appear in the middle of the browser 
window no matter how big or small 
the monitor. If you use one of my 
templates, or create your own cen­
tered design like the one featured 
in this example, your best bet is to 
add the background image to the 
main div, in this case the <div> 
tag named #container that sur­
rounds all the other content on this 
page. To do so, double-click the 
#container style in the CSS Styles 
panel; in the CSS Rule Definition 
dialog box that appears, choose 
the Background category and then 
click Browse button to the right of 
the Background field and select 
your desired background image file.

177
 Chapter 8: Creating a Business Web Site
	5.	 To view the full impact of your 
background image, preview your 
page in different Web browsers and 
try out the design on large and 
smalls screens to make sure it dis­
plays well on a variety of comput­
ers. Chapter 10 explains site testing 
in more detail.
	6.	 After you’ve set up a background 
image for one page, it’s easy to use 
the same design for any or all of 
the other pages in your site as well. 
When you add an image to the 
background of the page, you can 
add other images, text, or even 
multimedia files above the back­
ground to create a layered effect 
that can create a rich, full design 
effect.

Creating a Family, Vacation, 
or Hobby Site
T
here are many excellent reasons to create a Web site, slide 
show, or photo gallery. From the announcement of a new 
baby to sharing the latest vacation snapshots to coordinating the 
games for your little league team, digital designs are a great way to 
keep in touch with family and friends.
The best family sites include room for everyone in the clan, and 
as you see in the sample family site–creation tasks in this chap­
ter, you can easily adapt this design to create sections for each 
member of your family, club, or organization.
Getting Started with the Family or 
Group Site Templates
The templates featured in this chapter are designed to showcase a lot of images 
and would work well for any family Web site, as well as for an art or photo collec­
tion, to illustrate business services or products, or to share vacation photos with 
family and friends.
For this site, you can download templates to create the pages in Dreamweaver as 
well as starter images designed to be used in an image editor, such as Photoshop, 
Photoshop Elements, or Fireworks.
	
All the templates featured in this book can be downloaded for free from the com­
panion Web site that goes with this book. Just visit www.DigitalFamily.com/
diy and follow the instructions to download the various graphic and Web page 
templates.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
As you follow the instructions for creating the family site featured in this chap­
ter, you’ll see how to customize pages, as shown in Figure 9-1, and how to add or 
remove pages to create smaller or larger versions of this site. You also find instruc­
tions for creating interactive features in Dreamweaver, including image maps. 
Because customizing this site involves editing graphics as well as HTML files, you 
find separate tasks for each section of the site:
	
✓	The first task shows you how to customize the banner, text, and images by 
using Photoshop Elements. (I’m using Photoshop Elements 8.) You also find 
out how to add and position images to create the page designs for each sec­
tion of the site.
	
✓	The second task shows you how to set up a site in Dreamweaver and how to 
edit the front page.
	
✓	The third task covers how to edit Dynamic Web Templates in Dreamweaver, 
make changes across many pages at once, set links to pages and remove pages 
from the design.
Figure 9-1: The template featured in this chapter can be altered to create a wide range of different 
kinds of Web sites, such as sites for small or large families.
Before you get started with these tasks, here’s a quick overview of the template and 
files used in this chapter. You can download the family template with all these files 
from the companion Web site for this book at www.DigitalFamily.com/diy.
To help you get started with this site, and to ensure that the links on the navigation 
bars work properly, this template includes starter pages for each of the main sec­
tions of this site. Although you can add or remove pages and change links as nec­
essary, this list describes the files and folders that get you started when you first 
open the Family template:
	
✓	index.html: This is the name of the front page of the Web site. The main 
page of any Web site should be named index; the rest of the pages can 
be named anything you like, as long as you don’t use spaces or special 
characters.

181
 Chapter 9: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
	
✓	images: You find all starter image files in TIFF format in this folder. You 
can create your own banner by editing the text and images in the TIFF file. 
You also find optimized JPEG files in the images folder that you can use as 
you follow along with the tasks. (You find instructions for editing the TIFF 
images and optimizing them in the JPEG format in the first task. You find more 
detailed instructions for editing images in Chapter 5.)
	
✓	css: You find the external style sheets that are attached to the template files 
in this folder.
	
✓	Templates: In this folder, you find the dynamic Web templates used to create 
the files in this site.
	
✓	pages: This folder stores all the pages for the individuals in your site and 
includes these ready-to-use pages:
 
• mom.html: For a parent
 
• dad.html: For a parent
 
• child-1.html: For the first child
 
• child-2.html: For the second child
 
• child-3.html: For the third child
 
• child-4.html: For the fourth child
 
• other.html: For anyone else you want to add
	
You can rename files by using the Dreamweaver Files panel, as you see in the task 
“Designing a Web Page for the Entire Family.” The Files panel lists all pages in a Web 
site; when you make changes in this panel, Dreamweaver automatically adjusts any 
corresponding links already set in the Web site template. If you stick to changing 
only filenames or folders in the Files panel, you never have to worry about breaking 
links.
Getting everyone working on your Web site
As you consider all the ways you can share 
stories and photos with family members 
and friends in your own family Web site, 
make sure to include your entire family in 
the planning-and-development process. 
Here are a few ways you can get family 
members of all ages involved:
	✓	 Ask older family members to write about 
special occasions and family traditions.
	✓	 Scan artwork from younger family 
members, and include those images on 
the site.
	✓	 Invite the family historian to help create 
a family tree and other historical records.
	✓	 Scan photos from old photo albums 
(and don’t forget to sort through those 
boxes of old photos in your attic and 
closets).
	✓	 Include links to clubs, associations, and 
hobby sites to showcase your family’s 
favorite activities.
	✓	 Keep the site updated with photos from 
everyone in the family, by sharing an 
online photo album at Flickr, Shutterfly, 
or the Kodak Gallery. It’s simple and free 
to share photos on any of these sites, as 
I explain in Chapter 7.

182 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
The starter images for this template are designed to showcase images, 
so most of the work in creating this site is best done in an image-editing 
program, such as Photoshop Elements. The trick is to size and prepare 
all images before optimizing them for the Web and putting the pages 
together in Dreamweaver. In this task, you find instructions for adding 
your own images and text to the starter images included in the Family 
template.
This home page starter image has several elements — photos and 
text — and these files can be altered in many ways. In the following 
steps, I show you how to resize and add a photo and then edit the text 
by changing its font size, color, and spacing. After you insert and resize 
all images the way you want on your front page, you find instructions 
for using the Save for Web feature in Photoshop to optimize your 
images and save them as JPEGs so they’re ready to insert into the 
template files in Dreamweaver.
	1.	 Launch a graphics program, such 
as Photoshop Elements (shown in 
the figure), choose File➪Open, and 
open the template graphic file 
Home-Page-Starter-Image.

You can edit the image templates in any image editor that supports layers, including Adobe Photoshop and 
Fireworks. Photoshop Elements 8 is shown in this exercise. You will need to make minor adjustments if you use 
a different version of Photoshop Elements or you use the professional version of Photoshop, but these steps will 
be very similar in all recent versions of Photoshop and Elements.

Tip: You can select a layer by click­
ing it in the Layers panel. If you 
select the Auto Select Layer check 
box (at the top of the workspace), 
you can also select layers by 
simply clicking the image place­
holder or text in the starter image.
	3.	 To edit the text in any image in 
Photoshop Elements, first click to 
select the Type tool in the 
Toolbox. (Look for the capital T.)
	
If, when you open this starter image, you see the error message Some text layers contain fonts 
that are missing, your computer’s hard drive doesn’t have the fonts I used in the starter image. If you 
choose the Text tool in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements and start to edit the text in this file, the program 
automatically changes the text to a font that’s on your hard drive. You can then click and drag to select the text 
and use the options at the top of the workspace to change the font, size, and color to best suit your design. 
I used the Times New Roman font in this design, but you can use any font you prefer. You can purchase and 
download fonts from any number of sites on the Web; just search for Free Fonts in any search engine.

	6.	 To reposition text or images on the page, click 
to select the Move tool from the Toolbox. (In 
Photoshop Elements, the Move tool is repre­
sented by the double-headed, crossed arrow 
icon at the top of the Toolbox). Then click 
and drag any section of text. Remember: If 
you click and drag a corner, you change the 
size of the text or image; if you click in the 
middle of a text area or image and drag, you 
move the selected item.
	5.	 To change the font, color, size, or other text 
options, select the text you want to change 
and adjust the Type tool settings on the 
Options bar, at the top of the work area. In 
this figure, I’m adjusting the font size for the 
selected text.
	4.	 With the Type tool active, click and drag to 
select a section of text and then type to 
replace the words. (If you’re prompted with 
the message Font substitution will 
occur, click OK to continue, and Photoshop 
automatically changes the text to a similar 
font on your hard drive.)

 Chapter 9: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
	7.	 To add a photograph to a layer, you 
must first open the photograph as a 
separate file. While the starter 
image is still open, choose 
File➪Open and select any image 
from your hard drive. In this exam­
ple, I opened a photo of Mark, 
Mary, and Zoe Loos, which I want 
to add to the banner image at the 
top of the page.
	8.	 Before you copy a photo into the starter 
image, it’s helpful to resize it so that it will fit 
the design. I’m going to use this image in the 
banner at the top of the page, so I want to 
resize it to about 225 pixels wide. Hint: each 
placeholder image includes recommended 
dimensions. To resize an image, choose 
Image➪Resize➪Image Size and then change 
the Pixel Dimensions. (You find more 
detailed instructions for resizing images in 
Chapter 5.)
	9.	 To copy an image into the template, first click 
anywhere on the image you want to copy, to 
make it active in the workspace. Choose 
Select➪All to select the image, and then 
choose Edit➪Copy to copy it. Next, click 
anywhere on the starter image (to make it 
active in the workspace) and then choose 
File➪Paste to insert the new image into the 
template. After you paste an image, you can 
click anywhere within the image and drag to 
adjust its placement. You can also click and 
drag a corner to change the size of the image. 
(Note: Make sure the Move tool is selected. 
See Step 6 for a refresher.)

186
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	10.	As you add more images, you can adjust the layers by 
positioning one image in front of another, which is 
important when images overlap or when one image is 
obstructed by another. To move one layer in front of 
another, click and drag the layer to a higher position in 
the Layers panel, or right-click (Option-click on a Mac) 
and select an option to bring the layer forward or back. 
To delete an image or text, click to select it and then 
press the Delete key.
	11.	Continue to open photos you want to add to the 
design, resize them as necessary, and then copy 
and paste them into the starter image. In this 
design, I used three small images on the left, with 
larger versions in the main section of the design, 
but you’ll need to crop a vertical image to get it to 
fit into the small space on the left. To cut a section 
off of an image that you’ve inserted into the design, 
select the Rectangular Marquee tool; then click 
and drag over the portion of the image you want to 
remove, creating a box around the part you want 
to delete, and press the Delete key.
	
You can add as many images as you like, and you can resize them and drag them around the page to change 
the layout. The more you alter this design in Photoshop, however, the more you need to alter it in Dreamweaver. 
For the purposes of this task, I show you how to edit images into these starter images just as it’s designed so 
that you can easily reconstruct them in Dreamweaver. As you get more adept in both Photoshop and 
Dreamweaver, you can make more significant changes.

187
 Chapter 9: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
12.	After you make all the changes you want to the starter 
image, be sure to save your work by choosing 
File➪Save. Then save the file again by choosing 
File➪Save As and name the new file something like 
My-Family-Front-Page. That way, you have a backup 
copy of the completed design before you start slicing up 
the image to save each piece separately, which you do 
in the steps that follow. Hint: If you ever want to go 
back to the original starter image included in the tem­
plate, you can always download another copy from the 
Web site.
	13.	One of the challenges when you design a page 
like this one in Photoshop is deciding how to 
save each of the images as separate files that 
you can insert into your Web pages in 
Dreamweaver. A good place to start is the 
banner. Banners (including this one) typically 
appear at the top of every page in the site, 
but thanks to the magic of Dreamweaver 
Templates, you need only one copy of the 
image. To prepare the banner image for the 
Web, first choose the Crop tool from the 
Toolbox, and then click and drag to fit just 
the top banner area inside the cropping area. 
	14.	You can drag the corners of the crop outline 
to adjust how the banner will be cropped. 
To complete the crop, just double-click in 
the middle of the crop area or click the Crop 
tool again and click Crop in the confirmation 
dialog box that appears.
	15.	After you crop out just the banner image, 
choose File➪Save for Web to save the 
cropped portion as a new file optimized 
for the Web.

188
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	18.	Save each cropped section of the 
image in turn, using the Save for 
Web dialog box. After you save all 
the pieces of your design, you’re 
ready to move on to the next task 
and put them all together using 
Dreamweaver.
	17.	Now for the part that may seem tricky at first 
but will save you lots of time after you get the 
hang of it. After you save a new version of the 
banner optimized for the Web, you will see 
the original image you cropped still open in 
Photoshop. Choose Edit➪Undo Crop to restore 
the full image. Now you can crop the next part 
of the image you want to save for your Web site.
	16.	In the Save for Web dialog box that 
appears, choose JPEG from the 
Optimized File Format drop-down 
list. JPEG format works best for 
images that use millions of colors, 
such as photographs. Adjust other 
settings, such as compression, 
and click OK. Then, in the Save 
Optimized As dialog box, enter a 
name for the new image, make 
sure to save the image into the 
images folder in the Family Web 
Site template folder, and click 
Save. (You find more detailed 
instructions for optimizing images 
with the Save for Web dialog box 
in Chapter 5.)

189
 Chapter 9: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
In this task, you set up a new Web site with the Family Web Site tem­
plate, which can be used to create any site that features multiple people 
or sections. As you work through the following steps, remember that 
you can alter this template a little (by simply adding your own text and 
images) or alter the design a lot by changing the colors, font options, 
and other style settings to make the design more your own.
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪New Site. In 
the Site Definition dialog box, click the 
Advanced tab. In the Site Name text box, 
type a name for your site. In this example, 
I entered Loos Family. Click the Browse 
icon next to the Local Root Folder text box 
and locate on your hard drive the folder that 
contains the Family Web Site template.
	
If you want to rename the folder that contains the Family Web Site Template, do so before completing the site 
definition process. If you change the name of the main root folder of a Web site after you complete the site 
setup process, you have to repeat the setup steps to identify the renamed folder as the local root folder in 
Dreamweaver.

	4.	 Double-click the index.html file 
in the Files panel to open the home 
page. The home page of this site is 
designed to showcase photos and 
text created in an image program, 
as you do in the previous task 
using Photoshop Elements. You 
can replace any of the image place­
holders with images you’ve pre­
pared for the Web.
	3.	 When you complete the site setup process, 
the files and folders in the Family Web Site 
template are displayed in the Files panel in 
Dreamweaver, at the side of the workspace. 
If the Files panel isn’t visible, choose 
Window➪Files to open it. (For more detailed

	2.	 Click the Browse icon next to the Default 
Images folder field. In the Choose Local Images 
Folder dialog box that appears, select the 
Images folder in the Family template site and 
click Open. Back in the Site Definition dialog 
box, leave the rest of the options alone for now, 
and click OK. If you haven’t selected the Enable 
Cache check box, a message box appears, 
asking whether you want to create a cache for 
the site. Click Yes to speed up some of the 
Dreamweaver display features.

	5.	 At the very top of the home page, change the page title 
by replacing the text in the Title field. Include your 
name or a brief title to identify your page. (The page title 
is the text that appears at the very top of the browser 
window when a page is viewed online and the text that’s 
saved when someone bookmarks your page.)
	6.	 To insert your own images, 
double-click to select any image 
placeholder. In the Select Image 
Source dialog box navigate your 
hard drive to locate the image 
you want to insert, click to 
select the image you want to 
add to the page, and then 
click OK.

repeat Step 6. To delete an image 
or placeholder, select it and press 
the Delete key.
	
You want images on your site to download quickly and display well on-screen, so make sure that you optimize 
your images and save them in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format before adding them to your Web pages. You find 
instructions for editing the starter image for this template in the first part of this chapter and you find detailed 
instructions for saving images for the Web in Chapter 5.

192 Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Adding more pages to your family, business, or other Web site, is easy 
when you use Dreamweaver templates, like the ones I created for this 
book. And once you’ve added pages, you can use the template to auto­
matically link the new page to all of the other pages. This family tem­
plate, like all of the other templates featured in this book, includes a few 
pages to get you started, but you can always add more by following the 
instructions in this task.
In this task, you discover how to create a new page from a 
Dreamweaver template and link that page to all of the other pages in 
the site:
	1.	 Before you create a new page in a site, make 
sure you’ve completed the site set up pro­
cess in Dreamweaver, which is covered in 
the previous task. To create a new page from 
a template, choose File➪New. 
	2.	 In the left side of New Document 
dialog box, choose Page from 
Template, in the Site section, make 
sure that the site you are working 
on is selected, and then choose the 
template you want to use to create 
your new page. A preview of the 
template is displayed in the right 
side of the dialog window. Click 
Create to create a new page and 
close the dialog box.

	3.	 It’s always good practice to 
save a new page as soon as it’s 
created in Dreamweaver. It’s 
also a good idea to include a 
brief description with a few key 
words specific to the content of 
each page in the Title field. In 
this example, I named the page 
news.html and I changed the 
title to News from The Loos 
Family.
	4.	 You can edit or add text to any 
editable regions of the new page, 
which are identified with a light 
green box and an editable heading, 
such as the mainContent region 
shown here. Anything within the 
editable region is easy to change, 
such as the headline which I 
changed by selecting the text “H1 
level heading” and replaced by 
typing in “New from the Loos 
Family.” Remember, you can’t 
change content in the locked 
regions of the page, such as the 
banner region at the top of the 
page or the links and copyright 
information at the bottom. Those 
areas can be changed only in the 
template. If you roll your cursor 
over a locked region, the cursor 
arrow changes to a circle with a 
line through it, indicating it can be 
edited only in the template itself.

194
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	6.	 If you want to make changes to all 
the pages created from a template, 
such as adding a link to your new 
page, you must first open the 
Dreamweaver template itself by 
choosing File➪Open and then 
opening the .dwt template file, 
which is stored in the Templates 
folder in the main root folder of 
your Web site. In the family tem­
plate, the Dreamweaver template 
file is called inside-pages.dwt.
	5.	 To add images to an editable 
region of a page, simply click to 
place your cursor where you want 
to add a new image and choose 
Insert➪Image. In the Select Image 
Source dialog window, navigate 
your hard drive to find the image 
you want to add and then double-
click the image name to select it, 
close the dialog, and insert it into 
the page. After you insert an image 
into a page, click to select the 
image and you can use the 
Property Inspector at the bottom 
of the workspace to make addi­
tional changes, such as aligning 
the image to the right or left, 
which you can do by choosing 
float-right or float-left from the 
Class drop-down list. 

195
 Chapter 9: Creating a Family, Vacation, or Hobby Site
	9.	 When you save the template file, 
Dreamweaver automatically opens the 
Update Template Files dialog box and lists all 
the pages created from the template. Click 
Update to add the new link to all the pages.
	8.	 In the Select File dialog box, navi­
gate to find the file to which you 
want to link. In this example, I 
selected the news.html page, 
which I created in the first part of 
this task. Click to select the file and 
then click OK to create the link and 
close the dialog box.
	7.	 You can add a link to the bottom of this tem­
plate by simply typing in the text you want to 
serve as the link. To make the text a link, 
click and drag to select the text and then 
click the link icon in the Common Insert 
menu (or choose Insert➪Hyperlink).

	10.	To test your links, preview the page 
in a Web browser by choosing 
File➪Preview in Browser and then 
selecting any browser you have 
associated with Dreamweaver. 
When you view the pages in a 
browser, even on your local com­
puter, you can easily follow the 
links by clicking them just as you 
would on a Web page that has been 
published on the Internet. You 
learn more about previewing your 
Web pages and publishing your site 
to a Web server in Chapter 10.

Chapter 10
Testing and Publishing a Web Site
I
t’s a shocking scenario: You create a page design that looks 
just perfect in your favorite Web browser on your own com­
puter. You publish it on the Internet and tell all your friends. And 
the next thing you know, your cousin in Iowa and your friends in 
Brazil are telling you that it looks terrible, the text is unreadable, 
and your Flash files don’t play at all.
Don’t let this happen to you. Take time to test your work before 
you publish the site for the entire world to see so you can 
make sure that it will work well in all the different Web browsers, 
operating systems, and monitor sizes that your visitors are likely 
to use.
Before you “go live” with your site, preview your pages in as many Web browsers 
as possible to make sure that your site looks the way you intend in the many differ­
ent browsers in use on the Internet. If you don’t have that many browsers on your 
own computer, don’t worry. You can find many tips in this chapter to help you, 
including a collection of online services where you can test how your site will dis­
play in dozens of Web browsers on four different operating systems.
And, as you’ll discover in the tasks in this chapter, it’s a relatively simple step 
to use the many Dreamweaver testing features to ensure that all your links work 
properly, and to check for common compatibility problems that can lead to differ­
ences in browser display.
In the first part of this chapter, you find detailed instructions for previewing pages 
and using the Dreamweaver testing tools. In the second part of the chapter, you 
find out how to use the built-in Dreamweaver File Transfer Protocol (FTP) features 
to copy your Web site from your hard drive to a Web server on the Internet. And 
finally, you find instructions for adding Google Analytics (and other traffic-tracking 
services) to your site so you can see how many people visit your pages, where 
they come from, and how they get there — all of which play an important part of 
gauging the effectiveness of your site.

Understanding How Web Pages 
Look on Different Computers
One of the more confusing and frustrating aspects of Web design is that you can 
create a page that looks great in Dreamweaver and test it in a browser to confirm 
that it looks fine only to discover later that it looks terrible in a different browser 
or on a different computer system. Web pages can look different from one system 
to another for many reasons, but the following issues are the most common 
culprits:
	
✓	Browser differences: Today, dozens of browsers are in use on the Web, not 
counting the different versions of each browser. For example, at the time of 
this writing, Internet Explorer (IE) 8 is the newest release from Microsoft, 
but a significant percentage of Web users haven’t upgraded yet and are still 
using IE6 or even earlier versions. (More on browser differences in the next 
section.)
	
✓	Hardware differences: Another challenge comes from the differences between 
Macintosh and Windows computers. For example, most fonts appear smaller 
on a Macintosh than on a PC (Times 12 on a PC looks like Times 10 on a Mac). 
Image colors can also vary from one computer to another.
	
✓	Individual resolution settings: In addition, the same Web page may look very 
different on a 21" monitor than it does on a 15" monitor. And even on the same 
monitor, different resolution settings can alter the way a page looks. On a PC, 
a common resolution is 1024 x 768; on a Mac, the resolution is generally set 
much higher, making the design look much smaller, even if the monitor sizes 
are the same.
As a result of all these differences, the same Web page can look very different to 
the many people who visit a Web site. For example, Figure 10-1 shows a Web page 
in Internet Explorer on a PC, and Figure 10-2 shows the same page in Safari on a 
Macintosh. Notice that the text displays in a larger font size on the PC, changing 
how the text wraps around the photo in the left column.
This challenging aspect of the Web is at the root of many of the limitations 
and complications of creating good Web designs. With patience, testing, and 
an understanding of the tags and styles that are most problematic, you can 
create great Web sites that look good to most, if not all, of the people who 
visit your Web site.

199

Figure 10-1: A Web page displayed in IE 6 on a PC with the monitor set to 1024 x 768 resolution. 
Note that the right column has been bumped down below the left column, 
a common problem in IE6.
Figure 10-2: The same Web page displayed in Safari 3 on a Mac with the monitor 
set to 1280 x 800. This is how the designer expected the site to look.

200
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Understanding How Browsers 
Affect a Site’s Appearance
Of the many reasons why Web pages can look different from one browser to 
another, it boils down to this: Web browsers have evolved over the years to sup­
port new technologies on the Web. Thus, many older browsers still in use have 
trouble displaying some of the advanced features you can use on your Web pages 
today. Compounding this problem, the companies that make Web browsers — 
including Microsoft, Google, and Apple — don’t all agree or follow the same rules 
(although most are getting better at complying with the same set of standards in 
their latest browser versions). Dozens of browsers are now in use on the Web, not 
counting the different versions of each browser. For example, as I mention earlier, 
IE8 is the newest release from Microsoft (at the time of this writing), but a signifi­
cant percentage of Web users haven’t yet upgraded and are still using IE7 or even 
IE6, which is notoriously bad at displaying CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and other 
modern Web features.
The result is that the same Web page can look significantly different to the many 
people who visit a Web site. The differences can become even more pronounced in 
older browsers or in monitors of different sizes.
This challenging aspect of Web design is at the root of many of the limitations and 
complications of creating Web sites that look good to everyone who may visit your 
pages. HTML was designed to help ensure that Web pages look good on every 
computer on the planet, and as a result, some of the rules of Web design may seem 
strange or limiting at first. Despite these efforts, and a growing movement toward 
more standardized Web development, getting your pages to look exactly the same 
on every computer on the planet is difficult if not impossible. As a result, most 
designers strive to create pages that look as good as possible on as many browsers 
as they consider important, even if the same pages don’t look exactly the same on 
all browsers.
Which browsers you should design for depends on your audience. If you have the 
luxury of having accurate reports on the visitors to your site, you can see a list of 
all browsers used by visitors to your site. (At the end of this chapter is information 
about using Web-statistic services that include browser usage information.) For 
example, your Web statistics may reveal that 27 percent of your audience uses IE7, 
18 percent uses IE6, 25 percent uses Firefox 3, 23 percent uses Firefox 2, 5 percent 
uses Chrome, and 2 percent uses Safari. With those numbers in mind, you may 
decide that your pages should look attractive in IE and Firefox, but you’ll settle 
for them not looking quite as good in Safari and Chrome, which at this point have 
lesser percent of your audience and display some features quite differently.
Entire books and Web sites are dedicated to the differences among browsers, and 
how to best design for everyone on the Web. To help keep things simple for you, I 
include templates in this book that are designed to look best in the most recent and 
most commonly used browsers on the Web, including IE8 and IE7, and Firefox 3 and 
2. However, you should note that making significant changes to these designs may 
result in unpredictable results, which is another important reason to test your work 
thoroughly before you publish your site.

Previewing Web Pages in Multiple Browsers
Previewing your Web pages in a variety of Web browsers is the simplest 
way to make sure that they look suitable to at least most of your visi­
tors. The following task walks you through the process of adding brows­
ers to Dreamweaver for easy previewing and for viewing the same Web 
page in multiple browsers.
Toolbox:
✓	 Adobe Dreamweaver
✓	 Microsoft Internet 
Explorer
✓	 Mozilla Firefox
✓	 Apple Safari, Google 
Chrome, or another Web 
browser
✓	 Completed Web pages
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Open a Web page that you want to preview 
in Dreamweaver, choose File➪Preview in 
Browser, and choose a Web browser from 
the list of browser options. (You find out 
how to add more browsers to this list in 
Steps 3 and 6.)
	2.	 Study the page carefully, testing all the links, 
rollovers, and any other special effects to 
make sure that the page appears how you 
want in this browser.
Time needed:
Less than half 
an hour

202
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	3.	 Return to Dreamweaver to make any changes 
you want to the page. Then test the same page 
in other Web browsers. To add browsers to the 
preview list, choose File➪Preview in Browser 
and then choose Edit Browser List.
	4.	 After the Preferences dialog box opens to 
the Preview in Browser settings, click the 
plus (+) sign at the top of the dialog box to 
open the Add Browser dialog box. Enter a 
name for the browser. (I like to include the 
version number as well as the name, as 
I have here, with Firefox 3.) Then click the 
Browse button.
	5.	 Find the browser you want to add on your hard 
drive, click to select it, and then click Open to add 
it to the browser list in Dreamweaver. Note: You 
can add only those browsers to Dreamweaver 
that are on your hard drive. (See the nearby side­
bar “Downloading new browsers” to find out more 
about finding and downloading new browsers for 
testing.) Look for the browser’s executable file 
(with an .exe extension) rather than a shortcut 
on your desktop that you may use to launch the 
browser.
	6.	 Repeat Steps 3–5 to add more browsers to 
the list. You can then designate which 
browser you want as your primary browser: 
the browser that’s launched when the F12 
key is first pressed. You can also designate a 
secondary browser, which appears second 
on the list and will launch and display the 
same Web page if you press Ctrl+F12 on 
Windows or Ô+F12 on a Mac.

203
 Chapter 10: Testing and Publishing a Web Site
	7.	 You can also preview a page in a 
browser by clicking the Preview/
Debug in Browser icon (it looks 
like a globe), at the top of the 
workspace, and selecting any 
browser from the list.
	8.	 Adobe Device Central is available in 
Dreamweaver versions CS3 and CS4. 
(You don’t have this option if 
you’reusing an older version of 
Dreamweaver.) Device Central is 
designed to help you create and test 
Web sites for mobile devices, such 
as cell phones. Using Device Central, 
you can preview your Web pages in 
many different cell phone models by 
first clicking the plus sign next to 
the device type and then any of the

So how do you put new browsers on your hard drive so that you can preview your pages 
with them? The simplest way to get the latest versions is to visit the Web sites of the com­
panies that create the most popular browsers:
	✓	 Microsoft Internet Explorer: www.microsoft.com/ie
	✓	 Mozilla Firefox: www.firefox.com
	✓	 Apple Safari (Mac only): www.apple.com/safari
	✓	 Google Chrome: www.google.com/chrome

Testing Sites with Online Browser Emulators
Unless you own a dozen computers with different operating systems and a 
vast collection of Web browsers, you can’t fully test your Web site on your 
own. Fortunately, a growing number of online services are available to help 
you preview your pages on many different operating systems and browsers, 
without having to manage multiple computers and browsers yourself.
Here are some of the best places to test your Web site online:
Xenocode Browser Sandbox (www.xenocode.com/Browsers). The 
Xenocode browser sandbox makes it easy for you to test a site using any of the 
eight most popular browsers without having to install them all on your system. 
You simply download and install a plug-in from the Xenocode site and then 
click the browser you want to use. After the selected browser launches, you 
can surf the Web as if the browser were installed on your computer. The ser­
vice is free (at the time of this writing). And because you can surf through the 
browsers, you can interact with Web sites, testing all your pages, as well as 
JavaScript, AJAX, and other interactive features.
Adobe Browser Labs (https://browserlab.adobe.com). Adobe 
Browser Labs makes it possible for you to test any Web page on the 
Internet in the most common browsers. At the time of this writing, that 
includes IE versions 6 and 7, Mozilla Firefox versions 2 and 3, and Apple 
Safari version 3. You can also test pages on different operating systems, 
such as Windows XP and Mac OS X. When you use this service, the result is 
a screenshot with a preview of the page, which offers a quick and easy way 
to test pages’ display. Small downside: You can’t test interactive features, 
and you can test in only two browsers at a time.
Cross Browser Testing (www.crossbrowsertesting.com). The Cross 
Browser Testing site takes Web site–testing to another level. Instead of simply 
providing screenshots of a Web page in different browsers, or letting you 
launch a few browsers to test pages in, this site lets you take over other com­
puters connected to the Internet so that you can test interactive features using 
a variety of browsers and operating systems. For example, if you use a com­
puter that runs Windows Vista and you want to see what your site will look like 
on a Mac, you can choose to use a computer with the Mac OS and then view 
your site in any of a dozen browsers on the Mac system. The advantage is that 
you get more than snapshots, and you also can test interactive features, such 
as JavaScript, AJAX, forms, and more. This service requires that you purchase 
a monthly subscription.
Browsershots (www.browsershots.org). Browsershots is a popular online 
testing tool. You simply enter a page’s URL and choose the options you want 
to use for testing. Browsershots then tests the page you submitted on each 
computer system selected with the specified browser and takes a screenshot. 
Although you can’t test interactive features with this service, it’s one of the 
easiest options and provides the largest collection of browsers to choose 
from. (You find instructions for using Browsershots in this task.) The basic ser­
vice is free, but it can take a few minutes or a few hours to complete testing. If 
you don’t like waiting, you can upgrade to “priority processing” for a fee.

	4.	 Click any of the thumbnail images to see a 
slightly larger version. If you find that a page 
doesn’t display properly in a browser, such as 
the one shown here in IE6, you can then use 
Dreamweaver to make adjustments to the page 
layout and test it again to see whether the 
display improves.
	1.	 At www.browsershots.org, enter the URL 
of the page you want to test in the Enter URL 
Here field. (Note: You can test only those 
pages that are published on a Web server, but 
you can test any of those pages. For exam­
ple, I can test www.californiawildlife
photography.com (as I’m doing here), and 
I can also test www.californiawildlife
photography.com/gallery to (test the 
gallery page separately). Browsershots can 
test only one page at a time.
	2.	 Browsershots offers an exhaustive array of browser 
options (more than 92 different Web browsers and ver­
sions to choose from), and you can choose to test any 
browser available on any or all of the major operating 
systems, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, and BSD. 
You can’t, however, select specific versions of these 
operating systems. Place a check mark next to each 
browser you want to test, but keep in mind that the 
more options you choose, the longer it will take.
	3.	 The result is a collection of thumbnail 
screenshots that give you a literal snapshot 
of how your page looks across many differ­
ent browsers and systems. It can take a few 
minutes or a few hours to complete testing, 
depending on how busy the service is and 
how many options you choose.

Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
Designing for mobile devices
With the rising popularity of Internet-
enabled mobile devices, a new audience 
of Web page visitors has emerged. Some 
high-end mobile devices (think iPhone and 
BlackBerry Storm) are capable of load­
ing Web pages and do so reasonably well. 
However, the screen is much smaller, and 
the interactions with the Web browser is 
much different — specifically, navigating by 
touch. Lower-end regular mobile devices 
that make up the vast majority of the market 
often have small screens, reduced color dis­
play, and allow only minimal interaction.
To best manage the dramatic differences on 
mobile devices, my best recommendation is 
that you create a second version of your Web 
site designed to best serve the limited dis­
play options of mobile devices and link to the 
alternate design from your main site. If you 
have experience writing server scripts (or 
can hire someone to do it for you), you can 
create an auto-detect script that can deter­
mine whether a visitor to your site is using a 
mobile phone or a computer and direct them 
to the best version of your site automatically.
Here are a few important tips to consider 
when designing for mobile devices:
	✓	 Because download times are much 
slower on mobile devices, adjust the 
number of features you offer to mobile 
devices, and keep the number of images 
and style minimal.
	✓	 Use CSS for the design and layout of the 
Web page. Outdated HTML styling and 
layout options (such as frames) may not 
display at all on mobile devices.
	✓	 Screen size on a mobile device is 
extremely limited, with less width and 
more height than traditional computer 
monitors. (The view is more rectangular 
than square.) Optimize your content and 
design accordingly.
	✓	 There is no mouse on the mobile 
phone — only up and down arrows, and 
at best a touch screen. Adjust your 
design to require as little scrolling and 
user movement as possible.
	✓	 Always validate your Web page code 
(numerous validation services are online, 
such as the one at http://validator.
w3.org). Mobile browsers are even less 
forgiving than traditional Web site 
browsers about errors in your code.
	✓	 Very few mobile devices support 
JavaScript, so don’t use it in the mobile 
version of a Web site.
	✓	 Not all mobile devices support Flash or 
other multimedia formats. Use multime­
dia sparingly and make sure to include 
links to alternative content for visitors 
who may not be able to view these 
features.
	✓	 Test with mobile phone emulators, such 
as Dreamweaver’s Device Central (fea­
tured in the first task in this chapter), 
and the online emulators available at 
http://ready.mobi and http://
mtld.mobi/emulator.php.
	✓	 Test interactive features on a variety of 
mobile phones. If you can’t afford to buy 
several phones (and who can?), ask your 
friends and coworkers to test your site 
on their phones.
	✓	 Visit stores that sell mobile phones and 
ask for a demo of the phone’s Web 
browser capabilities; then make sure to 
view your own site while you’re testing 
the phone. Although it can take some 
time to run around town visiting mobile 
phone stores and doing demos, it’s a 
cheap way to test in a variety of modern 
devices, and you might even find your 
new favorite phone.

devices, check out my book Mobile Web 
Design For Dummies (Wiley).

Using the Dreamweaver Link-Testing Features
Test, test, and test some more. To help you ensure that all the bells and 
whistles on your Web site ring and ding the way they should, a variety 
of Dreamweaver features make it easy to test your pages for broken 
links and other potential problems. In the task that follows, you find 
instructions for using some of these high-powered testing tools on a 
completed Web page.
Toolbox:
✓	 Adobe Dreamweaver
✓	 A Web site with linked 
pages
Stuff You Need to 
Know
	1.	 Make sure that the site you want to test is 
selected and active in the Files panel. (To 
open the Files panel, choose Window➪Files.) 
If you haven’t yet completed the site setup 
process, see Chapter 6 to take care of this 
important initial step.
	2.	 To test the links in a Web site, 
choose Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
Time needed:
About half 
an hour

208
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	5.	 In addition to identifying broken links to pages within a Web site, the Dreamweaver link report lists 
other kinds of links. For example, you can use the drop-down list shown here to view all the external 
links, or links in a site that go to other Web sites. This makes it easy to test links to other sites to 
make sure that the Web site address hasn’t changed. Note that to check external links, you must pre­
view a page in a browser on a computer with an active Internet connection. You also display a list of 
unused files in a site by choosing Orphaned files from the drop-down menu. Orphaned files are HTML 
pages that aren’t linked to any other pages, as well as images and multimedia files that aren’t 
inserted into any pages in your site.
	3.	 The report from the Check Links 
feature is displayed at the bottom 
of the workspace. If Dreamweaver 
reports a broken link, like the one 
shown here (to the about me.html 
file), double-click the filename. 
Dreamweaver highlights the corre­
sponding text or image with the 
broken link so that you can easily 
see where you need to fix the link.
	4.	 You can fix broken links in a 
number of ways; the simplest is to 
reset the link by following the same 
steps you find in Chapter 6 for cre­
ating links. As in the example 
shown here, where I’m fixing a link 
from one page in a Web site to 
another page in the same site, start 
by making sure that the linked text 
is selected. Then click the Browse 
button (the yellow file folder icon 
next to the Link field) in the 
Property Inspector to locate the 
correct filename. (For more 
detailed instructions on creating 
links, see Chapter 6.)

 Chapter 10: Testing and Publishing a Web Site
Setting Up FTP in Dreamweaver
Okay, you created a Web site and tested it, and you’re ready to upload 
it to the Web. It’s time to put the Dreamweaver publishing tools to 
work. If you’re using a commercial service provider, you most likely 
need the Dreamweaver FTP features, covered in detail in this task and 
the remaining tasks in this chapter.
Note that you must complete the site setup process, covered in the 
beginning of Chapter 6, before you can configure the site for uploading. 
You also need the following information from your Web hosting service 
(find tips for choosing a Web host in Chapter 3):
	
✓	The FTP host name
	
✓	The path to the Web directory (optional but useful, and should 
look similar to this: /web/htdocs/jcwarner)
	
✓	An FTP login or user name
	
✓	An FTP password
After you gather all your FTP information and complete the site setup, 
you’re ready to access the Dreamweaver publishing tools and prepare 
the program to upload your Web site. In this task, you set up 
Dreamweaver to connect to your server via FTP, a process you need to 
do only once for each site you work on. In the next task, you use 
Dreamweaver to upload pages to your server by using the connection 
you establish in this task. Follow these steps:
Toolbox:
✓	 Adobe Dreamweaver
✓	 A Web site ready to be 
published
✓	 A Web server or hosting 
service
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Choose Site➪Manage Sites to open the 
Manage Sites dialog box. Alternatively, 
you can choose Manage Sites from the 
Site drop-down list in the Files panel.
Time needed:
About half 
an hour
	2.	 In the list of defined sites, select the 
site you want to publish. Then click 
the Edit button.

210
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	3.	 Select the Advanced tab at the top of the Site 
Definition dialog box, and then select the 
Remote Info category from the left side.
	4.	 Click the arrow for the Access drop-down list 
box, and then choose the publishing option best 
suited to your Web server and development 
environment. If you’re using a commercial Web 
host (the most common option for small do-it-
yourself sites), choose FTP. If you’re working at 
a university, a large company, or an organiza­
tion that has its own Web servers, refer to the 
nearby sidebar, “The multiple Dreamweaver 
publishing options,” to understand your choices 
here, and check with your system administrator 
to find out which option is best for your system.
	5.	 In the FTP Host text box, type the host name of your Web server. In 
my example, I used ftp.austinrelax.com. In the Host Directory 
text box, type the directory on the remote site in which documents 
visible to the public are stored. In my example, I used /web/
austinrelax/. The information you enter in this field depends 
on your server. In some cases, you can leave the field blank if you 
log in directly to your site; in other cases, you use a different path, 
such as users/mysite/domain. Check with your service provider 
or site administrator to find out how your server is set up.

211
 Chapter 10: Testing and Publishing a Web Site
	6.	 Enter your login name and password. Web services require a username 
and password to gain access to your Web server to ensure that you’re 
the only person who can make changes to your Web site. If you select 
the Save check box, Dreamweaver stores the information on your local 
computer and you don’t have to retype it every time you log in to your 
Web server. Click the Test button to make sure that you entered every­
thing correctly. If there are no problems, Dreamweaver responds with 
the message Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 connected to your Web 
server successfully.
	7.	 Select the Use Passive FTP option or the Use Firewall 
option only if your service provider or site administrator 
instructs you to do so. If you use a commercial Web 
hosting service, you shouldn’t need to select any remain­
ing options in this section of the dialog box. Select the 
use Secure FTP check box if you have a secure Web 
server, but be aware that not all hosts support secure 
FTP. If you select this option and see an error message 
when you press the Test button, deselect the option and 
test again.
The multiple Dreamweaver publishing options
In the Remote Info category of the Site 
Definition dialog box, you find the fol­
lowing options when you click the Access 
drop-down list. The following list briefly 
describes when you should select each 
choice. (If you’re using a commercial Web 
hosting service, the FTP option should be 
your best choice.)
	✓	 None: When you aren’t uploading your 
site to a server or when you aren’t yet 
ready to fill in these settings.
	✓	 FTP: When you’re using the built-in 
Dreamweaver File Transfer Protocol fea­
tures, which are covered in detail in the 
following section. You’re most likely to 
need these settings if you’re using a 
commercial Web hosting service.
	✓	 Local/Network: When you’re using a 
Web server on a local network, such as 
your company or university server. For 
specific settings and requirements, 
check with your system administrator.
	✓	 WebDAV (Web-based Distributed 
Authoring and Versioning): When 
you’re using a server with the WebDAV 
protocol, such as Microsoft IIS.
	✓	 RDS (Remote Development Services): 
When you’re using ColdFusion on a 
remote server.
	✓	 Microsoft Visual SourceSafe: When 
you’re 
using 
Microsoft 
Visual 
SourceSafe. (This option is available 
only in Windows.)

212
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	9.	 Click OK to save your Web server information settings and close the Site Definition 
dialog box. You’re ready to start using the Dreamweaver FTP features, covered in 
the next section.
	8.	 Select the Maintain Synchronization Information check box; Dreamweaver then automatically keeps 
track of any changes you make to pages on your local computer that haven’t been uploaded to the 
server. Note: I never recommend that you select the Automatically Upload Files to Server on Save 
check box because I think that you should test your pages on your local computer before you pub­
lish them to the local site. Leaving this box deselected prevents the possibility of accidentally 
uploading errors automatically every time you save a page on your local computer. The Enable File 
Check In and Check Out option opens an advanced feature that can be used to track files when multi­
ple people are working on a Web site. You can find more information on this and other site manage­
ment features in my book Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies (Wiley).
	
If you try to connect to your server and see the message An FTP error occurred, it usually means that 
you entered characters incorrectly. Be very careful as you type your username, password, and other information 
because most servers are case sensitive and require that these fields be filled in with the exact host, directory, 
login, and password information. If you still have trouble, contact your service provider or site administrator to 
ensure that you have all the correct information for connecting to your server. Setting up all this information cor­
rectly the first time can be tricky, and each service provider is different.

 Chapter 10: Testing and Publishing a Web Site
Uploading Files with the Dreamweaver 
FTP Features
After you enter all your Web server and login information into 
Dreamweaver (as you do in the previous task), you can upload files to 
your server and retrieve them at any time by using the built-in FTP 
capabilities of Dreamweaver.
To transfer files between your hard drive and a remote server, follow 
these steps:
Toolbox:
✓	 Adobe Dreamweaver
✓	 A Web site with linked 
pages
✓	 Access to a Web server
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Make sure that the site you want to upload is 
selected and visible in the Files panel and 
that you entered all the FTP settings 
described in the previous section. Then, 
in the upper-left corner of the Files panel, 
click the Connects to Remote Host icon. 
(It looks like a plug and an outlet.)
	
If you’re not already connected to the Internet, the Connects to Remote Host icon attempts to start your dialup 
connection. If you have trouble connecting this way, try establishing your Internet connection as usual to check 
e-mail or surf the Web, and then return to Dreamweaver and click the Connects to Remote Host icon after 
establishing your Internet connection. When your computer is online, Dreamweaver should have no trouble 
automatically establishing an FTP connection with your host server.
Time needed:
About half 
an hour

214
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	2.	 When the connection is established, the blue Connects 
to Remote Host icon changes to look like the plugs are 
connected (or, dare I say, plugged in). After the connec­
tion is established, you can view the files and folders on 
your Web server by choosing Remote View from the 
drop-down list in the upper-right corner. (It’s shown 
open in this figure.) Using the drop-down arrow, you can 
easily switch between Local view (displays the files and 
folders in the root site folder on your local hard drive) 
and Remote view by selecting each one in turn.
	3.	 To see both Local and Remote views simultaneously, expand the Files 
panel by clicking the Expand icon, in the upper-right corner of the Files 
panel. With the panel expanded, you can upload and download files by 
dragging them from one pane to the other. To minimize the Files panel, 
click the same icon again. In this figure, the Files panel is expanded and 
the cursor is hovering over the icon, which is labeled Collapse when the 
Files panel is expanded.

215
 Chapter 10: Testing and Publishing a Web Site
	4.	 To upload a file (transfer a file from 
your hard drive to your Web 
server), select the file from the 
Local View panel (which displays 
the files on your hard drive) and 
click the Put Files icon (the up 
arrow) in the Files panel. If a dialog 
box appears with the message Put 
dependent files, choose No to 
upload only the selected file. 
Choose Yes, and Dreamweaver 
uploads the selected file, plus any 
files that appear within that file, 
such as images or multimedia files 
that are inserted into a page.
	5.	 Files are copied to your server 
when you transfer them, leaving 
the file on the local computer 
untouched. You can select multiple 
files or folders to be transferred 
simultaneously.
	
When you copy files to or from your server, the files you’re transferring overwrite the files already at the destina­
tion. Dreamweaver notifies you about the overwriting if it notices that you’re replacing a newer version of a file 
with an old one, but it’s always a good idea to double-check before you overwrite a file.

216
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	
After you upload files to your server, test your work by using a Web browser to view the pages online. 
Sometimes, things that look and work fine on your computer don’t work on the server, so you should always 
test the pages on the server right away.
	6.	 To download files or folders (trans­
fer files or folders from your Web 
server to your hard drive), select 
the files or folders from the Remote 
Site panel (which displays the files 
on your server) and click the Get 
Files button (the down arrow) in the 
Files panel. The files are automati­
cally copied to your hard drive 
when you transfer them.
Using dedicated FTP programs
If you prefer to use a dedicated FTP pro­
gram rather than the built-in Dreamweaver 
features, you can download one of these 
popular FTP programs for the Mac or PC:
	✓	 FireFTP: A Firefox add-on that you can 
download for free from http://
fireftp.mozdev.org.
	✓	 WS_FTP: On a PC, you can find this pro­
gram with the unusual name at www.
ipswitch.com.
	✓	 CuteFTP: Download this Windows pro­
gram from www.cuteftp.com.
	✓	 Fetch: If you use a Macintosh computer, 
check out this program, available at 
www.fetchsoftworks.com.
	✓	 Transmit: You can download this pro­
gram, also for the Mac, at www.panic.
com/transmit.
	✓	 FileZilla: This is a great open-source FTP 
program available for PC, Linux, or Mac 
at http://filezilla-project.org.

Adding Google Analytics to your Site
One of the greatest advantages of publishing information on the Web is 
that you can track how people use that information, how they find it, 
where they come from, and more. There are many ways to gather data 
about visitors to your Web site. Most Web hosting services provide 
access to some kind of server logs that include basic information, such 
as how many people visit your site every day, week, month, or year.
If you want more information, consider using one of the third-party statis­
tic services, such as Google Analytics, covered in the next task, or any of 
the similar services included in the sidebar, “Using online Web-traffic ser­
vices.” Google Analytics is the most popular Web traffic–reporting soft­
ware available on the Web today. And it’s no surprise. Google Analytics is 
powerful, comprehensive, remarkably easy to use — and free!
Follow these steps to add Google Analytics to your site.
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Sign up for an account at Google 
Analytics (www.google.com/
analytics). If you already have a 
Google account, such as one you 
use for Gmail, just click the big 
blue Access Analytics button, and 
you can use your existing account 
as you sign up for Analytics. If 
you’re new to Google, click the 
Sign Up Now link and create a new 
account when you sign up for 
Analytics.

218
Part II: Putting the Pages Together 
	3.	 On the Create New Website Profile 
page that appears, select Add a 
Profile for a New Domain if you’re 
setting tracking for the first time, or 
select Add a Profile for an Existing 
Domain if you want to track a 
domain with a second profile. Enter 
the URL of the site you want to 
track, select the country and time 
zone from the drop-down lists, and 
then click the Finish button at the 
bottom of the page.
	4.	 Google Analytics provides you with two options: 
New Tracking Code (ga.js) or Legacy Tracking 
Code (urchin.js). I recommend using the new 
tracking code so you have access to the latest 
and greatest new features that aren’t available 
via the legacy code. Select the entire code block 
in the input box and copy it. Then click the 
Finish button at the bottom of the page to return 
to the Overview.
	2.	 After you set up an account, just 
enter your user name and pass­
word to access your account. 
When you log into Google 
Analytics, if you already have 
sites set up with tracking, you’ll 
see them listed on the Overview 
page. To set up a new site, click 
the Add Website Profile link at 
the bottom of the Overview 
page.

219
 Chapter 10: Testing and Publishing a Web Site
	5.	 To add the code to a page in Dreamweaver, click 
the Code button at the top left of the workspace, 
and then scroll down to the bottom of the Web 
page where you want to add the code. With the 
cursor or mouse, select the line immediately 
before the </body> tag and then press Enter 
on your keyboard. Choose Edit➪Paste, and the 
previously copied tracking code from Google 
Analytics is added to your Web page. Save your 
changes.
	6.	 To add Google Analytics code to a WordPress blog, log into the 
Administrative tools for your blog (as if you’re going to add a new post) 
and then choose Appearance from the left side of the Dashboard. Under 
Appearance, choose Editor; then, on the right side of the page, under 
Templates, choose Footer (footer.php). Scroll down to the bottom of the 
page code; just above the close body tag </body>, paste the code from 
Google Analytics. Click Update File, and all the pages in your blog will be 
tracked automatically.
	
If you use Dreamweaver’s .dwt template feature in your Web site, add your Google Analytics to the template 
in an uneditable region, and it will automatically be added to all the pages created from the template. See 
Chapter 6 for more information on templates and adding code to your pages in Dreamweaver.

Using online Web-traffic services
Although Google Analytics is the most pop­
ular online traffic service, there are several 
alternatives, including:
Clicky (www.getclicky.com). Clicky is a 
hosted, real-time Web analytics service 
that provides statistics as they occur (unlike 
most other Web site statistics services). 
Clicky focuses more on current trends as 
opposed to historical data, which is also 
available. Clicky offers both free and paid 
services, and most noticeably offers a 
developer API, Twitter analytics, and dedi­
cated mobile and iPhone versions. Clicky 
also works on browsers without JavaScript 
enabled. None of these services are offered 
by Google Analytics.
Yahoo! Web Analytics (http://web.
analytics.yahoo.com). Yahoo! Web 
Analytics was created by IndexTools, a lead­
ing provider of Web analytics software that 
was acquired by Yahoo!. Data is collected 
in “near” real-time, which means most data 
is available within minutes or seconds of a 
Web site visit. Yahoo! Web Analytics is free, 
offers customizable dashboards, segmenta­
tion tools for data analysis, and campaign 
management features similar to Google 
Analytics.
AWStats (http://awstats.sourceforge.
net). AWStats is a free, open source pro­
gram that you can install on your Web 
server. If you prefer to keep all your stats on 
your own server, you may prefer this option 
over Google Analytics and other online ser­
vices. This program generates advanced 
Web, streaming, FTP, or mail server statis­
tics with great graphics. Setting up AWStats 
is a bit more complicated than using a ser­
vice like Google Analytics because you need 
access to the Web server log files and spe­
cific scripts on your Web server. AWStats 
offers data similar to Google Analytics, but 
the presentation isn’t as nice.
Piwik (www.piwik.org). Piwik is a PHP/
MySQL software program that you down­
load and install on your own Web server. 
Piwik positions itself as the open source 
alternative to Google Analytics. Piwik takes 
about five minutes to install, and then you 
copy and paste JavaScript code on Web 
pages you want to track, much like you do 
with Google Analytics. The graphs, presen­
tation, and navigation of Piwik are more 
polished than AWStats, but still not as 
advanced as those at Google Analytics.

Designing a Blog
I
t was only a few years ago that blogs (short for Web log) were 
considered the wild and crazy new kid on the block. Next thing, 
it seemed like everyone had a blog. And most people didn’t seem 
to know why they had a blog — they just knew that everyone was 
saying that you had to have one.
After a few introductory posts to play with this new toy, statis­
tics from the blog search engine Technorati show that about 95 
percent of people abandoned them. And that’s a shame because 
blogging tools can be used for so much more than some lonely 
14-year-old’s gushing paean to sparkly vampires or a basement-
dwelling conspiracy theorist warning about alien mind-control rays. 
Savvy technology shoppers read blogs like Gizmodo (http://gizmodo.com) and 
Engadget (www.engagdget.com) to figure out if the newest techno-toy lives up to 
the hype. Dooce (http://dooce.com) and Suburban Turmoil (http://suburban
turmoil.blogspot.com) write about motherhood and child-rearing issues in a 
laugh-out-loud voice. Deadspin (http://deadspin.com) and Total Pro Sports 
(www.totalprosports.com/blog) cover the stories behind the stories on the 
sports page. 
At its heart, blogging software allows you to post information to the Web in a quick 
and easy way. After you have the blog set up, all you really have to do is type (into 
the right boxes) what you want the world to read, click to select multimedia assets 
(photos, videos, audio files), and click the Publish button. The blog displays the 
content in reverse chronological order, sorted by category or date, and allows 
readers to leave comments or trackback links to add to the discussion with the 
writer or other readers. The format of the site, after it’s set, doesn’t change. That 
is, you don’t have to choose how many columns of information you want, what the 
background color is, what the fonts are, or any of the other variables to designing 
a Web page.
In this chapter, I’ll demonstrate how to use WordPress, which is a sophisticated 
blogging tool that can grow with you as you get more comfortable with the 
blogosphere. WordPress is free to use, and comes in two “flavors.” You can get 
free hosting at WordPress.com, or you can download the software package from 
WordPress.org and install it on your own server. Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages. I start with the simplest approach of having someone else host 
it for you, and then take a look at how to take total control of things yourself.
Tasks Performed in

Your blogging software options are as numerous as the function keys at 
the top of your keyboard, so how do you choose one service over 
another — or know what they do in the first place? Although I can’t help 
you with your function keys, blogging software is another matter: One 
of the quickest and most flexible services is available at WordPress.com. 
WordPress has practically become the industry standard blogging tool 
in the last couple of years because the open-source community has 
dedicated itself to developing thousands of themes and plug-ins to 
allow blog owners to customize and extend the basic blog concept in 
almost infinite ways.
If you aren’t sure that you want to blog or you’re thinking of using other 
software down the road (or you’re just curious), WordPress.com is an 
excellent place to become familiar with how blogging software works, 
while offering you almost endless possibilities to expand beyond simple 
blogging to running a sophisticated e-commerce site or database-driven 
video-hosting service.
In this step-by-step task, you can see how easy it is to sign up for a blog 
and get started:
	1.	 Open your Web browser, point it 
to www.wordpress.com, and 
click the Sign Up Now button. 
	2.	  In the sign-up page, type the name you want to 
use in the Username field. This can be your 
name, an online identity (handle), or the name 
you would like for the blog. In this case, I used 
HollywoodBartender. Next, type a password. 
WordPress advises users to choose a password 
that mixes uppercase and lowercase characters 
as well as numbers and symbols. An example of 
this kind of mixture would be P@ssW0rd789. 
Retype the password in the Confirm box.
Toolbox:
✓	 An updated Web 
browser, such as 
Internet Explorer 8.0 or 
Firefox 3.5
✓	 An e-mail address

	3.	 In the next box down, type in your e-mail 
address. Like the online warning says, triple-
check that you have the spelling correct. If 
you ever forget your password, a new one 
will be e-mailed to this address. You can use 
your existing e-mail account; or, if you want 
to establish an entirely new identity just to 
deal with your blog, you can create a new 
e-mail identity at a free e-mail site. Make sure 
that the I Have Read and Agree to the 
Fascinating Terms of Service check box is 
selected. (Please click the link and do read 
the terms of service before agreeing to 
them.) Select the Gimme a Blog! radio 
button, and then click Next.
	4.	 This next page is where you pick your domain 
name and the title of your blog. You will need 
to think carefully and maybe try a number of 
options in this next step. Type in the domain 
name you want for your blog. This isn’t neces­
sarily going to be the name of your blog, but 
it should be as close to it as you can get. If 
your name is already in use by another blogger, 
you’ll be prompted to try another domain 
name. The default name here is the same as 
your Username. Try to keep this name short 
and sweet so that your readers can type it as 
easily as possible. In this instance, I chose 
to keep it the same as the Username, so the 
resulting URL for the blog is http://www.
hollywoodbartender.wordpress.com. 
Remember: Like the site says, after you choose 
this Web address, it can’t be changed. You can, 
however, start all over later if you come up 
with a genius idea for a domain name.
	
You have to remember your password, so don’t get too exotic with your made-up combinations just to please 
the strength bar. (The Password strength bar beneath the password entry box shows how your password sug­
gestion ranks in terms of un-guess-ability.) A password that rates as Good is probably enough for anything other 
than a banking/financial information site or a Department of Defense nuclear secrets site. 

226
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	7.	 Leave the Privacy check box selected if you 
want your blog to show up in search engines. 
(Um, clear the check box if you don’t want to 
be listed in search engines or WordPress.) 
However, clearing this check box doesn’t 
mean that your blog will be totally invisible 
and private — just that you’re not going out 
of your way to publicize it and try to drive 
traffic to it. Click the Signup button when 
you’re satisfied with your choices. 
Remember: After you click this button, you 
cannot change the URL: You can only start 
over and pick a new URL.
	6.	 Choose the language you will be 
blogging in. This list will set the 
default character set available for 
your text. That is, if you’re going 
to blog in Hindu or Farsi, choose 
that language so the characters 
show up how they’re supposed to 
(rather than appearing as blank 
spaces and random punctuation).
	5.	 In the next box down, give your blog a name in 
the Blog Title field. Most people try to come up 
with something memorable. Unlike the URL, you 
can change and tweak the blog title later. In this 
case, I wanted to build on the words Hollywood 
Bartender that appear in the URL, so the blog 
title is “The Secret Life of a Hollywood 
Bartender.”

227
 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
	8.	 WordPress sends a message to the e-mail 
account you entered. Go to your e-mail inbox 
and check for the message. You must click 
the link in the message (or cut and paste it 
into the browser navigation bar) to activate 
your blog. It may take up to 30 minutes for 
the confirmation message to arrive, so be 
patient if it doesn’t show up immediately. 
However, you must confirm this activation 
e-mail within two days, or WordPress will 
assume that you entered an incorrect e-mail 
address and then delete your blog.
	9.	 If you haven’t received your confirmation 
e-mail yet, scroll down to see some other 
options. You can click Contact Support, or 
re-enter your e-mail address. When you do 
click the link that you receive in your e-mail, 
you are taken to a page that says Your 
Account is Now Active! Your username and 
password should already appear in the 
blanks on that page.
	10.	You are prompted to update your profile. 
You can do this now, or get back to it later. 
If you want to do it now, enter your first and 
last name, and write a short description 
about yourself and why you are blogging. 
Click the Save Profile button after you’re 
done. Don’t worry — you can go back and 
change it if you later don’t like it. You will be 
taken to the Login screen.
	
If you have not received your e-mail verification message, be sure to check your spam filters.

228
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	11.	 If the fields in the Login screen aren’t filled 
in, enter your username and password; then 
click the Log In button. You can select the 
Remember Me check box if you’re on your 
own computer and want to have it fill in the 
blanks for you.
	12.	 When you login, you will be taken 
to the Dashboard. This is where 
you have an overview of all the 
controls you can use on your 
blog. Start by customizing your 
template, which is the focus of 
the next task.

229
 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
Blogging software options
I talk extensively about WordPress in this 
chapter, but it is by no means the only 
blogging solution out there. If a blog is an 
important part of your Web plans, spend 
time researching the available solutions to 
find the one that fits both your plans and 
your pocketbook.
Here are two other hosted solutions you 
can take a look at:
TypePad, at www.typepad.com, has three 
pricing levels, depending on the level of 
functionality you want. TypePad is proving 
to be the platform of choice for busy pro­
fessionals who want the convenience of 
a hosted service with more support and a 
larger feature set.
Blogger is Google’s blogging software. 
If you already have a Gmail account, you 
can use Blogger. Like WordPress, it’s free. 
Although it’s quite easy to use, it doesn’t 
have as many plug-ins and features as 
WordPress offers. Sign up for Blogger at 
www.blogger.com.
If you want to install software on your own 
Web server, here’s a description of the 
major players:
Movable Type is the granddaddy of blog­
ging software, the gold standard to which 
all others are compared. It has tons of help­
ful features, and if you develop the proper 
skills, you can make this software jump 
through hoops for you. Check it out at www.
movabletype.com.
Joomla! is an extremely powerful and 
extensible content management system 
(CMS). This program offers far more than 
just blogging tools and is great for online 
magazines and other complex sites. 
Joomla! is also increasingly used by many 
power bloggers. They point out that you 
can’t beat the features it offers for the price: 
it’s free. This software is open source, so 
many plug-ins, extensions, and themes are 
available. If you plan to build a blog that 
can hold up under heavy traffic, or that can 
be customized to do things beyond what 
a normal blog can handle, this excellent 
choice is available at www.joomla.org.
ExpressionEngine, at www.expression
engine.com, has its roots in blogging soft­
ware but is evolving into a fully featured 
CMS with excellent blogging tools. Throw 
in extras like photo galleries, shopping cart 
modules, forums, polls, and great customer 
support, and you can use this product to 
run your blog and some of the biggest and 
most complex Web sites on the Internet.
I mention only these blogging options 
here, but you can check out dozens, includ­
ing many on social networking sites like 
MySpace or Facebook. Carefully consider 
your needs, as well as what you might like 
to do in the future as you make your deci­
sion to find just the right set of features for 
your situation.

230 Part III: Going Web 2.0 
One of the greatest strengths of WordPress is the stunning number and 
variety of templates available. A template sets the look and feel of your 
blog: the size and position of the banner, the typefaces and font sizes, 
how many columns appear, what the comment system looks like, and 
much more. The templates help you show off photos, videos, music, 
and almost anything else you can upload to the Internet. You can create 
your own template with Web design tools, but to start, it might be best 
to play around with the free themes to get a feel for what the various 
design and blogging choices mean.
For example, a blog with only one big column works great for photogra­
phers wanting to show off their shots in the biggest possible format for 
maximum visual impact. A blog with multiple narrow columns works for 
an organization trying to present multiple threads of complex informa­
tion: say, a school that offers parents a way to see a calendar of events, 
the school lunch menu, and a recap of the last PTA meeting.
You can spend hours browsing through all the possibilities available 
for free on WordPress.com. Also hundreds of designers are willing and 
eager to sell you customized templates that use Flash, Silverlight, and 
other multimedia technologies to make your blog stand out from the 
crowd. 
	1.	 Log in to your WordPress 
account. On the Dashboard 
page, scroll down until you see 
the Appearance drop-down 
list. Click the Appearance 
button to open up that menu.
	2.	 Under Appearance, click Themes to navigate 
to the directory of free themes available 
through WordPress. You can scroll through 
multiple pages to find one that suits you. 
Click the thumbnails to open a window 
showing a mock-up of what your blog would 
look like. When you find a design you like, 
click Install to make that your template. 
Note: You can always change your template 
later.

	3.	 I’m using a theme called 
MistyLook as an example here 
because it offers a couple of easy-
to-control features and allows me 
to show off interesting widgets. 
After the theme is installed, it 
appears on top of your Manage 
Themes page. 
	4.	 Start the customization by working in the 
Header Image first. Click the Custom Header 
link. I prepared an image to replace the pic­
ture of the trees and bridge over the pond. 
You can use any photo-editing program to 
make a similar Header Image, as long as it 
fits in with the size requirements. In this 
case, you can crop an image to fit; or if you 
have one that’s 760 x 190 pixels, you can use 
it as is. Click the Browse button to navigate 
to where your image is stored. When you 
find it, click to select it and then click Open. 
Then click the Upload button.
	
You should settle on the general look and feel of your blog within the first week or so. Making too radical of a 
change after you create many blog posts can be problematic because of differing photo widths, font colors, and 
other elements that work great under one blog theme but can “break the page” when applied to another 
theme. For example, say your photo blog shows off some of your breathtaking landscape shots 800 pixels wide 
on a white background. Then you decide to switch to a 4-column blog where each column is only 200 pixels 
wide to show off more photos at a time, against a black background. Unless you re-size all the photos you’ve 
uploaded, your photos will either overlap and cover up your other content, or worse yet, the conflicting stan­
dards will cause your blog to refuse to load and visitors will see only an error message. And if you’ve specified 
that some of your text appear in black, it will be invisible against the black background unless once again – you 
guessed it – you go back into every blog post you’ve ever done and laboriously track down and adjust the 
custom text color. 

232
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	7.	 Under the Settings panel, click General. 
These settings control the title of your blog, 
the tagline, time zone, e-mail address, and 
other basic data. 
	6.	 Check out your new blog header. You can go 
back and edit the source picture if you’re not 
happy with the way it looks (using a photo-
editing program like Photoshop). Click My 
Dashboard (top of the window) to go back to 
the control panel to customize a couple 
other things about your blog’s appearance.
	5.	 You see a message that reads Header 
complete! Click the Visit Site button to see 
what your new blog header looks like.

233
 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
	10.	Click on the Dashboard button in the top 
left corner of the page to return to your 
Dashboard page, and scroll down to the 
Appearance panel. Click to open the 
Appearance panel if it’s not already 
open and then click Widgets.
	9.	 As you can see in the figure, I removed the 
distracting words above my nice new 
banner. Now it’s time to customize what 
appears in your sidebar(s). (You likely 
noticed by now those boxes running down 
the side columns, depending on your layout 
and the features that come with your 
template.)
	8.	 Because I customized the image to 
include the title of the blog, I’d like 
to get rid of the redundant words 
that appear above the banner. I 
clicked here and deleted the words 
that were in the Blog Title and 
Tagline text boxes. You can also 
use this page to change the title and 
tagline, if you want. Click in the text 
boxes to make your changes; then 
click Save Changes at the bottom of 
the page to make the changes take 
effect on your blog. Click Visit Site 
(up at the top of the page, next to 
the title of your blog) to see what 
the changes you have made look 
like. Your tagline can be a longer 
explanation of what your blog is 
about, a favorite quotation, a joke 
or you can go without one. 
	
Widgets are little pieces of code that make things happen on your blog, such as making your calendar appear, 
showing how many spam comments have been blocked, displaying photos that you have posted on other places 
around the Web, like Flickr.com, or letting your readers see your most recent Twitter updates.

234
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
12.	A four-pointed icon appears over the title bar 
to the widgets that you’re dragging. This means 
that you can drag the widget to your sidebar, 
or drag it out of your sidebar, if you don’t like 
how it looks or acts. You can also reorder the 
widgets by dragging them up or down in the 
sidebar. Some widgets will have boxes for you 
to fill in with information, such as the title 
you’d like to appear above your most recent 
posts, or the URL to a Flickr account. When 
you’re done making entries and you want to 
see how the new sidebar looks, click Visit Site 
at the top of the page.
	11.	You navigate to the Widgets control panel. 
Click a widget that you like and drag it to one 
of your sidebars. Hint: If you have multiple 
columns in your blog layout, you will have 
multiple sidebars to choose from.

235
 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
	13.	You see the new 
widgets as they 
appear in the side­
bar on your page. 
If you don’t like 
how they look, 
navigate back to 
the widget page 
and either adjust 
them or drag them 
out of your 
sidebar.
	14.	 In the Appearance box, click on Themes to navigate to the Manage Themes page. The 
last, and most complicated option for customizing your theme, is Edit CSS. This is 
most definitely not for beginners. You will need to purchase a Custom CSS upgrade, 
which will cost you about $15 per year per blog that you want to totally customize. 
With this option, though, you can control the fonts, colors, sizes, arrangements, 
line thickness — basically everything in your layout. You can make one change 
here without having to pay: setting the maximum width for media files in your blog 
so that pictures or videos don’t overflow your columns and mess up the look of your 
blog. If you are going to embed videos on your page, your columns should be at 
least 360 pixels wide. Most basic videos are 320 pixels wide. If you want to display 
higher-quality videos, they are 640 pixels wide, so your layout should be at least 680 
pixels wide, to allow some breathing room. The total width of your blog is up to 
you; but most Web designers try to keep their pages under 970 pixels wide so they 
display well on monitors set to a 1024x768 resolution. 

236 Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Updates to your blog are called posts, or entries. Blog posts are gener­
ally short (although they don’t have to be) and can be composed 
directly in the blogging software or written in more traditional word 
processing software and then pasted into the composition window. (For 
advice on creating a readable, interesting blog post, read the following 
sidebar, “Writing for your blog.”)
Nearly all blogging software works similarly to word processing soft­
ware, or even e-mail software. After typing an entry, you can use handy 
formatting icons in the publishing interface to create text styles. Blog 
software also has icons you can click to accomplish simple HTML tasks, 
such as inserting links, photos, or videos.
Creating a new post is easy to do. In fact, if you can write an e-mail mes­
sage, you can write a blog post! Follow these steps:
	1.	 Log in to your blog at www.wordpress.com. 
Scroll down to the Posts button and click it 
to open its drop-down list.
	2.	 Click Add New to open the 
Add New Post page.

	3.	 The Add New Post Page looks 
complicated, but after you work 
with it a few times, the basic func­
tions are pretty intuitive. First, 
write a snappy headline for your 
post. Click in the text field at the 
top of the page and type in a short 
description of what you want to 
say. Then press Enter (Windows)/
Return (Mac).

237
 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
	4.	 A URL and a couple of buttons appear below the 
headline text box. The URL, or Permalink, is the 
address where your post will appear when you 
finally publish it. You will see the Web address 
of your blog, followed by the date and the 
word(s) in your headline. You can click Edit to 
change the words in the Permalink if you want 
to make them different from your headline. Or, 
if you’re planning on sharing your post via 
e-mail, or social network sites like Facebook and 
Twitter, click Get Shortlink, and WordPress will 
automatically compress the post’s URL to a 
combination of letters and numbers.
	5.	 In the Upload/Insert area, type the text of your 
blog post, using the formatting icons to choose 
fonts, create lists and links, and customize other 
layout styles. Hint: To apply formatting to the 
text, select the text you want to affect, and then 
click the icon for the style you want to apply. You 
can choose font options, bold, italics, text color, 
text alignment, bulleted or numbered lists, special 
characters, and more. If you don’t see all these 
options, click the Show/Hide Kitchen Sink button 
on the far right or press Alt+Shift+Z (Windows)/
(Mac) to open what WordPress calls “The Kitchen 
Sink.” This is the second row of buttons that 
includes such functions as pasting from Microsoft 
Word (a handy feature that allows you to avoid 
contaminating your blog post with Word’s format­
ting), or designating something with the various 
Heading, Paragraph or Address tags.
	6.	 The five buttons at the top of the Upload/Insert 
area allow you to insert some very special con­
tent. From left to right, they allow you to add 
an image, insert video, add audio/music, add 
media (kind of a catch-all), or add a poll. 
Clicking each button opens a window that 
prompts you to choose files on your local hard 
drive, or that are at a URL on the Internet. 
WordPress does enforce some space limitations 
(3GB of content comes free, but you can 
upgrade to up to 25GB of storage) although it 
does offer upgrades where you can buy addi­
tional storage and bandwidth.
	
All kinds of considerations make writing a good headline for your post one of the most important things you do 
on a blog. Search engines pay special attention to the words in headlines, and a well-written description can 
help drive traffic to your blog. (Do a little research on search engine optimization as a primer.) Readers are also 
attracted to funny, shocking, or strange headlines — and Top 10 lists.

238
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	9.	 You can also add tags to your blog post. Tags are 
keywords that describe the blog post, and search 
engines pay special attention to tags so that they 
can better sort your content into search result 
listings. To add a tag, simply type it in the Add 
New Tag text box, just to the right of where you 
entered your post. Click the link below this box to 
choose from a list of tags that you frequently use 
so that you don’t have to spend time typing in the 
same old words over and over again. Click each 
tag, and it will appear under the Add New Tag 
box. Click on the gray “X” next to the tag if you 
made a mistake, and want to delete it. 
	8.	 To add a link, first select the text that you 
want readers to click to find the link. Then 
simply click the Link icon (the link of chain) 
or press Alt+Shift+A. When the URL window 
opens, copy and paste the Web address for 
the link into the window. Note: You need to 
use the full URL, including the http:// part, 
to create a working link.
	7.	 To insert an image into your blog 
entry, click the Add Image icon (looks 
like a rectangle inside another rectan­
gle). (To find out how to prepare 
images for use on the Web, read 
Chapter 5.) The Add an Image window 
appears, where you can choose from a 
handful of methods: Choose an image 
on your computer and upload it, pro­
vide the Web address (URL) for an 
image on another Web site, or add an 
image from your Media Library. Just 
click the tab you want at the top and 
follow the directions that appear on 
screen. 
	
The Media Library option is particularly handy if you want to add a company logo or other image to every post; 
you don’t have to keep uploading the same thing because WordPress allows you to navigate through your 
uploads and pick the one you want.

239
 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
	11.	Before you post your entry, click the Preview button, in 
the upper-right corner of the Add New Post page, to see 
how your chosen styles look. This opens another 
browser window with your post in it as it will look when 
it is published. You can return to Editing mode by clos­
ing this window. If you decide (after previewing) to 
remove formatting, simply highlight any element with a 
style you want to remove and click the Remove 
Formatting icon. (It looks like an eraser.)
	10.	Click the Check Spelling icon (looks like a check mark on top 
of the letters ABC) to have spelling errors underlined in red in

to work in by clicking on the triangle next to the ABC check­
mark button to open up the drop-down menu. You can then 
click on the language that you want spellcheck to operate in 
when checking the spelling in your post. Spellcheck will then 
underline words that are misspelled in that language. If you 
compose a post that uses words from a couple of languages 
and you’re not sure about the spelling, this feature can come 
in handy because you can spellcheck in one language and 
then do it again in another language.

button. The system then confirms that your post 
has been published. After you publish your post, 
click the Visit Site link at the top of the page, or 
View Post, to ensure that your post was pub­
lished successfully and looks the way you want.
14.	The Excerpt area allows you to 
choose what sentences or para­
graphs will appear in the RSS feed 
of your subscribers, or that will 
be weighted more heavily by 
search engines. You can either 
pick your best and most descrip­

what you have to say.
	13.	Click Add New Category in the Categories section. 
A text box opens where you can type in new catego­
ries, or select check boxes next to existing catego­
ries. This is a simple but powerful tool that allows 
your users to sort your blog posts based on catego­
ries that they are interested in, without them 
having to search through all your pages in chrono­
logical order to find the topics they are interested 
in. For example, a user who wants to see all the 
posts you’ve written that are Top 10 lists would 
click Top 10 under the Categories section of your 
blog to make your blog generate a page containing 
only posts that you have categorized as being Top 
10 lists – or related to Top 10 lists. 
	
You can assign multiple categories to your posts.  If you are writing about a piano-playing cat, for example, you 
can assign the post into the categories “cat,” “piano,” and “funny.” Then, when users come to your blog and 
want to see only posts that are cat-related, they can click on the “cat” category to zero in on only content that 
falls in that category. Another user wanting to read about pianos might click on the piano category, and your 
same post would appear in that list – along with posts about pianos that don’t include cats.

 Chapter 11: Designing a Blog
Writing for your blog
Blog style is generally conversational and 
informal in tone and style. You should 
address the reader directly to play up this 
aspect of blogging, almost as though you’re 
talking to a good friend on the phone or 
writing an e-mail message.
I don’t mean that you have to throw out the 
rules of grammar and spelling although 
many bloggers do so. You’ll find that many 
readers appreciate carefully crafted sen­
tences when they read blogs as much as 
they do when they read books. Why make 
yourself hard to understand?
Many writing coaches say that being rig­
orous about spelling and grammar is a 
good way to sharpen your thinking. And, of 
course, it’s true — the more attention you 
pay to writing well, the better your results, 
even if you’re just blogging about the ter­
rific play you saw last night, or the way your 
friends always seem to call just when you 
get in the shower.
Don’t forget that blogging doesn’t have to 
mean all writing, all the time. Many ter­
rific blogs are devoted to displaying a pho­
tograph every day, or to video blogging. 
Numerous others combine text, photos, 
audio, and video, which keeps them fun 
and interesting for readers — and for the 
blogger.
	
If you’ve read other chapters in this book, chances are you learned quite a bit of HTML. If you feel comfortable 
using HTML, you can actually use it right in the blog post window of WordPress. (As with regular text, you can 
write HTML directly in the window, or create your code in another application and copy and paste it into the 
blog post window.) If you want to use code, click the HTML tab of the composition window to switch from 
Visual mode.
	
After your blog is up and running, you can make updates by using e-mail. Updating in this way requires you to 
set up a special e-mail address that you are urged to keep secret. From the WordPress Dashboard, click the 
MyBlogs link and then click the Enable button under the Post-by-Email column. A special e-mail address will pop 
up in that column. Click the drop-down menu, choose Enable Post by Email, and then click Apply. Copy the 
e-mail address and save it in a secure location (such as a document on your computer’s hard drive). When setup 
is complete, simply cut and paste the e-mail address you just set up, choose a title by typing it in the Subject 
field, and then create a blog post in the body of your message. When you click Send, the message wings its way 
to WordPress and onto your blog.

242
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Promoting your blog
Many bloggers subscribe to the idea that,“If 
I publish it, they will come.” Let me be the 
first (or not) to burst that bubble: Blogs need 
to be promoted as much as any other Web 
site if you’re trying to appeal to an audience 
that doesn’t already know and love you. (Is 
it considered promotion when you e-mail 
everyone in your family to tell them about 
your blog?)
The good news is that at a very technical 
level, the setup of blogs helps them show 
up well in search engine results. And, of 
course, search engines love sites with fresh 
content, so a frequently updated blog truly 
has an edge over one that sees new content 
once in a blue moon.
Here’s a quick batch of things you should 
do to make the most of your new blog:
Ensure that your blog has an RSS or Atom 
feed. A feed is essentially a syndication 
mechanism for your blog: a coded presen­
tation of your updates that can be picked 
up and read by newsreaders, feed aggrega­
tors, and blog search engines, which in turn 
pass whatever they receive from the feed 
to humans visiting other Web sites. The 
result: eyeballs on your content and links to 
your blog. Most blog software can gener­
ate automatic feeds, but you should ensure 
that the feature is turned on and function­
ing. (WordPress automatically generates an 
RSS feed.)
Turn on trackbacks and pings. Trackbacks 
are a little hard to describe, but I’ll try: 
Essentially, a trackback is a way for blog 
software to communicate in the background 
and build links to other blogs. It goes like 
this: Blogger A posts interesting material on 
his blog. Blogger B reads that post, and has 
more to say about the same topic on her 
blog. Using the trackback URL on Blogger 
A’s post, Blogger B’s blog software noti­
fies Blogger A’s software about the new 
post. Blogger A’s software then automati­
cally builds, in the original post, a link to the 
new post. At the end of this (alphabet soup) 
process, Blogger A’s readers see the link to 
Blogger B’s post and visit her site to read it.
Pings work similarly but are basically a 
“heads-up” notification service sent to 
some of the bigger blog search engines 
and indexers. When you let these Web sites 
know that your blog has been updated, 
your listings are included in the results that 
are displayed the next time someone per­
forms a search, and again, more readers are 
directed to your site.
Many blog software packages offer both 
trackbacks and pings, and by simply turn­
ing on these settings, you receive the ben­
efit with little to no work each time you post 
to your blog.
Remember that your blog posts are an 
important part of promoting yourself. 
Keep the material you write interesting and 
topical. For example, if you choose to blog 
about a subject that’s in the news head­
lines, you can attract readers who might 
never have visited your blog otherwise. 
Keep track of what’s going on in the world, 
and think about how you can relate your 
topic to the broader context of discussion in 
the blogosphere.
Use social media to alert friends and col­
leagues. One of the best ways to keep 
people coming back to your blog is to 
remind people who already know you on 
Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, hi5, Beebo and 
other sites, that you have produced some­
thing new and interesting. This is where the 
shortened URLs often come in handy. You 
can also integrate material that you or your 
friends post on these sites into your blog, 
via the handy RSS feeds that every social 
networking site maintains.

Chapter 12
Podcasting Your Own Show
I
f you haven’t been hiding in a cave on Mars, you’ve prob­
ably already heard the term podcasting. It’s one of the hotter 
Internet buzzwords of recent years, and many people have scram­
bled like mad to incorporate podcasts onto Web sites.
The techie explanation is that a podcast is any audio file stored on 
the Internet that can be downloaded and played later on either a 
computer or a portable device. In real terms, a podcast is a radio 
show that you can take anywhere on a portable device, such as 
an iPod, or play on any computer that’s connected to the Internet. 
Podcasts are better than radio programs because you can start, stop, and rewind 
whenever you want. You can play them any time, anywhere. Podcasts enable you 
to connect with your site visitors or community through music or talk or both, 
enriching the experience or content your site has to offer. You find examples of 
how sites put podcasting to use in the nearby sidebar “Who’s podcasting?”
A good podcast can consist of a live interview that’s available to listeners for as 
long as a Web site hosts it, a lecture by a Nobel prize-winning professor that stu­
dents can use to help them study, or the wail of a newborn infant taking her first 
breaths. A podcast can be a long-winded blogger’s rant that will be heard only by 
a close circle of fans, or a stirring national address that will be cherished by an 
entire nation.
Podcasting is limited only by your imagination. As with so many other topics, a 
library of books could be filled with the bottomless depths of technical specifica­
tions that can be involved in recording, editing, and posting a podcast. Fortunately, 
you don’t need to know all that to get started. In this chapter, you find the most 
basic, cost-effective way to produce a professional-quality podcast, using free and 
easily available tools and programs.

Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Preparing a Podcast
Be sure to take the time before you record your podcast to plan what you want to 
say and how you want to say it. Even trained on-air personalities rarely try to make 
live, improvisational recordings. After a few minutes, an interviewer who doesn’t 
have at least an outline or some good questions for a guest runs out of things to 
say, and the session can turn into a nightmare of “um” and “uh.”
You don’t have to strictly follow a script, however, and stick to every little comma 
and pause. One thing that makes listeners respond and come back for more is the 
feeling that you’re talking to them rather than at them (like a late-night infomercial). 
And, one of the most difficult challenges I can imagine is to make yourself sound 
natural and relaxed while giving a monologue.
Who’s podcasting?
This list briefly describes some of the 
groups of people who are podcasting 
nowadays:
Musicians who want to connect with fans 
and promote their bands: Some forward-
thinking bands use podcasts to share 
excerpts from live shows, hype concert 
tours, and reward fan club members with 
exclusive content.
Families who want to remain connected 
across distances: Recordings of a baby’s 
first words, grandpa’s story time, or a rau­
cous family reunion aren’t proper substi­
tutes for being there, but they can at least 
allow people to get a flavor for what they 
missed.
Amateur DJs and novice broadcasters who 
want to show off their skills: A tight, well-
produced podcast can be an invaluable call­
ing card to a beginner hoping to take the 
next step up the career ladder.
Companies that provide training and man-
agement updates, especially to employ­
ees in far-flung offices: One of the fastest-
growing usages of multimedia is corporate 
communications. CEOs use podcasts to 
reach out to customers and reassure them 
in tumultuous times, and HR managers 
find spoken-word explanations of the latest 
change in corporate strategy that show up 
in employees’ e-mail inboxes helps main­
tain consistent corporate culture, and adds 
the kind of “human touch” that relaxes and 
reassures employees.
Churches that make their weekly sermons 
available: Congregation members who are 
ill or traveling or who otherwise can’t physi­
cally attend church can still hear the weekly 
services.
Bloggers who want to augment their 
content: Audio clips from interviews are 
increasingly popular, as are stream-of-con­
sciousness rants that provoke controversy 
and build up page traffic.
Radio producers and other professionals: 
Many excellent radio programs that are 
now available online as podcasts ensure 
that you never miss your favorite show. 
Listening to professional podcasts is one of 
the best ways to get new ideas for how best 
to create your own.

245
 Chapter 12: Podcasting Your Own Show
A good place to start as you plan a podcast is to think about creating a distinct begin­
ning, middle, and end. A good show usually starts with some kind of introduction of 
the host and any guests, moves on to the main topic, and then concludes with a tease 
to the next show you plan to produce. This outline for a music podcast gives you 
some ideas for what you might include — make your outline as detailed as you like:
	
1.	 Play an introductory music clip.
	
2.	 Greet the audience, introduce yourself, and state the number or date of the 
podcast.
	
3.	 Briefly explain the theme or topic of the podcast.
	
4.	 Mention any guests or special announcements.
	
5.	 Play new songs.
	
6.	 Provide any necessary additional explanation of the theme or topic.
	
7.	 Play more new songs.
	
8.	 Sum up the theme or topic.
	
9.	 Say goodbye, and “tease” the topic of the next podcast.
	
Although a podcast can theoretically last for hours, in practice, large audio files 
become unwieldy very quickly. Listener patience isn’t infinite, either, so unless you 
have an absolutely fanatical audience, limit your podcasts to a half-hour or less. 
Some of my favorite podcasts are only two to five minutes long, and they’re designed 
so that you can listen to as many in a row as you like. If you have a ton of material, 
breaking it up into smaller chunks is definitely the way to go.
The many ways to record sound
An increasing number of portable devices 
have audio-recording capabilities. Most 
smartphones record audio, laptops have 
built-in microphones, and MP3 players 
either record or use after-market add-ons. 
Professional radio reporters have long used 
minidisc recorders to capture high-quality 
audio, whereas some old-school podcasters 
just use cables to hook tape recorder head­
phone output into their computers’ micro­
phone input.
Podcasters are increasingly conducting 
interviews or round-table discussions using 
Internet telephone services like Skype or 
Vonage. These Voice over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) services allow users to digitally 
record conversations without having to 
resort to recording conversations over plain 
old telephone lines (and entangling them­
selves in wires and iffy legal ground).
However, because VoIP conversations are 
monaural and most listeners are used to 
high-quality stereo, podcasters are using 
workaround methods to conduct interviews 
over the phone. For example, each party to a 
conversation simultaneously records it into 
a high-quality stereo microphone. Then, at 
the end of the interview, both parties edit 
and clean up the audio, e-mail their audio 
file to each other, and then stitch together 
the files to get both (or more) sides of the 
conversation.
Even if you can’t get high-quality recordings 
of both ends of a conversation, the host 
should record into a microphone even while 
the rest of the conversation is recorded over 
a phone line or VoIP connection.

Recording a Podcast
Recording an audio file can be as simple as speaking into the micro­
phone on a computer headset or as complicated as setting up a dozen 
high-end microphones and a mixing board to get clean sound from 
every instrument in a chamber orchestra. Either way, the basic princi­
ples I cover in this chapter are the same.
Many audio professionals believe that the most important link in the 
chain is this first one: that using a bad or inappropriate microphone 
taints the audio from the get-go. The old computer industry axiom 
“Garbage in, garbage out” applies here as well. The good news is that 
quality microphones are more affordable than ever, and a microphone 
that costs less than $100 online or in a basic electronics store fulfills all 
but the most demanding needs. The bottom line: You can use your com­
puter’s built-in microphone, but a good external mic provides better 
sound quality.
A simple option is to record directly into your computer, which is easy 
enough because most newer computers sport a microphone port. (It’s 
usually red or pink and located next to the green port where you plug in 
headphones.) An even simpler option is to use a USB microphone. 
Although USB microphones aren’t ideal for recording music, they are a 
snap to use and configure, and often come integrated into headphones, 
making it easy to record while also monitoring sound. Whatever you 
choose, just plug in a mic and then follow these steps to start recording.
	1.	 Launch a sound-recording program, 
such as Audacity, as shown here. 
You find a list of some of the more 
popular software choices in the side­
bar at the end of this step list. I chose 
Audacity for this chapter because it 
has enough features to empower 
beginners to produce decent-
sounding podcasts, it works on both 
Macintosh and Windows computers, 
and it’s free. (You can download it at 
http://audacity.sourceforge.
net and use it to follow along with 
this task. If your copy of Audacity is a 
different version, you might see 
minor screen differences.)
	
Before you begin recording, make sure that neither the computer nor the microphone is muted. This advice 
sounds simple, but even seasoned professionals can tell stories about apparently recording beautiful sounds, 
only to find (too late!) that their files contained silence.

Need to Know

 Chapter 12: Podcasting Your Own Show
	
Many beginners erroneously assume that louder is better when recording. Like a teenager with a new car stereo, 
they want to crank the noise to 11 on a scale of 10. If you record with the volume set to its highest level, you 
get distortion — or worse, listeners unsubscribing from your podcast feed.
	2.	 Don’t be overwhelmed by the mass of buttons, 
bars, menus, icons, and level meters that make 
up this program. In the upper-left area of the 
workspace, under the menu bar, are some famil­
iar buttons: left to right, you’ve got Skip to Start, 
Play, Record, Pause, Stop, and Fast Skip to End. 
If your microphone is ready to record, just click 
the red Record button (the one with the big red 
circle) and say something into the microphone. 
(Sing a song, recite a poem, or act like you’re 
creating your first radio show!)
	3.	 As you record, you see the sound represented as a spectrum across an audio track. 
Notice the two volume meters in the top-right corner of the workspace: The one on the 
left (the little speaker icon) shows the playback volume; the one on the right (the micro­
phone icon) shows the volume of the microphone you’re using to record. Under the 
volume controls, the drop-down menu enables you to pick from a list of sources, includ­
ing microphone, line-in, aux(iliary), CD player, or stereo mix. Click the Stop button to 
stop recording, or click the Pause button to pause. (Be aware that Audacity will auto­
matically rearrange the position of the various buttons and control panels, depending 
on how you size the window. So if your screen shows the buttons in one row, two rows 
or whatever, click and drag on the handle in the lower right corner of the screen to 
make your window match the screenshots here.)

248
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	4.	 When you’re done recording, click 
the Stop button. Then click the Play 
button to play back what you 
recorded. Use the volume controls 
to adjust the playback sound. 
Remember: Make sure you click the 
Stop button and not just the Pause 
button. With the recording set to 
Pause, you won’t be able to play it 
back or to save it.
	5.	 To save the recording, choose File➪Save 
Project and then name your file. This step 
saves your sound file in an Audacity format 
(.aup) and preserves your recording in the 
best format for editing in Audacity. To create 
a new file in Audacity, choose File➪New, and 
you’re ready to start recording again in a 
new window. 
	6.	 When you’re ready to publish your recording to the 
Web, use Audacity’s export features. To export an 
Audacity file, choose File and then choose from any of 
the export options: WAV, MP3, or Ogg Vorbis. If you plan 
to publish your recording on the Web, your best option 
is MP3. Choose File➪Export As MP3 and name your file. 
Congratulations! You just took the first step toward 
having your own podcast. In the next task, you find 
instructions for editing a podcast.

Audio recording programs
The programs you can use to record and edit 
sound files range from free to quite expen­
sive, depending on the level of control you 
want and whether you want to be able to 
compose original music. This list describes 
some of the most popular programs among 
podcasters and audio editors:
	✓	 Audacity: This popular audio-editing 
program has more than enough fea­
tures to produce a great-sounding pod­
cast, and it’s available for Mac, Windows, 
and Linux systems (which is why it’s 
featured in this book). Audacity is free.
	✓	 GarageBand: 
Included 
on 
new 
Macintosh computers (OS X only), 
GarageBand is used by many podcast­
ers who are looking for a quick and auto­
mated solution that’s easily integrated 
with iTunes. GarageBand is free.
	✓	 Adobe Soundbooth: A more powerful 
and 
professional 
editing 
tool, 
Soundbooth comes bundled with other 
media programs in the Adobe CS4 suite. 
Soundbooth is aimed at people who 
want to be able to control a few aspects 
of their sounds but want menus with 
simple, easy-to-understand choices. 
Solo, the program costs $199 and has a 
free 30-day trial period.
	✓	 Adobe Audition: You can use this tool, 
intended for full-fledged audio engi­
neers, to compose music and adjust and 
filter voices using complex and exacting 
processes. It costs $399 and has a free 
30-day trial period.
	✓	 Propaganda: Propaganda is designed to 
help record and distribute podcasts. 
Although it has simplified sound-editing 
tools, you can preview your recording 
on your iPod or mobile device, and it 
writes the RSS code for you. Propaganda 
costs $49 and has a free 30-day trial 
period.
	✓	 SnapKast: SnapKast ($79) bills itself as a 
“one-click” podcasting solution that not 
only records and edits sounds but also 
creates RSS and handles the uploading 
and syndication chores.
	✓	 MyPodcast Recorder: Offered as a free 
download from MyPodcast.com, this 
simple recorder offers one-click installa­
tion and a very stripped-down interface. 
The drawback is that you have to put up 
with its ads on the site as well as the ads 
that are inserted into your final 
podcast.
	
If you’re prompted to install the file lame_enc.dll to complete MP3 encoding, just return to the 
http://audacity.sourceforge.net site and search for “lame_enc.dll” to find the necessary 
file and simple instructions for downloading and selecting it in Audacity.

Editing a Recording
In this task, you perform basic sound editing to clean up a recording. 
You don’t have to use editing tools. In fact, some podcasters wear their 
rough-and-scratchy recordings as badges of honor as proof that they’re 
part of an insurgent media that rejects (what they perceive as) smooth, 
polished, and fake corporate style. If this is your ethos, then by all 
means, don’t edit your sound files.
Most people, however, prefer to listen to recordings that don’t sound 
like they were made in a gravel-sorting machine. And, if you ever ven­
ture into the field to do interviews or record your child’s solo in the 
school play, you’ll probably need to fix the volume or noise level or the 
big, scratchy thud of Aunt Edna’s elbow knocking the microphone off 
the table.
Here are some basic sound-editing tips to help you reduce noise in your 
recordings, cut and paste segments, and normalize your recordings 
(make the too-soft parts louder and the too-loud parts softer). I encour­
age you to explore beyond these simple steps. 
	1.	 If your sound-recording program (such as 
Audacity, shown here) isn’t open already, 
launch it and then create a recording or open 
an existing one.
	
Most audio programs have tutorials and Help files to explain what all the arcane jargon means (although if you 
can explain to me under which circumstances I would want to use a Hilbert transformer rather than a Dyson 
compressor and a transient mangler, I’m all ears).

	2.	 To listen to the entire recording, click the Play 
button at the top of the workspace. You should 
hear your voice (or whatever you just recorded) 
playing back. Notice that every time you hear 
noise in the recording, you see a corresponding 
spike on the graph in the Audio track.
	3.	 To listen to a portion of the recording, click any­
where on the recording in the audio track area, 
and you will see a vertical dotted line appear 
across that portion of the recording. Click the 
Play button; the recording will start from the 
location of your marker on the track.
	4.	 You can rearrange or delete sections of sound to 
make a better or shorter recording. Each of the follow­
ing steps begins with selecting part of the sound file. 
Look in the small toolbox at the top of the workspace. 
(The toolbox has six tools, including Zoom and Time 
Shift.) Click the Selection Tool (which looks like an 
I-beam) to make it active before the next step.
	5.	 To delete a noise (such as a sneeze), 
click and drag to select that section, 
and then press the Delete key. Or you 
can choose Edit➪Delete, or press 
Ctrl+K (Windows)/Option+K (Mac). 
You can also delete “non-noise,” like 
a pause. Read more about this in the 
sidebar, “Getting rid of ‘dead air’.” 
You can easily recognize silence in 
the audio track by its flat line in the 
sound spectrum graph. To adjust 
the selection, click and drag on 
either side of the selected area to 
enlarge or reduce the selection.

	8.	 To hear the results of your editing, click to place the 
cursor where you want to begin playback, and then 
click the Play button.
	
To listen to only a particular section of the recording, click and drag to select the section and then click Play. 
You can then adjust the selection in the recording until you have just the part you want to cut, copy, or delete.
	6.	 To cut or copy a section of sound, click and 
drag to select the section in the audio track, 
and then choose Edit➪Cut (or Copy). Click 
and drag on either side of the selected area 
to enlarge or reduce the selection.
	7.	 To move the cut or copied sound to another 
part of the recording, click to place the cursor 
where you want to add the sound in the audio 
track, and then choose Edit➪Paste. The word 
or phrase is pasted into that point in the 
recording.

recording, you balance out the highs and lows, 
to make the overall volume more consistent. To 
apply the Normalize effect, select the part of the 
recording you want to apply it to and then 
choose Effect➪Normalize.
	9.	 Audacity includes many effects to improve 
or alter your sound recordings. To apply an 
effect, you must first select the part of the 
recording you want to apply it to. Click and 
drag to select a portion of the recording, or 
choose Edit➪Select➪All to select the entire 
open recording.
	11.	In the Normalize dialog box, mark both check boxes for 
default normalization. Click Preview to test how the 
effect will alter the sound of your recording. If you’re 
happy with the result, click OK to apply the effect.

	12.	Experiment with the effects, and remember 
that you can apply them to any selected part 
or all of the recording. Click Play to test your 
work, and if you don’t like the results of an 
effect, just choose Edit➪Undo to remove it.
	13.	When you’re done, choose File➪Save Project to save the recording in Audacity 
format. Then choose File➪Export to save the recording in a suitable format, 
such as MP3, before you publish your podcast to the Web.
Getting rid of “dead air”
Even with only the most basic understanding 
of audio editing, you can move a song from 
the beginning of your podcast to the end, or 
move the response to an interview question 
to the beginning, to use as a “teaser.”
Your goal should be to interest listeners 
immediately and then keep them interested. 
One of the best ways to do that is to delete 
all “dead air,” such as pauses and other 
quiet spots. This skill is essential for produc­
ing a tight, efficient podcast. Remember that 
listeners have lives too, and if you ask them 
to wait around for a couple of minutes while 
you fumble, they will become frustrated.
Some podcasters who are obsessed with 
deleting all the dead air between words 
review their recordings repeatedly, to 
shorten the spaces between words as 
much as possible. Although it’s sometimes 
helpful to remove the extra breaths and 
any instances of “um” and “uh” between 
sentences, if you go too far, your recording 
sounds like you drank too much coffee and 
are babbling like a tobacco auctioneer.
Try to strike a balance. You want your 
recordings to sound natural, like a conversa­
tion you’re having with your listeners (with 
all the boring parts cut out). Experience will 
gradually teach you the sweet spot.

Publishing a Podcast
How you publish your podcast depends mostly on where you plan to 
publish it.
In the early days of podcasting, sites offering to host your files for free 
were springing up all over. Unfortunately, some of the sites were used 
to facilitate music piracy. Multimillion-dollar lawsuits filed by the 
recording industry have caused many sites that hosted podcasts to 
drastically restrict their offerings, or go completely out of business. 
Gcast (www.gcast.com) is an intriguing site that’s still standing, offer­
ing not only free hosting for your podcast but also integrated access to 
podcast-safe music (that is, music you can use without getting into 
copyright trouble) at its sister site, www.garageband.com.
If you have a blog on one of the popular blogging sites, such as TypePad 
or Blogger, you find instructions and features designed to help you add 
a podcast almost as easily as you add a post.

services and other resources:

iPod.
	
✓	The Podcast Network: (www.thepodcastnetwork.com) This

Mixing in music
You don’t have to be a wannabe DJ to 
include music in your podcast. Even if 
you’re participating in hard-hitting inves­
tigative reporting or archiving your dad’s 
favorite fishing story, music can spice 
up the recording and make it seem more 
professional.
You can also add funny sound effects or 
snippets of dialogue from TV shows or old 
movies. Just make sure that you have the 
legal right to use any music or other type 
of recording. Type free music into any 
search engine to find places where you can 
download sound files. Be careful, however, 
because many of the sites that used to be 
free have started charging for the music, 
and don’t hit you with the fees until you try 
to download.
Here are a few sites where you can still find 
free music (or at least low-cost royalty-free 
music): Musicalley.com, GarageBand.
com, Netlabelindex.com, Magnatune.
com, CCmixter.org, SoundClick.com, 
and Freemusicarchive.org.
You can add a music track to a sound file in 
a program like Audacity by using the Import 
feature, listed on the Project menu. Adding 
a basic audio track isn’t difficult, but man­
aging all the format options, permissions, 
and settings can become complicated, 
and is well beyond the scope of this book. 
However, you’ll find many great books and 
online resources if you want to become more 
proficient in podcasting. One place to start is 
Expert Podcasting Practices For Dummies, 
by Tee Morris and Evo Terra (Wiley).

M
ake your Web pages sing and dance by adding audio, 
video, and other multimedia to your pages. If you want 
to provide a richer experience for your users, to show rather than 
just to tell, or to entertain as well as inform, add animation or 
video. Not only does multimedia help tell stories more vividly, it 
can also make you look more professional.
And adding animation or video isn’t as hard as you might think. 
One simple way to add video to a Web page is to upload a video 
file to YouTube (or search for video already on YouTube) and then 
insert it into your page. You find detailed instructions in this chap­
ter for using video on YouTube, Vimeo, and other video hosting 
and social networking sites. You also find step-by-step instructions 
for using Dreamweaver to insert Flash animations and videos in 
into your Web pages.
Perhaps the most complicated aspect of multimedia on the Web is choosing the 
best format for your audience, which is why this chapter starts with a primer on 
audio and video formats and how multimedia works on the Web today.
Playing Animation and Video on the Web
When you add video or any other kind of multimedia to a Web site, your visitors 
may need a special player to play your files. A player is a small program that works 
alone or with a Web browser to add support for functions such as playing audio, 
video, or animation files. Among the best-known multimedia players are Adobe 
Flash Player, Windows Media Player, and Apple QuickTime.
The challenge is that not everyone on the Web uses the same player, and your site 
visitors must have the correct player to view your multimedia files. If your visitors 
don’t have the right player, your video or animation file won’t be displayed at all. 
If your multimedia file can’t be displayed, you can include information on where to

Part III: Going Web 2.0 
download most players for free, but many visitors find these messages confusing or 
irritating. As a result, many Web developers help out by doing one or more of the 
following:
	
✓	Use Flash: By far the most widely used multimedia player, Flash supports 
video, audio, and animation. 
	
✓	Offer audio and video in two or three formats: For example, you can insert a 
video in the Flash format and then include links to the video in Windows Media 
Video and Quicktime so that visitors can choose the format that best fits the 
player they already have.
	
✓	The same multimedia files in different file sizes: Including multiple versions 
of the same video in different sizes enables visitors with slower connection 
speeds to get the video file faster, while still providing a higher quality version 
for visitors who do have high-bandwidth connections.
	
✓	Information about where to find the necessary player: It’s always good prac­
tice to include instructions about where visitors can download any player 
needed to view files, but keep in mind that won’t work for everyone. Many 
people surf the Web from offices, libraries, and other locations where they are 
unable to download and install new players (which is why choosing the popu­
lar Flash player or providing multiple versions are the safest options).
Comparing popular video formats
One challenge to working with video on the 
Web is choosing the best format. This list 
briefly describes the most common digital 
video formats and their file extensions and 
supplies a Web address where you can find 
out more about each program.
Flash Video: Because the Flash Player is so 
commonly used on the Web, many develop­
ers consider Flash one of the best options 
for sharing video on the Web. Videos can be 
converted into the Adobe Flash Video format 
(which uses the .flv extension) with the 
Adobe Media Encoder (www.adobe.com).
Windows Media Video: Developed by 
Microsoft and popular on PCs, Windows 
Media Video is another popular format 
which uses the .wmv extension. See www.
microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia.
QuickTime: The QuickTime video format, 
which uses the .mov extension, is popular 
among Macintosh users because the player 
is built into the Mac operating system 
(although QuickTime files can be viewed 
on Windows computers with the QuickTime 
player). See www.quicktime.com.
AVI: Created by Microsoft, the Audio Video 
Interleave (AVI; .avi) format is one the 
most common video formats on Windows 
computers, and it can play on most common 
video players. AVI works well if you’re view­
ing video on a CD or on your hard drive, 
where the file doesn’t have to be down­
loaded, but you can’t optimize AVI files well 
for use on the Internet. If your files are in 
AVI format, you should convert them to one 
of the other formats before adding them to 
your Web site. Otherwise, you force visitors 
to download unnecessarily large video files. 
You can find more information if you search 
for AVI at www.microsoft.com.

259
 Chapter 13: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
	
No matter which player and format you choose, I recommend that you
	
✓	Make it easy for people to turn off sound. Remember that many people surf 
the Web in libraries, offices, and other places where unexpected sound can be 
jarring, disruptive, or worse. If you get someone in trouble for surfing the Web 
in their cubical, they may never come back to your Web site. I recommend you 
always warn people before you play video or audio, and always provide a way 
to turn off the sound quickly and easily if necessary.
	
✓	Optimize your video for faster downloads. Optimizing multimedia for the 
Web works much like it does with images: the smaller the file size, the lower 
the quality but the faster the file download. One task in this chapter shows you 
how to optimize a video with the free Adobe Media Encoder.
Working with Adobe Flash
Most of the tasks in this chapter focus on techniques using the Flash video and anima­
tion formats because Flash has clearly emerged as one of the most popular technolo­
gies for creating animations as well as videos for the Web. Indicative of its popularity, 
YouTube converts videos into the Flash format for display on its Web site.
Flash animation files use the file extension .swf. Flash video uses the .flv exten­
sion. You can easily insert Flash animations and Flash videos into your pages using 
Dreamweaver.
	
Before you choose Flash, though, you should be aware of its few downsides:
	
✓	Flash isn’t supported by most mobile devices, including the iPhone and 
Blackberry. (Check the iPhone and Blackberry Web sites for updates as this 
may change in the future, but as of the writing of this book, if you visit a site 
built in Flash with an iPhone, you just get a blank page.)
	
✓	Flash doesn’t always print well. Many people like to print Web pages, espe­
cially pages that include instructions, directions, and other important refer­
ence material. If you include that information in a Flash animation which can’t 
be printed, consider including a simple XHTML version as an alternative.
	
✓	Flash can cause accessibility problems for visitors with disabilities unless you 
create an alternate text option for Flash files. Similarly, text included in Flash 
files isn’t easily read by search engines (although including alternative text 
can help with this limitation, too). You can add Alternative text to a Flash file 
in Dreamweaver by clicking to select the Flash file, and then entering a text 
description in the Alt field in the Property Inspector.
	
✓	Some people deliberately block Flash files because they’re often used for 
advertising or to create animated introduction screens that look pretty but 
don’t offer much value to site visitors. (You may want to describe what they’re 
missing.)
Despite these downsides, adding a little Flash video or animation can add a lot of 
life to your site. And, if you’re not designing your entire site in Flash, it’s generally a 
safe format choice for adding a little video, audio, or animation to your Web site.

  Inserting a Flash Animation File into a Web Page
Flash animation files are relatively easy to insert into a Web page when 
you use Dreamweaver. In this section, I assume that you have a com­
pleted Flash animation file and that you want to add it to your Web 
page. To create a Flash file, you need Adobe Flash or a similar program 
that supports the Flash format. (If you want to know how to create 
Flash files, check out Adobe Flash CS4 For Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein 
and Gurdy Leete, from Wiley.)
You insert a Flash file in much the same way as you insert an image file, 
but because Flash can do so much more than a still image, you choose 
from a variety of settings and options for controlling how your Flash file 
plays. Before you start, make sure to move or save the Flash file into the 
main root folder of your Web site (see Chapter 6 for detailed instructions 
about setting up a site in Dreamweaver and identifying the root folder). If 
you like, you can create a subfolder to store your Flash files inside your 
main site folder, just as you might create an images folder for images.
To add a Flash file to a Web site, first open an existing page or create a 
new document and save the file, and then follow these steps:
Stuff You Need to 
Know
	1.	 In Dreamweaver, click to insert the 
cursor where you want the Flash 
file to appear on your Web page. In 
this example, I’m inserting it into a 
div tag in the middle of the page. 
You can read more about div tags 
in Chapter 6.

261
 Chapter 13: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
	2.	 Choose Insert➪Media➪SWF from the menu. You 
can also choose Common from the Insert bar, if it 
isn’t already selected, and then choose SWF from 
the Media drop-down list. (Note, if you are insert­
ing a Flash video file, you would choose FLV.)
	4.	 If you haven’t turned accessibility options off in 
Dreamweaver’s Preferences dialog, you’re prompted to 
add alternative text to describe the Flash file. Enter a 
short description or name for the Flash file. Use of the 
Tab Index and Access Key options is optional. Leave 
these blank unless you want to include a special key 
command to control the file. Click OK; the dialog box 
closes, and the Flash file is inserted into your document.
	3.	 In the Select File dialog box that opens, browse 
your hard drive to locate the Flash file that you 
want to insert in your page, click to select the 
file, and then click OK. You can also double-click 
to select the file.
	
Because Flash is an open standard, you can create Flash files with a variety of programs, including Adobe 
Photoshop Elements (which uses the Flash format when you create Web galleries in Elements), and Adobe 
Illustrator (which has an Export to SWF option).

262
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	6.	 Click the Play button in the 
Property Inspector to play the 
Flash file. In this example, the Flash 
file is a dancing dog I purchased 
from iStockPhoto.com, so pressing 
the Play button causes the cartoon 
dog to dance on the screen. (Note: 
When the Play button has been 
activated, the button text changes 
to Stop.)
	7.	 Choose File➪Save to save the page. You’ll be prompted to also save the related 
script files. Dreamweaver saves the files into a folder named Scripts in your main site 
folder. Remember: You must upload this entire folder to your Web server for your 
Flash file to work properly when the page is published to the Web.
	5.	 Dreamweaver displays Flash as a 
solid, gray box that represents the 
width and height of the Flash file. 
Click the gray box to display the 
Flash options in the Property 
Inspector at the bottom of the 
workspace.

263
 Chapter 13: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
	8.	 You can make a number of adjust­
ments to the way a Flash file is dis­
played by changing the settings in 
the Property Inspector: for exam­
ple, Loop (replays the file if it’s an 
animation), Autoplay (causes the 
file to play as soon as the page is 
loaded into a browser), and Quality 
(controls how good the file will 
look, how fast it will play, and how 
long it will take to download).
	9.	 When you finish adding the Flash file to your 
page, choose File➪Save to save the page. 
You’ll be prompted to also save the related 
script files. Dreamweaver saves the files into 
a folder named Scripts in your main site 
folder. Remember: You must upload the 
entire Scripts folder, as well as the Flash file, 
to your Web server for your Flash file to 
work properly when the page is published to 
the Web.
Scripts to make Flash function better
When you insert Flash or other multimedia 
files with Dreamweaver, the program auto­
matically creates a JavaScript file that helps 
the file play automatically. The file, named 
AC_RunActiveContent.js, is stored in 
the Scripts folder, which Dreamweaver 
automatically creates inside your root site 
folder. The first time Dreamweaver creates 
this file, a dialog box alerts you that you 
need to upload the script in order for your 
multimedia file to work properly. Make sure 
to include this script (and the entire folder) 
when you publish your site on your Web 
server. If you don’t include it, your multi­
media file may not play properly, or visitors 
might be required to click the Play button 
twice before the file begins to play.

Converting and Optimizing Flash Video
You can convert video from one file format to another relatively easily 
by using most video-editing programs. For example, you can open a 
video in AVI format in a program such as Adobe Premier Elements (a 
good video editor for beginners) and then choose File➪Export to con­
vert the file to any of a dozen other formatting and compression 
options.
Editing video gets complicated, and optimizing video for the best qual­
ity with the fastest download time is both an art and a science. The 
most basic process of converting a video file isn’t difficult, however, 
after you understand the conversion options.
This task walks you through the process of converting a video file from 
Windows Media into Flash video (FLV), using the Adobe Media Encoder. 
In this task, I’m using the encoder that comes with Adobe CS4 Creative 
Suite. A very similar, but somewhat more limited version called the 
Flash Video Encoder is also included in Adobe CS3 Creative Suite. Both 
versions will work fine for this task.
	1.	 Launch the Adobe Media Encoder 
and click the Add button to load a 
video that you want to convert into 
a Flash video file. In this example, I 
added a short video clip that was 
saved in Windows Media Video 
(WMV) format, but you can add 
video in a variety of formats, 
including AVI, MP4, and QuickTime. 
Click the Settings button on the 
right side of the encoder to launch 
the Export Settings dialog box, as 
shown in the next figure.
Stuff You Need to 
Know

265
 Chapter 13: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
	2.	 In the Export Settings dialog box 
that appears, leave the Format set 
to FLV and then choose a Flash 
encoding profile from the Preset 
drop-down menu.
	3.	 You can choose from a long list of presets. 
The later the version of Flash and the 
larger the size, the better the video will 
look. However, a trade-off is involved: Not 
everyone has already downloaded the 
latest version and not everyone has a high-
bandwidth connection to the Internet. If 
you know many people who visit your site 
will be using older computers or have slow 
connections, you may want to use one of 
the lower presets.

266
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	5.	 Click the Audio tab to adjust the Bitrate and 
other options. If your audio file has only a 
single voice, you can set this option quite low, 
and it still sounds good. If your audio file has 
music, special sound effects, or other multifac­
eted audio factors, set the Bitrate to at least 
128 Kbps.
	4.	 Click the double arrows to access Advanced Mode for more specific settings if you want 
to change any preset options, such as Frame rate, which you can find under the Video 
tab. To achieve the fastest download time, set the frame rate to the lowest setting that 
still looks good. If you’re encoding a video that has lots of action, you need a higher frame 
rate — ideally, 24 or better — or else your video loses details and looks fuzzy in places. If 
you’re converting a video, such as this Windows Media file that has already been encoded, 
your best option is to choose Same As Source from the preset drop-down list and leave 
the frame rate unchanged.

267
 Chapter 13: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
	6.	 Choose the Others tab to enter FTP options; 
then you can upload video files to a server 
directly from the encoder. When you have all 
the settings the way you want, click OK. The 
Export Settings dialog box closes, and you 
return to the encoder.
	7.	 After you have everything adjusted, you’re ready to begin 
the encoding process. Click the Start Queue button. Hint: 
The encoding process can take several minutes, even for a 
short video file. A small preview window in the lower-right 
corner of the encoder enables you to watch the encoding 
process in action. A new file is created in the Flash format 
and is saved in the same folder as the original video file.

Adding Flash Video to Your Site
Flash video is fast becoming the video format of choice among many design­
ers. Video on the Web has been problematic for a long time because many 
different formats are available and you can never guarantee that everyone 
in your audience can view your videos in any single format.
Although the video players have been fighting it out for years, Flash 
seems to be winning the game. YouTube offers videos in the FLV Flash 
video format and millions of people have the Flash player on their com­
puters because it’s small, easy to download and install, and free.
Because Adobe owns both Flash and Dreamweaver, you find support for 
Flash files in Dreamweaver. You can use the Insert dialog box to easily set 
the many options for how a Flash video plays within a Web page. In the pre­
vious task, you find instructions for converting a video file into the Flash 
format. Follow these steps to insert a Flash video file into a Web page:
	1.	 Create a new Web page in Dreamweaver or open 
an existing page, and then click to place your 
cursor where you want the file to appear on the 
page. Select Common from the Insert panel; 
then, from the Media drop-down list, choose 
FLV for Flash Video. (You can also choose 
Insert➪Media➪Flash Video from the menu.)
	2.	 At the top of the Insert FLV dialog box that 
appears, specify streaming or progressive. Note 
that you must have special server software to 
stream video. Check with your Internet hosting 
service or system administrator to find out 
whether your Web server supports streaming 
Flash files. If not, select Progressive. Click the 
Browse button and select the Flash file from your 
hard drive. If the file isn’t in your site’s root 
folder, Dreamweaver offers to copy it there for 
you. Remember: The Flash file must be in your 
site’s main root folder and it must be uploaded 
to your Web server in the same relative location 
when you upload the page that displays the file.

	3.	 Next you choose a Skin, which creates a player, or 
Flash controller, for your video. The Skin drop-
down list includes a variety of Play, Pause, Stop, 
and Volume controls in different sizes and designs 
that can be inserted into the page with the Flash 
file. When you choose a skin from the drop-down 
list, a preview of the selected skin is displayed, as 
shown here, so you can see the size and style of 
the Flash controller.
	4.	 Click the Detect Size button; Dreamweaver auto­
matically inserts the height and width of the Flash 
file into the HTML code. If you want the Flash video 
to play as soon as the page is loaded, select the 
Auto Play check box. To automatically rewind the 
video after it has played, select the Auto Rewind 
check box.
	5.	 Click OK to insert the Flash file and 
close the dialog box. The Flash file is 
represented in the Web page by a 
box that has the same height and 
width of the video. Click the box 
that represents the video to select 
it. You can make further adjust­
ments to the settings in Property 
Inspector at the bottom of the work­
space. Click to select the Flash file 
to display the Flash properties, such 
as size, autoplay, and loop. 

270
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	7.	 When you insert a Flash video file and include a skin for the player, 
Dreamweaver creates a Flash file with the .swf extension and saves it in 
your root site folder. This Flash file contains the player controls. It must be 
uploaded to your Web site when you publish the page with the Flash file 
for the player controls to work on your Web site. In this figure, the file 
named Clear-Skin_3.swf contains the Flash controller.
	6.	 To view the Flash video, preview the page 
in a Web browser by choosing File➪Preview 
in Browser and then choosing any browser 
from the menu. You must have the Adobe 
Flash Player installed on your computer in 
order to view the Flash video in your Web 
browser. (Note that the Flash controller, 
created by the skin, becomes visible only 
when you roll your cursor over the bottom 
of the video.)

Uploading Videos to YouTube, Vimeo, 
and Other Sites
YouTube has attracted a tremendous amount of attention in recent 
years as the place to find Web videos. You can upload your own videos 
to www.youtube.com for all the world to see (a great way to garner 
free promotion), and use the site to host videos. So why not host your 
videos on your own Web server? Because bandwidth costs money, 
especially if you get lucky enough to get millions of visits to your video. 
YouTube, Vimeo, and others also provide streaming video hosting, 
which many Web hosts charge extra for (or don’t provide at all). After 
videos are uploaded to a site like YouTube, you can then embed them 
so that they play within a page in your site. The result is that visitors 
see your video on your site, but you don’t have to pay for premium 
bandwidth.
If you want the greatest possible audience to view your videos, I recom­
mend YouTube. If you want more control over the use of your videos 
and how they’re displayed in your pages, the premium service at Vimeo 
is a great option. Other video hosting services include Photobucket, 
Google Videos, and Revver, which offers advertising revenue for videos 
that attract a large audience.
As you see in this short task, YouTube makes it easy to upload videos 
and then embed them into your Web pages. Vimeo and other services 
are similar. The good thing is that most videos can easily work within 
those parameters. If your video is ready to post, follow these steps:
Stuff You 
Need to Know
	1.	 Before you can upload videos, 
you must first register at 
YouTube, a free and relatively 
painless process that simply 
requires filling out a form on 
the site.

273
 Chapter 13: Multimedia: Adding Flash, Audio, and Video
	2.	 To upload a video you must first log in, then 
click the Upload link in the upper-right 
corner of any YouTube page, and then use 
the Browse button to locate the video file 
you want to upload from your hard drive. Fill 
in the fields in the upload form to describe 
the video and add keywords to make it easier 
for YouTube visitors to find your video when 
they search the site.
	3.	 When uploading is complete, YouTube displays a confirma­
tion page that includes HTML code you can add to your 
own Web site or blog to display your video on your own 
site. You can even choose the size and other display set­
tings. To link to a video on YouTube, copy the URL and 
create a link in Dreamweaver like you would to any page on 
the Web. If you want to embed the video so that it plays 
within a page on your site, click and drag to select all text in 
the Embed box and then press Ctrl+C to copy it.

Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Choosing YouTube versus Vimeo
Vimeo offers a free service, similar to 
YouTube, and also provides a reasonably 
priced premium service ($69 per year at the 
time of this writing). Vimeo’s premium serv-
ice enables you to embed videos as easily 
as you can from YouTube, but with more 
options for how the video is displayed. For 
example, with Vimeo’s premium service, 
you can remove the Vimeo icon from the 
player and remove any mention of related 
videos on the Vimeo site. You can also pre­
vent other people from embedding your 
video on their sites.
YouTube is free, but when you upload your 
videos to YouTube, you give up some rights 
to your content. (Read the agreement at 
YouTube.com for more details about copy­
right and other legal issues.) Also, you can 
only upload videos that are smaller than 
100MB and take fewer than 10 minutes 
to play. According to the site: “YouTube 
accepts video files from most digital cam­
eras, camcorders, and cell phones in the 
.WMV, .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG file formats.” 
You can also upload files in the Flash video 
format.
	4.	 To add the code to your Web page in 
Dreamweaver, click the Split View button at the 
top of the workspace to view the HTML code of 
any page, click to place the cursor in the code 
wherever you want the video to be displayed, 
and choose File➪Paste to insert the code you 
copied from YouTube. (You find more detailed 
instructions for adding code from sites like 
YouTube in Chapter 6.)
	5.	 Choose File➪Preview in Browser and then select any 
browser you have associated with Dreamweaver to view 
your video displayed within the page on your site from 
YouTube. 
	
You can always return to the YouTube page to edit your description or keywords and to find the code you need 
in order to embed the video in your own site: Click the My Account button and then My Videos, and then select 
the video you want from your list of uploaded files.

Chapter 14
Making Money with Your Site
Q
uestion: “How do you make $1 million on the Internet?” 
Answer: “Invest $10 million.”
It’s an old joke, but there’s still an element of truth in it today. Although 
you can find many stories about Internet millionaires who became 
rich with seemingly little effort or investment, the truth is that most 
good Internet businesses aren’t much different from brick-and-mortar 
ones. You need a product or service that people are interested in, you 
have to deliver it in a way that’s useful and accessible, and you must 
be able to promote your business so that customers can find you.
Despite the risks involved, many people are making money from 
their Web sites, by using one of these two primary models:
	
✓	Making money from advertising: You can sell and host ads yourself, or you can 
sign up for one of the online advertising networks, such as the exceptionally pop­
ular Google AdSense. In this chapter, you find step-by-step tasks for creating and 
integrating advertising using Google AdSense or the affiliate advertising services 
Commission Junction or LinkShare, which make it easy to add advertisers to your 
site that pay a commission on any sales generated from your visitors.
	
✓	Selling products or services online: To sell products or services, you need to 
set up a system for accepting payment. Your options range from the simple 
(publishing a phone or fax number on your site that customers can call or 
send orders to) to the complex (a fancy, integrated shopping cart that enables 
visitors to select items as they navigate your site and automatically tabulates 
their purchase totals). Somewhere between these two extremes, you can sell 
products on sites like eBay or Amazon with little investment (or training) 
or set up a simple shopping cart or order button with Google Checkout or 
PayPal’s one-click service, which you find out about later in this chapter.
PayPal and Google offer the simplest solutions for selling single products — like 
memberships, tickets, or e-books — via a Web site. If you want a more compli­
cated shopping system, read my recommendations in the sidebar “Adding a shop­
ping cart to your site,” at the end of this chapter. I don’t cover these services in 
detail because another excellent book in this series, Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For 
Dummies, by Joel Elad (Wiley), explains this type of sales site in depth.
	
Because this chapter features live Web sites, some screen shots may have changed 
since this chapter was written. As a result, you may have to make adjustments to 
some of the instructions, although the basic concepts and tasks should be similar.
In This Chapter
✓	Signing up for Google 
AdSense
✓	Inserting code into a Web 
page in Dreamweaver
✓	Adding advertising from 
AdSense to your site

You can find Google ads on so many different Web sites that the ads 
seem to appear automatically. And in a way, they do. As you see in this 
task, you must sign up for an account, select the type of ads you want, 
and generate a snippet of code to insert into your own site before you 
can include Google ads on your pages. After you set it up, though, the 
rest is automatic.
Google has developed an extraordinarily complex system that makes it 
exceptionally simple to host its ads — and not just any ads, but ads that 
Google can specifically deliver to your pages based on a number of cri­
teria. The little snippet of code that you place in your pages enables 
Google to handle several tasks at once, including the ones in this list:
	✓	Target ads: The automated Google system reviews the 
text on your Web pages and matches any relevant key­
words it finds to related ad campaigns.
	✓	Deliver ads: After the snippet of code is on your pages, 
Google can deliver ads automatically based on keyword 
targeting and other criteria.
	✓	Track traffic: Google measures the traffic to each page 
that displays Google ads and tracks the number of people 
who view the page as well as the number of people who 
click to view the ad.
	✓	Measure effectiveness: Using a complex system of data col­
lection and analysis, Google can deliver detailed reports to 
advertisers about the success of their campaigns.
	✓	Calculate payments: The system keeps a running total 
of the income you’ve earned from your Google ads and 
deposits the money into your bank account automatically.
Google makes buying ads as easy as placing other people’s ads on your 
pages. And the two programs have similar names, which makes it easy 
to get confused. Remember this: Google AdSense pays you a few cents 
(or a fraction of a cent) every time someone clicks on an ad. Google 
AdWords makes it easy for you to buy ‘words’ so that your ads appear 
on Google and related Web sites.
To sign up for Google AdSense, follow these steps:
Toolbox:
✓	 An Internet connection
✓	 A Web browser, such as 
Internet Explorer or 
Firefox
✓	 A Web site where you 
want to add Google 
advertising
✓	 A Web page editing pro­

 Chapter 14: Making Money with Your Site
	1.	 Open a Web browser with a con­
nection to the Internet, and 
enter the address www.google.
com. On the main Google page, 
click the Advertising Programs 
link.
	2.	 The Advertising Programs 
page is split in two sections: 
On the left side is information 
about buying ads, and on the 
right is information about how 
publishers can make money 
by placing ads on a site (pub­
lishers, in this sense, are site 
owners who place ads on a 
site). In this task, I focus on 
the publisher side of the busi­
ness, so click the Sign Up Now 
button, on the right side.

278
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	5.	 On the verification page that’s dis­
played, read the form carefully to 
ensure that your information is 
entered correctly. If you already have 
an account with Google (for Gmail or 
any other Google service), you can 
either use that account with AdSense 
or create a new login. Either way, com­
plete the form and click the Continue 
button.
	4.	 Pay special attention to the Google Policy 
section, at the bottom of the registration 
form. You must select all these check boxes 
to indicate that you agree with the policies 
and will follow the rules. Google has had 
problems with site hosts clicking the ads on 
their own sites in an effort to generate 
income, a practice Google now works hard to 
prevent because it devalues the advertising. 
When you’re ready, click the Submit 
Information button.
	3.	 Fill in the registration form with 
your Web site address, your name, 
and other details. Note: Be careful 
to fill out this form accurately 
because the address you enter is 
the one Google sends checks to if 
your ads are successful.

279
 Chapter 14: Making Money with Your Site
	8.	 Click the AdSense Setup tab at 
the top of the page and then 
select the type of ad you want 
to create. If you want to place 
advertisements on your Web 
site, the AdSense for Content 
section is the best place to 
start. Simply click the AdSense 
for Content link to continue.
	7.	 After you receive e-mail confir­
mation from Google, you have 
everything you need to log in 
and create the code for adver­
tising on your site. Follow the 
link in the e-mail message or 
enter www.google.com/
adsense to go directly to the 
login page.
	6.	 If you filled out the form correctly, Google dis­
plays a confirmation page, even though you 
can’t get started right away. Google reserves 
the right to accept or reject anyone who 
applies for the AdSense program and, as the 
confirmation page warns, it can take a day or 
two for Google to review your site and notify 
you of your acceptance. In the meantime, you 
can find lots of helpful tips and tutorials for 
finding out more about how to make the most 
of Google AdSense.

280
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	10.	Choose the size and colors of the 
ads to display on your pages. Using 
the Format drop-down list, choose 
a size and shape that works best 
with the design of your Web pages. 
Note: You can repeat this process 
again to create ads of different 
sizes for different pages in your 
site. For now, choose the one you 
want to start with, such as the ver­
tical 120 x 600 skyscraper that I 
selected in this example.
	11.	Choose a color scheme from the drop-down 
list next to the palettes, or create your own 
color scheme by selecting the color check 
boxes next to each of the ad elements, 
such as Border, Title, and Background. You 
can also specify the style — rounded or 
square — of the corners of your ads. Finally, 
choose the content you want to display if no 
Google ads match the content of your Web 
page. For example, you can choose to dis­
play public service ads for free if no paying 
advertisers are available or simply fill the 
space with a solid color. Click the Continue 
button when you’re done.
	9.	 Choose the kinds of ads to display on your 
pages. For example, select Ad Unit and then 
choose from the options: text ads, image ads, 
or a combination of the two, which results in 
the largest number of advertising options for 
your site. Alternatively, you can select a link 
unit, which displays links to more general 
topics (matched to the keywords on your 
site) and displays for visitors a page of ads 
related to that topic. After you make your 
selection, click the Continue button at the 
bottom of the screen.

281
 Chapter 14: Making Money with Your Site
	12.	On this screen, you have the option to 
create channels, which can help you 
track the effectiveness of advertising on 
different parts of your site or across dif­
ferent Web sites, if you manage more 
than one site. You can create a channel 
for a specific domain name or create a 
custom channel to track the effective­
ness of an ad size or style that you use 
across your sites. Channels are a unique 
concept at Google, but they essentially 
serve as categories for certain kinds of 
advertising you want to track.
	13.	Finally, you see the Get Ad Code 
page, where Google has generated 
a snippet of code based on your 
selections on the previous screens. 
If you change your mind, you can 
always go back and make adjust­
ments by clicking the Back button 
at the bottom of the page. If you’re 
ready, simply click and drag to 
select all code in the AdSense 
code window, and then choose 
Edit➪Copy to select the code so 
that you can add it to your Web 
pages. You find instructions for 
inserting code into a Web page in 
Chapter 6.

282 Part III: Going Web 2.0 
Affiliate programs are a special type of advertising program designed to 
pay you a commission on any product or service that’s sold if someone 
clicks on an ad on your Web site. The tasks of signing up for affiliate 
programs and adding their respective code to your Web site work simi­
larly to Google AdSense, but the way you earn money with them is quite 
different.
With AdSense, you earn a small commission every time someone clicks 
an ad on your Web site. If you use affiliate ads, however, you’re paid 
only if someone clicks the ad and then buys something from the 
advertiser — but you’re usually paid much more if your ad leads to a 
sale. For example, a Google ad might earn you a fraction of a cent when 
someone clicks on it. But an affiliate link to Total Training (which pro­
duces video training programs) can earn you as much as 20 percent of 
the sale price on purchased videos, and that amount can be $20 or 
more per video.
Perhaps the most famous affiliate program is the one created by 
Amazon. Like most programs of this type, including Google AdSense 
(covered in the previous task), you must first fill out a registration form 
and wait to be approved, and then generate on the Amazon site a snip­
pet of code that you can add to your own pages. Many companies run 
affiliate programs themselves, like Amazon does, but other sites serve 
as virtual matchmakers, making it easy to sign up with several affiliate 
programs at once. The two largest affiliate networks sites are LinkShare 
and Commission Junction, which take on the task of managing the rela­
tionship between advertisers and publishers.
For advertisers, the advantage of a site like LinkShare is that it handles 
all the technical details of signing up publishers, delivering ads, and 
tracking results. The advantage for publishers who want to add affiliate 
ads to their Web pages is that you can sign up once with a site like 
Commission Junction and then manage your relationship with many 
advertisers from one place.
The following steps walk you through the process of signing up for the 
Commission Junction affiliate program. (The LinkShare program is quite 
similar, and many Web publishers sign up for both programs to access 
their combined stable of advertisers.)

	5.	 The CJ Account Manager features a 
series of tabs across the top of the 
page, where you can make changes 
to your account information, run 
reports to track the success of 
ad campaigns, and use the 
Commission Junction integrated 
e-mail system. Click the Get Links 
tab to start creating the code to 
add to your Web pages.
	4.	 When you click the Submit 
Information button, Commission

page and automatically sends you 
an e-mail with instructions for com-
pleting the registration process, 
filling out a W-9 tax-information 
form, and logging in to the site 
with your new username and pass­
word. Enter www.cj.com into your 
Web browser, and use the login 
and password information from 
the e-mail to sign in to the site.
	3.	 Review the service agreement. You 
must scroll to the bottom of the 
agreement and click the Accept 
button in order to accept it. Fill in 
all required fields, indicated with 
an asterisk (*). Commission 
Junction asks for a great deal of 
information on this page, including 
your Social Security number or 
corporate EIN, and you must 
answer all required questions if 
you want to sign up for this affili­
ate program. Remember to click 
the Accept Terms button at the 
bottom of the page when you’re 
done.

285
 Chapter 14: Making Money with Your Site
	6.	 On the Get Links page, you find a 
seemingly overwhelming number 
of options, but your first step is 
essentially to choose the advertis­
ers you want to work with. A good 
way to start is to browse the cate­
gories of advertisers to get a sense 
of the available options. Look for 
advertisers that sell products or 
services that are most likely to 
appeal to the people who visit 
your Web site.
	7.	 To narrow the list of advertisers, 
you can search for company names, 
products, or other keywords. Click 
the Additional Search Options link 
(shown in the figure for the preced­
ing step) at the top of the Get Links 
page to reveal more search criteria. 
You can then search by language, 
product, and other criteria. Limiting 
the list to just the advertisers in 
your primary language and in the 
geographic area you serve is a good 
start. In this example, I selected 
companies in the Domain 
Registrations category.
	8.	 As you drill down through the list of poten­
tial advertisers and start to make your selec­
tions, consider the commissions they offer 
and their overall performance in the net­
work, all of which are listed for each 
advertiser.
	
If you’re looking for a specific company, you can enter the name into the Search field at the top of the Get Links 
page at any time. If the company you’re looking for isn’t available, Commission Junction provides you with a list 
of similar companies.

286
Part III: Going Web 2.0 
	9.	 Click the name of any advertiser to display 
a Details page with a description of the 
company, program highlights, and links to 
advertising options. Click any of the 
options in the Get Links box, in the upper-
right corner, to generate the code you need 
in order to add the advertiser to your Web 
site. In this example, I chose the Banner ad 
option for 1and1.com.
	10.	Most advertisers offer a collection of ad sizes 
and designs, and you can choose which ones 
you want to place on your pages. When you 
find one you like, simply click it to continue.
	11.	If you’ve never worked with the advertiser, 
you need to join its program before you can 
add its ads to your site. Some advertisers 
require a manual approval process that can 
take a few days; others accept you into the 
program right away.

287
 Chapter 14: Making Money with Your Site
	12.	After you’re accepted into the program, the 
bottom of the Details page changes to offer 
options about how you can obtain the code 
you need to add to your own site. Choose 
HTML if you want to add the advertiser by 
simply copying and pasting HTML code into 
your Web page.
	13.	When you’re ready, simply click the 
Highlight Code button to select all 
code in the code window and then 
choose Edit➪Copy to copy the code 
so that you can add it to your Web 
pages. Then open the Web page you 
want to add this code to in a pro­
gram such as Adobe Dreamweaver. 
You can add the same code to as 
many individual pages in your site 
as you want, and you can add 
the code to a template page in 
Dreamweaver to update numerous 
pages simultaneously. (For instruc­
tions, see the task “Inserting Code 
into a Web Page in Dreamweaver,” 
in Chapter 6.)
Finding affiliate programs
This list describes a few of the more popu­
lar affiliate programs you can add to your 
Web site:
	✓	 Commission Junction: Featured in the 
task in this chapter, Commission 
Junction (www.commissionjunction.
com) is one of the most popular affiliate 
networks on the Web.
	✓	 LinkShare: Similar to Commission 
Junction, LinkShare (www.linkshare.
com) is a network of affiliate advertisers 
and makes it easy to work with many 
affiliates at once.
	✓	 Chitika: Specializing in blogs, this site, at 
www.chitika.com, offers publishers a 
service that’s part Google AdSense and 
part affiliate program, by offering ads 
that pay for clicks and sales.
	✓	 Amazon: One of the oldest and best 
known affiliate programs on the Internet, 
Amazon (www.amazon.com) makes it 
easy to sell books, computers, and any 
other products available on the site with 
links that direct your visitors to the exact 
product page at Amazon.com.
Check out these popular affiliate programs 
online, and don’t forget to search the Web 
for affiliate sites.

You can sell products and services online in many ways. At the simple 
end of the spectrum, you can set up an account at PayPal.com and start 
selling products or services in a matter of minutes, with minimal effort 
and no upfront investment.
Moving up the scale in complexity and price, you can create a shopping 
system at any of the dozens of e-commerce sites that offer more com­
plex shopping cart systems.
I recommend, as a general rule, that you start simple and add more 
complex and expensive e-commerce options as you start making more 
money. If you’re determined to add a full-featured shopping cart right 
away, the book Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, by Joel Elad 
(Wiley), gives you detailed instructions for using some of the most pop­
ular online shopping systems. If you want to get started with PayPal

Because PayPal is a prime target for fraudulent activity and identity theft, it provides many levels of verification 
and mechanisms to confirm your information, from your e-mail address to your bank account. Taking a little 
extra time to verify all your information can help protect you and your accounts.
	6.	 Fill in the forms carefully and completely. 
PayPal uses this information to process pay­
ments and to verify your identity when you 
use its service. When you finish with the 
online registration process and enter all your 
bank information, the Get Started page is dis­
played, where you can verify your 
information.
	5.	 You can read about your options and the 
steps involved on the Getting Started page, 
but all you need to do is click the Go button 
in the Sign Up Now area to continue.

	7.	 To confirm your e-mail address, click the Go 
button. PayPal sends an e-mail message to 
the address you entered when you com­
pleted the registration form. Open the link in 
that message in a Web browser and enter 
your password when prompted to complete 
the e-mail verification process.
	8.	 When you complete the registra­
tion process, and whenever you log 
in to PayPal, you should see the My 
Account Overview page, where you 
find links to the many features 
offered by PayPal. Next, you should 
complete the bank verification pro­
cess, which you can do by scrolling 
down the page and clicking the Go 
button, next to Confirm Your Bank 
Instantly.
	9.	 To ensure that you’re who you say you are 
and that you have access to the bank 
account you entered when you registered, 
PayPal makes two small deposits into your 
account — maybe as little as a few cents. 
The goal isn’t for you to make a lot of money 
but to ensure that you can prove that the 
account is yours by entering the exact 
amount of the deposits into the bank confir­
mation form on PayPal. Your bank will likely 
take a few days to record the deposits, so 
you’ll have to wait to find out the amounts 
and confirm your account. In the meantime, 
you can continue to set up your account and 
even begin using the PayPal services, but 
PayPal won’t deposit any money you’ve 
earned from sales until you confirm your 
account by telling PayPal the exact amount 
that was deposited.

information about the product or service 
you want to sell and the amount you want to 
sell it for. Then select the size and style of 
button you want. (This is how the button will 
appear on your Web page.) Then choose 
your shipping and sales tax options. You 
also have Button encryption options: Select 
the Yes radio button to enable encryption if 
you want to create a button that’s more 
secure. (Note: It cannot be edited again after 
you create it. Of course, you can always go 
back and create a new button if you want to 
make changes.) Select the No radio button if 
you want to be able to modify the code after 
it’s added to your page. (Note: Choose this 
advanced option only if you know how to 
edit the code yourself.)
	12.	Click the Create Button Now button at the 
bottom of the form. Then click the Select All

to open the Web page to which you want to 
add this code in a program such as Adobe 
Dreamweaver. (For instructions, see the task 
“Inserting Code into a Web Page in 
Dreamweaver,” in Chapter 6.)
	
Online services, such as PayPal and Google, that handle money are especially vulnerable to unscrupulous spam­
mers and fraud. If you receive e-mails from these services, check them carefully and make sure the domain of 
the sender and any links you click really are from PayPal or Google.

Adding a shopping cart to your site
Although PayPal offers a quick and easy 
way to start selling products and services 
on the Web, you might find many other 
options superior, especially if you want to 
sell many products or services on your Web 
site. Here are a few of the most popular 
e-commerce options on the Web:
	✓	 Yahoo! Merchant Solutions (store.
yahoo.com) offers a full line of 
e-commerce services, including a multi­
faceted shopping cart. One of the most 
popular services on the Internet, Yahoo! is 
competitively priced, highly customiz­
able, and takes care of every aspect of the 
shopping cart and transaction services.
	✓	 Google Checkout for Merchants 
(https://checkout.google.com/
sell) requires no sign up fee, is quick 
and easy to set up, and provides buy 
buttons as well as a simple shopping 
cart, similar to the one provided by 
PayPal, which is covered in the final task 
in this chapter.
	✓	 ProStores (www.prostores.com) is an 
eBay company that offers an all-in-one 
shopping system and an enterprise-
level ecommerce solution that includes 
supply chain and vendor management 
tools.
	✓	 1&1 Internet (www.1and1.com) claims 
to be the largest domain registrar in the 
world. This site also provides Web host­
ing, e-commerce, and a shopping cart 
system.
	✓	 PayLoadz (www.payloadz.com), is spe­
cially designed to sell e-books, software, 
and other digital products, as well as 
fee-based services, such as subscrip­
tions and memberships.
For more detailed instructions on working 
with these shopping carts, read the book 
Web Stores Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, 
by Joel Elad (Wiley).

Ten Cool Services for Your Site
In This Chapter
▶	 Developing e-mail newsletters
▶	 Finding inexpensive professional images
▶	 Using pop-up previews
▶	 Identifying fonts in graphics
▶	 Creating surveys for your visitors
▶	 Adding a favicon to the address bar
▶	 Hiding your e-mail address from spammers
▶	 Tracking Web visitors

T
he best Web sites include a broad range of features, from attractive graph­
ics to interactive surveys to detailed reports about site visitors. However, 
many of the most advanced features are highly complex to create and maintain. 
Fortunately, a growing list of Web services allows you to easily add specialized 
options to your Web site, without having to spend a lot of time or money. In this 
chapter, I introduce you to some of my favorite online resources — sites that can 
help you take your site beyond the basics without breaking the bank.
	
Most Web-based services like these make it easy to set up an account and then gener­
ate a snippet of HTML code that you can add to your own Web site. You find instruc­
tions for adding code snippets to your pages using Dreamweaver in Chapter 13.
Measuring Traffic from Web Visitors
Don’t settle for the lame statistics you get from most Web servers. You need to 
know who is visiting your site. Add your own stat counter and you’ll get far more 
details about where visitors come from and even what they search for in Google to 
find you. Although most service providers include basic Web traffic reports as part 
of their hosting services, you’re likely to get far better results from a service like 
Google Analytics or StatCounter.com.
Google Analytics is one of the best traffic counters on the Web, and one of the most 
popular — and it’s free! You just add a little snippet of code to your Web pages, and 
Google tracks your visitors, creating a comprehensive report full of juicy details.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You’ll not only get the numbers of visitors and where they came from, you can even 
see what people search for on Google before they visit your site.
To sign up, just visit www.google.com/analytics and follow the instructions to 
create an account for your site and generate the code you’ll need to add to your 
pages. Then it’s as easy as copy and paste to get your site set up. If you use a tem­
plate to create your pages, you can simply paste the Google Analytics code snipped 
into the bottom of your template and it will automatically be added to all your 
pages.
Creating and Managing E-mail Newsletters
One of the best ways to keep people coming back to your Web site is to remind 
them of what you have to offer, and one of the best ways to do that is to create an 
e-mail newsletter.
Managing e-mail newsletters is a complex process. Creating a page design that 
works well in lots of different e-mail programs is hard enough, but did you know 
about all the legal requirements regarding what you can and can’t do when you 
send an e-mail letter to a mailing list?
Among other things, you’re legally required to make it easy for people to stop get­
ting your e-mail if they don’t want to subscribe. If you’ve ever used the unsubscribe 
link at the bottom of an e-mail message you received, you probably understand why 
it’s important to make it easy for people to get off your mailing list, as well as sign 
up in the first place. See the nearby sidebar for more about legal requirements.
If you have more than a few people on your mailing list or you want to send mes­
sages on a regular basis, you’ll be best served by signing up with an e-mail newslet­
ter service. You can read all about such services in E-Mail Marketing For Dummies 
by John Arnold (published by Wiley).
Here are a few of the most popular ones:
	
✓	Constant Contact: Considered the most popular online newsletter service, 
Constant Contact has been in business since 1996. As of this writing, 
prices start at $15 per month for up to 500 e-mails per month. (www.
constantcontact.com)
	
✓	iContact: This service is quickly growing in popularity, in large part because 
it’s priced more competitively than Constant Contact and offers more newslet­
ter designs to choose from. As of this writing, prices start at $9.95 per month. 
(www.icontact.com)
	
✓	Benchmark Email: In this increasingly competitive category, Benchmark 
offers 600 e-mails per month for $9.95 or a popular $19.95-per-month 
plan that enables you to send up to 2,500 messages per month. (www.
benchmarkemail.com)

Downloading Professional Images 
Inexpensively
Professional photographs and graphics can transform a simple page design into a 
professional showcase. High-quality images can be pricey, though. For professional, 
royalty-free images without the high price tag, visit iStockphoto (www.istock
photo.com) where you can buy — and sell — high-quality photos and other 
images for $1 to $5 (depending on the resolution).
This searchable site makes it easy to find all kinds of photographs, illustrations, 
and even animated graphics and videos. Search for German Shepherd, for example, 
and you’ll find nearly 1,000 photos of those lovely beasts; search for dogs, and 
you’ll find more than 16,000. You can even search for general terms, such as smile 
or raised hands, to find images to fit almost any design idea or Web site.
When you find a photo that you like at iStockphoto, you can download a comp ver­
sion for free. Free images have the iStockphoto logo printed across the middle but 
are handy to use for mockups. You can also save images to a collection (a lightbox) 
stored on the iStockphoto Web site so you can easily go back and review your 
favorites later.
U.S. law and e-mail newsletters or other bulk messages
If you send bulk e-mail messages of any 
kind, here are the basics you need to know 
about U.S. law, as well as generally-recom­
mended netiquette. For more details about 
how the laws vary from state to state, visit 
www.mass-emailer.com/bulk_email_info.
html. If you live outside the United States, 
your government Web site likely provides 
the information you need to stay in good 
legal standing.
	✓	 No false or misleading information in 
the header area of an e-mail: Spammers 
do it all the time (and many get caught, 
or at least blocked by spam filters for the 
practice). If you’re sending a legitimate 
message, make sure the address you 
use in the From field of the message is 
your legitimate e-mail address, and also 
that any addresses you display in the To 
field are real. One of the biggest advan­
tages of using an e-mail service (such as 
iContact) is that it provides a contact 
manager with which you can manage all 
your e-mail addresses.
	✓	 Deceptive subject lines: You can’t claim 
that the e-mail is about dogs and cats in 
the subject line and then try to sell the 
recipient guinea pigs via the message.
	✓	 An opt-out method: There must be an 
easy way for recipients to let you know 
they don’t want to receive any more mes­
sages from you — and you must remove 
them from your list if they do. This is one 
of the best reasons to use a service, such 
as Benchmark Email or iContact because 
all these services enable subscribers to 
opt-out automatically.
	✓	 Compliance with restrictions on distrib­
uting addresses you collect: You cannot 
sell or transfer e-mail addresses of 
people who have chosen not to receive 
your e-mail, and you cannot help any 
other entity send them messages (even 
if you don’t charge for the service).
	✓	 Clear intent: All commercial e-mail must 
be identified as an advertisement and 
must include the sender’s postal 
address.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
When you’re ready to purchase images, you can use any major credit card to buy 
credits on the site. The more credits you buy in advance, the better the price. The 
cost of each image is based on the resolution: The higher the resolution, the more 
the image costs, but most images are available in multiple resolutions. Prices can 
vary by image, but most low-resolution images (less than 400 pixels wide at 72 dpi), 
which work fine for most Web sites, cost as little as $1. Make sure the read the 
license agreement for details.
If you’re looking for free images, or you like the idea of using images that are pro­
vided for free by photographer directly, consider www.sxc.hu, where you find 
more than 300,000 images from more than 30,000 photographers. Again, make sure 
to read the contract details carefully because some images on this site require that 
you work out the right to use the images with the photographers directly.
In Chapter 5, I give you instructions for editing, resizing, and saving images. See 
Chapter 6 for instructions for inserting images into your Web pages.
Highlighting Links with Pop-Up Previews
The innovative online service Snap-shots (www.snap.com) creates a small pop-up 
preview of any page you link to on your site. You simply sign up for the free service 
at Snap.com and use its online tool to generate special code that you can copy and 
paste into the code in your Web pages.
With the unique Snap.com pop-ups, anytime a visitor rolls the cursor over a link, a 
small pop-up window appears with a preview that displays the page or site that you 
linked to from your site. It’s a useful way to give visitors a little more information as 
they peruse your pages and to highlight the links on your site.
WhatTheFont? (An Online Matchmaker)
If you’ve ever tried to identify an unusual font, you know how challenging it can 
be — and you’ll likely appreciate the character recognition software offered from 
WhatTheFont (www.whatthefont.com). Using this free online service, you can 
upload any graphic or enter the URL to any image on the Web, and the program 
analyzes the image and tries to identify the font.
The system isn’t perfect, but even if WhatTheFont can’t identify the exact font, it 
gives you the closest matches it can find, which at least gets you pointed in the 
right direction. You can also opt for the “human” service, to have your graphic fur­
ther reviewed by expert font matchers.
And, if you want to buy the font after you use the service to identify it, the site’s 
creators are happy to sell you fonts that you download to your own computer. For 
more on the best options for using fonts on the Web, see Chapter 6.
Another great place to test fonts . . . www.dafont.com.

 Chapter 15: Ten Cool Services for Your Site
Surveying Your Visitors
If you want to know what visitors to your site really think, just ask them.
An online survey is a helpful way to gauge the experience of your audience and to 
invite reviews. You can also use online surveys as planning tools to poll your audi­
ence about how and where they might want an event, for example, or what new fea­
tures they’re most interested in.
You can create a free, online survey from SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.
com) and link to it from your Web site. SurveyMonkey makes it easy to create the 
survey by simply filling out a form in a Web browser, and then it automatically tal­
lies the results and presents them in a series of reports and pie charts. The data 
you can gather and present is an excellent way to impress your board of directors 
at your company’s next annual meeting.
Dressing Up the Address Bar with a Favicon
Have you ever wondered how some sites add those little custom graphics to the 
address bar, at the top of the browser? For example, Google adds the letter G, and 
Adobe adds its logo. You too can add any image to your site — you just have to get 
it in the right format.
Fortunately, turning a graphic into a favicon (or shortcut icon) is easy and free with 
FavIcon from Pics (www.htmlkit.com/services/favicon). Just upload any 
graphic of your own, and this online tool automatically converts it into a favicon 
that you can use on your site. After your image is saved in the ICO format, you 
simply upload it to the main root folder of your Web site, and your image is auto­
matically displayed on the address bar in a browser.
Favicons also appear in the list of bookmarks, or favorites (which is where the 
name comes from) when a visitor saves your Web site in a browser. Thus, including 
a favicon can make your site stand out from a list of saved Web addresses and can 
help build and strengthen your brand.
Protecting Your E-Mail Address 
from Spammers
Spammers gather millions of e-mail addresses from Web sites every day by collecting 
e-mail addresses from links on Web pages. Web designers commonly include e-mail 
links so that visitors can easily contact them. Unfortunately, those simple e-mail links 
make it even easier for spammers to gather e-mail addresses automatically.
To help counter this problem, the programmers at AddressMunger (www.
addressmunger.com) have come up with a special way of “hiding” e-mail 
addresses from the automated bots that spammers use. When you add this special 

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
code to your Web pages and use AddressMunger to create the e-mail links on your 
Web pages, your visitors can still e-mail you easily, but spammers can’t read your 
e-mail address. It’s an easy way to cut down on all that spam in your inbox.
To use this service, you need two snippets of code:
	
✓	One that you insert into the top of a Web page
	
✓	Another that you add wherever you want your e-mail address to appear
You can find instructions for adding code to your pages in Chapter 13.
Setting Up Free Conference Calls
Want to set up a conference call for free? Really, for free. Well, you do have to pay 
any long-distance charges you incur if your call to the conference center requires 
dialoging a long-distance number, but if you have an unlimited calling plan with 
your phone company, you’re already covered on that front. You can pay extra for 
an 800 number, but if you’re willing to let the service pick the number, all you pay 
are any necessary toll call charges.
To use the service, simply visit FreeConference at www.freeconference.com, 
sign up for the free account, and immediately start scheduling conference calls. 
You can invite as many people as you like into the call. FreeConference even 
includes a handy system for managing contact information and sending out invites 
on your behalf.
I use the service on a regular basis to schedule conference calls with clients and 
students. You can even add desktop sharing for $9 per month, making it possible to 
simultaneously share information on your computer or use the service. That makes it 
ideal for Webinars, review sessions, or other kinds of collaborative meetings online.
The company makes money by charging for specialized services, such as the use of 
an 800 number, or if you want FreeConference to record or transcribe your calls.
	
And like most things that are free, FreeConference can’t guarantee availability, so 
scheduling in advance is always wise although I’ve rarely had any trouble setting up 
a call, even at the last minute.
Sharing PowerPoint Presentations
Online training, teleconferences, and virtual seminars are increasingly popular, 
thanks to services like SlideShare (www.slideshare.net). To use this innovative 
service, just upload your presentation to the site and point visitors to your special 
address, where they can view your slides and use the simple controls at SlideShare 
to move forward and back through your presentation.
	
Combine SlideShare with a service like FreeConference, and you’re ready to host a 
professional teleconference or online seminar — without spending a cent.

W
hat if you build a Web site, and nobody comes? Unfortunately, that’s 
an all-too-common problem on the Internet. And, that’s why I can’t end 
this book without at least pointing you to a few places where you can promote 
your Web site. Driving significant traffic to the pages of a site requires a significant 
amount of time or money or an incredibly compelling message. If you can manage 
all three, you should do very well indeed. In this chapter, you find tips and online 
resources to help bring people to your Web site.
Scoring High in Search Engines
The buzzword here is search engine optimization, or SEO, a highly complicated sci­
ence that involves getting search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo! to list your 
Web site higher on the page than your competitors.
	
Thousands of companies and services promise to “get you in the top 10 matches” on 
search engines for as little as $19.99. Be wary of these services. The truly good ones 
charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars per month (with good reason), and 
the bad ones can get you delisted from search engines for breaking the rules with 
old tricks like inserting the word sex into your code when you’re site is really about 
car maintenance. Most SEO experts agree that the best way to score high in search 
engines is to provide useful information on your site and to use appropriate key­
words effectively.

304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Scoring high in Web searches is complicated because millions of sites vie for the 
top spots and search engines use complex formulas to determine which Web site 
should match any given key word search. Search engines also guard their formulas 
for how they prioritize Web sites more carefully than Coca-Cola guards its recipe. 
And if that doesn’t make it complicated enough, most search engines change their 
formulas regularly. (How regularly is also secret.)
The reason for all this secrecy is that the people who run sites like Google and 
Bing want to deliver the best results when someone conducts a search — not just 
a list of the sites that smart Web marketers figured out how to trick their way into 
top position. Because there’s much money to be made at the top, Web marketers 
spend countless hours testing how search engines work to come up with their best 
guesses about the criteria that search engines are using and how best to move their 
sites up the list.
The result is sort of a cat-and-mouse game, with search engines changing the rules to 
thwart the most calculated efforts of specialist’s in SEO, and people who specialize in 
SEO charging big bucks to figure out the secret formula that can put you on top.
For the most part, search engines score sites based on the words and images on 
Web pages and on how well their content matches the keywords that are searched. 
For example, if you own a B&B in Point Reyes Station, California, you should include 
at least the name Point Reyes Station on your Web site because the term B&B has 
many competitors and people searching for lodging in the area are likely to include 
the town’s name in their search.
	
A great way to determine how best to make your own site search engine friendly is 
to search for keywords that you want to lead people to your site and then study the 
Web sites that match those words already. Often, the best way to move your Web 
site up the ranks in search results is to emulate the strategies of other sites that are 
already doing well.
Achieving the best placement, especially for popular keywords, is a full-time job, 
but here are a few tips that most SEO specialists agree are likely to help you score 
better in search engine searches.
	
✓	Invite other sites to link to you. It’s widely believed that Google rewards 
people who attract the most links to their sites, especially if those sites 
already have good rankings themselves. It makes sense: If lots of other Web 
sites consider your site good enough to send their visitors to you, you prob­
ably have something of value to offer. 
	
✓	Fill your site with fresh, original content related to your business or indus­
try. Include tips, articles, tutorials, and other content that’s valuable to your 
visitors, and don’t stop there. Keeping your content updated by adding fresh 
information on a regular basis is another great way to keep search engines — 
and visitors — interested.
	
✓	Develop a list of keywords and a good description for your site. The trick to 
writing a good Web site description is making it concise (every word counts), 
packing it with your most important keywords, and phrasing it so that it reads 
like a sentence (not just a list of words). Include this description toward the 
top of your home page in the meta description tag, which is a special tag that 
can be used to add information just for search engines. (You find instructions 
for adding Meta descriptions and keyword content in Chapter 6.)

305
 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
	
✓	Include your most important keywords in the title of your Web page and the 
name of the file. The title doesn’t appear in the body of a Web page; the title 
appears at the top of the browser window. You can add or edit the title of a 
page in Dreamweaver by changing the text in the Title field at the very top of 
the workspace. Similarly, including keywords in the filename of each page in 
your Web site can also boost rankings. 
	
✓	Include keywords in the headlines on your Web page. Most search engines 
place higher priority on keywords that appear in the headlines on a page, but 
only if you use XHTML heading tags to style those headlines. Heading tags, 
which include h1 (the biggest) through h6 (the smallest), identify text as head­
lines in a way that search engines easily recognize. 
	
✓	Don’t expect instant (or permanent) results. Even if you do everything right 
in the search engine search game, you might still have to wait for the results 
of your efforts to be recognized. Some search engines can take weeks or 
months to reflect changes to Web pages on the Internet. Search engines, such 
as Google, generally update the most popular sites very quickly while lagging 
weeks or months behind in updating less-visited sites.
	
A great place to learn more about how search engines work and how to achieve the 
best ranking is www.searchenginewatch.com.
Buying Traffic (Yes, You Really Can!)
In addition to the “natural” results that search engines deliver when someone 
does a keyword search, buying keywords on search engines helps to ensure that 
your site is listed when someone searches for words that are relevant to your site, 
although the process is far more complex than most people realize. Search engine 
ads generally appear at the top and right side of most search-result pages. 
Not all keywords sell for the same price. Using a complex bidding process, most 
search engines charge significantly more for the most popular keywords. Adding to 
the complexity, the results of those keywords for your site can vary dramatically 
based on a dizzying array of factors. For example, the expensive keyword Hawaii 
may bring the most amount of traffic to your site, but the lower-priced keyword 
luau may result in more reservations to your hotel. Because it’s possible to mea­
sure not only the traffic from a keyword search but also the actions of the person 
who clicks on that keyword, you can measure and compare the effectiveness of 
nearly every aspect of search engine advertising.
Again, this process can be highly complex. Just developing a list of keywords worth 
purchasing seems easier than it really is at first. Sure, if you have a B&B in Point 
Reyes, you can likely make a list of a few dozen obvious words quickly. But the real 
art of developing a list of keywords for search engine advertising requires more 
than just brainstorming a few words related to your business. The best SEO compa­
nies come up with hundreds or thousands of keywords and phrases and then track 
the results to find the best return on dollars spent for paying customers. Thus, run­
ning a campaign with 10,000 words might not cost much more than running a cam­
paign with 100 words, and might prove much more effective over time.

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Add to that strategy the importance of landing pages and sales messages. The 
most sophisticated ad campaigns involve creating special Web pages to go with 
each keyword ad. For example, you can create a special page (often called a land­
ing page) on your Hawaiian hotel site for people who click the search term scuba 
diving that is different from the page for those who click the search term health 
spa. You can learn more about how to make the most of your keyword ads by care­
fully reading the instructions and tips on any site where you plan to advertise.
	
Google AdSense offers the largest online advertising program for keywords. Just 
click the Advertise button at www.google.com to find detailed instructions and a 
number of tips and tools to help you develop the best campaign and measure the 
results.
In addition to buying ads on Google, you can include Google Ads on your own Web 
site to earn advertising income. In Chapter 14, you find tips on how to earn income 
from your site with Google Ads.
Using Social Networking Sites 
for Promotion
Social networking, the art of meeting and building contacts on the Web, is an 
increasingly popular way to increase your personal and professional contacts, 
make new friends, develop professional relationships, and even find a new job. You 
can also use social networking sites to promote your personal or business Web 
site. Netiquette (Internet etiquette) calls for a subtle approach to promoting your 
site in these kinds of environments, but simply including your Web address in your 
online profile can help drive new people to your site. 
Here are some of the most popular social networking sites and what you can expect 
to find there:
	
✓	Facebook: (www.facebook.com) Facebook wins top place as the fastest 
growing social networking site on the Web, and its broad appeal makes it an 
excellent place to promote your Web site. Facebook was originally considered 
a vanity site and a place for college students, but its professional power is 
growing with its ever-expanding audience.
	
✓	LinkedIn: (www.linkedin.com) This is the site for professional connections 
and online business networking. If you’re online to develop business contacts 
with other professionals, especially if you’re job hunting or trying to attract 
new business clients, this is a powerful place to promote yourself and your 
Web site. Unlike Facebook and MySpace, LinkedIn is all business.
	
✓	MySpace: (www.myspace.com) One of the all-time most popular social net­
working sites, MySpace makes it easy to create a profile site, add music, write 
a blog, and post as many photos as you want to share with the world. Although 
the site has dominated the social networking landscape on the Internet, at 
the time of this writing, it was rapidly falling behind its biggest competitor, 
Facebook. Still, its huge online audience is a popular place for musicians, per­
formers, and many others to promote themselves and their Web sites.

✓	Ecademy: (www.ecademy.com) Similar to LinkedIn, Ecademy is a site where 
professionals network, seek new clients, hunt for jobs, and recruit employees. 
What makes Ecademy different is that it’s much more international, with an 
especially strong audience in Europe and Asia.
	
✓	Ning: (www.ning.com) You can create your own social networking site at 
Ning and invite your friends and colleagues to create profiles there in your 
own exclusive social network environment.
Getting Ranked on Social 
Bookmarking Sites
Social bookmarking sites rank the popularity of Web pages by the number of votes 
they get. The result is that these sites are excellent resources for people who want 
to keep up with what’s popular online. Most offer special software that makes it 
easy for anyone to vote on a site.
Getting your site listed on social bookmarking sites is a highly effective way to 
increase traffic. Dozens of these sites and services exist, with more sure to come, 
and they feature catchy and unusual names, like Digg (http://digg.com), 
delicious (http://delicious.com), StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com, 
and reddit (www.reddit.com).
Although you can submit your own pages on any of these sites, it’s generally 
frowned upon and if you do it too frequently, you can be banned. Besides, your one 
little vote won’t make much different anyway. A better method is to add a button to 
your site from each of these services that makes it easy for your visitors to vote for 
you. If you’re a blogger, you can add a button each time you post. You can get the 
buttons (chicklets) for free and add them to your pages by simply inserting a little 
code you generate on the social networking site. (Find instructions for adding code 
to your pages in Chapter 6.)
Enticing Visitors to Return for Updates
One of the best ways to improve traffic to your site is through repeat visitors, and 
regular updates to your site can make all the difference. If you want your visitors to 
know when to look for updates, consider making regular changes to your Web site. 
Add a post to your blog every Thursday morning, for example, or post your newest 
photos to the site on Saturday mornings. Regular updates help get people in the 
habit of visiting your site.
Gathering Ideas from Other Web Sites
One of the best ways to create good habits in Web design is to visit other people’s 
Web sites and study what works and what doesn’t on their pages. While you’re 
there, check out the title of the page, any descriptive text, or keywords that are 

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
used throughout the site. As you look at related Web sites, ask yourself what you 
like about the site and why you like it. Also, determine whether you can easily find 
the information you’re most interested in and how easily you can navigate around 
the site.
Sometimes the best way to discover the problems in your own Web site is to look for 
problems on someone else’s site and then return to yours with a fresh perspective. 
Marketing a Web Site to the Media
Attracting traditional media attention to your Web site is not unlike attracting 
it to any other business. The trick is to tell a good story and get the attention of 
someone who can write about it in a publication that’s read by your target audi­
ence. If you’re looking for press coverage, make sure to include a Press section on 
your Web site with contact information, story ideas, and any other press coverage 
you’ve received.
	
Don’t wait for journalists to come to you! You should never pester a reporter with 
a barrage of e-mail, press releases, or phone calls, but a well-timed or well-pitched 
message can get the attention of a reporter and the desired result — your Web 
address in the press. One good way to find journalists who might be interested in 
your site is to visit related sites and study their Press sections to find out who has 
been writing about them. Note not only the publication but also the writer. Then 
send a note directly to that person with a message that starts like this:
Dear fabulous journalist <insert that person’s name, of course>:
I enjoyed reading the article you wrote on the XYZ company and thought that 
you might be interested in what we’re doing.
Keep your message brief, and try to include a news hook and story idea that go 
beyond just promoting your business. For example, rather than tell a reporter that 
you have the best B&B site in northern California, pitch a story about the best hikes 
in the area. With any luck, the article on great hikes will include a quote from you 
and a mention of your B&B’s Web site (especially if the reporter can send readers 
to your online list of hiking tips).
Unleashing the Power of Viral Marketing
Viral marketing is another of the marketing industry’s new buzzwords in the digital 
age. The idea is that a message (a video, an article, or a photo, for example) is so 
exciting, fun, and compelling that people want to share it with each other, passing it 
on to their friends, who then pass it on to their friends, until it spreads like a virus. 
Such messages are often sent via e-mail, blogs, or chat, which can make the ever-
expanding impact happen at an almost instantaneous pace.
Tap in to the power of viral marketing, and you can become an overnight sensation. 
Humor seems to be the most effective strategy. Among the mainstays of the viral 
phenomena are those silly photos of cats with clever sayings. Known as the LOL 
cats, these photos have spawned several Web sites, like Icanhascheeseburger.com. 

309
 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Promote Your Site
Funny video clips, the kind you would expect to see featured on a show like America’s 
Funniest Home Videos, are also highly viral because they’re shared around the Web.
To use viral marketing to attract traffic to your Web site, include a section with 
funny photos, industry jokes, or a Top 10 list, and you might just get visitors to tell 
their friends about your site.
Blogging, Blogging, Blogging
Creating a blog and adding it to your Web site makes it easy to add fresh content 
because blogs are designed for frequent updates. When you become a blogger, you 
also join the ranks of a prolific group of writers who regularly refer their readers to 
each other’s Web sites.
	
Don’t launch a blog just to “do it.” Make sure that your blog features interesting, rele­
vant information for your audience and that you update it regularly. And, if you want 
your blog to serve as an effective marketing tool, take the time to participate in other 
people’s blogs. Adding relevant tips and thoughtful comments to other people’s 
blogs is an excellent way to get their visitors to come back to your Web site.
Instructions for creating a blog and integrating it into your Web site are in Chapter 11.
Using Twitter to Promote Your Site
One of the most popular new forms of social media can be found at www.twitter.
com. Described as micro blogging, Twitter makes it easy to register and start shar­
ing your words of wisdom, but you have to keep it brief. Twitter limits users to 140 
characters (about a sentence) of text per post. At first, many users complained that 
Twitter was a trivial place where people shared too many boring details, such as 
“I’m going to lunch at Red Lobster now.”
But as Twitter has evolved, it’s become an incredibly popular way for friends to 
stay in touch, and for businesses, actors, and others to promote themselves. Just 
visit www.twitter.com and register for a free account, and you can start posting 
short messages about what you’re doing, what you’re thinking, or questions you’re 
pondering. Anyone who uses Twitter can subscribe to the Twitter feed of anyone 
else who uses Twitter and receive all their comments, called Tweets.
Telling Everyone You Know
It might seem obvious, but many people are either too shy or too busy to reach out 
to their friends, family, and personal contacts when they launch a Web site. Don’t 
overlook your most obvious supporters. Launching a new Web site, or redesigning 
an existing site, is an excellent excuse to e-mail personal and professional contacts. 
To make the announcement even more fun, consider sending an e-card with a color­
ful character, animation, or music to dramatize your announcement.

310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Hallmark.com is one of my favorite e-card sites because it has lots of free cards 
with clever sayings, professional designs, and interactive animations. Most of 
its free e-cards even include sound. BlueMountain.com is another useful e-card 
site, but you have to pay for the pleasure of sending its professional greetings. 
When choosing an e-card to announce your Web site, look for blank cards or the 
Friendship and Any Occasion sections, where you can find messages that are easily 
personalized for nearly any kind of Web site.
	
Make sure you include your URL on all your marketing and other materials, too. 
Your Web address should be prominently displayed on your business cards, bro­
chures, stationery, and anywhere else you promote your business.
