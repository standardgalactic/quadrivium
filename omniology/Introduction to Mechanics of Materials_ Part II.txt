Preface
Preface
This book presents a basic introductory course to the mechanics of materials for students of mechanical 
engineering. It gives students a good background for developing their ability to analyse given problems 
using fundamental approaches. The necessary prerequisites are the knowledge of mathematical analysis, 
physics of materials and statics since the subject is the synthesis of the above mentioned courses. 
The book consists of six chapters and an appendix. Each chapter contains the fundamental theory and 
illustrative examples. At the end of each chapter the reader can find unsolved problems to practice their 
understanding of the discussed subject. The results of these problems are presented behind the unsolved 
problems.
Chapter 1 discusses the most important concepts of the mechanics of materials, the concept of stress. 
This concept is derived from the physics of materials. The nature and the properties of basic stresses, 
i.e. normal, shearing and bearing stresses; are presented too.
Chapter 2 deals with the stress and strain analyses of axially loaded members. The results are generalised 
into Hooke’s law. Saint-Venant’s principle explains the limits of applying this theory. 
In chapter 3 we present the basic theory for members subjected to torsion. Firstly we discuss the torsion 
of circular members and subsequently, the torsion of non-circular members is analysed.
In chapter 4, the largest chapter, presents the theory of beams. The theory is limited to a member with 
at least one plane of symmetry and the applied loads are acting in this plane. We analyse stresses and 
strains in these types of beams.
Chapter 5 continues the theory of beams, focusing mainly on the deflection analysis. There are two 
principal methods presented in this chapter: the integration method and Castigliano’s theorem.
Chapter 6 deals with the buckling of columns. In this chapter we introduce students to Euler’s theory in 
order to be able to solve problems of stability in columns.
In closing, we greatly appreciate the fruitful discussions between our colleagues, namely prof. Pavel 
Élesztős, Dr. Michal Čekan. And also we would like to thank our reviewers’ comments and suggestions.

4.1	
Introduction
In the previous Chapters we have discussed axial loading by vector analysis, i.e. the vectors of applied 
forces and moments coincide with the direction of the member’s axes. Now we are going to investigate 
transverse loading, i.e. the applied loads cause that some of the internal force and moment vectors to be 
perpendicular to the axis of the member, see Fig. 4.1. The presented bar in the clamp, used for gluing 
sheets of plywood together, is subjected to the bending moment M = Fd and the normal force N = F The 
cantilever beam is subjected to the bending moment M(x) = Fx and the shear or transverse force V(x) = Fx. 
In these cases, where perpendicular internal moment vectors are contained, the members are subjected 
to bending. Our discussion will be limited to the bending of straight prismatic members with at least 
one plane of symmetry at the cross-sections, see Fig. 4.2. The applied loads are exerted in the plane of 
symmetry, see Fig. 4.3. Under these limitations we will analyse stresses and strains in members subjected 
to bending and subsequently discuss the design of straight prismatic beams.

Bending of Straight Beams
As we mentioned before in a step-by-step approach, the first step is to draw the free body diagram, where 
the removed supports are replaced by corresponding reactions. The four basic supports and reactions 
are represented in Fig. 4.4.
The next step in the step-by step solution is to calculate the reactions using equilibrium equations. If 
the bending problem is in a plane, then the beam has three degrees of freedom (DOFs). To prevent 
motion of the beam, the supports must fix all three DOFs, see Fig. 4.5. Thus we obtain the equilibrium 
equations as follows

Bending Moment and Shear Force
 
Fig. 4.6
The method of section is applied for determining the distribution functions of bending moments and 
shear forces. The positive orientation of shear force is explained in Section 1.2, see Fig. 1.7. The positive 
sign in the bending moment depends on the deformation. Let us consider only a bending moment 
exerted in the arbitrary section of a beam, see Fig. 4.6. This bending moment can be replaced with the 
moment couple 
. These force systems are equivalent. The upper force 
 is the compressive 
force and the lower force  is tensile. Thus the positive bending moment causes a compression in the 
upper portion of the beam and simultaneously causes a tension in the lower portion of beam, see Fig. 
4.7 and the negative bending moment results in an opposite beam deformation. The effects of positive 
and negative bending moments on beam deformations are also presented in Fig. 4.7.

Shear and Bending Moment Diagrams
 
Fig. 4.8
For determining and drawing the shear force, or simple shear and bending moment diagram, we must 
strictly apply the step-by-step solution, for more details about this approach see Section 1.6. Let us explain 
the whole procedure on a simply supported beam, see Fig. 4.8(a). In this beam we have two portions, 
namely portion BC which we denote as the first and portion CD which we denote as the second. Drawing 
the free body diagram and solving the corresponding equilibrium equations we get the reactions, see  
Fig. 4.8(b). Then, cutting the beam at an arbitrary point QQ from the left side to the right one for portion 
BC, see Fig. 4.9(a) we draw this separated portion BQ and replace the effect of the removed part by adding 
positive internal forces in section Q1Q1, see Fig. 4.9(b) and thus get the following equilibrium equations

Bending of Straight Beams
A great disadvantage when using the above mentioned approach is the use of two functions for the shear 
forces and two functions for the bending moments. Considering the beam with ten different portions, 
then we will get ten different functions for the given variables! To overcome this inconvenience, we 
can apply singularity functions for determining the shear and bending moment diagrams. The use of 
singularity functions makes it possible to represent the shear V and the bending moment M by a single 
mathematical expression. Lets again consider the previous problem of the simply supported beam, see 
Fig. 4.8. Instead of applying two cuts in opposite directions we will now assume the same direction for 
both cuts. Thus we get the following shear and bending moment functions

Now when the beam is subjected to several loads, we can then divide them into individual basic loads 
using the principle of superposition. Thus the shear and bending moment at any point of the beam 
can be obtained by adding up the corresponding functions associated with each of the basic loads and 
reactions. The singularity functions for simple loads are represented in Fig. 4.11.

In the following problem Fig. 4.12, an illustrative application of the singularity functions can be seen. 
Our task is to find the distribution functions of shear and bending moment. At first we divide the applied 
load into basic loads according to Fig. 4.11 and then apply the principle of superposition to get

The last two terms in the above equations represent the distributed load that does not finish at the end 
of beam as the corresponding singularity function assumes. The presented function in Fig. 4.11 is the 
open-ended one. Therefore we must modify it by adding two equivalent open-ended loadings. To clarify 
this statement, see Fig. 4.13.

Bending of Straight Beams
Sometimes the determination of internal forces may be cumbersome when several different types of 
loading are applied on to the beam. This can be greatly facilitated if some relations between load, shear, 
and bending moment exist. Therefore, let us now consider the simply supported straight beam subjected 
to a distributed load w, see Fig. 4.14. We detach portion DD' of the beam by two parallel sections and 
draw the free body diagram of the detached portion. The effects of the removed parts are replaced 
by internal forces at both points, namely the bending moment M and the shear force V at D, and the 
bending moment ܯ൅ȟܯ and the shear force ܸ൅ȟܸ DW '¶ at D’. This detached portion has to be 
in equilibrium, then we can write the equilibrium equations as follows

These relations between the applied load, shear force, and bending moment are known as Zhuravsky’s 
theorem (D.I. Zhuravsky, 19th century). We should also note that the sections were made from the left to 
the right side. If we make the sections in the opposite direction, the results will have the opposite sign.

Definition of Normal and Shearing Stresses
Let us consider the cantilever beam BC subjected to an applied force at its free end, see Fig. 4.15. 
Applying the step-by-step solution, we get the shear function and bending moment function as 
ܸሺݔሻൌܨ DQG ܯሺݔሻൌܨݔ respectively. These two functions represent the combined load on the 
cantilever beam. The bending moment ܯሺݔሻ represents the effect of the normal stresses in the cross-
section, while the shear force ܸሺݔሻ represents the effect of the shearing stresses. This allows us to simplify 
the determination of the normal stresses for pure bending. This is a special case when the whole beam, 
or its portion, is exerted on by only the bending moment, see the examples in Fig. 4.16.

ܯሺݔሻ=ܯ obtained by the method of section. This bending moment represents the resultant of all 
elementary forces acting on this section, see Fig. 4.17. For simplicity the bending moment considered

The rest of the equivalence equations can be obtained by setting the sum of the y components, z 
components, and moments about the x axis to be equal to zero. But these equations would involve only 
the components of shearing stress and the components of the shearing stress are both equal to zero! As 
one can see, the determination of the normal stress is a statically indeterminate problem. Therefore it 
can be obtained only by analysing the deformation of the beam.
Let us analyse the deformation of the prismatic straight beam subjected to pure bending applied in the plane 
of symmetry, see Fig 4.18. The beam will bend uniformly under the action of the couples M and M', but it 
will remain symmetric with respect to the plane of symmetry. Therefore each straight line of undeformed 
beam is transformed into the curve with constant curvature, i.e. into a circle with a common centre at C. The 
deformation analysis of the symmetric beam is based on the following assumptions proven by experiments:

From the above it follows that there must exist a neutral line (N.L.) with zero values of ߪݔ and ߝݔ. This 
neutral line represents the neutral surface (N.S) due to the uniform deformations along the cross-sectional 
width. The neutral surface intersects the plane of symmetry along the circular arc of GH, see Fig. 4.20(a), 
and intersects the transverse section along the straight line known as the neutral axis (N.A.), see  
Fig 4.20(b).
Denoting the radius of the neutral arc GH by ρ, θ becomes the central angle corresponding to GH. 
Observing that the initial length L of the undeformed member is equal to the deformed arc GH, we have
ܮൌߩߠ
 (4.16)
now consider the arc JK located at a distance y from the neutral surface, the length L’ can be expressed 
as follows
ܮԢ ൌሺߩെݕሻߠ
 (4.17)
Since the initial length of the arc JK is equal to L, then its deformation is
ȟܮൌܮǡ െܮൌሺߩെݕሻߠെߩߠൌെݕߠ
 (4.18)
and we can calculate the longitudinal strain ߝݔ as follows
ߝݔൌ
ȟܮ
ܮൌ
െݕߠ
ߩߠൌെ
ݕ
ߩ
 (4.19)
The negative sign is due to the fact that we have assumed the bending moment to be positive and thus, 
the beam to be concave upward. We can now conclude that the longitudinal strain ߝݔ varies linearly 
with distance from the neutral surface. It is only natural that the strain ߝݔ reaches its absolute maximum 
value at the furthest distance from the neutral surface ݕ݉ܽݔ, thus we get
ߝ݉ܽݔൌ
ݕ݉ܽݔ

Solving equation (4.20) for ߩ and substituting into equation (4.19) we obtain
ߝݔൌെ
ݕ
ݕ݉ܽݔߝ݉ܽݔ
 (4.21)
This result is only qualitative though, due to the fact that, until now, we have not located the neutral 
surface or neutral axis. On the other hand, we can determine the normal stress distribution function along 
the vertical axis y so we can multiply equation (4.21) by Young’s modulus E, since we are considering 
the linear elastic response, thus

This result shows that, in the elastic region, the normal stress varies linearly with the distance from the 
neutral surface as well, see Fig. 4.21. 
But still the location of the neutral surface and the maximum absolute value ߪ݉ܽݔ are unknown! 
Therefore we recall equations (4.15) and substitute for ߪݔ into the first relation and get

The last equation shows that the first moment must be equal zero, or in the sense of statics, that the 
neutral axis passes through the centre of the cross-section.

respect to the neutral axis, that coincides with the z axis. For more details about moments of inertia, see 
Appendix A. Denoting the moment of inertia by I, we have

Secondly, let us consider the effect of the shear force ܸሺݔሻ. As we mentioned before, the shear force ܸሺݔሻ 
represents the effect of the shearing stresses in the section. Let us consider the transversally loaded 
cantilever beam with a vertical plane of symmetry from Fig. 4.15. Fig. 4.22 graphically represents the 
distributions of elementary normal and shear forces on any arbitrary section of the cantilever beam. These 
elementary forces are equivalent to the bending moment ܯሺݔሻൌܨݔ and the shear force ܸሺݔሻൌܨ 
Both systems of forces are equivalent, therefore we can write the equations of equivalence. Three of them 
involve the normal force ߪݔ݀ܣ only and have already been discussed in the previous subsection, see 
equations (4.15). Three more equations involving the shearing forces ߬ݔݕ݀ܣ and ߬ݔݖ݀ܣ can now be 
written. But one of them expresses that the sum of moments about the x axis is equal to zero and it can 
be dismissed due to the symmetry with respect of the xy plane. Thus we have

Fig. 4.24
The first equation above indicates that the shearing stress must exist in the transverse section. The 
second equation shows that the average value of the horizontal shearing stress ߬ݔݖ is equal to zero. But 
this statement does not mean that the shearing stress ߬ݔݖ is zero everywhere. Again as one can see, the 
determination of the shearing stress is a statically indeterminate problem. The following assumptions 
about the distribution of the shearing stress have been formulated by Zhuravsky:
• the direction of shearing stresses are parallel to the shear force;
• the shearing stresses acting on the surface at the distance y1 from the neutral surface are 
uniform, see Fig. 4.23.
The existence of shearing can be proven by the shear law. Let us build our cantilever beam from two 
portions that are clamped together, see Fig. 4.24(a). The cantilever beam is divided into two portions 
at the neutral surface GH. After applying a load F each portion will slide with respect to each other, 
see Fig. 4.24(b). In contrast, the free end of the solid cantilever beam is smooth after the deformation; 
see Fig. 4.24(c). To obtain the same response, i.e. the smooth end for the clamped cantilever beam, we 
must insert additional forces between portions to conserve the constant length of both arches GH and 
G'H'; see Fig. 4.24(d). This represents the existence of shearing stresses on the neutral surface and the 
perpendicular cross-section (along the neutral axis).

For determining the shearing stress at a distance y1 from the neutral surface, we can detach a small 
portion C'D'DC with length dx at the distance xx from the free end of the cantilever beam, see Fig.

If we apply equations (4.39) for determining the distribution of shearing stresses ߬ݔݕ along the vertical

function presented in Fig. 4.27. The discontinuity of the distribution function is caused by the jump in 
width at the connection of the flange to the web.

Design of Straight Prismatic Beams
The design of straight prismatic beams is usually controlled by the maximum absolute value of the 
bending moment ܯ݉ܽݔ in the beam. This value can be found from the bending moment diagram. The 
point with the absolute maximum value of bending moment ܯ݉ܽݔ is known as the critical point of a 
beam. At the critical point the maximum normal stress can be calculated as follows

Then we need to check our design in respect to the absolute maximum value of the shear force ܸ݉ܽݔ 
obtained from the shear diagram. The reason is simple; the maximum absolute value of the normal 
stress is either on the top or the bottom of the section considered and the absolute value of the shearing 
stress is on the neutral axis, see Fig. 4.29. Therefore the shear strength condition ߬݉ܽݔ൑߬ܣ݈݈ must be

The last step is more complicated, mainly for W-beams. If we draw the distribution functions of the 
normal and shearing stresses, see Fig. 4.30, the critical point will be at the connection between the flange 
and the web. At point ܥܴ, combined loading exists with relatively high values of both stresses. Therefore 
we need to discuss the strength criterion of combined loading.
Fig. 4.31
Fig. 3.32
Fig. 3.33
For deriving the strength criterion of combined loading, we first have to analyse the stress transformation. 
For simplicity let us consider a plane stress state at any arbitrary point ܳ defined by two normal stresses 
ߪݔǡ ߪݕ and one shearing component ߬ݔݕ, see Fig. 4.31. The plane μ is characterised by stress components 
and the plane ߥ is characterised by stress components ߪݕǡ ߬ݔݕ. These planes correspond to the ݔǡ ݕ 
coordinate system. Now our task is to determine the normal and shearing stresses at any arbitrary plane 
η, see Fig. 4.32. Making a section by plane η we get the triangle from the unit square, see Fig. 4.33. This 
triangle must also be in equilibrium and by inserting the normal stress σ and the shearing stress  τ into 
the plane η we can write the equilibrium equations

The Mohr circle has four important points denoted by B, C, and D, see Fig. 4.35. Point A represents the 
plane which has the maximum normal stress ߪ݉ܽݔൌߪܣ ; Point B represents the plane with minimum 
normal stress ߪ݉݅݊ൌߪܤ and points C, D represent the planes with maximum shearing stress ߬݉ܽݔ. 
Mathematically we have

Fig. 4.36
The plane A contains the normal stress ߪܣ and zero shearing stress. This plane is known as the principal 
plane and the corresponding normal stress as the principal stress. Plane B is also a principal plane with 
a principal stress ߪܤ. Planes C, D are known as the planes of maximum shearing stresses. The position of 
plane μ in Mohr’s circle depends on the value of the corresponding normal stress σ and the orientation 
of the shearing stress τ. If the shearing stress tends to rotate the element in a clockwise manner, the 
point on Mohr’s circle corresponding to that face is located above the σ axis. If the shearing stress tends 
to rotate the element counterclockwise, the point on Mohr’s circle corresponding to that face is located 
below the σ axis, see Fig. 4.36. In our case (Fig. 3.32) the shearing stress ߬ݔݕ in the plane μ tends to 
rotate the element counterclockwise, so the plane is located below the σ axis, see Fig. 4.37. Pointing out 
the difference between the unit square and Mohr’s circle, the angle θ in the unit square is doubled in 
Mohr’s circle. Therefore we have to rotate the plane μ by 2θ in the same direction to get plane η, see

The experimental observations show that the failure of brittle materials depends strongly on the maximum 
normal stress, i.e. they fail suddenly without any yielding prior. Therefore it is natural that we compare 
the ultimate normal stress caused by simple uniaxial loading ߪܷ to the maximum normal stress for a 
given spatial stress state, i.e. with the maximum principal stress ߪܣ

This equation is known as Coulomb’s criterion (Ch. Coulomb 1736–1806).

For ductile materials this criterion doesn’t apply therefore we must compare other quantities. Usually we 
compare the strain energies which is the energy accumulated in the body during the deformation process 
with no dissipation (no internal sources of energy). Firstly, we derive the strain energy for a member BC 
in tension, see Fig. 4.39. Since there is no dissipation during the deformation process, the strain energy 
U is equal to the work done by the external forces W

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

the local maximum values. At point I we have the maximum bending moment while the transversal 
load is zero. At point II we have a nonzero bending moment and the maximum transversal load. We 
will control the rectangular cross-section area at both points. 
Von Mises stress at point I in Fig. 4.50.
At this location we only have a nonzero maximum value of the bending moment. At this point we have

(a) the equation defining the transversal and normal (axial) load and bending moment at any point
We have a beam with a free end. From the free end, we have constant cross-section area, constant bending 
moment, transversal load, and normal load. Thus we do not need to find the reactions at the support. 
The division into the parts is shown in the Fig. 4.73.

Bending of Straight Beams
Problem 4.7

 Fig. 4.87
For the beam in Fig. 4.87 determine the maximum values of bending moment, torque, and transversal 
load. Draw the diagram of bending moment, torque and transversal load and check the circular cross-
section for strength using Mises criterion. The length L, a, diameter D, force F, and allowable stress σall 
are given. 
Solution
 Fig. 4.88
The equivalent force system is determined by the torque T and the transversal load F shown in Fig. 4.88. 
After this transformation we have a cantilever beam, which has a T = Fa and force F at its free end, see 
Fig. 4.89 (last view).
This problem is a combination of torsion and bending. The solution is to divide the problem into two 
parts, the torsion solution and bending solution. Then we sum the results from both parts.

Deflection of Beams
5	 Deflection of Beams
5.1	
Introduction
In the previous Section we talked about the stress and strain analyses of beams under transverse loading. 
Safe design requires that we satisfy not only the strength criteria but also the deformation response. The 
deformation response involves the acceptable strains, deflections and slopes which fit the requirements of 
the structure. Deriving the formula for calculating the radius of curvature of the neutral surface we have
ͳ
ߩൌ
ܯሺݔሻ
ܧܫ
(5.1)
This equation is valid if Saint Venant’s principle is satisfied for a beam transversely loaded. The bending 
moment varies from section to section and therefore the curvature of the neutral surface will vary as well.
This will constitute the basis for the integration method used to calculate deflections and slopes. There 
are several other methods based on different approaches like the energy method (Castigliano’s theorem). 
Both methods are discussed in this Chapter.
5.2	
Integration method
 Fig. 5.1 Cantilever beam
Equation (5.1) represents information about the shape of the deformed beam only, for example consider 
the cantilever beam BC of length L acted on by the applied load F, see Fig. 5.1. Usually the analysis and 
design of such a beam would require more precise information about the beam’s deformation, i.e. detailed 
information about the deflection and the slope at various points of the beam. The problem of calculating 
the maximum deflection has particular importance in beam design. Therefore our task is to find any 
relation between the position of an arbitrary point, determined by the distance x from the end of the 
beam, and the deflection y measured from the axis of the undeformed beam at this point, see Fig 5.2.

where dy/dx and d2y/dx2 are the first and second derivatives of the function y(x) representing the 
elastic curve. Assuming the elastic response to loading, we can expect a very small value of beam slope  
θ(x)=dy/dx and its square is negligible compared to unity. Thus we get

The equation obtained is a second-order linear differential equation; it is the governing differential 
equation for the elastic curve. Using the double integration in x for this differential equation we will obtain 
the elastic curve. For the prismatic beam we can consider the constant flexural rigidity EI so we have

solutions. To obtain the solution for the beam considered we need to apply boundary conditions, or 
more precisely, from the conditions imposed on the beam by its supports. In this Section we will limit 
ourselves to statically determinate beams, i.e. the corresponding reactions can be determined my methods 
of statics directly. Possible boundary conditions are presented in Fig. 5.3.

Deflection of Beams
 Fig. 5.4 Simply supported beam
The problem of searching for the maximum deflection can be mathematically formulated as the problem 
of searching for the maximum value within the interval. For example in Fig. 5.1 the maximum deflection 
is at the free end of the cantilever beam.
Let us consider the simply supported beam BC of length L, see Fig. 5.4. Our task is to calculate the 
deflection at point D. The solution can be obtained using the step-by-step approach, see Chapter 1. Thus 
we get ܴܤൌ

Castigliano’s Theorem
 Fig. 5.6
Let us consider the simply supported beam BC of length L acted on by two concentrated forces F1 and 
F2 at points D1 and D2, see Fig. 5.6. The strain energy accumulated in the beam is equal to the work 
done by the applied forces since they are applied slowly. To evaluate this work we need to first express 
the deflections y1 and y2 in terms of the loads F1 and F2.

To compute the work done by forces F1 and F2 and thus the strain energy of the beam, it is convenient

Thus we can conclude that the deflection produced at D1 by the unit load applied at D2 is equal to the 
deflection produced at D2 by the unit load applied at D1. This is known as Maxwell’s reciprocal theorem 
(Maxwell 1831–1879). 
Now differentiating equation (5.11) with respect to F1 we get

Deflection of Beams
In the previous Section we have discussed Castigliano’s theorem that is based on the determination of the 
strain energy. The strain energy has been defined in Chapter 4. The individual strain energies for each 
basic loading are presented in Appendix A. Then using the principle of superposition we can express 
the total accumulated strain energy as the sum of individual energies accumulated for each load in the 
structure, i.e.
ܷൌܷܯ൅ܷܸ൅ܷܶ൅ܷܰ
 (5.16)
where ܷܯǡ ܷܸǡ ܷܶǡ ܷܰ are strain energies caused by the bending moments, shear forces, torques and 
normal forces.
Let us consider the cantilever beam BC of length L subjected to the distributed load w, see Fig. 5.12. 
Our task is to calculate the deflection and the slope at its free end B. Castigliano’s theorem can not be 
apply directly, because there are no concentrated forces, nor is there any applied couple at point B. To 
overcome this problem we apply a fictitious or dummy load in the required direction. Thus we can 
calculate the deflection as follows
߲ܷ
߲ܳൌݕܳ
 (5.17)
 Fig. 5.13
Then making ܳൌͲ in this equation, the deflection reaches a value corresponding to the given load. 
In our case we can apply a fictitious downwards force ܳܤ at point B, see Fig. 5.13. Then the bending 
moment distribution function is

Statically Indeterminate Beams
Statically indeterminate problems can be solved in the usual way by removing the redundant supports 
and replacing them by unknown reactions. Then we can apply the step-by-step approach for determining 
internal force distribution functions. But these functions involve unknown reactions. To determine those 
reactions we can apply deformation conditions that correspond to the removed supports.
Let us consider the cantilever beam BC with a length L subjected to the distributed load w, see Fig. 5.15. 
The presented beam is statically indeterminate to the first degree. We replace the redundant support at B 
by the unknown reaction ܴܤ. To get the same deformation response we need to impose the deformation 
condition

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Problem 5.10
 Fig. 5.50
For the uniformly loaded beam shown in Fig. 5.50, determine (a) the reaction at support B applying 
both Castigliano’s theorem and the integration method, (b) the reaction at support B and using the 
singularity function.
Solution
This problem is a statically indeterminate one. For its solution we need the boundary condition, which 
states that the deflection at point B is equal to zero, because in this point we have a rigid support. This 
support can then be replaced with the unknown reaction RB, see Fig. 5.51.

For the beam with the load shown in Fig. 5.55 determine, (a) the reaction at all supports by using 
Castigliano’s theorem, (b) draw the diagram of bending moment and transversal load.
Solution
The problem is statically indeterminate so we first exchange the support at point C with an unknown 
reaction RC. This reaction is found from the deformation condition, which says that the deflection at 
point C is equal to zero (yC = 0). (See Fig. 5.56).

This problem is statically indeterminate so we must convert it to the statically determinate problem by 
representing the roller support by an unknown reaction RB in Fig. 5.62. We find this reaction from the 
boundary condition that the deflection in this point is equal to zero.

Introduction
Until now we have dealt with the analysis of stress and strain in structures acted on by specified loads 
without any unacceptable deformations in the elastic region. Sometimes the structure can suddenly 
change its configuration at a certain load level. After removing the load, the structure will return to its 
initial configuration according to the condition of elastic response. The sudden change in configuration 
represents the unstable mode of the structure deformation. To exclude unstable modes of deformations, 
we need to gain knowledge about the stability of structures. That is, to determine the critical load which 
corresponds to the initiation of the unstable deformation modes.
In this Chapter we are going to analyse only simple structures, in our case columns.

Stability of Structures
 Fig. 6.1
Let us consider a column BC of length L with a pin connection at both ends, see Fig. 6.1. This column 
is acted on by the centric axial compressive force F. Let us suppose that the design of the considered 
column satisfies the strength condition ߪ݉ܽݔ൑ߪܣ݈݈ and its deformation ȟܮൌܨܮܧܣ
Τ
 falls within 
the given specification. What this means is that the column is designed properly. However, it might 
happen that the column will lose stability and buckle and instead of remaining straight it will suddenly 
curve sharply, see Fig. 6.2.

To understand the process of buckling, let us build a simple model of our column BC. This column 
consists of two rigid rods BD and CD connected together at point D by a pin and the torsional spring 
characterised by the spring constant K, see Fig. 6.3. If the applied load is perfectly aligned with the rods, 
the presented system remains straight and stable, see Fig. 6.4(a). But if we move point D to the right 
slightly, the rods will form a small angle ∆θ, see Fig. 6.4(b). This state is unstable because, after removing 
the applied load, the system will return to the initial stable mode by the action of the torsional spring. 
It is not possible to find the critical load FCR from the unbuckled state, therefore we must analyse the 
buckled structure. For simplicity let us consider rod CD only, see Fig. 6.5. We can observe two couples 
acting on the rod considered, namely the couple caused by forces F and F' and the couple ܯൌܭʹȟߠ 
exerted by the spring. If the couple of forces F and F' is smaller than the couple M, then the system 
tends to be in its initial stable configuration, i.e. in the equilibrium position. If couple M is smaller than 
the force couple F and F', then the system tends to move away from the equilibrium position to the 
unstable configuration. If both couples are in equilibrium, then the corresponding load is the critical 
load FCR. Then we can write

Let us consider the column BC of the length L with a pin connection at both ends, see Fig. 6.1 again. 
This column is subjected to the centric axial compressive force F. Our task is to determine the critical 
load FCR, which causes buckling. Therefore we need to analyse the deformed rod, see Fig. 6.6. It can be 
assumed that the column is a vertical beam. Then, applying the step-by-step approach, we can determine 
the internal forces acting at the arbitrary point Q. The shape of the buckled column can be described as 
an elastic curve. Mathematically we get

Let us consider a column BC of length L, fixed at C, and free at B, see Fig. 6.7. In this case we observe 
that the column will behave like the upper part of the pin-ended column with an effective length of 
ܮ݁ൌʹܮ, and an effective slenderness ratio of λe = 2L/r.
Now considering the column BC of length L with both ends fixed, see Fig. 6.8. Then, due to the horizontal 
symmetry at the point ܦ, we get horizontal reactions at the supports which must be equal to zero. The 
vertical tangents at points B, C, D to the elastic curve have zero slopes. Therefore there exists two inflexion 
points E, F, where the bending moments are equal to zero, see Fig. 6.9. For the pin-ended column, the 
bending moments at the supports are equal to zero too. Thus portion EF of the column behaves like the 
pin-ended column with an effective length of Le = L/2, and an effective slenderness ratio of  λe = L/2r.
 Fig. 6.9
Finally let us consider column BC of length L with one fixed end C and one pinned end B, see Fig. 
6.10. In this case we must write the differential equation of the elastic curve in order to determine the 
effective length. Therefore drawing the free body diagram with corresponding boundary equations, see 
Fig. 6.11, then applying the method of section in order to obtain the bending moment at any arbitrary 
point Q, we have

This equation shows that the critical stress is proportional to Young’s modulus of the column material, 
and inversely proportional to the square of the slenderness ratio of the column. For a certain material, 
i.e. for a given Young’s modulus, we will get the plot of the critical stress versus the slenderness ratio, 
see Fig. 6.13. It is clear that for short columns, with low slenderness ratios, that the critical stress can 
exceed both: the ultimate stress and the yield stress before reaching Euler’s critical stress. Therefore we 
must modify the plot of the critical stress versus the slenderness ratio. For the illustration let us consider 
steel with a Young’s modulus of ܧൌʹͳͲܩܲܽ, the ultimate stress ߪܷൌͳͻͲܯܲܽ, and the yield stress

If the current stress is greater than the critical stress ߪܿݎ, i.e. ߣ൏ߣ݉݅݊, then the material behaviour is 
not elastic and we cannot apply Euler’s formula. For short columns which ߣ൏ߣ݉݅݊, the critical load 
ܨܿݎ is determined empirically using experimental results. These experimental results can be approximated 
by Tetmayer’s curve (L. Tetmayer 1850–1905)
ߪܿݎൌܽെߣܾ
(6.28)
where ܽǡ ܾ are the material constants. Then we get the limit curve of the critical stress versus the 
slenderness ratio consisting of three regions, see Fig. 6.14. Region 1, limited by the yielding stress ߪݕ, 
is valid for short columns. Region 2, limited by Tetmayer’s curve, is valid for intermediate columns and 
region 3, limited by Euler’s curve, is valid for long columns.
For the design of columns, we apply the buckling coefficients. These coefficients are determined by STN 
standards for a given material with a corresponding slenderness ratio. Thus the strength condition

In this section we discuss the design of columns undergoing eccentric loading. Let us consider an eccentric 
load applied in the plane of a column’s symmetry at an eccentricity of e, see Fig. 6.15. This eccentric load 
F can be replaced with the axial force F and the couple M = Fe. Then the normal stress exerted on the 
transverse section of the considered column can be expressed by superposing the axial load F and the 
couple M, see Fig. 6.16. This is valid only if the conditions of Saint Venant’s principle are satisfied and 
as long as the stresses involved do not exceed the proportional limit of the material. We can then write 
the stress caused by the eccentric load to be

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The allowable stress method. This method is based on the assumption that the allowable stress for centric

When an eccentric load is applied outside of the plane of symmetry, it causes bending about two principal 
axes, see Fig. 6.17. We then have a centric load F and two couples My and Mz. Thus the interaction 
formula can then be modified as

Equation (e) requires that either y0 = 0 or coskL

hence no buckling (Fig. 6.18). If coskL

deflection y0 remains indeterminate and, for the ideal case, can have any value within the scope of small 
deflection theory.
The smallest value of kL which satisfies Eq. (e) is obtained by taking n = 1. The corresponding value of 
F will be the smallest critical load, and we have

Problem 6.2
Fig. 6.20
The steel column is fixed at its bottom and is braced at its top by cables so as to prevent movement at 
the top along the y axis, Fig. 6.20. If it is assumed to be fixed at its base, determine the largest allowable 
load F that can be applied. Use a factor of safety for buckling of F.S. = 2.5. Assume the parameters: E = 
200 GPa, σY = 250 MPa, L = 6 m, b = 50 mm, h = 100 mm.
Solution

When an area possesses an axis of symmetry, the first moment of the area with respect to that axis is zero.
Considering an area A, such as the trapezoidal area shown in Fig. A.3, we may dividethe area into 
simple geometric shapes. The solution of the first moment Qz of the area with respect to the z axis can 
be divided into components A1, A2, and we can write

Parallel axis theorem

Fig. A.13
Considering the moment of inertia Iz of an area A with respect to an arbitrary z axis (Fig. A.13). Let us 
now draw the centroidal z’ axis, i.e., the axis parallel to the z axis which passes though the area’s centroid 
C. Denoting the distance between the element dA and axis passes though the centroid Cby y’, we write 
y = y’ + d. Substituting for y in Eq. (A.6), we write

The first step of the solution is to locate the centroid C of the area. However, this has already been done 
in Example A.02 for a given area A.
We divide the area A into two rectangular areas A1 and A2 (Fig. A.15) and compute the moment of

(A.20a)
in which each element of area dA is multiplied by the product of its coordinates and integration is 
extended over the entire area A of a plane figure. If a cross-section area has an axis of symmetry which 
is taken for the y or z axis (Fig. A.19), the product of inertia is equal to zero. In the general case, for 
any point of any cross-section area, we can always find two perpendicular axes such that the product 
of inertia for these vanishes. If this quantity becomes zero, the axes in these directions are called the 
principal axes. Usually the centroid is taken as the origin of coordinates and the corresponding principal 
axes are then called the centroidal principal axes.

Strain energy for simple loads
Fig. A.20
Consider a rod BC of length L and uniform cross-section area A, attached at B to a fixed support. The 
rod is subjected to a slowly increasing axial load F at C (Fig. A.20). The work done by the load F as it is 
slowly applied to the rod must result in the increase of some energy associated with the deformation of 
the rod. This energy is referred to as the strain energy of the rod. Which is defined by

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

It can be seen that the result of this ratio will increasing as L decreases. However, even for short beams, 
where, say L = 5 h, the contribution due to shear strain energy is only 3.6% of the bending strain energy. 
For this reason, the shear strain energy stored in beams is usually neglected in engineering analysis.
