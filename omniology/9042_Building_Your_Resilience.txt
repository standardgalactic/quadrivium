hether you are healing from adversity or looking to prepare yourself 
for those inevitable moments of life when your resilience is tested, 
this course can help. Over 24 classes, this course explores the 
philosophical, scientific, and practical ways you can live a resilient, inspired life.
Classes investigate resilience from physical, mental, and emotional perspectives, 
and they discuss specific strategies you can use to rewire your brain and navigate 
life’s challenges with more clarity and ease. You’ll learn how stress and trauma 
affect the body and mind, and what you can do to reverse its potentially 
damaging effects. You’ll also find out what tools really help to promote 
resilience, from the ancient archetype of the hero’s journey to cutting-edge 
research on post-traumatic growth. 
Along the way, true stories of resilience will provide inspiration and insight 
into people’s ability to discover wisdom and meaning in adversity. The course 
also includes information on clinically researched coping skills and self-care 
techniques that can be used to build resilience. 
You’ll also be offered seven practice classes, giving you the opportunity to build 
your resilience in real time. The practice classes include resilience-building 
breathing exercises, movement practices, and guided meditations that will bring 
the teachings right into your home. The practice classes incorporate multilevel 
instruction, making them accessible for most people. 
This guidebook also includes the course’s Resilience Self-Evaluation Tool, which 
will help you explore how your strengths have successfully helped you surmount 
challenges in the past as well as discover areas for growth that may need some

extra attention. Each facet of this course works together to help you evaluate your 
resilience, learn new skills, and apply newfound wisdom to your own life. 

The Foundation 
of Resilience
Class 1
T
o get the most out of this course, it is strongly recommended that you 
use the Resilience Self-Evaluation Tool in the guidebook after viewing or 
listening to the first class. When you finish the course, go back and take 
the self-evaluation again to see what has changed, what you’ve learned, and if 
you see areas for future growth. You can take it as many times as you would like 
as you move through life. It provides a valuable way to check in with yourself 
several times a year to ensure you are staying resilient during the changing 
seasons of life.
The self-evaluation is centered on eight themes of resilience: 
1.	 Core values and purpose. 
2.	 Finding meaning in adversity. 
3.	 Equanimity. 

4  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
4.	 Self-care.
5.	 Healthy coping skills. 
6.	 Having a positive sense of self. 
7.	 Support and connection with others. 
8.	 Having a proactive worldview. 
These eight themes are the foundation of your brain and body’s resilience. The 
remainder of this guidebook chapter provides an orientation regarding each. 
Core Values and Purpose
Core values are the bedrock of resilience. If you haven’t spent a lot of time 
thinking about what your core values are, try doing so. It can help to spend 
time really feeling why these values matter as well as how they are brought to 
life through your actions. 
Living close to your core values can be a very clarifying and strengthening 
experience. It can also make life easier. Then next time you are faced with a 
big decision, you can use your core values as a touchstone: Which choice best 
honors your core values? 
Core values can also help you define your 
purpose in life. They can empower the roles you 
play in life, whether as a parent, a community 
member, or an employee. For instance, if one of 
your core values is selfless love, being a parent is 
a beautiful place to practice this virtue. 
Viewing adversity as 
an opportunity is what 
takes people out of the 
victim mentality and 
empowers them to be 
survivors and makers 
of change. 

Class 1 | The Foundation of Resilience  |  5
Finding Meaning in Adversity
The next theme you will find throughout the course is the importance of 
finding meaning in adversity. Traumas in life are defined by a loss of control or 
a shattering of one’s former paradigm. 
However, struggles can force you to engage with life’s most important questions. 
Your suffering can make you compassionate and give you the opportunity to 
care and feel deeply. Try sitting with a belief that instead of life happening to 
you, life is happening for you. Welcoming alleviates suffering. 
Equanimity
The third theme you will find throughout this course is equanimity, which can 
be defined as “evenness of mind” or “mental composure.” Ideally, you want to 
be able to maintain a state of mental calmness, even in the midst of challenging 
situations. The ability to maintain equanimity is something you can cultivate 
through practices like meditation, breathing, mindfulness, and yoga. 
True equanimity is found in learning to ride the waves of life with a sense of 
openness and curiosity. Doing so requires learning to manage your emotional 
states and maintain a healthy connection between body and mind. 
Self-Care
Self-care means maintaining your energy reserves by regularly taking care of 
your physical, emotional, and mental needs. This is essential to staying healthy 
and strong in an enduring way. 
Self-care activities include exercise, breathing, meditation, eating healthy, taking 
time to relax, devoting time to your spiritual practice of choice, keeping a 
positive mindset, and sleep. Self-care can also include measures like spending 
time with loved ones, setting appropriate boundaries, and participating in 
activities that lift you up instead of holding you back.

6  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Healthy Coping Skills 
Coping skills involve taking care of yourself in response to stress. Having a set 
of healthy coping skills includes measures like the aforementioned self-care 
practices. It also includes having trusted friends and advisors, using humor, 
deep breathing, and learning to observe your emotions, which are essential to 
navigating difficulties. 	
Typically, when people stop using healthy coping mechanisms, they start using 
unhealthy coping mechanisms, like drinking, smoking, drugs, gambling, or 
unhealthy sex habits. These unhealthy coping mechanisms can create more 
problems than the issues they are trying to resolve. If you find yourself turning 
to these unhealthy coping mechanisms, it’s an important sign you need to amp 
up your self-care practices and start using some of your healthier coping skills.
Investing time and 
energy to build 
healthy self-care 
practices is like 
investing money in 
the bank so that it 
is there when you 
need to draw on it. 

Class 1 | The Foundation of Resilience  |  7
Having a Positive Sense of Self 
Having a positive sense of self is the next theme of resilience. Unfortunately, 
many people pin their identities on their outside persona, which is a vulnerable 
place to put one’s sense of self-worth. For example, if someone ties her self-
worth to her career, a professional setback could destroy her sense of self-worth. 
Cultivating a healthy sense of self requires actively learning to listen to and 
love yourself. Having a healthy sense of self-worth is built upon understanding 
who you are on the inside, having a connection with yourself, and spending 
regular time cultivating that connection through activities like meditation 
and mindfulness. 
Keep in mind that this does not mean thinking that you are better than others, 
which is a certain sign that someone suffers from a lack of confidence. 
Support and Connection with Others
Having a support system and a healthy connection with others can strengthen 
nearly every aspect of resilience. Knowing you have people you can lean on for 
support and reaching out to them—both in good times and in moments when 
you need help—is essential for thriving amidst adversity. 
Having people in your life you can trust can provide a tremendous sense of courage 
and freedom to step outside your comfort zone and try new things. A healthy 
community provides a sense of security and comfort in an uncertain world. 
Sometimes, individuals want to only be the person who helps other people, but 
it is also extremely important to be someone who is authentic and vulnerable 
about the times when you need help. When you are honest about your reality, 
you open the door for others to be vulnerable and authentic as well. This is 
the place where true connection occurs. There is tremendous freedom in being 
honest and being able to both give and receive help.

8  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Having a Proactive Worldview 
The eighth theme of resilience is having a proactive worldview. Though it can 
be easy to feel like a powerless victim in a massive, violent, confusing world, 
there is one thing you can affect: your perspective and state of mind. No one 
can take this away from you. You may not be able to change situations, but you 
always have the ability to change how you respond to situations. 
It is important to be deeply grounded in your own personal truths while at 
the same time having psychological flexibility to adapt to changes that are 
constantly arising. A balance between the two can help you feel that you are 
safe in yourself and that you also have the ability to adapt and adjust in the face 
of new information. When you combine that with a sense of perseverance and 
determination, you can completely change the way you approach adversity in 
your life.

Class 2
The Hero’s Journey
T
he hero’s journey—a storytelling structure that can be seen in countless 
stories and screenplays—is essentially a blueprint for developing 
resilience. With this blueprint of the hero’s journey in hand, you can see 
your personal journey through life in a new way. 
There are several different versions of the steps involved in the hero’s journey. 
Joseph Campbell originally identified 17 stages, but this class follows the model 
that Christopher Vogler develops in his book The Writer’s Journey, which distills 
the monomyth down to 12 steps. You can also think of the hero’s journey as 
having three actions: the separation, the initiation, and the return. Keep in 
mind that these phases may occur externally or internally for the hero. They 
may be physical, emotional, spiritual, or all three.

Class 2 | The Hero’s Journey  |  11
Step 1: The Ordinary World
●
●The first step is called the ordinary world. It begins amidst everyday 
life, with the hero unaware of the adventures that wait ahead. 
●
●This context is necessary to understand the hero, as it often includes 
a glimpse into what day-to-day life is like as well as a general 
understanding of the hero’s personality. The humanity of the hero is 
present, which includes an honest reflection of both their strengths 
and their limitations. 
●
●Amidst this experience of the hero’s normal life, there is often a sense 
of foreboding. The problem is not yet evident, but it can be felt on 
the horizon. 

12  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Step 2: The Call to Adventure
●
●The next step is the call to adventure. During this stage, the need to 
change becomes clear either through a shift in perspective or a direct 
call to action. Life as usual cannot continue. 
●
●Often, the call to adventure is something traumatic, like a sudden 
life change, accident, threat, loss of a loved one, change in career, or 
something that jeopardizes the well-being of the hero, their family, or 
community. It can also be the revelation of the source of a problem 
that has been bothering the hero for some time.
Step 3: The Refusal of the Call
●
●The third step is the refusal of the call. Here, the hero is apprehensive 
about the call to adventure. Fears begin to arise, regardless of whether 
the hero is excited for the adventure or resistant to change. 
●
●The hero may start to question himself or herself, or have second 
thoughts about the life changes. Feelings may arise of not wanting to 
leave the comforts of life, home, or the familiar. 
Step 4: Meeting the Mentor
●
●The fourth stage involves meeting the mentor, which serves as 
an empowering moment in the story. What might have seemed 
impossible alone suddenly seems possible with the guidance and 
wisdom of someone who has walked the path before. 
●
●The mentor may serve many roles. The mentor may see possibilities 
in the hero that the hero cannot see, which creates a bridge for the 
hero to walk across. The mentor may have practical tools that the hero 
can use on their journey. They may offer training, insights, or wisdom 
for the journey ahead. The mentor often has a unique way of seeing 
life that shifts the hero’s worldview. 

Class 2 | The Hero’s Journey  |  13
Step 5: Crossing the Threshold
●
●With the empowerment given by the mentor, the hero is able to find 
enough peace and strength amidst their fears to embark on the next step: 
crossing the threshold. The threshold symbolizes leaving behind the world 
the hero is comfortable with and stepping into the unknown ahead. 
●
●Sometimes, the hero will have no choice. Other times, the hero will 
bravely, yet with some reluctance, begin from his or her own initiative. 
With this step, the hero commits to the quest, knowing it will not be 
easy. However, the hero also knows it is not possible to go back to life as it 
was before. The hero must let go of some of their questions to move on. 
Step 6: Tests, Allies, and Enemies
●
●The sixth step—tests, allies, and enemies—involves the hero beginning 
to feel out their new reality. They have fully emerged out of their former 
life and into the next phase, where they are inevitably confronted with 
tests that challenge their previous perceptions. It may be that they have to 
unlearn what they knew before so that they can then learn something new. 
●
●Here, the hero’s former self is being challenged. Obstacles are thrown 
at the hero. Amidst the process of navigating these challenges, the 
hero attempts to discover who their allies and enemies are. Both the 
allies and the enemies teach the hero lessons of some kind, which 
become part of what prepares them for the future. 
●
●In this phase of the hero’s journey, each obstacle prepares the hero in some 
way for what is to come. The hero learns about their unique skills and gains a 
deeper wisdom about how they can affect change in the world around them. 
Step 7: The Approach to the Inmost Cave
●
●During the seventh step, the approach to the inmost cave, the hero 
feels like they are approaching the place of greatest threat or evil. The 

14  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
cave represents everything that the hero fears most. Symbolically, it is 
clear that the biggest threats of all are the fears they bring with them 
into the cave. Here, the hero often learns the hard way that anger, fear, 
and aggression must be abandoned in order to keep growing. 
●
●This phase often involves some self-reflection to use the lessons learned 
along the journey to confront their original fears and to uncover the 
courage they will need for what is to come. Innately, the hero knows 
they will be tested in a way they never have been before.
Step 8: The Ordeal, Death, and Rebirth
●
●During the eighth stage—the ordeal, death, and rebirth—the hero 
encounters a difficult foe and learns that there is no fast or easy way 
out. They must uncover a deeper belief in themselves than they have 
ever had before to win this battle. 
●
●Often they must put down the tools they thought would help them, 
including the tools they have used in the past, when they find that 
they are useless against this, their biggest challenge. Winning this 
battle requires something new.
●
●The challenge in the ordeal stage can be an internal struggle against 
the hero’s biggest fear. It can be a physical test or a confrontation with 
their biggest enemy. It may even be a combination of these. 
●
●All of the resources, wisdom, and skill that the hero has collected 
along the journey are needed to make it through the ordeal. The 
former self of the hero must die in order for the new version of the 
self to come forth. 
Step 9: The Reward
●
●The ninth step is the reward stage. Here, the hero transcends their 
lower self to reach a higher state of being. They rise with renewed 

Class 2 | The Hero’s Journey  |  15
power, intuition, and strength, along with deeper wisdom and a 
broadened view of possibilities. 
●
●Often, the hero comes out of their battle with a prize or reward for their 
efforts. This prize can take many forms, depending upon the nature 
of the battle. It can be a greater sense of peace, purpose, and meaning 
in their life. It might be a deeper relationship with a loved one, a new 
career, a romance, or a new chance at life. The reward is in some way the 
missing piece they need to return again to the ordinary world.
Step 10: The Road Back
●
●The next step involves walking the road back home and over the 
threshold crossed when the journey began. Think back to the fear 
present as the hero left the familiarity of their former life as they made 
their way into the unknown. Now, they are walking back across the 
threshold in the other direction with a sense of triumph and a renewed 
sense of excitement and enthusiasm for life. 
●
●On the road back, the hero must evaluate how they return to life so that 
they do not slip back into the way things used to be. The hero must 
integrate their new insights into the ordinary world—a world that may 
not have changed at all while they themselves have changed so profoundly.
Step 11: Resurrection
●
●In the penultimate step—resurrection—the biggest challenge yet 
arises, even though the hero may have thought that the return would 
be filled with triumph and ease. The hero must face the ultimate 
encounter with their biggest fears and even the possibility of their 
own death, which includes the death of their former self. 
●
●The hero, who was born amidst the adventure and who has now 
earned new merits, dies if they return to the life they led before. The 
hero cannot keep their new wisdom just for themselves, or they will 

16  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
suffer tremendously. The wisdom dies if not kept alive through the 
hero’s thoughts, words, and deeds. The hero must shed their former 
skin and fully embrace the expansiveness of their new reality. 
Step 12: The Return with the Elixir
●
●During the final step, the return with the elixir, the hero steps fully into 
their new truth and embodies it in the ordinary world. It is a world that 
no longer seems as ordinary as the hero had once thought it to be. 
●
●During this phase, the hero realizes the full value of what he or she has 
gained. The hero then empowers other people to confront their demons, 
hardships, and bullies. The hero also learns from the people they are 
helping, finding that the hero doesn’t always have to go into the proverbial 
cave to find the dragon. The hero can find the dragon any place they still 
discover their own selfishness, anger, greed, hatred, or jealousy. 
●
●To be a true hero, one must recognize that the story is ultimately not 
about the hero being the hero. The ultimate hero’s journey teaches the 
hero how to transcend the self. A hero comes back from their journey 
with the same name and form, but the hero lets the work of their 
heart flow through them instead of thinking it is about them. 
●
●The true hero does not attach to their heroicness. The more the 
person is able to release the sense that they are the hero who is helping 
other people, the more the person will be able alleviate suffering and 
experience peace in their own heart and mind. The hero does the work 
that needs to be done while renouncing attachment to the outcome. 
Conclusion
●
●The hero’s journey provides an archetype to understand the truths 
that you can only discover by leaving your ordinary world and 
undertaking your own journey of separation, initiation, and return. 
Whether your hero’s journey occurs in the office of a good therapist, 

Class 2 | The Hero’s Journey  |  17
or on a soul-searching adventure around the world, or while healing 
in the cancer unit of a hospital, the quest to find your true self is a 
universal quest that everyone has to walk in their own way. 
●
●Each time you navigate through the hero’s journey, you receive the 
opportunity to strengthen resilience by discovering new vibrancy in life, 
new sources of wisdom and meaning, and a deeper embodiment of your 
authentic, true self. You are in the midst of your own hero’s journey now. 
Consciously understanding it will unlock new sources of resilience in you.

Activities
●
●Create your definition of a hero. 
●
●Once you’ve created your definition, ask several other people how 
they define a hero.  
●
●Look for the steps of the hero’s journey throughout your life. If it is 
helpful, you can write out the 12 steps and document the phases of 
your life in each step. You can also write out a diagram of multiple 
hero’s journey stories you have navigated throughout your life, and see 
how they intertwine together and connect with each other.
●
●You are welcome to go to Class 24 and do the hero’s journey guided 
meditation as many times as is helpful.

Class 3
The Resilient 
Human Spirit
T
here are universal principles to strengthen resilience that span centuries, 
continents, and cultures. These principles are a part of people’s individual 
and collective histories. They can be found in human physiology and 
throughout societies. While you may have been immersed in these elements 
your entire life, you can strengthen your resilience by understanding this 
inheritance that has been passed down through the ages and that still provides 
support today.
Instinct
●
●Instinct plays a role in dealing with adversity. Your instincts involve 
your inborn behaviors, thought patterns, and ways of being that are 
not learned. 

Class 3 | The Resilient Human Spirit  |  19
●
●You also have instincts that alert you to danger. People have an 
instinctual nature that has been honed over time to sense potential 
threats. However, it often takes going through a trauma to remind 
someone that this strong instinct is always available. 
●
●Another example of instincts comes from shaking: After animals go 
through something challenging, they physically shake off the trauma. 
Humans sometimes do this too. People shake with fear in the moment, 
but they can also proactively shake the body as a means of helping to 
somatically release the trauma from the body. 
●
●Trauma release exercises, or TRE, can reconnect people with the 
instinctual nature to shake off something challenging that occurred. 
Shaking or vibrating the body can be a highly effective means of 
calming the nervous system and releasing muscular tension brought 
on by stress or trauma.
When a baby comes out of the womb, the baby already knows how to 
nurse. This is a survival instinct that is carried through genetic material.

●Instinct also extends to the way people communicate and interact with 
each other. People have an inborn knowing of how to communicate 
and feel the messages others are sending, even if they are not verbal. 
●
●When a problem arises, for many people, their perception of the 
problem is the biggest obstacle. People know how to deal with 
adversity, but they may have forgotten or have narrowed their 
perspective to such a degree that they can’t see the big picture. 
●
●When you calm your brain down and learn to be present and mindful 
in the moment, you can learn to connect with a deeper instinct of 
how you are feeling and how those around you are feeling as well. 
The natural answer of what you need to do in each moment is always 
present if you are able to get perspective and listen for the answer.
●
●A potential stumbling point is intellect. Though people value intellect 
highly, it can sometimes override or block what helps a person feel 
connected to himself or herself and the world. Intellect is important, 
but it is not the entire story.
Deep Listening
●
●Cultures that are not deeply involved in technology show many 
interesting ways to deal with adversity—ways that you can adapt 
to your circumstances in a world of smartphones, social networks, 
and 24-hour news cycles. One such culture is that of the Australian 
Aboriginals, who anthropologists estimate have lived in relatively the 
same way for approximately the past 35,000 years. 
●
●The Australian Aboriginals have a word, dadirri, that translates as 
“deep listening.” It is based upon the notion that people are constantly 
trying to create balance and harmony both inside themselves and in 
the surrounding world. The Aboriginals practice dadirri both as a 
meditation and as an approach to ordinary interactions in daily life, 
constantly aiming to bring balance between the inner world and 
outer world. 

Class 3 | The Resilient Human Spirit  |  21
●
●The Aboriginals do not see themselves as separate beings. If there is 
disharmony outside of them, in their family or tribe, they assume 
that there must also be disharmony inside of them. They see how the 
individual affects the whole and how the whole affects the individual. 
Dadirri is a means of listening and feeling for what will create harmony 
and connection where there was separation or imbalance.
●
●When the Aboriginals have a problem, they listen for the answer. 
When they perceive illness or emotional upset in themselves, another 
person, or the world around them, they look for where they are not 
connecting with the whole to discover where disharmony or unease is 
occurring. They then listen for how they can help bring balance to the 
situation and let their actions reflect this.
The Golden Rule
As you seek to create balance between yourself and the world around 
you, the golden rule of treating others as you want to be treated is the 
perfect place to start. 
Rites of Passage
●
●The use of rites of passage is one of the most important ways humans 
have navigated adversity. Both traditionally and still to the present day, 
unique stages and transitions in life—including birth, adolescence, 
marriage, and death—are marked by ceremonies or rituals. Ideally, 
these rites of passage are used as a means of supporting an individual 
or group as they embark on a new phase of life.
●
●Native Americans use rites of passage in very powerful ways. For 
example, when Native Americans went to war, the hero’s journey 
was laid out. It is fascinating how these ancient cultures realized the 
importance of community and support to empower someone to 
navigate adversity. 

22  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●When the warriors were preparing to go into battle, tribes would 
create elaborate ceremonies. Members of the tribe would wear 
colorful and symbolic ceremonial dress. Likewise, the warriors would 
don war paint, decorate themselves, and prepare their weapons. The 
ceremonial ways in which they were dressed symbolized the plan for 
the battle ahead. 
●
●The tribe would chant and play drums, whistles, and rattles in the 
traditional ways they had been taught by their ancestors. Together, 
they would dance as they called upon their ancestors and Mother 
Earth for protection and strength, often through symbolism and 
offerings. The warriors would then go off to fight their battle.

Class 3 | The Resilient Human Spirit  |  23
●
●When some tribes, including the Lakota, were returning from war, 
they would paint their faces black, which symbolized victory. In many 
tribal cultures, the returning warriors would stay on the outskirts of 
the village for some time. Some tribes used fasting, sweat lodges for 
purification, and different ceremonies to release the war. When they 
returned to the village, wounds were dressed with plants and herbal 
remedies, often as a part of a ceremony. 
●
●Science is now showing that many of the techniques that the Native 
American tribes were using are in fact ways that the body integrates 
traumatic or stressful experiences. Hearing voice and sound modulation 
through chant and music, experiencing physical touch, repetitive 
movements such as rhythmic dance, and supportive community are 
all essential ways that people process adverse experiences and return 
to harmony.
Faith
●
●Faith plays a crucial role in infusing these ceremonies with life. 
Otherwise, they are just empty motions. Any mundane action can 
be made special when you infuse it with conscious intention. When 
many people think back to what has carried them through times of 
adversity, faith is often a part of it. 
●
●Faith in something is what sustains people through times of adversity. 
That can include faith in yourself, a partner, or a teacher. It can also 
include faith in love, faith things will get better, faith in a country or 
cause, faith in science, or faith in a higher power. Faith is what gets 
people out of bed in the morning to try again.
●
●Ultimately, what you have faith in is what you will see unfolding in 
your life in one way or another. That is because your actions will 
reflect where your faith resides. 
●
●Religions are a collection of values and beliefs that people follow, but 
even if one does not participate in a religion, everyone can have values 

24  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
and beliefs that they lean into as they move through life. Faith in these 
values is what gives the values life. 
●
●For instance, if a person does not have faith that he or she can 
accomplish something, it is likely the person won’t even try. However, 
with even the smallest seed of faith inside, then he or she will find the 
aspiration to get up and begin again. Without faith, no one would 
have traveled to space, set sail across an ocean, or fallen in love after 
their hearts had been broken.

would like to increase, such as your faith.

Class 4
The Consequences 
of Stress
T
he conditions of life change all the time. Stress is how the body responds 
to that change. Though stress is often thought of as a response to negative 
challenges, any time you adapt to change—such as starting a new job or 
hearing about a scary diagnosis from a loved one—your stress response activates, 
which keeps you motived and focused on what you need to do to adapt to the 
change. This class explores what stress is, what it does to the body and brain, 
how you can manage it, and how it can help or hurt your ability to be resilient. 
What Is Stress?
●
●Stress has several effects on the body. The peripheral nervous system 
is the network of nerves that sends and receives messages between 
the central nervous system—that is, the brain and spinal cord—and 
the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system is further broken 

26  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
down into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous 
system, both of which play a role when it comes to stress. 
●
●The somatic nervous system includes sensory neurons, which take 
information from the senses to the central nervous system, and motor 
neurons, which tell muscles how to move. The autonomic nervous 
system controls involuntary functions, like digestion and heartbeats. 
●
●The autonomic nervous system is further broken down into the 
sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. 
The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body to deal with stress. 
It speeds up the heart rate, dilates the pupils, and inhibits digestion, 
for example. The parasympathetic nervous system slows the body 
back down, and it is associated with rest and relaxation. 
Fight, Flight, or Freeze
A term that is commonly associated with the activation of the 
sympathetic nervous system is fight-or-flight. When startled—for 
instance, by a clap—your body initially reacts as if it is life-threatening 
until your higher brain kicks in and recognizes what is actually going 
on. Relatively recent scientific findings have pointed to a third option: 
freezing, creating a fight-flight-or-freeze trio. 
Causes of Stress
●
●Everyone experiences stress to some degree. Stress can be caused by 
financial obligations, social obligations, work, family, traffic, constant 
connection to the news, email and social media, and countless other 
demands. 
●
●There are two main types of stress: acute and chronic. Acute stress occurs 
when an unexpected change to your environment provokes a short-term 
stress response. Acute stress is what happens when you cram to finish 

Class 4 | The Consequences of Stress  |  27
a paper or work assignment, or when your dog bolts out of the house 
and you have to go find him. This can result in short-term symptoms 
like headaches, digestive issues, muscle 
tension, difficulty sleeping, and emotional 
distress. This kind of stress is more or less 
manageable, and it actually gives good 
opportunities to practice resilience. 
●
●Chronic stress, on the other hand, is 
often debilitating, and it can hinder your 
resilience when you don’t intervene. 
Chronic stress occurs when you feel 
constant pressure or worry. It happens 
when someone hates their job, is stuck 
in an unhealthy marriage, has unstable 
housing, or is constantly short on money. 
According to 
the American 
Psychological 
Association, nearly 25 
percent of Americans 
report experiencing 
regular high stress, 
and 50 percent report 
experiencing regular 
moderate stress.

28  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Sometimes, chronic stress happens as a result of trauma or other 
hardship from childhood, which leaves a lasting impact on the belief 
and nervous systems. When this happens, a person might experience 
hyperarousal and believe that no one can be trusted or that one 
shouldn’t ever make mistakes.
●
●Chronic stress can lead to an abundance of health problems. Over 
time, it lowers the amount of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, 
which can lead to depression. High blood pressure, stroke, and cancer 
are other health problems that can stem from stress. Perhaps one 
of the most dire consequences of chronic stress is that it can leave 
a person feeling disconnected from themselves and others, and this 
disconnection can contribute to suicide and violence. 
The Effects of Stress
●
●Stress changes the body and brain. For example, it changes the size of 
brain structures. Stress causes the amygdala, which is heavily involved 
in the experience of fear, to grow. Stress also causes the hippocampus, 
which enables people to form memories, to shrink. Stress also causes 
the prefrontal cortex, where people’s most advanced thinking and 
problem solving occurs, to go offline. This can make it harder to think 
through one’s actions and make decisions.
●
●Stress also makes people age faster. Research by Nobel Prize–winning 
biologist Elizabeth Blackburn has shown that the length of the 
telomeres has a direct correlation with the aging process. Telomeres 
are the protective structures at the end of chromosomes. The longer 
the telomeres, the slower the aging process. Stress shortens telomeres.
●
●Stress also tends to target weak spots. For example, if a person is prone 
to headaches, headaches become more likely during times of stress. 

Class 4 | The Consequences of Stress  |  29
Reactions to Stress 
●
●Stress can be a problem, but one’s reaction to the stress can also be part 
of the problem. For example, if you become stressed about stress, the 
experience will become compounded. However, if you take away your 
stressful reaction to stress, you can immediately start to ease a layer of 
the negative effects caused by the stress. 
●
●It also may help to change your perception of the stress. There are 
some situations where a certain amount of stress can keep you alert, 
motivated, and protected from outside threats. In these situations, 
you can view stress as something that may be helping you instead of 
hurting you. (This is not to say that you should stay in situations that 
are chronically stressful.)
Stress Management
Changing your relationship with stress is one tool that can help 
boost your ability to bounce back from life’s challenges. The rest 
of this class explores other aspects of stress management so that 
you can give yourself the support you need to move through stress 
without ignoring why it’s there and why you need it. 
The Relaxation Response
●
●When you are stressed, your sympathetic nervous system is activated, 
so to de-stress, you want to activate your parasympathetic nervous 
system. In other words, you want to relax. 
●
●When people are stressed, it is common to lean on consumables like 
wine or comfort food, but there is a much more effective way to relax: 
the relaxation response. The term relaxation response was originally 
coined by Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School. Evoking 
the relaxation response is characterized by a reduction in the rate of 
breathing, heart rate, and metabolism. 

30  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●The relaxation response shifts the body from the fight-or-flight 
sympathetic nervous system to the rest-and-digest parasympathetic 
nervous system. Sometimes this shift happens naturally, but you can 
also train your body to evoke the relaxation response. There are many 
ways to access the relaxation response, like breathing techniques, qi 
gong, tai chi, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, prayer, yoga, 
massage, and even activities like knitting.
Mind Training
●
●The emotional brain activates the stress response, which puts the 
logical brain, including the prefrontal cortex, in the background. 
With a stronger logical brain, you will have more control over your 
emotional brain, and therefore over your stress response. Yoga and 
meditation are two great tools for strengthening your logical brain. 
●
●Sometimes mind training also requires retraining your thought 
patterns. For example, if you believe the world is a threatening place, 
you will likely feel stress most of the time. 
●
●Psychotherapy and tools like iRest—a clinically adapted form of an 
ancient practice called Yoga Nidra—can be very effective in changing 
debilitating thought patterns. They create more access to positive 
thoughts and emotions, establishing feelings of safety, and accepting 
circumstances that are beyond your control. 
Boundary Setting
●
●A huge piece of stress management is simply knowing what to take on 
and when. If you’re working on a big project at work, it might be best 
not to take on an additional big project on top of that. Boundary setting 
also involves things like making sure you give yourself time for exercise, 
healthy food, and sleep—all of which are crucial for resilience. 

Class 4 | The Consequences of Stress  |  31
●
●Boundary setting involves recognizing the aspects of stress that you can 
control. When you start to feel stressed—and it is not helpful stress—or 
when you’re experiencing secondhand stress from others, try taking a 
moment to think about what is in your control. For example, if you 
start to recognize unhelpful feelings of stress while watching the news 
on TV, remember that you can always turn off the TV. 
Social Support
●
●Another component of responding well to stress is social support. 
Stress is an interpersonal phenomenon. People can contribute to your 
stress, and you can contribute to theirs. Stress can even be contagious: 
If someone in your environment is stressed, that person can cause you 
or others in your environment to feel stressed, too. 
●
●However, just as stress can be contagious, so can your ability to de-
stress. By actively working on managing your stress response and 

32  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
changing your relationship with stress, you can help those around you 
in a stressful situation rather than adding to all of the stress. 
●
●Additionally, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and because of that, 
support can be extremely beneficial in helping you bounce back from 
stress. There is always someone who can help in some form or another. 
●
●Oxytocin is known as the love hormone. However, oxytocin is 
released in times of stress. This is your body encouraging you to find 
support during times of need, and stress is certainly a time of need. 
The physical benefits of oxytocin, like relaxing your blood vessels, are 
amplified when you get support from others. You can thank your stress 
response both for preparing you to take action and for encouraging 
you to connect with others.

Mastering Physical 
Resilience
P
hysical resilience is the body’s ability to bounce back easily from physical 
stress, illness, or injury, which requires an extra set of skills above and 
beyond strength training and even physical fitness. This class looks at 
how you can build these skills. Keep in mind that physical resilience is both 
what you do and how you do it. 
Setting Goals
●
●Setting physical fitness goals is something 
many people have done before, only to 
burn out or let it trickle off. Rather than 
setting you up for idealistic physical 
resilience goals that may never be achieved, at which point you will 
feel like you’ve failed, this class recommends a different approach. 
The best exercise 
is the one that you 
actually do.

Class 5 | Mastering Physical Resilience  |  35
●
●A good starting point is setting out to do something every day. You 
can pick what it is and how long you do it, but you have to absolutely 
commit to doing it every day. It could be getting a Fitbit and making 
sure you walk 10,000 steps a day, or 5,000, or 2,000. It could be 
doing a half-hour of yoga, taking an aerobics class, or swimming. Pick 
something and then commit to it. 
●
●Perhaps you want to set a big, audacious goal, like completing a 
challenging triathlon. Even then, it is still important to create a plan 
that is made up of many small, obtainable goals along the way that 
will help you get to your ultimate goal.
●
●Whatever goal you pick, make sure it is compelling for you. For 
example, losing 20 pounds is not compelling. The reason you want to 
lose 20 pounds is compelling. 
Willpower 
●
●Many people who set physical fitness goals depend on their 
willpower alone to make it happen. There are some people who have 
a tremendous capacity to utilize willpower in achieving their goals, 
while others are not as capable. 
●
●There are ways to cultivate willpower, and there are also ways to create 
a backup plan for achieving your physical resilience goals, just in case 
your willpower fails on a given day. The secret method for boosting 
your willpower is to create a very strong connection with why you are 
doing something.
●
●The stronger your reasons for doing something are connected to 
your values, the more solid your willpower becomes. The more you 
reflect upon why you are doing something and feel connected to those 
reasons, the more likely you are to do it. 
●
●It is also helpful to pick an activity you genuinely love and then do 
that activity in places where you genuinely enjoy being. Even if it is 

36  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
not fun 100 percent of the time, physical activity should be fun at 
least a healthy percentage of the time. 
●
●You can also make physical activity a part of your lifestyle. For example, 
you might walk or bike to your destination instead of getting in the 
car, or take the stairs instead of an elevator. 
●
●Once you find an activity you like, find ways that you can make it 
even more fun. For instance, you might do the activity outdoors 
instead of inside. You can add music, bring friends along, or sign up 
for a charity race. You will be many times more likely to do something 
if you enjoy it rather than if it is drudgery. 
Choosing Your Exercise
●
●It is also essential to pick the type of physical exercise that is right for 
your body. Every human body comes into the world with different 

Class 5 | Mastering Physical Resilience  |  37
needs. People all have different constitutions, ages, tendencies, 
injuries, and strengths. 
●
●It helps to consult an expert like a doctor, physical therapist, or 
experienced personal trainer on what activities are best for you. If 
you haven’t worked out in some time or have a history of accidents or 
injury, go slow and build toward your goals. If you injure yourself the 
first week, you are far less likely to continue. Keep listening to your 
body and discovering what it needs.
●
●When you are selecting the type of training you would like to do, 
there are several key factors that experts recommend as the pillars of 
solid physical fitness. These include cardiovascular fitness, strength, 
flexibility, and balance training. 
Measuring Physical Resilience
●
●People have more ability now to measure physical resilience than 
ever before. One of the fastest and easiest ways to measure physical 
resilience is by studying your heart rate and your heart rate variability. 
●
●The heart rate measures the number of times your heart beats per 
minute. Studying your heart rate both at times of rest and activity can 
give a good indicator to your level of cardiovascular fitness. Check 
with your doctor to see what heart rate is optimal for rest and activity, 
and that honors your age, size, and weight.
●
●Heart rate variability, on the other hand, measures specific changes 
in time between your successive heartbeats. Heart rate variability is 
one of the best ways to measure the state of the autonomic nervous 
system. This is important because the autonomic nervous system is 
involved in all of the automatic physical functions that relate to how 
the body processes stress and recovers from it. This includes blood 
pressure, cardiovascular disease, blood sugar levels, and other factors. 

38  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Low heart rate variability shows that the heart is under stress while 
exerting. High heart rate variability is for the most part a good 
indicator that your body is able to tolerate stress or to bounce back 
quickly when it is stressed. In general, high heart rate variability 
measured during rest is more favorable to low heart rate variability. 
●
●Measuring heart rate variability easily requires a device. Fortunately, 
there are many on the market today. They are simple to use and easy 
to track with a smartphone. 
Rest and Sleep
●
●Another important factor in maintaining physical resilience is to 
know when to stop and rest. Check in with yourself on a regular basis 
to make sure what you are doing is still feeling good. Additionally, if 
you have an injury, give it time to heal to avoid reinjury. Remember 
to take time to relax after doing any physical activity. 
●
●Sleep is also one of the most important factors in maintaining physical 
resilience. The average adult needs eight hours of sleep per night. That 
is the amount of time it takes the body to rest and restore itself. When 
the body doesn’t get enough sleep, the person begins to physically, 
emotionally, and mentally deteriorate. Committing to healthy sleep 
patterns is one of the most important things you can do to boost your 
physical resilience.
Rhythms
Rhythms are important. They teach the body to know naturally when 
it’s time to go to sleep, when it’s time to become hungry, and when it’s 
time to wake up. For example, a person will probably be less likely to 
binge on food if he or she isn’t absolutely starving when dinner comes 
around. He or she will be likely to get a full night’s rest by sticking to a 
regular bedtime and wakeup time. 

Class 5 | Mastering Physical Resilience  |  39
Nutrition
●
●Nutrition is another essential point for building your physical 
endurance. The foods you eat can either strengthen your body’s 
resilience or create stress and illness in your body. 
●
●If you want your body to perform well, it needs to be properly 
nourished, which includes getting the right amount of protein, 
carbohydrates, fats and oils, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. 
Everyone is different; for instance, the optimal diet for a body 
builder and an elderly person trying to overcome cancer may be quite 
dissimilar. It’s important to stay tuned into what your body needs 
and always keep listening for what it’s asking for, acknowledging how 
these needs change all the time. 
●
●Integrating food as part of resilience can also include the process of 
preparing and eating the food. By cooking for yourself and people 
around you, you can become more aware of what you are putting 

40  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
in your body. It can also be a fun and meaningful way to build 
connection with people.
●
●You can also take steps to make obtaining proper nutrition easier on 
yourself. For example, you are more likely to eat well if there is good 
food in the fridge than if you have to order takeout every night. If 
you know you are going to have a busy week, prepare on Sunday by 
making a couple of dishes that you can heat up throughout the week. 
Monitoring Yourself over Time
●
●As you take the steps to maintain a healthy diet, don’t forget that a 
good doctor can give you a wealth of information about how your 
body is performing. Blood and urine tests are a great way to see if you 
are getting all the proper nourishment you need. It is a good idea to 
get tested at least once a year. 
●
●It is also possible to track certain biochemical markers using metabolic 
panels for potential disease or imbalances. Nutrition support is often 
used in cases where there are issues to bring the body back into a 
healthy state. 
●
●Many people have food allergies that they are unaware of. If you 
have any physical symptoms of headaches, inflammation, or digestive 
issues, it’s a good idea to get a food allergy test to see if what you are 
eating may be causing the problem. 
●
●Talk to a doctor, dietician, or health coach to learn more about what 
diet is best for you. Remember, the way you feel after eating a food is 
one of the best ways to measure if it is helping you or holding you back.
●
●Finally, disease prevention and early diagnosis is one of the most 
important ways to stay physically resilient. If you have not been to 
the doctor in the past year, call your health-care providers to schedule 
appointments. Early detection of all diseases and physical injuries is 
key to bouncing back as quickly and effectively as possible.

Class 6
Improving 
Emotional 
Resilience
T
his class starts by exploring what emotions are and their fundamental 
purpose. The class then turns to common ways people are socialized 
to handle emotions and how that socialization may hinder emotional 
resilience. Next, the class covers the benefits that come from feeling both 
positive and negative emotions. The class ends with some strategies for building 
emotional resilience. 
Foundations of Emotions
●
●Scientifically, emotions are neural impulses with a variety of features 
that prompt us to take some sort of action. A more relatable definition 
might be that emotions are individual responses to the situations 
that you experience. Depending on your emotional resilience, your 
emotions can either support you or hijack you. Either way, they can 
completely change the way you experience the world. 

Class 6 | Improving Emotional Resilience  |  43
●
●Emotions come in primary and secondary varieties. According to 
neuroscientist and author Antonio Damasio, primary emotions are 
innate and enable people to act quickly. Think of primary emotions 
as those that can be observed in an infant. Infants purely react to 
their environment and have not yet developed the capacity to have a 
controlled response to their automatic emotions. 
●
●Psychologists Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen identified six such 
emotions: sadness, happiness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise. New 
research, however, points to there being only four basic emotions: 
sadness, happiness, fear, and anger. Even further, some researchers and 
clinicians believe that there are only three basic emotions: sadness, 
happiness, and fear. 
●
●Anger is often referred to as a secondary emotion. Secondary emotions 
are what you feel after having your initial reaction to an experience. 
They come from your ability to have thoughts and opinions about 
your circumstances and your primary emotions.
●
●The fundamental purpose of emotions is twofold. The first purpose 
is to push you to take some sort of action or to learn from your 
experience, guiding how you choose to respond to similar situations 
in the future. The second purpose is to help you communicate and 
interact with others. 
Socialization
●
●Typically, people avoid things they consider to be bad and welcome 
things they consider to be good. This raises a question: Which emotions 
are bad? The answer is that there are not any bad emotions. People are 
socialized to believe that emotions are good and bad, but in reality, they 
are all good, because they all help people navigate experiences. 
●
●Many cultures seem to value happiness over honoring the full 
spectrum of life’s experiences. For example, you might make an effort 

44  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
to not cry in front of others, and you might smile and say, “I’m fine,” 
even when you’re going through something difficult.
●
●Two emotions that people tend to have the most difficult time 
honoring are fear and sadness. For example, when someone says not 
to cry to a sad person, the goal is usually to make the person feel 
better. However, this message likely instead sends the message crying 
is a sign of weakness and makes others uncomfortable. Being told 
you’re OK during times of distress invalidates the emotions you’re 
feeling while distressed. 
●
●Keep in mind that emotional regulation and resilience does not 
mean you suppress your emotions. Instead, it means listening to the 
messages they have to give. Try asking yourself questions like these, 
which can transform the experience: 
»» What is present?

Class 6 | Improving Emotional Resilience  |  45
»» What does that feel like in my body?
»» Is there an action this experience is calling me to take in the world?
Positive and Negative Emotions
●
●When emotions are studied, they are often called positive and negative 
emotions. Positive emotions are pleasant to feel, like happiness, and 
negative emotions are unpleasant to feel, like sadness. 
●
●Positive feelings, such as happiness and joy, predict increases in 
resilience and life satisfaction. According to Barbara Fredrickson’s 
broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, positive emotions 
encourage new thoughts and actions that help build internal resources, 
improve psychological flexibility, and create better relationships. 
●
●However, so-called negative emotions have some positive benefits of 
their own. Emotions like sadness and fear prepare the body to deal 
with real or perceived danger by sharpening the memory and helping 
focus, which can improve one’s ability to analyze and act in situations.
●
●Negative emotions do not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. 
Studies on resilience report that all people, no matter how resilient they 
are, tend to experience negative emotions with similar frequencies. The 
only difference between the two groups is that more resilient people 
experience more frequent or higher levels of positive emotions than people 
who are measurably less resilient. Positive emotions serve as a protection 
mechanism against the adversities of life, no matter how strong fear, 
sadness, and other negative emotions become. 
●
●Because positive emotions foster resilience and negative emotions 
do not detract from it, there is no reason to hide or suppress these 
emotions. In fact, it is better to address them and learn from their 
message than it is to keep them pressed down or let them control you. 

46  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Building Emotional Regulation
Emotional regulation means you are fully aware and in charge of 
your emotions. Sometimes being in charge of emotions is defined 
as not showing emotions, but this is far from the truth. The more 
you suppress your emotions, the more they’re bound to burst out, 
either as anger or in their original form. The remainder of this class 
covers three components of emotional regulation that can help 
you improve your resilience: naming feelings, coping skills, and 
mindfulness. 
Naming Feelings
●
●In the book The Whole-Brain Child, Dan Siegel and Tina Payne 
Bryson offer brain-based parenting strategies. Many of the strategies 
for emotional regulation and resilience are geared toward children, 
but adults can benefit from these exact same skills. 
●
●One of the first ideas in The Whole-Brain Child is that in order to 
control your emotions, you need to know what it is you’re trying 
to control in the first place. The more you practice naming your 
emotions, both during emotional moments and after, the better you 
will be able to regulate your emotional experiences. 
●
●There are tools designed to help with this. For instance, the feeling 
wheel is a tool developed by Dr. Gloria Wilcox to help people name 
what they are feeling and find the root emotion behind it. You can 
simply use the wheel to help you name the various emotions you’re 
feeling, or you can use it to trace those emotions back to the center of 
the circle to help you simplify your emotional experience by bringing 
it back to a more basic emotion. 
●
●Another way to practice naming feelings is to dig into feelings of 
anger. Anger is often a secondary emotion that is covering up feelings 

Class 6 | Improving Emotional Resilience  |  47
of sadness or fear. Think about a time you’ve felt angry in the past or 
something you are feeling angry about in the present. 
●
●Look beneath the surface: You might actually be experiencing feelings 
of sadness or fear that are being masked by anger. For instance, if you 
yell at your partner for being late, it is possible that your emotion 
came from a fear that something happened to your partner.
Coping Skills
●
●When people struggle with emotions, it can lead them to engage in 
behaviors that harm themselves or others. Managing emotions can be 
hard, especially when it is a new skill. This is why coping skills are so 
crucial to developing emotional regulation. 
●
●One simple but very effective coping skill is to normalize the 
experience of having emotions. No matter what you’re feeling, tell 

48  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
yourself, “It’s OK that I feel this way.” Emotions are always OK; it is 
the behaviors that follow the emotions that are sometimes a problem. 
●
●Another quick and easy coping skill is to take three deep breaths when 
you’re feeling overwhelmed. Doing this has the potential to quickly 
lower your heart rate, which will encourage relaxation and feelings 
of calm. 
●
●Other options for coping skills 
include going for a walk, taking 
a yoga class, writing, dancing, 
cleaning, painting, and so on. 
These coping mechanisms involve 
some sort of physical outlet, either 
through gross motor movements or fine motor movements. Learning 
to observe where you feel your emotions in your body and giving 
them an outlet deepens your mind-body connection, which increases 
your emotional regulation and resilience. 
Practicing Mindfulness
●
●The ability to be mindful is one and the same with your ability to 
be emotionally resilient. Mindfulness is the ability to observe and 
experience emotions in the present moment without judgment. 
●
●Think about how many sensations there are for you to observe around 
you all the time. There are thousands. Take wherever you are right 
now: Perhaps you can notice the weight of your shirt on your shoulders 
or a sensation of coolness on your forehead. There are so many ways 
to practice mindfulness that Class 10 and Class 21 (a practice class) 
are dedicated to the concept. These will give you basic strategies for 
applying mindfulness to your own life.  
Make sure your coping 
skills are healthy, 
meaning they don’t hurt 
you or someone else.

Class 7
Strengthening 
Mental Resilience
T
his class will take you through the components of mental resilience. It 
starts by looking into thoughts, belief systems, and the role that core 
values play in mental resilience. Then the class dives into psychological 
flexibility—the foundation of mental resilience. The class compares rigid and 
flexible thinking styles, and then it discusses the impact your mindset can have 
on your psychological flexibility. The class concludes with some practical ways 
to boost your mental resilience. 
Thoughts and Belief Systems
●
●Like emotions, thoughts are neural impulses that prompt people to 
take short-term action or work toward long-term goals. The thoughts 
a person has are a combination of his or her circumstances, life 
experiences, upbringing, social environment, mood, physical needs, 
and so on. 

Class 7 | Strengthening Mental Resilience  |  51
●
●Your belief system, meanwhile, affects everything that you see, for 
better or for worse. For example, it can be the difference between 
feeling sympathy or derision toward a homeless person on the street. 
●
●The brain naturally tries to mold incoming information so that it fits 
within a person’s belief system. Thoughts are the building blocks of 
your belief system, and the quality of these thoughts can have a huge 
impact on your resilience. This makes it important to put time toward 
considering your thinking. 
●
●Keep in mind that trying to stop yourself from thinking simply doesn’t 
work. However, humans have a well-developed prefrontal cortex, 
which is the part of the brain that helps with complex thinking and 
decision making. Even though you might not be able to control all of 
your thoughts, you can use your prefrontal cortex to help control how 
you react to your thoughts. 

52  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Core Values
●
●The first step in building strong mental resilience is making sure that 
an internal compass, which directs you toward what you find most 
meaningful, guides your life. Core values are the building blocks for 
a life with meaning. 
●
●The most basic level of control you can have over your belief system 
is uncovering your true core values and living them in your everyday 
life. If your core values have meaning, it will be much easier to follow 
them, especially when times get hard. 
●
●Think about your core values. Do you know where they come from? 
Were they passed down to you, or did you find them on your own? Do 
any of your core values contradict each other? Do you live your core 
values in practice? It doesn’t matter how you find your core values, so 
long as they feel right and are meaningful to you. 
●
●Take some time to define your core values, focusing not on what 
sounds good, but on what is most meaningful to you and why. 
Everyone grows and changes, and part of resilience is the ability to 
adapt to changing circumstances, so keep in mind that your core 
values may adapt with time, too. What you find meaningful might 
change, but your core values will remain meaningful, no matter what 
that looks like for you. 
Rigid and Flexible Thinking
●
●A primary cause of problems is when one’s expectations don’t meet 
one’s reality. When a person’s thinking is rigid, he or she can become 
stuck, holding on tightly to absolute beliefs about themselves, others, 
and the world, often in spite of evidence pointing against these beliefs. 
The focus of life shifts from goals and values to the avoidance of 
discomfort and pain.

Class 7 | Strengthening Mental Resilience  |  53
●
●Flexible thinking, on the other hand, can allow you to adapt your 
thinking so that it fits with changing circumstances, which enables 
you to continue to move toward your goals in spite of challenges. 
Psychological flexibility helps people see options in how they look at 
and respond to circumstances. 
●
●Rigid thinking is not to be confused with discipline and 
determination. Sticking to goals and core values motivates discipline 
and determination. Rigid thinking gives a false sense of control over 
situations that are often out of your control. 
●
●Pay attention to your reaction when your thinking is challenged or 
questioned by others. If your reaction is to get defensive or indignant, 
there is a good chance that rigid thinking is at play. 
Growth Mindset versus Fixed Mindset
●
●A large piece of your belief system that also impacts your psychological 
flexibility is how you view failure, which, according to Stanford 
professor Carol Dweck, is embedded in your mindset. Dweck 
distinguishes between two types of mindset: a growth mindset and a 
fixed mindset. 
●
●When a person has a fixed mindset, the person believes his or her 
abilities and intelligence are unchanging. A person with a growth 
mindset believes his or her abilities and intelligence can develop. 
●
●With a fixed mindset, success is determined by an outcome, such 
as scoring well on a test or securing a coveted job. With a growth 
mindset, success is determined by the process—for example, the 
things one learned by studying for a test or the skills acquired in the 
job search, regardless of the outcome. 
●
●If you’re motivated by the process, your determination persists in 
spite of perceived failure. There is value in the failure. If you’re only 

54  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
motivated by the outcome, you may become discouraged by frequent 
perceived failure and perceive yourself as inherently flawed.
Improving Mental Resilience
The rest of this class discusses two main strategies for improving 
your mental resilience. The first and most important strategy is 
learning how to accept your thoughts. Once this has been mastered, 
it becomes easier to venture into the second strategy: challenging 
your thoughts. 
Accepting Your Thoughts
●
●You can’t always change your circumstances, but you can change your 
relationship with your circumstances. The key to this is changing your 
relationship with your thoughts. In order to do this, it’s so important 
to recognize that thoughts are not facts. By recognizing your thoughts 
as thoughts rather than fact, you can start to detach from them, which 
increases your psychological flexibility and resilience. 
●
●For example, if someone had the thought, “I am a failure,” she could 
change her relationship to the sentiment by thinking instead, “I had 
a thought that I am a failure.” This small shift changes the perceived 
truth of this thought from the person being a failure to the person 
having a thought that they were a failure. 
●
●Recognizing thoughts as thoughts rather than facts makes it easier to 
welcome every part of your experience. Welcoming thoughts enhances 
your psychological flexibility, since you are not ignoring or avoiding 
any part of your experience. Suppressing thoughts or clinging to a 
thought out of fear of its opposite keeps thinking rigid. 

Class 7 | Strengthening Mental Resilience  |  55
Challenging Your Thoughts
●
●Once you have mastered welcoming your thoughts, rather than 
ignoring or avoiding them, it allows you to look at your thoughts 
more objectively. This makes it easier to transform your thoughts in a 
way that can better serve you, your values, and your goals. 
●
●Unhelpful thoughts are thoughts that keep thinking rigid and prevent 
you from being able to work toward your goals. Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy, or CBT, is one of the most widely used therapy orientations 
that focuses on helping people challenge their unhelpful thinking 
patterns and go-to behaviors. 
●
●One example of an unhelpful thought is worst-case-scenario thinking. 
This is when your head tends to jump to the worst possible outcome 
instead of thinking about more likely outcomes. 
●
●Another example is the use of the word should, as in, “I should’ve known 
better.” The use of should can show judgment of yourself or others, can 

56  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
discourage you, or can show you when you might be holding yourself 
to outside standards that don’t resonate with your truth. 
●
●Here is the same thought without the word should: “I want to do 
better next time.” Removing should removes judgment and shame, 
and replaces them with options for the future.
Shifting Your Perspective
●
●After learning to welcome your thoughts, you can practice shifting 
your focus and broadening your perspective. If you tend to put most 
of your energy toward focusing on what could go wrong, try thinking 
instead of what could go right. 
●
●Shifting your perspective can change how you see the world around 
you. It can change whether you look at the world as containing good 
people and bad people or as containing good people who make good 
and not good choices. 
●
●Making changes to your belief system can change not only how you 
view others, but how you view yourself, too. For example, think about 
your self-talk. Do you tend to be nice to yourself or critical of yourself? 
●
●If you notice yourself being self-critical, one thought-shifting exercise 
you can try is creating a personal gratitude list. Spend time reflecting 
on everything about yourself that you like and that you’re grateful for, 
such as physical abilities, personality traits, interests, and so on. 
●
●To challenge thoughts, it can also help to shift your perception of thinking 
as a whole. If you tend to avoid certain thoughts or emotions, try to 
change your experience of them by generating curiosity about them. 
●
●For example, if you are nervous before a presentation and worry that 
the nervousness will hurt your performance, try shifting how you see 
your nervousness. Instead of a detriment, you might view it as a rare life 
experience that shows how alive and present you are in that moment.

Class 8
The Practice 
of Self-Care
N
ot taking care of yourself can result in problems with sleep, difficulties 
with concentration, damage to your mood, and other problems, so 
self-care is essential. This class starts by looking at basic principles of 
self-care. It also looks at the impact that self-worth has on self-care. The class 
ends with some tools you can use to create a self-care plan.
Basic Principles of Self-Care
●
●The concept of self-care is not new, but for many people, actually 
putting it into practice is new. A good self-care routine is like a good set 
of armor, allowing you to endure the challenges of life with greater ease. 
●
●The first core principle is balance, which is not an end state. It is an 
ongoing, constantly changing process. Balance is making sure that, 
day by day, aspects of your life aren’t being neglected. For example, if 

Class 8 | The Practice of Self-Care  |  59
you find yourself having fits of anger, it’s a message that something is 
out of balance. Perhaps your emotional needs aren’t being met. 
●
●The second core principle of a self-care plan involves setting 
boundaries. The foundation of setting boundaries is knowing when 
to say no to other people and to yourself. Boundaries often come into 
play in careers: A person who constantly works 60-hour weeks, checks 
email around the clock, and puts everyone’s needs above her own may 
need to set better boundaries.
●
●The third principle is that a good self-care plan should keep your 
energy reserves full. A lack of balance and boundaries can drain your 
energy reserves, so looking at self-care in terms of energy reserves 
is the simplest way to make sure you are giving yourself the care 
you deserve.
Self-Worth and Self-Efficacy
●
●A huge piece of self-care and your ability to be resilient is simply being 
nice to yourself, valuing yourself, and believing in your importance to 
the world. Your self-worth can be seen in your behaviors, self-talk, and 
interactions with others. 
●
●The only way to accurately uncover your sense of self-worth is through 
deep, honest, self-reflection. Think about how you talk to yourself. 
Are you harsh and self-critical? Would you ever talk to a friend the 
way you talk to yourself? Do you build yourself up by tearing others 
down? These can speak to a lack of self-worth. 
●
●The companion to self-worth is self-efficacy, or your belief that you 
can accomplish something. It is very common for self-worth to affect 
self-efficacy. If you don’t think highly of yourself, you might not be 
confident in your abilities. It is possible, though, to have a high sense 
of self-efficacy while also having low self-worth. 

60  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Research on both self-worth and self-efficacy shows that these qualities 
improve one’s ability to cope with and bounce back from difficult 
circumstances. This can be seen in action by looking at the concept of 
codependency: If your sense of self-worth is dependent on something 
external, it goes down or away when that person or object is absent or 
disengaged from you. 
●
●For instance, if a dating prospect decides they do not want to be with 
you, you might internalize that as a belief that you are not good enough. 
However, if you recognize your self-worth, you can understand that 
someone not wanting a life with you does not take away from your 
value as a person. This in turn can improve your self-efficacy—the 
belief that you can navigate your personal life successfully, in spite 
of challenges.
Self-Compassion and Self-Worth
●
●Cultivating self-compassion can help work through deep feelings of 
shame that may seep through in actions that hurt yourself and others. 
Self-compassion fuels self-worth, and when you recognize your worth, 
you will naturally be more inclined to take care of yourself. 
●
●Keep in mind that building self-compassion is a process: Creating 
habits and rewiring thought patterns doesn’t happen overnight. Even 
if your reaction is to be frustrated that it is hard to show yourself 
compassion, try to have compassion for that. 
Sometimes working through shame and building your sense of 
self-worth is best accomplished by a professional trained in helping 
people work through these emotions. 

Class 8 | The Practice of Self-Care  |  61
Self-Care Tool: The Wheel of Life
●
●The Wheel of Life is a helpful tool that will allow you to evaluate how 
well you take care of yourself. The purpose of the wheel is to measure 
and map out how you feel you are doing in each category of life. You 
can use the wheel included on the next page or create your own by 
following these steps:
1.	 Draw a circle and create spokes on the wheel. You can make as 
many spokes on the wheel as you find helpful. 
2.	 Divide the wheel into different categories of life. It is recommended 
that you pick between 6 and 12 categories. Each category has its 
own spoke of the wheel. You can use these example of categories, 
choose your own, or both:
»» Family Life
»» Career
»» Social Life
»» Personal Development
»» Health
»» Finances
»» Free Time
»» Romantic Relationships
»» Life Purpose
»» Religion/Spirituality
»» General Housekeeping
»» Giving Back
3.	 Each spoke starts at 0 at the center of the wheel and ends at 10 at 
the outermost part of the wheel. To complete the wheel, place a 
dot on each section of the wheel somewhere on the line between 
0 and 10. A score of 0 in a category means you have a lot of room 
for improvement in that category, whereas a score of 10 means you 
are already living at your fullest in that category. 

62  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●As you add dots to your wheel, you’ll start to see that you’re thriving in 
some aspects of your life, whereas you feel more constricted in other 
aspects. Once you’re done placing a dot in each category, connect the 
dots. Ideally, you’ll see a round wheel, but it is more likely that your 
wheel will look somewhat bumpy. 
●
●A bumpy wheel lets you know that your life is asking for more balance. 
Often, the key to that balance is in your self-care practice. 
●
●The end goal isn’t a round wheel that is all 10s. Rather, it is to simply 
have a round wheel, hopefully in the higher range of numbers. For 
instance, if your career is a 10 but your family life is a 5, you might 
The Wheel of Life

Class 8 | The Practice of Self-Care  |  63
realize that boosting your family score requires pulling back from your 
career score. A good goal might be striving for an 8 in both categories.
Self-Care Tool: The Needs Wheel
●
●Another tool you can use is a wheel divided not by category of life 
but by category of need. You can use the blank Needs Wheel below or 
create your own. To create your own, draw a circle, just as you did for 
the Wheel of Life. Then, create 5 to 10 spokes on your wheel.
●
●Feel free to label the spokes with whatever needs are pertinent to you. 
For example, the sample Needs Wheel below covers physical needs, 
Physical
Needs
Emotional
Needs
Mental
Needs
Overall
Relational
Needs
Spiritual
Needs
The Needs Wheel

64  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
emotional needs, mental needs, overall relational needs, and spiritual 
needs. It also has five blank spokes for any other needs you want to add.
●
●Keep in mind that if you feel an obligation to do something, it loses 
some of its value in nourishing you. If exercising, attending a service, 
meditating, or conducting volunteer work is seen as a line item on 
a checklist, it is unlikely that it is actually meeting your need for 
purpose or meaning. Find something that truly serves you when you 
look to fulfill your needs. 
Self-Care Tool: Journal
●
●A journal is another tool you can use to evaluate how well you’re 
doing with self-care. One method is to create a grid in a spreadsheet 
and then print out 52 copies of it on the first day of the year. On the 
next page is a blank example: 
●
●To create your own, down the left side of the grid, write the different 
activities that you spend your time doing, including working, sleeping, 
family time, and exercise. The grid can also include fields like the 
quality of your diet and meditation practice. 
●
●In the column next to your activities, put your ideal goal in each 
applicable category so that you have a point to measure against. For 
example, one ideal might be to sleep eight hours per night. Another 
might be a certain number of minutes of meditation. Place seven 
blank rows for each day of the week next to each ideal. 
●
●From here, you can track how you do each week. For more examples 
of activities and measures with which to track them, refer to the audio 
or video class.

Conclusion
●
●Every person’s self-care plan will look different. Your plan may include 
daily activities, such as time for deep breathing and self-reflection. It 
may also include weekly or monthly activities, such as a massage or a 
retreat in nature. It could also include reminders to simply let yourself 
feel your feelings or to set time aside each day to write three kind 
things about yourself.
●
●Self-care creates the foundation for your resilience by keeping your 
tank full and ready to go. Tracking and reflecting on self-care can 
bring your attention to a few simple changes that can bring more 
balance and freedom to your life, improving your overall resilience.

The Rewards 
of Sleep
H
aving healthy sleep patterns can transform your life. There is significant 
evidence that sleeping can help you live longer, improve your memory, 
decrease anxiety and depression, improve physical and mental health, 
and promote safety. All of these can help boost your resilience. This class looks 
at what happens to the body during sleep and ways you can improve your sleep.
The Body during Sleep
●
●When you sleep, you move through several distinct sleep stages. Stage 
1 is the process of beginning to fall asleep where your muscles start 
to relax, your eyes may have a difficult time staying open, and the 
world around you starts to disappear. Stage 2 is a light, dreamless sleep 
where the body is settling into rest. You may still be able to wake up 
easily from this stage of sleep. 

Class 9 | The Rewards of Sleep  |  69
●
●Stages 3 and 4 are when slow-wave sleep starts to kick in and the body 
gets to rest. Brain and muscle activity significantly decreases. These 
are the stages where you truly replenish your physical and mental 
energy reserves. 
●
●Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is another stage that occurs 
throughout the night. The REM phase is the one most closely 
associated with dreaming. The mind becomes extremely active, 
but the muscles and body are in a state of paralysis. Some describe 
REM sleep as a “rinse” of the brain, where it clears away toxins and 
byproducts that have accumulated throughout the day. 
●
●People move through these stages four or five times throughout the 
course of a healthy night’s rest. If you do not receive seven to eight 
hours of sleep, the body doesn’t have the opportunity to move through 
these cycles several times. Additionally, sleep interruptions inhibit the 
ability to move cleanly through these sleep cycles.

70  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Preparing for Sleep
Just as you prepare yourself for a workout, you can also prepare 
yourself for sleep so that you get the most out of it. The following are 
several tips for sleep preparation.
Creating the Right Bedroom
●
●Take a look at your bedroom and ask yourself if everything in there 
helps you feel peaceful, nurtured, comfortable, and at ease. If not, 
remove it. Try to make sure that everything in the room is something 
uplifting and that it’s free from clutter. 
●
●Instead of the stack of books next to your bed, just keep the one you 
are reading. Instead of piling your clothes on a chair in the corner, try 
putting them in the laundry or hanging them up. Choose soft lighting 
or candles before sleep rather than bright overhead lights. 
●
●Prepare the ambiance of the room by making sure you have blinds 
or blackout shades to keep light out of the room. Make sure the 
temperature is right for sleep: The room being too hot or too cold can 
affect your body’s ability to relax throughout the night. 
●
●You may also want to invest in a new mattress. It’s crucial to find a 
mattress that it is right for your body. Then, top it off with sheets, 
blankets, and pillows that make you feel comfortable. 
●
●Some people who have trouble sleeping find that weighted blankets 
are helpful to them. It can help the body feel more protected and 
secure, much like swaddling a baby. It’s also important to keep animals 
off the bed if they disturb your sleep. 

Class 9 | The Rewards of Sleep  |  71
Televisions and Phones
●
●Many people have televisions in their bedrooms; however, televisions 
are highly stimulating to the brain, which can disturb it before sleep. 
If you watch television, try to do it earlier in the day or evening and 
set limits on it. Nearly every television comes with a timer. Set limits 
for yourself and try to stick to them. 
●
●It is also a good idea to put your cell phone in another room of your 
house while you sleep and to put the phone on silent mode, so as 
to not be disturbed by notifications. Taking the phone into your 
bedroom also can rob you of extra sleep, as many people end up 
reading the news, surfing social media, or playing games. 
●
●Instead of using the alarm clock on your phone, buy an old-fashioned 
alarm and use that to wake you up instead of your phone. If you want 
to use your smartphone for something useful related to sleep, most 
smartphones come with sleep timers that will remind you when to 
go to sleep. 
Exercise, Water, Caffeine, and Alcohol
●
●If you find that you have trouble sleeping, you may want to increase 
the amount of exercise you do during the day. It’s important to get 
some sort of physical movement or exercise every day. 
●
●If you have trouble sleeping, also look at how much caffeine, sugar, 
or other stimulants you are consuming.  For example, caffeine is a 
double-edged sword: People turn to it when they don’t feel rested, 
and then it perpetuates the cycle of their bodies not being able to rest. 
Try not to drink any caffeinated beverages after 12:00 pm if you have 
trouble sleeping at night. 
●
●Be sure to drink plenty of water during the day. People often feel 
fatigued when their bodies are dehydrated. Many people turn to 
caffeine during these moments, when they may instead need water. 

72  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
However, try not to drink too many liquids after dinner, as these can 
lead to having to go to the bathroom frequently throughout the night.
●
●Many people turn to alcohol to help them fall asleep. The problem is 
that alcohol also causes the body to wake up in the middle of the night. 
It both disrupts sleep and diminishes sleep quality. Additionally, it is 
a diuretic, which can wake you up for multiple trips to the bathroom 
when you should be sleeping. 
Preparing the Body and Mind for Sleep
●
●It is much better for the body to use natural ways to fall and stay 
asleep, and there are ways you can prepare your body for sleep. If 
you are someone who tends to harbor tension in your body, you may 
want to start by doing some gentle stretches, tension and relaxation 
exercises, or breathing exercises that evoke the relaxation response. 
●
●Just as it is a good idea to avoid looking at television or checking the 
news before bed, it is also a good idea to calm down the mind before 
sleep. Read something relaxing or inspiring instead of something that 
can disturb the mind. Additionally, try to have uplifting conversations 
or interactions instead of going into a sticky emotional issue that may 
cause agitation before sleep. 
●
●Avoid checking work email or messages before sleep, which can get 
the wheels of the mind turning. You’ll be more effective at whatever 
you have to do the next day when your body and mind have had 
enough time to rest and restore. 
●
●Another practice that can help calm down the mind before bed is 
to do a day’s review. Every night before going to sleep, mentally go 
through your day and think about what went well. Think about why 
those actions felt so good to you and how perhaps you helped other 
people or made a positive difference. 

Class 9 | The Rewards of Sleep  |  73
●
●If there are memories from the day that you don’t feel good about, 
bring those to mind. Think about how you would do them differently 
next time or something good that may come from those actions 
eventually. This will help create positive thought patterns and can 
help to clean up any lingering issues in the brain. 
Yoga Nidra
Yoga Nidra guided meditation may be able to help you sleep more 
deeply. It is also an excellent tool for napping. Some initial research 
has found that 20 minutes of Yoga Nidra is equal to approximately 
two hours of sleep in terms of how the brain restores itself. 
●
●Taking a bath before bedtime can be yet another nurturing way to 
calm down the body and mind before bedtime. The hot water elevates 
the body temperature, but when you get out, the flash of cooler air 
causes the body to naturally start producing melatonin. Adding 
Epsom salts to your bath can amp up the healing properties. 

74  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●It is best to avoid eating two hours before going to sleep to give 
your body a chance to properly digest. If you are going to snack pre-
bedtime, choose foods that are high in B vitamins, magnesium, and 
protein. Try to avoid high-calorie foods at this time. 
●
●Reliability is an important trait to have when cultivating a sleep 
routine. The human body loves rhythms and patterns. If you promise 
yourself you are going to get eight hours of sleep, follow through every 
night. If you have a late event, plan to start your morning later the 
next day so that you can get a full eight hours. 
●
●The best practice is to set a time that you are going to go to sleep 
every night so that your body naturally starts producing melatonin 
and serotonin.  Find your body’s natural biorhythm—that is, when 
your body prefers to fall asleep and then to wake up when it is fully 
rested. You will know you have succeeded at this when you no longer 
need an alarm clock. Invest in finding the pattern that is right for you. 
Your body and mind will thank you.

Finding Equanimity 
with Mindfulness
T
his class explores how mindfulness and meditation can contribute to 
your physical and emotional resilience. All forms of mindfulness and 
meditation are designed to help you have a direct experience of stillness 
so that you can live from a place of peacefulness. There are many pathways to 
the same destination, and this class covers several of them. 
Meditation as a Tool
●
●Meditation is a practical and simple tool that you can use to train 
your mind to be more focused, healthier, and happier. Meditation is 
scientifically validated now by thousands of clinical studies. 
●
●However, meditation is not about escaping your reality. It is about 
being present with what is so that you can move through it effectively. 

Class 10 | Finding Equanimity with Mindfulness  |  77
You do not have to make your thoughts stop to meditate, and you do 
not have to spend hours a day meditating. 
Concentration-Based Meditation
●
●There are many forms of meditation, but they mostly fall into two 
main categories: concentration-based meditation and mindfulness 
meditation. Concentration-based meditation involves sitting quietly 
and picking a point of focus for the mind to rest upon. 
●
●Typically in the Eastern traditions, a mantra or syllable was used to 
help focus the mind. You can also pick a point of focus like a flower, 
stone, or sound. Once the mind becomes focused on the mantra or 
Although many religions 
do use meditation as 
a part of their practice, 
meditation is not a 
religious practice. 
Meditation can be an 
entirely secular activity. 

78  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
object, the thoughts begin to slow down, and the mind is then able 
to settle into deeper states of stillness. During practice, you may find 
that your mind is particularly distracted in the beginning, but then it 
starts to calm down as you repeat the word or mantra.
●
●Concentration-based practices root back to the Hindu and Buddhist 
traditions that use mantras, such as om, om namah shivaya, and om 
mani padme hūm, as a point of focus during the meditation. You can 
use these traditional mantras, or you can use a phrase or affirmation 
that will help your mind to focus. One example is the phrase, “I am 
happy, healthy, and peaceful, just as I am.” You can also pick a word 
such as love or courage to repeat to yourself. If you have a particular 
religious prayer or mantra that works for you from your religious 
tradition, you can use this as well. 
●
●If you are deeply connected to nature, you can choose to focus on 
a flower, stone, or tree. Some people enjoy focusing on the flame 
of a candle. As the mind begins to calm down, you can release the 
mantra and just let the mind rest in stillness. If the mind begins to 
get distracted again by various thoughts, you can begin again with 
the mantra. 
Mindfulness Meditation
●
●The second type of meditation is mindfulness meditation. At its core, 
mindfulness is the ability to pay attention on purpose. It involves 
observing your experience in the present moment without judgment, 
and it can be practiced at any moment in your life. The more it is 
practiced, the more it becomes a natural way of life. The more 
natural it becomes, the more helpful mindfulness can be in building 
your resilience. 

Class 10 | Finding Equanimity with Mindfulness  |  79
A Brief History of Mindfulness
One of the pioneers in introducing mindfulness to the medical field 
is Jon Kabat-Zinn, who developed a treatment program known as 
mindfulness-based stress reduction, or MBSR. In 1992, researchers 
Zindel Segal, Mark Williams, and John Teasdale sought to create a 
group that utilized dialectical behavior therapy, acceptance therapy, 
and commitment therapy, but during the development process, they 
participated in an MBSR session. They were amazed by the experience. 

Instead of their original idea, the trio created mindfulness-based 
cognitive therapy, which became one of the first integrations of 
mindfulness and traditional cognitive therapy to be used in the 
mental health field. Some other common and well-known mental 
health treatment orientations that use the power of mindfulness are 
dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance commitment therapy. 

Another application is Integrative Restoration, or iRest Yoga Nidra, 
which uses mindfulness to promote healing, relaxation, and resilience. 
Richard Miller, a clinical psychologist, author, researcher, and yogic 
scholar, adapted traditional Yoga Nidra, which has been around for 
over 2,000 years, into the secular practice of iRest. 
●
●Mindfulness practices are not about fixing what you are experiencing. 
You witness it, observe it, and allow it to tell its story. The moment 
you begin trying to fix and change yourself, tension and stress begin 
to arise.  
●
●This is the essence of resilience. It is essential to learn to keep your 
peace amidst whatever happens in life rather than letting it be 
dependent on outward conditions. That does not, however, mean that 

80  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
you don’t work to affect change in your life. It just means that your 
peace of mind is not dependent upon it.
How to Be Mindful
●
●When you’re awake, most of your time is spent doing things, such as 
work and caring for your family. When doing a task, you might not 
be fully present in what you are doing. For instance, you might be 
thinking of something else while completing the task at hand.
●
●The first piece of mindfulness is reminding yourself that people are 
not called human doings; they are human beings. The word being 
implies being present in the moment. But when people are overtly 
attached to the end goal, they often lose the ability to be fully present 
in the moment. 
●
●Instead, people form attachments to some point on the horizon that 
may or may not ever come. It is important to value how you do things 

Class 10 | Finding Equanimity with Mindfulness  |  81
just as much as the end state of what you are doing. Ideally, if you are 
fully present in the moment as you are doing something, you will be 
even more efficient and effective in achieving your goals. Additionally, 
you will arrive there with a present and peaceful state of mind rather 
than a stressed-out sense of urgency. 
●
●It is likely that your attention is constantly being grabbed by different 
stimuli, such as someone calling your name, a loud noise outside, or 
a notification on your phone. To practice mindfulness, try bringing 
your attention to things that aren’t screaming for your attention. 
●
●Orient yourself to your entire surrounding, and try using all of your 
senses. Pay attention to the sensation of your clothes on your body or 
note every sound in your surroundings. You might also try pointing 
out five things that are a certain color around you, four tactile 
sensations you have, three things you can hear, two things you can 
smell, and one thing you can taste. 
Connecting to Your Body
●
●Once passively observing your surroundings becomes easier, it will 
become easier to learn how to passively observe uncomfortable 
emotions and thoughts as well. Much of your ability to do this comes 
from your ability to connect with your physical body. 
●
●Your body constantly gives you information about how you’re feeling 
and what you’re doing. For example, you might hold stress in your 
shoulders. Such sensations are messages that you need to listen to. 
Mind-body practices like yoga and qigong can help you improve 
your connection to your own body so that you can learn to feel and 
interpret these messages. 
●
●Co-meditation is another tool that can be used to practice connecting 
with what is happening in your body while, at the same time, being 
present for another person as well. It is a partner practice that is easy 

82  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
to do and takes a surprisingly short amount of time to bring you fully 
into the present moment. 
●
●Sit with a trusted friend, family member, or your partner and take 
turns sharing what sensations you each feel in your body. Both 
participants can either keep their eyes opened or closed, whichever is 
most comfortable for them. 
●
●Set a timer for two minutes. For the first two minutes, one person shares 
and the other person listens. Once the timer goes off, you switch, and 
the other person shares for two minutes while the person who shared 
first listens. Each two minutes, switch from person to person. 
●
●During the successive two-minute increments, participants share 
answers to these questions without being asked: What is present? 
Where do I feel what is present in my body? For instance, one person 
might share, “I feel tension in my stomach and an sense of uneasiness 
about a conversation I had this morning.” 
●
●Parts of the practice may be done in silence as the person feels into 
what is present. The person sharing may speak for the entire two 
minutes about one thing that is present. Alternatively, the person may 
spend some portions of the time in silence observing what is present, 
and then sharing the same experience or a new one.
●
●You can alternate back and forth as many times as you would like 
in two-minute increments. Keep in mind that you don’t have to 
comment on what the other person shares. It may naturally become 
a part of your experience, but it isn’t a conversation. It is a practice of 
deep listening. 
Practicing Mindfulness in Everyday Life
●
●Mindfulness can truly be practiced anytime and anywhere. Even 
taking a five-second break to take some deep breaths and check in 

Class 10 | Finding Equanimity with Mindfulness  |  83
with your body sensations, emotions, and thoughts can give you the 
resilience-building benefits of mindfulness. 
●
●Some of the best times to practice being mindful come during your 
rote daily tasks, like your morning routine or washing dishes. During 
rote tasks, it is common to find the mind wandering. 
●
●The next time you’re in the midst of a task that seems mindless, try to 
be fully present in that moment. For example, when you’re brushing 
your teeth, pay close attention to the way the bristles feel against your 
teeth and gums. Pay attention to taste changes, to the way the brush 
feels in your hand, and to the sounds caused by the bristles hitting 
your teeth. 
●
●Some people like taking mindful walks, where they fully pay attention 
to their surroundings and sensations: the sense of their feet hitting the 
ground, the chirping birds, the warmth of the sun on their forehead. 
Take some time to think about your own routines and consider where it 
might be best for you to add in some mindfulness to your everyday life. 
●
●Additionally, both the concentration and the mindfulness forms of 
meditation can help you experience the peace that is always present 
in every moment. Experiment with different types of meditation at 
different times of day. You may want to weave a couple of shorter 
practices into your daily life. If you find yourself getting stressed, 
try even a five-minute silent mantra meditation or a brief guided 
mindfulness practice.

Understanding 
Trauma
T
rauma changes brains, bodies, and the way people experience life. This 
class explores what trauma is. It also looks at what is occurring in the 
body and brain as a result of trauma, and at how to respond to trauma in 
a healthy way. 
Defining Trauma
●
●A traumatic event is an experience that is extremely distressing and often 
life-threatening. Trauma can happen as a result of a single event, such 
as a natural disaster, a car accident, or an assault. It can also be complex 
trauma, which is trauma that has occurred over a prolonged period 
of time, such as being in an abusive relationship, living in a war-torn 
country, living in poverty, or experiencing childhood abuse or neglect. 
It can also be traumatic to hear about the trauma that someone else has 
experienced, particularly if it’s someone you’re close to. 

86  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●When you are in danger or perceived danger, the body and brain respond 
in a way designed to keep you safe. Common responses include the fight-
or-flight reflex, but there are also other ways that the body responds to 
danger, too. Sometimes people freeze, just like a deer attempting not to 
be seen. Sometimes people scream or cry for help. 
●
●When all else fails, sometimes people submit. When you submit, the 
brain goes into a state of hypo-arousal. The purpose of this response 
is to shut down the experience of thought and emotion so that you 
aren’t as present for the trauma. 
●
●The stress, panic, anxiety, and terror that happen as a result of a 
trauma are all normal, and they typically last for a few weeks following 
the traumatic event. However, if a person is experiencing complex 
trauma or their fight-or-flight reflex doesn’t successfully help escape 
the danger, the person is more likely to develop symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can last for a lifetime if 
left untreated. 

Class 11 | Understanding Trauma  |  87
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
The rates of PTSD following two national disasters—the 9/11 attacks 
on the World Trade Center and Hurricane Katrina—are illuminating. 
While statistics vary, there are some significant statistics showing that 
5 percent of 9/11 survivors experienced symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress disorder. However, 33 percent of Hurricane Katrina survivors 
developed symptoms of PTSD.

Some experts, including trauma experts, noticed that many survivors 
of 9/11 were able to escape the trauma by walking back to homes 
that were safe. Compare this to survivors of Hurricane Katrina, many 
of whom were stuck on their rooftops with nowhere to run. Survivors 
of Hurricane Katrina were sent to other cities, and many of them 
completely lost the safety and security of having a home and a 
community. Since many of the survivors of Hurricane Katrina were also 
low income, many of them had less access to mental health services 
following the disaster, especially since most of the relief funding was 
spent on relocation and housing issues. 
Trauma and the Brain
●
●When a person experiences a trauma that is too big for the brain to 
process, it becomes stuck in the brain as a current problem rather than 
being stored as a processed memory of a past event. In this condition, 
people often avoid anything that brings reminders of the trauma, 
including thoughts and feelings associated with it. It is also common 
to be hypervigilant, making the person almost always tense and alert. 
●
●When someone has post-traumatic stress, their amygdala is extremely 
reactive, which creates almost a constant flood of stress hormones 

88  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
in the brain. Like stress, trauma also causes the hippocampus to 
shrink. The hippocampus is largely responsible for the ability to 
form memories, and when it shrinks, it becomes harder to process 
events and form memories. When the hippocampus is unable to 
process a memory, all it can do is hold on to the fragmented pieces of 
unprocessed information, which makes it feel like the trauma is still 
a current problem.
●
●Trauma also inhibits the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, which 
makes it difficult to plan, problem solve, and control emotions. One 
part of the prefrontal cortex that is specifically affected by trauma 
is Broca’s area, which controls speech production. This, combined 
with fragmented memories, can make putting trauma into words 
extremely difficult. 
The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma
There are multiple ways that trauma can be passed down from parents 
to their children. Sometimes, people simply have a genetic makeup 
that makes them more vulnerable to stress and trauma, and these 
genotypes are passed to later generations. Trauma can also be passed 
down to children via the environment they’re raised in. However, 
just as trauma can be transmitted from one generation to the next, 
research is showing that resilience patterns can be transmitted from 
one generation to the next, too.
Traumatic Memories
●
●Denial and minimization are two common defense mechanisms that 
people unconsciously use to avoid having to deal with the reality 
of a traumatic experience. These mechanisms are also normal, and 
they do serve a purpose, as they can prevent a person from feeling 
overwhelmed immediately following a trauma or loss. However, a 

Class 11 | Understanding Trauma  |  89
person can only suppress experiences for so long before the underlying 
trauma wreaks havoc on the body and mind. 
●
●Sometimes people don’t recognize or fully experience symptoms of 
post-traumatic stress until months or even years after the trauma. 
Additionally, most people don’t have any conscious memories until 
the age of three, which means it is possible for the body to respond 
to trauma from birth or early childhood that the person doesn’t even 
remember. 
●
●New research is even showing that sometimes the brain stores traumatic 
memories that can only be accessed when the brain is in the same state 
it was in when the original trauma occurred. This state-dependent 
learning explains why people can’t access some traumatic memories 
from a normal state of consciousness; they are only accessible when 
the brain is in the state it was in when the trauma occurred. It also 
explains how environmental triggers that bring the brain back to 
the state it was in when trauma occurred can result in fragmented 
memories of the pain endured. 
Effects of Trauma
●
●It is often the small details that affect trauma survivors the most. Smells, 
sounds, images, and particular thoughts or fears in the moment can 
alter the way one thinks and acts in the wake of a traumatic event. This 
is the way trauma can become insidious and can affect entire lives.
●
●Trauma often disrupts feelings of safety and trust. People can be left 
feeling as though the world is unsafe, and no one can be trusted. They 
can feel unsafe in their environments and sometimes even within their 
bodies. Feeling safe allows people to welcome and respond to what 
happens in their daily lives; however, feeling unsafe can leave people 
stuck in a constant state of looking for threats, making it difficult to 
move on and heal from trauma.

90  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Another common side effect of trauma is dissociation. Dissociation 
leads to feelings of detachment and disbelief, as though the experience 
was not real. A person might feel numb or separate from his or 
her body. Suppressing thoughts and emotions, which can be done 
consciously or subconsciously, is another way a person might try to 
detach from an experience. 
●
●Suppression will only work for so long. Suppressed emotions are likely 
to become triggered and express themselves as anger, rage, or other 
reckless behavior. In order to heal traumatic memories, it is necessary 
to allow thoughts, emotions, and experiences to be expressed and 
acknowledged. 
●
●If suppression is one possible effect of trauma, fusion is another. In 
fusion, a person fuses with his or her experience. In fusion, people 
define themselves by their trauma, or they feel like their lives and 
identities have been entirely taken over by it. The trick is to find 
the sweet spot—that is, to be curious about thoughts and emotions 
without actually identifying with them.
●
●Shame is another feeling that commonly comes after trauma, especially 
interpersonal trauma. Shame is the foundation of so many problems: 
Addiction, violence, and codependency all have roots in shame. It is 
common to interpret internal distress as though something is wrong, 
but this is far from the case. Distress is uncomfortable, but it is normal 
and even purposeful.
A Healthy Conceptualization of Trauma 
●
●Responding to trauma can be difficult, but keep in mind that it is 
normal. If you go through trauma, keep in mind that your responses 
don’t mean you are broken. You are reacting to a distressing event.
●
●When you aren’t afraid of your response, it becomes easier to plan for 
how you will handle it if and when it comes up again. An important 
piece of this is to choose people who are willing to be there when you are 

Class 11 | Understanding Trauma  |  91
reminded of your trauma. Find at least one person—a family member, 
friend, or professional—who won’t tell you to “just get over it.” 
●
●Survivors often feel as though they have to choose between being 
vulnerable or being strong, but the truth is that being vulnerable is 
being strong. Avoidance can keep you stuck, but being vulnerable 
opens you up to your whole experience. Acknowledging trauma 
can certainly be uncomfortable, but this, too, is normal. When you 
acknowledge the sensations, emotions, thoughts, and memories that 
are associated with your trauma, you are able to recognize them as 
little pieces of information that each have a message to share.
●
●You start to see that you are not your trauma; rather, you just went 
through a traumatic experience. When you start to pay attention to 
how your experience has affected you, you are able to find the part of 
you that is unaffected, too—the part of you that is always healthy and 
whole, and that is completely untouched by your traumatic experience.

Discovering Post-
Traumatic Growth
P
eople do not become stronger, wiser, and more resilient in spite of their 
adversity. Rather, people become stronger because of adversity. This 
pattern was noticed by the researchers Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence 
Calhoun, who coined the term post-traumatic growth in 1995. The idea arose 
from their research on parents who were experiencing bereavement after the 
death of a child. While the parents suffered deeply after losing a child, they were 
also reporting many unexpected positive changes that occurred in their lives.
Trauma deepens one’s ability to feel both pain and joy. Real compassion occurs 
when one feels the full spectrum of life so fully that one no longer suppresses 
pain. In many cases, the only choice after a trauma is to feel it. The result is that 
life opens up in new ways. 

94  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Five Areas for Growth
Over time studying a whole range of different traumas, Tedeschi and 
Calhoun noticed five important areas for growth that emerged in 
people who have experienced traumatic situations. These areas are:
1.	
Personal strength.
2.	
New possibilities.
3.	
Cultivation of meaningful relationships.
4.	
Spiritual change.
5.	
Appreciation for life.
This class will now take a look at each of these in turn.
Personal Strength
●
●Both individual and collective strength arise in unexpected ways after 
a trauma. The only way to really build strength is to be tested. When 
you want to build a muscle, you have to apply resistance. To build 
resilience, you need resistance as well. 
●
●Psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth has done some fascinating 
research into this, showing that the most successful adolescents are 
not necessarily the smartest people or those with the most resources. 
Even when compared against many other success factors, including 
test scores and household income, the most successful young people 
are those who have the most grit, which Duckworth defines as the 
combination of passion and perseverance. In her best-selling book 
Grit, she encourages us step out of what is comfortable to discover 
what is possible through embracing adversity.

Class 12 | Discovering Post-Traumatic Growth  |  95
New Possibilities
●
●The second area for post-traumatic growth is the discovery of 
new possibilities. When you experience a trauma, it disrupts your 
worldview. You are forced to re-create your worldview and deepen 
your understanding of life. 
●
●You try new things because the old ways don’t work amidst your 
new reality. You become more creative as you try to process what has 
occurred. You try to reconcile your inner reality with your outside 
world, and a flood of new possibilities comes to the surface.
Cultivation of Meaningful Relationships
●
●The third area for growth after trauma is the cultivation of meaningful 
relationships. While some relationships may be challenged after a 
trauma, people will frequently bond more deeply with the people 
who shared the traumatic experience, or they will cultivate new 
relationships in the aftermath.
●
●Traumatic events tend to remind one of the importance of the people in 
his or her life. As a result, these events create opportunities for people to 
connect with others in new ways. People let themselves be helped, and 
they become more aware of the ways that they can help others. 
Spiritual Change
●
●The fourth area for growth is spiritual change or existential exploration. 
Traumatic experiences can send you into a deeper exploration of your 
belief system. For some people, this can invite questions about if there 
is something transcendent that remains after the human form changes 
or is no longer. 
●
●After experiencing a trauma, people often go through existential 
questioning about the nature of consciousness, whether they embrace 

96  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
a particular religion or not. The exploration often unlocks increased 
faith, meaning, purpose, and conviction. It can also help connect 
people with the part of them that is unchanging.
Appreciation for Life
●
●The fifth area of post-traumatic growth is appreciation for life. When 
people are reminded of the inevitability of their demise, they often 
appreciate their blessings even more. 
●
●Traumatic events also make people want to get the most out of the 
time they have in life. For example, when someone close dies or you 
are reminded of your mortality in some way, you may find a new spark 
of life—that is, a new excitement for being present for the journey.

Class 12 | Discovering Post-Traumatic Growth  |  97
Victim, Survivor, and Changemaker
The five areas of post-traumatic growth form one window for 
observing the many positive things that can emerge from a trauma. 
This class now shifts to another way to look at post-traumatic 
growth—one that is more closely linked to the passage of time. This 
view looks at the three phases someone who undergoes trauma 
goes through: victim, survivor, and changemaker.
The Victim Phase
●
●When a person experiences a trauma, he or she can immediately start 
to feel under attack. Something happened that was out of the person’s 
control. The body may start to feel like the scene of a crime, and it 
may feel like a person can no longer choose his or her path. This 
experience can leave the person feeling like a victim.
●
●Such an experience is entirely normal, and it can even be protective 
at times, but it can also be detrimental. It is important to feel what 
is present when you do find yourself in the role of the victim, but it 
is also important to not get stuck in that stage. You can’t fully grow 
until you have the chance to move through the stage of being a victim.
●
●Signs that a person is in the victim phase include shame and blame 
creeping in with phrases like, “Why me?” or, “How could they have 
done this to me?” A person in the victim phase may feel powerless, 
under attack, and lacking control. The person may exhibit patterns of 
fear-based living, feeling afraid to confront things or engage in a fight. 
●
●Taking on the role of a victim is an entirely normal response after 
a trauma. It can even feel good. There is some initial evidence that 
people actually get a temporary burst of positive endorphins from 
feeling like a victim. This is a dangerous moment of happiness that 
ultimately results in a letdown due to several key factors. 

98  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Though receiving help from others can feel good, this can create a 
situation where codependency can easily develop. Additionally, the 
victim mentality can be a way to avoid personal responsibility and 
an excuse for not taking risks. It is possible to live an entire life as a 
victim by using the story as a reason why not to do something instead 
of using it as an opportunity for personal growth.
The Survivor Phase
●
●To move past the victim mentality, it is important to realize that one 
must give up the benefits of being a victim. Positive endorphin release 
can become a trap and a prison. At some point, to evolve, one has to 
shift from being a victim to being a survivor. 
●
●The difference is that a survivor has choices, while a victim does not. 
Empowerment resides in having a choice. You may not be able to 
control your circumstances, but you can expand the sphere of what is 
actually possible to change. This can give us an intellectual framework 
that can carry us through to the other side. 
●
●It may even be helpful to draw a picture of this out for yourself. 
Draw your current reality inside of an inner circle. For instance, 
your reality might be that you were recently diagnosed with diabetes. 
Then, outside the circle, write the possibilities that are immediately 
accessible to you to change your situation. 
●
●This may simply be a change in mindset, or it may be an even bigger 
life shift, such as taking insulin, changing your diet, or visiting other 
doctors and specialists. Further possibilities could include joining a 
support group or awareness campaign, or writing articles about your 
experience. You can then keep expanding the possibility sphere out 
farther and farther to imagine what the ultimate possibilities are for 
you in this situation. 

Class 12 | Discovering Post-Traumatic Growth  |  99
●
●A survivor also cultivates gratitude. Gratitude helps you see everything 
that is going right in your life instead of everything that is going 
wrong in it. 
●
●You might even talk to your trauma and say, “You don’t get the right 
to steal my future from me. I’m going to learn from this and move 
past it.” From there, you can start finding solutions. Vulnerability still 
may be present, but this is when the notion that you are surviving and 
thriving begins to arise.
The Changemaker Phase
●
●Developing the notion of surviving and thriving is essential to reaching 
the third phase of post-traumatic growth: becoming a changemaker. 
A changemaker operates from an empowered view, realizing the 
changemaker has the capacity to create meaningful change—in both 
the changemaker’s life and those of others. 
●
●Moving from a victim mentality to a changemaker mentality may 
seem impossible or scary, and sometimes you will fail. However, you 
will never find your best if you don’t try. 
●
●Post-traumatic growth happens when you lean into your journey and 
discover how to live at the fullest potential of your true self. For some 
people, a trauma can transform from feeling like the worst thing to 
the best thing that ever happened to them because it started them on 
their way.

his class consists of an interview 
with Suzi Landolphi, a leader in the 
post-traumatic growth movement. 
For over 10 years, she has been providing 
horse-inspired growth and healing as well 
as other therapeutic activities for many 
different community, social service, and 
clinical organizations. She currently works 
at Boulder Crest Retreat in Bluemont, 
Virginia, as a PATHH Guide. PATHH—
or Progressive and Alternative Training for 
Healing Heroes—is a quickly expanding

retreat program created by and for combat veterans that is based on 30 years of 
research on post-traumatic growth.
This guidebook chapter contains summarized information from Landolphi’s 
interview. To see or hear the full interview, refer to the audio or video class. If 
you have obtained a transcript book, you can also read the full interview there.
The Idea of Post-Traumatic Growth
●
●According to Landolphi, the idea of post-traumatic growth has always 
been around. Ancient and indigenous peoples have always known 
about the idea that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and 
that you get gifts from trauma. The idea of the multigenerational 
transmission of trauma also points to the idea of multigenerational 
transmission of growth and gifts. 
●
●While researchers Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun were 
studying the idea of where wisdom comes from, they were asked to go 
to a support group for parents who had lost their child. They started 
to hear about how these parents had formed deeper relationships—
that they created, for instance, a foundation to build baseball teams in 
inner cities because their son loved baseball. They had great personal 
strength, a great appreciation for life, and an understanding that life 
has a spiritual existence.
●
●Of course they would want to have their child back. However, their 
trauma actually brought them some great wisdom and growth. 
Boulder Crest Retreat
●
●Boulder Crest Retreat was founded by US Navy veteran Ken Falke 
and his wife Julia. Their inspiration came while visiting wounded 
veterans who handled explosive ordnance disposal. Eventually, the 
couple formed Boulder Crest Retreat to help such veterans.

Class 13 | Suzi Landolphi on Post-Traumatic Growth  |  103
●
●Landolphi soon began working with the retreat. She and the Falkes 
found that the veterans who suffered the most from post-traumatic 
stress disorder also had the worst childhoods. 
●
●For example, a person could have a horrific childhood, grow up, use 
the gifts of trauma to become a great soldier, suffer a wound in the 
line of duty, and then return home to the site 
of their original trauma. Their home may be 
a place a trauma occurred that the veteran 
never disclosed. 
●
●At Boulder Crest, emotional regulation is a 
large focus. Specific techniques used include 
archery and transcendental meditation. 
●
●Another important idea is that you can only 
control your own life; however, when other 
people see you change, they may change 
as well. If you appreciate life more and 
appreciate new possibilities, there is a high 
likelihood you will develop a deeper or better 
connection with the people around you. 
●
●Those people who cannot change have the 
right not to do so. However, you also have 
a right to not be close to them and set 
boundaries.
Creating New Possibilities
●
●Landolphi points to a person’s principles as 
a great tool for creating new possibilities for 
oneself. Keep in mind that principles are very 
different from your personality. In essence, 
principles are true guidelines that you will 
not cross. Moreover, you will not cross them 
Forgiving Your 
Imperfections
An additional 
idea espoused 
by Landolphi 
is to accept 
imperfections. 
An attachment 
to perfection will 
lead to suffering. 
If you make a 
mistake, accept 
it and move 
on. You can 
always go back 
and apologize. 
This plays into 
the definition 
of success at 
Boulder Crest 
Retreat, which is 
“to be better than 
I was yesterday.”

104  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
because you believe in them. They honor yourself and everything you 
care about.
●
●Try coming up with three to five principles that you will use every 
time you make a decision. For instance, if you are faced with a 
choice where one option goes against your principles, then making 
your decision should become easier. Examples of principles include 
integrity, kindness, and honesty.

Cultivating 
Community and 
Connection
I
t is normal to feel lonely once in a while, 
but feelings of persistent loneliness are 
unfortunately increasing in society. The 
antidote to loneliness is genuine connection 
with others. This class looks at several 
methods to help you build those connections. 
Fostering Connection
●
●Humans are wired for connection. 
Research on babies shows that 
they need touch for cognitive 
development. 
Even 
more, 
all 
humans have mirror neurons that 
mimic the emotions and behavior 
There is a difference 
between being lonely 
and being alone. A 
person living alone might 
not feel lonely because 
of the quality of their 
friendships, whereas a 
person surrounded by 
people all day could 
still feel lonely because 
those relationships lack 
connection. 

106  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
of people they interact with. People learn how to be human from 
other humans. That’s why friendships and other relationships are 
central to your ability to thrive and be resilient.
●
●Connections start with trust. Trust happens when you feel that a person 
genuinely cares about your well-being. When people feel mutual 
concern for each other’s well-being, that creates true friendship.
●
●This doesn’t mean that you have to be a social butterfly. Having four 
to five very close friends is more effective than having lots of casual 
friends. The most important factors in a friendship include trust, 
dependability, and genuine enjoyment in your friend’s company. 
●
●Ultimately, much of one’s ability to connect comes down to belief 
systems and attitude. If a person judges or rejects those who are 
supposedly different, those people will shut down, and the rejector 
will ultimately feel more separate and isolated. If one wants to truly 

Class 14 | Cultivating Community and Connection  |  107
rid society of loneliness, one has to open up to genuinely connecting 
with others. The more compassionate a person is of others, the easier 
it is to connect. 
●
●It is also possible—and sometimes even easier—to form meaningful 
connections with animals, especially mammals. Horses and dogs are 
commonly used in trauma treatment to help clients develop a sense of 
connection and safety. Service animals, support animals, and pets can 
also be dependable friends. 
●
●Community group practices like group chanting, breathing, singing, 
and dancing are also extremely effective at fostering connection with 
others, in part due to their ability to regulate bodily states and help 
process experiences. These practices are less common in the West, but 
they are seen quite prominently in other traditions and cultures. 
Cultivating Community
●
●To cultivate your sense of community, you can start by nourishing 
the important relationships you already have. For example, you might 
reconnect with an old friend and devote the time and space to really 
listening to what they have to say. If you’re looking to expand your 
community, see if you can create opportunities to spend time with 
people who share a mutual interest, such as joining an exercise group, 
volunteering on a political campaign, going to dog parks, starting a 
book club, and so on. 
●
●Remember that what you put into your relationships and community 
is what you’ll get out of it. Many people complain they don’t have 
community, but at the same time, they haven’t done much to create or 
nourish their community. It’s also important to pay attention to what 
you choose to do with your community. For instance, does getting 
together always mean drinking together, or can you connect over 
other interests? 

108  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Co-Meditation
●
●Co-meditation is a powerful and practical tool that you can use to 
strengthen your relationship and connection with others. It is a great 
way to practice deep listening and being truly present with the people 
in your life. 
●
●Co-meditation is a partner practice that is easy to do and takes a 
surprisingly short amount of time to bring you fully into the present 
moment. Once you’ve found someone to try this with, decide who is 
going to start as the giver of undivided attention and who will be the 
receiver of undivided attention. 
●
●You’ll switch halfway through, so each person will have the opportunity 
to practice both supporting someone and being supported. The only 
real instruction is this: Sit across from each other and see what happens. 
●
●You can sit there until each person’s turn reaches its natural end, or 
you may want to set a timer, perhaps between 15 and 30 minutes 
per person, so that you are not distracted by trying to keep track of 
time during the meditation. Some people prefer to go back and forth 
multiple times at shorter intervals, like two or five minutes, rather 
than each person taking a prolonged turn. Choose whatever feels right 
for you. 
●
●Once you are sitting across from each other, let the receiver of 
undivided attention lead the way. He or she might want to sit there 
in silence, with eyes open or closed. Alternatively, this could be used 
as an opportunity for the recipient to take a look at and share what is 
going on in their inner world. 
●
●If the recipient would like to spend their time diving into self-inquiry, 
the person giving attention can start by asking the recipient to let 
attention wander throughout their body to see if there are any feelings, 
emotions, or beliefs that are calling their attention. Allow your partner 
to verbally and nonverbally explore what comes to the surface. 

Class 14 | Cultivating Community and Connection  |  109
●
●Throughout the experience, the person giving attention can ask the 
recipient the following three questions: What do you notice? Where 
in your body do you feel this? Can you say anything else about that? 
These questions can be asked as many times as necessary until the 
person receiving attention feels as though they’ve processed whatever 
has come up. 
●
●The listener can also take notes on what the person sharing has to 
say. These notes can be a powerful tool for self-reflection after the 
meditation is over. At the end, ask the recipient if there are any 
takeaways. Also ask if there is anything he or she needs to feel complete 
in that moment. 
Giving Back
●
●Another way to benefit from connection is to give back to your 
community. A study on 750 former prisoners of war found incredible 
resilience among these veterans. Once they were released from 
imprisonment, they avoided developing depression and PTSD, two 
diagnoses that are very common among veterans. Results from the study 
showed that altruism was one of the most important characteristics that 
set them apart and resulted in their impressive resilience.
●
●Giving back through money and time obviously benefits the recipients 
of help, but numerous studies also show significant benefits for the 
giver. Additionally, according to neuroscientist Richard Davidson, the 
brain has four circuits that impact one’s sense of well-being: one for 
maintaining positive states, one for bouncing back from negative states, 
one for attention focusing, and one entirely devoted to generosity.
●
●Studies have shown that as a person spends more money on others, 
the spender experiences more happiness. Functional MRI scans show 
that giving money to charity activates brain regions associated with 
pleasure and reward, like the ventral striatum.

110  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●The research isn’t limited to the effects of giving money. Research 
also shows that volunteering one’s time results in improved happiness 
as well. Some research even suggests that volunteering reduces the 
likelihood of developing depression, improves physical health and 
reduces cognitive decline as a person ages, and lowers the likelihood 
of early mortality.
●
●People can be both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated. Extrinsic 
motivation involves something from the outside influencing one’s 
behavior, such as working to earn money, attending a lecture to get free 
food, or studying to avoid failing a test. Intrinsic motivation comes from 
within—that is, doing something because it is personally rewarding. 
●
●Intrinsic motivation leads to higher life satisfaction. Studies show that 
volunteers typically choose to give back due to intrinsic motivation 
as opposed to extrinsic. People who value their intrinsic life goals 
derive more benefit and satisfaction from volunteering than people 

Class 14 | Cultivating Community and Connection  |  111
who are more focused on their extrinsic goals, like social standing and 
career status.

Class 15
Finding Safety
S
afety is central to your ability to be resilient. Feeling unsafe keeps the 
brain in survival mode, but feeling safe promotes feelings of security, 
equanimity, and calm. This class explores the very fundamental need of 
safety. It starts by looking at childhood to see how a person’s earliest experiences 
influence how safe the person feels in this world. Then, the class provides some 
internal and external strategies for promoting feelings of safety. The class ends 
by exploring the connection between safety and trust. 
Attachment Theory
●
●A person’s sense of safety and trust depends largely on circumstances 
and life experiences, especially those from the formative years of 
development. Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and Mary 
Ainsworth, delves into the importance of a person’s earliest relationships. 

Class 15 | Finding Safety  |  113
●
●According to attachment theory, everyone has an attachment style, 
which describes how a person relates to others, especially how one 
responds when feeling hurt or threatened. This attachment style goes 
all the way back to experiences in childhood. 
●
●Children form an attachment to adults out of a need for safety and 
protection. The way in which that need is met or not met affects 
people throughout their lives. A person’s attachment style depends on 
the quality of the relationship the person had with his or her primary 
caregivers as a child. It can also be affected by trauma and other 
significant interpersonal events. 
●
●Broadly speaking, attachment styles fall into two categories: secure 
and insecure. A secure attachment style occurs when parents are 
aware of their child’s needs and consistently attend to these needs. In 
a secure attachment, a child seeks out his or her caregiver during times 
of distress, and the caregiver lovingly responds to the child’s needs. 

114  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Secure children generally feel safe and have trust in themselves and in 
the world. As a result, they begin to form attitudes and habits that can 
support resilience in later life. Secure children develop the ability to 
cope with stress, relate with others in a healthy way, and have a solid 
sense of self. 
●
●An insecure attachment style occurs when caregivers are not physically 
or emotionally responsive to their child’s needs. There are three main 
types of insecure attachment. One is characterized by ambivalent 
feelings toward caregivers. The second is characterized by dismissive 
feelings toward caregivers.
●
●The third is disorganized attachment, which is when parents 
essentially pass their own trauma to their children through fear 
tactics, causing children to feel afraid of the same person they seek 
safety from. Insecure attachment can cause children to have difficulty 
regulating their emotions, to see the world as being unsafe, to lack 
trust in people, to have low self-worth, and to believe that people—
including themselves—aren’t capable of meeting their needs. 
●
●As you reflect on your own childhood experiences, you may find that 
they line up with an insecure attachment style. Luckily, change is 
possible. Positive relationships with other figures like mentors, friends, 
family members, and therapists can help change insecure attachment 
into more secure attachment. You can also learn important techniques 
to feel safe inside of yourself and to cultivate a sense of healthy, safe 
attachment with others.
Creating an Inner Resource
●
●Creating an inner resource is one technique for making an internal 
sense of well-being. Your inner resource is a haven of inner peace, 
safety, stillness, and serenity. 
●
●Everyone has their own unique inner resource: It is already hardwired 
into your central nervous system, waiting to be called so that it can 

Class 15 | Finding Safety  |  115
offer you feelings of ease and serenity. Your inner resource helps 
you combat negative experiences by allowing you to remember the 
unchanging wholeness and security that exists inside of you, no 
matter what is going on in your outside world.
●
●To find your inner resource, think back to a real or imaginary place 
or situation that evokes a feeling of well-being. It could be a home, 
a room, a place in nature, the night sky, or anything else that gives 
you feelings of ease and security. It might include loved ones, pets, a 
spiritual figure you connect with, or objects, such as a favorite stuffed 
animal. Some people prefer an imaginary inner resource, such as 
floating on a cloud.
●
●You can use the imagery and sensorial experiences to evoke an internal 
sense of well-being. As you continue to cultivate this internal sense of 
safety and well-being, you may not need the imagery any longer and 
can simply just drop back into an internal feeling of safety and security.
●
●You can return to your inner resource at any time, day or night. When 
you bring to mind your inner resource frequently—during both hard and 
good times—you’ll be reminded that it is always there to support you. 
The Spiral Technique
●
●Some types of mental health treatment use concepts similar to an 
inner resource, such as the safe place used in EMDR therapy. EMDR, 
or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, is a form of 
psychotherapy that helps the body heal from unprocessed trauma. 
Another technique used in EMDR is the spiral technique, which is a 
way you can work with uncomfortable emotions. 
●
●For this technique, start by bringing to mind an image that represents 
the uncomfortable emotion for you. As you do this, notice where in 
your body you have feelings of discomfort. Then take that feeling and 
pretend it is a spiral of energy, spinning in one direction or another. 
Is the spiral spinning clockwise or counter-clockwise? Depending on 

116  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
what you answer, gently try to change the direction that the energy is 
spinning in your body. 
●
●While all techniques work better for some people than they do for 
others, those who find this technique successful will say that the 
uncomfortable emotions start to disappear when they make their 
spiral start to spin in the opposite direction. Similar to the inner 
resource, this tool can be used to bring you back to feelings of safety 
and calm. 
Protective Factors
●
●Every person has risk factors and protective factors that affect 
their ability to bounce back from adversity. Naturally, risk factors 
are correlated with negative outcomes, and protective factors are 
correlated with more positive outcomes. Some examples of risk factors 
are child abuse and neglect, poverty, neighborhood violence, parents 
who use substances or who have mental health issues, and limited 
economic opportunities.
●
●Conversely, you can increase the number of protective factors in your 
life to increase your sense of safety. Think about what gives you a sense 
of protection and safety, and consider how you can build up these 
factors. It can be helpful to make a list and then create a timeline for 
when and how you are going to increase these protective factors in 
your life.
Prevention Strategies
●
●Another way to promote safety is through the use of prevention 
strategies. Prevention strategies involve setting yourself up for success. 
It can be easy to think of prevention strategies that help with physical 
safety—regular car maintenance, using seat belts, and so on—but 
prevention strategies can be used to support your sense of emotional 
and interpersonal safety, too. 

Class 15 | Finding Safety  |  117
●
●Using your inner resource is an example of an emotional prevention 
strategy. When you use your inner resource after noticing the first 
signs of a trigger, you are preventing a larger emotional reaction by 
calming yourself and focusing on your inner resource. 
●
●Boundary setting is another prevention strategy. If you struggle 
with asserting or sticking up for yourself, it can be helpful to enter 
situations with a plan for how you will respond if someone tries to 
cross your boundary. In order to do this, you’ll have to establish what 
your boundary is ahead of time, too. 
●
●One method is to establish a plan to make sure you’re not left alone 
with someone who scares you. Another tactic is to think ahead of time 
about what you’ll say and do if someone treats you disrespectfully. 
Safety and Trust
●
●Trust is the foundation of your ability to feel safe. When you feel 
safe, you feel protected from harm, meaning you trust the people and 
things that are there to protect you. 
●
●Understanding how you trust—in other words, understanding what 
it is that causes you to give trust and to whom—is key to promoting 
personal safety and resilience. When you are aware of your own trust 
patterns, it becomes easier to capitalize on what works and change 
what is holding you back, allowing you to navigate relationships and 
evaluate your feelings of safety with more ease.
●
●To understand your own trust patterns, think of a person that you 
trust or don’t trust. Ask yourself questions to dig into why it is that 
you do or don’t trust them. Examples of such questions include:
1.	 Do you trust their dependability? 
2.	 Do you trust their physical, emotional, and intellectual capability? 

118  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
3.	 Is their behavior consistent? 
4.	 Do they have and live by a moral code, even when times get hard? 
5.	 Do they have genuine care for your well-being, or does their 
interaction with you seem to be self-serving or transactional in 
nature? 
6.	 Do they try to understand you, or do they judge you and impose 
their own beliefs on you?

●Run through this list of questions a few times, each time with a 
different person in mind. See if you can notice patterns for when 
you do or don’t tend to trust someone in the various circumstances 
of your life. Think about the role that these patterns play in your life, 
especially in terms of your own personal resilience. 
Trusting Yourself
●
●Trusting yourself is an important part of your ability to be resilient. 
You might feel entirely safe and secure one moment, only to be hit by 
a natural or personal disaster that eradicates those feelings of safety. 
The only thing you truly have full control over is yourself, which 
makes trusting in yourself paramount.
●
●The best way to do this is to practice having consistent feelings of 
safety and trust in yourself and in your purpose. It can be helpful to 
evaluate how much you trust yourself, which can also give you clues 
as to how trustworthy you appear to others, too.
●
●To conduct that self-evaluation, here are a few questions that may be 
helpful: 
1.	 Am I dependable? 
2.	 Do I have and live by a moral code, even when times get hard? 

Class 15 | Finding Safety  |  119
3.	 Do I understand myself, or do I judge myself and hide who I 
really am? 
4.	 Do I genuinely care about my well-being? 
5.	 Do I trust in my ability to keep working toward my higher goal 
and purpose? 
●
●If your answer to any of these questions is no, try not to worry. You 
may have just unearthed something that will ultimately help you 
boost your sense of trust in yourself and your resilience. 
●
●If you feel comfortable doing so, do some self-investigation into 
what lies beneath your lack of self-trust, looking for where it comes 
from, what contributes to it, and what you can do to develop self-
trust. Support is paramount to safety, so if the thought of this self-
investigation is overwhelming, think about reaching out to a mental 
health professional who can help support you through the process.

120  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Another way of measuring how much you trust yourself is to keep 
a record of the lies you tell. Lies distance a person from living a 
complete, peaceful, authentic life. People typically lie when and where 
they feel the most vulnerable. You can learn a lot about yourself by 
becoming conscious of the times you lie. 
●
●To do this, use a small journal or your phone, and start to write down 
every time that you lie. Look through your list and ask yourself why 
you told each lie. See the places where you’re going away from the truth. 
See what patterns emerge. This activity acts as a mirror that reflects the 
places where you’re suffering in life. The ultimate goal is to make the 
person in the mirror look the same as the person you see inside. 
●
●Feeling safe with yourself creates a healthy place for you to reside. It 
also creates the opportunity for others to feel safer with you. When 
you’re able to be authentic—speaking your truth rather than living 
behind a façade—you liberate others to be authentic with you, too.

Class 16
Opening to Joy 
and Gratitude
E
veryone wants to feel happy, but people often spend more time chasing it 
outside of themselves than they do cultivating and nourishing an internal 
experience of joy, peace, and happiness. True, authentic joy arises from 
a deep connection with who you truly are and how that truth expresses itself in 
the world. Moreover, joy is an essential part of resilience, so this class looks at 
ways you can open yourself up to experiencing joy.
Desmond Tutu on Joy
On the subject of joy, South African cleric and activist Desmond Tutu 
has this to say: “Joy is much bigger than happiness. While happiness 
is often seen as being dependent on external circumstances, joy is 
not. … [As] we discover more joy, we can face suffering in a way that 
ennobles rather than embitters. We have hardship without becoming 
hard. We have heartbreak without being broken.” 

Class 16 | Opening to Joy and Gratitude  |  123
Perspective
●
●To find joy, perspective is essential. Typically, if a person has a narrow 
or small view on life, the person will descend into judgments, anger, 
and fear. A broader view helps one realize that while problems may be 
present, they are not the only things that are present. 
●
●Part of broadening your perspective includes taking responsibility 
for your joy and peace, rather than depending upon it to come from 
outside of yourself. A willingness to participate in life is a form of 
taking responsibility for your experience. The power is in your hands 
to choose how you meet this life.
●
●Blaming other people or circumstances for one’s misfortune is a sure 
sign that a person’s perspective has grown too narrow. When blaming 
starts, people automatically put themselves in the role of the victim, 
and then everything brings them down because they feel like life is 
happening “to” them. It is a sign that they are trying to source joy 
outside of themselves. 
●
●Sometimes the world may leave you feeling powerless and like life is 
shooting arrows at you. In some sense, you may externally be powerless, 
but you can affect your internal experience. When those arrows start 
to fly, you can shift your perspective from what is coming at you to an 
internal space of wholeness and then focus on what you are putting into 
the world. When you do this, you take your power back.
Experiencing Challenges
●
●Please keep in mind that experiencing authentic joy does not mean 
you override the challenges you are feeling. Experiencing joy doesn’t 
mean forcing yourself into a false sense of optimism or positivity. 
Rather, you are setting yourself free to experience everything that is 
present. When resistance drops, joy arises.

124  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●There is a huge sense of freedom and relief found in not trying to keep 
all of the difficult emotions and memories buried somewhere deep 
inside. When you feel connected to life and safe in yourself, it allows 
you to feel emotions like anger and fear without getting hijacked by 
them, because that deeper sense of well-being is also present. This is 
where the resilience resides. 
Mindfulness and Joy
●
●This kind of connection can be cultivated through mindfulness 
practices, which recognize that authentic gratitude and joy contains 
all emotions, even sadness and anger. Authentic gratitude and joy 
honors and holds a person’s full experience.
●
●When you think your life is only going to be happy, peaceful, or 
prosperous, you put yourself in a trap and place conditions on your 
well-being. Keep in mind that every moment brings the possibility 

Class 16 | Opening to Joy and Gratitude  |  125
of experiencing joy. Gratitude and welcoming open the door to 
this possibility. 
●
●When people are caught in a storm of emotions, they often try to 
pull something closer or push something else away. This pulling 
and pushing actually takes people farther and farther away from the 
happiness that they seek. The reason for this is that true, lasting joy 
is not dependent upon anything outside of yourself. True joy is an 
internal experience. 
●
●When there is a willingness to meet life and all of your emotions, there 
is joy in the midst of it. Cultivating traits like forgiveness, compassion, 
and generosity supports your ability to experience this unchanging, 
internal joy. 
●
●Internal joy can arise through having deeper connection and gratitude, 
but you can also use external joy to help evoke a sense of internal joy. 
External joy is the type of joy that is evoked from things outside of 
yourself. For example, it is delightful to be together with your favorite 
people, sharing a meal or accomplishing a goal together.
●
●The problem with external joy is that if that source of joy goes 
away, the joy starts to go away, too. Even so, by using mindfulness 
techniques, you can use external sources of joy to connect with a 
deeper sense of internal joy. For a brief mindfulness practice, refer to 
the audio or video class.

Class 17
Practice 1: Building 
Resilience
T
his practice class is focused on building resilience through yoga, and this 
guidebook chapter provides background information on the practice 
as well as images of the poses. Refer to the video class for additional 
guidance on the class’s poses, including chair variations.
If you are using a chair, make sure it is a steady one. Do not use a chair that 
could move around or slip on the floor. Some people like putting their chair on 
a yoga mat or a non-slip surface.
Keep in mind that yoga is a nurturing practice. It should make your body feel 
good. If something doesn’t feel right for you, don’t do it, or find an adaptation 
that does feel good to you. If you have any doubts about if your body is capable 
of doing the activities in this class, please consult your doctor first.

128  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Breathing
●
●Throughout the practice, you’ll be using a technique called ujjayi 
breathing, which is an inhalation and exhalation through the nose. 
This is designed to warm the breath, which helps the body warm up 
as well. 
Pose Information: Sun Salutations
●
●This class’s first pose involves sun salutations. You can think of sun 
salutations as yoga warm-up exercises. Sun salutations have historic 
roots back in the Himalayas, where people would go on pilgrimage 
to a sacred temple or site. They would take 10 steps and then bow 
down, performing an act of prostration or gratitude to give thanks 
for all the blessings in their life. They would also give thanks for the 
sun, the ultimate source of life, which is why the practice is called sun 
salutations, or Surya Namaskar in Sanskrit.
Sun Salutation

Class 17 | Practice 1: Building Resilience  |  129
Pose Information: Boat Pose
●
●After working through sun salutations, the class turns to the boat 
pose. For the boat pose, if you’re in the chair, you can lift your legs up 
and then bend your knees so that your knees are coming in toward 
your body. You can either hold behind your thighs and lift up, or you 
can start to straighten the legs. You should be using your abdominal 
strength here. 
●
●If you’re on the ground, there are two variations. You can bring your 
knees up, bent, and bring your arms out alongside the calves. If 
you need to, you can hold on behind the legs. For a more advanced 
variation, you can extend the legs out and extend the arms, keeping 
the spine straight. This pose builds core strength. It is also a nice 
balance pose. 
Boat Pose

130  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Pose Information: Child’s Pose
●
●From the boat pose, you will lower and rotate yourself around into the 
child’s pose. If you’re sitting in a chair, you can relax the head down 
for a moment, with the hands in a comfortable neutral position. If 
you’re on the ground, you can either have your knees together or 
separate. You can have your arms straight out, or you can relax them 
back by your feet. Do what feels best to you. 
Pose Information: Dolphin Pose
●
●Next up is the dolphin pose. For the dolphin pose, if you’re in a chair, 
put your hands on the arms of the chair. Try to keep the elbows in as 
you lift your body up and then place it back down again. You can do 
this several times, but take a break at any point you need to. If you’d 
like to increase the challenge, you can hold yourself up in the position.
Child’s Pose

Class 17 | Practice 1: Building Resilience  |  131
●
●For the floor version, position your elbows under the shoulders, and 
then interlace your hands in front of you. This may be as much as you 
want to do, and that’s fine. This pose is a way to build strength in the 
upper body and abdomen. 
●
●If you would like to go farther, you can bring the chin down, and then 
lift the back up before coming back down. Exhale on the downward 
movement and inhale on the upward movement. Try not to drop the 
hips when you come down, instead keeping the back straight.
●
●If this is too hard, you can also bring your knees down onto the mat, 
and then do the same position, swimming like a dolphin dives: down 
and up. You can do about 10 repetitions of this pose in whatever style 
you’d like. When you’re finished, come back into the child’s pose.
Dolphin’s Pose

132  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Pose Information: Tree Pose
●
●After returning to child’s pose, the practice shifts into standing poses, 
starting with the tree pose. If you don’t have a chair and you would 
like extra support, you can always use a wall. 
●
●For the tree pose, find a position where your left foot can root down. 
Put the heel down and then slowly spread out the toes. Next, bend 
into the knee. You should feel like you have roots extending down 
from your foot into the earth. Keep in mind that balance is in large 
part a function of your gaze. When you’re doing the tree pose, make 
sure your eyes are fixed on a stationary point on the floor. 
●
●After rooting down through the left foot, a couple of variations are 
available. You can tuck the right foot gently up into the inside of your 
left leg, or you can draw it up a little farther onto your calf.
●
●Never put the foot right on the knee. This could damage the knee. 
However, you can bring the foot up into the inside of the thigh, or 
you can bring the foot all the way up into a half lotus pose if you are 
confident that you can hold the pose in that position. 
●
●Bring the hands up into a prayer position if you’re standing. If you’re 
using a chair, you can you leave your hand on the chair. If standing, 
you can lift the arms up, though this is optional. 
●
●If your hands are out, slowly bring them back into the prayer position. 
Next, release the hands and release the leg down. Wiggle your arms 
and legs, shaking out the body. 
●
●Next, bring the right foot forward. Spread out the toes, and then 
root the foot down. You should feel the thigh muscles start to engage. 
Bend into the right knee, and then slowly find your position with the 
left foot, sliding it up any amount onto the right leg. Again, hold onto 
a wall or a chair if that’s helpful for you. 

Class 17 | Practice 1: Building Resilience  |  133
Tree Pose

134  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●If you’d like, you can elevate your arms up. Breathe and keep rooting 
down through the foot as the head lifts up toward the sky. Slowly, on 
a deep inhalation, draw the hands into your heart. Release the arms 
and relax, and then shake everything out again. 
Pose Information: Triangle Pose
●
●Next up is the triangle pose. You can put your right hand on a chair 
for support, or place it on your thigh. Separate your legs. For this 
pose, you will want the foot that is facing out to be pointed directly 
out. The foot on the backside should be pointed slightly in.
●
●If your hand is on your thigh, slide your hand down the leg, and then 
bring the right arm out in front of you and swing it up over your ear. 
Try to make your body flat. If it’s not, you can also take the back foot 
out a little bit more. Once you practice, you’ll find the right distance 
for you.
Triangle Pose

Class 17 | Practice 1: Building Resilience  |  135
●
●The other option is to swing the arm up and around, and then tuck 
your chin into your chest, pressing into the feet for strength and 
lifting the body up. After that, switch sides. If you’re using the chair, 
turn your body so that the left foot is facing forward and the left hand 
is on the chair. 
●
●If you’re on the ground, turn the left toes out and the right toes in. 
Bring the left hand onto the thigh or chair, and then bring your right 
arm up and slide yourself over. If desired, you can swing the right 
hand up and over the ear. Breathe deeply. 
Pose Information: Warrior Pose
●
●Next, slowly come up and prepare for the warrior pose. Separate 
your feet a bit wider than they were during the triangle pose. As you 
come down, bend into your right knee, then look down. You want 
your knee to be over your ankle. Once you’re in position, tuck your 
tailbone under and then inhale, extending your arms out. Place your 
gaze over your right middle finger.
●
●You should feel like you’re sitting your hips down as the head lifts up. 
If you’re using a chair, your arm can be extended out, and the eyes 
should be focused outward. If you need to come out of the pose at 
any point, do so.
●
●When you’re ready, slowly come up and step your left foot forward. 
Bring your right leg back. Once again, make sure your feet are wide, 
and bend into your front left knee. Look down and make sure your 
knee is right over the ankle. The right toes should be pointed in at a 
45-degree angle. Tuck your tailbone under. 
●
●Extend your arms out, and gaze over the left middle finger. Keep 
dropping the hips down and elevating the crown of the head. Next, 
step your foot up to the top of your mat; if you’re using the chair or 
have otherwise modified the move, you can sit down once more.

136  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●If you are not using a chair, the next phase involves coming down 
onto the ground. Lift your arms up parallel with the ground. Start to 
sit down, and then slowly use your hands to lower yourself down. This 
will lead to a reclined spinal twist if you’re on the ground.
●
●If you’re in a chair, start by bringing your left hand onto your right knee. 
Then, you can place the right hand wherever it feels good to you. It can 
go on the arm of the chair or behind your back to perform a final twist.
●
●If you’re on the ground, lift up your right foot and place it just above 
the left knee. Place your left hand on the right knee and pull it gently 
over to the side. The right arm extends out. Gaze toward your right 
arm. Start breathing up and down the spinal column. Feeling with 
each breath that you’re soothing your nervous system, releasing any 
tension in the spine.
●
●Next, if you’re in the chair, bring your right hand on your left knee, 
bring your right hand onto your left knee and twist your body to 
Warrior Pose

Class 17 | Practice 1: Building Resilience  |  137
the left side. If you’re working from the ground, bring the foot just 
above the right knee, moving the left knee over to the right. The left 
arm extends, and your gaze will go over to the left. Once again, take 
long, deep breathes up and down the spine, feeling as if each breath is 
nourishing your spinal column. 
●
●Come back to center and extend the leg out. If you’re lying on the 
ground or working from the chair, you can give your body a hug. Give 
yourself credit for nourishing your body and mind.
Pose Information: Shavasana
●
●This class’s final relaxation pose is called shavasana. If you’re in a 
chair, feel free to scoot toward the back of the chair and make any 
adjustments you need to be comfortable. If you’re on the ground, 
bring your feet about mat-distance apart and let the toes fall out to the 
Shavasana

138  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
side. Roll the shoulder blades back and down together. Let the palms 
face up in an open, receptive position.
●
●If there’s any tension in the neck, you can turn your head to the right 
and the left a couple of times. When you’ve released the neck tension, 
tuck your chin into your chest to elongate the backside of the neck, 
and then let your neck find a neutral position. Feel the whole plane of 
contact between the body and the surface beneath you.
●
● Observe the experience of your physical body, noticing all the 
physical sensations that are present. Then, if you’d like, take a few 
long, deep breaths to release any lingering tension that may be present 
in your body. Observe the state of your mind, welcoming any feelings 
or emotions and beliefs. 
●
●Fill your heart so that it feels soft, open, alive, strong, and peaceful 
at the same time. You’re welcome to stay here as long as you would 
like, resting in the stillness. When you’re done, take a break of 5 to 10 
minutes before returning to your day.

Class 18
Practice 2:
De-stressing with 
Your Breath
T
his class goes through several different breathing practices that you can 
do in your daily life. Each breath has purpose for practicing, though all 
can be a good way to calm yourself and refocus. 
The Three-Part Yoga Breath
●
●To prepare for this class’s first breath—the three-part yoga breath—
place your right hand on your belly and your left hand on your chest. 
Close your eyes, and then notice where you are breathing. Observe 
the pattern of your breath. This is relevant because when people 
become stressed, they only breathe up into the very top of the lungs, 
or a bit into the chest. To relax, you will instead breathe consciously 
down into your abdomen.
●
●For this practice, breathe through your nose as much as possible. Take 
a deep breath, in through the nose, and send it down into your belly. 

140  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Expand your belly like a balloon, and then breathe up into your chest 
all the way up to the clavicle. As you exhale, squeeze your abdomen 
back in toward your spine. Take several more deep, three-part breaths 
like this.
●
●Close your eyes once more, observing the normal pattern of your 
breath. While inhaling, notice how long your inhalation lasts. 
However long that is, exhale for double that amount. If it’s hard to 
make it to the doubled number, make your breath a little slower and 
steadier on the exhale. Ideally, you want the exhalation to be the same 
intensity from the beginning until the end.
●
●Doubling the exhalation helps evoke the relaxation response. This 
helps improve heart rate variability. Keep breathing and feeling the 
whole sensation of the body as the breath moves in and out.
The Energizing Breath 
●
●This class’s next breath is an energizing breath practice, which can be 
useful just after waking or when you need an afternoon boost. The 
energizing breath is also good for releasing tension.
●
●This breath is a forceful exhalation. The inhalation happens naturally 
on its own. You can put your finger under your nose to see how it 
feels at first. Exhale strongly, but keep the inhalation natural. Do 30 
repetitions of this, with roughly one per second.
●
●After that, take three deep breaths, and then hold the breath for 30 
seconds. While you’re holding the breath, focus your attention either 
on your heart center or on the space between your eyebrows. While 
you’re doing that, you can silently affirm a word or a phrase that’s 
important to you. If you can’t hold your breath for 30 seconds or don’t 
feel comfortable doing it, feel free to replace that element with the 
deep three-part breaths introduced earlier.

Class 18 | Practice 2: De-stressing with Your Breath  |  141
Alternate Nostril Breathing
●
●This class’s next breath is called alternate nostril breathing. For this, 
you will use your thumb and your pointer finger. The thumb will be 
used to block the right nostril, and the pointer finger will be used to 
block the left nostril. 
●
●This exercise involves breathing in through one side of the body, 
holding the breath, and exhaling out of the other side. When you 
do this, you are moving from the left to the right hemisphere of 
your brain. This can help process emotions, thoughts, and other 
experiences that you are having. It’s also very good for stimulating 
different aspects of neuroplasticity.
●
●If you don’t want to hold your breath for any reason at any time, you can 
simply keep breathing from one side to the other. This exercise calls for 
you to inhale for four seconds, hold the breath, and then exhale for eight 
seconds. If a different pace works better for you, feel free to use that pace.

142  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●To start, get your fingers ready. Inhale deeply through both nostrils, 
and then exhale completely through both nostrils. Gently block the 
right nostril with your thumb, and then inhale through the left nostril 
for four seconds. Hold your nose, blocking both nostrils. While you’re 
holding the breath, relax the body, focusing on either the heart or the 
space between the eyebrows.
●
●Lift your thumb and exhale for eight seconds, trying to make that 
exhalation the same intensity throughout. Inhale for four seconds through 
the right nostril. Hold the breath, blocking both nostrils. Exhale through 
the left nostril for eight seconds, and then inhale through the left nostril. 
●
●Gently hold the breath, blocking both nostrils, and then unblock the right 
nostril and exhale through it. Inhale through the right nostril for four 
seconds. Hold the breath, again blocking both nostrils. Exhale through the 
left nostril for eight seconds. Inhale through the left nostril for four seconds. 
Hold the nose. Exhale through the right nostril for eight seconds.
●
●Then, inhale through the right nostril for four seconds. Exhale and 
then hold the breath, blocking both nostrils. Exhale through the left 
nostril for eight seconds. 
●
●Next, you can place your hand down on your knee. Keep your eyes 
closed and notice how your body and mind feel after practicing that 
breath. This is a great breath to do if you ever feel yourself feeling tense 
or anxious. It’s a breath designed to bring balance to your body and 
your mind.
Meditation Preparation Breath
●
●This class’s final breath can serve as preparation for meditation. Find 
a position that is comfortable. A typical meditation hand position is 
to bring your left hand palm up and your right hand on top of it with 
the thumbs touching. Then, straighten the spine. 

Class 18 | Practice 2: De-stressing with Your Breath  |  143
●
●Picture the whole spinal column as straight. Imagine there is an elevator 
that goes up from the tip of your tailbone, up through your whole spine, 
and then out through the crown of your head. On the exhalation, that 
elevator goes down through the spine, through the whole body, and out 
through the tailbone. When inhaling, breathe up through the whole 
spine, connecting with the space above. Then, exhale down through the 
whole body. This should be performed with your eyes closed.
●
●Keep breathing like this, with long, steady breaths at your own pace. The 
mind will start to wander, so keep bringing it back to the visualization and 
the breath. Notice the sensation of your physical body as the breath moves 
up and down through the spinal column, calming and soothing your whole 
nervous system, signaling to your body that it has permission to relax.
●
●At some point, it may feel like your body doesn’t want to take deep 
breaths anymore, and then the breath can start to become subtler. It is 
still rhythmic and deep, but somewhat lighter. For the next couple of 
minutes, let your body find its natural rhythmic breathing rate, where 
it is steady and constant but also peaceful and relaxed. 
●
●If you would like to continue on with a silent meditation, focus either 
on your heart center or the space between your eyebrows. Continue 
silently affirming to yourself a word or phrase such as, “I am healthy, 
whole, and complete just as I am. I am here.” Alternatively, you can 
repeat a word such as trust, forgive, love, or truth. 
●
●Another option is to let your mind relax completely and rest in the 
stillness. You will notice physical sensations and changing thoughts, 
all on a backdrop of unchanging awareness, as well as the stillness that 
is present in every moment.

Class 19
Practice 3: 
Promoting Sleep
T
his is the sleep practice class, which you can think of as a way to prepare 
yourself for bed. During the first time you practice, you may want to 
watch the video, as an actor demonstrates the initial opening experiences. 
After that, you might listen to it as an audio practice, where you put it on in the 
background and let it guide you into a deep night’s rest. This guidebook chapter 
provides an overview of the steps in the sleep-preparation routine.
Starting Out
●
●Begin by lying down. Have your blankets ready if you want to cover 
yourself up after the initial stretches. Find a comfortable, reclined 
position, and for a few moments, close the eyes and start to think 
about your day. Are there certain events that stand out to you from 
your day? 

Class 19 | Practice 3: Promoting Sleep  |  145
●
●Take a moment and think of something that might have felt 
challenging for you—perhaps something you said you wished you 
hadn’t. Take a moment to consider how you would do it differently if 
it happened again. 
●
●Next, bring to mind something great that happened today. If you can’t 
think of anything great, then just think of something that went pretty 
well. Notice how your body feels as you consider positive events.
●
●Now, think of your day as a whole. Consider all the things that 
happened and notice what the body feels like as you start to settle. As 
you do this, draw your knees in toward your chest and give yourself a 
hug. Take a moment, curled in a ball. 
Giving Thanks
●
●Next, if you’d like, you can put your head down, but leave your 
arms wrapped around your legs. Take a moment to give thanks for 

146  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
your body. Think about all the things your body did today and feel 
gratitude toward it. 
●
●Also give thanks to your mind. Even if there are a few things that 
don’t seem quite right, there are actually in every moment billions of 
things happening right in your body and in your mind. Give thanks 
for those. 
●
●Take a moment to offer any additional gratitude for whatever may 
have occurred today and for the people who make your life possible: 
your family, your friends, and your colleagues. Think of everyone who 
touches your day in some way. You might also express gratitude for 
your home, for nature, or your community.
Stretching
●
●When you’re ready, stretch your legs out in front of you. Extend the 
arms above the head and give your body a long, full stretch. Take a 

Class 19 | Practice 3: Promoting Sleep  |  147
couple of deep breaths, inhaling from the soles of the feet up through 
the whole body and out through the hands. As you exhale, breathe 
down through the body, out through the soles of the feet. 
●
●Next, interlace your fingers and press your palms away from you. Flex 
your feet, pulling your toes back toward the body. Give the back of 
your body a long stretch, breathing in and out. On the exhalation, 
sweep the breath down through the whole body. 
●
●Release your legs down, letting them find a comfortable resting 
position. If there’s any tension in the lower back, you may want a 
bolster beneath your knees.
●
●For one last stretch, take your hands behind your head and interlace 
the fingers behind the head. You can gently pull the chin up toward 
the chest and turn the head to the right and the left, releasing any 
lingering tension in the neck. Then, place your head gently down on 
the pillow.
Tension and Relaxation Exercises
●
●Next up are the tension and relaxation exercises. Start by lifting up 
your right leg and squeezing your foot, calf, knee, ankle, thigh, and 
hamstring. Gather all the tension and then let the leg drop, just like 
a lead brick. After that, do the same with your left leg. Feel both of 
your legs. Notice the sensation: After you tense something, it tends to 
relax even more.
●
●Now, inhale, lift up both your legs, and tense your feet, ankles, calves, 
knees, and thighs. Tense everything in your legs and then drop. Next, lift 
up your hips and tense your buttocks and lower abdomen. Then, move to 
the lower back, tensing it and then relaxing. Drop the hips down. 
●
●Tense your chest and lift your shoulders up toward your ears, 
gathering any tension in the chest and shoulders, and then releasing. 
Next, feel both of your arms. 

148  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Bring the right arm into awareness. Lift the right arm up and make 
a fist with your right hand, tensing your hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, 
and upper arm. Gather all the tension that may have accumulated and 
then drop the arm down. Notice the difference between the right arm 
and left arm, and then repeat the lifting, tensing, and releasing with 
your left arm.
●
●After that, squeeze your face into a prune. Gather any tension in the 
face and then release. Next, extend the body, stretching out your arms 
and legs. Notice if there are any adjustments you’d like to make to 
your body. If you’d like to cover up with a blanket, this would be a 
good time to do so, letting the body start to find the position that you 
like to sleep in.  
●
●Take a few moments to see if there’s anything you could do to be more 
comfortable, and make those adjustments. If there’s any lingering 
tension in the neck, you can turn the head a little to the right and the 
left, letting it settle eventually in the middle of the pillow. If you’re a 
side sleeper, feel free to do the rest of the practice on your side.
Ferris Wheel Breath
●
●Now comes a breathing practice called the Ferris wheel breath. To 
begin the Ferris wheel breath, envision the entire spinal column from 
the tip of the tailbone all the way up to the crown of the head. Now 
picture a long, narrow Ferris wheel that runs up the spine and then 
down the back of the spine. 
●
●Picture yourself getting on the Ferris wheel at the base of your spine, 
at your tailbone. On the inhalation, breathe up the Ferris wheel to the 
crown of your head. Notice the moment of transition at the top of the 
head, where the inhalation turns into an exhalation, and then breathe 
down the backside of the spine to your tailbone.
●
●Notice the moment of transition at the bottom, where the exhalation 
becomes an inhalation, and then breathe up the front side of the spine 

Class 19 | Practice 3: Promoting Sleep  |  149
to the crown of the head. Again, notice the moment of transition at 
the top, where inhalation becomes exhalation, and then breathe down 
the backside of the spine to the top of the tailbone. 
●
●Once more, notice the moment of transition from exhalation to 
inhalation. Continue on with the Ferris wheel breath, finding that 
deep, rhythmic breathing that nurtures and calms the body.
Guided Meditation
●
●At this point, the class transitions into a Yoga Nidra guided meditation 
practice. Take a moment to see if there are any additional adjustments 
you want to make in preparation for that practice. Then, refer to the 
audio or video lesson for guidance through the practice.

Class 20
Practice 4: Relaxing 
Yoga for Self-Care
T
his class focuses on yoga practice for self-care. The video class 
demonstrates these poses in chair and floor variations, and this 
guidebook chapter provides a summary of the activities. 
If a pose or movement does not feel right to you, modify it so that it feels 
good or skip it. It is also a good idea to check with your doctor if you have any 
questions about if these practices are suitable for your body.
Breathing Practice
●
●This class begins with a breathing practice that also uses the arms and 
incorporates a gratitude element. Begin with your arms out to the 
sides. On a deep inhalation, extend your arms out to the sides and 
lift up, bringing your arms up over your head and into the prayer 
position. On an exhalation, draw your hands down toward the heart.

Class 20 | Practice 4: Relaxing Yoga for Self-Care  |  151
●
●Connect with your heart. Inhale and extend the arms up into the air, 
and when you exhale, extend the hands out and down. Take several 
more breaths. On each inhalation, think about whatever it is your body 
and mind need. On each exhalation, exhale, thinking of gratitude for 
all the blessings in life. Once finished, relax your arms toward your sides 
and find a comfortable resting position for your hands.
Neck Stretching
●
●The next part of this practice involves neck rotations to help release 
the tension in your neck. If you have any neck issues, don’t bring your 
head backward when doing the neck rotation. Instead, keep it in a 
neutral position. If you have a healthy neck, feel free to slightly relax 
it backward. 
●
●To start out, bring your chin down toward your chest and begin rolling 
the head to the right. Inhale, then roll the head back and exhale. 
Repeat this at your own pace. 
Eventually, you can switch 
directions. Throughout, listen 
to your body and feel the 
breath.
●
●Next, bring the head back to 
a neutral position. Lift your 
shoulders up toward your ears, 
gathering any tension in your 
shoulders. Drop the shoulders 
down, inhale, and lift them 
up again. Again, gather any 
tension, and then drop the 
shoulders. Repeat this process 
one more time.
Neck Stretching

152  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●After that, roll your shoulders forward in big rotations before going in 
the opposite direction. Roll your shoulder blades back together and 
down behind you. Next, inhale and extend your arms over your head. 
Stretch up, feeling as if someone is lifting your arms up. 
●
●When you exhale, bring the arms down. At this stage, you can either 
interlace your hands behind you or bring them back onto a chair. Repeat 
this step a couple of times at your own pace before re-centering yourself.
Shoulder Stretching
●
●The class’s next phase is a stretch for the shoulders. There are two ways 
to do it. The more accessible version of it is to bring the hands and 
elbows together, and then lift the elbows slightly up and bring the hands 
slightly out. Notice where you feel the best stretch, and then breathe. 
●
●The other option is to swing your right arm over your left, interlace 
your hands, and lift the elbows up slightly and the hands out and 
away. Notice where you feel the best stretch, and then breathe.
Shoulder Stretching

Class 20 | Practice 4: Relaxing Yoga for Self-Care  |  153
●
●After a couple of deep breaths, release the arms and switch sides. If 
your hands were together, you can shake your arms out for a moment 
before lifting them up again. If you’re doing the other version, swing 
the left arm over the right this time. In either case, lift the elbows up 
and the hands slightly out and away. Then, consciously send breaths 
into any points of tension between the shoulder blades. When you’re 
done, release the arms and shake them out.
Cat-Cow Pose
●
●Next up is the cat-cow yoga pose. One option is to place your hands on 
your knees. Then, roll your shoulders down and gaze at your belly button. 
After that, open up, bringing the head back and arching the back.
●
●The other option is to go onto your hands and knees, with your hands 
beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. The feet 
will be about hip-distance apart. On each inhalation, lift your head 
up and arch your back, and on each exhalation, tuck your head and 
tailbone down to stretch out the spine. 
Yoga involves listening to your body and finding the union between 
the body, breath, emotions, and spirit. 
Cat-Cow Pose

154  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Rotations
●
●The class’s next phase involves rotations. To do them from a seated 
position, leave your hands on your knees, or bring them back a bit if 
that feels better. Next, make big circles with your torso. Listen to your 
body to find the rhythm.
●
●The other method is to bring your hands out about as wide as your 
mat with your knees together. Make your hips go in a large circle. 
Whichever option you are doing, at some point, you may want to 
switch directions. When finished, come to a neutral position.
●
●Next, come down onto your back on the ground. Hug your knees 
into your chest. If you’d like, you can make some circles on the base of 
your spine for a lower-back massage. While hugging your legs, close 
your eyes and give thanks for your body.
Rotations

Class 20 | Practice 4: Relaxing Yoga for Self-Care  |  155
Bridge Pose
●
●The class’s next step is preparation for the bridge pose. Place your 
feet roughly hip-distance apart. Bring your arms up over your head. 
Visualize the entire spine supported by the floor beneath you. Next, 
lift the tailbone very gently up off the mat, slowly lifting the hips up. 
●
●Once you reach the farthest position that is comfortable for you, hold 
there for a few moments. Then, slowly place your back down on the 
mat until you get to the tailbone. When you get down to the tailbone, 
tip the pelvis forward to form a small arch in your lower back. Repeat 
this at your own pace, inviting your body to relax.
Shoulder Stand
●
●After the bridge pose comes the shoulder stand. To perform a chair 
variation, wiggle yourself close to the chair and place your calves on the 
Bridge Pose

156  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
chair. To perform a variation with a block, find the height of the block 
that is comfortable for you, and then rest your sacrum on the block.
●
●Once you’re in position, feel your body relax. Next, lift the right leg 
up, taking a couple of deep breaths. Then, bring the leg down before 
bringing the other leg up and slowly down. If you’re doing the chair 
variation, leave your legs in position.
●
●If you’re doing the other variation, you can try lifting both of your 
legs up for an additional experience with the pose. Keep in mind that 
whichever variation you choose, some days, one may feel better than 
the other.
●
●When you’re done, slowly bring your legs back down. If you are using 
the block, you can remove it before lying down flat on your back. If 
Shoulder Stand

Class 20 | Practice 4: Relaxing Yoga for Self-Care  |  157
you’re working in the chair, you can now come down off the chair 
before slowly coming back into a seated position on the chair.
The Spinal Twist
●
●This class’s next move is a spinal twist. If you’re in the chair, bring your 
right arm behind your body. Find a comfortable position. Then, take 
your left hand and bring it over to the side, either on your knee or on 
the arm of the chair. Once you’re in position, gently turn your head 
and gaze toward the left. 
●
●If you’re lying on the ground, bring your leg up, place it just below the 
knee, and then extend your leg out to the side as your head turns and 
gazes toward the other side. Once you’re in position, take some long, 
deep breaths up and down the spinal column. Next, slowly come to 
the center. 
●
●Switch sides and repeat the process. Once finished, re-center yourself. 
If you’re lying down, extend the leg out in front of you.
The Spinal Twist

158  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Tension and Relaxation
●
●The next phase focuses on tension and relaxation, and the steps are the 
same whether in a chair or lying down. To begin, notice the body, and 
then take three deep breaths. Inhale fully before exhaling completely. 
●
●After that, inhale again, lifting your arms and legs up. Tense your feet, 
calves, knees, thighs, hips, pelvis, lower back, abdomen, upper back, 
chest, arms, and hands. Make your face like a prune. Hold everything 
and drop. Next, extend out your arms and legs, and stretch your body 
for a moment in whatever way feels good.
The Final Relaxation Pose
●
●This class concludes with a final relaxation pose and a breathing 
exercise that will accompany that. Place your right hand on your 
abdomen and your left hand on your chest. Take five very conscious 
deep breaths. On each inhalation, think of whatever it is you need—
perhaps relaxation, patience, or compassion. Breathe it in. 
●
●As you exhale, breathe out anything that is no longer serving you—
perhaps an old idea, relationship, or object. Keep breathing at your 
own pace, inhaling what you need and exhaling what you don’t need.
●
●When you finish up, you can relax your arms by your sides and sit for 
a couple of minutes. Feel the whole plane of contact between the body 
and the surface beneath you. Observe the sensation of your physical 
body, welcoming yourself just as you are. 

Class 21
Practice 5: 
Practicing 
Mindfulness
T
his practice class focuses on mindfulness, which is all about paying 
attention on purpose. This guidebook chapter is a companion to 
the video or audio class, which you’ll need to watch or listen to for 
the full experience. The chapter includes tips to prepare for the practice and 
considerations to be aware of as you complete the video or audio class.
Preparing for the Practice
●
●This class’s mindfulness practice lasts about half an hour. You may 
want to take a few moments to gather up any creature comforts, such 
as a blanket, pillow, or a bolster for beneath your knees. Go ahead and 
start to get comfortable. 
●
●During the practice, the instructor will guide you through different 
experiences. You may be very alert and aware of everything that’s 

160  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
happening, or you might be in a space between asleep and awake, 
where you hear the sound of the instructor’s voice without necessarily 
holding onto everything she says. 
●
●Regardless of your experience, it is perfect, even if you fall asleep. Take 
this class as an invitation to rest and be present, welcoming yourself 
just as you are.
During the Practice
●
●From time to time, the instructor will prompt you to be aware of all 
five of your senses: taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound. The instructor 
will also prompt you to pay attention to sensations in different parts 
of your body, such as your chest and abdomen. They all play a role in 
receiving your experience of the present moment.
●
●You will also be prompted to notice any thoughts, feelings, emotions, 
or beliefs as they arise, unfold, and dissolve in your mind. This will 
occur once at the start of the practice and again near the end. Another 
section of the practice involves picturing yourself in another place and 
time, and paying attention to the sensations that brings.
●
●One section of the practice involves a specific breathing direction. 
You’ll begin by feeling the left side of your body breathing in on an 
inhalation, and then breathing out through the right side of your 
body. You will breathe like this for a time before switching sides and 
directions. The mind may begin to wander during this stage, and if it 
does, simply refocus it on your breathing.
●
●Over time, the practice builds toward a state of awareness and stillness. 
Eventually, near the end, the instructor will ask you to welcome a 
deeper breath into the chest, feeling the way deep breathing brings life 
and vitality to your body and your mind.
●
●You’re welcome to remain in this ending state for as long as you’d like. 
If you feel ready to return to the waking state, you can start to let 

Class 21 | Practice 5: Practicing Mindfulness  |  161
organic movements occur, perhaps wiggling a finger or toe. Then, feel 
the stillness once more, and see if your thoughts, words, and deeds can 
arise as a reflection of the stillness.

Class 22
Practice 6: Evoking 
the Relaxation 
Response
T
his class’s practices are oriented toward triggering your parasympathetic 
nervous system by using the relaxation response. This is an essential 
piece of being a resilient person. The video lesson demonstrates different 
versions of the poses involved, and this guidebook chapter is a summary of 
those movements. If a particular movement doesn’t feel right for you, find a 
version that does feel good or skip the activity.
Starting Out
●
●This class begins with a breathing practice. Begin in a comfortable seated 
position, either on the floor or in a chair. Make your spine straight. You 
can start by putting your right hand on your belly and your left hand on 
your chest. Inhale for four seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. 
Feel free to change the timing to make it feel better, but make sure your 

Class 22 | Practice 6: Evoking the Relaxation Response  |  163
exhalations are twice as long as your inhalations. Repeat this several 
times at your own pace, keeping your mind focused on the breath.
●
●Next comes alternate nostril breathing, which is an excellent practice 
for alleviating anxiety or integrating challenging emotions. This class’s 
variation is different from the one in the practice class on breathing. 
●
●You will use your thumb and pointer finger. Take a deep inhalation 
through both nostrils, and then block your right nostril with your 
thumb. Inhale for four seconds, block both nostrils, and then lift the 
thumb and exhale through the right nostril for eight seconds. Repeat 
this process, alternating nostrils, for several repetitions.
Preparation for Physical Movements
●
●After that comes preparation for the physical movements. Bring your 
left arm out to the side and bring your right ear down toward your 
right shoulder. Here, you will begin stretching the neck. Extend the 
arm, moving it slightly from the front to the back. You can also bring 
your chin down if desired.
●
●While you’re moving, breathe fully into the body, directing your breath 
to any points of tension. Then, switch sides, extending your right arm 
out and bringing your left ear down toward your left shoulder. Move 
the arm, head, or the neck to find the place where you get the most 
stretch, and then consciously breathe into the body. 
●
●For the next move, if you’re sitting in a chair, you can place your left 
forearm down on the chair. Then, lift your right arm up and over 
your ear. If that’s not possible, come as far up as you can. If you’re 
doing the floor variation, you can bring your forearm down onto the 
ground, inhale, and then lift your right arm up and over your head. 
Take several long, deep breaths, feeling the sensations in your body 
and observing what is present in the pose. 

164  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Re-center and then switch over to your other side. Place your right 
forearm on the arm of the chair or on the ground, and lift your left 
arm up and over your ear. Again, take long, deep breaths, enjoying 
this opportunity to alleviate tension in the body. 
●
●Come back to center, and then place your hands on your knees. Roll 
your shoulders down and gaze down at your belly button. On an 
inhalation, lift up and arch your back. If you have a healthy neck, you 
can relax your head back. If not, keep your chin in a neutral position. 
●
●Moving at your own pace, roll the shoulders down, gazing toward 
the belly button, and then come back up while inhaling. Repeat by 
exhaling on a downward roll. When you’ve done this as much as you 
like, return to a neutral position.
Stretching the Legs and Lower Back
●
●The next step is a stretch for the backside of the legs and the lower 
back. Start by extending your left leg. If you’re in the chair, make your 
Half Lotus

Class 22 | Practice 6: Evoking the Relaxation Response  |  165
way down onto the ground. An accessible variation is to bring the foot 
to the inside of your thigh. Another option, if you’re more flexible, is 
to bring your foot into the half lotus pose. Avoid the half lotus if you 
have any knee issues.
●
●Once you’re ready, inhale and lift your arms up into the air, and then 
exhale and bring the arms out and down. Draw your fingertips up 
the leg and the side of your body, inhaling. Exhale while extending 
out and down. Keep going for one 
or two more repetitions, feeling the 
body unfold into the pose. 
●
●When you are prepared, slowly come 
back up and repeat this process, 
reversing the directions to target the 
other side of the body. Once you are 
done with this movement, you can 
stay down in a forward fold.
●
●Next, make some space around the 
points of tension in the body and 
release the body into that space. 
Consciously direct your breath to draw in calm energy and exhale 
any tension or stress. After that, inhale and stretch your body once 
more, extending your arms straight up as you bring your legs out. 
Finally, release.
Five-Pointed Star or Tortoise Pose
●
●The next part of the class has two pose options: the five-pointed star 
or the tortoise. To perform the five-pointed star pose, bring the soles 
of your feet together and relax the knees out to the side. Bring your 
feet a little farther out away from the body, and then interlace your 
fingers around the toes. You can then bring your torso and head down 
over that star, tucking the head in even to the soles of the feet. If you 
Through the practice 
of yoga, you build your 
resilience by seeing 
how the things you 
do can have an effect 
on your body. In each 
moment, you have the 
opportunity to create 
the relaxation response. 

166  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
need to, you can wiggle the feet out a little farther, finding the place 
that feels best for your body.
●
●To perform the tortoise, bring the soles of the feet together, fairly far 
out from the body, and then thread your arms beneath your thighs 
and bring your head down toward the soles of your feet. Once you’re 
in position, take some deep breaths, inviting your body to relax. 
●
●Next, take the arms out slowly, eventually extending your legs out in 
front of you. Once your legs are out in front of you, take a moment to 
give your legs a massage, which is good for releasing tension.
The Full Seated Forward Fold
●
●The next step is preparation for a full seated forward fold. Root 
yourself firmly on the mat. Then, straighten the spine. Inhale, 
extending the arms up above your head. Once again, exhale, extending 
Tortoise Pose

Class 22 | Practice 6: Evoking the Relaxation Response  |  167
out and down. Flow through 
this several more times at your 
own pace. When you are done, 
lift out of the pose slowly on an 
inhalation.
The Pigeon Pose
●
●This class now turns to two 
different 
variations 
of 
the 
pigeon pose. The first is an 
accessible version. For this 
version, bring your left foot just 
above the knee. Make sure the foot is not on the knee, as that could 
put pressure on the knee. Then, your knee will come out to the side. 
●
●If this is not an option for you, you can also place your foot on the 
ground. Otherwise, bring it up into position, and then use your elbow 
to gently push out the left knee. Keep your torso centered as you 
slowly come over the legs. 
The Full Seated Forward Fold
The Pigeon Pose

168  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●The other version is the full pigeon pose. To do this, bring your left 
shin parallel with the top of the mat, and then bring your right leg 
behind you with the toes pointed backward. Straighten the spine, and 
then walk your hands out. Stretching this pose to the max takes a lot 
of flexibility, so do whatever feels good to you. While in the pigeon 
pose, breathe deeply into the body. Then, slowly come up out of the 
pose and perform it with your other side, again breathing deeply. 
●
●When you’re ready, slowly come up and then over onto your abdomen, 
making a pillow with your hands. Put your right hand on top and 
your right cheek on that hand. Bring your big toes to touch behind 
you, and then relax your legs and wiggle your hips from side to side. 
This helps release some tension in the lower back.
The Cobra Pose
●
●This class’s next pose is the cobra pose. Bring the palms of your 
hands beneath your shoulders, fingertips in line with the edge of 
The Cobra Pose

Class 22 | Practice 6: Evoking the Relaxation Response  |  169
your shoulders. Bring the legs together behind you and your forehead 
down onto the mat. Slowly lift your forehead up off the mat. You can 
keep the elbows pinned in toward the rib cage to make the movement 
more challenging. 
●
●Once you’re in position, breathe deeply. Roll your shoulders back and 
down away from your ears. Then, slowly come up one more time, 
giving compression to the lower back. 
●
●Slowly roll down out of the pose. This time, once your head reaches 
the ground, make another pillow, using the left hand to support the 
left cheek this time. Your big toes should be touching behind you. If 
there’s any tension in the hips, you can shake them out. 
Super Person Pose
●
●The class’s next activity is the super person pose. Extend your arms 
out in front of you. When you’re ready, lift your arms and legs up off 
the ground. See how little of your body you can leave on the floor. 
Remember to breathe. 
●
●When your body has had enough, slowly roll down. Hold for a 
moment. On an inhalation, lift the body again. This time, you can 
bend your knees and swing your arms slowly out behind you. An 
Super Person Pose

170  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
option is to catch your feet or ankles with your hands, but if you can’t 
do this, just reach back in that direction.
●
●Once you’re up, lift your head up and breathe deeply. Then, slowly 
come down. Place your hands beneath your shoulders and press back 
into the child’s pose.
The Child’s Pose
●
●There are several ways you can do the child’s pose. One option is to 
do it with your knees out as wide as your mat, with your toes touching 
behind you. Extend your arms out, with your torso down between 
the knees. Another option is to do it with the knees together and the 
hands brought back by the ankles. Different bodies feel different in 
this pose, so do what feels good to you.
●
●Consciously turn your attention inward. Take some long, deep breaths, 
feeling the breath nourishing the body. Then you can start to come back 
over onto your back for the final relaxation or shavasana pose. 
The Child’s Pose

Class 22 | Practice 6: Evoking the Relaxation Response  |  171
The Shavasana Pose
●
●Once you come down, you can hug your knees in toward your chest, 
giving yourself a hug. You can make some circles to the right and the 
left. Rhythmic movements are very soothing for the body.
●
●When you’re ready, extend the legs out and notice if your body needs 
any sort of extra stretch. Do whatever makes your body feel good the 
way it is, allowing you to stay where you are. 
●
●Once you have found your position, let the legs come out about 
as wide as the mat and let the toes fall out to the sides. Lift your 
shoulders up toward your ears, then roll them back and down, placing 
the shoulder blades flat on the mat. The palms should be open, facing 
up in a receptive position. If there’s any tension in the back of your 
neck, you can inhale. When you exhale, roll the head to the right and 
then back and forth a couple of times. 
●
●Next, center your head, tucking your chin a bit into your chest. Place 
the back of your neck down on the mat. Feel all the places the body 
is supported. Now, feel as if you are breathing the breath in from the 
soles of your feet up through your legs, up through your torso, and 
through the crown of your head. On the exhalation, breathe down 
through the body and through the soles of the feet. 
●
●Take several breaths like this, feeling how the breath can move energy 
and sensation in the body. These long, full body breaths are like an 
opportunity to sweep through any tension that may have accumulated. 
When your body feels ready to rest in stillness, let the breath find its 
normal, natural rhythm. Allow yourself to relax here in shavasana, the 
final relaxation pose, for as long as you’d like.

Class 23
Practice 7: 
Finding Safety 
with Yoga Nidra
T
his practice class on Yoga Nidra invites you to go on a journey to find 
safety inside of yourself, no matter what is occurring in your outside 
world. The video lesson provides demonstrations of the movements, 
starting from a reclined position or sitting in a chair. You may also want to use a 
blanket if you are chilly, and a pillow or bolster beneath your knees so that you 
can rest throughout the practice. This guidebook chapter consists of a summary 
of the steps of the class.
Starting Out
●
●Once you’ve settled, start by feeling the body. What is the present 
moment experience of your body? What is it that you’re bringing with 
you into your practice? Feel your whole body. Notice how, as you 
continue to settle in, the body is almost like a waterfall. It should start 
to feel supported as the settling process continues to unfold. 

Class 23 | Practice 7: Finding Safety with Yoga Nidra  |  173
●
●If it’s helpful, you can take a few long, deep breaths, letting each 
breath draw you even more fully into the present moment. Observe 
what is present in your mind. 
●
●Next, allow an inner resource to arise. Find an internal space of well-
being: a place where you feel comfortable and safe. This can be a real 
place, such as a place in nature, a place from your childhood, or your 
home. It can also be a totally imaginary place. Feel this as an internal 
place, not dependent on the outside world.
●
●As you open up to this place of safety, let your five senses open up as 
well. What do you see, hear, and smell? What tastes allow you to feel 
comfort and safety? What makes your body comfortable and warm? 
Welcome any sensations that help you feel safe, calm, nourished, and 
at peace, and focus on how your body feels when you experience a 
sense of well-being.
●
●Next, set an intention for your practice. Perhaps your intention is to 
find inner peace that can hold you no matter what is occurring in 
daily life. Invite in questions: What is it that I truly want more than 
anything else in life? What is my heart’s deepest desire? 
●
●Whatever the answer is, affirm it in a sentence in the present tense, as 
if it’s already a fact. An example is this: “I am peaceful and complete 
just as I am.” This can feel like home and promote stillness. 
Attention to the Body
●
●The next phase of the class involves moving attention through the 
physical body. Whatever you experience from a given part is absolutely 
perfect. 
●
●First, feel your mouth and all of the textures and sensations within. 
Do the same for your ears, and then feel your way across your face 
to your nose. After that, feel your eyes, eyelids, forehead, and skull. 

174  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
Eventually, feel the entire head as a pure sensation, also paying 
attention to your neck and throat.
●
●Move down into the shoulders. Ask yourself: What is the sensation of 
the shoulders? Is there any tension present? If so, see if you can find 
the epicenter of tension in the shoulders. It may be where you thought 
it was, or it may disappear when you search for it.
●
●Next, feel your way down through the arms, reaching the palms of your 
hands, fingers, and thumbs. Feel your way back up the arms and into 
your chest, covering the ribs, lungs, heart, and the center of the chest.
●
●Come down to your abdomen and lower back. Notice the sensation 
of the abdomen and lower back, and how that might change as you 
move down into the hips and the pelvis. Feel your way through the 
legs, all the way down into the ankles and feet. Feel the soles of your 
feet and your toes. 
●
●Finally, feel the symphony of sensation in your whole body. See if it’s 
possible to welcome the body just as you are. Observe if a feeling of 
safety and comfort arises.
●
●You may also notice some judgments about the body, physical pain, 
or something else that doesn’t feel welcome. Notice what that feels 
like. Ask yourself: Where did they come from? What do they want 
and need to feel safe?
●
●Welcome your body and any feelings that are still present of judgment 
or doubt about the body. Gather up all the feelings and opinions you 
may have ever had, as if you’re giving them all a hug, letting them 
know it’s safe to be who you are in this moment. It’s possible to feel 
this without changing anything at all about your body.
●
●Affirm to yourself: “My body is a safe place to be. I feel healthy, whole, 
and complete just as I am.” Do this even if it doesn’t yet feel entirely 
true. Feel as if it’s in the process of becoming a reality. Alternatively, 

Class 23 | Practice 7: Finding Safety with Yoga Nidra  |  175
perhaps it is already true, and you’ve developed a willingness to accept 
that belief.
Attention to the Breath
●
●Next, bring your attention to the breath, feeling how its rhythm 
brings a sense of safety and comfort. Feel how the breath is bringing 
you balance, life, and opportunity for harmony. Each inhalation and 
exhalation provides a chance to connect more fully with yourself. 
●
●On each inhalation, feel the world becoming you. On each exhalation, 
feel a part of the whole. Notice the sense of safety that comes from 
feeling a part of the whole, where separation starts to dissolve. You have 
a body and a mind, but at the same time, you are a part of the whole. 
Feel the safety and the comfort of being part of nature and humanity. 
Attention to the Mind
●
●After that, observe the mind. Notice what safety feels like. Think of 
the sense of safety that you may have experienced at one point of 
your life or are experiencing now. Ask yourself: What is safety? What 
does that mean to me? When I think of safety, where do I feel it in 
the body?
●
●Let this experience of safety unfold. Notice if any sense of separation 
from safety starts to arise. Feel that, asking yourself: Where do I 
separate from a sense of safety? Where do I go away from that home 
ground of stillness within? How can I feel safe amidst even this? 
●
●Allow the answer to arise, knowing the body is always trying to find 
safety and harmony. Give it credit for this. Also give yourself credit for 
how every moment of life, your body has been working hard for you 
to feel safe and at home in your skin and in your mind. Commit to 
yourself to do things that will increase the chances for this peace and 
safety to be your constant experience.

176  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
●
●Whenever separation arises, invite the question: How can I come 
home to myself so that I never go away? Let yourself draw back into 
stillness, silence, and the center of your being. Come back home to 
your true nature, a place where you are always safe, resting, and feeling 
a sense of well-being and stillness. 
●
●Imagine yourself abiding in the stillness as you go about your day—
doing things at home, eating, sleeping, working, preparing a meal, 
resting, relaxing, and playing. Do this while resting in stillness, staying 
connected to the peace that is your true nature.
●
●Commit to a heartfelt intention to stay connected to the peace that 
is always present inside of you. Intend that all of your thoughts, 
words, and deeds arise as a reflection of this stillness. Know that every 
potential lives in you. Feel inspired to bring it to life in the way only 
you can.
●
●Remain here for as long as you’d like. Once you’re ready to come 
back to your day, start taking some deeper breaths or moving the 
body slightly. Take all the time you need to transition to wakefulness, 
staying connected to the stillness and embodying your true nature. 

Class 24
Your Hero’s Journey
T
his class draws the course to a close by bringing themes from throughout 
the course together. It begins by returning to the Resilience Self-
Evaluation Tool. Additionally, the video and audio lessons contain a 
guided mindfulness meditation practice based on the hero’s journey. A recap 
of the hero’s journey is provided in this guidebook chapter. This is a class you 
may come back to many times to move through the hero’s journey again as you 
uncover deeper layers of meaning present in your life.
Evaluating Your Resilience
●
●If you haven’t done so yet, use the Resilience Self-Evaluation Tool. 
This tool will measure your resilience in eight different categories. 
Even if you have already taken the evaluation, it’s a good idea to take 
it again, as some of your answers may have changed now that you’ve 
worked your way through the course. As you take the evaluation and 

178  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
look through your results, keep in mind that it’s normal to feel more 
resilient in some areas than others. 
●
●The purpose of this tool is twofold. It allows you to realize the ways 
in which you are very resilient already so that you can harness those 
skills. It also allows you to uncover areas in which resilience comes less 
naturally to you, so that you can find ways to amp up your resilience 
in those areas.
●
●Once you’re done with the evaluation, take some time to reflect on your 
results. Where are your strengths? Which areas are more difficult for 
you? Do your results surprise you? Look at each category in isolation, 
and really think about how each one has manifested in your life. 
●
●It’s helpful to do this self-evaluation in your areas of weakness as well as 
in your areas of strength. By harnessing your strengths, you could very 
well uncover some skills that you could transfer to other categories as 
well. For instance, if you have a very proactive worldview but struggle 
with equanimity, your ability to find options in the practical world 
could be applied to your emotional world, too, perhaps through 
recognizing that you also have options in how you respond to the 
uncomfortable emotions that you experience. 
Recap of the Hero’s Journey
As a reminder and as a companion to the guided meditation in the audio/video 
lesson, here is a recap of the steps of the hero’s journey:

Bringing Everything Together
●
●There are many different ways to measure resilience. Now that you’ve 
had the chance to look at your resilience from both an intellectual and 
experiential angle, take some time to continue exploring what brings 
you resilience. After all, this is your hero’s journey. 
●
●Remember, no two people are the same, meaning you are your own 
benchmark. Some people might feel resilient because they leveraged 
their difficulties to reach their top performance, whereas others might 
feel resilient because they survived an incredible hardship.
●
●Others may define their resilience by how they have been able to draw 
strength from their challenges in order to achieve their life’s mission. 
Still others may measure their resilience by how they respond the 
next time they find themselves in a truly challenging situation. Just as 
you change over time, it’s normal for your definition of resilience to 
change over time, too. 
●
●Resilience is something that everyone already has. You have already 
made it through 100 percent of your hardest days, and that in itself 
shows resilience. It’s not a question of whether you have resilience, but 
rather a question of how you use it. 
●
●Every moment provides the opportunity to practice and increase your 
resilience, including how you respond to stress, how you perceive 
adversity, and how you care for yourself during the good times so that 
you’re ready when things get hard. These everyday choices determine 
how well you are able to withstand difficulties, bounce back from 
adversity, and learn from each and every experience.  
●
●Ultimately, resilience comes down to what you choose to give your 
personal power to. You will have challenges, and you will have 
people who disappoint or hurt you. It’s healthy to acknowledge those 
experiences and how they impact you, but you don’t have to give them 
your power. Instead, you can gain power, wisdom, and insight from 
the experiences.  

Class 24 | Your Hero’s Journey  |  181
●
●Your problems are your path.  No matter what you’ve experienced, 
nothing can take away your power to choose how you respond to the 
changing circumstances of life. This reality is the true heart of resilience.

Description of Resilience Categories
Core Values and Purpose: Having an overarching purpose that guides you in 
life, and that is supported by core values that are meaningful to you. Having 
determination and sticking to your life purpose and core values, even when 
times get rough.
Equanimity: Welcoming your entire experience—the good and the bad. 
Accepting and allowing yourself to feel all emotions, including uncomfortable 
ones like fear and sadness. Regulating your emotions. Maintaining a healthy 
connection between body and mind.
Healthy Coping Skills: Having a set of healthy coping skills (such as exercise, 
humor, and deep breathing) and avoiding unhealthy coping mechanisms (such as 
smoking, drinking, drug use, gambling, and unhealthy sex habits). Recognizing 
when you are stressed and using healthy coping skills quickly in response to stress. 
Maintaining a sense of hope, faith, and/or optimism in your life. 
Self-Care: Maintaining your energy reserves by regularly taking care of your 
physical, emotional, and mental needs. Whereas coping skills involve taking 
care of yourself in response to stress, self-care is routinely taking care of your 
needs in order to buffer you from life’s challenges. 
Positive Sense of Self: Recognizing your inherent worth as a person, but also 
not seeing yourself as better than others. Having self-compassion, trusting 
your ability to accomplish tasks and reach your goals, and feeling the desire to 
celebrate others’ successes as opposed to feeling jealous or envious of them. 
Support and Connection with Others: Knowing you have people you can 
reach out to for support (such as friends, family, and professionals), and reaching 
out to them when you need help. Having people in your life whom you can 
trust and engaging in altruistic behaviors (such as volunteer work, giving time 
to friends/family/strangers in need, and donating to good causes). 
Proactive Worldview: Having psychological flexibility, easily adapting to 
change, feeling like you have options, seeing failure as an opportunity for 

194  |  BUILDING YOUR RESILIENCE: FINDING MEANING IN ADVERSITY
growth rather than as an inherent flaw in yourself, having gratitude, and being 
able to see beyond your own perspective. 
Finding Meaning in Adversity: Believing that challenges can make you 
stronger, finding wisdom in life’s challenges, proactively seeking to find meaning 
in adversity, and taking the time to heal from past hardship and trauma. 
Questions for Reflection
After completing the self-evaluation, answer the following questions for each 
resilience category: 
●
●Does this category play a role in your life?
●
●If so, how has it been helpful?
●
●If not, what is standing in the way? For example, consider how this 
category was modeled for you during your upbringing, or what beliefs 
you have about it, such as the thought that self-care is self indulgent 
or that showing emotions is weak. 
●
●What are your strengths in this category?
●
●What are your weaknesses in this category?
●
●Where on the wheel do your protective factors come into play? Your 
protective factors are things like family support, wealth, religion, a 
well-paying job, or having an education.
●
●Where on the wheel do you find vulnerabilities or triggers? This 
could be a tendency to use unhealthy coping mechanisms, difficulty 
regulating your emotions, or an unprocessed past. 
●
●Find a takeaway. What is something you’re doing in terms of this 
category that has helped support your resilience, and what can you 

Resilience Self-Evaluation Tool  |  195
do to maintain that? Alternatively, what is something in terms of this 
category that has not supported your resilience, and what can you do 
to change that?
