Abstract
We report on work in progress concerning the investigation of a semantics of proofs for the positive fragment
of intuitionistic two-sequent K. We propose a semantics that is given in terms of simple ﬁbrations and argue
that the syntactic model construction yields an instance of it. The semantics provides means to characterize
the 2-modality as the right adjoint of the substitution functor induced by a projection in the base category.

Introduction
Finding a good proof theory for intuitionistic modal logics has a long history and var-
ious proposals are suggested in the literature. Particular attention deserves Martini
and Masini’s proposal given in [4]. It provides a two-dimensional natural deduction
system that allows one to express the modal rules as introduction and elimination
rules. An analogous proposal for intuitionistic K can be found in the Fitch-style
natural deduction system outlined in [1]. It corresponds to a one-dimensional rep-
resentation of two-sequent K that employs stacks of context instead of the indexing
used by Martini and Masini.
We propose a categorical semantics for the positive fragment of intuitionistic
two-sequent K. It is given in terms of ﬁbred category theory and is closely related
to models of simple type theory or, equivalently, intuitionistic propositional logic.
The investigation of a semantics of proofs for two-sequent K is motivated by the ob-
servation that two-sequent modal logic seems ﬁne-grained enough to express other
approaches to intuitionistic modal logic in terms of it, thus providing a sort of uni-
fying framework. Furthermore, the proposed semantics allows one to characterize
the modal rules as arising from an adjoint situation, thus satisfying the well-known
1 I would like to thank Gianluigi Bellin for his suggestion to look for a categorical semantics of Martini and
Masini’s two-sequent approach to intuitionistic modal logic and for providing me with the opportunity to
present the ideas developed in this note at a seminar at the University of Verona.

criteria according to which logical connectives should be expressed in terms of ad-
junctions. This note is organized as follows: section 2 provides a concise overview of
intuitionistic two-sequent K; section 3 deals with the categorical structure induced
by the so-called syntactic model construction.

Two-sequent K
We work with the positive fragment of intuitionistic two-sequent K, i.e formulae or
types A are deﬁned by the grammar A ::= p | ⊤| A ∧A | A →A | 2A. The rules of
the system are provided in table 1 where types have been annotated with terms t
deﬁned by the grammar t ::= x | ∗| λx.t | tt | ⟨t, t⟩| πi(t) | box(t) | unbox(t). As usual
in such presentations Γ stands for a context, i.e. a multiset x1: A1, . . . , xn: An of
typed variables. The main feature of the system is that sequents S | Γ ⊢t: A also
depend on a stack S of contexts.
Stacks of contexts are deﬁned by the grammar S ::= () | S 2 Γ where () stands
for the empty stack and 2 for the separator between the elements of the stack. For
a nonempty stack we shall omit the leading empty stack when writing out the stack
in full. Hence Γ may stand both for a multiset of typed variables and for a stack of
length 1. |S|, the number of elements in a stack S, is deﬁned inductively as follows:
|()| = 0 and |S 2 Γ| = |S| + 1.
Our presentation of the rules is inspired by the Fitch-style natural deduction
system outlined in [1], the main diﬀerence being that we use stacks to emulate the
arbitrary number of so-called stoups in the lefthand side of the sequent, and it diﬀers
slightly from the one given in [4]. Indeed, since it would be to cumbersome to write
out two-sequents such as
Γ1
ϵ
Γ2
ϵ
...
⊢
...
Γn
ϵ
Γ
t: A
in full all the time one uses a one-dimensional representation of it instead. Whereas
Martini and Masini use indexed types and terms to distinguish the diﬀerent levels
of the two-sequent under consideration we do so by using a stack. Our Fitch-style
representation Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn | Γ ⊢t: A of the above two-sequent can simply be re-
garded as the sequent (Γ1)1, . . . , (Γn)n, (Γ)n+1 ⊢tn+1: An+1 in their one-dimensional
representation where the function (−)i maps a multiset x1: A1, . . . , xn: An into the
multiset xi
1: Ai
1, . . . , xi
n: Ai
n.
It is worth mentioning that the position of a context in the stack plays a crucial
role, since there is a close connection with the nesting of 2-modalities. This can
be best explained by considering the informal interpretation of a two-sequent as
a modal formula: for instance, the above two-sequent is interpreted as the modal
formula V Γ1 →2(V Γ2 →· · · 2(V Γn →2(V Γ →A)) · · ·). Therefore, the posi-
tion of a context in the stack is in one-to-one correspondence with the number of

modalities that preﬁx its interpretation as a conjunction of formulae. It is for this
reason that the substitution rules have following form.
Lemma 2.1 The substitution rules
S | Γ ⊢s: A′
S | Γ, x: A′ ⊢t: A
sub
S | Γ ⊢t[s/x]: A
and
S | Γ′ ⊢s: A′
S′[Γ′, x: A′] | Γ ⊢t: A
sub
S′[Γ′] | Γ ⊢t[s/x]: A
where in the latter case S′[Γ] is shorthand for S 2 Γ 2 Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn, are admissible
in natural deduction.
Proof. By simultaneous induction on the length of the derivation of the right
premise. The following cases are the most interesting ones. If the derivation ends
with an instance
π
S′ | Γ′ ⊢t: 2A
S′ 2 Γ′ | Γ, x: A′ ⊢unbox(t): A
of 2 E then we can simply eliminate the substitution. Further, if the derivation ends
with an instance
π
S 2 (Γ, x: A′) | ∅⊢t: A
S | Γ, x: A′ ⊢box(t): 2A
of 2 I then we switch from the former variant of substitution to the latter.

That we have two instances of the substitution rule follows from the fact that

Reductions and expansions
we distinguish between the stack S and and the current context Γ in a sequent; we
could avoid this by writing sequents as S2Γ ⊢t: A but refrain from doing so in order
to get a tighter correspondence with the categorical semantics. Since a substitution
applies only when the stack of the sequent in the left premise matches with the one
of the sequent in the right premise as shown in the statement of the previous lemma,
we have to prove that weakening is admissible. We have to consider the following
two cases: weakening of contexts is tackled in lemma 2.2 below; weakening of stacks
in lemma 2.3 below. It is worth mentioning that weakening of stacks corresponds to
the lifting of indexes used in the proof of lemma 3.2 of [4]. For a concise statement
of the latter result we shall use the following notational convention: given a stack
S = Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn, we say that S′ ⊆S if and only if there exists m ≥0 such that
S′ = Γ′
1 2 · · · 2 Γ′
m 2 Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn.
Lemma 2.2 Given Γ ⊆Γ′,
(i) if S | Γ ⊢t: A is derivable then so is S | Γ′ ⊢t: A;
(ii) if S[Γ] | Γ′′ ⊢t: A is derivable then so is S[Γ′] | Γ′′ ⊢t: A.
Proof. By induction on the length of the derivation.

Lemma 2.3 Given S′ ⊆S, if S | Γ ⊢t: A is derivable then so is S′ | Γ ⊢t: A.
Proof. By induction on the length of the derivation.

We conclude this section with a brief remark about the computational inter-
pretation of the system. As usual, one is interested in relating certain derivations
to each other via so-called reductions and expansions: the β-reductions and η-
expansions for the positive fragment of two-sequent K are summarized in table 2.
Note that the β-reductions are simply the ones provided in [4]. With respect to the
η-expansions it is worth mentioning that each of them applies only if the term t is
of the appropriate type: for instance, the expansion t ; box(unbox(t)) applies only
if the type of t is of the form 2A.

Simple ﬁbrations
The semantics we propose is based on the concept of simple ﬁbration provided in
section 1.3 of [2]. Given a category B with ﬁnite products ×, let s(B) denote the
category having:
4

Two-sequent K and simple fribrations
objects
pairs (I, X) of objects of B;
morphisms
(I1, X1) −→(I2, X2) are pairs (u: I1 −→I2, f: I1 × X1 −→X2) of
morphisms in B.
The functor sB: s(B) −→B given by (I, X) 7→I and (u, f) 7→u is then called
the simple ﬁbration on B. We argue that a categorical semantics for the positive
fragment of intuitionistic two-sequent K consists of a simple ﬁbration that satisﬁes
the following properties:
(i) the ﬁbres s(B)I over I are cartesian closed categories;
(ii) the substitution functor induced by the left projection π1 has a right adjoint.
The aim of this section is to show that the syntactic model construction yields
such a simple ﬁbration. Making the assumption that we have a category C with
objects given by formulae A, we show that stacks of objects of C yield a category
Stacks(C) with ﬁnite products . Since objects of C can be seen as stacks that
contain exactly one element, we have that sequents Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn | Γ ⊢t: A can be
seen as morphisms t: (V Γ1 2 · · · 2 V Γn)  V Γ −→A of Stacks(C), thus giving
rise to the second morphism in the pair (u, f) of morphisms from the deﬁnition of
s(B) provided above.
Deﬁnition 3.1 Given a category C, Stacks(C) denotes the category having:
objects
stacks of objects A of C, i.e. S ::= () | S 2 A;
morphisms
S1 −→S2 are compositions of the three basic morphisms
1S: S −→S
pushA
S: S −→(S 2 A)
popA
S: (S 2 A) −→S
satisfying the two kinds of structural properties listed below.
inverse
identity
pushA
S; popX
S = 1S
1S2A; popA
S = popA
S = popA
S; 1S
popA
S; pushA
S = 1S2A
1S; pushA
S = pushA
S = pushA
S; 1S2A
Note that, since associativity of composition is trivial, the equations on the
righthand side of the above table guarantee that Stacks(C) is indeed a category.
The equations on the lefthand side state that push and pop are inverse to each
other and, furthermore, they guarantee that each composition of basic morphisms
is equivalent to one that uses a minimum number of push and pop operations, thus
making Stacks(C) become a discrete category. As a consequence thereof we can
easily prove the following result.
Lemma 3.2 The category Stacks(C) has ﬁnite products.
Proof. First we note that Stacks(C) has a terminal object, namely the empty stack
(). The unique morphism from S to () consists of |S| consecutive pop operations.
Given stacks Si = Ai1 2 · · · 2 Aiki (i ∈{1, 2}), we deﬁne their concatenation  as
follows:
S1  S2 =def A11 2 · · · 2 A1k1 2 A21 2 · · · 2 A2k2
5

Two-sequent K and simple fribrations
Binary products are given by concatenation of two stacks; left and right projections
(π1: S1  S2 −→S1 and π2: S1  S2 −→S2) can be deﬁned as compositions of
pop and/or push operations in a straightforward way.
2
Deﬁnition 3.3 Given a category C, st(C) denotes the category having:
objects
pairs (S, A) of objects of Stacks(C);
morphisms
(S1, A1) −→(S2, A2) are pairs (u: S1 −→S2, f: S1  A1 −→A2)
of morphisms in Stacks(C).
Note that st(C) is equivalent to s(Stacks(C)). Hence, we have shown that the
syntactic model construction yields the simple ﬁbration given by the projection
functor s(Stacks(C)) −→Stacks(C). However, it remains to show that this ﬁbra-
tion also satisﬁes the properties mentioned at the beginning of the section. With
respect to the ﬁrst property we have that a close examination of the rules provided
in table 1 and of the reductions and expansions provided in table 2 immediately
reveals that the ﬁbres st(C)S over S are cartesian closed. The argument for the
second property is more involved.
In contrast to the rules of the 2-free fragment the 2-rules do not induce speciﬁc
structure in the ﬁbres, but provide means to relate the ﬁbres to each other. Indeed,
we have that
Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn 2 Γ | ∅⊢t: A
=====================
Γ1 2 · · · 2 Γn | Γ ⊢t′: 2A
i.e.
that the sequent in the premise is derivable if and only the sequent in the
conclusion is. That t 7→box(t) and t′ 7→unbox(t′) are inverses of each other follows
immediately from the lowermost β-reduction and η-expansion provided in table 2.
Therefore, the introduction of the 2-modality is in bijective correspondence with
the application of a pop operation. If we use S as shorthand for V Γ1 2 · · · 2 V Γn
and A′ as shorthand for V Γ then we can deﬁne the two functors π∗
1 and Π(S,A′) as
follows:
π∗
1: st(C)S −→st(C)S A′
Π(S,A′):
st(C)S A′
−→
st(C)S
(S, A)
7→(S  A′, ⊤)
(S  A′, A)
7→
(S, 2A)
(S, A1)
(S  A′, ⊤)
(S  A′, A1)
(S, 2A1)
↓
7→
↓
↓
7→
↓
(S, A2)
(S  A′, ⊤)
(S  A′, A2)
(S, 2A2)
From a ﬁbred category theory perspective we have that the substitution functor
π∗
1: st(C)S −→st(C)S A′ induced by the left projection π1: S  A′ −→S has a
right adjoint Π(S,A′): st(C)S A′ −→st(C)S, i.e. we obtain the following bijective
correspondence:
[ π∗
1(S, A′) = ] (S  A′, ⊤) −→(S  A′, A)
(S, A′) −→(S, 2A)) [ = Π(S,A′)(S  A′, A) ]

Conclusion
Starting from a Fitch-style presentation of two-sequent K we have worked out the
categorical structure induced by the so-called syntactic model construction, thus
providing part of the proof of a completeness theorem. We have not investigated
soundness but plan to do so in future research. One of the reasons for this om-
mission is that a more direct semantics might be obtained by switching to indexed
categories and developing a categorical semantics along the lines of [3] where an
S4-like modality has been taken into consideration as well.
This line of attack
would not only provide means to tackle other modal logics but it would also pave
the ground for a comparison with [5] where we have proposed a semantics for a
parameterized variant of relevant K with a ﬂat modality, i.e. without iterations of
2, in terms of indexed categories.
Besides these issue we would also like to compare our semantics with the one
provided in [1]. Our one-dimensional representation of two-sequents is inspired by
their Fitch-style natural deduction system and thus our semantics can be regarded
as a direct semantics for it.
However, this does not explain how the semantics
proposed in this note relates to the one given in terms of a monoidal functor on a
cartesian closed category. We believe that a good starting point for the investigation
of this issue is provided by the observation that the modal rule investigated in [1]
can be regarded as a derived rule of two-sequent K. Indeed, the following simple
instance of the rule
Γ ⊢s: 2A′
x: A′ ⊢t: A
Γ ⊢box t with s for x: 2A
can be expressed as:
() | Γ ⊢s: 2A′
2 E
Γ | ∅⊢unbox(s): A′
() | x: A′ ⊢t: A
(2.3)
Γ | x: A′ ⊢t: A
sub
Γ | ∅⊢t[unbox(s)/x]: A
2 I
() | Γ ⊢box(t[unbox(s)/x]): 2A
Note that if Γ = x′: 2A′ and s = x′ then the above derived rule yields a derivation of
() | x′: 2A′ ⊢box(t[unbox(x′)/x]): 2A from a derivation of () | x′: A′ ⊢t: A. Further-
more, there exists a term t such that () | x: 2(A1 →A2) ⊢t: 2A1 →2A2 is derivable
in two-sequent K (see for instance [4]). Thus we get a monoidal endofunctor on the
ﬁbre over the empty stack ().
