PROLOGUE 
The night before he went to London, Richard Mayhew was not enjoying himself. 
He had begun the evening by enjoying himself: he had enjoyed reading the good-
bye cards, and receiving the hugs from several not entirely unattractive young ladies of 
his acquaintance; he had enjoyed the warnings about the evils and dangers of London, 
and the gift of the white umbrella with the map of the London Underground on it that 
his friends had chipped in money to buy; he had enjoyed the first few pints of ale; but 
then, with each successive pint he found that he was enjoying himself significantly less; 
until now he was sitting and shivering on the sidewalk outside the pub in a small 
Scottish town, weighing the relative merits of being sick and not being sick, and not 
enjoying himself at all. 
Inside the pub, Richard's friends continued to celebrate his forthcoming departure 
with an enthusiasm that, to Richard, was beginning to border on the sinister. He sat on 
the sidewalk and held on tightly to the rolled-up umbrella, and wondered whether going 
south to London was really a good idea. 
"You want to keep a eye out," said a cracked old voice. "They'll be moving you on 
before you can say Jack Robinson. Or taking you in, I wouldn't be surprised." Two 
sharp eyes stared out from a beaky, grimy face. "You all right?" 
"Yes, thank you," said Richard. He was a fresh-faced, boyish young man, with 
dark, slightly curly hair and large hazel eyes; he had a rumpled, just-woken-up look to 
him, which made him more attractive to the opposite sex than he would ever understand 
or believe. 
The grimy face softened. "Here, poor thing," she said, and pushed a fifty-pence 
piece into Richard's hand. " 'Ow long you been on the streets, then?" 
"I'm not homeless," explained Richard, embarrassed, attempting to give the old 
woman her coin back. "Please—take your money. I'm fine. I just came out here to get 
some air. I go to London tomorrow," he added. 
She peered down at him suspiciously, then took back her fifty pence and made it 
vanish beneath the layers of coats and shawls in which she was enveloped. "I've been to 
London," she confided. "I was married in London. But he was a bad lot. Me mam told 
me not to go marrying outside, but I was young and beautiful, although you'd never 
credit it today, and I followed my heart." 
"I'm sure you did," said Richard. The conviction that he was about to be sick was 
starting, slowly, to fade. 
"Fat lot of good it done me. I been homeless, so I know what it's like," said the old 
woman. "That's why I thought you was. What you going to London for?" 
"I've got a job," he told her proudly. 
"Doing what?" she asked. 
"Um, Securities," said Richard. 
"I was a dancer," said the old woman, and she tottered awkwardly around the 
sidewalk, humming tunelessly to herself. Then she teetered from side to side like a 

spinning top coming to rest, and finally she stopped, facing Richard. "Hold out your 
hand," she told him, "and I'll tell yer fortune." He did as he was told. She put her old 
hand into his, and held it tightly, and then she blinked a few times, like an owl who had 
swallowed a mouse that was beginning to disagree with it. "You got a long way to go 
. . . " she said, puzzled. 
"London," Richard told her. 
"Not just London . . . " The old woman paused. "Not any London I know." It 
started to rain then, softly. "I'm sorry," she said. "It starts with doors." 
"Doors?" 
She nodded. The rain fell harder, pattering on the roofs and on the asphalt of the 
road. "I'd watch out for doors if I were you." 
Richard stood up, a little unsteadily. "All right," he said, a little unsure of how he 
ought to treat information of this nature. "I will. Thanks." 
The pub door was opened, and light and noise spilled out into the street. "Richard? 
You all right?" 
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be back in a second." The old lady was already wobbling down 
the street, into the pelting rain, getting wet. Richard felt he had to do something for her: 
he couldn't give her money, though. He hurried after her, down the narrow street, the 
cold rain drenching his face and hair. "Here," said Richard. He fumbled with the handle 
of the umbrella, trying to find the button that opened it. Then a click, and it blossomed 
into a huge white map of the London Underground network, each line drawn in a 
different color, every station marked and named. 
The old woman took the umbrella, gratefully, and smiled her thanks. "You've a 
good heart," she told him. "Sometimes that's enough to see. you safe wherever you go." 
Then she shook her head. "But mostly, it's not." She clutched the umbrella tightly as a 
gust of wind threatened to tug it away from her or pull it inside out. She wrapped her 
arms around it and bent almost double against the rain and the wind. Then she walked 
away into the rain and the night, a round white shape covered with the names of 
London Tube stations—Earl's Court, Marble Arch, Blackfriars, White City, Victoria, 
Angel, Oxford Circus . . .  
Richard found himself pondering, drunkenly, whether there really was a circus at 
Oxford Circus: a real circus with clowns, beautiful women, and dangerous beasts. The 
pub door opened once more: a blast of sound, as if the pub's volume control had just 
been turned up high. "Richard, you idiot, it's your bloody party, and you're missing all 
the fun." He walked back in the pub, the urge to be sick lost in all the oddness. 
"You look like a drowned rat," said someone. 
"You've never seen a drowned rat," said Richard. 
Someone else handed him a large whisky. "Here, get that down you. That'll warm 
you up. You know, you won't be able to get real Scotch in London." 
"I'm sure I will," sighed Richard. Water was dripping from his hair into his drink. 
"They have everything in London." And he downed the Scotch, and after that someone 
bought him another, and then the evening blurred and broke up into fragments: 
afterward he remembered only the feeling that he was about to leave somewhere small 
and rational—a place that made sense—for somewhere huge and old that didn't; and 

vomiting interminably into a gutter flowing with rainwater, somewhere in the small 
hours of the morning; and a white shape marked with strange-colored symbols, like a 
little round beetle, walking away from him in the rain. 
The next morning he boarded the train for the six-hour journey south that would 
bring him to the strange gothic spires and arches of St. Pancras Station. His mother 
gave him a small walnut cake that she had made for the journey and a thermos filled 
with tea; and Richard Mayhew went to London feeling like hell. 

ONE 
She had been running for four days now, a harum-scarum tumbling flight through 
passages and tunnels. She was hungry, and exhausted, and more tired than a body could 
stand, and each successive door was proving harder to open. After four days of flight, 
she had found a hiding place, a tiny stone burrow, under the world, where she would be 
safe, or so she prayed, and at last she slept. 
  
Mr. Croup had hired Ross at the last Floating Market, which had been held in 
Westminster Abbey. "Think of him," he told Mr. Vandemar, "as a canary." 
"Sings?" asked Mr. Vandemar. 
"I doubt it; I sincerely and utterly doubt it." Mr. Croup ran a hand through his lank 
orange hair. "No, my fine friend, I was thinking metaphorically—more along the lines 
of the birds they take down mines." Mr. Vandemar nodded, comprehension dawning 
slowly: yes, a canary. Mr. Ross had no other resemblance to a canary. He was huge—
almost as big as Mr. Vandemar—and extremely grubby, and quite hairless, and he said 
very little, although he had made a point of telling each of them that he liked to kill 
things, and he was good at it; and this amused Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. But he 
was a canary, and he never knew it. So Mr. Ross went first, in his filthy T-shirt and his 
crusted blue-jeans, and Croup and Vandemar walked behind him, in their elegant black 
suits. 
There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar 
apart: first, Mr. Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr. Croup; second, Mr. 
Croup has eyes of a faded china blue, while Mr. Vandemar's eyes are brown; third, 
while Mr. Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of 
four ravens, Mr. Croup has no obvious jewelery; fourth, Mr. Croup likes words, while 
Mr. Vandemar is always hungry. Also, they look nothing at all alike. 
A rustle in the tunnel darkness; Mr. Vandemar's knife was in his hand, and then it 
was no longer in his hand, and it was quivering gently almost thirty feet away. He 
walked over to his knife and picked it up by the hilt. There was a gray rat impaled on 
the blade, its mouth opening and closing impotently as the life fled. He crushed its skull 
between finger and thumb. 
"Now, there's one rat that won't be telling any more tales," said Mr. Croup. He 
chuckled at his own joke. Mr. Vandemar did not respond. "Rat. Tales. Get it?" 
Mr. Vandemar pulled the rat from the blade and began to munch on it, 
thoughtfully, head first. Mr. Croup slapped it out of his hands. "Stop that," he said. Mr. 
Vandemar put his knife away, a little sullenly. "Buck up," hissed Mr. Croup, 
encouragingly. "There will always be another rat. Now: onward. Things to do. People 
to damage." 
  
Three years in London had not changed Richard, although it had changed the way 
he perceived the city. Richard had originally imagined London as a gray city, even a 
black city, from pictures he had seen, and he was surprised to find it filled with color. It 

was a city of red brick and white stone, red buses and large black taxis, bright red 
mailboxes and green grassy parks and cemeteries. 
It was a city in which the very old and the awkwardly new jostled each other, not 
uncomfortably, but without respect; a city of shops and offices and restaurants and 
homes, of parks and churches, of ignored monuments and remarkably unpalatial 
palaces; a city of hundreds of districts with strange names—Crouch End, Chalk Farm, 
Earl's Court, Marble Arch—and oddly distinct identities; a noisy, dirty, cheerful, 
troubled city, which fed on tourists, needed them as it despised them, in which the 
average speed of transportation through the city had not increased in three hundred 
years, following five hundred years of fitful road-widening and unskillful compromises 
between the needs of traffic, whether horse-drawn, or, more recently, motorized, and 
the needs of pedestrians; a city inhabited by and teeming with people of every color and 
manner and kind. 
When he had first arrived, he had found London huge, odd, fundamentally 
incomprehensible, with only the Tube map, that elegant multicolored topographical 
display of underground railway lines and stations, giving it any semblance of order. 
Gradually he realized that the Tube map was a handy fiction that made life easier but 
bore no resemblance to the reality of the shape of the city above. It was like belonging 
to a political party, he thought once, proudly, and then, having tried to explain the 
resemblance between the Tube map and politics, at a party, to a cluster of bewildered 
strangers, he had decided in the future to leave political comment to others. 
He continued, slowly, by a process of osmosis and white knowledge (which is like 
white noise, only more useful), to comprehend the city, a process that accelerated when 
he realized that the actual City of London itself was no bigger than a square mile, 
stretching from Aldgate in the east to Fleet Street and the law courts of the Old Bailey 
in the west, a tiny municipality, now home to London's financial institutions, and that 
that was where it had all begun. 
Two thousand years before, London had been a little Celtic village on the north 
shore of the Thames, which the Romans had encountered, then settled in. London had 
grown, slowly, until, roughly a thousand years later, it met the tiny Royal City of 
Westminster immediately to the west, and, once London Bridge had been built, London 
touched the town of Southwark directly across the river; and it continued to grow, fields 
and woods and marshland slowly vanishing beneath the flourishing town, and it 
continued to expand, encountering other little villages and hamlets as it grew, like 
Whitechapel and Dept-ford to the east, Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush to the west, 
Camden and Islington in the north, Battersea and Lambeth across the Thames to the 
south, absorbing all of them, just as a pool of mercury encounters and incorporates 
smaller beads of mercury, leaving only their names behind. 
London grew into something huge and contradictory. It was a good place, and a 
fine city, but there is a price to be paid for all good places, and a price that all good 
places have to pay. 
After a while, Richard found himself taking London for granted; in time, he began 
to pride himself on having visited none of the sights of London (except for the Tower 
of London, when his Aunt Maude came down to the city for a weekend, and Richard 
found himself her reluctant escort). 

But Jessica changed all that. Richard found himself, on otherwise sensible 
weekends, accompanying her to places like the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery, 
where he learned that walking around museums too long hurts your feet, that the great 
art treasures of the world all blur into each other after a while, and that it is almost 
beyond the human capacity for belief to accept how much museum cafeterias will 
brazenly charge for a slice of cake and a cup of tea. 
"Here's your tea and your éclair," he told her. "It would have cost less to buy one 
of those Tintorettos." 
"Don't exaggerate," said Jessica cheerfully. "Anyway, there aren't any Tintorettos 
at the Tate." 
"I should have had that cherry cake," said Richard. "Then they would have been 
able to afford another Van Gogh." 
Richard had met Jessica in France, on a weekend trip to Paris two years earlier; 
had in fact discovered her in the Louvre, trying to find the group of his office friends 
who had organized the trip. Staring up at an immense sculpture, he had stepped 
backwards into Jessica, who was admiring an extremely large and historically 
important diamond. He tried to apologize to her in French, which he did not speak, 
gave up, and began to apologize in English, then tried to apologize in French for having 
to apologize in English, until he noticed that Jessica was about as English as it was 
possible for any one person to be. By this time she decided he should buy her an 
expensive French sandwich and some overpriced carbonated apple juice, by way of 
apology, and, well, that was the start of it all, really. He had never been able to 
convince Jessica that he wasn't the kind of person who went to art galleries after that. 
On weekends when they did not go to art galleries or to museums, Richard would 
trail behind Jessica as she went shopping, which she did, on the whole, in affluent 
Knightsbridge, a short walk and an even shorter taxi ride from her apartment in a 
Kensington mews. Richard would accompany Jessica on her tours of such huge and 
intimidating emporia as Harrods and Harvey Nichols, stores where Jessica was able to 
purchase anything, from jewelry, to books, to the week's groceries. 
Richard had been awed by Jessica, who was beautiful, and often quite funny, and 
was certainly going somewhere. And Jessica saw in Richard an enormous amount of 
potential, which, properly harnessed by the right woman, would have made him the 
perfect matrimonial accessory. If only he were a little more focused, she would murmur 
to herself, and so she gave him books with titles like Dress for Success and A Hundred 
and Twenty-Five Habits of Successful Men, and books on how to run a business like a 
military campaign, and Richard always said thank you, and always intended to read 
them. In Harvey Nichols's men's fashion department she would pick out for him the 
kinds of clothes she thought that he should wear—and he wore them, during the week, 
anyway; and, a year to the day after their first encounter, she told him she thought it 
was time that they went shopping for an engagement ring. 
"Why do you go out with her?" asked Gary, in Corporate Accounts, eighteen 
months later. "She's terrifying." 
Richard shook his head. "She's really sweet, once you get to know her." 
Gary put down the plastic troll doll he had picked up from Richard's desk. "I'm 
surprised she still lets you play with these." 

"The subject has never come up," said Richard, picking up one of the creatures 
from his desk. It had a shock of Day-Glo orange hair, and a slightly baffled expression, 
as if it were lost. 
And the subject had indeed come up. Jessica had, however, convinced herself that 
Richard's troll collection was a mark of endearing eccentricity, comparable to Mr. 
Stockton's collection of angels. Jessica was in the process of organizing a traveling 
exhibition of Mr. Stockton's angel collection, and she had come to the conclusion that 
great men always collected something. In actuality Richard did not really collect trolls. 
He had found a troll on the sidewalk outside the office, and, in a vain attempt at 
injecting a little personality into his working world, he had placed it on his computer 
monitor. The others had followed over the next few months, gifts from colleagues who 
had noticed that Richard had a penchant for the ugly little creatures. He had taken the 
gifts and positioned them, strategically, around his desk, beside the telephones and the 
framed photograph of Jessica. 
The photograph had a yellow Post-it note stuck to it. 
It was a Friday afternoon. Richard had noticed that events were cowards: they 
didn't occur singly, but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once. 
Take this particular Friday, for example. It was, as Jessica had pointed out to him at 
least a dozen times in the last month, the most important day of his life. So it was 
unfortunate that, despite the Post-it note Richard had left on his fridge door at home, 
and the other Post-it note he had placed on the photograph of Jessica on his desk, he 
had forgotten about it completely and utterly. 
Also, there was the Wandsworth report, which was overdue and taking up most of 
his head. Richard checked another row of figures; then he noticed that page 17 had 
vanished, and he set it up to print out again; and another page down, and he knew that if 
he were only left alone to finish it . . . if, miracle of miracles, the phone did not ring . . . 
It rang. He thumbed the speakerphone. 
"Hello? Richard? The managing director needs to know when he'll have the 
report." 
Richard looked at his watch. "Five minutes, Sylvia. It's almost wrapped up. I just 
have to attach the P & L projection." 
"Thanks, Dick. I'll come down for it." Sylvia was, as she liked to explain, "the 
MD's PA," and she moved in an atmosphere of crisp efficiency. He thumbed the 
speakerphone off; it rang again, immediately. "Richard," said the speaker, with Jessica's 
voice, "it's Jessica. You haven't forgotten, have you?" 
"Forgotten?" He tried to remember what he could have forgotten. He looked at 
Jessica's photograph for inspiration and found all the inspiration he could have needed 
in the shape of a yellow Post-it note stuck to her forehead. 
"Richard? Pick up the telephone." 
He picked up the phone, reading the Post-it note as he did so. "Sorry, Jess. No, I 
hadn't forgotten. Seven P.M., at Ma Maison Italiano. Should I meet you there?" 
"Jessica, Richard. Not Jess." She paused for a moment. "After what happened last 
time? I don't think so. You really could get lost in your own backyard, Richard." 

Richard thought about pointing out that anyone could have confused the National 
Gallery with the National Portrait Gallery, and that it wasn't she who had spent the 
whole day standing in the rain (which was, in his opinion, every bit as much fun as 
walking around either place until his feet hurt), but he thought better of it. 
"I'll meet you at your place," said Jessica. "We can walk down together." 
"Right, Jess. Jessica—sorry." 
"You have confirmed our reservation, haven't you, Richard." 
"Yes," lied Richard earnestly. The other line on his phone had begun to ring. 
"Jessica, look, I . . . " 
"Good," said Jessica, and she broke the connection. He picked up the other line. 
"Hi Dick. It's me, Gary." Gary sat a few desks down from Richard. He waved. 
"Are we still on for drinks? You said we could go over the Merstham account." 
"Get off the bloody phone, Gary. Of course we are." Richard put down the phone. 
There was a telephone number at the bottom of the Post-it note; Richard had written the 
Post-it note to himself, several weeks earlier. And he had made the reservation: he was 
almost certain of that. But he had not confirmed it. He had kept meaning to, but there 
had been so much to do and Richard had known that there was plenty of time. But 
events run in packs . . .  
Sylvia was now standing next to him. "Dick? The Wandsworth report?" 
"Almost ready, Sylvia. Look, just hold on a sec, can you?" 
He finished punching in the number, breathed a sigh of relief when somebody 
answered, "Ma Maison. Can I help you?" 
"Yes," said Richard. "A table for three, for tonight. I think I booked it. And if I did 
I'm confirming the reservation. And if I didn't, I wondered if I could book it. Please." 
No, they had no record of a table for tonight in the name of Mayhew. Or Stockton. Or 
Bartram—Jessica's surname. And as for booking a table . . .  
It wasn't the words that Richard found so unpleasant: it was the tone of voice in 
which the information was transmitted. A table for tonight should certainly have been 
booked years before—perhaps, it was implied, by Richard's parents. A table for tonight 
was impossible: if the pope, the prime minister, and the president of France arrived this 
evening without a confirmed reservation, even they would be turned out into the street 
with a continental jeer. "But it's for my fiancee's boss. I know I should have phoned 
before. There are only three of us, can't you please . . . " 
They had put down the phone. 
"Richard?" said Sylvia. "The MD's waiting." 
"Do you think," asked Richard, "they'd give me a table if I phoned back and 
offered them extra money?" 
  
In her dream they were all together in the house. Her parents, her brother, her baby 
sister. They were standing together in the ballroom, staring at her. They were all so 
pale, so grave. Portia, her mother, touched her cheek and told her that she was in 
danger. In her dream, Door laughed, and said she knew. Her mother shook her head: 
no, no—now she was in danger. Now. 

Door opened her eyes. The door was opening, quietly, quietly; she held her breath. 
Footsteps, quiet on the stone. Perhaps he won't notice me, she thought. Perhaps he'll go 
away. And then she thought, desperately, I'm hungry. 
The footsteps hesitated. She was well hidden, she knew, under a pile of 
newspapers and rags. And it was possible that the intruder meant her no harm. Can't he 
hear my heartbeat? she thought. And then the footsteps came closer, and she knew 
what she had to do, and it scared her. A hand pulled the covers off her, and she looked 
up into a blank, utterly hairless face, which creased into a vicious smile. She rolled, 
then, and twisted, and the knife blade, aimed at her chest, caught her in the upper arm. 
Until that moment, she had never thought she could do it. Never thought she 
would be brave enough, or scared enough, or desperate enough to dare. But she reached 
up one hand to his chest, and she opened . . .  
He gasped, and tumbled onto her. It was wet and warm and slippery, and she 
slithered and staggered out from under the man, and she stumbled out of the room. 
She caught her breath in the tunnel outside, narrow and low, as she fell against the 
wall, breathing in gasps and sobs. That had taken the last of her strength; now she was 
spent. Her shoulder was beginning to throb. The knife, she thought. But she was safe. 
"My, oh my," said a voice from the darkness on her right. "She survived Mister 
Ross. Well I never, Mister Vandemar." The voice oozed. It sounded like gray slime. 
"Well I never either, Mister Croup," said a flat voice on her left. 
A light was kindled and flickered. "Still," said Mr. Croup, his eyes gleaming in the 
dark beneath the earth, "she won't survive us." 
Door kneed him, hard, in the groin: and then she pushed herself forward, her right 
hand holding her left shoulder. 
And she ran. 
  
"Dick?" 
Richard waved away the interruption. Life was almost under his control, now. Just 
a little more time . . .  
Gary said his name again. "Dick? It's six-thirty." 
"It's what?" Papers and pens and spreadsheets and trolls were tumbled into 
Richard's briefcase. He snapped it shut and ran. 
He pulled his coat on as he went. Gary was following. "Are we going to have that 
drink, then?" 
Richard paused for a moment. If ever, he decided, they made disorganization an 
Olympic sport, he could be disorganized for Britain. "Gary," he said, "I'm sorry. I blew 
it. I have to see Jessica tonight. We're taking her boss out to dinner." 
"Mister Stockton? Of Stocktons? The Stockton?" Richard nodded. They hurried 
down the stairs. "I'm sure you'll have fun," said Gary, insincerely. "And how is the 
Creature from the Black Lagoon?" 
"Jessica's from Ilford, actually, Gary. And she remains the light and love of my 
life, thank you very much for asking." They reached the lobby, and Richard made a 
dash for the automatic doors, which spectacularly failed to open. 

"It's after six, Mister Mayhew," said Mr. Figgis, the building's security guard. 
"You have to sign out." 
"I don't need this," said Richard to no one in particular, "I really don't." 
Mr. Figgis smelled vaguely of medicinal liniment and was widely rumored to have 
an encyclopedic collection of soft-core pornography. He guarded the doors with a 
diligence that bordered upon madness, never quite having lived down the evening when 
an entire floor's worth of computer equipment upped and left, along with two potted 
palms and the managing director's Axminster carpet. 
"So our drink's off, then?" 
"I'm sorry, Gary. Is Monday okay for you?" 
"Sure. Monday's fine. See you Monday." 
Mr. Figgis inspected their signatures and satisfied himself they had no computers, 
potted palms, or carpets about their persons, then he pressed a button under his desk, 
and the door slid open. 
"Doors," said Richard. 
  
The underway branched and divided; she picked her way at random, ducking 
through tunnels, running and stumbling and weaving. Behind her strolled Mr. Croup 
and Mr. Vandemar, as calmly and cheerfully as Victorian dignitaries visiting the 
Crystal Palace exhibition. When they arrived at a crossroads, Mr. Croup would kneel 
and find the nearest spot of blood, and they would follow it. They were like hyenas, 
exhausting their prey. They could wait. They had all the time in the world. 
  
Luck was with Richard, for a change. He caught a black taxi, driven by an elderly 
man who took Richard home by an unlikely route involving streets Richard had never 
before seen, while holding forth, as Richard had discovered all London taxi drivers will 
hold forth—given a living, breathing, English-speaking passenger—on London's inner-
city traffic problems, how best to deal with crime, and thorny political issues of the day. 
Richard jumped out of the cab, left a tip and his briefcase behind, managed to flag 
down the cab again before it made it into the main road and so got his briefcase back, 
then he ran up the stairs and into his apartment. He was already shedding clothes as he 
entered the hall: his briefcase spun across the room and crash-landed on the sofa; he 
took his keys from his pocket and placed them carefully on the hall table, in order to 
ensure he did not forget them. 
Then he dashed into the bedroom. The buzzer sounded. Richard, three-quarters of 
the way into his best suit, launched himself at the speaker. 
"Richard? It's Jessica. I hope you're ready." 
"Oh. Yes. Be right, down." He pulled on a coat, and he ran, slamming the door 
behind him. Jessica was waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. She always waited 
for him there. Jessica didn't like Richard's apartment: it made her feel uncomfortably 
female. There was always the chance of finding a pair of Richard's underwear, well, 
anywhere, not to mention the wandering lumps of congealed toothpaste on the 
bathroom sink: no, it was not Jessica's kind of place. 

Jessica was very beautiful; so much so Richard would occasionally find himself 
staring at her, wondering, how did she end up with me? And when they made love—
which they did at Jessica's apartment in fashionable Kensington, in Jessica's brass bed 
with the crisp white linen sheets (for Jessica's parents had told her that down comforters 
were decadent)—in the darkness, afterwards, she would hold him very tightly, and her 
long brown curls would tumble over his chest, and she would whisper to him how 
much she loved him, and he would tell her he loved her and always wanted to be with 
her, and they both believed it to be true. 
  
"Bless me, Mister Vandemar. She's slowing up." 
"Slowing up, Mister Croup." 
"She must be losing a lot of blood, Mister V." 
"Lovely blood, Mister C. Lovely wet blood," 
"Not long now." 
A click: the sound of a switchblade opening, empty and lonely and dark. 
  
"Richard? What are you doing?" asked Jessica. 
"Nothing, Jessica." 
"You haven't forgotten your keys again, have you?" 
"No, Jessica." Richard stopped patting himself and pushed his hands deep into the 
pockets of his coat. 
"Now, when you meet Mister Stockton tonight," said Jessica, "you have to 
appreciate that he's not just a very important man. He's also a corporate entity in his 
own right." 
"I can't wait," sighed Richard. 
"What was that, Richard?" 
"I can't wait," said Richard, rather more enthusiastically. 
"Oh, please hurry up," said Jessica, who was beginning to exude an aura of what, 
in a lesser woman, might almost have been described as nerves. "We mustn't keep 
Mister Stockton waiting." 
"No, Jess." 
"Don't call me that, Richard. I loathe pet names. They're so demeaning." 
"Spare any change?" The man sat in a doorway. His beard was yellow and gray, 
and his eyes were sunken and dark. A hand-lettered sign hung from a piece of frayed 
string around his neck and rested on his chest, telling anyone with the eyes to read it 
that he was homeless and hungry. It didn't take a sign to tell you that; Richard, hand 
already in his pocket, fumbled for a coin. 
"Richard. We haven't got the time," said Jessica, who gave to charity and invested 
ethically. "Now, I do want you to make a good impression, fiance-wise. It is vital that a 
future spouse makes a good impression." And then her face creased, and she hugged 
him for a moment, and said, "Oh, Richard. I do love you. You do know that, don't 
you?" 

And Richard nodded, and he did. 
Jessica checked her watch and increased her pace. Richard discreetly flicked a 
pound coin back through the air toward the man in the doorway, who caught it in one 
grimy hand. 
"There wasn't any problem with the reservations, was there?" asked Jessica. And 
Richard, who was not much good at lying when faced with a direct question, said, 
"Ah." 
  
She had chosen wrongly—the corridor ended in a blank wall. Normally that would 
hardly have given her pause, but she was so tired, so hungry, in so much pain . . . She 
leaned against the wall, feeling the brick's roughness against her face. She was gulping 
breath, hiccuping and sobbing. Her arm was cold, and her left hand was numb. She 
could go no farther, and the world was beginning to feel very distant. She wanted to 
stop, to lie down, and to sleep for a hundred years. 
"Oh, bless my little black soul, Mister Vandemar, do you see what I see?" The 
voice was soft, close: they must have been nearer to her than she had imagined. "I spy, 
with my little eye, something that's going to be—" 
"Dead in a minute, Mister Croup," said the flat voice, from above her. 
"Our principal will be delighted." 
And the girl pulled whatever she could find deep inside her soul, from all the pain, 
and the hurt, and the fear. She was spent, burnt out, and utterly exhausted. She had 
nowhere to go, no power left, no time. "If it's the last door I open," she prayed, silently, 
to the Temple, to the Arch. "Somewhere . . . anywhere . . . safe . . . " and then she 
thought, wildly, "Somebody." 
And, as she began to pass out, she tried to open a door. 
As the darkness took her, she heard Mr. Croup's voice, as if from a long way 
away. It said, "Bugger and blast." 
  
Jessica and Richard walked down the sidewalk toward the restaurant. She had her 
arm through his, and was walking as fast as her heels permitted. He hurried to keep up. 
Streetlights and the fronts of closed stores illuminated their path. They passed a stretch 
of tall, looming buildings, abandoned and lonely, bounded by a high brick wall. 
"You are honestly telling me you had to promise them an extra fifty pounds for 
our table tonight? You are an idiot, Richard," said Jessica, her dark eyes flashing. 
"They had lost my reservation. And they said all the tables were booked." Their 
steps echoed off the high walls. 
"They'll probably have us sitting by the kitchen," said Jessica. "Or the door. Did 
you tell them it was for Mister Stockton?" 
"Yes," replied Richard. 
Jessica sighed. She continued to drag him along, as a door opened in the wall, a 
little way ahead of them. Someone stepped out and stood swaying for one long terrible 
moment, and then collapsed to the concrete. Richard shivered and stopped in his tracks. 
Jessica tugged him into motion. 

"Now, when you're talking to Mister Stockton, you must make sure you don't 
interrupt him. Or disagree with him—he doesn't like to be disagreed with. When he 
makes a joke, laugh. If you're in any doubt as to whether or not he's made a joke, look 
at me. I'll . . . mm, tap my forefinger." 
They had reached the person on the sidewalk. Jessica stepped over the crumpled 
form. Richard hesitated. "Jessica?" 
"You're right. He might think I'm bored," she mused. "I know," she said brightly, 
"if he makes a joke, I'll rub my earlobe." 
"Jessica?" He could hot believe that she was simply ignoring the figure at their 
feet. 
"What?" She was not pleased to be jerked out of her reverie. 
"Look." 
He pointed to the sidewalk. The person was face down, and enveloped in bulky 
clothes; Jessica took his arm and tugged him toward her. "Oh. I see. If you pay them 
any attention, Richard, they'll walk all over you. They all have homes, really. Once 
she's slept it off, I'm sure she'll be fine." She? Richard looked down. It was a girl. 
Jessica continued, "Now, I've told Mister Stockton that we . . . " Richard was down on 
one knee. "Richard? What are you doing?" 
"She isn't drunk," said Richard. "She's hurt." He looked at his fingertips. "She's 
bleeding." 
Jessica looked down at him, nervous and puzzled. "We're going to be late," she 
pointed out. 
"She's hurt." 
Jessica looked back at the girl on the sidewalk. Priorities: Richard had no 
priorities. "Richard. We're going to be late. Someone else will be along; someone else 
will help her." 
The girl's face was crusted with dirt, and her clothes were wet with blood. "She's 
hurt," he said, simply. There was an expression on his face that Jessica hadn't seen 
before. 
"Richard," she warned, and then she relented, a little, and offered a compromise. 
"Dial 999 and call an ambulance then. Quickly, now." 
Suddenly the girl's eyes opened, white and wide in a face that was little more than 
a smudge of dust and blood. "Not a hospital, please. They'll find me. Take me 
somewhere safe. Please." Her voice was weak. 
"You're bleeding," said Richard. He looked to see where she had come from, but 
the wall was blank and brick and unbroken. He looked back to her still form, and asked, 
"Why not a hospital?" 
"Help me?" the girl whispered and her eyes closed. 
Again he asked her, "Why don't you want to go to the hospital?" This time there 
was no answer at all. 
"When you call the ambulance," said Jessica, "don't give your name. You might 
have to make a statement or something, and then we'd be late . . . Richard? What are 
you doing?" 

Richard had picked the girl up, cradling her in his arms. She was surprisingly light. 
"I'm taking her back to my place, Jess. I can't just leave her. Tell Mister Stockton I'm 
really sorry, but it was an emergency. I'm sure he'll understand." 
"Richard Oliver Mayhew," said Jessica, coldly. "You put that girl down and come 
back here this minute. Or this engagement is at an end as of now. I'm warning you." 
Richard felt the sticky warmth of blood soaking into his shirt. Sometimes, he 
realized, there is nothing you can do. He walked away, leaving behind Jessica, who 
stood there on the sidewalk, her eyes stung with tears. 
  
Richard did not, at any point on his walk, stop to think. It was not something over 
which he had any volition. Somewhere in the sensible part of his head, someone—a 
normal, sensible Richard Mayhew—was telling him how ridiculous he was being: that 
he should just have called the police, or an ambulance; that it was dangerous to lift an 
injured person; that he had really, seriously upset Jessica; that he was going to have to 
sleep on the sofa tonight; that he was ruining his only really good suit; that the girl 
smelled terrible . . . but Richard found himself placing one foot in front of the other, 
and, arms cramping and back hurting, ignoring the looks he got from passers-by, he just 
kept walking. And after a while he was at the ground floor door of his building, and he 
was stumbling up the staircase, and then he was standing in front of the door to his 
apartment and realizing that he had left his keys on the hall table, inside . . .  
The girl reached out one filthy hand to the door, and it swung open. 
Never thought I'd be pleased that the door hadn't latched properly, thought 
Richard, and he carried the girl in—closing the door behind him with his foot—and put 
her down on his bed. His shirtfront was soaked in blood. 
She seemed semiconscious; her eyes were closed, but fluttering. He peeled off her 
leather jacket. There was a long cut on her left upper arm and shoulder. Richard caught 
his breath. "Look, I'm going to call a doctor," he said quietly. "Can you hear me?" 
Her eyes opened, wide and scared. "Please, no. It'll be fine. It's not as bad as it 
looks. I just need sleep. No doctors." 
"But your arm—your shoulder—" 
"I'll be fine. Tomorrow. Please?" It was little more than a whisper. 
"Um, I suppose, all right," and with sanity beginning to assert itself, he said, 
"Look, can I ask—?" 
But she was asleep. Richard took an old scarf from his closet and wrapped it 
firmly around her left upper arm and shoulder; he did not want her to bleed to death on 
his bed before he could get her to a doctor. And then he tiptoed out of his bedroom and 
shut the door behind him. He sat down on the sofa, in front of the television, and 
wondered what he had done. 

TWO 
He is somewhere deep beneath the ground: in a tunnel, perhaps, or a sewer. Light 
comes in flickers, defining the darkness, not dispelling it. He is not alone. There are 
other people walking beside him, although he cannot see their faces. They are running, 
now, through the inside of the sewer, splashing through the mud and filth. Droplets of 
water fall slowly through the air, crystal clear in the darkness. 
He turns a corner, and the beast is waiting for him. 
It is huge. It fills the space of the sewer: massive head down, bristled body and 
breath steaming in the chill of the air. Some kind of boar, he thinks at first, and then 
realizes that no boar could be so huge. It is the size of a bull, of a tiger, of an ox. 
It stares at him, and it pauses for a hundred years, while he lifts his spear. He 
glances at his hand, holding the spear, and observes that it is not his hand: the arm is 
furred with dark hair, the nails are almost claws. 
And then the beast charges. 
He throws his spear, but it is already too late, and he feels the beast slice his side 
with razor-sharp tusks, feels his life slip away into the mud: and he realizes he has 
fallen face down into the water, which crimsons in thick swirls of suffocating blood. 
And he tries so to scream, he tries to wake up, but he can breathe only mud and blood 
and water, he can feel only pain . . .  
"Bad dream?" asked the girl. 
Richard sat up on the couch, gasping for breath. The curtains were still drawn, the 
lights and the television still on, but he could tell, from the pale light coming in through 
the cracks, that it was morning. He fumbled on the couch for the remote control, which 
had wedged itself into the small of his back during the night, and he turned off the 
television. 
"Yes," he said. "Sort of." 
He wiped away the sleep from his eyes and took stock of himself, pleased to 
notice that he had at least taken off his shoes and jacket before he had fallen asleep. His 
shirtfront was covered with dried blood and with dirt. The homeless girl didn't say 
anything. She looked bad: pale, beneath the grime and brown dried blood, and small. 
She was dressed in a variety of clothes thrown over each other: odd clothes, dirty 
velvets, muddy lace, rips and holes through which other layers and styles could be seen. 
She looked, Richard thought, as if she'd done a midnight raid on the History of Fashion 
section of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and was still wearing everything she'd 
taken. Her short hair was filthy, but looked like it might have been a dark reddish color 
under the dirt. 
"You're awake," said Richard. 
"Whose barony is this?" asked the girl. "Whose fiefdom?" 
"Um. Sorry?" 
She looked around her suspiciously. "Where am I?" 

"Newton Mansions, Little Comden Street . . . " He stopped. She had opened the 
curtains, blinking at the cold daylight. The girl stared out at the rather ordinary view 
from Richard's window, astonished, peering wide-eyed at the cars and the buses and the 
tiny sprawl of shops—a bakery, a drugstore and a liquor store—below them. 
"I'm in London Above," she said, in a small voice. 
"Yes, you're in London," said Richard. Above what? he wondered. "I think maybe 
you were in shock or something last night. That is a nasty cut on your arm." He waited 
for her to say something, to explain. She glanced at him, and then looked back down at 
the buses and the shops. Richard continued: "I, um, found you on the pavement. There 
was a lot of blood." 
"Don't worry," she said, seriously. "Most of the blood was someone else's." 
She let the curtain fall back. Then she began to unwrap the scarf, now 
bloodstained and crusted, from her arm. She examined the cut and made a face. "We're 
going to have to do something about this," she said. "Do you want to give me a hand?" 
Richard was beginning to feel a little out of his depth. "I don't really know too 
much about first aid," he said. 
"Well," she said, "if you're really squeamish you only have to hold the bandages 
and tie the ends where I can't reach. You do have bandages, don't you?" 
Richard nodded. "Oh yes," he said. "In the first aid kit. In the bathroom. Under the 
sink." And then he went into his bedroom and changed his clothes, wondering whether 
the mess on his shirt (his best shirt, bought for him by, oh God, Jessica, she would have 
a fit) would ever come off. 
  
The bloody water reminded him of something, some kind of dream he had once 
had, perhaps, but he could no longer, for the life of him, remember exactly what. He 
pulled the plug, let the water out of the sink, and filled it with clean water again, to 
which he added a cloudy splash of liquid disinfectant: the sharp antiseptic smell seemed 
so utterly sensible and medicinal, a remedy for the oddness of his situation, and his 
visitor. The girl leaned over the sink, and he splashed warm water over her arm and 
shoulder. 
Richard was never as squeamish as he thought he was. Or rather, he was 
squeamish when it came to blood on screen: a good zombie movie or even an explicit 
medical drama would leave him huddled in a corner, hyperventilating, with his hands 
over his eyes, muttering things like "Just tell me when it's over." But when it came to 
real blood, real pain, he simply did something about it. They cleaned out the cut—
which was much less severe than Richard remembered it from the night before—and 
bandaged it up, and the girl did her very best not to wince in the process. And Richard 
found himself wondering how old she was, and what she looked like under the grime, 
and why she was living on the streets and— 
"What's your name?" she asked. 
"Richard. Richard Mayhew. Dick." She nodded, as if she were committing it to 
memory. The doorbell rang. Richard looked at the mess in the bathroom, and the girl, 
and wondered how it would look to an outside observer. Such as, for example . . . "Oh 

Lord," he said, realizing the worst. "I bet it's Jess. She's going to kill me." Damage 
control. Damage control. "Look," he told the girl. "You wait in here." 
He shut the door of the bathroom behind him and walked down the hall. He 
opened the front door, and breathed a huge and quite heartfelt sigh of relief. It wasn't 
Jessica. It was—what? Mormons? Jehovah's Witnesses? The police? He couldn't tell. 
There were two of them, at any rate. 
They wore black suits, which were slightly greasy, slightly frayed, and even 
Richard, who counted himself among the sartorially dyslexic, felt there was something 
odd about the cut of the coats. They were the kind of suits that might have been made 
by a tailor two hundred years ago who had had a modern suit described to him but had 
never actually seen one. The lines were wrong, and so were the grace notes. 
A fox and a wolf, thought Richard, involuntarily. The man in front, the fox, was a 
little shorter than Richard. He had lank, greasy hair, of an unlikely orange color, and a 
pallid complexion; as Richard opened the door, he smiled, widely, and just a fraction 
too late, with teeth that looked like an accident in a graveyard. "A good morrow to you, 
good sir," he said, "on this fine and beautiful day." 
"Ah. Hello," said Richard. 
"We are conducting a personal enquiry of a delicate nature as it were, door to 
door. Do you mind if we come in?" 
"Well, it's not very convenient right now," said Richard. Then he asked, "Are you 
with the police?" The second of the visitors, a tall man, the one he had thought of as a 
wolf, his gray and black hair cut bristle-short, stood a little behind his friend, holding a 
stack of photocopies to his chest. He had said nothing until this moment—just waited, 
huge and impassive. Now he laughed, once, low and dirtily. There was something 
unhealthy about that laugh. 
"The police? Alas," said the smaller man, "we cannot claim that felicity. A career 
in law and order, although indubitably enticing, was not inscribed on the cards Dame 
Fortuna dealt my brother and me. No, we are merely private citizens. Allow me to 
make introductions. I am Mister Croup, and this gentleman is my brother, Mister 
Vandemar." 
They did not look like brothers. They did not look like anything Richard had seen 
before. "Your brother?" asked Richard. "Shouldn't you have the same name?" 
"I am impressed. What a brain, Mister Vandemar. Keen and incisive isn't the half 
of it. Some of us are so sharp," he said as he leaned in closer to Richard, went up on 
tiptoes into Richard's face, "we could just cut ourselves." Richard took an involuntary 
step backwards. "Can we come inside?" asked Mr. Croup. 
"What do you want?" 
Mr. Croup sighed, in what he obviously imagined was a rather wistful manner. 
"We are looking for our sister," he explained. "A wayward child, willful and 
headstrong, who has close to broken our poor dear widowed mother's heart." 
"Ran away," explained Mr. Vandemar, quietly. He thrust a photocopied sheet into 
Richard's hands. "She's a little . . . funny," he added, and then he twirled one finger next 
to his temple in the universal gesture to indicate mental incapacity. 
Richard looked down at the paper. It said: 

HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? 
Beneath that was a photocopy-gray photograph of a girl who looked to Richard 
like a cleaner, longer-haired version of the young lady he had left in his bathroom. 
Under that it said: 
ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF DOREEN. 
BITES AND KICKS. RUN AWAY. 
TELL US IF YOU SAW HER. 
WANT HER BACK. REWARD PAYED. 
And below that, a telephone number. Richard looked back at the photograph. It 
was definitely the girl in his bathroom. "No," he said. "I haven't seen her, I'm afraid. I'm 
sorry." 
Mr. Vandemar, however, was not listening. He had raised his head and was 
sniffing the air, like a man smelling something odd or unpleasant. Richard reached out 
to give him back his piece of paper, but the big man simply pushed past him and 
walked into the apartment, a wolf on the prowl. Richard ran after him. "What do you 
think you are doing? Will you stop that? Get out. Look, you can't go in there—" Mr. 
Vandemar was headed straight for the bathroom. Richard hoped that the girl—
Doreen?—had had the presence of mind to lock the bathroom door. But no; it swung 
open at Mr. Vandemar's push. He walked in, and Richard, feeling like a small and 
ineffectual dog yapping at the heels of a postman, followed him in. 
It was not a large bathroom. It contained a bathtub, a toilet, a sink, several bottles 
of shampoo, a bar of soap, and a towel. When Richard had left it, a couple of minutes 
before, it had also contained a dirty, bloody girl, a very bloody sink, and an open first 
aid kit. Now, it was gleamingly clean. 
There was nowhere the girl could have been hiding. Mr. Vandemar stepped out of 
the bathroom and pushed open Richard's bedroom door, walked in, looked around. "I 
don't know what you think you're doing," said Richard. "But if you two don't get out of 
my apartment this minute, I'm phoning the police." 
Then Mr. Vandemar, who had been in the process of examining Richard's living 
room, turned back toward Richard, and Richard suddenly realized that he had never 
been so scared of another human being in his life. 
And then foxy Mr. Croup said, "Why yes, whatever can have come over you, 
Mister Vandemar? It's grief for our dear sweet sibling, I'll wager, has turned his head. 
Now apologize to the gentleman, Mister Vandemar." 
Mr. Vandemar nodded, and pondered for a moment. "Thought I needed to use the 
toilet," he said. "Didn't. Sorry." 
Mr. Croup began to walk down the hall, pushing Mr. Vandemar in front of him. 
"There. Now, you'll forgive my errant brother his lack of social graces, I trust. Worry 
over our poor dear widowed mother, and over our sister, whom even as we speak is 
wandering the streets of London unloved and uncared-for, has nigh unhinged him, I'll 
be bound. But for all that, he's a good fellow to have at your side. Is't not so, stout 
fellow?" They were out of Richard's apartment now, into the stairwell. Mr. Vandemar 

said nothing. He did not look unhinged with grief. Croup turned back to Richard and 
essayed another foxy smile. "You will tell us if you see her," he said. 
"Good-bye," said Richard. Then he closed the door and locked it. And, for the first 
time since he had lived there, he attached the security chain. 
  
Mr. Croup, who had cut Richard's phone line at the first mention of calling the 
police, was starting to wonder whether he had cut the right cord or not. Twentieth-
century telecommunications technology not being his strongest point. He took one of 
the photocopies from Vandemar, and positioned it on the wall of the stairwell. "Spit!" 
he said to Vandemar. 
Mr. Vandemar hawked a mouthful of phlegm from the back of his throat and spat 
it neatly onto the back of the handbill. Mr. Croup slapped the handbill hard onto the 
wall, next to Richard's door. It stuck immediately and stuck hard. 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? it asked. 
Mr. Croup turned to Mr. Vandemar. "Do you believe him?" 
They turned back down the stairs. "Do I Hell," said Mr. Vandemar. "I could smell 
her." 
  
Richard waited by his front door until he heard the main door slam, several floors 
below. He started to walk down the hall, back toward the bathroom, when the phone 
rang loudly, startling him. He sprinted back down the hall and picked up the receiver. 
"Hello?" said Richard. "Hello?" 
No sound came out of the receiver. Instead, there was a click, and Jessica's voice 
came out of the answering machine on the table next to the phone. Her voice said, 
"Richard? This is Jessica. I'm sorry you're not there, because this would have been our 
last conversation, and I did so want to tell you this to your face." The phone, he 
realized, was completely dead. The receiver trailed a foot or so of cord, and was then 
neatly cut off. 
"You embarrassed me very deeply last night, Richard," the voice continued. "As 
far as I'm concerned our engagement is at an end. I have no intention of returning the 
ring, nor indeed of ever seeing you again. Bye." 
The tape stopped turning, there was another click, and the little red light began to 
flash. 
"Bad news?" asked the girl. She was standing just behind him, in the kitchen part 
of the apartment, with her arm neatly bandaged. She was getting out tea bags, putting 
them in mugs. The kettle was boiling. 
"Yes," said Richard. "Very bad." He walked over to her, handed her the HAVE 
YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? poster. "That's you, isn't it?" 
She raised an eyebrow. "The photograph's me." 
"And you are . . . Doreen?" 
She shook her head. "I'm Door, Richardrichard-mayhewdick. Milk and sugar?" 

Richard was feeling utterly out of his league by now. And he said, "Richard. Just 
Richard. No sugar." Then he said, "Look, if it isn't a personal question, what happened 
to you?" 
Door poured the boiling water into the mugs. "You don't want to know," she said, 
simply. 
"Oh, well, I'm sorry if I—" 
"No. Richard. Honestly, you don't want to know. It wouldn't do you any good. 
You've done more than you should have already." 
She removed the tea bags and handed him a mug of tea. He took it from her and 
realized that he was still carrying around the receiver. "Well. I mean. I couldn't just 
have left you there." 
"You could have," she said. "You didn't." She pressed herself up against the wall 
and peered out of the window. Richard walked over to the window and looked out. 
Across the street, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were coming out of the bakery, and 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? was stuck in a place of prominence in its window. 
"Are they really your brothers?" he asked. 
"Please," said Door. "Give me a break." 
He sipped his tea and tried to pretend that everything was normal. "So where were 
you?" he asked. "Just now?" 
"I was here," she said. "Look, with those two still around we have to get a message 
to . . . " She paused. "To someone who can help. I don't dare leave here." 
"Well, isn't there somewhere you could go? Someone that we could call?" 
She took the dead receiver from his hand, wire trailing, and shook her head. "My 
friends aren't on the phone," she said. She put it back in its cradle, where it sat, useless 
and lonely. Then she smiled, fast and wicked. "Breadcrumbs," she said. 
"Sorry?" said Richard. 
  
There was a little window in the back of the bedroom that looked out on an area of 
roof tiles and gutters. Door stood on Richard's bed to reach it, opened the window, and 
sprinkled the breadcrumbs around. "But I don't understand," said Richard. 
"Of course you don't," she agreed. "Now, shush." There was a flutter of wings, and 
the purple-gray-green sheen of a pigeon. It pecked at the breadcrumbs, and Door 
reached out her right hand and picked it up. It looked at her curiously but made no 
complaint. 
They sat down on the bed. Door got Richard to hold the pigeon, while she attached 
a message to its leg, using a vivid blue rubber band that Richard had previously used to 
keep his electricity bills all in one place. Richard was not an enthusiastic holder of 
pigeons, even at the best of times. "I don't see the point in this," he explained. "I mean, 
it's not a homing pigeon. It's just a normal London pigeon. The kind that craps on Lord 
Nelson." 
"That's right," said Door. Her cheek was grazed, and her dirty reddish hair was 
tangled; tangled, but not matted. And her eyes . . . Richard realized that he could not 
tell what color her eyes were. They were not blue, or green, or brown, or gray; they 

reminded him of fire opals: there were burning greens and blues, and even reds and 
yellows that vanished and glinted as she moved. She took the bird from him, gently, 
held it up, and looked it in the face. It tipped its head on one side and stared back at her 
with bead-black eyes. "Okay," she said, and then she made a noise that sounded like the 
liquid burbling of pigeons. "Okay Crrppllrr, you're looking for the marquis de Carabas. 
You got that?" 
The pigeon burbled liquidly back at her. 
"Attagirl. Now, this is important, so you'd better—" The pigeon interrupted her 
with a rather impatient-sounding burble. "I'm sorry," said Door. "You know what you're 
doing, of course." She took the bird to the window and let it go. 
Richard had watched the whole routine with some amazement. "Do you know, it 
almost sounded like it understood you?" he said, as the bird shrank in the sky and 
vanished behind some rooftops. 
"How about that," said Door. "Now. We wait." 
She went over to the bookshelf in the corner of the bedroom, found a copy of 
Mansfield Park Richard had not previously known that he possessed, and went into the 
living room. Richard followed her. She settled herself on his sofa and opened the book. 
"So is it short for Doreen?" he asked. 
"What?" 
"Your name." 
"No. It's just Door." 
"How do you spell it?" 
"D-o-o-r. Like something you walk through to go places." 
"Oh." He had to say something, so he said, "What kind of a name is Door, then?" 
And she looked at him with her odd-colored eyes, and she said, "My name." Then 
she went back to Jane Austen. 
Richard picked up the remote control and turned on the television. Then he 
changed the channel. Changed it again. Sighed. Changed it again. "So, what are we 
waiting for?" 
Door turned the page. She didn't look up. "A reply." 
"What kind of a reply?" Door shrugged. "Oh. Right." It occurred to Richard then 
that her skin was very white, now that some of the dirt and blood had been removed. He 
wondered if she were pale from illness, or from loss of blood, or if she simply didn't get 
out much, or was anemic. Maybe she'd been in prison, although she looked a bit too 
young for that. Perhaps the big man had been telling the truth when he had said she was 
mad. "Listen, when those men came over . . . " 
"Men?" A flash of the opal-colored eyes. 
"Croup and, um, Vanderbilt." 
"Vandemar." She mused for a moment, then nodded. "I suppose you could call 
them men, yes. Two legs, two arms, a head each." 
Richard kept talking. "When they came in here, before. Where were you?" 
She licked her finger and turned a page. "I was here." 

"But—" He stopped talking, out of words. There wasn't anywhere in the apartment 
that she could have hidden herself. But she hadn't left the apartment. But— 
There was a scratching noise, and a dark shape larger than a mouse scurried out 
from the mess of videotapes beneath the television. "Jesus!" said Richard, and he threw 
the remote control at it as hard as he could. It crashed into the videos with a bang. Of 
the dark shape there was no sign. 
"Richard!" said Door. 
"It's okay," he explained. "I think it was just a rat or something." 
She glared at him. "Of course it was a rat. You'll have scared it now, poor thing." 
She looked around the room, then made a low whistling noise between her front teeth. 
"Hello?" she called. She knelt on the floor, Mansfield Park abandoned. "Hello?" 
She flashed a glance back at Richard. "If you've hurt it . . . " she threatened; then, 
softly, to the room, "I'm sorry, he's an idiot. Hello?" 
"I'm not an idiot," said Richard. 
"Shh," she said. "Hello?" A pink nose and two small black eyes peered out from 
under the sofa. The rest of the head followed, and it scrutinized its surroundings 
suspiciously. It was indeed much too big to be a mouse, Richard was certain of that. 
"Hi," said Door, warmly. "Are you okay?" She extended her hand. The animal climbed 
into it, then ran up her arm, nestling in the crook of it. Door stroked its side with her 
finger. It was dark brown, with a long pink tail. There was something that looked like a 
folded piece of paper attached to its side. 
"It's a rat," said Richard. 
"Yes, it is. Are you going to apologize?" 
"What?" 
"Apologize." 
Maybe he hadn't heard her properly. Maybe he was the one who was going mad. 
"To a rat?" 
Door said nothing, fairly meaningfully. "I'm sorry," said Richard, to the rat, with 
dignity, "if I startled you." 
The rat looked up at Door. "No, he really does mean it," she said. "He's not just 
saying it. So what have you got for me?" She fumbled at the rat's side, and pulled out a 
much-folded piece of brown paper, which had been held on with something that looked 
to Richard like a vivid blue rubber band. 
She opened it up: a piece of ragged-edged brown paper, with spidery black 
handwriting on it. She read it and nodded. "Thank you," she said, to the rat. "I 
appreciate all you've done." It scampered down onto the couch, glared up at Richard for 
a moment, and then was gone in the shadows. 
The girl called Door passed the paper to Richard. "Here," she said. "Read this." 
  
It was late afternoon in Central London, and, with autumn drawing on, it was 
getting dark. Richard had taken the Tube to Tottenham Court Road and was now 
walking west down Oxford Street, holding the piece of paper. Oxford Street was the 

retail hub of London, and even now the sidewalks were packed with shoppers and 
tourists. 
"It's a message," she said, when she gave it to him. "From the marquis de 
Carabas." 
Richard was sure he had heard the name before. "That's nice," he said. "Out of 
postcards, was he?" 
"This is quicker." 
He passed the lights and the noise of the Virgin megastore, and the shop that sold 
souvenir London police helmets and little red London buses, and the place next door 
that sold individual slices of pizza, and then he turned right. 
"You have to follow the directions written on here. Try not to let anyone follow 
you." Then she sighed, and said, "I really shouldn't involve you this much." 
"If I follow these directions . . . will it get you out of here faster?" 
"Yes." 
He turned into Hanway Street. Although he had taken only a few steps from the 
well-lit bustle of Oxford Street, he might have been in another city: Hanway Street was 
empty, forsaken; a narrow, dark road, little more than an alleyway, filled with gloomy 
record shops and closed restaurants, the only light spilling out from the secretive 
drinking clubs on the upper floors of buildings. He walked along it, feeling 
apprehensive. 
" ' . . . turn right into Hanway Street, left into Hanway Place, then right again into 
Orme Passage. Stop at the first streetlight you come to . . . ' Are you sure this is right?" 
"Yes." 
He did not remember an Orme Passage, although he had been to Hanway Place 
before: there was an underground Indian restaurant there his friend Gary liked a lot. As 
far as Richard could remember, Hanway Place was a dead end. The Mandeer, that was 
the restaurant. He passed the brightly lit front door, the restaurant's steps leading 
invitingly down into the underground, and then he turned left . . .  
He had been wrong. There was an Orme Passage. He could see the sign for it, high 
on the wall. 
ORME PASSAGE Wl 
No wonder he hadn't noticed it before: it was scarcely more than a narrow 
alleyway between houses, lit by a sputtering gas-jet. You don't see many of those 
anymore, thought Richard, and he held up his instructions to the gaslight, peering at 
them. 
" 'Then turn around thrice, widdershins'?" 
"Widdershins means counterclockwise, Richard." 
He turned, three times, feeling stupid. "Look, why do I have to do all this, just to 
see your friend. I mean, all this nonsense . . . " 
"It's not nonsense. Really. Just—humor me on this, okay?" And she had smiled at 
him. 

He stopped turning. Then he walked down the alley to the end. Nothing. No one. 
Just a metal garbage can, and beside it something that might have been a pile of rags. 
"Hello?" called Richard. "Is anyone here? I'm Door's friend. Hello?" 
No. There was no one there. Richard was relieved. Now he could go home and 
explain to the girl that nothing had happened. Then he would call in the appropriate 
authorities, and they would sort it all out. He crumpled the paper into a tight ball, and 
tossed it toward the bin. 
What Richard had taken for a pile of rags unfolded, expanded, stood up in one 
fluid motion. A hand caught the crumpled paper in midair. 
"Mine, I believe," said the marquis de Carabas. He wore a huge dandyish black 
coat that was not quite a frock coat nor exactly a trench coat, and high black boots, and, 
beneath his coat, raggedy clothes. His eyes burned white in an extremely dark face. 
And he grinned white teeth, momentarily, as if at a private joke of his own, and bowed 
to Richard, and said, "De Carabas, at your service, and you are . . . ?" 
"Um," said Richard. "Er. Um." 
"You are Richard Mayhew, the young man who rescued our wounded Door. How 
is she now?" 
"Er. She's okay. Her arm's still a bit—" 
"Her recovery time will undoubtedly astonish us all. Her family had remarkable 
recuperative powers. It's a wonder anyone managed to kill them at all, isn't it?" The 
man who called himself the marquis de Carabas walked restlessly up and down the 
alley. Richard could already tell that he was the type of person who was always in 
motion, like a great cat. 
"Somebody killed Door's family?" asked Richard. 
"We're not going to get very far if you keep repeating everything I say, now, are 
we?" said the marquis, who was now standing in front of Richard. "Sit down," he 
ordered. Richard looked around the alley for something to sit on. The marquis put a 
hand on his shoulder and sent him sprawling to the cobblestones. "She knows I don't 
come cheap. What exactly is she offering me?" 
"Sorry?" 
"What's the deal? She sent you here to negotiate, young man. I'm not cheap, and I 
never give freebies." 
Richard shrugged, as well as he could shrug from a supine position. "She said to 
tell you that she wants you to accompany her home—wherever that is—and to fix her 
up with a bodyguard." 
Even when the marquis was at rest, his eyes never ceased moving. Up, down, 
around, as if he were looking for something, thinking about something. Adding, 
subtracting, evaluating. Richard wondered whether the man was quite sane. "And she's 
offering me?" 
"Well. Nothing." 
The marquis blew on his fingernails and polished them on the lapel of his 
remarkable coat. Then he turned away. "She's offering me. Nothing." He sounded 
offended. 

Richard scrambled back up to his feet. "Well, she didn't say anything about 
money. She just said she was going to have to owe you a favor." 
The eyes flashed. "Exactly what kind of favor?" 
"A really big one," said Richard. "She said she was going to have to owe you a 
really big favor." 
De Carabas grinned to himself, a hungry panther sighting a lost peasant child. 
Then he turned on Richard. "And you left her alone?" he asked. "With Croup and 
Vandemar out there? Well, what are you waiting for?" He knelt down and took from his 
pocket a small metal object, which he pushed into a manhole cover at the edge of the 
alley and twisted. The manhole cover came up easily; the marquis put away the metal 
object and took something out of another pocket that reminded Richard a little of a long 
firework, or a flare. He held it in one hand, ran his other hand along it, and the far end 
erupted into scarlet flame. 
"Can I ask a question?" said Richard. 
"Certainly not," said the marquis. "You don't ask any questions. You don't get any 
answers. You don't stray from the path. You don't even think about what's happening to 
you right now. Got it?" 
"But—" 
"Most important of all: no buts," said de Carabas. "And time is of the essence. 
Move." He pointed into the depths revealed by the open manhole cover. Richard 
moved, clambering down the metal ladder set into the wall beneath the manhole, 
feeling so far out of his depth that it didn't even occur to him to question any further. 
  
Richard wondered where they were. This didn't seem to be a sewer. Perhaps it was 
a tunnel for telephone cables, or for very small trains. Or for . . . something else. He 
realized that he did not know very much about what went on beneath the streets of 
London. He walked nervously, worried that he'd catch his feet in something, that he'd 
stumble in the darkness and break his ankle. De Carabas strode on ahead, nonchalantly, 
apparently not caring whether Richard was with him or not. The crimson flame cast 
huge shadows on the tunnel walls. 
Richard ran to catch up. "Let's see . . . " said de Carabas. "I'll need to get her to the 
market. The next one's in, mm, two days' time, if I recall correctly, as of course I 
unfailingly do. I can hide her until then." 
"Market?" asked Richard. 
"The Floating Market. But you don't want to know about that. No more questions." 
Richard looked around. "Well, I was going to ask you where we are now. But I 
suppose you were going to refuse to tell me." 
The marquis grinned once more. "Very good," he said, approvingly. "You are in 
enough trouble already." 
"You can say that again," sighed Richard. "My fiancee's dumped me, and I'll 
probably have to get a new telephone—" 
"Temple and Arch. A telephone is the least of your troubles." De Carabas put the 
flare down on the ground, resting it against the wall, where it continued to sputter and 

flame, and he began to climb up some metal rungs set into the wall. Richard hesitated, 
and then followed him. The rungs were cold and rusted; he could feel them crumbling 
roughly against his hands as he climbed, fragments of rust getting in his eyes and 
mouth. The scarlet light from below was flickering, and then it went out. They climbed 
in total darkness. 
"So, are we going back to Door?" Richard asked. 
"Eventually. There's a little something I need to organize first. Insurance. And 
when we get into daylight, don't look down." 
"Why not?" asked Richard. And then daylight hit his face, and he looked down. 
  
It was daylight (how was it daylight? a tiny voice asked, in the back of his head. It 
had been almost night when he entered the alley, what, an hour ago?), and he was 
holding onto a metal ladder that ran up the outside of a very high building (but a few 
seconds ago he was climbing up the same ladder, and he had been inside, hadn't he?), 
and below him, he could see . . .  
London. 
Tiny cars. Tiny buses and taxis. Tiny buildings. Trees. Miniature trucks. Tiny, tiny 
people. They swam in and out of focus beneath him. 
To say that Richard Mayhew was not very good at heights would be perfectly 
accurate, but it would fail to give the full picture. Richard hated clifftops, and high 
buildings: somewhere not far inside him was the fear—the stark, utter, silently 
screaming terror—that if he got too close to the edge, then something would take over 
and he would find himself walking to the edge of a clifftop and stepping off into space. 
It was as if he could not entirely trust himself, and that scared Richard more than the 
simple fear of falling ever could. So he called it vertigo, and hated it and himself, and 
kept away from high places. 
Richard froze on the ladder. His hands clamped tightly to the rungs. His eyes hurt, 
somewhere behind the eyeballs. He started breathing too fast, too deeply. "Somebody," 
said an amused voice above him, "wasn't listening, was he?" 
"I . . . " Richard's throat didn't work. He swallowed, moistening it. "I can't move." 
His hands were sweating. What if they sweated so much that he simply slipped off into 
the void . . . ? 
"Of course you can move. Or, if you don't you can stay here, hanging onto the side 
of the wall until your hands freeze and your legs buckle and you tumble to a messy 
death a thousand feet below." Richard looked up at the marquis. He was looking down 
at Richard, and still smiling; when he saw that Richard was watching him, he let go of 
the rungs with both his hands, and waggled his fingers at him. 
Richard felt a wave of sympathetic vertigo run through him. "Bastard," he said, 
under his breath, and he let go of the rung with his right hand and moved it up eight 
inches, until it found the next rung. Then he moved his right leg up one rung. Then he 
did it again, with his left hand. After a while he found himself at the edge of a flat roof, 
and he stepped over it and collapsed. 

He was aware that the marquis was striding along the roof, away from him. 
Richard felt the rooftop with his hands, and felt the solid structure beneath him. His 
heart was pounding in his chest. 
A gruff voice some distance away shouted, "You're not wanted here, de Carabas. 
Get away. Clear off." 
"Old Bailey," he heard de Carabas say. "You're looking wonderfully healthy." 
And then footsteps, shuffled toward him, and a finger prodded him gently in the 
ribs. "You all right, laddie? I've got some stew cookin' back there. You want some? It's 
starling." 
Richard opened his eyes. "No thank you," he said. He saw the feathers, first. He 
wasn't sure if it was a coat, or a cape, or some kind of strange covering that had no 
name, but whatever kind of outer garment it was, it was covered thickly and entirely in 
feathers. A face, kind and creased, with grey muttonchop whiskers, peered out from the 
top of the feathers. The body beneath the face, where it was not covered with feathers, 
was wound round and about with ropes. Richard found himself remembering a 
theatrical performance of Robinson Crusoe he had been taken to as a child: this was 
what Robinson Crusoe might have looked like, if he had been shipwrecked on a rooftop 
instead of a desert island. 
"They call me Old Bailey, lad," said the man. He fumbled at a battered pair of 
glasses, on a string around his neck, and pulled them on, staring through them at 
Richard. "I don't recognize ye. What barony do you give fealty to? What's your name?" 
Richard pulled himself into a sitting position. They were on the roof of an old 
building, built of brown stone, with a tower above them. Weathered gargoyles, missing 
wings and limbs and, in a couple of cases, even heads, jutted sadly from the corners of 
the tower. From far below he could hear the wail of a police siren, and the muted roar 
of traffic. Across the rooftop, in the shadow of the tower, was something that looked 
like a tent; an old brown tent, much mended, spackled white with bird shit. He opened 
his mouth to tell the old man his name. 
"You. Shut up," said the marquis de Carabas. "Don't say another word." Then he 
turned to Old Bailey. "People who put their noses where they aren't wanted 
sometimes"—he snapped his fingers, loudly, beneath the old man's nose, making him 
jump—"lose them. Now. You've owed me a favor for twenty years, Old Bailey. A big 
favor. And I'm calling it in." 
The old man blinked. "I was a fool," he said quietly. 
"No fool like an old fool," agreed the marquis. He reached a hand into an inside 
pocket of his coat and pulled out a silver box, larger than a snuffbox, smaller than a 
cigar box, and a good deal more ornate than either. "Do you know what this is?" 
"I wish I didn't." 
"You'll keep it safe for me." 
"I don't want it." 
"You don't have any choice," said the marquis. The old roof-man took the silver 
box from him and held it, awkwardly, in both hands, as if it were something that might 
explode at any moment. The marquis prodded Richard gently with his square-toed 
black boot: "Right," he said. "We'd better get a move on, hadn't we?" He strode off 

across the roof, and Richard got to his feet and followed, keeping well away from the 
side of the building. The marquis opened a door in the side of the tower, beside a high 
cluster of chimneys, and they went down a poorly lit spiral staircase. 
"Who was that man?" asked Richard, peering through the dim light. Their 
footsteps echoed and reverberated down the metal stairs. 
The marquis de Carabas snorted. "You haven't heard a word I've said, have you? 
You're in trouble already. Everything you do, everything you say, everything you hear, 
just makes it worse. You had better pray you haven't stepped too far in." 
It was now completely dark, and Richard stumbled slightly as he reached the last 
of the steps and found himself looking for a step that wasn't there. "Mind your head," 
said the marquis, and he opened a door. Richard banged his forehead into something 
hard and said "ow," and then he stepped out through a low door, shielding his eyes 
against the light. 
Richard rubbed his forehead, then he rubbed his eyes. The door they had just come 
through was the door to the broom closet in the stairwell of his apartment building. It 
was filled with brooms, an elderly mop, and a huge variety of cleaning fluids, powders, 
and waxes. It had no stairs at the back of it that he could see, just a wall on which a 
stained old calendar hung, quite uselessly—unless 1979 ever came back around. 
The marquis was examining the HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? poster stuck beside 
Richard's front door. "Not her best side," he said. 
Richard shut the door to the broom closet. He took his keys from his back pocket, 
unlocked his front door, and he was home. It was, he was rather relieved to see through 
the kitchen windows, night-time once more. 
"Richard," said Door. "You did it." She had washed herself while he was gone, 
and her layers of clothes looked like she had at least made an effort to get the worst of 
the filth and the blood off them. The grime was gone from her face and hands. Her hair, 
when washed, was a dark shade of auburn, with copper and bronze highlights. Richard 
wondered how old she was: fifteen? Sixteen? Older? He still couldn't tell. 
She had put on the brown leather jacket she had been wearing when he had found 
her, huge and enveloping, like an old flying jacket, which somehow made her look 
smaller than she was, and even more vulnerable. 
"Well, yes," said Richard. 
The marquis de Carabas went down on one knee to the girl and lowered his head. 
"My lady," he said. 
She seemed uncomfortable. "Oh, do get up, de Carabas. I'm pleased you came." 
He stood in one smooth movement. "I understand," he said, "that the words favor, 
really, and big have been used. In conjunction." 
"Later." She walked over to Richard and took his hands in hers. "Richard. Thanks. 
I really appreciate everything you've done. I changed the sheets on the bed. And I wish 
there was something I could do to pay you back." 
"You're leaving?" 
She nodded. "I'll be safe now. More or less. I hope. For a little while." 
"Where are you going now?" 

She smiled gently and shook her head. "Uh-uh. I'm out of your life. And you've 
been wonderful." She went up on tiptoes then and kissed him on the cheek, as friends 
kiss friends. 
"If I ever need to get in touch with you—?" 
"You don't. Ever. And . . . " and then she paused. "Look, I'm sorry, okay?" 
Richard inspected his feet, in an awkward sort of way. "There's nothing to be sorry 
about," he said, and added, doubtfully, "it was fun." Then he looked up again. 
But there was nobody there. 

THREE 
On Sunday morning Richard took the Batmobile-shaped telephone he had been given 
for Christmas several years earlier by his Aunt Maude out of the drawer at the bottom 
of the closet and plugged it into the wall. He tried telephoning Jessica, but without 
success. Her answering machine was turned off, as was her cellular phone. He 
supposed she had gone back to her parents' house in the country, and he had no desire 
to phone her there. Richard found Jessica's parents deeply intimidating, each in their 
separate ways. Neither of them had entirely approved of him as a future son-in-law: in 
fact, her mother had, on one occasion, mentioned to him quite casually how 
disappointed they were by Richard and Jessica's engagement, and her conviction that 
Jessica could, if she wanted to, do so much better. 
Richard's own parents were both dead. His father had died quite suddenly when 
Richard was still a small boy, of a heart attack. His mother died very slowly after that, 
and once Richard left home she simply faded away: six months after he moved to 
London he took the train back up to Scotland, to spend her last two days in a small 
county hospital sitting beside her bed. Sometimes she had known him; at other times 
she had called him by his father's name. 
Richard sat on his couch, and he brooded. The events of the previous two days 
became less and less real, increasingly less likely. What was real was the message that 
Jessica had left on his machine, telling him she did not want to see him again. He 
played it, and replayed it, that Sunday, hoping each time that she would relent, that he'd 
hear warmth in her voice. He never did. 
He thought about going out and buying a Sunday paper but decided not to. Arnold 
Stockton, Jessica's boss, a many-chinned, self-made caricature of a man, owned all the 
Sunday papers that Rupert Murdoch had failed to buy. His own papers talked about 
him, and so did the rest. Reading a Sunday paper would, Richard suspected, probably 
end up reminding him of the dinner he had failed to attend on Friday night. So instead 
Richard had a long hot bath and a number of sandwiches, and several cups of tea. He 
watched a little Sunday afternoon television and constructed conversations with Jessica 
in his head. At the end of each mental dialogue they would fall into each other's arms, 
make wild, angry, tear-stained and passionate love; and then everything would be all 
right. 
  
On Monday morning Richard's alarm failed to go off. He came out onto the street 
at a run at ten to nine, briefcase swinging, staring up and down the road like a madman, 
praying for a taxi. Then he sighed with relief, because a big black car was heading 
down the road toward him, its yellow "taxi" sign bright. He waved at it and yelled. 
The taxi slid gently past him, ignoring him completely; it turned a corner and was 
gone. 
Another taxi. Another yellow light that meant the taxi was available. This time 
Richard stepped out into the middle of the road to flag it down. It swerved past him and 
continued on its way. Richard began to swear under his breath. Then he ran for the 
nearest Tube station. 

He pulled out a pocketful of coins, stabbed the button of the ticket machine for a 
single ticket to Charing Cross, and thumbed his change into the slot. Every coin he put 
in went straight through the guts of the machine and clattered into the tray at the 
bottom. No ticket appeared. He tried another ticket machine, with the same lack of 
result. And another. The ticket seller in the office was speaking to someone on the 
telephone when Richard went over to complain and to buy his ticket manually; and 
despite—or perhaps because of—Richard's cries of "Hey!" and "Excuse me!" and his 
desperate tapping on the plastic barrier with a coin, the man remained resolutely on the 
telephone. 
"Fuck it," announced Richard, and he vaulted the barrier. No one stopped him; no 
one seemed to care. He ran, breathless and sweating, down the escalator, and made it 
onto the crowded platform just as a train came in. 
As a child, Richard had had nightmares in which he simply wasn't there, in which, 
no matter how much noise he made, no matter what he did, nobody ever noticed him at 
all. He began to feel like that now, as people pushed in front of him; he was buffeted by 
the crowd, pushed this way and that by commuters getting off, by others getting on. 
He persisted, pushing and shoving in his turn, until he was almost on the train—he 
had one arm inside—when the doors began to hiss closed. He pulled his hand back, but 
his coat-sleeve was trapped. Richard began to hammer on the door, and to shout, 
expecting the driver at least to open the door enough for him to free his sleeve. But 
instead the train began to move off, and Richard was forced to run down the platform, 
stumbling, faster and faster. He dropped his briefcase onto the platform, pulled 
desperately at his sleeve with his free hand. The sleeve ripped, and he fell forward, 
scraping his hand on the platform, ripping his trousers at the knee. Richard climbed, a 
little unsteadily, to his feet, then walked back down the platform and retrieved his 
briefcase. 
He looked at his ripped sleeve and his grazed hand and his torn trousers. Then he 
walked up the stone stairs and out of the Underground station. Nobody asked him for a 
ticket on the way out. 
  
"I'm sorry I'm late," said Richard, to no one in particular in the crowded office. 
The clock on the office wall said that it was 10:30. He dropped his briefcase on his 
chair, wiped the sweat from his face with his handkerchief. "You wouldn't believe what 
it was like getting here," he continued. "It was a nightmare." 
He looked down at his desktop. There was something missing. Or, more precisely, 
there was everything missing. "Where are my things?" he asked the room, a little more 
loudly. "Where is my telephone? Where are my trolls?" 
He checked the desk drawers. They were empty too: not even a Mars bar wrapper 
or a twisted paper clip to show that Richard had ever been there. Sylvia was coming 
toward him, in conversation with two rather hefty gentlemen. Richard walked over to 
her. "Sylvia? What's going on?" 
"I'm sorry?" said Sylvia, politely. She pointed the desk out to the hefty gentlemen, 
who each took an end of it, and began to carry it out of the office. "Careful now," she 
told them. 

"My desk. Where are they taking it?" 
Sylvia stared at him, gently puzzled. "And you are . . . ?" 
/ don't need this shit, thought Richard. "Richard," he said, sarcastically. "Richard 
Mayhew." 
"Ah," said Sylvia. Then her attention slid off Richard, like water off an oiled duck, 
and she said, "No, not over there. For heaven's sakes," to the removal men, and hurried 
after them as they carried off Richard's desk. 
Richard watched her go. Then he walked through the office until he got to Gary's 
workstation. Gary was answering e-mail. Richard looked at the screen: the e-mail Gary 
seemed to be writing was both sexually explicit and addressed to someone who was not 
Gary's girlfriend. Embarrassed, Richard moved around to the other side of the desk. 
"Gary. What's going on? Is this a joke or something?" 
Gary looked around, as if he had heard something. He flicked the keyboard, 
activating a screen-saver of dancing hippopotami, then he shook his head as if to clear 
it, picked up the telephone, and began to dial. Richard slammed his hand down on the 
phone, cutting Gary off. 
"Look, this isn't funny. I don't know what everyone's playing at." Finally, to his 
enormous relief, Gary looked up at him. Richard continued, "If I've been fired then just 
tell me I've been fired, but all this pretending I'm not here . . . " 
And then Gary smiled and said, "Hi. Yeah. I'm Gary Perunu. Can I help you?" 
"I don't think so," said Richard, coldly, and he walked out of the office, leaving his 
briefcase behind him. 
  
Richard's offices were on the third floor of a big, old, drafty building, just off the 
Strand. Jessica worked about halfway up a large crystalline, mirrored structure in the 
City of London, fifteen minutes' walk up the road. 
Richard jogged up that road. He got to the Stockton building in ten minutes, 
walked straight past the uniformed security guards on duty on the ground floor, stepped 
into the elevator, and went up. The inside of the elevator was mirrored, and he stared at 
himself as he went up. His tie was half-undone and askew, his coat was ripped, his 
pants torn, his hair was a sweaty mess . . . God, he looked awful. 
There was a fluting tone, and the elevator door opened. Jessica's floor was quite 
opulent, in an underdecorated sort of way. There was a receptionist by the elevator, a 
poised and elegant creature who looked like her take-home pay beat Richard's hands 
down. She was reading Cosmopolitan. She did not look up as Richard came over. 
"I need to talk to Jessica Bartram," said Richard. "It's important. I have to speak 
with her." 
The receptionist ignored him, intent upon examining her nails. Richard walked 
down the corridor until he got to Jessica's office. He opened the door and went in. She 
was standing in front of three large posters, each advertising "Angels over England—A 
Traveling Exhibition," each with a different image of an angel on it. She turned as he 
came in, and she smiled warmly at him. 

"Jessica. Thank God. Listen, I think I'm going mad or something. It started when I 
couldn't get a taxi this morning, and then the office and the Tube and—" He showed her 
his ragged sleeve. "It's like I've become some kind of non-person." She smiled at him 
some more, reassuringly. "Look," said Richard. "I'm sorry about the other night. Well, 
not about what I did, but about upsetting you, and . . . look, I'm sorry, and it's all crazy, 
and I don't honestly know what to do." 
And Jessica nodded, and continued to smile sympathetically, and then she said, 
"You're going to think I'm absolutely awful, but I have a really dreadful memory for 
faces. Give me a second, and I know I'll get it." 
And at that point, Richard knew that it was real, and a heavy dread settled in the 
pit of his stomach. Whatever madness was happening that day was really happening. It 
was no joke, no trick or prank. "It's okay," he said, dully. "Forget it." 
And he walked away, out the door and down the corridor. He was almost at the lift 
when she called his name. 
"Richard!" 
He turned. It had been a joke. Some kind of petty revenge. Something he could 
explain. "Richard . . . Maybury?" She seemed proud of herself for remembering that 
much. 
"Mayhew," said Richard, and he got into the elevator, and the doors sang a sad 
fluting downward trill as they closed behind him. 
  
Richard walked back to his flat, upset and confused and angry. Sometimes he 
would wave at taxis, but never with any real hope that they would stop, and none of 
them did. His feet hurt, and his eyes stung, and he knew that soon enough he would 
wake up from today and a proper Monday, a sensible Monday, a decent, honest 
Monday would begin. 
When he reached the apartment, he filled the bathtub with hot water, abandoned 
his clothes on the bed, and, naked, walked through the hall and climbed into the 
relaxing waters. He had almost dozed off when he heard a key turn, a door open and 
close, and a smooth male voice say, "Of course, you're the first I've shown around 
today, but I've got a list of people as long as your arm who are interested." 
"It's not as large as I imagined, from the details your office sent us," said a woman. 
"It's compact, yes. But I like to think of that as a virtue." 
Richard had not bothered locking the bathroom door. He was, after all, the only 
person there. 
A gruffer, rougher male voice said, "Thought you said it was an unfurnished 
apartment. Looks pretty damned furnished to me." 
"The previous tenant must have left some of his accoutrements behind. Funny. 
They never told me anything about that." 
Richard stood up in the bathtub. Then, because he was naked, and the people could 
walk in at any moment, he sat back down. Rather desperately, he looked around the 
bathroom for a towel. "Oh look, George," said the woman in the hallway. "Someone's 
left a towel on this chair." 

Richard inspected and rejected as poor towel substitutes a loofah, a half-empty 
bottle of shampoo, and a small yellow rubber duck. "What's the bathroom like?" asked 
the woman. Richard grabbed a washcloth and draped it in front of his crotch. Then he 
stood up, with his back to the wall, and prepared to be mortified. The door was pushed 
open. Three people walked into the bathroom: a young man in a camel-hair coat, and a 
middle-aged couple. Richard wondered if they were as embarrassed as he was. 
"It's a bit small," said the woman. 
"Compact," corrected the camel-hair coat, smoothly. "Easy to take care of." The 
woman ran her finger along the side of the sink and wrinkled her nose. "I think we've 
seen it all," said the middle-aged man. They walked out of the bathroom. 
"It would be very convenient for everything," said the woman. A conversation 
continued in lower tones. Richard climbed out of the bath and edged over to the door. 
He spotted the towel on the chair in the hall, and he leaned out and grabbed it. "We'll 
take it," said the woman. 
"You will?" said the camel-hair coat. 
"It's just what we want," she explained. "Or it will be, once we've made it homey. 
Could it be ready for Wednesday?" 
"Of course. We'll have all of this rubbish cleaned out of here tomorrow, no 
problem." 
Richard, cold and dripping and wrapped in his towel, glared at them from the 
doorway. "It's not rubbish," he said. "It's my stuff." 
"We'll pick up the keys from your office, then." 
"Excuse me," said Richard, plaintively. "I live here." 
They pushed past Richard on their way to the front door. "Pleasure doing business 
with you," said the camel-hair coat. 
"Can you . . . can any of you hear me? This is my apartment. I live here." 
"If you fax contract details to my office—" said the gruff man, then the door 
slammed behind them and Richard stood in the hallway of what used to be his 
apartment. He shivered, in the silence, from the cold. "This," announced Richard to the 
world, in direct defiance of the evidence of his senses, "is not happening." The 
Batphone shrilled, and its headlights flashed. Richard picked it up, warily. "Hello?" 
The line hissed and crackled as if the call were coming from a long way away. The 
voice at the other end of the phone was unfamiliar. "Mister Mayhew?" it said. "Mister 
Richard Mayhew?" 
"Yes," he said. And then, delighted, "You can hear me. Oh thank God. Who is 
this?" 
"My associate and I met you on Saturday, Mister Mayhew. I was enquiring as to 
the whereabouts of a certain young lady. Do you remember?" The tones were oily, 
nasty, foxy. 
"Oh. Yes. It's you." 
"Mister Mayhew. You said Door wasn't with you. We have reason to believe that 
you were embroidering the truth more than perhaps a little." 
"Well, you said you were her brother." 

"All men are brothers, Mister Mayhew." 
"She's not here anymore. And I don't know where she is." 
"We know that, Mister Mayhew. We are perfectly cognizant of both of those facts. 
And to be magnificently frank, Mister Mayhew—and I'm sure you want me to be frank, 
don't you?—were I you, I would no longer worry about the young lady. Her days are 
numbered, and the number in question isn't even in the double digits." 
"Why are you calling me?" 
"Mister Mayhew," said Mr. Croup, helpfully, "do you know what your own liver 
tastes like?" Richard was silent. "Because Mister Vandemar has promised me that he's 
personally going to cut it out and stuff it into your mouth before he slits your sad little 
throat. So you'll find out, won't you?" 
"I'm calling the police. You can't threaten me like this." 
"Mister Mayhew. You can call anyone you wish. But I'd hate you to think we were 
making a threat. Neither myself nor Mister Vandemar make threats, do we Mister 
Vandemar?" 
"No? Then what the hell are you doing?" 
"We're making a promise," said Mr. Croup through the static and the echo and the 
hiss. "And we do know where you live." And he hung up. 
Richard held the phone tightly, staring at it, then he stabbed the nine key three 
times: Fire, Police, and Ambulance. "Emergency services," said the emergency 
operator. "What service do you require?" 
"Can you put me through to the police, please? A man just threatened to kill me, 
and I don't think he was joking." 
There was a pause. He hoped he was being put through to the police. After a few 
moments, the voice said, "Emergency services. Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?" 
And then Richard put down the phone, went into his bedroom, and put his clothes on, 
because he was cold and naked and scared, and there wasn't really anything else he 
could do. 
Eventually, and after some deliberation, he took the black sports bag from under 
the bed and put socks into it. Underpants. Some T-shirts. His passport. His wallet. He 
was wearing jeans, sneakers, a thick sweater. He remembered the way the girl who 
called herself Door had said good-bye. The way she had paused, the way she had said 
she was sorry . . .  
"You knew," he said to the empty apartment. "You knew this would happen." He 
went into the kitchen, took some fruit from the bowl, put that into the bag. Then he 
zipped it up and walked out onto the darkened street. 
  
The ATM took his card with a whirr. PLEASE ENTER YOUR PIN NUMBER, it said. 
Richard typed in his secret pin number (D-I-C-K). The screen went blank. PLEASE 
WAIT, it said, and the screen went blank. Somewhere in the depths of the machine 
something grumbled and growled. 
THIS CARD IS NOT VALID. PLEASE CONTACT CARD ISSUER. There was a chunking 
noise, and the card slid out again. 

"Spare any change?" said a tired voice from behind him. Richard turned: the man 
was short and old and balding, his scraggly beard a matted tangle of yellow and gray. 
The lines of his face were etched deeply in black dirt. He wore a filthy coat over the 
ruin of a dark gray sweater. His eyes were gray as well, and rheumy. 
Richard handed the man his card. "Here," he said. "Keep it. There's about fifteen 
hundred pounds in there, if you can get to it." 
The man took the card in his street-blackened hands, looked at it, turned it over, 
and said, flatly, "Thanks a bunch. That and sixty pence'll get me a nice cup of coffee." 
He gave Richard his card back, and began to walk down the street. 
Richard picked up his bag. Then he went after the man and said, "Hey. Hang on. 
You can see me." 
"Nothing wrong with my eyes," said the man. 
"Listen," said Richard, "have you ever heard of a place called 'The Floating 
Market'? I need to get there. There's a girl called Door . . . " But the man had begun, 
nervously, to back away from Richard. "Look, I really need help," said Richard. 
"Please?" 
The man stared at him, without pity. Richard sighed. "Okay," he said. "I'm sorry I 
troubled you." He turned away, and, clenching the handle of his bag in both hands so 
that they hardly shook at all, he began to walk down the High Street. 
"Oy," hissed the man. Richard looked back at him. He was beckoning. "Come on, 
down here, quickly man." The man hurried down some steps on the derelict houses at 
the side of the road—garbage-strewn steps, leading down to abandoned basement 
apartments. Richard stumbled after him. At the bottom of the steps was a door, which 
the man pushed open. He waited for Richard to go through, and shut the door behind 
them. Through the door, they were in darkness. There was a scratch, and the noise of a 
match flaring into life: the man touched the match to the wick of an old railwayman's 
lamp, which caught, casting slightly less light than the match had, and they walked 
together through a dark place. 
It smelled musty, of damp and old brick, of rot and the dark. "Where are we?" 
Richard whispered. His guide shushed him to silence. They reached another door set in 
a wall. The man rapped on it rhythmically. There was a pause, and then the door swung 
open. 
For a moment, Richard was blinded by the sudden light. He was standing in a 
huge, vaulted room, an underground hall, filled with firelight and smoke. Small fires 
burned around the room. Shadowy people stood by the flames, roasting small animals 
on spits. People scurried from fire to fire. It reminded him of Hell—or rather, the way 
that he had thought of Hell, as a schoolboy. The smoke irritated his lungs, and he 
coughed. A hundred eyes turned, then, and stared at him: a hundred eyes, unblinking 
and unfriendly. 
A man scuttled toward them. He had long hair, a patchy brown beard, and his 
ragged clothes were trimmed with fur—orange-and-white-and-black fur, like the coat 
of a calico cat. He would have been taller than Richard, but he walked with a 
pronounced stoop, his hands held up at his chest, fingers pressed together. "What? 

What is it? What is this?" he asked Richard's guide. "Who've you brought us, Iliaster? 
Talk-talk-talk." 
"He's from the Upside," said the guide. (Iliaster? thought Richard.) "Was asking 
about the Lady Door. And the Floating Market. Brought him to you, Lord Rat-speaker. 
Figured you'd know what to do with him." There were now more than a dozen of the 
fur-trimmed people standing around them, women and men, and even a few children. 
They moved in scurries: moments of stillness, followed by hasty dashes toward 
Richard. 
The Lord Rat-speaker reached inside his fur-trimmed rags and pulled out a 
wicked-looking sliver of glass, about eight inches long. Some poorly cured fur had been 
tied around the bottom half of it to form an improvised grip. Firelight glinted from the 
glass blade. The Lord Rat-speaker put the shard to Richard's throat. "Oh yes. Yes-yes-
yes," he cluttered, excitedly. "I know exactly what to do with him." 

FOUR 
Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had set up their home in the cellar of a Victorian 
hospital, closed down ten years earlier because of National Health Service budget 
cutbacks. The property developers, who had announced their intention of turning the 
hospital into an unparalleled block of unique luxury-living accommodations, had faded 
away as soon as the hospital had been closed, and so it stood there, year after year, gray 
and empty and unwanted, its windows boarded up, its doors padlocked shut. The roof 
was rotten, and rain dripped through the empty hospital's interior, spreading damp and 
decay through the building. The hospital was ranged around a central well, which let in 
a certain amount of gray and unfriendly light. 
The basement world beneath the empty hospital wards comprised more than a 
hundred tiny rooms, some of them empty, others containing abandoned hospital 
supplies. One room held a squat, giant metal furnace, while the next room housed the 
blocked and waterless toilets and showers. Most of the basement floors were covered 
with a thin layer of oily rainwater, which reflected the darkness and the decay back 
toward the rotting ceilings. 
If you were to walk down the hospital steps, as far down as you could go, through 
the abandoned shower rooms, past the staff toilets, past a room filled with broken glass, 
where the ceiling had collapsed entirely, leaving it open to the stairwell above, you 
would reach a small, rusting iron staircase, from which the once-white paint was 
peeling in long, damp strips. And if you went down the staircase, and traversed the 
marshy place at the bottom of the steps, and pushed your way through a half-decayed 
wooden door, you would find yourself in the sub-cellar, a huge room in which a 
hundred and twenty years of hospital waste had accumulated, been abandoned, and, 
eventually, forgotten; and it was here that Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had, for the 
present, made their home. The walls were damp, and water dripped from the ceiling. 
Odd things moldered in corners: some of them had once been alive. 
Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were killing time. Mr. Vandemar had obtained from 
somewhere a centipede—a reddish orange creature, almost eight inches long, with 
vicious, poisonous fangs—and was letting it run over his hands, watching it as it twined 
between his fingers, vanished up one sleeve, appeared a minute later out of the other. 
Mr. Croup was playing with razor blades. He had found, in a corner, a whole box of 
fifty-year-old razor blades, wrapped in wax paper, and he had been trying to think of 
things to do with them. 
"If I might have your attention, Mister Vandemar," he said, at length. "Pipe your 
beady eyes on this." 
Mr. Vandemar held the centipede's head delicately between a huge thumb and a 
massive forefinger to stop it wriggling. He looked at Mr. Croup. 
Mr. Croup put his left hand against a wall, fingers spread. He took five razor 
blades in his right hand, took careful aim, and threw them at the wall. Each blade stuck 
into the wall, between Mr. Croup's fingers; it was like a top knife-thrower's act in 
miniature. Mr. Croup took his hand away, leaving the blades in the wall, outlining the 
place his fingers had been, and he turned to his partner for approval. 

Mr. Vandemar was unimpressed. "What's so clever about that, then?" he asked. 
"You didn't even hit one finger." 
Mr. Croup sighed. "I didn't?" he said. "Well, slit my gullet, you're right. How 
could I have been such a ninny?" He pulled the razor blades out of the wall, one by one, 
and dropped them onto the wooden table. "Why don't you show me how it should have 
been done?" 
Mr. Vandemar nodded. He put his centipede back into its empty marmalade jar. 
Then he put his left hand against the wall. He raised his right arm: his knife, wicked and 
sharp and perfectly weighted, was in his right hand. He narrowed his eyes, and he 
threw. The knife flew through the air and thudded into the damp plaster wall blade-first, 
the blade having first hit and penetrated the back of Mr. Vandemar's hand on its way. 
A telephone began to ring. 
Mr. Vandemar looked around at Croup, satisfied, his hand still pinned to the wall. 
"That's how it's done," he said. 
There was an old telephone in the corner of the room, an antique, two-part 
telephone, unused in the hospital since the 1920s, made of wood and Bakelite. Mr, 
Croup picked up the earpiece, which was on a long, cloth-wrapped cord, and spoke into 
the mouthpiece, which was attached to the base. "Croup and Vandemar," he said, 
smoothly, "the Old Firm. Obstacles obliterated, nuisances eradicated, bothersome limbs 
removed and tutelary dentistry." 
The person at the other end of the phone said something. Mr. Croup cringed. Mr. 
Vandemar tugged at his left hand. It wasn't coming free. 
"Oh. Yes, sir. Yes, indeed. And might I say how your telephonic confabulation 
brightens up and cheers our otherwise dreary and uneventful day?" Another pause. "Of 
course I'll stop toadying and crawling. Delighted to. An honor, and—what do we 
know? We know that—" An interruption; he picked his nose, reflectively, patiently, 
then: "No, we don't know where she is at this precise moment. But we don't have to. 
She'll be at the market tonight and—" His mouth tightened, and, "We have no intention 
of violating their market truce. More of waiting till she has left the market and 
scrobbling her . . . " He was silent then, and listened, nodding from time to time. 
Mr. Vandemar tried to pull the knife out of the wall with his free hand, but the 
knife was stuck quite fast. 
"That might be arranged, yes," said Mr. Croup, into the mouthpiece. "I mean it will 
be arranged. Of course. Yes. I realize that. And, sir, perhaps we could talk about—" But 
the caller had hung up. Mr. Croup stared at the earpiece for a moment, then put it back 
on its hook. "You think you're so damned clever," he whispered. Then he noticed Mr. 
Vandemar's predicament and said, "Stop that." He leaned over, pulled the knife out of 
the wall and out of the back of Mr. Vandemar's hand, and put it down on the table. 
Mr. Vandemar shook his left hand and flexed the fingers, then wiped the 
fragments of damp plaster from his knife-blade. "Who was that?" 
"Our employer," said Mr. Croup. "It seems the other one isn't going to work out. 
Not old enough. It's going to have to be the Door female." 
"So we aren't allowed to kill her any more?" 

"That, Mister Vandemar, would be about the short and the long of it, yes. Now, it 
seems that Little Miss Door has announced that she shall be hiring a bodyguard. At the 
market. Tonight." 
"So?" Mr. Vandemar spat on the back of his hand, where the knife had gone in, 
and on the palm of his hand, where the knife had come out. He rubbed at the spit with a 
massive thumb. The flesh closed, knitted, was whole again. 
Mr. Croup picked up his old coat, heavy, black, and shiny with age, from the floor. 
He put it on. "So, Mister Vandemar," he said, "shall we not also hire ourselves a 
bodyguard?" 
Mr. Vandemar slid his knife back into the holster in his sleeve. He put his coat on 
as well, pushed his hands deep into the pockets, and was pleasantly surprised to find an 
almost untouched mouse in one pocket. Good. He was hungry. Then he pondered Mr. 
Croup's last statement with the intensity of an anatomist dissecting his one true love, 
and, realizing the flaw in his partner's logic, Mr. Vandemar said, "We don't need a 
bodyguard, Mister Croup. We hurt people. We don't get hurt." 
Mr. Croup turned out the lights. "Oh, Mister Vandemar," he said, enjoying the 
sound of the words, as he enjoyed the sound of all words, "if you cut us, do we not 
bleed?" 
Mr. Vandemar pondered this for a moment, in the dark. Then he said, with perfect 
accuracy, "No." 
  
"A spy from the Upworld," said the Lord Rat-speaker. "Heh? I should slit you 
from gullet to gizzard and tell fortunes with your guts." 
"Look," said Richard, his back against the wall, with the glass dagger pressed 
against his Adam's apple. "I think you're making a bit of a mistake here. My name is 
Richard Mayhew. I can prove who I am. I've got my library cards. Credit cards. 
Things," he added, desperately. 
At the opposite end of the hall, Richard noticed, with the dispassionate clarity that 
comes when a lunatic is about to slit your throat with a piece of broken glass, people 
were throwing themselves to the ground, bowing low, and remaining on the floor. A 
small black shape was coming toward them along the ground. "I think a moment's 
reflection might prove that we're all being very silly," said Richard. He had no idea 
what the words meant, just that they were coming out of his mouth, and that as long as 
he was talking, he was not dead. "Now, why don't you put that away, and—excuse me, 
that's my bag," this last to a thin, bedraggled girl in her late teens who had taken 
Richard's bag and was roughly tipping his possessions out onto the ground. 
The people in the hall continued to bow, and to stay bowed, as the small shape 
came closer. It reached the group of people around Richard, although not a one of them 
noticed it. They were all looking at Richard. 
It was a rat, which looked up at Richard, curiously. He had the bizarre and 
momentary impression that it winked one of its little black oildrop eyes at him. Then it 
cluttered, loudly. 
The man with the glass dagger threw himself on his knees. So did the people 
gathered around them. So, too, after a moment's hesitation, and a little more 

awkwardly, did the homeless man, the one they had called Iliaster. In a moment, 
Richard was the only one standing. The thin girl tugged at his elbow, and he, too, went 
down on one knee. 
Lord Rat-speaker bowed so low that his long hair brushed the ground, and he 
chittered back at the rat, wrinkling his nose, showing his teeth, squeaking and hissing, 
for all the world like an enormous rat himself. 
"Look, can anybody tell me . . . " muttered Richard. 
"Quiet!" said the thin girl. 
The rat stepped—a little disdainfully, it seemed—into the Lord Rat-speaker's 
grubby hand, and the man held it, respectfully, up in front of Richard's face. It waved 
its tail languidly as it inspected Richard's features. "This is Master Longtail, of the clan 
Gray," said the Lord Rat-speaker. "He says you looks exceeding familiar. He wants to 
know if he's met you afore." 
Richard looked at the rat. The rat looked at Richard. "I suppose it's possible," he 
admitted. 
"He says he was discharging an obligation to the marquis de Carabas." 
Richard stared at the animal more closely. "It's that rat? Yes, we've met. Actually, 
I threw the TV remote, control at it." Some of the people standing around looked 
shocked. The thin girl actually squeaked. Richard hardly noticed them; at least 
something was familiar in this madness. "Hello, Ratty," he said. "Good to see you 
again. Do you know where Door is?" 
"Ratty!" said the girl in something between a squeak and a horrified swallow. She 
had a large, water-stained red button pinned to her ragged clothes, the kind that comes 
attached to birthday cards. It said, in yellow letters, I AM 11. 
Lord Rat-speaker waved his glass dagger admonishingly at Richard. "You must 
not address Master Longtail, save through me," he said. The rat squeaked an order. The 
man's face fell. "Him?" he said, looking at Richard disdainfully. "Look, I can't spare a 
soul. How about if I simply slice his throat and send him down to the Sewer Folk . . . " 
The rat chittered once more, decisively, then leapt from the man's shoulder onto 
the ground and vanished into one of the many holes that lined the walls. 
The Lord Rat-speaker stood up. A hundred eyes were fixed on him. He turned 
back to the hall and looked at his subjects, crouched beside their greasy fires. "I don't 
know what you lot are all looking at," he shouted. "Who's turning the spits, eh? You 
want the grub to burn? There's nothing to see. Go on. Get-get away with the lot of you." 
Richard stood up, nervously. His left leg had gotten numb, and he rubbed life into it, as 
it prickled with pins and needles. Lord Rat-speaker looked at Iliaster. "He's got to be 
taken to the market. Master Longtail's orders." 
Iliaster shook his head, and spat onto the ground. "Well, I'm not taking him," he 
said. "More than my life's worth, that journey. You rat-speakers have always been good 
to me, but I can't go back there. You know that." 
The Lord Rat-speaker nodded. He put his dagger away, in the furs of his robe. 
Then he smiled at Richard with yellow teeth. "You don't know how lucky you were, 
just then," he said. 
"Yes I do," said Richard. "I really do." 

"No," said the man, "you don't. You really don't." And he shook his head and said 
to himself, marvelling, " 'Ratty.' " 
The Lord Rat-speaker took Iliaster by the arm, and the two of them walked a little 
way out of earshot and began to talk, darting looks back at Richard as they did so. 
The thin girl was gulping down one of Richard's bananas in what was, Richard 
reflected, the least erotic display of banana-eating he had ever seen. "You know, that 
was going to be my breakfast," said Richard. She looked up at him guiltily. "My name's 
Richard. What's yours?" 
The girl, who, he realized, had already managed to eat most of the fruit that 
Richard had brought with him, swallowed the last of the banana and hesitated. Then she 
half-smiled, and said something that sounded a lot like Anaesthesia. "I was hungry," 
she said. 
"Well, so'm I," he told her. 
She glanced at the little fires across the room. Then she looked back at Richard. 
She smiled again. "Do you like cat?" she said. 
"Yes," said Richard. "I quite like cats." 
Anaesthesia looked relieved. "Thigh?" she asked. "Or breast?" 
  
The girl called Door walked down the court, followed by the marquis de Carabas. 
There were a hundred other little courts and mews and alleys in London just like this 
one, tiny spurs of old-time, unchanged for, three hundred years. Even the smell of piss 
here was the same as it had been in Pepys's time, three hundred years before. There was 
still an hour until dawn, but the sky was beginning to lighten, turning a stark, leaden 
color. Strands of mist hung like livid ghosts on the air. 
The door was roughly boarded up and covered with stained posters for forgotten 
bands and long-closed nightclubs. The two of them stopped in front of it, and the 
marquis eyed it, all boards and nails and posters, and he appeared unimpressed; but 
then, unimpressed was his default state. 
"So this is the entrance?" he said. 
She nodded. "One of them." 
He folded his arms. "Well? Say 'Open sesame,' or whatever it is that you do." 
"I don't want to do this," she said. "I'm really not sure that we're doing the right 
thing." 
"Very well," he unfolded his arms. "I'll be seeing you, then." He turned on his heel 
and began to walk back the way that they had come. Door seized his arm. "You'd 
abandon me?" she asked. "Just like that?" 
He grinned, without humor. "Certainly. I'm a very busy man. Things to see. People 
to do." 
"Look, hold on." She let go of his sleeve, bit her lower lip. "The last time I was 
here . . . " she trailed off. 
"The last time you were here, you found your family dead. Well, there you are. 
You don't have to explain it anymore. If we aren't going in, then our business 
relationship is at an end." 

She looked up at him, her elfin face pale in the pre-dawn light. "And that's all?" 
"I could wish you the best of luck in your career, but I'm afraid I rather doubt 
you'll live long enough to have one." 
"You're a piece of work, aren't you?" 
He said nothing. She walked back toward the door. "Well," she said. "Come on. 
I'll take us in." Door put her left hand on the boarded-up door, and with her right hand 
she took the marquis's huge brown hand. Her tiny fingers twined into his larger ones. 
She closed her eyes. 
. . . something whispered and shivered and changed . . .  
. . . and the door collapsed into darkness. 
  
The memory was fresh, only a few days old: Door moved through the House 
Without Doors calling "I'm home," and "Hello?" She slipped from the anteroom to the 
dining room, to the library, to the drawing room; no one answered. She moved to 
another room. 
The swimming pool was an indoor Victorian structure, constructed of marble and 
of cast iron. Her father had found it when he was younger, abandoned and about to be 
demolished, and he had woven it into the fabric of the House Without Doors. Perhaps 
in the world outside, in London Above, the room had long been destroyed and 
forgotten. Door had no idea where any of the rooms of her house were, physically. Her 
grandfather had constructed the house, taking a room from here, a room from there, all 
through London, discrete and doorless; her father had added to it. 
She walked along the side of the old swimming pool, pleased to be home, puzzled 
by the absence of her family. And then she looked down. 
There was someone floating in the water, trailing twin clouds of blood behind him, 
one from the throat, one from the groin. It was her brother, Arch. His eyes were open 
wide and sightless. She realized that her mouth was open. She could hear herself 
screaming. 
  
"That hurt," said the marquis. He rubbed his forehead, hard, twisted his head 
around on his neck, as if he were trying to ease a sudden, painful crick. 
"Memories," she explained. "They're imprinted in the walls." 
He raised an eyebrow. "You could have warned me." 
They were in a huge white room. Every wall was covered with pictures. Each 
picture was of a different room. The white room contained no doors: no openings of 
any kind. "Interesting decor," acknowledged the marquis. 
"This is the entrance hall. We can go from here to any room in the House. They 
are all linked." 
"Where are the other rooms located?" 
She shook her head. "I don't know. Miles away, probably. They're scattered all 
over the Underside." 

The marquis had managed to cover the whole room in a series of impatient strides. 
"Quite remarkable. An associative house, every room of which is located somewhere 
else. So imaginative. Your grandfather was a man of vision, Door." 
"I never knew him." She swallowed, then continued, talking to herself as much as 
to him. "We should have been safe here. Nobody should have been able to hurt us. 
Only my family could move around it." 
"Let's hope your father's journal gives us some clues," he said. "Where do we start 
looking?" Door shrugged. "You're certain he kept a journal?" he pressed. 
She nodded. "He used to go into his study, and private the links until he'd finished 
dictating." 
"We'll start in the study, then." 
"But I looked there. I did. I looked there. When I was cleaning up the body . . . " 
And she began to cry, in low, raging sobs, that sounded like they were being tugged 
from inside her. 
"There. There," said the marquis de Carabas, awkwardly, patting her shoulder. 
And he added, for good measure, "There." He did not comfort well. 
Door's odd-colored eyes were filled with tears. "Can you . . . can you just give me 
a sec? I'll be fine." He nodded and walked to the far end of the room. When he looked 
back she was still standing there, on her own, silhouetted in the white entrance chamber 
filled with pictures of rooms, and she was hugging herself, and shuddering, and crying 
like a little girl. 
  
Richard was still upset about the loss of his bag. 
The Lord Rat-speaker remained unmoved. He stated baldly that the rat—Master 
Longtail—had said nothing at all about returning Richard's things. Just that he was to 
be taken to market. Then he told Anaesthesia that she was taking the Upworlder to the 
market, and that, yes, it was an order. And to stop snivelling, and to get a move on. He 
told Richard that if he, Lord Rat-speaker, ever saw him, Richard, again, then he, 
Richard, would be in a great deal of trouble. He reiterated that Richard did not know 
how lucky he was, and, ignoring Richard's requests that he return Richard's stuff—or at 
least the wallet—he led them to a door and locked it behind them. 
Richard and Anaesthesia walked into the darkness side by side. 
She carried an improvised lamp made of a candle, a can, some wire, and a wide-
mouthed glass lemonade bottle. Richard was surprised at how quickly his eyes became 
used to the near darkness. They seemed to be walking through a succession of 
underground vaults and storage cellars. Sometimes he thought he could see movement 
in far corners of the vaults, but whether human, or rat, or something else altogether, it 
was always gone by the time they reached the place it had been. When he tried to talk 
to Anaesthesia about the movements, she hissed him to silence. 
He felt a cold draught on his face. The rat-girl squatted without warning, put down 
her candle-lamp, and tugged and pulled hard at a metal grille set in the wall. It opened 
suddenly, sending her sprawling. She motioned Richard to come through. He crouched, 
edged through the hole in the wall; after about a foot, the floor stopped completely. 
"Excuse me," whispered Richard. "There's a hole here." 

"It's not a big drop," she told him. "Go on." 
She shut the grille behind her. She was now uncomfortably close to Richard. 
"Here," she said. She gave him the handle of her little lamp to hold, and she clambered 
down into the darkness. "There," she said. "That wasn't that bad, was it?" Her face was 
a few feet below Richard's dangling feet. "Here. Pass me the lamp." 
He lowered it down to her. She had to jump to take it from him. "Now," she 
whispered. "Come on." He edged nervously forward, climbed over the edge, hung for a 
moment, then let go. He landed on his hands and feet in soft, wet mud. He wiped the 
mud off his hands onto his sweater. A few feet forward, and Anaesthesia was opening 
another door. They went through it, and she pulled it closed behind them. "We can talk 
now," she said. "Not loud. But we can. If you want to." 
"Oh. Thanks," said Richard. He couldn't think of anything to say. "So. Um. You're 
a rat, are you?" he said. 
She giggled, like a Japanese girl, covering her hand with her face as she laughed. 
Then she shook her head, and said, "I should be so lucky. I wish. No, I'm a rat-speaker. 
We talk to rats." 
"What, just chat to them?" 
"Oh no. We do stuff for them. I mean," and her tone of voice implied that this was 
something that might never have occurred to Richard unassisted, "there are some things 
rats can't do, you know. I mean, not having fingers, and thumbs, an' things. Hang on—" 
She pressed him against the wall, suddenly, and clamped a filthy hand over his mouth. 
Then she blew out the candle. 
Nothing happened. 
Then he heard distant voices. They waited, in the darkness and the cold. Richard 
shivered. 
People walked past them, talking in low tones. When all sounds had died away, 
Anaesthesia took her hand from Richard's mouth, relit the candle, and they walked on. 
"Who were they?" asked Richard. 
She shrugged. "It dun't matter," she said. 
"Then what makes you think that they wouldn't have been pleased to see us?" 
She looked at him rather sadly, like a mother trying to explain to an infant that, yes 
this flame was hot, too. All flames were hot. Trust her, please. "Come on," she said. "I 
know a shortcut. We can nip through London Above for a bit." They went up some 
stone steps, and the girl pushed open a door. They stepped through, and the door shut 
behind them. 
Richard looked around, puzzled. They were standing on the Embankment, the 
miles-long walkway that the Victorians had built along the north shore of the Thames, 
covering the drainage system and the newly created District Line of the Underground, 
and replacing the stinking mudflats that had festered along the banks of the Thames for 
the previous five hundred years. It was still night—or perhaps it was night once more. 
He was unsure how long they had been walking through the underplaces and the dark. 
There was no moon, but the night sky was a riot of crisp and glittering autumn 
stars. There were streetlights too, and lights on buildings and on bridges, which looked 

like earthbound stars, and they glimmered, repeated, as they were reflected with the city 
in the night water of the Thames. It's fairyland, thought Richard. 
Anaesthesia blew out her candle. And Richard said, "Are you sure this is the right 
way?" 
"Yes," she said. "Pretty sure." 
They were approaching a wooden bench, and the moment he set eyes on it, it 
seemed to Richard that that bench was one of the most desirable objects he had ever 
seen. "Can we sit down?" he asked. "Just for a minute." 
She shrugged. They sat down at opposite ends of the bench. "On Friday," said 
Richard, "I was with one of the finest investment analyst firms in London." 
"What's a investment an' a thing?" 
"It was my job." 
She nodded, satisfied. "Right. And . . . ?" 
"Just reminding myself, really. Yesterday . . . it was like I didn't exist anymore, to 
anybody up here." 
"That's 'cos you don't," explained Anaesthesia. A late-night couple, who had been 
slowly walking along the Embankment toward them, holding hands, sat down in the 
middle of the bench, between Richard and Anaesthesia, and commenced to kiss each 
other, passionately. "Excuse me," said Richard to them. The man had his hand inside 
the woman's sweater and was moving it around enthusiastically, a lone traveler 
discovering an unexplored continent. "I want my life back," Richard told the couple. 
"I love you," said the man to the woman. 
"But your wife—" she said, licking the side of his face. 
"Fuck her," said the man. 
"Don' wanna fuck her," said the woman, and she giggled, drunkenly. "Wanna fuck 
you . . . " She put a hand on his crotch and giggled some more. 
"Come on," said Richard to Anaesthesia, feeling that the bench had started to 
become a less desirable neighborhood. They got up and walked away. Anaesthesia 
peered back, curiously, at the couple on the bench, who were gradually becoming more 
horizontal. 
Richard said nothing. "Something wrong?" asked Anaesthesia. 
"Only everything," said Richard. "Have you always lived down there?" 
"Nah. I was born up here," she hesitated. "You don't want to hear about me." 
Richard realized, almost surprised, that he really did. 
"I do. Really." 
She fingered the rough quartz beads that hung in a necklace around her neck, and 
she swallowed. "There was me and my mother and the twins . . . " she said, and then 
she stopped talking. Her mouth clamped shut. 
"Go on," said Richard. "It's all right. Really it is. Honest." 
The girl nodded. She took a deep breath, and then she began to talk, without 
looking at him as she talked, her eyes fixed on the ground ahead of her. "Well, my 
mother had me an' my sisters, but she got a bit funny in the head. One day I got home 

from school, and she was crying and crying, and she didn't have any clothes on, and she 
was breaking stuff. Plates and stuff. But she never hurt us. She never did. The lady 
from the social services came and took the twins away, an' I had to go and stay with my 
aunt. She was living with this man. I didn't like him. And when she was out of the 
house . . . " The girl paused; she was quiet for so long that Richard wondered if she had 
finished. Then she began once more, "Anyway. He used to hurt me. Do other stuff. In 
the end, I told my aunt, an' she started hitting me. Said I was lying. Said she'd have the 
police on me. But I wasn't lying. So I run away. It was my birthday." 
They had reached the Albert Bridge, a kitsch monument spanning the Thames, 
joining Battersea to the south with the Chelsea end of the Embankment, a bridge hung 
with thousands of tiny white lights. 
"I didn't have anywhere to go. And it was so cold," said Anaesthesia, and she 
stopped again. "I slept on the streets. I'd sleep in the day, when it was a bit warmer, and 
walk around at night, just to keep moving. I was only eleven. Stealing bread an' milk 
off people's doorsteps to eat. Hated doing that so I started hanging around the street 
markets, taking the rotten apples an' oranges an' things people threw away. Then I got 
really sick. I was living under an overpass in Notting Hill. When I come to, I was in 
London Below. The rats had found me." 
"Have you ever tried to return to all this?" he asked, gesturing. Quiet, warm, 
inhabited houses. Late-night cars. The real world . . . she shook her head. All fire burns, 
little baby. You'll learn. "You can't. It's one or the other. Nobody ever gets both." 
  
"I'm sorry," said Door, hesitantly. Her eyes were red, and she looked as if she had 
been vigorously blowing her nose and scrubbing her tears from her eyes and cheeks. 
The marquis had been amusing himself while he waited for her to collect herself 
by playing a game of knucklebones with some old coins and bones he kept in one of the 
many pockets of his coat. He looked up at her coldly. "Indeed?" 
She bit her lower lip. "No. Not really. I'm not sorry. I've been running and hiding 
and running so hard that . . . this was the first chance I've really had to . . . " she 
stopped. 
The marquis swept up the coins and the bones, and returned them to their pocket. 
"After you," he said. He followed her back to the wall of pictures. She put one hand on 
the painting of her father's study and took the marquis's large black hand with the other. 
. . . reality twisted . . .  
  
They were in the conservatory, watering the plants. First Portia would water a 
plant, directing the flow of the water toward the soil at the base of the plant, avoiding 
the leaves and the blossoms. "Water the shoes," she said to her youngest daughter. "Not 
the clothes." 
Ingress had her own little watering can. She was so proud of it. It was just like her 
mother's, made of steel, painted bright green. As her mother finished with each plant, 
Ingress would water it with her tiny watering can. "On the shoes," she told her mother. 
She began laughing, then, spontaneous little-girl laughter. 

And her mother laughed too, until foxy Mr. Croup pulled her hair back, hard and 
sudden, and cut her white throat from ear to ear. 
  
"Hello, Daddy," said Door, quietly. 
She touched the bust of her father with her fingers, stroking the side of his face. A 
thin, ascetic man, almost bald. Caesar as Prospero, thought the marquis de Carabas. He 
felt a little sick. That last image had hurt. Still: he was in Lord Portico's study. That was 
a first. 
The marquis took in the room, eyes sliding from detail to detail. The stuffed 
crocodile hanging from the ceiling; the leather-bound books, an astrolabe, convex and 
concave mirrors, odd scientific instruments; there were maps on the walls, of lands and 
cities de Carabas had never heard of; a desk, covered in handwritten correspondence. 
The white wall behind the desk was marred by a reddish-brown stain. There was a 
small portrait of Door's family on the desk. The marquis stared at it. "Your mother and 
your sister, your father, and your brothers. All dead. How did you escape?" he asked. 
She lowered her hand. "I was lucky. I'd gone off exploring for a few days . . . did 
you know there are still some Roman soldiers camped out by the Kilburn River?" 
The marquis had not known this, which irritated him. "Hmm. How many?" 
She shrugged. "A few dozen. They were deserters from the Nineteenth Legion, I 
think. My Latin's a bit patchy. Anyway, when I got back here . . . " She paused, 
swallowed, her opal-colored eyes brimming with tears. 
"Pull yourself together," said the marquis, shortly. "We need your father's journal. 
We have to find out who did this." 
She frowned at him. "We know who did this. It was Croup and Vandemar—" 
He opened a hand, waggled his fingers as he spoke. "They're arms. Hands. 
Fingers. There's a head that ordered it, that wants you dead, too. Those two don't come 
cheap." He looked around the cluttered office. "His journal?" said the marquis. 
"It's not here," she said. "I told you. I looked." 
"I was under the misapprehension that your family was skilled in locating doors, 
both obvious and otherwise." 
She glowered at him. Then she closed her eyes and put her finger and thumb on 
each side of the bridge of her nose. Meanwhile, the marquis examined the objects on 
Portico's desk. An inkwell; a chess-piece; a bone die; a gold pocket-watch; several 
quill-feathers and . . .  
Interesting. 
It was a small statue of a boar, or a crouching bear, or perhaps a bull. It was hard 
to tell. It was the size of a large chess-piece, and it had been roughly carved out of 
black obsidian. It reminded him of something, but of what he could not say. He picked 
it up casually, turned it over, curled his fingers around it. 
Door lowered her hand from her face. She looked puzzled and confused. "What's 
the matter?" he asked. 

"It is here," she said, simply. She began to walk through the study, head turning 
first to one side and then to the other. The marquis slipped the carving discreetly into an 
inside pocket. 
Door stood before a high cabinet. "There," she said. She reached out a hand: there 
was a click, and a small panel in the side of the cabinet swung open. Door reached into 
the darkness and removed something roughly the size and shape of a small cannon-ball. 
She passed it to the marquis. It was a sphere, constructed of old brass and polished 
wood, inset with polished copper and glass lenses. He took it from her. 
"This is it?" 
She nodded. 
"Well done." 
She looked grave. "I don't know how I could have missed it before." 
"You were upset," said the marquis. "I was certain it would be here. And I am so 
rarely wrong. Now . . . " he held the little wooden globe up. The light caught the 
polished glass and glinted from the brass and copper fittings. It galled him to admit 
ignorance about anything, but he said it anyway. "How does this work?" 
  
Anaesthesia led Richard into a small park on the south side of the bridge, then 
down some stone steps, set beside a wall. She relit her candle-in-a-bottle, and then she 
opened a workman's door and closed it behind them. They went down some steps, with 
the darkness all around them. 
"There's a girl named Door," said Richard. "She's a bit younger than you. Do you 
know her?" 
"The Lady Door. I know who she is." 
"So which, um, barony is she part of?" 
"No barony. She's of the House of the Arch. Her family used to be very 
important." 
"Used to be? Why did they stop?" 
"Somebody killed them." 
Yes, he remembered the marquis saying something about that, now. A rat cut 
across their path. Anaesthesia stopped on the steps and performed a deep curtsey. The 
rat paused. "Sire," she said, to the rat. "Hi," said Richard. The rat looked at them for a 
heartbeat, then it darted off down the steps. "So," said Richard. "What is a floating 
market?" 
"It's very big," she said. "But rat-speakers hardly ever need to go to the market. To 
tell the truth—" She hesitated. "Nah. You'll laugh at me." 
"I won't," said Richard, honestly. 
"Well," said the thin girl. "I'm a little scared." 
"Scared? Of the market?" 
They had reached the bottom of the steps. Anaesthesia hesitated and then turned 
left. "Oh. No. There's a truce in the market. If anyone hurt anyone there, the whole of 
London Below would be down on them like a ton of sewage." 

"So what are you scared of?" 
"Getting there. They hold it in a different place every time. It moves around. And 
to get to the place it'll be tonight . . . " she fingered the quartz beads around her neck, 
nervously. "We'll have to go through a really nasty neighborhood." She did sound 
scared. 
Richard suppressed the urge to put an arm around her. "And where would that 
be?" he asked. She turned to him, pushed the hair from her eyes, and told him. 
"Knightsbridge," repeated Richard, and he began to chuckle, gently. 
The girl turned away. "See?" she said. "I said you'd laugh." 
  
The deep tunnels had been dug in the 1920s, for a high-speed extension to the 
Northern Line of London's Underground Railway system. During the Second World 
War troops had been quartered there in the thousands, their waste pumped up by 
compressed air to the level of the sewers far above. Both sides of the runnels had been 
lined with metal bunk beds for the troops to sleep on. When the war ended the bunk 
beds had stayed, and on their wire bases cardboard boxes were stored, each box filled 
with letters and files and papers: secrets, of the dullest kind, stored down deep, to be 
forgotten. The need for economy had closed the deep tunnels completely in the early 
1990s. The boxes of secrets were removed, to be scanned and stored on computers, or 
shredded, or burned. 
Varney made his home in the deepest of the deep tunnels, far beneath Camden 
Town Tube. He had piled abandoned metal bunk beds in front of the only entrance. 
Then he had decorated. Varney liked weapons. He made his own, out of whatever he 
could find, or take, or steal, parts of cars and rescued bits of machinery, which he 
turned into hooks and shivs, crossbows and arbalests, small mangonels and trebuchets 
for breaking walls, cudgels, glaives and knob-kerries. They hung on the wall of the 
deep runnel, or sat in corners, looking unfriendly. Varney looked like a bull might look, 
if the bull were to be shaved, dehorned, covered in tattoos, and suffered from complete 
dental breakdown. Also, he snored. The oil lamp next to his head was turned down low. 
Varney slept on a pile of rags, snoring and snuffling, with the hilt of a homemade two-
bladed sword on the ground beside his hand. 
A hand turned up the oil lamp. 
Varney had the two-bladed sword in his hand, and he was on his feet almost 
before his eyes were open. He blinked, stared around him. There was no one there: 
nothing had disturbed the pile of bunk beds blocking the door. He began to lower the 
sword. 
A voice said, "Psst." 
"Hh?" said Varney. 
"Surprise," said Mr. Croup, stepping into the light. 
Varney took a step back: a mistake. There was a knife at his temple, the point of 
the blade next to his eye. "Further movements are not recommended," said Mr. Croup, 
helpfully. "Mister Vandemar might have a little accident with his old toad-sticker. Most 
accidents do occur in the home. Is that not so, Mister Vandemar?" 

"I don't trust statistics," said Mr. Vandemar's blank voice. A gloved hand reached 
down from behind Varney, crushed his sword, and dropped the twisted thing to the 
floor. 
"How are you, Varney?" asked Mr. Croup. "Well, we trust? Yes? In fine form, 
fetlock and fettle for the market tonight? Do you know who we are?" 
Varney did the nearest thing he could to a nod that didn't actually involve moving 
any muscles. He knew who Croup and Vandemar were. His eyes were searching the 
walls. Yes, there: the morning-star: a spiked wooden ball, studded with nails, on a 
chain, in the far corner of the room . . .  
"There is talk that a certain young lady will be auditioning bodyguards this 
evening. Had you thought of trying out for the task?" Mr. Croup picked at his 
tombstone teeth. "Enunciate clearly." Varney picked up the morning-star with his mind. 
It was his Knack. Gentle, now . . . slowly . . . He edged it off the hook and pulled it up 
toward the top of the tunnel arch . . . With his mouth, he said, "Varney's the best bravo 
and guard in the Underside. They say I'm the best since Hunter's day." 
Varney mentally positioned the morning-star in the shadows above and behind Mr. 
Croup's head. He would crush Croup's skull first, then he'd take Vandemar . . .  
The morning-star plunged toward Mr. Croup's head: Varney flung himself down, 
away from the knife-blade at his eye. Mr. Croup did not look up. He did not turn. He 
simply moved his head, obscenely fast, and the morning-star crashed past him, into the 
floor, where it threw up chips of brick and concrete. Mr. Vandemar picked Varney up 
with one hand. "Hurt him?" he asked his partner. 
Mr. Croup shook his head: not yet. To Varney, he said, "Not bad. So, 'best bravo 
and guard,' we want you to get yourself to the market tonight. We want you to do 
whatever you have to, to become that certain young lady's personal bodyguard. Then, 
when you get the job, one thing you don't forget. You may guard her from the rest of 
the world, but when we want her, we take her. Got it?" 
Varney ran his tongue over the wreck of his teeth. "Are you bribing me?" he 
asked. 
Mr. Vandemar had picked up the morning-star. He was pulling the chain apart, 
with his free hand, link by link, and dropping the bits of twisted metal onto the floor. 
Chink. "No," said Mr. Vandemar. Chink. "We're intimidating you." Chink. "And if you 
don't do what Mister Croup says, we're . . . " chink " . . . hurting you . . . " chink " . . . 
very badly, before we're . . . " chink " . . . killing you." 
"Ah," said Varney. "Then I'm working for you, aren't I?" 
"Yes, you are," said Mr. Croup. "I'm afraid we don't have any redeeming features." 
"That doesn't bother me," said Varney. 
"Good," said Mr. Croup. "Welcome aboard." 
  
It was a large but elegant mechanism, built of polished walnut and oak, of brass 
and glass, copper and mirrors and carved and inlaid ivory, of quartz prisms and brass 
gears and springs and cogs. The whole thing was rather larger than a wide-screen 
television, although the actual screen itself was no more than six inches across. A 
magnifying lens placed across it increased the size of the picture. There was a large 

brass horn coming out of the side—the kind you could find on an antique gramophone. 
The whole mechanism looked rather like a combined television and video player might 
look, if it had been invented and built three hundred years ago by Sir Isaac Newton. 
Which was, more or less, exactly what it was. 
"Watch," said Door. She placed the wooden ball onto a platform. Lights shone 
through the machine and into the ball. It began to spin around and around, 
A patrician face appeared on the small screen, vividly colored. Slightly out of 
time, a voice came from the horn, crackling in mid-speech. " . . . that two cities should 
be so near," said the voice, "and yet in all things so far; the possessors above us, and the 
dispossessed, we who live below and between, who live in the cracks." 
Door stared at the screen, her face unreadable. 
" . . . still," said her father, "I am of the opinion that what cripples us, who inhabit 
the Underside, is our petty factionalism. The system of baronies and fiefdoms is both 
divisive and foolish." The Lord Portico was wearing a threadbare old smoking jacket 
and a skullcap. His voice seemed to be coming to them across the centuries, not days or 
weeks. He coughed. "I am not alone in this belief. There are those who wish to see 
things the way they are. There are others who want the situation to worsen. There are 
those . . . " 
"Can you speed it up?" asked the marquis. "Find the last entry?" 
Door nodded. She touched an ivory lever at the side: the image ghosted, 
fragmented, re-formed. 
Now Portico wore a long coat. His skullcap was gone. There was a scarlet gash 
down one side of his head. He was no longer sitting at his desk. He was talking 
urgently, quietly. "I do not know who will see this, who will find this. But whoever you 
are, please take this to my daughter, the Lady Door, if she lives . . . " A static burst 
wiped across the picture and the sound. Then, "Door? Girl, this is bad. I don't know 
how long I've got before they find this room. I think my poor Portia and your brother 
and sister are dead." The sound and picture quality began to degrade. 
The marquis glanced at Door. Her face was wet: tears were brimming from her 
eyes, glistening down her cheeks. She seemed unaware that she was crying, made no 
attempt to wipe away the tears. She just stared at her father's image, listened to his 
words. Crackle. Wipe. Crackle. "Listen to me, girl," said her dead father. "Go to 
Islington . . . you can trust Islington . . . You must believe in Islington . . . " He ghosted. 
Blood dripped from his forehead into his eyes. He he wiped it off. "Door? Avenge us. 
Avenge your family." 
A loud bang came from the gramophone horn. Portico turned his head to look 
offscreen, puzzled and nervous. "What?" he said, and he stepped out of frame. For a 
moment, the picture remained unchanged: the desk, the blank white wall behind it. 
Then an arc of vivid blood splashed across the wall. Door flicked a lever on the side, 
blanking the screen, and turned away. 
"Here." The marquis passed her a handkerchief. 
"Thanks." She wiped her face, blew her nose vigorously. Then she stared into 
space. Eventually, she said, "Islington." 
"I've never had any dealings with Islington," said the marquis. 

"I thought it was just a legend," she said. 
"Not at all." He reached across the desk, picked up the gold pocket-watch, 
thumbed it open. "Nice workmanship," he observed. 
She nodded. "It was my father's." 
He closed the cover with a click. "Time to go to market. It starts soon. Mister 
Time is not our friend." 
She blew her nose once more, put her hands deep into the pockets of her leather 
jacket. Then she turned to him, elfin face frowning, odd-colored eyes bright. "Do you 
honestly think we can find a bodyguard who will be able to deal with Croup and 
Vandemar?" 
The marquis flashed his white teeth at her. "There's been no one since Hunter 
who'd even have a chance. No, I'll settle for someone who could give you the time you 
might need to get away." He fastened the fob of the watch chain to his waistcoat, slid 
the watch into his vest pocket. 
"What are you doing?" asked Door. "That's my father's watch." 
"He's not using it anymore, is he?" He adjusted the golden chain. "There. That 
looks rather elegant." He watched the emotions flicker across her face: quiet anger and, 
finally, resignation. 
"We'd better go," was all she said. 
  
"The Bridge isn't very far now," said Anaesthesia. Richard hoped that was true. 
They were now on their third candle. The walls flickered and oozed, the passageway 
seemed to stretch on forever. He was astonished that they were still under London: he 
was half-convinced that they had walked most of the way to Wales. 
"I'm really scared," she continued. "I've never crossed the bridge before." 
"I thought you said you'd been to this market already," he asked, mystified. 
"It's the Floating Market, silly. I told you already. It moves. Different places. Last 
one I went to was held in that big clock tower. Big . . . someone. And the next was—" 
"Big Ben?" he suggested. 
"Maybe. We were inside where all the big wheels went around, and that was 
where I got this—" She held up her necklace. The candlelight glimmered yellow off the 
shiny quartz. She smiled, like a child. "Do you like it?" she asked. 
"It's great. Was it expensive?" 
"I swapped some stuff for it. That's how things work down here. We swap stuff." 
And then they turned a corner, and saw the bridge. It could have been one of the 
bridges over the Thames, five hundred years ago, thought Richard; a huge stone bridge 
spanning out over a vast black chasm, into the night. But there was no sky above it, no 
water below. It rose into darkness. Richard wondered who had built it, and when. He 
wondered how something like this could exist, beneath the city of London, without 
everyone knowing. He felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He was, he 
realized, deeply, pathetically scared of the bridge itself. 
"Do we have to go across it?" he asked. "Can't we get to the market some other 
way?" They paused at the base of the bridge. 

Anaesthesia shook her head. "We can get to the place it's in," she said. "But the 
market wouldn't be there." 
"Huh? But that's ridiculous. I mean, something's either there or it's not. Isn't it?" 
She shook her head. There was a buzz of voices from behind them, and someone 
pushed Richard to the ground. He looked up: a huge man, crudely tattooed, dressed in 
improvised rubber and leather clothes that looked like they had been cut out of the 
inside of cars, stared back down at him, dispassionately. Behind the huge man were a 
dozen others, male and female: people who looked like they were on their way to a 
particularly low-rent costume party. "Somebody," said Varney, who was not in a good 
mood, "was in my way. Somebody ought to watch where he's going." 
Once, as a small boy walking home from school, Richard had encountered a rat in 
a ditch by the side of the road. When the rat saw Richard it had reared up onto its hind 
legs and hissed and jumped, terrifying Richard. He backed away marvelling that 
something so small had been so willing to fight something so much larger than itself. 
Now Anaesthesia stepped between Richard and Varney. She was less than half his size, 
but she glared at the big man and bared her teeth, and she hissed like an angry rat at 
bay. Varney took a step backwards. He spat at Richard's shoes. Then he turned away, 
and, taking the knot of people with him, he walked across the bridge and into the dark. 
"Are you all right?" asked Anaesthesia, helping Richard back to his feet. 
"I'm fine," he said. "That was really brave of you." 
She looked down, shyly. "I'm not really brave," she said. "I'm still scared of the 
bridge. Even they were scared. That was why they all went over together. Safety in 
numbers." 
"If you are crossing the bridge, I will go with you," said a female voice, rich as 
cream and honey, coming from behind them. Richard was not able to place her accent. 
He turned, and standing there was a tall woman, with long, tawny hair, and skin the 
color of burnt caramel. She wore dappled leather clothes, mottled in shades of gray and 
brown. She had a battered leather duffel bag over her shoulder. She was carrying a 
staff, and she had a knife at her belt and an electric flashlight strapped to her wrist. She 
was also, without question, the most beautiful woman that Richard had ever seen. 
"Safety in numbers. You're welcome to come with us," he said, after a moment's 
hesitation. "My name's Richard Mayhew. This is Anaesthesia. She's the one us who 
knows what she's doing." The rat-girl preened. 
The leather woman looked him up and looked him down. "You're from London 
Above," she told him. 
"Yes." As lost as he was in this strange other-world, he was at least learning to 
play the game. His mind was too numb to make any sense of where he was, or why he 
was here, but it was capable of following the rules. 
"Travelling with a rat-speaker. My word." 
"I'm his guardian," said Anaesthesia, truculently. "Who are you? Who do you owe 
fealty to?" 
The woman smiled. "I owe no man fealty, rat-girl. Have either of you crossed 
Night's Bridge before?" Anaesthesia shook her head. "Well. Isn't this going to be fun?" 

They walked toward the bridge. Anaesthesia handed Richard her candle-lamp. 
"Here," she said. 
"Thanks." Richard looked at the woman in leather. "Is there anything, really, to be 
scared of?" 
"Only the night on the bridge," she said. 
"The kind in armor?" 
"The kind that comes when day is over." Anaesthesia's hand sought Richard's. He 
held it tightly, her tiny hand in his. She smiled at him, squeezed his hand. And then they 
set foot on Night's Bridge and Richard began to understand darkness: darkness as 
something solid and real, so much more than a simple absence of light. He felt it touch 
his skin, questing, moving, exploring: gliding through his mind. It slipped into his 
lungs, behind his eyes, into his mouth . . .  
With each step they took the light of the candle became dimmer. He realized the 
same thing was happening to the leather woman's flashlight. It felt not so much as if the 
lights were being turned down but as if the darkness were being turned up. Richard 
blinked, and opened his eyes on nothing—nothing but darkness, complete and utter. 
Sounds. A rustling, a squirming. Richard blinked, blinded by the night. The sounds 
were nastier, hungrier. Richard imagined he could hear voices: a horde of huge, 
misshapen trolls, beneath the bridge . . .  
Something slithered past them in the dark. "What's that?" squeaked Anaesthesia. 
Her hand was shaking in his. 
"Hush," whispered the woman. "Don't attract its attention." 
"What's happening?" whispered Richard. 
"Darkness is happening," said the leather woman, very quietly. "Night is 
happening. All the nightmares that have come out when the sun goes down, since the 
cave times, when we huddled together in fear for safety and for warmth, are happening. 
Now," she told them, "now is the time to be afraid of the dark." Richard knew that 
something was about to creep over his face. He closed his eyes: it made no difference to 
what he saw or felt. The night was complete. It was then that the hallucinations started. 
  
He saw a figure falling toward him through the night, burning, its wings and hair 
on fire. 
He threw up his hands: there was nothing there. 
Jessica looked at him, with contempt in her eyes. He wanted to shout to her, tell 
her he was sorry. 
Place one foot after another. 
He was a small child, walking home from school, at night, down the one road with 
no streetlights. No matter how many times he did it, it never got any easier, never got 
any better. 
He was deep in the sewers, lost in a labyrinth. The Beast was waiting for him. He 
could hear a slow drip of water. He knew the Beast was waiting. He gripped his spear 
. . . Then a rumbling bellow, deep in its throat, from behind him. He turned. Slowly, 
agonizingly slowly, it charged at him, through the dark. 

And it charged. 
He died. 
And kept walking. 
Slowly, agonizingly slowly, it charged at him, over and over, through the dark. 
  
There was a sputter, and a flare so bright it hurt, making Richard squint and 
stagger. It was the candle flame, in its lemonade-bottle holder. He had never known 
how brightly a single candle could burn. He held it up, gasping and gulping and shaking 
with relief. His heart was pounding and shuddering in his chest. 
"We would appear to have crossed successfully," said the leather woman. 
Richard's heart was pounding in his chest so hard that, for a few moments, he was 
unable to talk. He forced himself to breathe slowly, to calm down. They were in a large 
anteroom, exactly like the one on the other side. In fact, Richard had the strange feeling 
that it was the same room they had just left. Yet the shadows were deeper, and there 
were after-images floating before Richard's eyes, like those one saw after a camera 
flash. "I suppose," Richard said, haltingly, "we weren't in any real danger . . . It was like 
a haunted house. A few noises in the dark . . . and your imagination does the rest. There 
wasn't really anything to be scared of, was there?" 
The woman looked at him, almost pityingly; and Richard realized that there was 
nobody holding his hand. "Anaesthesia?" 
From the darkness at the crown of the bridge came a gentle noise, like a rustle or a 
sigh. A handful of irregular quartz beads pattered down the curve of the bridge toward 
them. Richard picked one up. It was from the rat-girls necklace. His mouth opened, but 
no sound came out. Then he found his voice. "We'd better. We have to go back. She's 
. . . " 
The woman raised her flashlight, shone it across the bridge. Richard could see all 
the way across the bridge. It was deserted. "Where is she?" he asked. 
"Gone," said the woman, flatly. "The darkness took her." 
"We've got to do something," said Richard urgently. 
"Such as?" 
Once again, he opened his mouth. This time, he found no words. He closed it 
again. He fingered the lump of quartz, looked at the others on the ground. 
"She's gone," said the woman. "The bridge takes its toll. Be grateful it didn't take 
you too. Now if you're going to the market, it's through here, up this way." She gestured 
toward a narrow passageway that rose up into the dimness in front of them, barely 
illuminated by the beam of her flashlight. 
Richard did not move. He felt numb. He found it hard to believe that the rat girl 
was gone—lost, or stolen, or strayed, or . . . —and harder to believe that the leather 
woman was able to carry on as if nothing at all out of the ordinary had happened—as if 
this were utterly usual. Anaesthesia could not be dead 
He completed the thought. She could not be dead, because if she were, then it was 
his fault. She had not asked to go with him. He held the quartz bead so tightly it hurt his 

hand, thinking of the pride with which Anaesthesia had shown it to him, of how fond he 
had become of her in the handful of hours that he had known her. 
"Are you coming?" 
Richard stood there in the darkness for a few pounding heartbeats, then he placed 
the quartz bead gently into the pocket of his jeans. He followed the woman, who was 
still some paces ahead of him. As he followed her, he realized that he still did not know 
her name. 

FIVE 
People slipped and slid through the darkness about them, holding lamps, torches, 
flashlights, and candles. It made Richard think of documentary films he had seen of 
schools of fish, glittering and darting through the ocean . . . Deep water, inhabited by 
things that had lost the use of their eyes. 
Richard followed the leather woman up some steps. Stone steps, edged with metal. 
They were in an Underground station. They joined a line of people waiting to slip 
through a grille, which had been opened a foot or so to uncover the door, which led out 
onto the pavement. 
Immediately in front of them were a couple of young boys, each with a string tied 
around his wrist. The strings were held by a pallid, bald man, who smelled of 
formaldehyde. Immediately behind them in the line waited a gray-bearded man with a 
black-and-white kitten sitting on his shoulder. It washed itself, intently licked the man's 
ear, then curled up on his shoulder and went to sleep. The line moved slowly, as, one by 
one, the figures at the end slipped through the space between the grille and the wall and 
edged into the night. "Why are you going to the market, Richard Mayhew?" asked the 
leather woman, in a low voice. Richard still could not place her accent: he was 
beginning to suspect that she was African or Australian—or perhaps she came from 
somewhere even more exotic and obscure. 
"I have friends I'm hoping to meet there. Well, just one friend. I don't actually 
know many people from this world. I was sort of getting to know Anaesthesia, but . . . " 
he trailed off. Asked the question he had not dared to voice until this moment. "Is she 
dead?" 
The woman shrugged. "Yes. Or as good as. I trust your visit to the market will 
make her loss worthwhile." 
Richard shivered. "I don't think it could," he said. He felt empty, and utterly alone. 
They were approaching the front of the line. "What do you do?" he asked. 
She smiled. "I sell personal physical services." 
"Oh," he said. "What kind of personal physical services?" he asked. 
"I rent my body." She did not elaborate. 
"Ah." He was too weary to pursue it, to press her to explain just what she meant; 
he had an idea, though. And then they stepped out into the night. Richard looked back. 
The sign on the station said KNIGHTSBRIDGE. He didn't know whether to smile or to 
mourn. It felt like the small hours of the morning. Richard looked down at his watch 
and was not surprised to notice that the digital face was now completely blank. Perhaps 
the batteries had died, or, he thought, more likely, time in London Below had only a 
passing acquaintance with the kind of time he was used to. He did not care. He 
unstrapped the watch and dropped it into the nearest garbage can. 
The odd people were crossing the road in a stream, walking through the double 
doors facing them. "There?" he said, appalled. 
The woman nodded. "There." 

The building was large, and it was covered with many thousands of burning lights. 
Conspicuous coats of arms on the wall facing them proudly proclaimed that it sold all 
sorts of things by appointment to various members of the British Royal Family. 
Richard, who had spent many a footsore weekend hour trailing behind Jessica through 
every prominent shop in London, recognized it immediately, even without the huge 
sign, proclaiming it to be, "Harrods?" 
The woman nodded. "Only for tonight," she said. "The next market could be 
anywhere." 
"But I mean," said Richard. "Harrods." It seemed almost sacrilegious to be 
sneaking into this place at night. 
They walked in through the side door. The room was dark. They passed the 
bureau de change and the gift-wrapping section, through another darkened room selling 
sunglasses and figurines, and then they stepped into the Egyptian Room. Color and 
light broke over Richard like a wave hitting the shore. His companion turned to him: 
she yawned, catlike, shading the vivid pinkness of her mouth with the back of her 
caramel hand. And then she smiled, and said, "Well. You're here. Safe and, more or 
less, sound. I have business to attend to. Fare you well." She nodded curtly and slipped 
away into the crowd. 
Richard stood there, alone in the throng, drinking it in. It was pure madness—of 
that there was no doubt at all. It was loud, and brash, and insane, and it was, in many 
ways, quite wonderful. People argued, haggled, shouted, sang. They hawked and touted 
their wares, and loudly declaimed the superiority of their merchandise. Music was 
playing—a dozen different kinds of music, being played a dozen different ways on a 
score of different instruments, most of them improvised, improved, improbable. 
Richard could smell food. All kinds of food—the smells of curries and spices seemed to 
predominate, with, beneath them, the smells of grilling meats and mushrooms. Stalls 
had been set up all throughout the shop, next to, or even on, counters that, during the 
day, had sold perfume, or watches, or amber, or silk scarves. Everybody was buying. 
Everybody was selling. Richard listened to the market cries as he began to wander 
through the crowds. 
"Lovely fresh dreams. First-class nightmares. We got 'em. Get yer lovely 
nightmares here." 
"Weapons! Arm yourself! Defend your cellar, cave, or hole! You want to hit 'em? 
We got 'em. Come on darling, come on over here . . . " 
"Rubbish!" screamed a fat, elderly woman, in Richard's ear, as he passed her 
malodorous stall. "Junk!" she continued. "Garbage! Trash! Offal! Debris! Come and get 
it! Nothing whole or undamaged! Crap, tripe, and useless piles of shit. You know you 
want it." 
A man in armor beat a small drum and chanted, "Lost Property. Roll up, roll up, 
and see for yourself. Lost property. None of your found things here. Everything 
guaranteed properly lost." 
Richard wandered through the huge rooms of the store, like a man in a trance. He 
was unable to even guess how many people there were at the night market. A thousand? 
Two thousand? Five thousand? 

One stall was piled high with bottles, full bottles and empty bottles of every shape 
and every size, from bottles of booze to one huge glimmering bottle that could have 
contained nothing but a captive djinn; another sold lamps with candles, made of many 
kinds of wax and tallow; a man thrust what appeared to be a child's severed hand 
clutching a candle toward him as he passed, muttering, "Hand of Glory, sir? Send 'em 
up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire. Guaranteed to work." Richard hurried past, not 
wishing to find out what a Hand of Glory was, nor how it worked; he passed a stall 
selling glittering gold and silver jewelry, another selling jewelry made from what 
looked like the valves and wires of antique radios; there were stalls that sold every 
manner of book and magazine; others that sold clothes—old clothes patched, and 
mended, and made strange; several tattooists; something that he was almost certain was 
a small slave market (he kept well clear of this); a dentist's chair, with a hand-operated 
manual drill, with a line of miserable people standing beside it, waiting to have their 
teeth pulled or filled by a young man who seemed to be having altogether too good a 
time; a bent old man selling unlikely things that might have been hats and might have 
been modern art; something that looked very much like a portable shower facility; even 
a blacksmith's . . .  
And every few stalls there would be somebody selling food. Some of them had 
food cooking over open fires: curries, and potatoes, and chestnuts, and huge 
mushrooms, and exotic breads. Richard found himself wondering why the smoke from 
the fires didn't set off the building's sprinkler system. Then he found himself wondering 
why no one was looting the store: why set up their own little stalls? Why not just take 
things from the shop itself? He knew better, at this point, than to risk asking anyone . . . 
He seemed marked as a man from London Above, and thus worthy of great suspicion. 
There was something deeply tribal about the people, Richard decided. He tried to 
pick out distinct groups: there were the ones who looked like they had escaped from a 
historical reenactment society; the ones who reminded him of hippies; the albino people 
in gray clothes and dark glasses; the polished, dangerous ones in smart suits and black 
gloves; the huge, almost identical women who walked together in twos and threes, and 
nodded when they saw each other; the tangle-haired ones who looked like they 
probably lived in sewers and who smelled like hell; and a hundred other types and 
kinds . . .  
He wondered how normal London—his London—would look to an alien, and that 
made him bold. He began to ask them, as he went, "Excuse me? I'm looking for a man 
named de Carabas and a girl called Door. Do you know where I'd find them?" People 
shook their heads, apologized, averted their eyes, moved away. 
Richard took a step back and stepped on someone's foot. Someone was well over 
seven feet tall, and was covered in tufty ginger-colored hair. Someone's teeth had been 
sharpened to points. Someone picked Richard up with a hand the size of a sheep's head, 
and put Richard's head so close to someone's mouth that Richard almost gagged. "I'm 
really sorry," said Richard. "I—I'm looking for a girl named Door. Do you know—" 
But someone dropped him onto the floor and moved on. 
Another whiff of cooking food wafted across the floor, and Richard, who had 
managed to forget how hungry he was ever since he had declined the prime cut of 
tomcat—he could not think how many hours before—now found his mouth watering, 
and his thinking processes beginning to grind to a halt. 

The iron-haired woman running the next food stall he approached did not reach to 
Richard's waist. When Richard tried to talk to her, she shook her head, drew a finger 
across her lips. She could not talk, or did not talk, or did not want to talk. Richard found 
himself conducting the negotiations for a cottage cheese and lettuce sandwich and a cup 
of what looked and smelled like home-brewed lemonade, in sign language. His food 
cost him a ballpoint pen, and a book of matches he had forgotten he had. The little 
woman must have felt that she had got by far the better of the deal, for, as he took his 
food, she threw in a couple of small, nutty cookies. 
Richard stood in the middle of the throng, listening to the music—someone was, 
for no reason that Richard could easily discern, singing the lyrics of "Greensleeves" to 
the tune of "Yakkety-Yak"—watching the bizarre bazaar unfold around him, and eating 
his sandwiches. 
As he finished the last of the sandwiches, he realized that he had no idea how 
anything he had just eaten had tasted; and he resolved to slow down, and chew the 
cookies more slowly. He sipped the lemonade, making it last. "You need a bird, sir?" 
asked a cheery voice, close at hand. "I got rooks and ravens, crows and starlings. Fine, 
wise birds. Tasty and wise. Brilliant." 
Richard said, "No, thank you" and turned around. 
The hand-painted sign above the stall said: 
OLD BAILEY'S BIRDS AND INFORMATION 
There were other, smaller, signs scattered about: 
YOU WANTS IT, WE KNOWS IT, and YOU WON'T FIND A PLUMPER STARLING!!!! and 
WHEN IT'S TIME FOR A ROOK, IT'S TIME FOR OLD BAILEY!! Richard found himself 
thinking of the man he had seen when he had first come to London, who used to stand 
outside Leicester Square Tube station with a huge hand-painted sandwich board that 
exhorted the world to "Less Lust Through Less Protein, Eggs, Meat, Beans, Cheese and 
Sitting." 
Birds hopped and fluttered about small cages that looked as if they had been 
woven out of TV antennae. "Information, then?" continued Old Bailey, warming to his 
own sales-pitch. "Roof-maps? History? Secret and mysterious knowledge? If I don't 
knows it, it's probably better forgot. That's what I says." The old man still wore his 
feathered coat, was still wrapped about with ropes and cords. He blinked at Richard, 
then pulled on the pair of spectacles tied about his neck with string. He inspected 
Richard carefully through them. "Hang on—I knows you. You was with the marquis de 
Carabas. On the rooftops. Remember? Eh? I'm Old Bailey. Remember me?" He thrust 
out his hand, pumped Richard's hand furiously. 
"Actually," said Richard, "I'm looking for the marquis. And for a young lady 
named Door. I think they're probably together." 
The old man did a little jig, causing several feathers to detach themselves from his 
coat; this provoked a chorus of raucous disapproval from the various birds around 
them. "Information! Information!" he announced to the crowded room. "See? I told 'em. 
Diversify, I said. Diversify! You can't sell rooks for the stewpot forever—anyway, they 
taste like boiled slipper. And they're so stupid. Thick as custard. You ever eaten rook?" 

Richard shook his head. That was something he could be certain of, at any rate. 
"What'll you give me?" asked Old Bailey. 
"Sorry?" said Richard, awkwardly leaping from ice floe to ice floe in the stream of 
the old man's consciousness. 
"If'n I give ye your information. What'll I get?" 
"I don't have any money," said Richard. "And I just gave my pen away." 
He began to pull out the contents of Richard's pockets. "There," said Old Bailey. 
"That!" 
"My hankie?" asked Richard. It was not a particularly clean handkerchief; it had 
been a present from his Aunt Maude, on his last birthday. Old Bailey seized it and 
waved it above his head, happily. 
"Never you fear, laddie," he sang, triumphantly. "Your quest is at an end. Go down 
there, through that door. You can't miss them. They're auditioning." He was pointing 
towards Harrods' extensive network of Food Halls. A rook cawed maliciously. "None 
of your beak," said Old Bailey, to the rook. And, to Richard, he said, "Thank'ee for the 
little flag." He jigged around his stall, delighted, waving Richard's handkerchief to and 
fro. 
Auditioning? thought Richard. And then he smiled. It didn't matter. His quest, as 
the mad old roof-man had put it, was at an end. He walked toward the Food Halls. 
  
Fashion, in bodyguards, seemed to be everything. They all had a Knack of one 
kind or another, and each of them was desperate to demonstrate it to the world. At the 
moment, Ruislip was facing off against the Fop With No Name. 
The Fop With No Name looked somewhat like an early eighteenth-century rake, 
one who hadn't been able to find real rake clothes and had had to make do with what he 
could find at the Salvation Army store. His face was powdered to white, his lips painted 
red. Ruislip, the Fop's opponent, resembled a bad dream one might have if one fell 
asleep watching sumo wrestling on the television with a Bob Marley record playing in 
the background. He was a huge Rastafarian who looked like nothing so much as an 
obese and enormous baby. 
They were standing face to face, in the middle of a cleared circle of spectators and 
other bodyguards and sightseers. Neither man moved a muscle. The Fop was a good 
head taller than Ruislip. On the other hand, Ruislip looked as if he weighed as much as 
four fops, each of them carrying a large leather suitcase entirely filled with lard. They 
stared at each other, without breaking eye contact. 
The marquis de Carabas tapped Door on the shoulder and pointed. Something was 
about to happen. 
One moment there were two men standing impassively, just looking at each other, 
then the Fop's head rocked back, as if he'd just been hit in the face. A small, reddish 
purple bruise appeared on his cheek. He pursed his lips and fluttered his eyelashes. 
"La," he said, then stretched his rouged lips wide, in a ghastly parody of a smile. 
The Fop gestured. Ruislip staggered, and clutched his stomach. 

The Fop With No Name smirked outrageously, waggled his fingers, and blew 
kisses to several spectators. Ruislip stared angrily at the Fop, redoubling his mental 
assault. Blood began to drip from the Fop's lips. His left eye started to swell. He 
staggered. The audience muttered appreciatively. 
"It's not as impressive as it looks," whispered the marquis to Door. 
The Fop With No Name stumbled, suddenly, going onto his knees, as if someone 
were forcing him down, and fell, awkwardly, to the floor. Then he jerked, as if 
someone had just kicked him, hard, in the stomach. Ruislip looked triumphant. The 
spectators clapped, politely. The Fop writhed and spat blood onto the sawdust on the 
floor of Harrods' Fish and Meat Hall. He was dragged off into the corner by some 
friends, and was violently sick. 
"Next," said the marquis. 
The next would-be bodyguard was again thinner than Ruislip (being about the size 
of two and a half fops, carrying but a single suitcase filled with lard between them). He 
was covered in tattoos and dressed in clothes that looked like they had been stitched 
together from old car seats and rubber mats. He was shaven-headed, and he sneered at 
the world through rotten teeth. "I'm Varney," he said, and he hawked, and spat green on 
the sawdust. He walked into the ring. 
"When you're ready, gentlemen," said the marquis. 
Ruislip stamped his bare feet on the floor, sumo-like, one-two, one-two, and 
commenced to stare hard at Varney. A small cut opened on Varney's forehead, and 
blood began to drip from it into one eye. Varney ignored it; and instead appeared to be 
concentrating on his right arm. He pulled his arm up slowly, like a man fighting a great 
deal of pressure. Then he slammed his fist into Ruislip's nose, which began to spurt 
blood. Ruislip drew one long, horrible breath, and hit the ground with the sound of half 
a ton of wet liver being dropped into a bathtub. Varney giggled. 
Ruislip slowly pulled himself back to his feet blood from his nose soaking his 
mouth and chest, dripping onto the sawdust. Varney wiped the blood from his forehead 
and bared his ruined mouth at the world in an appalling grin. "Come on," he said. "Fat 
bastard. Hit me again." 
"That one's promising," muttered the marquis. 
Door raised an eyebrow. "He doesn't look very nice." 
"Nice in a bodyguard," lectured the marquis, "is about as useful as the ability to 
regurgitate whole lobsters. He looks dangerous." There was a murmur of appreciation, 
then, as Varney did something rather fast and painful to Ruislip, something that 
involved the sudden connection of Varney's leather-bound foot and Ruislip's testicles. 
The murmur was the kind of restrained and deeply unenthusiastic applause one 
normally only hears in England on sleepy sunny Sunday afternoons, at village cricket 
matches. The marquis clapped politely with the rest of them. "Very good, sir," he said. 
Varney looked at Door, and he winked at her, almost proprietarily, before he 
returned his attention to Ruislip. Door shivered. 
  
Richard heard the clapping and walked toward it. 

Five almost identically dressed, pale young women walked past him. They wore 
long dresses made of velvet, each dress as dark as night, one each of dark green, dark 
chocolate, royal blue, dark blood, and pure black. Each woman had black hair and wore 
silver jewelry; each was perfectly coifed, perfectly made up. They moved silently: 
Richard was aware only of a swish of heavy velvet as they went past, a swish that 
sounded almost like a sigh. The last of the women, the one dressed in utter black, the 
palest and the most beautiful, smiled at Richard. He smiled back at her, warily. Then he 
walked on toward the audition. 
It was being held in the Fish and Meat Hall, on the open area of floor beneath 
Harrods' fish sculpture. The audience had their back to him, were standing two or three 
people deep. Richard wondered if he would easily be able to find Door and the 
marquis: and then the crowd parted, and he saw them both, sitting on the glass top of 
the smoked-salmon counter. He opened his mouth to shout out Door's name; and as he 
did so, he realized why the crowd had parted, as an enormous dreadlocked man, naked 
but for a green, yellow, and red cloth wrapped like a diaper around his middle, came 
catapulting through the crowd, as if tossed by a giant, landing squarely on top of him. 
  
"Richard?" she said. 
He opened his eyes. The face swam in and out of focus. Fire opal-colored eyes, 
peering into his, from a pale, elfin face. 
"Door?" he said. 
She looked furious; she looked beyond fury. "Temple and Arch, Richard. I don't 
believe it. What are you doing here?" 
"It's nice to see you, too," said Richard, weakly. He sat up and wondered if he was 
suffering from a concussion. He wondered how he'd know if he was, and he wondered 
why he had ever thought that Door would have been pleased to see him. She stared 
intently at her nails, nostrils flaring, as if she did not trust herself to say anything else. 
The big man with the very bad teeth, the man who had knocked Richard over on 
the bridge, was fighting with a dwarf. They were fighting with crowbars, and the fight 
was not as unequal as one might have imagined. The dwarf was preternaturally fast: he 
rolled, he struck, he bounced, he dove; his every movement made Varney appear 
lumbering and awkward by comparison. 
Richard turned to the marquis, who was watching the fight intently. "What is 
happening?" he asked. 
The marquis spared him a glance, and then returned his gaze to the action in front 
of them. "You," he said, "are out of your league, in deep shit, and, I would imagine, a 
few hours away from an untimely and undoubtedly messy end. We, on the other hand, 
are auditioning bodyguards." Varney connected his crowbar with the dwarf, who 
instantly stopped bouncing and darting, and instantly began lying insensible. "I think 
we've seen enough," said the marquis, loudly. "Thank you all. Mister Varney, if you 
could wait behind?" 
"Why did you have to come here?" Door said to Richard, frostily. 
"I didn't really have much choice," said Richard. 

She sighed. The marquis was walking around the perimeter, dismissing the various 
bodyguards who had already auditioned, distributing a few words of praise here, of 
advice there. Varney waited patiently, off to one side. Richard essayed a smile at Door. 
It was ignored. "How did you get to the market?" she asked. 
"There are these rat people—" Richard began. 
"Rat-speakers," she said. 
"And you see, the rat who brought us the marquis's message—" 
"Master Longtail," she said. 
"Well, he told them they had to get me here." 
She raised an eyebrow, cocked her head slightly on one side. "A rat-speaker 
brought you here?" 
He nodded. "Most of the way. Her name was Anaesthesia. She . . . well, something 
happened to her. On the bridge. This other lady brought me the rest of the way here. I 
think she was a . . . you know." He hesitated, then said it. "Hooker." 
The marquis had returned. He stood in front of Varney, who looked obscenely 
pleased with himself. "Weapons expertise?" asked the marquis. 
"Whew," said Varney. "Put it like this. If you can cut someone with it, blow 
someone's head off with it, break a bone with it, or make a nasty hole in someone with 
it, then Varney's the master of it." 
"Previous satisfied employers include?" 
"Olympia, the Shepherd Queen, the Crouch Enders. I done security for the May 
Fair for a bit, as well." 
"Well," said the marquis de Carabas. "We're all very impressed with your skill." 
"I had heard," said a female voice, "that you had put out a call for bodyguards. Not 
for enthusiastic amateurs." Her skin was the color of burnt caramel, and her smile 
would have stopped a revolution. She was dressed entirely in soft mottled gray and 
brown leathers. Richard recognized her immediately. 
"That's her," Richard whispered to Door. "The hooker." 
"Varney," said Varney, affronted, "is the best guard and bravo in the Underside. 
Everyone knows that." 
The woman looked at the marquis. "You've finished the trials?" she asked. 
"Yes," said Varney. 
"Not necessarily," said the marquis. 
"Then," she told him. "I would like to audition." There was a beat before the 
marquis de Carabas said, "Very well," and stepped backward. 
Varney was undoubtedly dangerous, not to mention a bully, a sadist, and actively 
harmful to the physical health of those around him. What he was not, though, was 
particularly quick on the uptake. He stared at the marquis as the penny dropped, and 
dropped, and kept on dropping. Finally, in disbelief, he asked, "I have to fight her?" 
"Yes," said the leather woman. "Unless you'd like a little nap, first." Varney began 
to laugh: a manic giggle. He stopped laughing a moment later, when the woman kicked 
him, hard, in the solar plexus, and he toppled like a tree. 

Near his hand, on the floor, was the crowbar he had used in the fight with the 
dwarf. He grabbed it, slammed it into the woman's face—or would have, had she not 
ducked out of the way. She clapped her open hands onto his ears, very fast. The 
crowbar went flying across the room. Still reeling from the pain in his ears, Varney 
pulled a knife from his boot. He was not entirely sure what happened after that: only 
that the world swung out from under him, and then he was lying, face down, on the 
ground, with blood coming from his ears, and his own knife at his throat, while the 
marquis de Carabas was saying, "Enough!" 
The woman looked up, still holding Varney's knife to his throat. "Well?" she said. 
"Very impressive," said the marquis. Door nodded. 
Richard was thunderstruck: it had been like watching Emma Peel, Bruce Lee, and 
a particularly vicious tornado, all rolled into one and sprinkled with a generous helping 
of a mongoose killing a king cobra. That was how she had moved. That was how she 
had fought. 
Richard normally found displays of real violence unnerving. But he found 
watching this woman in action exhilarating, as if she were finding a part of him he had 
not known existed. It seemed utterly right, in this unreal mirror of the London he had 
known, that she should be here and that she should be fighting so dangerously and so 
well. 
She was part of London Below. He understood that now. And as he thought that, 
he thought about London Above, and a world in which no one fought like this—no one 
needed to fight like this—a world of safety and of sanity and, for a moment, the 
homesickness engulfed him like a fever. 
The woman looked down at Varney. "Thank you, Mister Varney," she said, 
politely. "I'm afraid we won't be needing your services after all." She got off him, and 
put his knife away in her belt. 
"And you are called?" asked the marquis. 
"I'm called Hunter," she said. 
Nobody said anything. Then Door spoke, hesitantly, "The Hunter?" 
"That's right," said Hunter, and she brushed the dust of the floor from her leather 
leggings. "I'm back." 
From somewhere a bell sounded, twice, a deep bonging noise that made Richard's 
teeth vibrate. "Five minutes," muttered the marquis. Then he said, to the remains of the 
crowd, "I think we've found our bodyguard. Thank you all very much. Nothing more to 
see." 
Hunter walked over to Door, and looked her up and down. "Can you stop people 
from killing me?" asked Door. Hunter inclined her head toward Richard. "I saved his 
life three times today, crossing the bridge, coming to the market." 
Varney, who had stumbled to his feet, picked up the crowbar with his mind. The 
marquis watched him do it; he said nothing. 
The ghost of a smile hovered about Door's lips. "That's funny," she said. "Richard 
thought you were a—" 

Hunter never found out what Richard thought she was. The bar came hurtling 
toward her head. She simply reached out a hand and caught it: it thwapped, satisfyingly, 
into the palm of her hand. 
She walked over to Varney. "Is this yours?" she asked. He bared his teeth at her, 
yellow and black and brown. "Right now," said Hunter, "we're under Market Truce. But 
if you try something like that again, I'll waive the truce, and I'll break off both your 
arms and make you carry them home in your teeth. Now," she continued, bending his 
wrist behind his back, "say sorry, nicely." 
"Ow," said Varney. 
"Yes?" she said, encouragingly. 
He spat it out as if it were choking him. "I'm sorry." She let him go. Varney 
backed away to a safe distance, plainly scared and furious, watching Hunter. When he 
reached the door to the Food Halls, he hesitated, and shouted, "You're dead. You're 
fucking dead, you are!" in a voice that hovered on the edge of tears, and then he turned, 
and he ran from the room. 
"Amateurs," sighed Hunter. 
  
They walked back through the store the way that Richard had come. The bell he 
had heard was now tolling deeply and continually. When they came upon it, he saw that 
it was a huge brass bell, suspended on a wooden frame, with a rope suspended from the 
clapper. It was being tolled by a large black man, wearing the black robes of a 
Dominican monk, and it had been set up next to Harrods' gourmet jelly bean stand. 
Impressive as the market had been to watch, Richard found the speed at which it 
was being dismantled, broken down, and put away even more impressive. All evidence 
that it had ever been there was vanishing: stalls were being taken apart, loaded onto 
people's backs, hauled off into the streets. Richard noticed Old Bailey, his arms filled 
with his crude signs and with bird cages, stumbling out of the store. The old man waved 
happily at Richard and vanished off into the night. 
The crowds thinned, the market vanished, and almost instantly the ground floor of 
Harrods looked as usual, as sedate, elegant, and clean as any time he had walked 
around it in Jessica's wake on a Saturday afternoon. It was as if the market had never 
existed. 
"Hunter," said the marquis. "I've heard of you, of course. Where have you been, all 
this time?" 
"Hunting," she said, simply. Then, to Door. "Can you take orders?" 
Door nodded. "If I have to." 
"Good. Then maybe I can keep you alive," said Hunter. "If I take the job." 
The marquis stopped. His eyes flickered over her, distrustfully. "You said, if you 
take the job . . . ?" 
Hunter opened the door, and they stepped out onto the pavement of London at 
night. It had rained while they had been at the market, and the streetlights now 
glimmered on the wet tarmac. "I've taken it," said Hunter. 

Richard stared at the glistening street. It all seemed so normal, so quiet, so sane. 
For a moment, he felt that all he needed to get his life back would be to hail a taxi and 
tell it to take him home. And then he would sleep the night through in his own bed. But 
a taxi would not see him or stop for him, and he had nowhere to go, even if one did. 
"I'm tired," he said. 
No one said anything. Door would not meet his eyes, the marquis was cheerfully 
ignoring him, and Hunter was treating him as an irrelevance. He felt like a small child, 
unwanted, following the bigger children around, and that made him irritated. "Look," 
he said, clearing his throat, "I know you are all very busy people. But what about me?" 
The marquis turned and stared at him, eyes huge and white in his dark face. 
"You?" he said. "What about you?" 
"Well," said Richard. "How do I get back to normal again? It's like I've walked 
into a nightmare. Last week everything made sense, and now nothing makes sense . . . " 
He trailed off. Swallowed. "I want to know how to get my life back," he explained. 
"You won't get it back traveling with us, Richard," said Door. "It's going to be 
hard enough for you anyway. I . . . I really am sorry." 
Hunter, in the lead, knelt down on the pavement. She took a small metal rod from 
her belt and used it to unlock the cover to a sewer. She pulled up the sewer cover, 
looked into it warily, climbed down, then ushered Door into the sewer. Door did not 
look at Richard as she went down. The marquis scratched the side of his nose. "Young 
man," he said, "understand this: there are two Londons. There's London Above—that's 
where you lived—and then there's London Below—the Underside—inhabited by the 
people who fell through the cracks in the world. Now you're one of them. Good night." 
He began to climb down the sewer ladder. Richard said, "Wait," and caught the 
sewer cover before it could close. He followed the marquis down. It smelled like drains 
at the top of the sewer—a dead, soapy, cabbagey smell. He expected it to get worse as 
he went down, but instead the smell quickly dissipated as he approached the floor of the 
sewer. Gray water ran, shallow but fast, along the bottom of the brick tunnel. Richard 
stepped into it. He could see the lights of the others up ahead, and he ran and splashed 
down the tunnel until he caught up with them. 
"Go away," said the marquis. 
"No," he said. 
Door glanced up at him. "I am really sorry, Richard," she said. 
The marquis stepped between Richard and Door. "You can't go back to your old 
home or your old job or your old life," he said to Richard, almost gently. "None of 
those things exist. Up there, you don't exist." They had reached a junction: a place 
where three tunnels came together. Door and Hunter set off along one of them, the one 
that was empty of water, and they did not look back. The marquis lingered. 
"You'll just have to make the best of it down here," he said to Richard, "in the 
sewers and the magic and the dark." And then he smiled, hugely, whitely: a gleaming 
grin, monumental in its insincerity. "Well—delightful to see you again. Best of luck. If 
you can survive for the next day or two," he confided, "you might even make it through 
a whole month." And with that he turned and strode off through the sewer, after Door 
and Hunter. 

Richard leaned against a wall and listened to their footsteps, echoing away, and to 
the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping stations of East London, 
and the sewage works. "Shit," he said. And then, to his surprise, for the first time since 
his father died, alone in the dark, Richard Mayhew began to cry. 
  
The Underground station was quite empty, and quite dark. Varney walked through 
it, keeping close to walls, darting nervous looks behind him, and in front of him, and 
from side to side. He had picked the station at random, had headed for it over the 
rooftops and through the shadows, making certain that he was not being followed. He 
was not heading back to his lair in the Camden Town deep tunnels. Too risky. There 
were other places where Varney had cached weapons and food. He would go to ground 
for a little while, until this all blew over. 
He stopped beside a ticket machine and listened, in the darkness: absolute silence. 
Reassured that he was alone, he allowed himself to relax. He stopped at the top of the 
spiral staircase and drew a deep breath. 
An oily voice from beside him said conversationally, "Varney's the finest bravo 
and guard in the Underside. Everyone knows that. Mister Varney told us so himself." A 
voice from the other side of him responded, dully, "It's not nice to lie, Mister Croup." 
In the pitch darkness, Mr. Croup expanded on his theme. "It isn't, Mister 
Vandemar. I have to say, I regard it as a personal betrayal, and I was deeply wounded 
by it. And disappointed. When you don't have any redeeming features, you don't take 
particularly kindly to disappointment, do you, Mister Vandemar?" 
"Not kindly at all, Mister Croup." 
Varney threw himself forward, and ran, headlong, in the dark, down the spiral 
staircase. A voice from the top of the stairs, Mr. Croup's: "Really," it said, "we ought to 
look upon it as a mercy killing." 
The sound of Varney's feet clattered off the metal railings, echoed throughout the 
stairwell. He puffed, and he panted, his shoulders glancing off the walls, tumbling 
blindly downwards in the dark. He reached the bottom of the steps, next to the sign 
warning travelers that there were 259 steps up to the top, and only healthy people 
should even think about attempting it. Everyone else, suggested the sign, should use the 
elevator. 
The elevator? 
Something clanked, and the elevator doors opened, magnificently slowly, flooding 
the passageway with light. Varney fumbled for his knife: cursed, when he realized the 
Hunter-bitch still had it. He reached for the machete in his shoulder sheath. It was gone. 
He heard a polite cough behind him, and he turned. 
Mr. Vandemar was sitting on the steps, at the bottom of the spiral staircase. He 
was picking his fingernails with Varney's machete. 
And then Mr, Croup fell upon him, all teeth and talons and little blades; and 
Varney never had a chance to scream. "Bye," said Mr. Vandemar, impassively, and he 
continued paring his nails. After that the blood began to flow. Wet, red blood in 
enormous quantities, for Varney was a big man, and he had been keeping it all inside. 

When Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were finished, however, one would have been 
hard put even to notice the slight stain on the floor at the bottom of the spiral staircase. 
The next time the floors were washed, it was gone forever. 
  
Hunter was in the lead. Door walked in the middle. The marquis de Carabas took 
up the rear. None of them had said a word since leaving Richard half an hour earlier. 
Door stopped, suddenly. "We can't do this," she said, flatly. "We can't leave him 
back there." 
"Of course we can," said the marquis. "We did." 
She shook her head. She had felt guilty and stupid ever since she saw Richard, 
lying on his back beneath Ruislip, at the audition. She was tired of it. 
"Don't be foolish," said the marquis. 
"He saved my life," she told him. "He could have left me on the sidewalk. He 
didn't." 
It was her fault. She knew that was true. She had opened a door to someone who 
could help her, and help her he had. He had taken her somewhere warm, and he had 
cared for her, and he had brought her help. The action of helping her had tumbled him 
from his world into hers. 
It was foolish to even think about bringing him with them. They could not afford 
to bring someone with them: she was unsure that the three of them would be able to 
take care of themselves on the journey that confronted them. 
She wondered, briefly, if it were simply the door that she had opened, that had 
taken her to him, which had allowed him to notice her, or if there were, somehow, more 
to it than that. 
The marquis raised an eyebrow: he was detached, removed, a creature of pure 
irony. "My dear young lady," he said. "We are not bringing a guest along on this 
expedition." 
"Don't patronize me, de Carabas," said Door. She was so tired. "And I think I can 
decide who comes with us. You are working for me, aren't you? Or is it the other way 
around?" Her sorrow and exhaustion had drained her of her patience. She needed de 
Carabas—she couldn't afford to drive him away— but she had reached her limit. 
De Carabas stared at her, coldly angry. "He is not coming with us," he stated, 
flatly. "Anyway, he's probably dead by now." 
  
Richard was not dead. He was sitting in the dark, on a ledge, on the side of a storm 
drain, wondering what to do, wondering how much further out of his league he could 
possibly get. His life so far, he decided, had prepared him perfectly for a job in 
Securities, for shopping at the supermarket, for watching soccer on the television on the 
weekends, for turning up the thermostat if he got cold. It had magnificently failed to 
prepare him for a life as an un-person on the roofs and in the sewers of London, for a 
life in the cold and the wet and the dark. 
A light glimmered. Footsteps came toward him. If, he decided, it was a bunch of 
murderers, cannibals, or monsters, he would not even put up a fight. Let them end it all 

for him; he'd had enough. He stared down into the dark, to the place where his feet 
should be. The footsteps came closer. 
"Richard?" The voice was Door's. He jumped. Then he studiously ignored her. If it 
weren't for you, he thought . . . "Richard?" 
He didn't look up. "What?" he said. 
"Look," she said. "You really wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for me," You 
can say that again, he thought. "And I don't think you'll be any safer with us. But. 
Well." She stopped. A deep breath. "I'm sorry. I really am. Are you coining?" 
He looked at her then: a small creature with huge eyes staring at him urgently from 
a heart-shaped, pale face. Okay, he said to himself. I guess I'm not quite ready to just 
give up and die. "Well, I don't have anywhere else to be right now," he said, with a 
studied unconcern that bordered on hysteria. "Why not?" 
Her face changed. She threw her arms around his chest and hugged him, tightly. 
"And we will try to get you back home again," she said. "Promise. Once we've found 
what I'm looking for." He wondered if she meant it, suspected, for the first time, that 
what she was offering might be impossible. But he pushed that thought out of his head. 
They began to walk down the tunnel. Richard could see Hunter and the marquis waiting 
for them at the tunnel's mouth. The marquis looked as if he had been forced to swallow 
a pulped lemon. 
"What are you looking for, anyway?", asked Richard, cheering up a little. 
Door took a deep breath, and answered after a long pause. "It's a long story," she 
said, solemnly. "Right now we're looking for an angel named Islington." It was then 
that Richard began to laugh; he couldn't help himself. There was hysteria in there, 
certainly, but there was also the exhaustion of someone who had managed, somehow, 
to believe several dozen impossible things in the last twenty-four hours, without ever 
getting a proper breakfast. His laughter echoed down the tunnels. 
"An angel?" he said, giggling helplessly. "Called Islington?" 
"We've got a long way to go," said Door. 
And Richard shook his head, and felt wrung out, and emptied, and flayed. "An 
angel," he whispered, hysterically, to the tunnels and the dark. "An angel." 
  
There were candles all over the Great Hall: candles stood by the iron pillars that 
held the roof up; candles waited by the waterfall that ran down one wall and into the 
small rock-pool below; candles clustered on the sides of the rock wall; candles huddled 
on the floor; candles were set into candlesticks by the huge door that stood between two 
dark iron pillars. The door was built of polished black flint set into a silver base that 
had tarnished, over the centuries, almost to black. The candles were unlit; but as the tall 
form walked past, they flickered into flame. No hand touched them; no fires touched 
their wicks. 
The figure's robe was simple, and white; or more than white. A color, or an 
absence of all colors, so bright as to be startling. Its feet were bare on the cold rock 
floor of the Great Hall. Its face was pale and wise, and gentle; and, perhaps, a little 
lonely. 
It was very beautiful. 

Soon every candle in the Hall was burning. It paused by the rock-pool; knelt 
beside the water, cupped its hands, lowered them into the clear water, raised them, and 
drank. The water was cold, but very pure. When it had finished drinking the water it 
closed its eyes for a moment, as if in benediction. Then it stood up, and walked away, 
back through the Hall, the way it had come; and the candles went out as it passed, as 
they had done for tens of thousands of years. It had no wings; but still, it was, 
unmistakably, an angel. 
Islington left the Great Hall; and the last of the candles went out, and the darkness 
returned. 

SIX 
Richard wrote a diary entry in his head. 
Dear Diary, he began. On Friday I had a job, a fiancee, a home, and a life that 
made sense. (Well, as much as any life makes sense.) Then I found an injured girl 
bleeding on the pavement, and I tried to be a Good Samaritan. Now I've got no fiancee, 
no home, no job, and I'm walking around a couple of hundred feet under the streets of 
London with the projected life expectancy of a suicidal fruit fly. "This way," said the 
marquis, gesturing elegantly, his filthy lace cuff flowing. 
"Don't all these tunnels look the same?" asked Richard, tabling his diary entry for 
the moment. "How can you tell which is which?" 
"You can't," said the marquis, sadly. "We're hopelessly lost. We'll never be seen 
again. In a couple of days we'll be killing each other for food." 
"Really?" He hated himself for rising to the bait, even as he said it. 
"No." The marquis's expression said that torturing this poor fool was too easy to 
even be amusing. Richard found that he cared less and less what these people thought 
of him, however. Except, perhaps, for Door. 
He went back to writing his mental diary. There are hundreds of people in this 
other London. Thousands maybe. People who come from here, or people who have 
fallen through the cracks. I'm wandering around with a girl called Door, her 
bodyguard, and her psychotic grand vizier. We slept last night in a small tunnel that 
Door said was once a section of Regency sewer. The bodyguard was awake when I 
went to sleep, and awake when they woke me up. I don't think she ever sleeps. We had 
some fruitcake for breakfast; the marquis had a large lump of it in his pocket. Why 
would anyone have a large lump of fruitcake in his pocket? My shoes dried out mostly 
while I slept. 
I want to go home. Then he mentally underlined the last sentence three times, 
rewrote it in huge letters in red ink, and circled it before putting a number of 
exclamation marks next to it in his mental margin. 
At least the tunnel they were now walking down was dry. It was a high-tech 
tunnel: all silvery pipes and white walls. The marquis and Door walked together, in 
front. Richard tended to stay a couple of paces behind them. Hunter moved about: 
sometimes she was behind them, sometimes to one side of them or to the other, often a 
little way in front, merging with the shadows. She made no sound when she moved, 
which Richard found rather disconcerting. 
There was a crack of light ahead of them. "There we go," said the marquis. "Bank 
Station. Good place to start looking." 
"You're out of your mind," said Richard. He did not mean it to be heard, but the 
most sotto of voces carried and echoed in the darkness. 
"Indeed?" said the marquis. The ground began to rumble: an Underground train 
was somewhere close at hand. 
"Richard, just leave it," said Door. 

But it was coming out of his mouth: "Well," he said. "You're both being silly. 
There are no such things as angels." 
The marquis nodded, said, "Ah. Yes. I understand you now. There are no such 
things as angels. Just as there is no London Below, no rat-speakers, no shepherds in 
Shepherd's Bush." 
"There are no shepherds in Shepherd's Bush. I've been there. It's just houses and 
stores and roads and the BBC. That's all," pointed out Richard, flatly. 
"There are shepherds," said Hunter, from the darkness just next to Richard's ear. 
"Pray you never meet them." She sounded perfectly serious. 
"Well," said Richard, "I still don't believe that there are flocks of angels wandering 
about down here." 
"There aren't," said the marquis. "Just one." They had reached the end of the 
tunnel. There was a locked door in front of them. The marquis stood back. "My lady?" 
he said, to Door. She rested a hand on it, for a moment. The door opened, silently. 
"Maybe," Richard said, persisting, "we're thinking of different things. The angels I 
have in mind are all wings, haloes, trumpets, peace-on-earth-goodwill-unto-men." 
"That's right," said Door. "You got it. Angels." They went through the door. 
Richard shut his eyes, involuntarily, at the sudden flood of light: it stabbed into his head 
like a migraine. As his eyes became used to the light, Richard found, to his surprise, 
that he knew where he was: they were in the long pedestrian tunnel that links 
Monument and Bank Tube stations. There were commuters wandering through the 
tunnels, none of whom gave the four of them even a first look. The perky wail of a 
saxophone echoed along the tunnel: Burt Bacharach and Hal David's "I'll Never Fall In 
Love Again," being played more or less competently. They walked toward Bank 
Station. 
"Who are we looking for again, then?" he asked, more or less innocently. "The 
Angel Gabriel? Raphael? Michael?" 
They were passing a Tube map. The marquis tapped Angel Station with one long 
dark finger: Islington. 
Richard had passed through Angel Station hundreds of times. It was in trendy 
Islington, a district filled with antique shops and places to eat. He knew very little about 
angels, but he was almost certain that Islington's tube stop was named after a pub, or a 
landmark. He changed the subject. "You know, when I tried to get on a Tube train a 
couple of days ago, it wouldn't let me." 
"You just have to let them know who's boss, that's all," said Hunter, softly, from 
behind him. 
Door chewed her lower lip. "This train we're looking for will let us on," she said. 
"If we can find it." Her words were almost drowned out by music coming from 
somewhere nearby. They went down a handful of steps and turned a corner. 
The saxophone player had his coat in front of him, on the floor of the tunnel. On 
the coat were a few coins, which looked as if the man had placed them there himself to 
persuade passersby that everyone was doing it. Nobody was fooled. 
The saxophone player was extremely tall; he had shoulder-length dark hair and a 
long, forked dark beard, which framed deep-set eyes and a serious nose. He wore a 

ragged T-shirt and oil-stained blue jeans. As the travelers reached him, he stopped 
playing, shook the spit from the saxophone mouthpiece, replaced it, and sounded the 
first notes the old Julie London song, "Cry Me A River." 
Now, you say you're sorry . . .  
Richard realized, with surprise, that the man could see them—and also that he was 
doing his best to pretend that he couldn't. The marquis stopped in front of him. The wail 
of the saxophone trailed off in a nervous squeak. The marquis flashed a cold grin. "It's 
Lear, isn't it?" he asked. 
The man nodded, warily. His fingers stroked the keys of his saxophone. "We're 
looking for Earl's Court," continued the marquis. "Would you happen to have such a 
thing as a train schedule about your person?" 
Richard was beginning to catch on. He assumed that the Earl's Court he referred to 
wasn't the familiar Tube station he had waited in innumerable times, reading a paper, or 
just daydreaming. The man named Lear moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue. " 
'S not impossible. What'd be in it for me, if I did?" 
The marquis thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his coat. Then he smiled, 
like a cat who had just been entrusted with the keys to a home for wayward but plump 
canaries. "They say," he said, idly, as if he were simply passing the time, "that Merlin's 
master Blaise once wrote a reel so beguiling that it would charm the coins from the 
pockets of anyone who heard it." 
Lear's eyes narrowed. "That'd be worth more than just a train schedule," he said. 
"If you actually had it." 
The marquis did a perfectly good impression of someone realizing, my, it would, 
wouldn't it? "Well, then," he said, magnanimously, "I suppose you would have to owe 
me, wouldn't you?" 
Lear nodded, reluctantly. He fumbled in his back pocket, pulled out a much-folded 
scrap of paper, and held it up. The marquis reached for it. Lear moved his hand away. 
"Let me hear the reel first, you old trickster," he said. "And it had better work." 
The marquis raised an eyebrow. He darted a hand into, one of the inside pockets of 
his coat; when he pulled it out again it was holding a pennywhistle and a small crystal 
ball. He looked at the crystal ball, made the kind of "hmmm" noise that means, "ah, so 
that's where that went," and he put it away again. Then he flexed his fingers, put the 
pennywhistle to his lips, and began to play an odd, rollicking tune that leapt and twisted 
and sang. It made Richard feel as if he were thirteen years old again, listening to the 
Top Twenty on his best friend's transistor radio at school during lunch hour, back when 
pop music had mattered as it only can in your early teenage years: the marquis's reel 
was everything he had ever wanted to hear in a song . . .  
A handful of coins chinked onto Lear's coat, thrown by passers-by, who walked on 
with a smile on their faces and a spring in their step. The marquis lowered his 
pennywhistle. "I owe you, then, you old rascal," said Lear, nodding. 
"Yes. You do." The marquis took the paper—the train schedule—from Lear, and 
scanned it, and nodded. "But a word to the wise. Don't overuse it. A little goes a very 
long way." 

And the four of them walked away, down the long corridor, surrounded by posters 
advertising films and underwear, and the occasional official-looking notices warning 
musicians playing for coins to move away from the station, listening to the sob of the 
saxophone, and to the sound of money landing on a coat. 
The marquis led them to a Central Line platform. Richard walked over to the edge 
of the platform and looked down. He wondered, as he always did, which one the live 
rail was; and decided, as he always did, that it was the one farthest from the platform, 
with the large whitish porcelain insulators, between it and the ground; and then he 
found himself smiling, involuntarily, at a tiny dark gray mouse who was bravely 
prowling the tracks, three feet below him, in a mousy, quest for abandoned sandwiches 
and dropped potato chips. 
A voice came over the loudspeaker, that formal, disembodied male voice that 
warned "Mind the Gap." It was intended to keep unwary passengers from stepping into 
the space between the train and the platform. Richard, like most Londoners, barely 
heard it anymore—it was like aural wallpaper. But suddenly, Hunter's hand was on his 
arm. "Mind the Gap," she said urgently, to Richard. "Stand back over there. By the 
wall." 
"What?" said Richard. 
"I said," said Hunter, "mind the—" 
And then it erupted over the side of the platform. It was diaphanous, dreamlike, a 
ghost-thing, the color of black smoke, and it welled up like silk under water, and, 
moving astonishingly fast while still seeming to drift almost in slow motion, it wrapped 
itself tightly around Richard's ankle. It stung, even through the fabric of his Levi's. The 
thing pulled him toward the edge of the platform, and he staggered. 
He realized, as if from a distance, that Hunter had pulled out her staff and was 
smacking the tentacle of smoke with it, hard, repeatedly. 
There was a faraway screaming noise, thin and mindless, like an idiot child 
deprived of its toy. The smoke-tentacle let go of Richard's ankle and slid back over the 
edge of the platform, and it was gone. Hunter took Richard by the scruff of the neck 
and pulled him toward the back wall, where Richard slumped against it. He was 
trembling, and the world seemed suddenly utterly unreal. The color had been sucked 
from his jeans wherever the thing had touched him, making them look as if they'd been 
ineptly bleached. He pulled up the trouser leg: tiny purple welts were coming up on the 
skin of his ankle and calf. "What . . . " he tried to say, but nothing came out. He 
swallowed, and tried again. "What was that?" 
Hunter looked down at him impassively. Her face could have been carved from 
brown wood. "I don't think it has a name," she said. "They live in the gaps. I did warn 
you." 
"I've . . . never seen one before." 
"You weren't part of the Underside before," said Hunter. "Just wait by the wall. It's 
safer." 
The marquis was checking the time on a large gold pocket-watch. He returned it to 
his waistcoat pocket, consulted the paper Lear had given him, and nodded, satisfied. 

"We're in luck," he pronounced. "The Earl's Court train should be coming through here 
in about half an hour." 
"Earl's Court Station isn't on the Central Line," pointed out Richard. 
The marquis stared at Richard, openly amused. "What a refreshing mind you have, 
young man," he said. "There really is nothing quite like total ignorance, is there?" 
The warm wind began to blow. An Underground train pulled up at the station. 
People got off and other people got on, going about the business of their lives, and 
Richard watched them with envy. "Mind the Gap," intoned the recorded voice. "Stand 
clear of the doors. Mind the Gap." Door took one look at Richard. Then, apparently 
worried about what she was seeing, she walked over to him, and she took his hand. He 
was very pale, and his breath was coming shallow and fast. "Mind the Gap," boomed 
the recorded voice again. "I'm fine," lied Richard bravely, to no one in particular. 
  
The central courtyard of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar's hospital was a dank and 
cheerless place. Ragged grass grew up through the abandoned desks, rubber tires, and 
bits of office furniture. The overall impression given by the area was that a decade 
before (perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of frustration, perhaps even as a statement, 
or as performance art) a number of people had thrown the contents of their offices out 
of their windows, high above, and had left them there on the ground to rot. 
There was broken glass there, as well, broken glass in abundance. There were also 
several mattresses, some of which looked like they had at some point been set on fire. 
Grass grew up through the springs. An entire ecology had evolved around the 
ornamental fountain in the center of the well, which had for a long time been neither 
particularly ornamental nor a fountain. A cracked and leaking water pipe nearby had, 
with the aid of some rainwater, transformed it into a breeding ground for a number of 
little frogs who plopped about cheerfully, rejoicing in their freedom from any non-
airborne natural predators. Crows and blackbirds and even occasional seagulls, 
however, regarded the place as a cat-free delicatessen, specializing in frogs. 
Slugs sprawled indolently under the springs of the burnt mattresses; snails left 
slime trails across the broken glass; large black beetles scuttled industriously over 
smashed gray plastic telephones and mysteriously mutilated Barbie dolls. 
Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar had come up for a change of air. They were walking 
slowly around the perimeter of the central yard, broken glass crunching beneath their 
feet; they looked like shadows in their frayed black suits. Mr. Croup was in a cold fury. 
He was walking twice as fast as Mr. Vandemar, circling him, and almost dancing in his 
anger. At times, as if unable to contain the rage inside, Mr. Croup would fling himself 
at the hospital wall, physically attack it with his fists and feet, as if it were a poor 
substitute for a real person. Mr. Vandemar, on the other hand, simply walked. It was 
too consistent, too steady and inexorable a walk to be described as a stroll: Death 
walked like Mr. Vandemar. Mr. Vandemar watched Mr. Croup, impassively, as Mr. 
Croup kicked a sheet of glass that had been leaning against a wall. It shattered with a 
satisfying crash. 
"I, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup, surveying the wreckage, "I, for one, have 
had almost as much as I'm willing to take. Almost. Pussyfooting, trifling, lollygagging, 
shilly-shallying . . . whey-faced toad—I could pop out his eyes with my thumbs . . . " 

Mr. Vandemar shook his head. "Not yet," he said. "He's our boss. For this job. 
After we've been paid, maybe we could have some fun on our own time." Mr. Croup 
spat on the ground. "He's a worthless, conniving dunderhead . . . We should butcher the 
bitch. Annul, cancel, inhume, and amortize her." 
A telephone began to ring, loudly. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar looked around, 
puzzled. Eventually Mr. Vandemar found the telephone, halfway down a pile of rubble 
on top of a scree of water-stained medical records. Broken wires trailed from the back 
of it. He picked it up and passed it to Mr. Croup. "For you," he said. Mr. Vandemar did 
not like telephones. 
"Mister Croup here," said Croup. Then, obsequiously, "Oh. It's you, sir . . . " A 
pause. "At present, as you requested, she is walking around, free as a daisy. I'm afraid 
your bodyguard idea went down like a dead baboon . . . Varney? Yes, he's quite dead." 
Another pause. 
"Sir, I am commencing to have certain conceptual problems with the role of 
myself and my partner in these shenanigans." There was a third pause, and Mr. Croup 
went paler than pale. "Unprofessional?" he asked, mildly. "Us?" He curled his hand into 
a fist, which he slammed, hard, into the side of a brick wall. There was no change, 
however, in his tone of voice as he said, "Sir. Might I with due respect remind you that 
Mister Vandemar and myself burned down the City of Troy? We brought the Black 
Plague to Flanders. We have assassinated a dozen kings, five popes, half a hundred 
heroes and two accredited gods. Our last commission before this was the torturing to 
death of an entire monastery in sixteenth-century Tuscany. We are utterly 
professional." 
Mr. Vandemar, who had been amusing himself by catching little frogs and seeing 
how many he could stuff into his mouth at a time, said, with his mouth full, "I liked 
doing that . . . " 
"My point?" asked Mr. Croup, and he flicked some imaginary dust from his 
threadbare black suit, ignoring the real dust as he did so. "My point is that we are 
assassins. We are cutthroats. We kill." He listened to something, then said, "Well, what 
about the Upworlder? Why can't we kill him?" Mr. Croup twitched, spat once more, 
and kicked the wall, as he stood there holding the rust-stained, half-broken telephone. 
"Scare her? We're cutthroats, not scarecrows." A pause. He took a deep breath. 
"Yes, I understand, but I don't like it." The person at the other end of the phone had 
hung up. Mr. Croup looked down at the telephone. Then he hefted it in one hand and 
proceeded methodically to smash it into shards of plastic and metal by banging it 
against the wall. 
Mr. Vandemar walked over. He had found a large black slug with a bright orange 
underbelly, and he was chewing it, like a fat cigar. The slug was trying to crawl away 
down Mr. Vandemar's chin. "Who was that?" asked Mr. Vandemar. 
"Who the hell do you think it was?" 
Mr. Vandemar chewed, thoughtfully, then sucked the slug into his mouth. "A 
scarecrow man?" he ventured. 
"Our employer." 
"That was going to be my next guess." 

"Scarecrows," spat Mr. Croup, disgusted. He was moving from a red rage to an 
oily gray sulk. 
Mr. Vandemar swallowed the contents of his mouth and wiped his lips on his 
sleeve. "Best way to scare crows," said Mr. Vandemar, "you just creep up behind them 
and put your hand round their little crow necks and squeeze until they don't move 
anymore. That scares the stuffing out of them." 
And then he was silent; and from far above they heard the sound of crows flying, 
cawing angrily. 
"Crows. Family Corvidae. Collective noun," intoned Mr. Croup, relishing the 
sound of the word, "a murder." 
  
Richard waited against the wall, next to Door. She said very little; she chewed her 
fingernails, ran her hands through her reddish hair until it was sticking up in all 
directions, then tried to push it back down again. She was certainly unlike anyone he 
had ever known. When she noticed him looking at her, she shrugged and shimmied 
down further into her layers of clothes, deeper into her leather jacket. Her face looked 
out at the world from inside the jacket. The expression on her face made Richard think 
of a beautiful homeless child he had seen, the previous winter, behind Covent Garden: 
he had not been certain whether it was a girl or a boy. Its mother was begging, pleading 
with the passers-by for coins to feed the child and the infant that she carried in her 
arms. But the child stared out at the world and said nothing, although it must have been 
cold and hungry. It just stared. 
Hunter stood by Door, looking back and forth down the platform. The marquis had 
told them where to wait, and then he had slipped away. From somewhere, Richard 
heard a baby begin to cry. The marquis slipped out of an exit-only door and walked 
toward them. He was chewing on a piece of candy. 
"Having fun?" asked Richard. A train was coming toward them, its approach 
heralded by a gust of warm wind. 
"Just taking care of business," said the marquis. He consulted the piece of paper 
and his watch. He pointed to a place on the platform. "This should be the Earl's Court 
train. Stand behind me here, you three." Then, as the Underground train—a rather 
boring-looking, normal train, Richard was disappointed to observe—rumbled and 
rattled its way into the station, the marquis leaned across Richard and said to Door, 
"My lady? There is something that perhaps I should have mentioned earlier." 
She turned her odd-colored eyes on him. "Yes?" 
"Well," he said, "the earl might not be entirely pleased to see me." 
The train slowed down and stopped. The car that had pulled up in front of Richard 
was quite empty: its lights were turned off, it was bleak and empty and dark. From time 
to time Richard had noticed cars like this one, locked and shadowy, on Tube trains, and 
he had wondered what purpose they served. The other doors on the train hissed open, 
and passengers got on and got off. The doors of the darkened car remained closed. The 
marquis drummed on the door with his fist, an intricate rhythmic rap. Nothing 
happened. Richard was just wondering if the train would now pull out without them on 

it, when the door of the dark car was pushed open from the inside. It opened about six 
inches, and an elderly, bespectacled face peered out at them. 
"Who knocks?" he said. 
Through the opening, Richard could see flames burning, and people, and smoke 
inside the car. Through the glass in the doors, however, he still saw a dark and empty 
carriage. "The Lady Door," announced the marquis, smoothly, "and her companions." 
The door slid open all the way, and they were inside Earl's Court. 

SEVEN 
There was straw scattered on the floor, over a layer of rushes. There was an open log 
fire, sputtering and blazing in a large fireplace. There were a few chickens, strutting and 
pecking on the floor. There were seats with hand-embroidered cushions on them, and 
there were tapestries covering the windows and the doors. 
Richard stumbled forward as the train lurched out of the station. He reached out, 
grabbed hold of the nearest person, and regained his balance. The nearest person 
happened to be a short, gray, elderly man-at-arms, who would have looked, Richard 
decided, exactly like a recently retired minor official were it not for the tin hat, the 
surcoat, the rather clumsily knitted chain mail, and the spear; instead he looked like a 
recently retired minor official who had, somewhat against his will, been dragooned into 
his local amateur dramatic society, where he had been forced to play a man-at-arms. 
The little gray man blinked shortsightedly at Richard as Richard grabbed him, and 
then he said, lugubriously, "Sorry about that." 
"My fault," said Richard. 
"I know," said the man. 
An enormous Irish wolfhound padded down the aisle and stopped beside a lute 
player, who sat on the floor picking at a melody in a desultory fashion. The wolfhound 
glared at Richard, snorted with disdain, then lay down and went to sleep. At the far end 
of the carriage an elderly falconer, with a hooded falcon on his wrist, was exchanging 
pleasantries with a small knot of damsels of a certain age. Some passengers obviously 
stared at the four travelers; others, just as obviously, ignored them. It was, Richard 
realized, as if someone had taken a small medieval court and put it, as best they could, 
in one car of an Underground train. 
A herald raised his bugle to his lips and played a tuneless blast, as an immense, 
elderly man, in a huge fur-lined dressing gown and carpet slippers, staggered through 
the connecting door from the next compartment, his arm resting on the shoulder of a 
jester in shabby motley. The old man was larger than life in every way: he wore an eye-
patch over his left eye, which had the effect of making him look slightly helpless, and 
unbalanced, like a one-eyed hawk. There were fragments of food in his red-gray beard, 
and what appeared to be pajama pants were visible at the bottom of his shabby fur 
gown. That, thought Richard, correctly, must be the earl. The earl's jester was an 
elderly man with a pinched, humorless mouth and a painted face. He led the earl to a 
thronelike carved wooden seat in which, a trifle unsteadily, the earl sat down. The 
wolfhound got up, padded down the length of the carriage, and settled itself at the earl's 
slippered feet. Earl's Court, thought Richard. Of course. And then he began to wonder 
whether there was a baron in Barons Court Tube station, or a Raven in Ravenscourt or, 
. . .  
The little old man-at-arms coughed asthmatically and said, "Right then, you lot. 
State your business." Door stepped forward. She held her head up high, suddenly 
seeming taller and more at ease than Richard had previously seen her, and she said, 
"We seek an audience with His Grace the Earl." 

The earl called down the carriage. "What did the little girl say, Halvard?" he 
asked. Richard wondered if he was deaf. 
Halvard, the elderly man-at-arms, shuffled around and cupped his hand to his 
mouth. "They seek an audience, Your Grace," he shouted, over the rattle of the train. 
The earl pushed aside his thick fur cap and scratched his head, meditatively. He 
was balding underneath his cap. "They do? An audience? How splendid. Who are they, 
Halvard?" 
Halvard turned back to them. "He wants to know who you all are. Keep it short, 
though. Don't go on." "I am the Lady Door," announced Door. "The Lord Portico was 
my father." 
The earl brightened at this, leaned forward, peered through the smoke with his one 
good eye. "Did she say she was Portico's oldest girl?" he asked the jester. 
"Yus, your grace." 
The earl beckoned to Door. "Come here," he said. "Come-come-come. Let me 
look at you." She walked down the swaying carriage, grabbing the thick rope straps that 
hung from the ceiling as she went, to keep her balance. When she stood before the earl's 
wooden chair, she curtseyed. He scratched at his beard and stared at her. "We were all 
quite devastated to hear of your father's unfortunate—" said the earl, and then he 
interrupted himself, and said, "Well, all your family, it was a—" and he trailed off, and 
said, "You know I had warmest regards for him, did a bit of business together . . . good 
old Portico . . . full of ideas . . . " He stopped. Then he tapped the jester on the shoulder 
and whispered, in a querulous boom, loud enough that it could be heard easily over the 
noise of the train, "Go and make jokes at them, Tooley. Earn your keep." 
The earl's fool staggered up the aisle with an arthritic step. He stopped in front of 
Richard. "And who might you be?" he asked. 
"Me?" said Richard. "Um. Me? My name? It's Richard. Richard Mayhew." 
"Me?" squeaked the fool, in an elderly, rather theatrical imitation of Richard's 
Scottish accent. "Me? Um. Me? La, nuncle. Tis not a man, but a mooncalf." The 
courtiers sniggered, dustily. 
"And I," de Carabas told the jester, with a blinding smile, "call myself the marquis 
de Carabas." The fool blinked. 
"De Carabas the thief?" asked the jester. "De Carabas the bodysnatcher? De 
Carabas the traitor?" He turned to the courtiers around them. "But this cannot be de 
Carabas. For why? Because de Carabas has long since been banished from the earl's 
presence. Perhaps it is instead a strange new species of stoat, who grew particularly 
large." The courtiers tittered uneasily, and a low buzz of troubled conversation began. 
The earl said nothing, but his lips were pressed together tightly, and he had begun to 
tremble. 
"I am called Hunter," said Hunter to the jester. The courtiers were silent then. The 
jester opened his mouth, as if he were going to say something, and then he looked at 
her, and he closed his mouth again. A hint of a smile played at the corner of Hunter's 
perfect lips. "Go on," she said. "Say something funny." 
The jester stared at the trailing toes of his shoes. Then he muttered, "My hound 
hath no nose." 

The earl, who had been staring at the marquis de Carabas with eyes like a slow-
burning fuse, now exploded to his feet, a gray-bearded volcano, an elderly berserker. 
His head brushed the roof of the carriage. He pointed at the marquis and shouted, spittle 
flying, "I will not stand for it, I will not. Make him come forward." 
Halvard waggled a gloomy spear at the marquis, who sauntered to the front of the 
train, until he stood beside Door in front of the earl's throne. The wolfhound growled in 
the back of its throat. 
"You," said the earl, stabbing the air with a huge, knotted finger. "I know you, de 
Carabas. I haven't forgotten. I may be old, but I haven't forgotten." 
The marquis bowed. "Might I remind Your Grace," he said urbanely, "that we had 
a deal? I negotiated the peace treaty between your people and the Raven's Court. And in 
return you agreed to provide a little favor." So there is a raven's court, thought Richard. 
He wondered what it was like. 
"A little favor?" said the earl. He turned a deep beet red color. "Is that what you 
call it? I lost a dozen men to your foolishness in the retreat from White City. I lost an 
eye." 
"And if you don't mind my saying so, Your Grace," said the marquis, graciously, 
"that is a very fetching patch. It sets off your face perfectly." 
"I swore . . . " fulminated the earl, beard bristling, "I swore . . . that if you ever set 
foot in my domain I would . . . " he trailed off. Shook his head, confused and forgetful. 
Then he continued. "It'll come back to me. I do not forget." 
"He might not be entirely pleased to see you?" whispered Door to de Carabas. 
"Well, he's not," he muttered back. 
Door stepped forward once more. "Your Grace," she said, loudly, clearly, "de 
Carabas is here with me as my guest and my companion. For the fellowship there has 
ever been between your family and mine, for the friendship between my father and—" 
"He abused my hospitality," boomed the earl. "I swore that . . . if he ever again 
entered my domain I would have him gutted and dried . . . like, like something that had 
been gutted, first . . . like . . . " 
"Perchance—then dried a kipper, my lord?" suggested the jester. 
The earl shrugged. "It is of no matter. Guards, seize him." And they did. While 
neither of the guards would ever see sixty again, each of them was holding a crossbow, 
pointed at the marquis, and their hands did not tremble, neither with age nor with fear. 
Richard looked at Hunter. She seemed untroubled by this: she was watching it almost 
with amusement, like someone attending the theater. 
Door folded her arms and stood taller, putting her head back, raising her pointed 
chin. She looked less like a ragged street pixie; more like someone used to getting her 
own way. The opal eyes flashed. "Your Grace, the marquis is with me as my 
companion, on my quest. Our families have been friends for a long time now—" 
"Yes. They have," interrupted the earl, helpfully. "Hundreds of years. Hundreds 
and hundreds. Knew your grandfather, too. Funny old fellow. Bit vague," he confided. 
"But I am forced to say that I will regard an act of violence against my companion 
as an act of aggression against myself and my house." The girl stared up at the old man. 

He towered over her. They stood for some moments, frozen. He tugged on his red-and-
gray beard, agitatedly, then he thrust out his lower lip like a small child. "I will not have 
him here," he said. 
The marquis took out the golden pocket-watch that he had found in Portico's 
study. He examined it, carelessly. Then he turned to Door and said, as if none of the 
events around them had occurred. "My lady, I will obviously be of more use to you off 
this train than on. And I have other avenues to explore." 
"No," she said. "If you go, we all go." 
"I don't think so," said the marquis. "Hunter will look after you as long as you stay 
in London Below. I'll meet you at the next market. Don't do anything too stupid in the 
meantime." The train was coming into a station, 
Door fixed the earl with her look: there was something more ancient and powerful 
in that glance than her young years would have seemed to allow. Richard noticed that 
the room fell quiet whenever she spoke. "Will you let him go in peace, Your Grace?" 
she asked. 
The earl ran his hands over his face, rubbed his good eye and his eye-patch, then 
looked back at her. "Just make him go," said the earl. He looked at the marquis. "Next 
time . . . " he ran a thick old finger across his Adam's apple " . . . kipper." 
The marquis bowed low. "I'll see myself out," he said to the guards, and stepped 
toward the open door. Halvard raised his crossbow and pointed it toward the marquis's 
back. Hunter reached out her hand and pushed the end of the crossbow back down 
toward the floor. The marquis stepped onto the platform, turned and waved with an 
elaborate flourish. The door hissed closed behind him. 
The earl sat down on his huge chair at the end of the car. He said nothing. The 
train rattled and lurched through the dark tunnel. "Where are my manners?" muttered 
the earl to himself. He looked at them with one staring eye. Then he said it again, in a 
desperate boom that Richard could feel in his stomach, like a bass drumbeat. "Where 
are my manners?" He motioned one of the elderly men-at-arms to him. "They will be 
hungry after their journey, Dagvard. Thirsty, too, I shouldn't wonder." 
"Yes, Your Grace." 
"Stop the train!" called the earl. The doors hissed open, and Dagvard scuttled off 
onto a platform. Richard watched the people on the platform. No one came into their 
car. No one seemed to notice that anything was at all unusual. 
Dagvard walked over to a vending machine on the side of the platform. He took 
off his metal helmet. Then he rapped, with one mailed glove, on the side of the 
machine. "Orders from the earl," he said. "Choc'lits." A ratcheting whirr came from 
deep in the guts of the machine, and it began to spit out dozens of Cadbury's Fruit and 
Nut chocolate bars, one after another. Dagvard held his helmet below the opening to 
catch them. The doors began to close. Halvard put the handle of his pike between the 
doors, and they opened again and began bumping open and shut on the pike handle. 
"Please stand clear of the doors," said a loudspeaker voice. "The train cannot leave 
until the doors are all closed." 
The earl was staring at Door lopsidedly, with his one good eye. "So. What brings 
you here to me?" he asked. 

She licked her lips. "Well, indirectly, Your Grace, my father's death." 
He nodded, slowly. "Yes. You seek vengeance. Quite right, too." He coughed, 
then recited, in a basso profundo, "Brave the battling blade, flashes the furious fire, 
steel sword sheathed in hated heart, crimsons the . . . the . . . something. Yes." 
"Vengeance?" Door thought for a moment. "Yes. That was what my father said. 
But I mostly just want to understand what happened, and to protect myself. My family 
had no enemies." Dagvard staggered back onto the train then, his helmet filled with 
chocolate bars and cans of Coke; the doors were permitted to close, and the train moved 
off once more. 
  
Lear's coat, still on the floor of the tunnel, was covered in coins and bills, now, but 
it was also covered with shoes—kicking the coins, smearing and tearing the bills, 
ripping the fabric of the coat. Lear had begun to cry. "Please. Why won't you leave me 
alone?" he begged. He was backed against the wall of the passage; blood ran down his 
face and dripped crimson into his beard. His saxophone hung limply, awkwardly, on his 
chest, dented and scraped. 
He was surrounded by a small crowd of people—more than twenty, less than 
fifty—every one of them shoving and pushing, in a mindless mob, their eyes blank and 
staring, each man and woman desperately fighting and clawing in order to give Lear 
their money. There was blood on the tiled wall, where Lear had knocked his head. Lear 
flailed out at one middle-aged woman, her purse wide open, a fistful of five-pound 
notes thrust out at him. She clawed at his face in her eagerness to give him her money. 
He twisted to avoid her fingernails and fell to the tunnel floor. 
Someone stepped on his hand. His face was pushed into a slurry of coins. He 
began to sob, and to curse. "I told you not to overuse that tune," said an elegant voice, 
nearby. "Naughty." 
"Help me," gasped Lear. 
"Well, there is a counter-charm," admitted the voice, almost reluctantly. 
The crowd was pressing closer now. A flung fifty-pence coin opened Lear's cheek. 
He curled into a fetal ball, hugging himself, burying his face in his knees. "Play it, 
damn you," sobbed Lear. "Whatever you want . . . just make them stop . . . " 
A pennywhistle piping began softly, and echoed down the passage. A simple 
phrase, repeated over and over, slightly different every time: the de Carabas variations. 
The footsteps were moving away. Shuffling, at first, then picking up pace: moving 
away from him. Lear opened his eyes. The marquis de Carabas was leaning against the 
wall, playing the pennywhistle. When he saw Lear looking at him he took the whistle 
from his lips and replaced it in an inside pocket of his coat. He tossed Lear a lace-edged 
handkerchief of patched linen. Lear wiped the blood from his forehead and face. "They 
would have killed me," he said, accusingly. 
"I did warn you," said de Carabas. "Just count yourself lucky that I was coming 
back this way." He helped Lear into a sitting position. "Now," he said. "I think you owe 
me another favor." 
Lear picked up his coat—torn and muddy and imprinted with the marks of many 
feet—from the passage floor. He suddenly felt very cold, and he wrapped the shredded 

coat around his shoulders. Coins fell, and bills fluttered to the floor. He let them lie. 
"Was I really lucky? Or did you set me up?" 
The marquis looked almost offended. "I don't know how you could even bring 
yourself to think such a thing." 
'"Cos I know you. That's how. So what is it that you want me to do this time? 
Theft? Arson?" Lear sounded resigned, and a little sad. And then, "Murder?" 
De Carabas reached down and took back his handkerchief. "Theft, I'm afraid. You 
were right the first time," he said, with a smile. "I find myself in rather urgent need of a 
piece of T'ang dynasty sculpture." Lear shivered. Then, slowly, he nodded. 
  
Richard was handed a bar of Cadbury's Fruit and Nut chocolate and a large silver 
goblet, ornamented around the rim with what appeared to Richard to be sapphires. The 
goblet was filled with Coca-Cola. The jester, whose name seemed to be Tooley, cleared 
his throat loudly. "I would like to propose a toast to our guests," he said. "A child, a 
bravo, a fool. May they each get what they deserve." 
"Which one am I?" whispered Richard to Hunter. 
"The fool, of course," she said. 
"In the old days," said Halvard dismally, after sipping his Coke, "we had wine. I 
prefer wine. It's not as sticky." 
"Do all the machines just give you things like that?" asked Richard. 
"Oh yes," said the old man. "They listen to the earl, y'see. He rules the 
Underground. The bit with the trains. He's lord of the Central, the Circle, the Jubilee, 
the Victorious, the Bakerloo—well, all of them except the Underside Line." 
"What's the Underside Line?" asked Richard. Halvard shook his head and pursed 
his lips. Hunter brushed Richard's shoulder with her fingers. "Remember what I told 
you about the shepherds of Shepherd's Bush?" 
"You said I didn't want to meet them, and there were some things I was probably 
better off not knowing." 
"Good," she said, "So now you can add the Underside Line to the list of those 
things." 
Door came back down the carriage toward them. She was smiling. "The earl's 
agreed to help us," she said. "Come on. He's meeting us in the library." Richard began 
to follow, as he realized that the question What library? had not risen to his lips. The 
longer he was here, the more he took at face value. Instead, he followed Door toward 
the earl's empty throne, and round the back of it, and through the connecting door 
behind it, and into the library. It was a huge stone room, with a high wooden ceiling. 
Each wall was covered with shelves. Each shelf was laden with objects: there were 
books, yes. But the shelves were filled with a host of other things: tennis rackets, 
hockey sticks, umbrellas, a spade, a notebook computer, a wooden leg, several mugs, 
dozens of shoes, pairs of binoculars, a small log, six glove puppets, a lava lamp, various 
CDs, records (LPs, 45s, and 78s), cassette tapes and eight-tracks, dice, toy cars, 
assorted pairs of dentures, watches, flashlights, four garden gnomes of assorted sizes 
(two fishing, one of them mooning, the last smoking a cigar), piles of newspapers, 

magazines, grimoires, three-legged stools, a box of cigars, a plastic nodding-head 
Alsatian, socks . . . the room was a tiny empire of lost property. 
"This is his real domain," muttered Hunter. "Things lost. Things forgotten." 
There were windows set in the stone wall. Through them, Richard could see the 
rattling darkness and the passing lights of the Underground tunnels. The earl was sitting 
on the floor with his legs splayed, patting the wolfhound and scratching it underneath 
the chin. The jester stood beside him, looking embarrassed. The earl clambered to his 
feet when he saw them. His forehead creased. "Ah. There you are. Now, there was a 
reason I asked you here, it'll come to me . . . " He tugged at his red-gray beard, a tiny 
gesture from such a huge man. 
"The Angel Islington, Your Grace," said Door politely. 
"Oh yes. Your father had a lot of ideas for changes, you know. Asked me about 
them. I don't trust change. I sent him to Islington." He stopped. Blinked his one eye. 
"Did I tell you this already?" 
"Yes, Your Grace. And how can we get to Islington?" 
The earl nodded as if Door had said something profound. "Only once by the quick 
way. After that you have to go the long way down. Dangerous." 
Door said, patiently, "And the quick way is . . . ?" 
"No, no. Need to be an opener to use it. Only good for Portico's family." He rested 
a huge hand on her shoulder. Then his hand slid up to her cheek. "Better off staying 
here with me. Keep an old man warm at night, eh?" He leered at her and touched her 
tangle of hair with his old fingers. Hunter took a step toward Door. Door gestured with 
her hand: No. Not yet. 
Door looked up at the earl, and said, "Your Grace, I am Portico's oldest daughter. 
How do I get to the Angel Islington?" Richard found himself amazed that Door was 
able to keep her temper in the face of the earl's losing battle with temporal drift. 
The earl winked his single eye in a solemn blink: an old hawk, his head tipped on 
one side. Then he took his hand from her hair. "So you are. So you are. Portico's 
daughter. How is your dear father? Keeping well, I hope? Fine man. Good man." 
"How do we get to the Angel Islington?" said Door, but now there was a tremble 
in her voice. 
"Hmm? Use the Angelus, of course." 
Richard found himself imagining the earl sixty, eighty, five hundred years ago: a 
mighty warrior, a cunning strategist, a great lover of women, a fine friend, a terrifying 
foe. There was still the wreckage of that man in there somewhere. That was what made 
him so terrible, and so sad. The earl fumbled on the shelves, moving pens and pipes and 
peashooters, little gargoyles and dead leaves. Then, like an aged cat stumbling on a 
mouse, he seized a small, rolled-up scroll, and handed it to the girl. "Here y'go, lassie," 
said the earl. "All in here. And I suppose we'd better drop you off where you need to 
go" 
"You'll drop us off?" asked Richard. "In a train?" 

The earl looked around for the source of the sound, focused on Richard, and 
smiled enormously. "Oh, think nothing of it," he boomed. "Anything for Portico's 
daughter." Door clutched the scroll tightly, triumphantly. 
Richard could feel the train beginning to slow, and he, and Door, and Hunter were 
led out of the stone room and back into the car. Richard peered out at the platform, as 
they slowed down. 
"Excuse me. What station is this?" he asked. The train had stopped, facing one of 
the station signs: BRITISH MUSEUM, it said. Somehow, this was one oddity too many. 
He could accept "Mind the Gap" and the Earl's Court, and even the strange library. But 
damn it, like all Londoners, he knew his Tube map, and this was going too far. "There 
isn't a British Museum Station," said Richard, firmly. 
"There isn't?" boomed the earl. "Then, mm, then you must be very careful as you 
get off the train." And he guffawed, delightedly, and tapped his jester on the shoulder. 
"Hear that, Tooley? I am as funny as you are." 
The jester smiled as bleak a smile as ever was seen. "My sides are splitting, my 
ribs are cracking, and my mirth is positively uncontainable, Your Grace," he said. 
The doors hissed open. Door smiled up at the earl. "Thank you," she said. "Off, 
off," said the vast old man, shooing Door and Richard and Hunter out of the warm, 
smoky carriage onto the empty platform. And then the doors closed, and the train 
moved away, and Richard found himself staring at a sign which, no matter how many 
times he blinked—nor even if he looked away from it and looked back suddenly to take 
it by surprise—still obstinately persisted in saying: 
BRITISH MUSEUM 

EIGHT 
It was early evening, and the cloudless sky was transmuting from royal blue to a deep 
violet, with a smudge of fire orange and lime green over Paddington, four miles to the 
west, where, from Old Bailey's perspective anyway, the sun had recently set. 
Skies, thought Old Bailey, in a satisfied sort of a way. Never a two of them alike. 
Not by day nor not by night, neither. He was a bit of a connoisseur of skies, was Old 
Bailey, and this was a good 'un. The old man had pitched his tent for the night on a roof 
opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, in the center of the City of London. 
He was fond of St. Paul's, and it, at least, had changed little in the last three 
hundred years. It had been built in white Portland stone, which had, before it was even 
completed, begun to turn black from the soot and the filth in the smoky London air and 
now, following the cleaning of London in the 1970s, was more or less white again; but 
it was still St. Paul's. He was not sure that the same could be said for the rest of the City 
of London: he peered over the roof, stared away from his beloved Sky, down to the 
sodium-lit pavement below. He could see security cameras affixed to a wall, and a few 
cars, and one late office worker, locking a door and then walking toward the Tube. 
Brrr. Even the thought of going underground made Old Bailey shudder. He was a roof-
man and proud of it; had fled the world at ground level so long ago . . .  
Old Bailey remembered when people had actually lived here in the City, not just 
worked; when they had lived and lusted and laughed, built ramshackle houses one 
leaning against the next, each house filled with noisy people. Why, the noise and the 
mess and the stinks and the songs from the alley across the way (then known, at least 
colloquially, as Shitten Alley) had been legendary in their time, but no one lived in the 
City now. It was a cold and cheerless place of offices, of people who worked in the day 
and went home to somewhere else at night. It was not a place for living anymore. He 
even missed the stinks. 
The last smudge of orange sun faded into nocturnal purple. The old man covered 
the cages, so the birds could get their beauty sleep. They grumbled, then slept. Old 
Bailey scratched his nose, after which he went into his tent and fetched a blackened 
stew-pot, some water, some carrots and potatoes, salt, and a well-hanged pair of dead, 
plucked starlings. He walked out onto the roof, lit a small fire in a soot-blackened 
coffee can, and was putting his stew on to cook when he became aware that someone 
was watching him from the shadows by a chimney stack. 
He picked up his toasting fork and waved it threateningly at the chimney stack. 
"Who's there?" 
The marquis de Carabas stepped out of the shadows, bowed perfunctorily, and 
smiled gloriously. Old Bailey lowered his toasting fork. "Oh," he said. "It's you. Well, 
what do you want? Knowledge? Or birds?" 
The marquis walked over, picked a slice of raw carrot from Old Bailey's stew, and 
munched it. "Information, actually," he said. 
Old Bailey chortled. "Hah," he said. "There's a first. Ehh?" Then he leaned toward 
the marquis. "What'll you trade for it?" 
"What do you need?" 

"Maybe I should do what you do. I should ask for another favor. An investment 
for one day down the road." Old Bailey grinned. 
"Much too expensive, in the long run," said the marquis, without humor. 
Old Bailey nodded. Now the sun had gone down, it was getting very cold, very 
fast. "Shoes, then," he said. "And a balaclava hat." He inspected his fingerless gloves: 
they were more hole than glove. "And new gloveses. It's going to be a bastard winter." 
"Very well. I'll bring them to you." The marquis de Carabas put his hand into an 
inside pocket and produced, like a magician producing a rose from thin air, the black 
animal figure he had taken from Portico's study. "Now. What can you tell me about 
this?" 
Old Bailey pulled on his glasses. He took the object from de Carabas. It was cold 
to the touch. He sat down on an air-conditioning unit, then, turning the black obsidian 
statue over and over in his hand, he announced: "It's the Great Beast of London." The 
marquis said nothing. His eyes flickered from the statue to Old Bailey, impatiently. Old 
Bailey, enjoying the marquis's minor discomfort, continued at his own pace. "Now, 
they say that back in first King Charlie's day—him 'as got his head all chopped off, silly 
bugger—before the fire and the plague, this was, there was a butcher lived down by the 
Fleet Ditch, had some poor creature he was going to fatten up for Christmas. Some says 
it was a piglet, and some says it wusn't, and there's some—and I list meself as one of 
them—that wusn't never properly certain. One night in December the beast runned 
away, ran into the Fleet Ditch, and vanished into the sewers. And it fed on the sewage, 
and it grew, and it grew. And it got meaner, and nastier. They'd send in hunting parties 
after it, from time to time." 
The marquis pursed his lips. "It must have died three hundred years ago." 
Old Bailey shook his head. "Things like that, they're too vicious to die. Too old 
and big and nasty." 
The marquis sighed. "I thought it was just a legend," he said. "Like the alligators 
in the sewers of New York City." 
Old Bailey nodded, sagely. "What, the big white buggers? They're down there. I 
had a friend lost a head to one of them." A moment of silence. Old Bailey handed the 
statue back to the marquis. Then he raised his hand and snapped it, like a crocodile 
head, at de Carabas. "It was okay," gurned Old Bailey with a grin that was most terrible 
to behold. "He had another." 
The marquis sniffed, uncertain whether or not Old Bailey was pulling his leg. He 
made the statue of the Beast vanish inside his coat once more. 
"Hang on," said Old Bailey. He went back inside his brown tent and returned 
holding the ornate silver box the marquis had given him on their previous meeting. He 
held it out to the marquis. "How about this then?" he asked. "Are you ready to take it 
back? It fair gives me the creepy shivers, having it around." 
The marquis walked to the edge of the roof, dropped the eight feet to the next 
building. "I'll take it back, when all this is over," he called. "Let us hope that you don't 
have to use it." 
Old Bailey leaned over. "How will I know if I do?" 

"You'll know," called the marquis. "And the rats will tell you what to do with it." 
And with that he was over the side of the building, slipping down, using drainpipes and 
ledges as handholds. 
"Hope I never finds out, that's all I can say," said Old Bailey to himself. Then a 
thought struck him. "Hoy," he called out to the night and the City. "Don't forget the 
shoeses and the gloveses!" 
  
The advertisements on the walls were for refreshing and health-giving malted 
drinks, for two-shilling day excursions by train to the seaside, for kippered herrings, 
moustache wax and bootblack. They were smoke-blackened relics of the late twenties 
or the early thirties. Richard stared at them in disbelief. It seemed completely 
abandoned: a forgotten place. "It is British Museum Station," admitted Richard. "But 
. . . but there never was a British Museum Station. This is all wrong." 
"It was closed down in about 1933, and sealed off," said Door. 
"How bizarre," said Richard. It was like walking through history. He could hear 
trains echoing through tunnels nearby, felt the push of air as they passed. "Are there 
many stations like this?" 
"About fifty," said Hunter. "They aren't all accessible, though. Not even to us." 
There was a movement in the shadows at the edge of the platform. "Hello," said 
Door. "How are you?" She went down into a crouch. A brown rat stepped out into the 
light. It sniffed at Door's hand. 
"Thank you!" said Door, cheerfully. "I'm glad you aren't dead, too." 
Richard edged over. "Um, Door. Could you tell the rat something for me?" 
The rat turned its head toward him. "Miss Whiskers says that if there's anything 
you've got to say to her, you can tell it to her yourself," said Door. 
"Miss Whiskers?" 
Door shrugged. "It's a literal translation," she said. "It sounds better in rat." 
Richard did not doubt it. "Um. Hello . . . Miss Whiskers . . . Look, there was one 
of your rat-speaker people, a girl named Anaesthesia. She was taking me to the market. 
We were crossing this bridge in the dark, and she just never made it across." 
The rat interrupted him, with a sharp squee. Door began to talk, hesitantly, like a 
simultaneous translator. "She says . . . that the rats do not blame you for the loss. Your 
guide was . . . mm . . . taken by the night . . . as tribute." 
"But—" 
The rat squeaked again. "Sometimes they come back . . . " said Door. "She has 
taken note of your concern . . . and thanks you for it." The rat nodded to Richard, 
blinked her bead-black eyes, then leapt to the floor and scurried back into the dark. 
"Nice rat," said Door. Her disposition seemed to have improved remarkably, now that 
she had the scroll. "Up there," she said, indicating an archway effectively blocked by an 
iron door. 
They walked over to it. Richard pushed against the metal, but it was locked from 
the other side. "Looks like it's been sealed up," said Richard. "We'll need special tools." 

Door smiled, suddenly; her face seemed to be illuminated. For a moment, her elfin 
face became beautiful. "Richard," she said. "My family. We're openers. It's, our Talent. 
Look . . . " She reached out a grubby hand, touched the door. For a long moment 
nothing happened, then there was a loud crash from the other side of the door, and a 
chunk from their side. Door pushed against the door and, with a fierce squeal from the 
rusted hinges, it opened. Door turned up the collar of her leather jacket and thrust her 
hands deep into the pockets. Hunter shone her flashlight into the blackness beyond the 
doorway: a flight of stone steps, going up, into the dark. "Hunter. Can you take the 
rear?" asked Door. "I'll go on in front. Richard can take the middle." 
She walked up a couple of steps. Hunter stayed where she was. "Lady?" said 
Hunter. "You are going to London Above?" 
"That's right," said Door. "We're going to the British Museum." 
Hunter bit her lower lip. Then she shook her head. "I must stay in London Below," 
she said. There was a tremble in her voice. Richard realized that this was the first time 
he had ever seen Hunter display any emotion other than effortless competence or, 
occasionally, tolerant amusement. 
"Hunter," said Door, bewildered. "You're my bodyguard." 
Hunter looked ill at ease. "I am your bodyguard in London Below," she said. "I 
cannot go with you to London Above." 
"But you have to." 
"My lady. I cannot. I thought you understood. The marquis knows." Hunter will 
look after you as long as you stay in London Below, thought Richard. Yes. 
"No," said Door, her pointed chin pushed out and up, her odd-colored eyes 
narrowed. "I don't understand. What is it?" she added, scornfully. "Some kind of curse 
or something?" Hunter hesitated, licked her lips, then nodded. It was as if she were 
admitting to having some socially embarrassing disease. 
"Look, Hunter," Richard heard his own voice saying, "don't be silly." For a 
moment he thought she was about to hit him, which would have been bad, or even to 
start crying, which would have been much, much worse. Then she took a deep breath, 
and said, in measured tones, "I will walk by your side when you are in London Below, 
my lady, and I shall guard your body from all harm that might befall you. But do not 
ask me to follow you to London Above. I cannot." She folded her arms beneath her 
breasts, planted her legs a little apart, and looked for all the underworld like a statue of 
a woman not going anywhere, cast in brass and in bronze and in burnt caramel. 
"Right," said Door. "Come on, Richard." And she set off up the steps. 
"Look," said Richard. "Why don't we stay down here? We can find the marquis, 
and then all set off together, and—" Door was disappearing into the darkness above 
him. Hunter was planted at the foot of the stairs. 
"I shall wait here until she returns," Hunter told him. "You may go, or stay, as you 
will." 
Richard chased up the steps, as fast as he could, in the dark. Soon he saw Door's 
lamp-light above him. "Wait," he panted. "Please." She stopped, and waited for him to 
catch up. And then, when he had caught up, and was standing next to her on a 
claustrophobically small landing, she waited for him to catch his breath. "You can't just 

go running off like that," said Richard. Door said nothing; the line of her lips became 
slightly more compressed; the angle of her chin was ever-so-slightly raised. "She's your 
bodyguard," he pointed out. 
Door began to walk up the next flight of steps. Richard followed her. "Well, we'll 
be back soon enough," said Door. "She can start guarding me again then." 
The air was close, dank and oppressive. Richard wondered how you could tell if 
the air was bad, in the absence of a canary, and he contented himself with hoping that it 
wasn't. "I think the marquis probably did know. About her curse, or whatever it is," he 
said. 
"Yes," she said. "I expect he did." 
"He . . . " Richard began. "The marquis. Well, you know, to be honest, he seems a 
little bit dodgy to me." 
Door stopped. The steps dead-ended in a rough brick wall. "Mm," she agreed. 
"He's a little bit dodgy in the same way that rats are a little bit covered in fur." 
"Then why go to him for help? Wasn't there someone else who could have helped 
you?" 
"We'll talk about it later." She opened the scroll the earl had given her, glanced 
over the spidery handwriting, then rolled it back up. "We'll be fine," she said, 
decisively. "It's all in here. We've just got to get into the British Museum. We find the 
Angelus, we get out. Easy. Nothing to it. Close your eyes." 
Richard closed his eyes, obediently. "Nothing to it," he repeated. "When people 
say that on films, it always means that something awful is going to happen." 
He felt a breeze against his face. Something in the quality of the darkness beyond 
his closed eyelids changed. "So what's your point?" asked Door. The acoustics had 
altered as well: they were in a bigger room. "You can open your eyes now." 
He opened his eyes. They were on the other side of the wall, he assumed, in what 
appeared to be a junk room. Not just any old junk room, though: there was something 
rather strange and special about the quality of this junk. It was the kind of magnificent, 
rare, strange, and expensive junk one would only expect to see somewhere like . . . 
"Are we in the British Museum?" he asked. She frowned, and seemed to be thinking, or 
listening. "Not exactly. We're very near. I think this must be some kind of storage space 
or something." She reached up to touch the fabric of a suit of antique clothing, 
displayed on a wax dummy. 
"I wish we'd stayed back with the bodyguard" said Richard. 
Door tipped her head on one side and looked at him gravely. "And what do you 
need guarding from, Richard Mayhew?" 
"Nothing," he admitted. And then they turned the corner, and he said, "Well . . . 
maybe them," and, at the same time, Door said, "Shit." Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar 
were standing on plinths on each side of the aisle down which they walked. 
They reminded Richard horridly of an exhibition of contemporary art Jessica had 
once taken him to: an exciting young artist had announced that he would break down all 
the Taboos of Art, and to this end, had embarked on a campaign of systematic grave 
robbery, displaying the thirty most interesting results of his depredations in glass cases. 
The exhibit was closed after the artist sold Stolen Cadaver Number 25 to an advertising 

agency for a six-figure sum, and the relatives of Stolen Cadaver Number 25, seeing a 
photo of the sculpture in the Sun, had sued both for a share of the proceeds and to 
change the name of the art piece to Edgar Fospring, 1919-1987 Loving Husband, 
Father and Uncle. Rest in Peace, Daddy. Richard had stared at the glass-bound corpses 
in their stained suits and damaged dresses with horror: he hated himself for looking, but 
he had not been able to turn away. 
Mr. Croup smiled like a snake with a crescent moon stuck in its mouth, and his 
resemblance to Stolen Cadavers Numbers 1 to 30 was, if anything, increased by this. 
"What?" said the smiling Mr. Croup. "No Mister 'I'm So Clever and Know Everything' 
Marquis? No 'Oh, didn't I tell you? Whoops! I can't go upstairs?' Hunter?" He paused, 
for dramatic effect. "So paint me gray and call me a dire wolf if it isn't two little lost 
lambs, out on their own, after dark." 
"You could call me a wolf, too, Mister Croup," said Mr. Vandemar, helpfully. 
Mr. Croup clambered down from his plinth. "A gentle word in your woolly ears, 
little lambkins," he said. Richard looked around them. There had to be somewhere they 
could run. He reached down, clasped Door's hand, and looked around, desperately. 
"No, please. Stay just where you are," said Mr. Croup. "We like you like that. And 
we don't want to have to hurt you." 
"We do," said Mr. Vandemar. 
"Well, yes, Mister Vandemar, once you put it like that. We want to hurt you both. 
We want to hurt you a lot. But that's not why we're here right now. We're here to make 
things more interesting. You see, when things get dull, my partner and I become restive 
and, hard as you may find this to believe, we lose our sunny and delightful 
dispositions." 
Mr. Vandemar showed them his teeth, demonstrating his sunny and delightful 
disposition. It was unquestionably the most horrible thing that Richard had ever seen. 
"Leave us alone," said Door. Her voice was clear and steady. Richard squeezed her 
hand. If she could be brave, so could he. "If you want to hurt her," he said, "you'll have 
to kill me first." 
Mr. Vandemar seemed genuinely pleased by this. "All right," he said. "Thanks." 
"And we'll hurt you, too," said Mr. Croup. 
"Not yet, though," said Mr. Vandemar. 
"You see," explained Mr. Croup, in a voice like rancid butter, "right now, we're 
just here to worry you." 
Mr. Vandemar's voice was a night wind blowing over a desert of bones. "Make 
you suffer," he said. "Spoil your day." 
Mr. Croup sat down at the base of Mr. Vandemar's plinth. "You visited Earl's 
Court today," he said, in what Richard suspected he fondly imagined were light and 
conversational tones. 
"So?" said Door. She was edging away from them, now. 
Mr. Croup smiled. "How did we know that? How did we know where to find you 
now?" 
"Can get to you any time at all," said Mr. Vandemar, almost in a whisper. 

"You've been sold out, little ladybird," said Mr. Croup to Door—and, Richard 
realized, to Door alone. "There's a traitor in your nest. A cuckoo." 
"Come on," she said, and she ran. Richard ran with her, through the hall filled with 
junk, toward a door. At Door's touch, it opened. 
"Bid them farewell, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup's voice, from behind them. 
"Bye bye," said Mr. Vandemar. 
"No-no," corrected Mr. Croup. "Au revoir." He made a noise then—the cuck-koo 
cuck-koo that a cuckoo might make, if it were five and a half feet high and had a 
weakness for human flesh—while Mr. Vandemar, truer to his nature, threw back his 
bullet head and howled like a wolf, ghostly and feral and mad. 
  
They were outside, in the open air, at night, running down a pavement in 
Bloomsbury's Russell Street. Richard thought his heart would pound its way through 
his chest. A large black car went by. The British Museum was on the other side of some 
high, black-painted railings. Discreet concealed lights illuminated the outside of the 
high white Victorian building, the huge pillars of the facade, the steps up to the front 
door. This was the repository of so many of the world's treasures, looted and found and 
rescued and donated over hundreds of years. 
They reached a gate in the railings. Door grabbed it with both hands and pushed 
against it. Nothing happened. "Can't you make it open?" asked Richard. 
"What does it look like I'm trying to do?" she snapped back, an unfamiliar edge to 
her voice. A few hundred feet down the pavement, at the main gate, large cars were 
drawing up, couples in smart clothes were climbing out, walking along the drive toward 
the museum. 
"Down there," said Richard. "The main gate." 
Door nodded. She looked behind them. "Those two don't seem to be following us," 
she said. They hurried toward the main gate. 
"Are you all right?" asked Richard. "What happened just then?" 
Door hunched deep into her leather jacket. She was looking paler than usual, 
which was extremely pale indeed, and there were dark semicircles beneath her eyes. 
"I'm tired," she said, flatly. "Opened too many doors today. Takes a lot out of me, each 
time. I need a little time to recover. Something to eat, and I'll be fine." 
There was a guard on the gate, minutely examining the engraved invitations that 
each of the well-shaven men in dinner jackets and the fragrant women in evening 
dresses needed to present, then ticking their names off on a list, before allowing them 
through. A uniformed policeman beside him surveyed the guests implacably. Richard 
and Door walked through the gate, and no one glanced at them twice. There was a line 
of people standing on the stone steps that led up to the museum doors, and Richard and 
Door joined the line. A white-haired man, accompanied by a woman bravely wearing a 
mink coat, joined the line immediately and neatly behind them. A thought struck 
Richard. "Can they see us?" he asked. 
Door turned to the gentleman behind them in the line. She stared up at him. 
"Hello," she said. 

The man looked around, a puzzled expression on his face, as if he was unsure what 
had attracted his attention. Then he caught sight of Door, standing just in front of him. 
"Hello . . . ?" he said. 
"I'm Door," she told him. "This is Richard." 
"Oh . . . " said the man. Then he fumbled in an inner pocket, pulled out a cigar 
case, and forgot all about them. "There. See?" said Door. 
"I think so," he replied. They said nothing for some time, as the line moved slowly 
toward the single open glass door at the museum's main entrance. Door looked at the 
writing on her scroll, as if she needed to reassure herself of something. Then Richard 
said, "A traitor?" 
"They were just winding us up," said Door. "Trying to upset us." 
"Doing a bloody good job of it, too," said Richard. And they walked through the 
open door, and then they were in the British Museum. 
  
Mr. Vandemar was hungry, so they walked back through Trafalgar Square. 
"Scare her," muttered Mr. Croup, disgustedly. "Scare her. That we should be 
brought to this." 
Mr. Vandemar had found half a shrimp and lettuce sandwich in a garbage can, and 
was gently tearing it into small pieces, which he was tossing down onto the flagstones 
in front of him, attracting a small flock of hungry late-night pigeons. "Should have 
followed my idea," said Mr. Vandemar. "Would have scared her lots more if I'd pulled 
his head off while she wasn't looking, then put my hand up through his throat and 
wiggled my fingers about. They always scream," he confided, "when the eyeballs fall 
out." He demonstrated with his right hand. 
Mr. Croup was having none of it. "Why get so squeamish at this stage in the 
game?" he asked. 
"I'm not squeamish, Mister Croup," said Mr. Vandemar. "I like it when the 
eyeballs fall out. Peepers and tarriwags." More gray pigeons strutted over to peck at the 
fragments of bread and shrimp, and to disregard the lettuce. 
"Not you," said Mr. Croup. "The boss. Kill her, kidnap her, scare her. Why doesn't 
he make up his mind?" 
Mr. Vandemar ran out of the sandwich he had been using as bait, and now he 
made a dash into the crowd of pigeons, who took to the wing with some clacking noises 
and the occasional grumbling coo. "Well caught, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup, 
approvingly. Mr. Vandemar was holding a surprised and upset pigeon, which grumbled 
and fidgeted in his grasp and pecked ineffectively at his fingers. 
Mr. Croup sighed, dramatically. "Well, anyway. We've certainly put the cat 
amongst the pigeons now," he said, with relish. Mr. Vandemar held the pigeon up to his 
face. There was a crunching noise, as he bit off its head and commenced to chew. 
  
The security guards were directing the museum's guests to a hallway that seemed 
to be functioning as some kind of holding area. Door ignored the guards entirely and set 
off into the museum halls with Richard trailing along behind her. They went through 

the Egyptian rooms, up several flights of back stairs, and into a room marked Early 
English. 
"According to this scroll," she said, "the Angelus is in this room somewhere." 
Then Door looked down at her scroll some more and looked around the hall, more 
carefully. She made a face. "Tch," she explained, and took off back down the stairs, the 
way they had come. Richard had an intense feeling of déjà vu, before realizing that, 
yes, of course this felt familiar: it was how he had spent his weekends in the Jessica 
days. Which were starting to seem, already, like things that had happened to someone 
else a long, long time ago. 
"The Angelus wasn't in that room, then?" asked Richard. 
"No, it wasn't there," said Door, a little more fiercely than Richard felt the question 
had actually warranted. 
"Oh," he said. "I only wondered." They went into another room. Richard wondered 
if he were starting to hallucinate. "I can hear music," he said. It sounded like a string 
quartet. 
"The party," said Door. 
Right. The people in the dinner jackets they had lined up with. No, the Angelus 
didn't seem to be here either. Door walked into the next hall, and Richard trailed in her 
wake. He wished he could be of more use. "This Angelus," he said. "What does it look 
like?" 
For a moment he thought she was going to reprimand him simply for asking. But 
she stopped, rubbed her forehead. "This just says it's got a picture of an angel on it. But 
it can't be that hard to find. After all," she added, hopefully, "how many things with 
angels on them are there here?" 

NINE 
Jessica was under a little pressure. She was worried, and nervous, and jittery. She had 
catalogued the collection, arranged with the British Museum to host the exhibition, 
organized the restoration of the prime exhibit, assisted in hanging and exhibiting the 
collection, and put together the list of invitees to the fabulous launch. It was just as well 
she didn't have a boyfriend, she would tell her friends. There'd be no time for one even 
if she had one. Still, it would be nice, she thought, when she got a moment: someone to 
go to galleries with on the weekends. Someone to . . .  
No. She did not go to that place in her head. She could no more pin it down than 
she could put her finger on a bead of mercury, and she refocused on the exhibition. 
Even now, at the last minute, there were so many things that could go wrong. Many a 
horse had fallen at the final hurdle. Many an overconfident general had seen certain 
victory turn to defeat in the closing minutes of a battle. Jessica was simply going to 
ensure that nothing went wrong. She was wearing a green silk dress, an off-the-
shoulder general marshalling her troops and stoically pretending that Mr. Stockton was 
not half an hour late. 
Her troops consisted of a head waiter, a dozen serving staff, three women from the 
caterers, a string quartet, and her assistant, a young man named Clarence. 
She inspected the drinks table. "We're fine for champagne? Yes?" The head waiter 
pointed to the crate of champagne beneath the table. "And sparkling mineral water?" 
Another nod. Another crate. Jessica pursed her lips. "What about plain mineral water? 
Bubbles aren't everybody's cup of tea, you know." They had plenty of plain mineral 
water. Good. 
The string quartet was warming up. They were not quite loud enough to drown the 
noise coming from the hallway outside. It was the noise of a small but affluent crowd: 
the grumbling of ladies in mink coats, and men, who, were it not for the NO SMOKING 
signs on the walls—and perhaps the advice of their doctors—would be smoking cigars; 
the grumbling of journalists and celebrities who could smell the canapes, vol-au-vents, 
sundry nibbles, and free champagne. 
Clarence was talking to someone on his portable phone, a slimline piece of fold-
out engineering that made the Star Trek communicators look bulky and old-fashioned. 
He turned it off, pushed down the antenna, put it into the Armani pocket of his Armani 
suit, where it did not even make a bulge. He smiled, reassuringly. "Jessica, Mister 
Stockton's driver's phoned from the car. They're still running a couple of minutes late. 
Nothing to worry about." 
"Nothing to worry about," echoed Jessica. Doomed. Doomed. The whole thing 
was going to be a disaster. Her disaster. She picked up a glass of champagne from the 
table, emptied it, and handed the empty glass to the wine waiter. 
Clarence tipped his head on one side, listening to the grumbling reverberation 
from the hallway outside. The crowd wanted in. He looked at his watch, then looked at 
Jessica questioningly, a captain querying his general. Into the Valley of Death, then, 
boss? "Mister Stockton is on his way, Clarence," Jessica said, calmly. "He has 
requested a private viewing before the event begins." 

"Shall I go out and see how they're doing?" 
"No," she said, decisively. Then, just as decisively, "Yes." Food and drink dealt 
with, Jessica turned to the string quartet and asked them, for the third time that evening, 
exactly what they planned to play. 
Clarence opened the double doors to check on the crowd. It was worse than he had 
thought: there had to be more than a hundred people in the hall. And they weren't just 
people. They were People. Some of them were even Personalities. 
"Excuse me," said the chairman of the Arts Council. "The invitations said eight 
o'clock sharp. It's twenty past eight already." 
"We'll just be a few more minutes," reassured Clarence, smoothly. "Security 
arrangements." 
A woman in a hat bore down on him. Her voice was stentorian, bullying, and 
decidedly parliamentary. "Young man," she announced. "Do you know who I am?" 
"Not really, no," lied Clarence, who knew exactly who all of them were. "Hold 
on—I'll see if anyone in here does." He shut the door behind him. "Jessica? They're 
going to riot." 
"Don't exaggerate, Clarence." She was moving around the room like a green silk 
whirlwind, positioning her serving staff, with their trays of canapes or drinks, in 
strategic corners of the hall; checking the public-address system, the podium, the 
curtain, and the pull-rope. "I can see the headlines now," said Clarence, unfolding an 
imaginary newspaper. " 'Geritol Billionaires Crush Marketing Babe in Museum 
Canape Dash Horror.' " 
Somebody began knocking at the door. The volume in the hallway began to 
increase. Somebody was saying, very loudly, "Excuse me. Um. Excuse me." Someone 
else was informing the crowd that it was a disgrace, quite simply a disgrace, no other 
word for it. "Executive decision," said Clarence, suddenly. "I'm letting them in." 
Jessica shouted, "No! If you—" 
But it was too late. The doors were open, and the horde was pushing its way into 
the hall. The expression on Jessica's face morphed from one of horror to one of 
charmed delight. She shimmered toward the door. "Baroness," she said, with a happy 
smile. "I can't tell you how delighted we are that you were able to come to our little 
exhibition this evening. Mister Stockton's been unavoidably delayed, but he'll be here 
momentarily. Please, have some canapes . . . " Over the baroness's mink-draped 
shoulder, Clarence winked at her, cheerfully. Jessica ran through all the bad words she 
knew in her head. As soon as the baroness had headed for the vol-au-vents, Jessica 
walked over to Clarence and, in a whisper, and still smiling, called him several of them. 
  
Richard froze. A security guard was coming straight toward them, the beam of his 
flashlight flashing from side to side. Richard looked around for somewhere to hide. 
Too late. Another guard was walking their way, past the huge statues of dead 
Greek gods, flashlight beam swinging. "All right?" called the first guard. The other 
guard kept coming, and stopped just beside Richard and Door. 
"I suppose," she said. "I've already had to stop a couple of idiots in suits from 
carving their initials on the Rosetta stone. I hate these functions." 

The first guard shone his flashlight straight into Richard's eyes, then let the beam 
slide off, skittering over shadows. "I keep telling you," he said, with the satisfied relish 
of any true prophet, "it's The Masque of the Red Death all over again. A decadent elite 
party, while civilization crumbles about their ears." He picked his nose, wiped it on the 
leather sole of his well-polished black boot. 
The second guard sighed. "Thank you, Gerald. Right, back on patrol." 
The guards walked out of the hall together. "Last one of these events we found 
someone had puked in a sarcophagus," said one of the guards, and then the door closed 
behind them. 
"If you're part of London Below," said Door to Richard, in a conversational voice, 
as they walked, side by side, into the next hall, "they normally don't even notice you 
exist unless you stop and talk to them. And even then, they forget you pretty quickly." 
"But I saw you," said Richard. It had been bothering him for a while. 
"I know," said Door. "Isn't that odd?" 
"Everything's odd," said Richard, with feeling. The string music was getting 
louder. The surges of anxiety were somehow worse up here in London Above, where 
he was forced to reconcile these two universes. At least below, he could just proceed 
dreamlike, putting one foot in front of the other like a sleepwalker. 
"The Angelus is through there," announced Door, interrupting his reverie, pointing 
to the direction from which the music was coming. 
"How do you know?" 
"I know," she said, with utter certainty. "Come on." They stepped out of the 
darkness into a lighted corridor. There was a huge sign hanging across the corridor. It 
said: 
ANGELS OVER ENGLAND 
AN EXHIBITION AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM 
Sponsored by Stocktons PLC 
They crossed the corridor and walked through an open door, into a large room in 
which a party was going on. 
  
There was a string quartet playing, and a number of serving staff were providing a 
roomful of well-dressed people with food and drink. There was a small stage in one 
corner of the room, with a podium on it, beside a high curtain. 
The room was completely filled with angels. 
There were statues of angels on tiny plinths. There were paintings of angels on the 
walls. There were angel frescoes. There were huge angels and tiny angels, stiff angels 
and amiable angels, angels with wings and haloes and angels with neither, warlike 
angels and peaceable angels. There were modern angels and classical angels. Hundreds 
upon hundreds of angels of every size and shape. Western angels, Middle Eastern 
angels, Eastern angels. Michelangelo angels. Joel Peter Witkin angels, Picasso angels, 
War-hoi angels. Mr. Stockton's angel collection was "indiscriminate to the point of 
trashiness, but certainly impressive in its eclecticism" (Time Out). 

"Would you think," Richard asked, "that I was being picky if I pointed out that 
trying to find something with an angel on it in here is going to be like trying to find a 
needle in an oh my God it's Jessica." Richard felt the blood drain from his face. Until 
now he had thought that that was simply a figure of speech. He hadn't thought it 
actually happened in real life. 
"Someone you knew?" asked Door. Richard nodded. "She was my. Well. We were 
going to be married. We've been together for a couple of years. She was with me when 
I found you. She was the one on the. She left that message. On the answering machine." 
He pointed across the room: Jessica was making animated conversation with Sir 
Andrew Lloyd Webber, Bob Geldof, and a bespectacled gentleman who looked 
suspiciously like a Saatchi. Every few minutes she checked her watch and glanced 
toward the door. 
"Her?" said Door, recognizing the woman. Then, obviously feeling that she should 
say something nice about someone Richard had cared for, she said, "Well, she's very 
. . . " and she paused, and thought, and then said, " . . . clean." 
Richard stared across the room. "Will she . . . is she going to be upset that we're 
here?" 
"I doubt it," said Door. "Frankly, unless you do something stupid, like talk to her, 
she probably won't even notice you." And then, with more enthusiasm, she said, 
"Food!" She descended on the canapes like a small, smut-nosed girl in a too-large 
leather jacket who had not eaten properly for sometime. Enormous quantities of food 
were immediately crammed into her mouth, masticated and swallowed, while, at the 
same time, the more substantial sandwiches were wrapped in paper napkins and placed 
into her pockets. Then, with a paper plate heaped high with chicken legs, melon slices, 
mushroom vol-au-vents, caviar puffs, and small venison sausages, she began to circle 
the room, staring intently at each and every angelic artefact. 
Richard trailed along behind her, with a Brie and fennel sandwich and a glass of 
freshly squeezed orange juice. 
  
Jessica was deeply puzzled. She had noticed Richard, and having noticed him, she 
had noticed Door. There was something familiar about them both: it was like a tickle at 
the back of her throat, impossible to get rid of, utterly irritating. 
It reminded Jessica of something her mother had once told her about, of how 
Jessica's mother had, one evening, encountered a woman she had known all her life—
had been to school with, had served on the parish council with—and how her mother, 
encountering the woman at a party, had suddenly realized that she was unable to recall 
the woman's name, although she knew the woman had a husband in publishing named 
Eric and a golden retriever named Major. It had left Jessica's mother quite disgruntled. 
It was driving Jessica to distraction. "Who are those people?" she asked Clarence. 
"Them? Well, he's the new editor of Vogue, she's the arts correspondent of the 
New York Times. The one between them is Kate Moss, I think . . . " 
"No, not them," said Jessica. "Them. There." 
Clarence looked in the place that she was pointing. Hm? Oh. Them. He couldn't 
understand how he had failed to see them before. Old age, he thought; he would soon 

be twenty-three. "Journalists?" he said, without much conviction. "They do look rather 
trendoid. Grunge chic? Please. I know I invited The Face . . . " 
"I know him," said Jessica, frustrated. Then Mr. Stockton's chauffeur phoned from 
Holborn to say that he was almost at the British Museum, and Richard slid out of her 
head, like mercury trickling through her fingers. 
"See anything?" asked Richard. Door shook her head and swallowed a mouthful of 
hastily chewed chicken leg. "It's like playing 'Spot the Pigeon' in Trafalgar Square," she 
said. "There's nothing that feels like the Angelus. The paper said I'd know it if I saw it." 
And she wandered off, inspecting angels, pushing her way past a Captain of Industry, 
the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the Highest-Paid Call Girl in the South of 
England. Richard turned away and found himself face-to-face with Jessica. Her hair 
was piled on her head, and it framed her face perfectly in corkscrews of chestnut curls. 
She was very beautiful. She was smiling at him; it was the smile that did it. "Hello 
Jessica," he said. "How are you?" 
"Hello. You won't believe this," she said, "but my assistant failed to make a note 
of your newspaper, Mister uh." 
"Paper?" said Richard. 
"Did I say newspaper?" said Jessica, with a tinkling, sweet, and self-deprecating 
laugh. "Magazine . . . television station. You are with the media?" 
"You're looking very fine, Jessica," said Richard. 
"You have the advantage of me," she said, smiling roguishly. 
"You're Jessica Bartram. You're a marketing executive at Stocktons. You're 
twenty-six. Your birthday is April the twenty-third, and in the throes of extreme passion 
you have a tendency to hum the Monkees song 'I'm a Believer' . . . " 
Jessica was no longer smiling. "Is this some kind of joke?" she asked, coldly. 
"Oh, and we've been engaged for the last eighteen months," said Richard. 
Jessica smiled nervously. Perhaps this really was some kind of joke: one of those 
jokes that everyone else seemed to get and she never did. "I rather think I'd know if I'd 
been engaged to someone for eighteen months, Mister um," said Jessica. 
"Mayhew," said Richard helpfully. "Richard Mayhew. You dumped me, and I 
don't exist anymore." 
Jessica waved, urgently, at no one in particular all the way across the room. "Be 
right there," she called, desperately, and she began to back away. 
"I'm a believer," sang Richard, cheerfully, "I couldn't leave her if I tried . . . " 
Jessica snatched a glass of champagne from a passing tray, downed it in a gulp. At 
the far end of the room she could see Mr. Stockton's chauffeur, and where Mr. 
Stockton's chauffeur was . . .  
She headed toward the doors. "So who was he?" asked Clarence, edging alongside 
her. 
"Who?" 
"Your mystery man." 

"I don't know" she admitted. Then she said, "Look, maybe you ought to call 
security." 
"Okay. Why?" 
"Just . . . just get me security," and then Mr. Arnold Stockton entered the hall, and 
everything else went out of her head. 
  
Expansive, he was, and expensive, a Hogarth cartoon of a man, enormous of girth, 
many-chinned and broad-stomached. He was over sixty; his hair was gray and silver, 
and it was cut too long in the back, because it made people uncomfortable that his hair 
was too long, and Mr. Stockton liked making people uncomfortable. Compared to 
Arnold Stockton, Rupert Murdoch was a shady little pipsqueak, and the late Robert 
Maxwell was a beached whale. Arnold Stockton was a pit bull, which was how 
caricaturists often chose to draw him. Stocktons owned a little bit of everything: 
satellites, newspapers, record companies, amusement parks, books, magazines, comics, 
television stations, film companies. 
"I'll make the speech now," said Mr. Stockton, to Jessica, by way of introduction. 
"Then I'll bugger off. Come back some other time, when there aren't all these stuffed 
shirts about." 
"Right," said Jessica. "Yes. The speech now. Of course." 
And she led him up onto the little stage, up to the podium. She tinked her 
fingernail against a glass, for silence. Nobody heard her, so she said, "Excuse me," into 
the microphone. This time the conversation quieted. "Ladies and gentlemen. Honored 
guests. I'd like to welcome all of you to the British Museum," she said, "to the 
Stockton-sponsored exhibition 'Angels over England,' and to the man behind it all, our 
chief executive and chairman of the board, Mister Arnold Stockton." The guests 
applauded, none of them in any doubt as to who had assembled the collection of angels, 
or, for that matter, paid for their champagne. 
Mr. Stockton cleared his throat. "Okay," he said. "This won't take long. When I 
was a small boy, I used to come to the British Museum on Saturdays, because it was 
free, and we didn't have much money. But I'd come up the big steps to the museum, and 
I'd come down to this room round the back and look up at this angel. It was like it knew 
what I was thinking." 
Just at that moment, Clarence came back in, a couple of security guards beside 
him. He pointed to Richard, who had stopped to listen to Mr. Stockton's speech. Door 
was still examining exhibits. "No, him," Clarence kept saying to the guards, in an 
undertone. "No, look, there. Yes? Him." 
"Anyway. Like anything that's not cared for," continued Mr. Stockton, "it decayed, 
fell apart under the stresses and strains of modern times. Went rotten. Went bad. Well, 
it's taken a shitload of money," he paused, to let it sink in—if he, Arnold Stockton, 
thought it was a shitload, then a shitload it certainly was—"and a dozen craftsmen have 
spent a great deal of time restoring it and fixing it up. After this the exhibition'll be 
going to America, and then around the world, so it maybe can inspire some other little 
penniless brat to start his own communications empire." 

He looked around. Turning to Jessica, he muttered, "What do I do now?" She 
pointed to the pull-rope, at the side of the curtain. Mr. Stockton pulled the rope. The 
curtain billowed and opened, revealing an old door behind it. 
Again, there was a small flurry of activity in Clarence's corner of the room. "No. 
Him," said Clarence. "For heaven's sake. Are you blind?" 
It looked like it had once been the door to a cathedral. It was the height of two 
men, and wide enough for a pony to walk through. Carved into the wood of the door, 
and painted with red and white and gold leaf, was an extraordinary angel. It stared out 
at the world with blank medieval eyes. There was an impressed gasp from the guests, 
then they began to applaud. 
"The Angelus." Door tugged at Richard's sleeve. "That's it! Richard, come on." She 
ran for the stage. 
"Excuse me, sir," said a guard to Richard. "Might we see your invitation?" said 
another, taking Richard firmly but discreetly by the arm. "And do you have any 
identification?" 
"No," said Richard. 
Door was up on the stage. Richard tried to yank free and follow her, hoping that 
the guards would forget about him. They didn't: now that he had been brought to their 
attention they were going to proceed to treat him as they might any other shabby, 
unwashed, somewhat unshaven gate-crasher. The guard who was holding Richard 
increased his grip on his arm, muttering, "None of that." 
Door paused on the stage, wondering how to make the guards let Richard go. Then 
she did the only thing she could think of. She went over to the microphone, went up on 
tiptoes, and she screamed, as loudly as she possibly could, into the public-address 
system. She had a remarkable scream: it could, with no artificial assistance, go through 
your head like a new power drill with a bone-saw attachment. And amplified . . . It was 
simply unearthly. 
A waitress dropped her tray of drinks. Heads turned. Hands covered ears. All 
conversation stopped. People stared at the stage in puzzlement and horror. And Richard 
made a break for it. "Sorry," he said to the stunned guard, as he yanked his arm out of 
the man's grip, and fled. "Wrong London." He reached the stage, grabbed Door's 
outstretched left hand. Her right hand touched the Angelus, the enormous cathedral 
door. Touched it, and opened it. 
This time no one dropped any drinks. They were frozen, staring, utterly 
overwhelmed—and, momentarily, blinded. The Angelus had opened, and light, from 
behind the door, had flooded the room with radiance. People covered their eyes then, 
hesitantly, opened them again, and simply stared. It was as if fireworks had been let off 
in the room. Not indoor fireworks, strange crawling things that sputter and smell bad; 
nor even the kind of fireworks that you set off in your back yard; but the kind of 
industrial-strength fireworks that get fired up high enough to cause a potential menace 
to the airways: the kind of fireworks that end a day at Disney World, or that give the 
fire marshals headaches at Pink Floyd concerts. It was a moment of pure magic. 
The audience stared, entranced and amazed. The only noise to be heard was the 
gentle, gasping almost-groan of wonderment that people make when they watch 

fireworks: the sound of awe. Then a grubby young man and a dirty-faced girl in a huge 
leather jacket walked into the light show and vanished. The door closed, behind them. 
The light show was over. 
And everything was normal again. The guests, and guards, and serving staff, 
blinked, shook their respective heads, and, having dealt with something entirely outside 
of their experience, agreed, somehow, without a word, that it had simply never 
happened. The string quartet began to play once more. 
Mr. Stockton walked off, nodding brusquely to various acquaintances as he did so. 
Jessica walked over, to Clarence. "What," she asked, quietly, "are those security guards 
doing in here?" 
The guards in question were standing among the guests, looking around as if they 
were themselves unsure what they were doing there. Clarence began to explain just 
what the guards were doing there; and then he realized he had absolutely no idea. "I'll 
deal with it," said Clarence, efficiently. 
Jessica nodded. She looked out over her party and smiled benignly. It was all 
going rather well. 
  
Richard and Door walked into the light. And then it was dark, and chill, and 
Richard was blinking at the retinal afterimage of the light, which left him almost 
blinded: a ghostly series of orange-green splotches that slowly faded, as his eyes 
accustomed themselves to the darkness that surrounded them. 
They were in a huge hall, carved from rock. Iron pillars, black and rust-dusted, 
held up the roof, went off into the distant dark, perhaps for miles. From somewhere he 
could hear the gentle splash of water: a fountain, perhaps, or a spring. Door was still 
holding his hand, tightly. In the distance, a tiny flame flickered and flared. And another, 
and then another: it was a host of candles, flickering into flame, Richard realized. And 
walking toward them, through the candles, was a tall figure, dressed in a simple white 
robe. 
The figure seemed to be moving slowly, but it must have been walking very fast, 
as it was only seconds before it was standing beside them. It had golden hair and a pale 
face. It was not much taller than Richard, but it made him feel like a little child. It was 
not a man; it was not a woman. It was very beautiful. Its voice was quiet. It said, "The 
Lady Door, yes?" 
Door said, "Yes." 
A gentle smile. It nodded its head to her, almost humbly. "It is an honor finally to 
meet you and your companion. I am the Angel Islington." Its eyes were clear and wide. 
Its robes were not white, as Richard had initially thought: they seemed to have been 
woven from light. 
Richard did not believe in angels, he never had. He was damned if he was going to 
start now. Still, it was much easier not to believe in something when it was not actually 
looking directly at you and saying your name. "Richard Mayhew," it said. "You, too, 
are welcome here, in my halls." It turned away. "Please," it said. "Follow me." 
Richard and Door followed the angel through the caverns. The candles 
extinguished themselves behind them. 

  
The marquis de Carabas strode through the empty hospital, broken glass and old 
syringes crunching beneath his square-toed black motorcycle boots. He stepped through 
a double door that led into a back staircase. He went down the stair's, to the cellars 
beneath the hospital. 
He walked through the rooms beneath the building, stepping fastidiously around 
the heaps of moldering rubbish. He walked through the showers and the toilets, down 
an old iron staircase, through a wet, swampy place; and then pulled open a half-rotted 
wooden door, and went inside. He looked around the room in which he found himself; 
he inspected, with magnificent disdain, the half-eaten kitten and the heap of razor 
blades. Then he cleared the debris off a chair, sat down, comfortably, luxuriantly, in the 
dankness of the cellar, and closed his eyes. 
Eventually the door to the cellar was opened and people came in. 
The marquis de Carabas opened his eyes and yawned. Then he flashed Mr. Croup 
and Mr. Vandemar a huge smile. "Hello boys," said de Carabas. "I thought it high time 
I came down here to talk to you in person." 

TEN 
"Do you drink wine?" it asked. 
Richard nodded. 
"I had a little wine once," said Door, hesitantly. "My father. He. At dinner. Would 
let us taste it." 
The Angel Islington lifted the bottle: it looked like some kind of decanter. Richard 
wondered if the bottle was made of glass; it refracted and reflected the candlelight so 
strangely. Perhaps it was some kind of crystal, or one huge diamond. It even made it 
seem that the wine inside was glowing, as if it were made of light. 
The angel took the top off the crystal and poured an inch of the liquid inside it into 
a wine glass. It was a white wine, but a wine unlike any Richard had ever seen. It threw 
light around the caverns, like sunlight on a swimming pool. 
Door and Richard sat around an age-blackened wooden table, on huge wooden 
chairs, and said nothing. "This wine," said Islington, "is the last bottle of its kind. I was 
given a dozen bottles by one of your ancestors." 
It handed the glass to Door, and began to pour another inch of the glowing wine 
from the decanter into another glass. It did this reverently, almost lovingly, like a priest 
performing a ritual. "It was a welcome gift. This was, oh, thirty, forty thousand years 
ago. Quite a while ago, at any rate." It passed the wine glass to Richard. "I suppose that 
you could accuse me of squandering something I should treasure," it told them. "But I 
receive guests so rarely. And the way here is hard." 
"The Angelus . . . " murmured Door. 
"You traveled here using the Angelus, yes. But that way works only once for each 
traveler." The angel raised its glass high, staring at the light. "Drink it carefully," it 
advised them. "It is most potent." It sat down at the table, between Richard and Door. 
"When one tastes it," it said, wistfully, "I like to imagine that one is actually tasting the 
sunlight of bygone days." It held up its glass. "A toast: to former glories." 
"Former glories," chorused Richard and Door. And then, a little warily, they tasted 
the wine, sipping it, not drinking. 
"It's amazing," said Door. 
"It really is," said Richard. "I thought old wines turned to vinegar when they were 
exposed to air." 
The angel shook its head. "Not this one. It is all a matter of the type of grape and 
the place it was grown. This kind of grape, alas, perished when the vineyard vanished 
beneath the waves." 
"It's magical," said Door, sipping the liquid light. "I've never tasted anything like 
it." 
"And you never will again," said Islington. "There is no more wine from Atlantis." 
Somewhere inside Richard a small, reasonable voice pointed out that there never 
was an Atlantis, and, thus emboldened, went on to state that there were no such things 
as angels, and that furthermore, most of his experiences of the last few days had been 

impossible. Richard ignored it. He was learning, awkwardly, to trust his instincts, and 
to realize that the simplest and most likely explanations for what he had seen and 
experienced recently were the ones that had been offered to him—no matter how 
unlikely they might seem. He opened his mouth and tasted the wine once more. It made 
him feel happy. It made him think of skies bigger and bluer than any he had ever seen, 
a golden sun hanging huge in the sky; everything simpler, everything younger than the 
world he knew. 
There was a waterfall to the left of them; clear water ran down the rock and 
collected in the rock-pool. To the right of them was a door, set between two iron pillars: 
the door was made of polished flint set in a metal that was almost black. 
"You really claim to be an angel?" Richard asked. "I mean, you've actually met 
God and everything?" 
Islington smiled. "I claim nothing, Richard," it said. "But I am an angel." 
"You honor us," said Door. 
"No. You do me much honor by coming here. Your father was a good man, Door, 
and a friend to me. I was deeply saddened by his death." 
"He said . . . in his journal . . . he said I should come to you. He said I could trust 
you." 
"I only hope that I can be worthy of that trust." The angel sipped its wine. "London 
Below is the second city that I have cared for. The first sank beneath the waves, and 
there was nothing I could do to prevent it. I know what pain is, and loss. You have my 
sympathies. What would you like to know?" 
Door paused. "My family . . . they were killed by Croup and Vandemar. But—who 
ordered it? I want . . . I want to know why." 
The angel nodded. "Many secrets find their way down to me," it said. "Many 
rumors, and half-truths, and echoes." Then it turned to Richard. "And you? What do 
you want, Richard Mayhew?" 
Richard shrugged. "I want my life back. And my apartment. And my job." 
"That can happen," said the angel. 
"Yeah. Right," said Richard flatly. 
"Do you doubt me, Richard Mayhew?" asked the Angel Islington. 
Richard looked into its eyes. They were a luminescent gray, eyes as old as the 
universe, eyes that had seen galaxies congeal from stardust ten million, million years 
ago; Richard shook his head. Islington smiled at him, kindly. "It will not be easy, and 
you and your companions will face some very real difficulties, both in the task, and in 
the return. But there could be a way that we can learn: a key to all of our problems." 
It got up, and walked over to a small rock shelf, where it picked up a figurine, one 
of several on the shelf. It was a small black statuette depicting some kind of animal, 
made of volcanic glass. The angel handed it to Door. "This will bring you safely 
through the last stage of your journey back to me," it said. "The rest is up to you." 
"What do you want us to do?" asked Richard. 
"The Black Friars are custodians of a key," it said. "Bring it to me." 
"And you can use it to find out who killed my family?" asked Door. 

"I hope so," said the angel. Richard finished his glass of wine. He felt it warming 
him, running through him. He had the strange feeling that if he looked down at his 
fingers he would be able to see the wine glowing through them. As if he were made of 
light . . .  
"Good luck," whispered the Angel Islington. There was a rushing sound, like a 
wind soughing across a lost forest, or the beating of mighty wings. 
  
Richard and Door were sitting on the floor in a room in the British Museum, 
staring up at a carved painting of an angel on a cathedral door. The room was dark and 
empty. The party had been over for a long time. The sky outside was beginning to 
lighten. Richard stood up, then leaned down, and helped Door up. 
"Black Friars?" he asked. Door nodded. 
He had crossed Blackfriars Bridge, in the City of London, many times, and he had 
often passed through Blackfriars station, but he had learned by now not to assume 
anything. "People." 
Richard walked over to the Angelus. He ran a finger down its painted robe. "Do 
you think he can really do it? Get me my life back?" 
"I've never heard of such a thing. But I don't think he would have lied to us. He is 
an angel." 
Door opened her hand, looked at the statue of the Beast. "My father had one of 
these," she said, sadly. She put it deep in one of the pockets of her brown leather jacket. 
"Well," said Richard. "We're not going to get the key back by lollygagging around 
here, are we?" They walked through the empty museum corridors. 
"So what do you know about this key then?" asked Richard. 
"Nothing," said Door. They had reached the main doors of the museum. "I've 
heard of the Black Friars, but I've never actually had anything to do with them." She 
pressed her fingers against a seriously locked glass door, which swung open at her 
touch. 
"A bunch of monks . . . " said Richard, thoughtfully. "I bet if we just tell them it's 
for an angel, a real one, they'll give us the sacred key, and—and throw in the magic 
can-opener and the amazing whistling corkscrew, as a surprise bonus." He began to 
laugh. He wondered if the wine was still affecting him. 
"You're in good spirits," said Door. 
He nodded, enthusiastically. "I'm going to go home. Everything is going to be 
normal again. Boring again. Wonderful again." Richard looked at the stone steps that 
lead up the British Museum, and decided that they were made to be danced down by 
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. And seeing that neither of them happened to be 
available, he began to dance down the steps, doing a Fred Astaire impersonation, while 
humming something approximately halfway between "Puttin' on the Ritz" and "Top 
Hat, White Tie, and Tails." "Ya-ta-ta-da-da-ta-ta-ya," he sang, soft-shoeing down the 
steps and up again. 

Door stood at the top of the steps, staring at him in horror. Then she began to 
giggle, helplessly. He looked up at her and doffed his imaginary white silk top hat to 
her, mimed tossing it high in the air, catching it, and putting it back on his head. 
"Twit," said Door, and smiled at him. In response, Richard grabbed her hand and 
continued dancing up and down the steps. Door hesitated for a moment, then she, too, 
began to dance. She danced much better than Richard did. At the bottom of the steps 
they tumbled, breathless and exhausted and giggling, into each other's arms. 
Richard felt his world spin. 
He felt her heart beating against his chest. The moment began to transmute, and he 
wondered if there was something he should do. He wondered if he should kiss her. He 
wondered if he wanted to kiss her, and he realized that he truly did not know. He 
looked into her amazing eyes. Door put her head on one side, and pulled free. She 
pulled up the collar on her brown leather jacket, pulled it around her: armor and 
protection. 
"Let's go and find our bodyguard," said Door. And they walked away together, 
down the sidewalk, toward British Museum Station, stumbling only a little from time to 
time. 
  
"What," asked Mr. Croup, "do you want?" 
"What," asked the marquis de Carabas, a little more rhetorically, "does anyone 
want?" 
"Dead things," suggested Mr. Vandemar. "Extra teeth." 
"I thought perhaps we could make a deal," said the marquis. 
Mr. Croup began to laugh. It sounded like a piece of blackboard being dragged 
over the nails of a wall of severed fingers. "Oh, Messire Marquis. I think I can 
confidently state, with no risk of contradiction from any parties here present, that you 
have taken leave of whatever senses you are reputed to have had. You are," he 
confided, "if you will permit the vulgarism, completely off your head." 
"Say the word," said Mr. Vandemar, who was now standing behind the marquis's 
chair, "and it'll be off his neck before you can say Jack Ketch." 
The marquis breathed heavily on his fingernails and polished them on the lapel of 
his coat. "I have always felt," he said, "that violence was the last refuge of the 
incompetent, and empty threats the final sanctuary of the terminally inept." 
Mr. Croup glared. "What are you doing here?" he hissed. 
The marquis de Carabas stretched, like a big cat: a lynx, perhaps, or a huge black 
panther; and at the end of the stretch he was standing up, with his hands thrust deep in 
the pockets of his magnificent coat. "You are," he said, idly and conversationally, "I 
understand, Mister Croup, a collector of T'ang dynasty figurines." 
"How did you know that?" 
"People tell me things. I'm approachable." The marquis's smile was pure, 
untroubled, guileless: the smile of a man selling you a used Bible. 
"Even if I were . . . " began Mr. Croup. 

"If you were," said the marquis de Carabas, "you might be interested in this." He 
took one hand out of his pocket and displayed it to Mr. Croup. Until earlier that evening 
it had sat in a glass case in the vaults of one of London's leading merchant banks. It was 
listed in certain catalogues as The Spirit of Autumn (Grave Figure). It was roughly eight 
inches high: a piece of glazed pottery that had been shaped and painted and fired while 
Europe was in the Dark Ages, six hundred years before Columbus's first voyage. 
Mr. Croup hissed, involuntarily, and reached for it. The marquis pulled it out of 
reach, cradled it to his chest. "No no," said the marquis. "It's not as simple as that." 
"No?" asked Mr. Croup. "But what's to stop us taking it, and leaving pieces of you 
all over the Underside? We've never dismembered a marquis before." 
"Have," said Mr. Vandemar. "In York. In the fourteenth century. In the rain." 
"He wasn't a marquis," said Mr. Croup. "He was the earl of Exeter." 
"And marquis of Westmorland." Mr. Vandemar looked rather pleased with 
himself. 
Mr. Croup sniffed. "What's to stop us hacking you into as many pieces as we 
hacked the marquis of Westmorland?" he asked. 
De Carabas took his other hand out of his pocket. It held a small hammer. He 
tossed the hammer in the air and caught it by the handle, ending with the hammer 
poised over the china figurine. "Oh, please," he said. "No more silly threats. I think I'd 
feel better if you were both standing back over there." 
Mr. Vandemar shot a look at Mr. Croup, who nodded, almost imperceptibly. There 
was a tremble in the air, and Mr. Vandemar was standing beside Mr. Croup, who 
smiled like a skull. "I have indeed been known to purchase the occasional T'ang piece," 
he admitted. "Is that for sale?" 
"We don't go in so much for buying and selling here in the Underside, Mister 
Croup. Barter. Exchange. That's what we look for. But yes, indeed, this desirable little 
piece is certainly up for grabs." 
Mr. Croup pursed his lips. He folded his arms. He unfolded them. He ran one hand 
through his greasy hair. Then, "Name your price," said Mr. Croup. The marquis let 
himself breathe a deep, relieved, and almost audible sigh. It was possible that he was 
going to be able to pull this whole grandiose ruse off, after all. "First, three answers to 
three questions," he said. 
Croup nodded. "Each way. We get three answers too." 
"Fair enough," said the marquis. "Secondly, I get safe conduct out of here. And 
you agree to give me at least an hour's head start." 
Croup nodded violently. "Agreed. Ask your first question." His gaze was fixed on 
the statue. 
"First question. Who are you working for?" 
"Oh, that's an easy one," said Mr. Croup. "That's a simple answer. We are working 
for our employer, who wishes to remain nameless." 
"Hmph. Why did you kill Door's family?" 
"Orders from our employer," said Mr. Croup, his smile becoming more foxy by 
the moment. 

"Why didn't you kill Door, when you had a chance?" 
Before Mr. Croup could answer, Mr. Vandemar said, "Got to keep her alive. She's 
the only one that can open the door." 
Mr. Croup glared up at his associate. "That's it," he said. "Tell him everything, 
why don't you?" 
"I wanted a turn," muttered Mr. Vandemar. 
"Right," said Mr. Croup. "So you've got three answers, for all the good that will do 
you. My first question: why are you protecting her?" 
"Her father saved my life," said the marquis, honestly. "I never paid off my debt to 
him. I prefer debts to be in my favor." 
"I've got a question," said Mr. Vandemar. 
"As have I, Mr. Vandemar. The Upworlder, Richard Mayhew. Why is he traveling 
with her? Why does she permit it?" 
"Sentimentality on her part," said the marquis de Carabas. He wondered, as he said 
it, if that was the whole truth. He had begun to wonder whether there might, perhaps, be 
more to the upworlder than met the eye. 
"Now me," said Mr. Vandemar. "What number am I thinking of?" 
"I beg your pardon?" 
"What number am I thinking of?" repeated Mr. Vandemar. "It's between one and a 
lot," he added, helpfully. 
"Seven," said the marquis. Mr. Vandemar nodded, impressed. Mr. Croup began, 
"Where is the—" but the marquis shook his head. "Uh-uh," he said. "Now we're getting 
greedy." 
There was a moment of utter silence, in that dank cellar. Then once more water 
dripped, and maggots rustled; and the marquis said, "An hour's head start, remember." 
"Of course," said Mr. Croup. The marquis de Carabas tossed the figurine to Mr. 
Croup, who caught it eagerly, like an addict catching a plastic baggie filled with white 
powder of dubious legality. And then, without a backward glance, the marquis left the 
cellar. 
Mr. Croup examined the figurine minutely, turning it over and over in his hands, a 
Dickensian curator of the Museum of the Damned contemplating a prize exhibit. His 
tongue flicked out, from time to time, like a snake's. A perceptible flush appeared on 
his pallid cheeks. "Oh, fine, fine'," he whispered. "T'ang dynasty indeed. Twelve 
hundred years old, the finest pottery figurines ever made on this earth. This was created 
by Kai Lung, finest of potters: there is not a twin to it in existence. Examine the color 
of the glaze; the sense of proportion; the life . . . " He was smiling now, like a baby; the 
innocent smile looked lost and confused on the shady terrain of Mr. Croup's face. "It 
adds a little wonder and beauty to the world." 
And then he grinned, too widely, and lowered his face to the figurine, and crushed 
its head in his teeth, chomping and chewing wildly, swallowing in lumps. His teeth 
ground the china to a fine powder, which dusted the lower part of his face. 
He gloried in its destruction, throwing himself into it with the strange madness and 
uncontrolled blood lust of a fox in a henhouse. And then, when the statue was nothing 

but dust, he turned to Mr. Vandemar. He seemed strangely mellow, almost languid. 
"How long did we say we'd give him?" 
"An hour." 
"Mmm. And how long has it been?" 
"Six minutes." 
Mr. Croup lowered his head. He ran a finger across his chin, licked the powdered 
clay from his fingertip. "You follow him, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup. "I need a 
little more time in which to savor the occasion." 
  
Hunter could hear them walking down the steps. She was standing in the shadows, 
with her arms folded, in the same position she had been in when they left her. Richard 
was humming loudly. Door was giggling helplessly; then she would stop, and tell 
Richard to be quiet. Then she would start giggling again. They walked past Hunter 
without noticing her. She stepped out of the shadows, and said, "You have been gone 
for eight hours." It was a statement of fact, without reproach or curiosity. 
Door blinked at her. "It didn't seem that long." Hunter said nothing. 
Richard grinned wearily at her. "Don't you want to know what happened? Well, 
we got ambushed by Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar. Unfortunately we didn't have 
a bodyguard around. Still, I gave them a good run for their money." 
Hunter raised a perfect eyebrow. "I am in awe of your pugilistic talents," she said 
coolly. 
Door giggled. "He's kidding. Actually—they killed us." 
"As an expert in the termination of bodily functions," Hunter said, "I must beg to 
differ. You are neither of you dead. At a guess, you are both very drunk." 
Door stuck her tongue out at her bodyguard. "Nonsense. Touched hardly a drop. 
That much." She held out two fingers to show how tiny an amount "that much" was. 
"Just went to a party," said Richard, "and saw Jessica and saw a real angel and got 
a little black pig and came back here." 
"Just a little drink," continued Door, intently. "Old, old drink. Tiiiiny little drink. 
Very small. Almost not there." She began to hiccup. Then she giggled again. A hiccup 
interrupted her, and she sat down suddenly on the platform. "I think maybe we are a bit 
smashed," she said, soberly. Then she closed her eyes, and began, solemnly, to snore. 
  
The marquis de Carabas was running through the underways as if all the hounds of 
Hell had his scent and were on his trail. He was splashing through six gray inches of the 
Tyburn, the hangman's river, kept safe in the darkness in a brick sewer beneath Park 
Lane on its way south to Buckingham Palace. He had been running for seventeen 
minutes. 
Thirty feet below Marble Arch, he paused. The sewer divided into two branches. 
The marquis de Carabas ran down the left-hand branch. 
Several minutes later, Mr. Vandemar walked through the sewer. And when he 
reached the junction he, too, paused for a few moments, sniffing the air. And then he, 
too, walked down the left-hand branch. 

  
Hunter dropped Richard Mayhew's unconscious body into a pile of straw, with a 
grunt. He rolled in the straw, said something that sounded like "Forth-ril bjugly mobble 
wug," and went back to sleep. She put Door down in the straw next to him, more 
gently. Then she stood beside Door, in the dark stables under the ground, on guard still. 
  
The marquis de Carabas was exhausted. He leaned against the tunnel wall and 
stared at the steps that went up ahead of him. Then he pulled out the golden pocket-
watch and looked at the time. Thirty-five minutes had passed since he had fled the 
hospital cellar. 
"Is it an hour yet?" asked Mr. Vandemar. He was sitting on the steps ahead of the 
marquis, picking his nails with a knife. 
"Not even close," gasped the marquis. 
"Felt like an hour," said Mr. Vandemar, helpfully. 
There was a shiver in the world, and Mr. Croup stood behind the marquis de 
Carabas. He still had powder on his chin. De Carabas stared at Mr. Croup. He turned 
back to look at Mr. Vandemar. And then, spontaneously, the marquis de Carabas began 
to laugh. Mr. Croup smiled. "You find us funny, Messire Marquis, do you not? A 
source of amusement. Is that not so? With our pretty clothes, and our convoluted 
circumlocutions—" 
Mr. Vandemar murmured, "I haven't got a circumlo . . . " 
"—and our little sillinesses of manner and behavior. And perhaps we are funny." 
Mr. Croup raised one finger then, and waggled it at de Carabas. "But you must 
never imagine," he continued, "that just because something is funny, Messire Marquis, 
it is not also dangerous." 
And Mr. Vandemar threw his knife at the marquis, hard and accurately. It hit him, 
hilt first, on the temple. His eyes rolled up in his head, and his knees buckled. 
"Circumlocution," said Mr. Croup to Mr. Vandemar. "It's a way of speaking around 
something. A digression. Verbosity." 
Mr. Vandemar picked up the marquis de Carabas by his waistband and dragged 
him up the stairs, his head bump-bump-bumping on each step as they went, and Mr. 
Vandemar nodded. "I wondered," he said. 
  
Watching their dreams, now, as they sleep. 
Hunter sleeps standing up. 
In her dream, Hunter is in the undercity beneath Bangkok. It is partly a maze, and 
partly a forest, for the wilderness of Thailand has retreated deep beneath the ground, 
under the airport and the hotels and the streets. The world smells of spice and dried 
mango, and it also smells, not unpleasantly, of sex. It is humid, and she is sweating. It is 
dark, broken by phosphorescent patches on the wall, greenish grey fungi that give light 
enough to fool the eye, light enough to walk by. 

In her dream Hunter moves silent as a ghost through the wet tunnels, pushing her 
way through vegetation. She holds a weighted throwing stick in her right hand; a 
leather shield covers her left forearm. 
She smells it, in her dream, acrid and animal, and she pauses beside a wall of 
ruined masonry, and she waits, part of the shadows, one with the darkness. Hunting, 
like life, Hunter believes, consists chiefly of waiting. In Hunter's dream, however, she 
does not wait. Upon her arrival, it comes through the underbrush, a fury of brown and 
of white, undulating gently, like a wet-furred snake, its red eyes bright and peering 
through the darkness, its teeth like needles, a carnivore and a killer. The creature is 
extinct in the world above. It weighs almost three hundred pounds, and is a little over 
fifteen feet long, from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail. 
As it passes her, she hisses like a snake, and, momentarily, old instincts kicking in, 
it freezes. And then it leaps at her, nothing but hate and sharp teeth. She remembers, 
then, in her dream, that this had happened before, and that when it had happened, that 
time in the past, she had pushed the leather arm-shield into its mouth and crushed its 
skull with the leaden throwing stick taking care not to damage the pelt. She had given 
the Great Weasel's pelt to a girl who had caught her eye, and the girl had been 
appropriately grateful. 
But now, in her dream, that is not happening. Instead, the weasel is reaching out a 
forepaw toward her, and she is dropping her throwing stick and taking its paw. And 
then and there, in the undercity beneath Bangkok, they are dancing together, in one 
intricate unending dance: and Hunter is watching them from outside herself, and she is 
admiring the elaborate movements they make as they move, tail and legs and arms and 
fingers and eyes and hair all tumbling and twisting powerfully and strangely into the 
underneath and out across forever. 
There is a tiny noise in the waking world, a dreaming whimper from the child 
Door, and Hunter moves from sleeping to waking fluidly and instantly; she is alert once 
more, and on guard. She forgets her dream entirely upon waking. 
  
Door is dreaming of her father. 
In her dream, he is showing her how to open things. He picks up an orange, and 
gestures: in one smooth movement it inverts, and twists: the orange flesh is on the 
outside, now, and the skin is in the center, on the inside. One must always maintain 
parity, her father tells her, peeling off an inside-out orange segment for her. Parity, 
symmetry, topology: these will be our subjects for the months to come, Door. But the 
most important thing for you to understand is this: all things want to open. You must 
feel that need, and use it. Her father's hair is brown and thick, as it was a decade before 
his death, and he has an easy smile, which she remembers but which time had 
diminished as the years went on. 
In her dream, he passes her a padlock. She takes it from him. Her hands are the 
size and shape of her hands today, although she knows that, in truth, this occurred when 
she was a tiny child, that she is taking moments and conversations and lessons from 
over a dozen years and is compressing them into one lesson. Open it, he tells her. 
She holds it in her hand, feeling the cold metal, feeling the weight of the lock in 
her hands. Something is bothering her. There is something she has to know. Door 

learned to open some time after she learned to walk. She remembers her mother holding 
her tightly, opening a door from Door's bedroom to the playroom, remembers watching 
her brother Arch separating linked silver rings, joining them back together. 
She tries to open the padlock. She fumbles at it with her fingers, and with her 
mind. Nothing happens. She throws the padlock down onto the floor and begins to cry. 
Her father reaches down and picks up the padlock, puts it back into her hand. His long 
finger brushes away a tear from her cheek. 
Remember, he tells her, the padlock wants to open. All you have to do is let it do 
what it wants. 
It sits there in her hand, cold and inert and heavy. And then, suddenly, she 
understands, and, somewhere in her heart, she lets it be what it wants to be. There is a 
loud click, and the padlock opens. Her father is smiling. There, she says. 
Good girl, says her father. That's all there is to opening. Everything else is just 
technique. 
She realizes what it is that is bothering her. Father? she asks. Your journal. Who 
put it away? Who could have hidden it? But he is receding from her, and already she is 
forgetting. She calls to him, but he cannot hear her, and although she can hear his voice 
in the distance, she can no longer make out what he is saying. 
In the waking world, Door whimpers softly. Then she rolls over, cradles her arm 
around her face, snorts once, twice, then sleeps once more, sleeps without dreaming. 
  
Richard knows it waits for them. Each tunnel he goes down, each turning, each 
branch he walks, the feeling grows in urgency and weight. He knows it is there, 
waiting, and the sense of impending catastrophe increases with every step. He knows 
that it should have been a relief when he turns the final corner, and sees it standing 
there, framed in the tunnel, waiting for him. Instead he feels only dread. In his dream it 
is the size of the world: there is nothing left in the world but the Beast, its flanks 
steaming, broken spars and juts of old weapons prickling from its hide. There is dried 
blood on its horns and on its tusks. It is gross, and vast, and evil. And then it charges. 
He raises his hand (but it isn't his hand) and he throws the spear at the creature. 
He sees its eyes, wet and vicious and gloating, as they float toward him, all in a 
fraction of a second that becomes a tiny forever. And then it is upon him . . .  
The water was cold, and it hit Richard's face like a slap. His eyes jerked open, and 
he caught his breath. Hunter was looking down at him. She was holding a large wooden 
bucket. It was empty. He reached up one hand. His hair was soaked, and his face was 
wet. He wiped the water from his eyes and shivered with cold. 
"You didn't have to do that," said Richard. His mouth tasted like several small 
animals had been using it as a rest room. He tried to stand, and then he sat down again, 
suddenly. "Ooh," he explained. "How's your head?" asked Hunter, professionally. 
"It's been better," said Richard. 
Hunter picked up another wooden bucket, this one filled with water, and hauled it 
across the stable floor. "I don't know what you drank," she said. "But it must have been 
potent." Hunter dipped her hand into the bucket and flicked it at Door's face, spraying 
her with water. Door's eyes flickered. 

"No wonder Atlantis sank," muttered Richard. "If they all felt like this in the 
morning it was probably a relief. Where are we?" 
Hunter flicked another handful of water at Door's face. "In the stables of a friend," 
she said. Richard looked around. The place did look a little like a stable. He wondered 
if it were for horses—and if so, what kind of horses would live beneath the ground? 
There was a device painted on the wall: the letter S (or was it a snake? Richard could 
not tell) circled by seven stars. 
Door reached a tentative hand up to her head and touched it, experimentally, as if 
she were unsure just what she might find. "Ooh," she said, in a near-whisper. "Temple 
and Arch. Am I dead?" 
"No," said Hunter. 
"Pity." 
Hunter helped her to a standing position. "Well," said Door, sleepily, "he did warn 
us it was strong." And then Door woke up completely, very hard, very fast. She 
grabbed Richard's shoulder, pointed to the device on the wall, the snaky S with the stars 
surrounding it. She gasped. "Serpentine," she said to Richard, to Hunter. "That's 
Serpentine's crest. Richard, get up! We have to run—before she finds out we're here . . . 
" 
"And do you think," asked a dry voice from the doorway, "that you could enter 
Serpentine's house without Serpentine knowing, child?" 
Door pushed herself back against the wood of the stable wall. She was trembling. 
Richard realized, through the pounding in his head, that he had never seen Door so 
actually and obviously scared before. Serpentine stood in the doorway. She was 
wearing a white leather corset and high white leather boots, and the remains of what 
looked like it had once, long ago, been a silk-and-lace confection of a white wedding 
dress, now shredded and dirt-stained and torn. She towered above them all: her shock 
of graying hair brushed the door lintel. Her eyes were sharp, and her mouth was a cruel 
slash in an imperious face. She looked at Door as if she took terror as her due; as if she 
had become so used to fear that she now expected it, even liked it. 
"Calm yourself," said Hunter. 
"But she's Serpentine," wailed Door. "Of the Seven Sisters." 
Serpentine inclined her head, cordially. Then she stepped out of the doorway and 
walked toward them. Behind her was a thin woman with a severe face and long dark 
hair, wearing a black dress pinched wasp-thin at the waist. The woman said nothing. 
Serpentine walked over to Hunter. "Hunter worked for me long ago," said Serpentine. 
She reached out a white finger and gently stroked Hunter's brown cheek with it, a 
gesture of affection and possession. And then, "You've kept your looks better than I, 
Hunter." Hunter looked down. "Her friends are my friends, child," said Serpentine. 
"You are Door?" 
"Yes," said Door, dry-mouthed. 
Serpentine turned on Richard. "And what are you?" she asked, unimpressed. 
"Richard," said Richard. 
"I am Serpentine," she told him, graciously. 

"So I gathered," said Richard. 
"There is food waiting for all of you," said Serpentine, "should you wish to break 
your fast." 
"Oh God no," whimpered Richard politely. Door said nothing. She was still 
backed against the wall, still trembling gently, like a leaf in an autumn breeze. The fact 
that Hunter had clearly brought them here as a safe haven was doing nothing to assuage 
her fear. 
"What is there to eat?" asked Hunter. 
Serpentine looked at the-wasp-waisted woman in the doorway. "Well?" she asked. 
The woman smiled the chilliest smile Richard had ever seen cross a human face, then 
she said, "Fried eggs poached eggs pickled eggs curried venison pickled onions pickled 
herrings smoked herrings salted herrings mushroom stew salted bacon stuffed cabbage 
calves-foot jelly—" 
Richard opened his. mouth to plead with her to stop, but it was too late. He was 
suddenly, violently, awfully sick. 
He wanted someone to hold him, to tell him that everything would be all right, that 
he'd soon be feeling better; someone to give him an aspirin and a glass of water, and 
show him back to his bed. But nobody did; and his bed was another life away. He 
washed the sick from his face and hands with water from the bucket. Then he washed 
out his mouth. Then, swaying gently, he followed the four women to breakfast. 
  
"Pass the calves-foot jelly," said Hunter, with her mouth full. Serpentine's dining 
room was on what appeared to be the smallest Underground platform that Richard had 
ever seen. It was about twelve feet long, and much of that space was taken up with a 
dinner table. A white damask cloth was laid on the table, and a formal silver dinner-
service on that. The table was piled high with evil-smelling foodstuffs. The pickled 
quails' eggs, thought Richard, smelled the worst. 
His skin felt clammy, and his eyes felt like they had been put in their sockets 
wrong, while his skull gave him the general impression that someone had removed it 
while he had slept and swapped it for another two or three sizes too small. An 
Underground train went past a few feet from them; the wind of its passage whipped at 
the table. The noise of its passage went through Richard's head like a hot knife through 
brains. Richard groaned. 
"Your hero is unable to hold his wine, I see," observed Serpentine, 
dispassionately. 
"He's not my hero," said Door. 
"I'm afraid he is. You learn to recognize the type. Something in the eyes, perhaps." 
She turned to the woman in black, who appeared to be some kind of majordomo. "A 
restorative for the gentleman." The woman smiled thinly and glided away. 
Door picked at a mushroom dish. "We are very grateful for all this, Lady 
Serpentine," she said. 
Serpentine sniffed. "Just Serpentine, child. I have no time for silly honorifics and 
imaginary titles. So. You're Portico's oldest girl." 

"Yes." 
Serpentine dipped her finger in the briny sauce that held what appeared to be 
several small eels. She licked her finger, nodded approvingly. "I had little time for your 
father. All that foolishness about uniting the Underside. Stuff and nonsense. Silly man. 
Just asking for trouble. The last time I saw your father, I told him that if he ever came 
back here, I'd turn him into a blindworm." She turned to Door. "How is your father, by 
the way?" 
"He's dead," said Door. 
Serpentine looked perfectly satisfied. "See?" she said. "My point exactly." Door 
said nothing. Serpentine picked at something that was moving in her gray hair. She 
examined it closely, crushed it between finger and thumb, and dropped it onto the 
platform. Then she turned to Hunter, who was demolishing a small hill of pickled 
herrings. "You're Beast-hunting then?" she said. Hunter nodded, her mouth full. "You'll 
need the spear, of course," said Serpentine. 
The wasp-waisted woman was now standing next to Richard, holding a small tray. 
On the tray was a small glass, containing an aggressively emerald-colored liquid. 
Richard stared at it, then looked at Door. 
"What are you giving him?" asked Door. 
"Nothing that will hurt him," said Serpentine, with a frosty smile. "You are 
guests." 
Richard knocked back the green liquid, which tasted of thyme and peppermint and 
winter mornings. He felt it go down and prepared himself to try to keep it from coming 
back up again. Instead he took a deep breath and realized, with a little surprise, that his 
head no longer hurt, and that he was starving. 
  
Old Bailey was not, intrinsically, one of those people put in the world to tell jokes. 
Despite this handicap, he persisted in trying. He loved to tell shaggy-dog stories of 
inordinate length, which would end in a sad pun although, often as not, Old Bailey 
would be unable to remember it by the time he got there. The only public for Old 
Bailey's jokes consisted of a small captive audience of birds, who, particularly the 
rooks, viewed his jokes as deep and philosophical parables containing profound and 
penetrating insights into what it meant to be human, and who would actually ask him, 
from time to time, to tell them another of his amusing stories. 
"All right, all right, all right," Old Bailey was saying. "Stop me if you've heard this 
one before. There was a man walked into a bar. No, he wasn't a man. That's the joke. 
Sorry. He was a horse. A horse . . . no . . . a piece of string. Three pieces of string. 
Right. Three pieces of string walk into a bar." 
A huge old rook croaked a question. Old Bailey rubbed his chin, then shrugged. 
"They just do. It's a joke. They can walk in the joke. He asks for a drink for himself and 
one for each of his friends. And the barman says, 'We don't serve pieces of string here.' 
To one of the pieces of string. So. It goes back to its friends and says, 'They don't serve 
strings here' And it's a joke, so the middle one does it too, three of them, you see, then 
the last one, he ties himself around the middle and he pulls the end of him all out. And 
he orders a drink." The rook croaked again, sagely. "Three drinks. Right. And the 

barman says, 'here, aren't you one of those pieces of string?' And he says, the piece of 
string, he says, 'No.'I'm a frayed knot.' Afraid not, y'see, a frayed knot. Pun. Very, very 
funny." 
The starlings made polite noises. The rooks nodded their heads, put their heads on 
one side. Then the oldest rook cawed at Old Bailey. "Another? I'm not made of hilarity, 
y'know. Let me think . . . " 
There was a noise from the tent, a deep, pulsing noise, like the beating of a distant 
heart. Old Bailey hurried into his tent. The noise was coming from an old wooden chest 
in which Old Bailey kept those things he most prized. He opened the chest. The 
throbbing noise became much louder. The small silver box was sitting on the top of Old 
Bailey's treasures. He reached down one gnarly hand and picked it up. A red light 
rhythmically pulsed and glowed inside it, like a heartbeat, and shone out through the 
silver filigree, and through the cracks and fastenings. "He's in trouble," said Old Bailey. 
The oldest rook cawed a question. "No. It's not a joke. It's the marquis," said Old 
Bailey. "He's in deep trouble." 
  
Richard was halfway through his second plate of breakfast when Serpentine 
pushed her chair back from the table. 
"I think I have had my fill of hospitality," she said. "Child, young man, good day. 
Hunter . . . " she paused. Then she ran one clawlike finger along the line of Hunter's 
jaw. "Hunter, you are always welcome here." She nodded to them, imperiously, and 
stood up and walked away, followed by her wasp-waisted butler. 
"We should leave now," said Hunter. She stood up from the table, and Door and 
Richard, more reluctantly, followed her. 
They walked along a corridor that was too thin to allow more than one of them to 
pass at a time. They went up some stone steps. They crossed an iron bridge in the 
darkness, while Underground trains echoed by beneath them. Then they entered what 
seemed like an endless network of underground vaults that smelled of damp and decay, 
of brick and stone and time. "That was your old boss, eh? She seemed nice enough," 
said Richard to Hunter. Hunter said nothing. 
Door, who had been somewhat subdued, said, "When they want to make children 
behave themselves in the Underside, they tell them, 'Behave, or Serpentine will take 
you.' " 
"Oh," said Richard. "And you worked for her, Hunter?" 
"I worked for all the Seven Sisters." 
"I thought that they hadn't spoken to each other for, oh, at least thirty years," said 
Door. 
"Quite possibly. But they were still talking then." 
"How old are you?" asked Door. Richard was pleased she had asked; he would 
never have dared. 
"As old as my tongue," said Hunter, primly, "and a little older than my teeth." 

"Anyway," said Richard, in the untroubled tone of voice of one whose hangover 
had left him and who knew that, somewhere far above them, someone was having a 
beautiful day, "that was okay. Nice food. And no one was trying to kill us." 
"I'm sure that will remedy itself as the day goes on," said Hunter, accurately. 
"Which way to the Black Friars, my lady?" 
Door paused and concentrated. "We'll go the river way," she said. "Over here." 
  
"Is he coming round yet?" asked Mr. Croup. 
Mr. Vandemar prodded the marquis's prone body with one long finger. The 
breathing was shallow. "Not yet, Mister Croup. I think I broke him." 
"You must be more careful with your toys, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup. 

ELEVEN 
"So what are you after?" Richard asked Hunter. The three of them were walking, with 
extreme care, along the bank of an underground river. The bank was slippery, a narrow 
path along dark rock and sharp masonry. Richard watched with respect as the gray 
water rushed and tumbled, within arm's reach. This was not the kind of river you fell 
into and got out of again; it was the other kind. 
"After?" 
"Well," he said. "Personally, I'm trying to get back to the real London, and my old 
life. Door wants to find out who killed her family. What are you after?" They edged 
along the bank, a step at a time, Hunter in the lead. She said nothing in reply. The river 
slowed and fed into a small underground lake. They walked beside the water, their 
lamps reflecting in the black surface, their reflections smudged by the river mist. "So 
what is it?" asked Richard. He did not expect any kind of answer. 
Hunter's voice was quiet and intense. She did not break her step as she spoke. "I 
fought in the sewers beneath New York with the great blind white alligator-king. He 
was thirty feet long, fat from sewage and fierce in battle. And I bested him, and I killed 
him. His eyes were like huge pearls in the darkness." Her strangely accented voice 
echoed in the underground, twined in the mist, in the night beneath the Earth. 
"I fought the bear that stalked the city beneath Berlin. He had killed a thousand 
men, and his claws were stained brown and black from the dried blood of a hundred 
years, but he fell to me. He whispered words in a human tongue as he died." The mist 
hung low on the lake. Richard fancied that he could see the creatures she spoke of, 
white shapes writhing in the vapor. 
"There was a black tiger in the undercity of Calcutta. A man-eater, brilliant and 
bitter, the size of a small elephant. A tiger is a worthy adversary. I took him with my 
bare hands." Richard glanced at Door. She was listening to Hunter intently: this was 
news to her too, then. "And I shall slay the Beast of London. They say his hide bristles 
with swords and spears and knives stuck in him by those who have tried and failed. His 
tusks are razors, and his hooves are thunderbolts. I will kill him, or I will die in the 
attempt." 
Her eyes shone as she spoke of her prey. The river mist had become a thick yellow 
fog. 
A bell was struck, a little way away, three times, the sound carrying across the 
water. The world began to lighten. Richard thought he could see the squat shapes of 
buildings around them. The yellow-green fog became thicker: it tasted of ash, and soot, 
and the grime of a thousand urban years. It clung to their lamps, muffling the light. 
"What is this?" he asked. 
"London fog," said Hunter. 
"But they stopped years ago, didn't they? Clean Air Act, smokeless fuels, all that?" 
Richard found himself remembering the Sherlock Holmes books of his childhood. 
"What did they call them again?" 

"Pea-soupers," said Door. "London Particulars. Thick yellow river fogs, mixed 
with coal-smoke and whatever rubbish was going into the air for the last five centuries. 
Hasn't been one in the Upworld for, oh, forty years now. We get the ghosts of them 
down here. Mm. Not ghosts. More like echoes." Richard breathed in a strand of the 
yellow-green fog and began to cough. "That doesn't sound good," said Door. 
"Fog in my throat," said Richard. The ground was becoming stickier, muddier: it 
sucked at Richard's feet as he walked. "Still," he said, to reassure himself, "a little fog 
never hurt anyone." 
Door looked up at him with big pixie eyes. "There was one in 1952 that they 
reckon killed four thousand people." 
"People from here?" he asked. "Under London?" 
"Your people," said Hunter. Richard was willing to believe it. He thought about 
holding his breath, but the fog was getting thicker. The ground was becoming mushier. 
"I don't understand," he asked. "Why do you have fogs down here, when we don't have 
them up there anymore?" 
Door scratched her nose. "There are little pockets of old time in London, where 
things and places stay the same, like bubbles in amber," she explained. "There's a lot of 
time in London, and it has to go somewhere—it doesn't all get used up at once." 
"I may still be hung over," sighed Richard. "That almost made sense." 
  
The abbot had known that this day would bring pilgrims. The knowledge was a 
part of his dreams; it surrounded him, like the darkness. So the day became one of 
waiting, which was, he knew, a sin: moments were to be experienced; waiting was a sin 
against both the time that was still to come and the moments one was currently 
disregarding. Still, he was waiting. Through each of the day's services, through their 
scant meals, the abbot was listening intently, waiting for the bell to sound, waiting to 
know who and how many. 
He found himself hoping for a clean death. The last pilgrim had lasted for almost a 
year, a gibbering, screaming thing. The abbot regarded his own blindness as neither a 
blessing nor a curse: it simply was; but even so, he had been grateful he had never been 
able to see the poor creature's face. Brother Jet, who had cared for the creature, still 
woke in the night, screaming, with its twisted face before him. 
The bell tolled late in the afternoon, three times. The abbot was in the shrine, on 
his knees, contemplating their charge. He pulled himself to his feet and made his way to 
the corridor, where he waited. "Father?" The voice was that of Brother Fuliginous. 
"Who guards the bridge?" the abbot asked him. His voice was surprisingly deep 
and melodious for such an old man. 
"Sable," came the reply from the darkness. The abbot reached out a hand, grasped 
the young man's elbow, and walked beside him, slowly, through the corridors of the 
abbey. 
  
There was no solid ground; there was no lake. Their feet were splashing through 
some kind of marsh, in the yellow fog. "This," announced Richard, "is disgusting." It 

was seeping through his shoes, invading his socks, and making a much closer 
acquaintance with his toes than Richard was entirely happy with. 
There was a bridge ahead of them, rising up out of the marsh. A figure, dressed in 
black, waited at the foot of the bridge. He wore the black robes of a Dominican monk. 
His skin was the dark brown of old mahogany. He was a tall man, and he held a 
wooden staff as tall as he was. "Hold fast," he called. "Tell me your names, and your 
stations." 
"I am the Lady Door," said Door. "I am Portico's daughter, of the House of the 
Arch." 
"I am Hunter. I am her bodyguard." 
"Richard Mayhew," said Richard. "Wet." 
"And you wish to pass?" 
Richard stepped forward. "Yes, we do actually. We're here for a key." The monk 
said nothing. He lifted his staff and pushed Richard gently in the chest with it. Richard's 
feet slid out from under him, and he landed in the muddy water. The monk waited a few 
moments, to see if Richard would swing up and begin to fight. Richard didn't. Hunter 
did. 
Richard pulled himself up from the mud, and watched, mouth open, as the monk 
and Hunter fought with quarter-staves. The monk was good. He was bigger than 
Hunter, and, Richard suspected, stronger. Hunter, on the other hand, was faster than the 
monk. The wooden staves clacked and whapped in the mist. 
The monk's staff made sudden contact with Hunter's midriff. She stumbled in the 
mud. He came in close—too close—as he discovered that her stumble had been a feint 
and her staff slammed into him, hard and precisely, on the backs of his knees, and his 
legs no longer held his weight. The man tumbled into the wet mud, and Hunter rested 
the tip of her staff on the back of his neck. 
"Enough," called a voice from the bridge. 
Hunter took a step back. She stood beside Richard and Door once more. She had 
not even broken a sweat. The big monk got up from the mud. His lip was bleeding. He 
bowed low to Hunter, then walked to the foot of the bridge. 
"Who are they, Brother Sable?" called the voice. 
"The Lady Door, Lord Portico's daughter, of the House of the Arch; Hunter, her 
bodyguard, and Richard Mayhew, their companion," said Brother Sable, through 
bruised lips. "She bested me in fair fight, Brother Fuliginous." 
"Let them come up," said the voice. 
Hunter led the way up the bridge. At the apex of the bridge, another monk was 
waiting for them: Brother Fuliginous. He was younger and smaller than the first monk 
they had met, but he was dressed the same way. His skin was a deep, rich brown. There 
were other black-clad figures, just barely visible, further into the yellow fog. These 
were the Black Friars, then, Richard realized. The second monk stared at the three of 
them for a second, and then recited: 

"I 
turn 
my 
head, 
and 
you 
may 
go 
where 
you 
want. 
I 
turn 
it 
again, 
you 
will 
stay 
till 
you 
rot. 
I have no face, but I live or die by my crooked teeth—who am I?" 
Door took a step forward. She licked her lips and half closed her eyes. "I turn my 
head . . . " she said, puzzling to herself. "Crooked teeth . . . go where you . . . " Then a 
smile spread over her face. She stared up at Brother Fuliginous. "A key," she said. "The 
answer is, you're a key." 
"A wise one," acknowledged Brother Fuliginous. "That's two steps taken. One 
more to take." 
A very old man stepped out of the yellow fog and walked cautiously toward them, 
his gnarled hand holding onto the stone side of the bridge. He stopped when he reached 
Brother Fuliginous. His eyes were a glaucous blue-white, thick with cataracts. Richard 
liked him on sight. "How many of them are there?" he asked the younger man, in a 
deep and reassuring voice. 
"Three, Father Abbot." 
"And has one of them bested the first gatekeeper?" 
"Yes, Father Abbot." 
"And did one of them answer the second gatekeeper correctly?" 
"Yes, Father Abbot." 
There was regret in the old man's voice. "So, one of them is left to face the Ordeal 
of the Key. Let him or her stand forward now." 
Door said, "Oh no." 
Hunter said, "Let me take his place. I will face the ordeal." 
Brother Fuliginous shook his head. "We cannot permit that." 
When Richard was a small boy he had been taken, as part of a school trip, to a 
local castle. With his class he had climbed the many steps to the highest point in the 
castle, a partly ruined tower. They had clustered together at the top, while the teacher 
pointed out to them the whole of the countryside, spread out below. Even at that age, 
Richard had not been very good at heights. He had clutched the safety rail, and closed 
his eyes, and tried not to look down. The teacher had told them that the drop from the 
top of the old tower to the bottom of the hill it overlooked was three hundred feet; then 
she told them that a penny, dropped from the top of the tower, would have enough force 
to penetrate the skull of a man at the bottom of the hill, that it would crack a skull like a 
bullet. That night Richard lay in bed, unable to sleep for imagining the penny falling 
with the power of a thunderbolt. Still looking like a penny, but such a murderous 
penny, when it dropped . . .  
An ordeal. 
The penny dropped for Richard. It was a thunderbolt sort of a penny. 
"Hang on a sec," he said. "Back up. Mm-mm: ordeal. Someone's got an ordeal 
waiting for them. Somebody who didn't have a little fight down in the mud, and didn't 
get to answer the riddle . . . " He was babbling. He could hear himself babbling, and he 
just didn't care. 

"This ordeal of yours," Richard asked the abbot. "How much of an ordeal is it?" 
"This way now," said the abbot. 
"You don't want him," said Door. "Take one of us." 
"Three of you come. There are three tests. Each of you faces one test: that is fair," 
said the abbot. "If he passes the ordeal, he will return to you." 
A light breeze eased the fog. The other dark figures were holding crossbows. Each 
crossbow was pointed at Richard, or Hunter, or Door. The friars closed ranks, cutting 
Richard off from Hunter and from Door. 
"We're looking for a key—" said Richard to the abbot, in a low voice. 
"Yes," said the abbot, placidly. 
"It's for an angel," explained Richard. 
"Yes," said the abbot. He reached out a hand, found the crook of Brother 
Fuliginous's arm. 
Richard lowered his voice. "Look, you can't say no to an angel, especially a man 
of the cloth like yourself . . . why don't we just skip the ordeal? You could just hand it 
over." 
The abbot began to walk down the curve of the bridge. There was a door, open at 
the bottom. Richard followed him. Sometimes there is nothing you can do. "When our 
order was founded," said the abbot, "we were entrusted with the key. It is one of the 
holiest, and the most powerful, of all sacred relics. We must pass it on, but only to the 
one who passes the ordeal and proves worthy." 
They walked through winding narrow corridors, Richard leaving a trail of wet mud 
behind him. "If I fail the ordeal, then we don't get the key, do we?" 
"No, my son." 
Richard thought about this for a moment. "Could I come back later for a second 
try?" 
Brother Fuliginous coughed. "Not really, my son," said the abbot. "If that should 
happen, you will in all probability be . . . " he paused, and then said, "beyond caring. 
But do not fret, perhaps you will be the one to win the key, eh?" There was a ghastly 
attempt at reassurance in his voice, more terrifying than any attempt to scare him could 
have been. 
"You would kill me?" 
The abbot stared ahead with blue-milk eyes. There was a touch of reproof in his 
voice. "We are holy men," he said. "No, it is the ordeal that kills you." 
They walked down a flight of steps, into a low, cryptlike room with oddly 
decorated walls. "Now," said the abbot. "Smile!" 
There was the electric fizz of a camera flash going off, blinding Richard for a 
moment. When he could see again, Brother Fuliginous was lowering a battered old 
Polaroid camera and was yanking out the photograph. The friar waited until it had 
developed, and then he pinned it to the wall. "This is our wall of those who failed," 
sighed the abbot, "to ensure that they are none of them forgotten. That is our burden 
also: memorial." 

Richard stared at the faces. A few Polaroids; twenty or thirty other photographic 
snapshots, some sepia prints and daguerreotypes; and, after that, pencil sketches, and 
watercolors, and miniatures. They went all the way along one wall. The friars had been 
at this a very long time. 
  
Door shivered. "I'm so stupid," she muttered. "I should have known. Three of us. I 
should never have come straight here." 
Hunter's head was moving from side to side. She had noted the position of each of 
the friars and each of the crossbows; she had calculated the odds of getting Door over 
the side of the bridge first unharmed, then with only minor injuries, and lastly with 
major injury to herself, but only minor injury to Door. She was now recalculating. "And 
what would you have done differently if you had known?" she asked. 
"I wouldn't have brought him here, for a start," said Door. "I'd have found the 
marquis." 
Hunter put her head on one side. "You trust him?" she asked, directly, and Door 
knew she was talking of de Carabas, not Richard. 
"Yes," said Door. "I more or less trust him." 
Door had been five years old for just two days. The market was being held in the 
Gardens at Kew on that day, and her father had taken her with him, as a birthday treat. 
It was her first market. They were in the butterfly house, surrounded by brightly 
colored wings, iridescent weightless things that entranced and fascinated her, when her 
father crouched down beside her. "Door?" he said. "Turn around slowly, and look over 
there." 
She turned, and looked. A dark-skinned man wearing a big coat, his black hair 
tied behind him in a long pony tail, was standing by the door, talking to two golden-
skinned twins, a young man and a young woman. The young woman was crying, in the 
way that grown-ups cry, keeping it inside as much as they can, and hating it when it 
still pushes out at the edges, making them ugly and funny-looking on the way. Door 
turned back to the butterflies. "You saw him?" asked her father. She nodded. "He calls 
himself the marquis de Carabas," he said. "He's a fraud and a cheat and possibly even 
something of a monster. If you're ever in trouble, go to him. He will protect you, girl. 
He has to." 
Door looked back at the man. He had a hand on the shoulder of each of the twins 
and was leading them from the room; but he glanced back over his shoulder, as he left, 
and he looked straight at her, and smiled an enormous smile; and then he winked at 
her. 
The friars who surrounded them were dark ghosts in the fog. Door raised her 
voice. "Excuse me, brother," she called to Brother Sable. "But our friend, who's gone to 
get the key. If he fails, what happens to us?" 
He took a step toward them, hesitated, and then said, "We escort you away from 
here, and we let you go." 
"What about Richard?" she asked. Beneath his cowl, she could see him shaking his 
head, sadly, finally. "I should have brought the marquis," said Door; and she wondered 
where he was, and what he was doing. 

  
The marquis de Carabas was being crucified on a large X-shaped wooden 
construction Mr. Vandemar had knocked together from several old pallets, part of a 
chair and a wooden gate. He had also used most of a large box of rusting nails. 
It had been a very long time since they had crucified anybody. 
The marquis de Carabas's arms and legs, were spread into a wide X shape. Rusty 
nails went into his hands and feet. He was also roped around the waist. After 
experiencing terrible pain, he was now, more or less, unconscious. The whole 
construction dangled in the air, from several ropes, in a room that had once been the 
hospital staff cafeteria. On the ground below, Mr. Croup had assembled a large mound 
of sharp objects, ranging from razors and kitchen knives to abandoned scalpels and 
lancets. There was even a poker, from the furnace room. 
"Why don't you see how he's doing, Mister Vandemar?" asked Mr. Croup. 
Mr. Vandemar reached out his hammer, and prodded the marquis experimentally 
with it. 
The marquis de Carabas was not a good man, and he knew himself well enough to 
be perfectly certain that he was not a brave man. He had long since decided that the 
world, Above or Below, was a place that wished to be deceived, and, to this end, he had 
named himself from a lie in a fairy tale, and created himself—his clothes, his manner, 
his carriage—as a grand joke. 
There was a dull pain at his wrists and his feet, and he was finding it harder and 
harder to breathe. There was nothing more to be gained by feigning unconsciousness, 
and he raised his head, as best he could, and spat a gob of scarlet blood into Mr. 
Valdemar's face. 
It was a brave thing to do, he thought. And a stupid one. Perhaps they would have 
let him die quietly, if he had not done that. Now, he had no doubt, they would hurt him 
more. 
And perhaps his death would come the quicker for it. 
  
The open kettle was boiling fiercely. Richard watched the bubbling water, and the 
thick steam, and wondered what they were going to do with it. His imagination was 
able to provide any number of answers, most of which would have been unimaginably 
painful, none of which turned out to be correct. 
The boiling water was poured into a pot, to which Brother Fuliginous added three 
spoons of dried, shredded leaves. The resultant liquid was poured from the pot through 
a tea strainer, into three china cups. The abbot raised his blind head, sniffed the air, and 
smiled. "The first part of the Ordeal of the Key," he said, "is the nice cup of tea. Do you 
take sugar?" 
"No, thank you," said Richard, warily. 
Brother Fuliginous added a little milk to the tea, and passed a cup and saucer to 
Richard. "Is it poisoned?" he asked. 
The abbot looked almost offended: "Good gracious, no." 

Richard sipped the tea, which tasted more or less exactly like tea always tasted. 
"But this is part of the ordeal?" 
Brother Fuliginous took the abbot's hands and placed a cup of tea in them. "In a 
manner of speaking," said the abbot. "We always like to give the seekers a cup of tea 
before they start. Part of the ordeal for us. Not for you." He sipped his own tea, and a 
beatific smile spread across his ancient face. "Rather nice tea, all things considered." 
Richard put down his teacup, almost untouched. "Would you mind," he asked, "if 
we just began the ordeal?" 
"Not at all," said the abbot. "Not at all." He stood up, and the three of them walked 
toward a door, at the far end of the room. 
"Is there . . . " Richard paused, trying to decide what he was trying to ask. Then he 
said, "Is there anything you can tell me about the ordeal?" 
The abbot shook his head. There really was nothing to say: he led the seekers to 
the door. And then he would wait, for an hour, or two, in the corridor outside. Then he 
would go back in, and remove the remains of the seeker from the shrine, and inter it in 
the vaults. And sometimes, which was worse, they would not be dead, although you 
could not call what was left of them alive, and those unfortunates the Black Friars cared 
for as best they could. 
"Right," said Richard. And he smiled, unconvincingly, and added, "Well, lead on, 
Macduff." 
Brother Fuliginous pulled back the bolts on the door. They opened with a crash, 
like twin gunshots. He pulled the door open. Richard stepped through it. Brother 
Fuliginous pushed the door closed behind him, and swung the bolts back into place. He 
led the abbot back to his chair and placed the cup of tea back in the old man's hand. The 
abbot sipped his tea, in silence. And then he said, with honest regret in his voice, "It's 
'lay on, Macduff' actually. But I hadn't the heart to correct him. He sounded like such a 
nice young man." 

TWELVE 
Richard Mayhew walked down the underground platform. It was a District Line station: 
the sign said BLACKFRIARS. The platform was empty. Somewhere in the distance an 
Underground train roared and rattled, driving a ghost-wind along the platform, which 
scattered a copy of the tabloid Sun into its component pages, four-color breasts and 
black-and-white invective scurrying and tumbling off the platform and down onto the 
rails. 
Richard walked the length of the platform. Then he sat down on a bench and 
waited for something to happen. 
Nothing happened. 
He rubbed his head and felt slightly sick. There were footsteps on the platform, 
near him, and he looked up to see a prim little girl walking past him, hand in hand with 
a woman who looked like a larger, older version of the girl. They glanced at him and 
then, rather obviously, looked away. "Don't get too near to him, Melanie," advised the 
woman, in a very audible whisper. 
Melanie looked at Richard, staring in the way children stare, without 
embarrassment or self consciousness. Then she looked back at her mother. "Why do 
people like that stay alive?" she asked, curiously. 
"Not enough guts to end it all," explained her mother. 
Melanie risked another glance at Richard. "Pathetic," she said. Their feet pattered 
away down the platform, and soon they were gone. He wondered if he had imagined it. 
He tried to remember why he was standing on this platform. Was he waiting for a Tube 
train? Where was he going? He knew the answer was somewhere in his head, 
somewhere close at hand, but he could not touch it, could not bring it back from the lost 
places. He sat there, alone and wondering. Was he dreaming? With his hands he felt the 
hard red plastic seat beneath him, stamped the platform with mud-encrusted shoes 
(where had the mud come from?), touched his face . . . No. This was no dream. 
Wherever he was, was real. He felt odd: detached, and depressed, and horribly, 
strangely saddened. Someone sat down next to him. Richard did not look up, did not 
turn his head. 
"Hello," said a familiar voice. "How are you, Dick? You all right?" 
Richard looked up. He felt his face creasing into a smile, hope hitting him like a 
blow to the chest. 
"Gary?" he asked, scared. Then, "You can see me?" 
Gary grinned. "You always were a kidder," he said. "Funny man, funny." 
Gary was wearing a suit and tie. He was cleanshaven, and had not a hair out of 
place. Richard realized what he must look like: muddy, unshaven, rumpled . . . "Gary? I 
. . . listen, I know what I must look like. I can explain." He thought for a moment. "No 
. . . I can't. Not really." 
"It's okay," said Gary reassuringly. His voice was soothing, sane. "Not sure how to 
tell you this. Bit awkward." He paused. "Look," he explained. "I'm not really here." 

"Yes, you are," said Richard. Gary shook his head, sympathetically. "No," he said. 
"I'm not. I'm you. Talking to yourself." 
Richard wondered vaguely if this was one of Gary's jokes. "Maybe this will help," 
said Gary. He raised his hands to his face, pushed at it, molded, shaped. His face oozed 
like warm Silly Putty. 
"Is that better?" said the person who had been Gary, in a voice that was jarringly 
familiar. Richard knew the new face: he had shaved it most weekday mornings since he 
had left school; he had brushed its teeth, combed its hair, and, on occasion, wished it 
looked more like Tom Cruise's, or John Lennon's, or anyone else's, really. It was, of 
course, his face. "You're sitting on Blackfriars Station at rush hour," said the other 
Richard, casually. "You're talking to yourself. And you know what they say about 
people who talk to themselves. It's just that you're starting to edge a little closer to 
sanity, now." 
The damp, muddy Richard stared into the face of the clean, well-dressed Richard, 
and he said, "I don't know who you are or what you're trying to do. But you aren't even 
very convincing: you don't really look like me." He was lying, and he knew it. 
His other self smiled encouragingly, and shook his head. "I'm you, Richard," he 
said. "I'm whatever's left of your sanity . . . " 
It was not the embarrassing echo of his voice he heard on answering machines, on 
tapes and home videos, that horrid parody of a voice that passed for his: the man spoke 
with Richard's true voice, the voice he heard in his head when he spoke, resonant and 
real. 
"Concentrate!" shouted the man with Richard's face. "Look at this place, try to see 
the people, try to see the truth . . . you're already the closest to reality that you've been 
in a week . . . " 
"This is bullshit," said Richard, flatly, desperately. He shook his head, denying 
everything his other self was saying, but, still, he looked at the platform, wondering 
what it was he was meant to be seeing. Then something flickered, at the corner of his 
vision; he followed it with his head, but it was gone. 
"Look," whispered his double. "See." 
"See what?" He was standing on an empty, dimly lit station platform, a lonely 
mausoleum of a place. And then . . .  
The noise and the light struck him like a bottle across the face: he was standing on 
Blackfriars Station, in the middle of the rush hour. People bustled by him: a riot of 
noise and light, of shoving, moving humanity. There was an Underground train waiting 
at the platform, and, reflected in its window, Richard could see himself. He looked 
crazy; he had a week's growth of beard; food was crusted around his mouth; one eye 
had recently been blackened, and a boil, an angry red carbuncle, was coming up on the 
side of his nose; he was filthy, covered in a black, encrusted dirt which filled his pores 
and lived under his fingernails; his eyes were red and bleary, his hair was matted and 
snarled. He was a crazy homeless person, standing on a platform of a busy 
Underground station, in the heart of the rush hour. Richard buried his face deep in his 
hands. When he raised his face, the other people were gone. The platform was dark 
again, and he was alone. He sat down on a bench and closed his eyes. A hand found his 

hand, held it for some moments, and then squeezed it. A woman's hand: he could smell 
a familiar perfume. 
The other Richard sat on his left, and now Jessica sat on his right, holding his hand 
in hers, looking at him compassionately. He had never seen that expression on her face 
before. 
"Jess?" he said. 
Jessica shook her head. She let go of his hand. "I'm afraid not," she said. "I'm still 
you. But you have to listen, darling. You're the closest to reality you've been—" 
"You people keep saying, the closest to reality, the closest to sanity, I don't know 
what you . . . " He paused. Something came back to him, then. He looked at the other 
version of himself, at the woman he had loved. "Is this part of the ordeal?" he 
demanded. 
"Ordeal?" asked Jessica. She exchanged a concerned glance with the-other-
Richard-who-wasn't-him. 
"Yes. Ordeal. With the Black Friars who live under London," Richard said. As he 
said it, it became more real, "There's a key I have to get for this angel called Islington. 
If I get him the key, he'll send me home again . . . " His mouth dried up, and he could 
talk no longer. 
"Listen to yourself," said the other Richard, gently. "Can't you tell how ridiculous 
all this sounds?" Jessica looked as if she were trying not to cry. Her eyes glistened. 
"You're not going through an ordeal, Richard. You—you had some kind of nervous 
breakdown. A couple of weeks ago. I think you just cracked up. I broke off our 
engagement—you'd been acting so strangely, it was like you were a different person, 
I—I couldn't cope . . . Then you vanished . . . " The tears began to run down her cheeks, 
and she stopped talking to blow her nose on a tissue. 
The other Richard began to speak. "I wandered, alone and crazy, through the 
streets of London, sleeping under bridges, eating food from garbage cans. Shivering 
and lost and alone. Muttering to myself, talking to people who weren't there . . . " 
"I'm so sorry, Richard," said Jessica. She was crying, now, her face contorted and 
unattractive. Her mascara was beginning to run, and her nose was red. He had never 
seen her hurting before, and he realized how much he wanted to take her pain away. 
Richard reached out for her, to try to hold her, to comfort and reassure her, but the 
world slid and twisted and changed . . .  
Someone stumbled into him, cursed and walked away. Richard was lying prone on 
the platform, in the rush-hour glare. The side of his face was sticky and cold. He pulled 
his head up off the ground. He had been lying in a pool of his own vomit. At least, he 
hoped it was his own. Passersby stared at him with revulsion, or, after one flick of the 
eyes, did not look at him again. 
He wiped at his face with his hands and tried to get up, but he could no longer 
remember how. Richard began to whimper. He shut his eyes tightly, and he kept them 
shut. When he opened them, thirty seconds, or an hour, or a day later, the platform was 
in semidarkness. He climbed to his feet. There was nobody there. "Hello?" he called. 
"Help me. Please." 

Gary was sitting on the bench, watching him. "What, you still need someone to tell 
you what to do?" Gary got up and walked over to where Richard was standing. 
"Richard," he said, urgently. "I'm you. The only advice I can give you is what you're 
telling yourself. Only, maybe you're too scared to listen." 
"You aren't me," said Richard, but he no longer believed it. 
"Touch me," said Gary. 
Richard reached a hand out: his hand pushed into Gary's face, squashing and 
distorting it, as if it were pushing into warm bubble gum. Richard felt nothing in the air 
around his hand. He pulled his fingers out of Gary's face. 
"See?" said Gary. "I'm not here. All there is, is you, walking up and down the 
platform, talking to yourself, trying to get up the courage to . . . " 
Richard had not meant to say anything; but his mouth moved and he heard his 
voice saying, "Trying to get up the courage to do what?" 
A deep voice came over the loudspeaker, and echoed, distorted, down the 
platform. "London Transport would like to apologize for the delay. This is due to an 
incident at Blackfriars Station." "To do that," said Gary, inclining his head. "Become 
an incident at Blackfriars Station. To end it all. Your life's a joyless, loveless, empty 
sham. You've got no friends—" 
"I've got you," whispered Richard. Gary appraised Richard with frank eyes. 
"I think you're an asshole," he said, honestly. "A complete joke." 
"I've got Door, and Hunter, and Anaesthesia." 
Gary smiled. There was real pity in the smile, and it hurt Richard more than hatred 
or enmity could ever have done. "More imaginary 'friends? We all used to laugh at you 
round the office for those trolls. Remember them? On your desk." He laughed. Richard 
started to laugh, too. It was all too horrible: there was nothing else to do but laugh. 
After some time he stopped laughing. Gary put his hand into his pocket and produced a 
small plastic troll. It had frizzy purple hair, and it had once sat on the top of Richard's 
computer screen. "Here," said Gary. He tossed the troll to Richard. Richard tried to 
catch it; he reached out his hands, but it fell through them as if they were not there. He 
went down onto his hands and knees on the empty platform, fumbling for the troll. It 
seemed to him, then, as if it were the only fragment he had of his real life: that if he 
could only get the troll back, perhaps he could get everything back . . .  
Flash. 
It was rush hour again. A train disgorged hundreds of people onto the platform, 
and hundreds of others tried to get on, and Richard was down on his hands and knees, 
being kicked and buffeted by the commuters. Somebody stepped on his fingers, hard. 
He screamed shrilly, and stuck his fingers into his mouth, instinctively, like a burned 
child; they tasted disgusting. He did not care: he could see the troll at the platform's 
edge, now only ten feet away, and he crawled, slowly, on all fours, through the crowd, 
across the platform. People swore at him; they got in his way; they buffeted him. He 
had never imagined that ten feet could be such a long distance to travel. 
Richard heard a high-pitched voice giggling, as he crawled, and he wondered who 
it could belong to. It was a disturbing giggle, nasty and strange. He wondered what 

manner of crazy person could giggle like that. He swallowed, and the giggling stopped, 
and then he knew. 
He was almost at the edge of the platform. An elderly woman stepped onto the 
train, and as she did so, her foot knocked the purple-haired troll down into the darkness, 
down into the gap between the train and the platform. "No," said Richard. He was still 
laughing, an awkward, wheezing laugh, but tears stung his eyes and spilled down his 
cheeks. He rubbed his eyes with his hands, making them sting even more. 
Flash. 
The platform was deserted and dark again. He climbed to his feet and walked, 
unsteadily, the last few feet, to the edge of the platform. He could see it there, down on 
the tracks, by the third rail: a small splash of purple, his troll. He looked ahead of him: 
there were enormous posters stuck to the wall on the other side of the tracks. The 
posters advertised credit cards and sports shoes and holidays in Cyprus. As he looked 
the words on the posters twisted and mutated. 
New messages: 
END IT ALL was one of them. 
PUT YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR MISERY. 
BE A MAN—DO YOURSELF IN. 
HAVE A FATAL ACCIDENT TODAY. 
He nodded. He was talking to himself. The posters did not really say that. Yes, he 
was talking to himself; and it was time that he listened. He could hear the rattling of a 
train, not far away, coming toward the station. Richard clenched his teeth, and swayed 
back and forth, as if he were still being buffeted by commuters, although he was alone 
on the platform. 
The train was coming toward him; its headlights shining out from the tunnel like 
the eyes of a monstrous dragon in a childhood nightmare. And he understood then just 
how little effort it would take to make the pain stop—to take all the pain he ever had 
had, all the pain he ever would have, and make it all go away for ever and ever. He 
pushed his hands deep into his pockets, and took a deep breath. It would be so easy. A 
moment of pain, and then it would all be over and done . . .  
There was something in his pocket. He felt it with his fingers: something smooth 
and hard and roughly spherical. He pulled it out of his pocket, and examined it: a quartz 
bead. He remembered picking it up, then. He had been on the far side of Night's Bridge. 
The bead had been part of Anaesthesia's necklace. 
And from somewhere, in his head or out of it, he thought he heard the rat-girl say, 
"Richard. Hold on." He did not know if there was anyone helping him at that moment. 
He suspected that he was, truly, talking to himself. That this was the real him speaking, 
and he was, finally, listening. 
He nodded and put the bead back into his pocket. And he stood on the platform 
and waited for the train to come in. It arrived at the platform, slowed, came to a full 
stop. 
The train doors hissed open. The carriage was filled with every manner and kind 
of people, all of whom were, unmistakably, quite dead. There were fresh corpses, with 
ragged cuts in their throats or bullet holes in their temples. There were old, desiccated 

bodies. There were strap-hanging cadavers, covered with cobwebs, and cancerous 
things lolling in their seats. Each corpse seemed, as much as one could tell, to have died 
by its own hand. Some were male, and some were female. Richard thought he had seen 
some of those faces, pinned to a long wall; but he could no longer remember where he 
had seen them, could not remember when. The carriage smelled like a morgue might at 
the end of a long, hot summer during the course of which the refrigeration equipment 
had failed for good. 
Richard had no idea who he was, anymore; no idea what was or what was not true; 
nor whether he was brave or cowardly, mad or sane, but he knew the next thing he had 
to do. He stepped onto the train, and all the lights went out. 
  
The bolts were drawn back. Two loud bangs echoed through the room. The door to 
the tiny shrine was pushed open, letting in lamplight from the hall outside. 
It was a small room with a high arched ceiling. A silver key hung from a thread, 
attached to the highest point of the ceiling. The wind caused by the opening of the door 
made the key swing back and forth, and then spin slowly, first one way, and then the 
other. The abbot held Brother Fuliginous's arm, and the two men walked into the 
shrine, side by side. Then the abbot let go of the brother's arm, and said, "Take the 
body, Brother Fuliginous." 
"But. But Father . . . " 
"What is it?" 
Brother Fuliginous went down on one knee. The abbot could hear fingers against 
cloth and skin. "He's not dead." 
The abbot sighed. It was an evil thing to think, he knew, but he honestly felt it was 
so much kinder if they died outright. This was so much worse. "One of those, eh?" he 
said. "Ah well, we will look after the poor creature until it passes on to its ultimate 
reward. Lead it to the infirmary." 
And a weak voice said, quietly, but firmly, "I am not a poor creature." The abbot 
heard someone stand up; heard Brother Fuliginous's sharp intake of breath. "I . . . I 
think I got through it," said Richard Mayhew's voice, suddenly uncertain. "Unless this 
is more of the ordeal." 
"No, my son," said the abbot. There was something in his voice that might have 
been awe, and might have been regret. 
There was silence. "I . . . I think I will have that cup of tea now, if you don't 
mind," said Richard. 
"Of course," said the abbot. "This way." Richard stared at the old man. The 
glaucous eyes gazed out at nothing at all. He seemed pleased that Richard was alive, 
but . . .  
"Excuse me?" said Brother Fuliginous, respectfully, to Richard, breaking his train 
of thought. "Don't forget your key." 
"Oh. Yes. Thanks." He had forgotten about the key. He reached out and closed his 
hand upon the cold silver key, rotating slowly on its thread. He tugged, and the thread 
snapped easily. 

Richard opened his hand, and the key stared up at him from his palm. "By my 
crooked teeth," asked Richard, remembering, "who am I?" 
He put it into his pocket, next to the small quartz bead, and together they left that 
place. 
  
The fog had begun to thin. Hunter was pleased. She was confident now that, 
should it become necessary, she could get the Lady Door away from the friars entirely 
unharmed and get herself away with only minor flesh wounds. 
There was a flurry of movement on the far side of the bridge. "Something's 
happening," said Hunter to Door, under her breath. "Get ready to make a run for it." 
The friars drew back. Richard Mayhew, the Upworlder, came toward them 
through the fog, walking beside the abbot. Richard looked different, somehow . . . 
Hunter scrutinized him, trying to work out what had changed. His center of balance had 
moved lower, become more centered. No . . . it was more than that. He looked less 
boyish. He looked as if he had begun to grow up. 
"Still alive then?" said Hunter. He nodded; put his hand into his pocket, and pulled 
out a silver key. He tossed it to Door, who caught it, then flung herself at him, wrapping 
her arms around him, squeezing him as tightly as she could. 
Then Door let go of Richard and ran to the abbot. "I can't tell you how much this 
means to us," she said to him. 
He smiled, weakly but graciously. "May the Temple and the Arch be with you all, 
on your journey through the Underside," he said. 
Door curtseyed, and then, clutching the key tightly in her hand, she went back to 
Richard, and to Hunter. The three travelers walked down the bridge, and away. The 
friars stood on the bridge until they were out of sight, lost in the old fog of the world 
beneath the world. 
"We have lost the key," said the abbot to himself, as much as to any of them. "God 
help us all." 

THIRTEEN 
The Angel Islington was dreaming A dark and rushing dream. 
Huge waves were rising and crashing over the city; the night sky was rent with 
forks of white lightning from horizon to horizon; the rain fell in sheets, the city 
trembled; fires started near the great amphitheater and spread, quickly, through the city, 
defying the storm. Islington was looking down on everything from far above, hovering 
in the air, as one hovers in dreams, as it had hovered in those long-ago times. There 
were buildings in that city that were many hundreds of feet high, but they were dwarfed 
by the gray-green Atlantic waves. And then it heard the people scream. There were four 
million people in Atlantis, and, in its dream, Islington heard each and every one of their 
voices, clearly and distinctly, as, one by one, they screamed, and choked, and burned, 
and drowned, and died. The waves swallowed the city, and, at length, the storm 
subsided. 
When dawn broke, there was nothing to indicate there had ever been a city there at 
all, let alone an island twice the size of Greece. Nothing of Atlantis remained but the 
water-bloated bodies of children, of women and of men, floating on the cold morning 
waves; bodies the seagulls, gray and white, were already beginning to pick with their 
cruel beaks. 
And Islington woke. It was standing in the octagon of iron pillars, beside the great 
black door, made of flint and tarnished silver. It touched the cold smoothness of the 
flint, the chill of the metal. It touched the table. It ran its finger lightly along the walls. 
Then it walked through chambers of its hall, one after another, touching things, as if to 
reassure itself of their existence, to convince itself it was here, and now. It followed 
patterns, as it walked, smooth channels its bare feet had worn, over the centuries, in the 
rock. It stopped when it reached the rock-pool, kneeling down and letting its fingers 
touch the cold water. 
There was a ripple in the water, which began with its fingertips and echoed out to 
the edges. The reflections in the pool, of the angel itself and the candle flames that 
framed it, shimmered and transformed. It was looking into a cellar. The angel 
concentrated for a moment; it could hear a telephone ring, somewhere in the distance. 
Mr. Croup walked over to the telephone and picked up the receiver. He looked 
rather pleased with himself. "Croup and Vandemar," he barked. "Eyes gouged, noses 
twisted, tongues pierced, chins cleft, throats slit." 
"Mister Croup," said the angel. "They now have the key. I want the girl called 
Door kept safe on her journey back to me." 
"Safe," repeated Mr. Croup, unimpressed. "Right. We'll keep her safe. What a 
marvelous idea—such originality. Positively astounding. Most people would be content 
with hiring assassins for executions, sly killings, vile murders even. Only you, sir, 
would hire the two finest cutthroats in the whole of space and time, and then ask them 
to ensure a little girl remains unharmed." 
"See that she is, Mister Croup. Nothing is to hurt her. Permit her to be harmed in 
any way and you will displease me deeply. Do you understand?" 

"Yes." Croup shifted uncomfortably. 
"Is there anything else?" asked Islington. 
"Yes, sir." Croup coughed into his hand. "Do you remember the marquis de 
Carabas?" 
"Of course." 
"I take it that there is no such similar prohibition on extirpating the marquis . . . ?" 
"Not any longer," said the angel. "Just protect the girl." 
It removed its hand from the water. The reflection was now merely candle flames 
and an angel of astonishing, perfectly androgynous, beauty. The Angel Islington stood 
up and returned to its inner chambers to await its eventual visitors. 
  
"What did he say?" asked Mr. Vandemar. 
"He said, Mister Vandemar, that we should feel free to do whatsoever we wished 
to the marquis." 
Vandemar nodded. "Did that include killing him painfully?" he asked, a little 
pedantically. 
"Yes, Mister Vandemar, I would say, on reflection, it did." 
"That's good, Mister Croup. Wouldn't like another telling-off." He looked up at the 
bloody thing hanging above them. "Better get rid of the body, then." 
  
One of the front wheels on the supermarket shopping cart squeaked, and it had a 
pronounced tendency to pull to the left. Mr. Vandemar had found the metal cart on a 
grassed-in traffic island, near the hospital. It was, he had realized on seeing it, just the 
right size for moving a body. He could have carried the body, of course; but then it 
could have bled on him, or dripped other fluids. And he only had the one suit. So he 
pushed the shopping cart with the body of the marquis de Carabas in it through the 
storm drain, and the cart went squee, squee and pulled to the left. He wished that Mr. 
Croup would push the shopping cart, for a change. But Mr. Croup was talking. "You 
know, Mister Vandemar," he was saying, "I am currently too overjoyed, too delighted, 
not to mention too utterly and illimitably ecstatic, to grouse, gripe or grumble—having 
finally been permitted to do what we do best—'" 
Mr. Vandemar negotiated a particularly awkward corner. "Kill someone, you 
mean?" he asked. 
Mr. Croup beamed. "Kill someone I mean indeed, Mister Vandemar, brave soul, 
glittering, noble fellow. However, by now you must have sensed a lurking 'but' skulking 
beneath my happy, blithe, and chipper exterior. A minuscule vexation, like the teeniest 
lump of raw liver sticking to the inside of my boot. You must, I have no doubt, be 
saying to yourself, 'All is not well in Mister Croup's breast. I shall induce him to 
unburden himself to me.' " 
Mr. Vandemar pondered this while he forced open the round iron door between 
the storm drain and the sewer and clambered through. Then he manhandled the wire 
cart with the marquis de Carabas's body through the doorway. And then, more or less 
certain that he had been thinking nothing of the sort, he said, "No." 

Mr. Croup ignored this, and continued, " . . . And, were I then, in response to your 
pleadings, to divulge to you what vexes me, I would confess that my soul is irked by 
the necessity to hide our light under a bushel. We should be hanging the former 
marquis's sad remains from the highest gibbet in London Below. Not tossing it away, 
like a used . . . " He paused, searching for the exact simile. 
"Rat?" suggested Mr. Vandemar. "Thumbscrew? Spleen?" Squee, squee went the 
wheels of the shopping cart. 
"Ah well," said Mr. Croup. In front of them was a deep channel of brown water. 
Drifting on the water's surface were off-white suds of foam, used condoms, and 
occasional fragments of toilet paper. Mr. Vandemar stopped the shopping cart. Mr. 
Croup leaned down and picked up the marquis's head by the hair, hissing into its dead 
ear, "The sooner this business is over and done with, the happier I'll be. There's other 
times and other places that would properly appreciate two pair of dab hands with the 
garrotting wire and the boning knife." 
Then he stood up. "Goodnight, good marquis. Don't forget to write." 
Mr. Vandemar tipped over the cart, and the marquis's corpse tumbled out and 
splashed into the brown water below them. And then, because he had come to dislike it 
intensely, Mr. Vandemar pushed the shopping cart into the sewer as well, and watched 
the current carry it away. 
Then Mr. Croup held his lamp up high, and he stared out at the place in which they 
stood. "It is saddening to reflect," said Mr. Croup, "that there are folk walking the 
streets above who will never know the beauty of these sewers, Mister Vandemar. These 
red-brick cathedrals beneath their feet." 
"Craftsmanship," agreed Mr. Vandemar. 
They turned their backs on the brown water and made their way back into the 
tunnels. "With cities, as with people, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup, fastidiously, 
"the condition of the bowels is all-important." 
  
Door tied the key around her neck with a piece of string that she found in one of 
the pockets of her leather jacket. "That's not going to be safe," said Richard. The girl 
made a face at him. "Well," he said. "It's not." 
She shrugged. "Okay," she said. "I'll get a chain for it when we get to the market." 
They were walking through a maze of caves, deep tunnels hacked from the limestone 
that seemed almost prehistoric. 
Richard chuckled. "What's so funny?" Door asked. 
He grinned. "I was just thinking of the expression on the marquis's face when we 
tell him we got the key from the friars without his help." 
"I'm sure he'll have something sardonic to say about it," she said. "And then, back 
to the angel. By the 'long and dangerous way.' Whatever that is." 
Richard admired the paintings on the cave walls. Russets and ochres and siennas 
outlined charging boars and fleeing gazelles, woolly mastodons and giant sloths: he 
imagined that the paintings had to be thousands of years old, but then they turned a 
corner, and he noticed that, in the same style, there were lorries, house cats, cars, and—

markedly inferior to the other images, as if only glimpsed infrequently, and from a long 
way away—airplanes. 
None of the paintings were very high off the ground. He wondered if the painters 
were a race of subterranean Neanderthal pygmies. It was as likely as anything else in 
this strange world. "So where is the next market?" he asked. 
"No idea," said Door. "Hunter?" 
Hunter slipped out of the shadows. "I don't know." 
A small figure dashed past them, going back the way they had come. A few 
moments later another couple of tiny figures came toward them in fell pursuit. Hunter 
whipped out a hand as they passed, snagging a small boy by the ear. "Ow," he said, in 
the manner of small boys. "Let me go! She stole my paintbrush." 
"That's right," said a piping voice from further down the corridor. "She did." 
"I didn't," came an even higher and more piping voice, from even further down the 
corridor. 
Hunter pointed to the paintings on the cave wall. "You did these?" she asked. 
The boy had the towering arrogance only seen in the greatest of artists and all 
nine-year-old boys. "Yeah," he said, truculently. "Some of them." 
"Not bad," said Hunter. The boy glared at her. 
"Where's the next Floating Market?" asked Door. 
"Belfast," said the boy. "Tonight." 
"Thanks," said Door. "Hope you get your paintbrush back. Let him go, Hunter." 
Hunter let go of the boy's ear. He did not move. He looked her up and down, then 
made a face, to indicate that he was, without any question at all, unimpressed. "You're 
Hunter?" he asked. She smiled down at him, modestly. He sniffed. "You're the best 
bodyguard in the Underside?" 
"So they tell me." 
The boy reached one hand back and forward again, in one smooth movement. He 
stopped, puzzled, and opened his hand, examined his palm. Then he looked up at 
Hunter, confused. Hunter opened her hand to reveal a small switchblade with a wicked 
edge. She held it up, out of the boy's reach. He wrinkled his nose. "How'd you do that?" 
"Scram," said Hunter. She closed the knife and tossed it back to the boy, who took 
off down the corridor without a backward glance, in pursuit of his paintbrush. 
  
The body of the marquis de Carabas drifted east, through the deep sewer, face 
down. 
London's sewers had begun their lives as rivers and streams, flowing north to 
south (and, south of the Thames, south to north) carrying garbage, animal carcasses, 
and the contents of chamber pots into the Thames, which would, for the most part, 
carry the offending substances out to sea. This system had more or less worked for 
many years, until, in 1858, the enormous volume of effluent produced by the people 
and industries of London, combined with a rather hot summer, produced a phenomenon 
known at the time as the Great Stink: the Thames itself had become an open sewer. 

People who could leave London, left it; the ones who stayed wrapped cloths doused in 
carbolic around their faces and tried not to breathe through their noses. Parliament was 
forced to recess early in 1858, and the following year it ordered that a programme of 
sewer-building begin. The thousands of miles of sewers that were built were 
constructed with a gentle slope from the west to the east, and, somewhere beyond 
Greenwich, they were pumped into the Thames Estuary, and the sewage was swept off 
into the North Sea. It was this journey that the body of the late marquis de Carabas was 
making, traveling west to east, toward the sunrise and the sewage works. 
Rats on a high brick ledge, doing the things that rats do when no people are 
watching, saw the body go by. The largest of them, a big black male, chittered. A 
smaller brown female chittered back, then she leapt down from the ledge onto the 
marquis's back and rode it down the sewer a little way, sniffing at the hair and the coat, 
tasting the blood, and then, precariously, leaning over, and scrutinizing what could be 
seen of the face. 
She hopped off the head into the filthy water and swam industriously to the side, 
where she clambered up the slippery brickwork. She hurried back a long a beam, and 
rejoined her companions. 
  
"Belfast?" asked Richard. 
Door smiled, impishly, and would say nothing more than, "You'll see," when he 
pressed her about it. 
He changed his tack. "How do you know that kid was telling you the truth about 
the market?" he asked. 
"It's not something anyone down here ever lies about. I . . . don't think we can lie 
about it." She paused. "The market's special." 
"How did that kid know where it was?" 
"Someone told him," said Hunter. 
Richard brooded on this for a moment. "How did they know?" 
"Someone told them," explained Door. 
"But . . . " He wondered who chose the locations in the first place, how the 
knowledge was spread, trying to frame the question in such a way that he did not sound 
stupid. 
A rich female voice asked from the darkness, "Hss. Any idea when the next 
market is?" 
She stepped into the light. She wore silver jewelry, and her dark hair was perfectly 
coifed. She was very pale, and her long dress was jet black velvet. Richard knew 
immediately that he had seen her before, but it took him a few moments to place her: 
the first Floating Market, that was it—in Harrods. She had smiled at him. 
"Tonight," said Hunter. "Belfast." 
"Thank you," said the woman. She had the most amazing eyes, thought Richard. 
They were the color of foxgloves. 
"I'll see you there," she said, and she looked at Richard as she said it. Then she 
looked away, a little shyly; she stepped into the shadows, and she was gone. 

"Who was that?" asked Richard. 
"They call themselves Velvets," said Door. "They sleep down here during the day, 
and walk the Up-world at night." 
"Are they dangerous?" asked Richard. 
"Everybody's dangerous," said Hunter. 
"Look," said Richard. "Going back to the market. Who decides where it gets held, 
and when? And how do the first people find out where it's being held?" Hunter 
shrugged. "Door?" he asked. 
"I've never thought about it." They turned a corner. Door held up her lamp. "Not 
bad at all," said Door. 
"And fast, too," said Hunter. She touched the painting on the rock wall with her 
fingertip. The paint was still wet. It was a painting of Hunter and Door and Richard. It 
was not flattering. 
  
The black rat entered the lair of the Golden deferentially, his head lowered, ears 
back. He crawled forward, squeeing and chittering. 
The Golden had made their lair in a pile of bones. This pile of bones had once 
belonged to a woolly mammoth, back in the cold times when the great hairy beasts 
walked across the snowy tundra of the south of England as if, in the opinion of the 
Golden, they owned the place. This particular mammoth, at least, had been disabused of 
that idea rather thoroughly and quite terminally by the Golden. 
The black rat made its obeisance at the base of the bone pile. Then he lay on his 
back with his throat exposed, closed his eyes, and waited. After a while a chittering 
from above told him that he could roll over. 
One of the Golden crawled out of the mammoth skull, on top of the heap of bones. 
It crawled along the old ivory tusk, a golden-furred rat with copper-colored eyes, the 
size of a large house cat. 
The black rat spoke. The Golden thought, briefly, and chattered an order. The 
black rat rolled on his back, exposing his throat again, for a moment. Then a twist and a 
wriggle, and he was on his way. 
  
There had been Sewer Folk before the Great Stink, of course, living in the 
Elizabethan sewers, or the Restoration sewers, or the Regency sewers, as more and 
more of London's waterways were forced into pipes and covered passages, as the 
expanding population produced more filth, more rubbish, more effluent; but after the 
Great Stink, after the great plan of Victorian sewer-building, that was when the Sewer 
Folk came into their own. They could be found anywhere in the length and breadth of 
the sewers, but they made their permanent homes in some of the churchlike red-brick 
vaults toward the east, at the confluence of many of the churning foamy waters. There 
they would sit, rods and nets and improvised hooks beside them, and watch the surface 
of the brown water. 
They wore clothes—brown and green clothes, covered in a thick layer of 
something that might have been mold and might have been a petrochemical ooze, and 

might, conceivably, have been something much worse. They wore their hair long and 
matted. They smelled more or less as one would imagine. Old storm lanterns were hung 
about the tunnel. Nobody knew what the Sewer Folk used for fuel, but their lanterns 
burned with a rather noxious blue-and-green flame. 
It was not known how the Sewer Folk communicated among themselves. In their 
few dealings with the outside world, they used a kind of sign language. They lived in a 
world of gurgles and drips, the men, the women, and the silent little sewer children. 
Dunnikin spotted something in the water. He was the chief of the Sewer Folk, the 
wisest and the oldest. He knew the sewers better than their original builders did. 
Dunnikin reached for a long shrimping net; one practiced hand movement and he was 
fishing out a rather bedraggled mobile telephone from the water. He walked over to a 
small heap of rubbish in the corner and put the telephone down with the rest of their 
haul. The day's catch so far consisted of two odd gloves, a shoe, a cat skull, a sodden 
packet of cigarettes, an artificial leg, a dead cocker spaniel, a pair of antlers (mounted), 
and the bottom half of a baby carriage. 
It had not been a good day. And tonight was a market night, in the open air. So 
Dunnikin kept his eyes on the water. You never knew what would turn up. 
  
Old Bailey was hanging his wash out to dry. Blankets and sheets fluttered and 
blew in the wind on the top of Centre Point, the ugly and distinctive sixties skyscraper 
that marks the eastern end of Oxford Street, far above Tottenham Court Road Station. 
Old Bailey did not care very much for Centre Point itself, but, as he'd often tell the 
birds, the view from the top was without compare, and, furthermore, the top of Centre 
Point was one of the few places in the West End of London where you did not have to 
look at Centre Point itself. 
The wind ripped feathers from Old Bailey's coat and blew them away, off over 
London. He did not mind. As he also often told his birds, there were more where those 
came from. 
A large black rat crawled out through a ripped air-vent cover, looked around, then 
came over to Old Bailey's bird-spattered tent. It ran up the side of the tent, then along 
the top of Old Bailey's washing line. It squealed at him, urgently. 
"Slower, slower," said Old Bailey. The rat repeated itself, at a lower pitch, but just 
as urgently. "Bless me," said Old Bailey. He ran into his tent and returned with 
weapons—his toasting fork and a coal shovel. Then he hurried back into the tent again 
and came out with some bargaining tools. And then he walked back into the tent for the 
last time, and opened his wooden chest, and pocketed the silver box. "I really don't have 
time for this tomfoolery," he told the rat, on his final exit from the tent. "I'm a very busy 
man. Birds don't catch themselves, y'know." 
The rat squeaked at him. Old Bailey was unfastening the coil of rope around his 
middle. "Well," he told the rat, "there's others could get the body. I'm not as young as I 
was. I don't like the under-places. I'm a roof-man, I am, born and bred." 
The rat made a rude noise. 
"More haste, less speed," replied Old Bailey. "I'm goin'. Young whippersnapper. I 
knew your great-great-grandfather, young feller-me-rat, so don't you try putting on airs 

. . . Now, where's the market going to be?" The rat told him. Then Old Bailey put the rat 
in his pocket and climbed over the side of the building. 
  
Sitting on the ledge beside the sewer, in his plastic lawn chair, Dunnikin was 
overcome by a presentiment of wealth and prosperity. He could feel it drifting from 
west to east, toward them. 
He clapped his hands, loudly. Other men ran to him, and the women, and the 
children, seizing hooks and nets and lines as they did so. They assembled along the 
slippery sewer ledge, in the sputtering green light of their lanterns. Dunnikin pointed, 
and they waited, in silence, which is how the Sewer Folk wait. 
The body of the marquis de Carabas came floating facedown along the sewer, the 
current carrying him as slow and stately as a funeral barge. They pulled it in with their 
hooks and their nets, in silence, and soon had it up on the ledge. They removed the coat, 
the boots, the gold pocket-watch, and the contents of the coat pockets, although they 
left the rest of the clothes on the corpse. 
Dunnikin beamed at the loot. He clapped again, and the Sewer Folk began to ready 
themselves for the market. Now they truly had something of value to sell. 
  
"Are you sure the marquis will be at the market?" Richard asked Door, as the path 
began, slowly, to climb. 
"He won't let us down," she said, as confidently as she could. "I'm sure he'll be 
there." 

FOURTEEN 
HMS Belfast is a gunship of 11,000 tons, commissioned in 1939, which saw active 
service in the Second World War. Since then it has been moored on the south bank of 
the Thames, in postcard-land, between Tower Bridge and London Bridge, opposite the 
Tower of London. From its deck one can see St. Paul's Cathedral and the gilt top of the 
columnlike Monument to the Great Fire of London erected, as so much of London was 
erected, by Christopher Wren. The ship serves as a floating museum, as a memorial, as 
a training ground. 
There is a walkway onto the ship from the shore, and they came down the 
walkway in their twos and threes, and in their dozens. They set up their stalls as early as 
they could, all the tribes of London Below, united both by the Market Truce and by a 
mutual desire to pitch their own stalls as far as possible from the Sewer Folk's stall. 
It had been agreed well over a century before that the Sewer Folk could only set 
up a stall at those markets held in the open air. Dunnikin and his folk dumped their 
booty in a large pile on a rubber sheet, beneath a large gun tower. Nobody ever came to 
the Sewer Folk's stall immediately: but toward the end of the market they would come, 
the bargain hunters, the curious, and those few fortunate individuals blessed with no 
sense of smell. 
Richard and Hunter and Door pushed their way through the crowds on the deck. 
Richard realized that he had somehow lost the need to stop and stare. The people here 
were no less strange than at the last Floating Market, but, he supposed, he was every bit 
as strange to them, wasn't he? He looked around, scanning the faces in the crowd as 
they walked, hunting for the marquis's ironic smile. "I don't see him," he said. 
They were approaching a smith's stall, where a man who could easily have passed 
for a small mountain, if one were to overlook the shaggy brown beard, tossed a lump of 
red-molten metal from a brazier onto an anvil. Richard had never seen a real anvil 
before. He could feel the heat from the molten metal and the brazier from a dozen feet 
away. 
"Keep looking. De Carabas'll turn up," said Door, looking behind them. "Like a 
bad penny." She thought for a moment, and added, "What exactly is a bad penny 
anyway?" And then, before Richard could answer, she squealed, "Hammersmith!" 
The bearded mountain-man looked up, stopped hitting the molten metal, and 
roared, "By the Temple and the Arch. Lady Door!" Then he picked her up, as if she 
weighed no more than a mouse. 
"Hello, Hammersmith," said Door. "I hoped you'd be here." 
"Never miss a market, lady," he thundered, cheerfully. Then he confided, like an 
explosion with a secret, "This's where the business is, y'see. Now," he said, recollecting 
the cooling lump of metal on his anvil, "just you wait here a moment." He put Door 
down at eye level, on the top of his booth,, seven feet above the deck. 
He banged the lump of metal with his hammer, twisting it as he did so with 
implements Richard assumed, correctly, were tongs. Under the hammer blows it 
changed from a shapeless blob of orange metal into a perfect black rose. It was a work 

of astonishing delicacy, each petal perfect and distinct. Hammersmith dipped the rose 
into a bucket of cold water beside the anvil: it hissed and steamed. Then he pulled it out 
of the bucket, wiped it, and handed it to a fat man in chain mail who was standing, 
patiently, to one side; the fat man professed himself well satisfied and gave 
Hammersmith, in return, a green plastic Marks and Spencer shopping bag, filled with 
various kinds of cheese. 
"Hammersmith?" said Door, from her perch. "These are my friends." 
Hammersmith enveloped Richard's hand in one several sizes up. His handshake 
was enthusiastic, but very gentle, as if he had, in the past, had a number of accidents 
shaking hands and had practiced it until he got it right. "Charmed," he boomed. 
"Richard," said Richard. 
Hammersmith looked delighted. "Richard! Fine name! I had a horse called 
Richard." He let go of Richard's hand, turned to Hunter, and said, "And you are . . . 
Hunter? Hunter! As I live, breathe, and defecate! It is!" Hammersmith blushed like a 
schoolboy. He spat on his hand and attempted, awkwardly, to plaster his hair back. 
Then he stuck his hand out and realized that he had just spat on it, and he wiped it on 
his leather apron, and shifted his weight from foot to foot. 
"Hammersmith," said Hunter, with a perfect caramel smile. 
"Hammersmith?" asked Door. "Will you help me down?" 
He looked shamefaced. "Beg pardon, lady," he said, and lifted her down. It came 
to Richard then that Hammersmith had known Door as a small child, and he found 
himself feeling unaccountably jealous of the huge man. "Now," Hammersmith was 
saying to Door, "What can I do for you?" 
"Couple of things," she said. "But first of all—" She turned to Richard. "Richard? 
I've got a job for you." 
Hunter raised an eyebrow. "For him?" 
Door nodded. "For both of you. Will you go and find us some food? Please?" 
Richard felt oddly proud. He had proved himself in the ordeal. He was One of Them. 
He would Go, and he would Bring Back Food. He puffed out his chest. 
"I am your bodyguard. I stay by your side," said Hunter. 
Door grinned. Her eyes flashed. "In the market? It's okay, Hunter. Market Truce 
holds. No one's going to touch me here. And Richard needs looking after more than I 
do." Richard deflated, but no one was watching. 
"And what if someone violates the Truce?" asked Hunter. 
Hammersmith shivered, despite the heat of his brazier. "Violate the Market Truce? 
Brrrr." 
"It's not going to happen. Go on. Both of you. Curry, please. And get me some 
papadums, please. Spicy ones." 
Hunter ran her hand through her hair. Then she turned and walked off into the 
crowd, and Richard went with her. "So what would happen if someone violated Market 
Truce?" asked Richard, as they pushed through the crowds. 

Hunter thought about this for a moment. "The last time it happened was about 
three hundred years ago. A couple of friends got into an argument over a woman, in the 
market. A knife was pulled and one of them died. The other fled." 
"What happened to him? Was he killed?" 
Hunter shook her head. "Quite the opposite. He still wishes he had been the one to 
have died." 
"He's still alive?" 
Hunter pursed her lips. "Ish," she said, after a while. "Alive-ish." 
A moment passed, then "Phew," Richard thought he was going to be ill. "What's 
that—that stink?" 
"Sewer Folk." 
Richard averted his head and tried not to breathe through his nose until they were 
well away from the Sewer Folk's stall. 
"Any sign of the marquis yet?" he asked. Hunter shook her head. She could have 
reached out her hand and touched him. They went up a gangplank, toward the food 
stalls, and more welcoming aromas. 
  
Old Bailey found the Sewer Folk with little difficulty, following his nose. 
He knew what he had to do, and he took a certain pleasure in making a bit of a 
performance of it, ostentatiously examining the dead cocker spaniel, the artificial leg, 
and the damp and moldy portable telephone, and shaking his head dolorously at each of 
them. Then he made a point of noticing the marquis's body. He scratched his nose. He 
put on his spectacles and peered at it. He nodded to himself, glumly, hoping to give the 
vague impression of being a man in need of a corpse who was disappointed by the 
selection but was going to have to make do with what they had. Then he beckoned to 
Dunnikin, and pointed to the corpse. 
Dunnikin opened his hands wide, smiled beatifically, and gazed up toward the 
heavens, conveying the bliss with which the marquis's remains had entered their life. 
He put a hand to his forehead, lowered it, and looked devastated, in order to convey the 
tragedy that losing such a remarkable corpse would be. 
Old Bailey put a hand in his pocket and produced a half-used stick of deodorant. 
He handed it to Dunnikin, who squinted at it, licked it, and handed it back, 
unimpressed. Old Bailey pocketed it. He looked back at the corpse of the marquis de 
Carabas, half-dressed, barefoot, still damp from its journey through the sewers. The 
body was ashen, drained of blood from many cuts, small and large, and the skin was 
wrinkled and prunelike from its time in the water. 
Then he pulled out a bottle, three-quarters filled with a yellow liquid, and passed it 
to Dunnikin. Dunnikin looked at it suspiciously. The Sewer Folk know what a bottle of 
Chanel No. 5 looks like, and they gathered around Dunnikin, staring. Carefully, self-
importantly, he unscrewed the top of the bottle and dabbed the tiniest amount on his 
wrist. Then, with a gravity the finest Parisian parfumier would have envied, Dunnikin 
sniffed. Then he nodded his head, enthusiastically, and approached Old Bailey to 
embrace him and conclude the deal. The old man averted his face and held his breath 
until the embrace was concluded. 

Old Bailey held up one finger and tried his best to mime that he was not so young 
as once he was and that, dead or not, the marquis de Carabas was a bit on the heavy 
side. Dunnikin picked his nose thoughtfully, and then, with a hand gesture indicating 
not only magnanimity but also a foolish and misplaced generosity that would, 
obviously, send him, Dunnikin, and the rest of the Sewer Folk, to the poorhouse, he had 
one of the younger Sewer Folk tie the corpse to the bottom half of the old baby 
carriage. 
The old roof-man covered the body with a cloth, and he pulled it away from the 
Sewer Folk, across the crowded deck. 
  
"One portion of vegetable curry, please," said Richard, to the woman at the curry 
stall. "And, um, I was wondering. The meat curry. What kind of meat is it, then?" The 
woman told him. "Oh," said Richard. "Right. Um. Better just make that vegetable 
curries all round." 
"Hello again," said a rich voice beside him. It was the pale woman they had met in 
the caves, with the black dress and the foxglove eyes. 
"Hullo," said Richard, with a smile. "—Oh, and some papadums, please. You, um. 
Here for curry?" 
She fixed him with her violet gaze and said, in mock Bela Lugosi, "I do not eat . . . 
curry." And then she laughed, a lavish, delighted laugh, and Richard found himself 
realizing how long it had been since he had shared a joke with a woman. 
"Oh. Um. Richard. Richard Mayhew." He stuck out his hand. She touched it with 
her own hand, in something a little like a handshake. Her fingers were very cold, but 
then, late at night, at the end of autumn, on a ship out on the Thames, everything is very 
cold. 
"Lamia," she said. "I'm a Velvet." 
"Ah," he said. "Right. Are there a lot of you?" 
"A few," she said. 
Richard collected the containers with the curry. "What do you do?" he asked. 
"When I'm not looking for food," she said, with a smile, "I'm a guide. I know 
every inch of the Underside." 
Hunter, who Richard could have sworn had been over on the other side of the stall, 
was standing next to Lamia. She said, "He's not yours." 
Lamia smiled sweetly. "I'll be the judge of that," she said. 
Richard said, "Hunter, this is Lamia. She's a Velcro." 
"Vel-vet," corrected Lamia, sweetly. 
"She's a guide." 
"I'll take you wherever you want to go." 
Hunter took the bag with the food in it from Richard. "Time to go back," she said. 
"Well," said Richard. "If we're off to see the you-know-what, maybe she could 
help." 

Hunter said nothing; instead, she looked at Richard. Had she looked at him that 
way the day before, he would have dropped the subject. But that was then. "Let's see 
what Door thinks," said Richard. "Any sign of the marquis?" 
"Not yet," said Hunter. 
  
Old Bailey had dragged the corpse down the gangplank tied to its baby carriage-
base, like a ghastly Guy Fawkes, one of the effigies that, not so very long ago, the 
children of London had wheeled and dragged around in early November, displaying to 
passersby before tossing them to their flaming demise on the bonfires of the fifth of 
November, Bonfire Night. He pulled the corpse over Tower Bridge, and, muttering and 
complaining, he hauled it up the hill past the Tower of London. He made his way west 
toward Tower Hill Station and stopped a little before the station, beside a large gray jut 
of wall. It wasn't a roof, thought Old Bailey, but it would do. It was one of the last 
remnants of the London Wall. The London Wall, according to tradition, was built on 
the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, in the third century A.D., at 
the request of his mother Helena. At that point, London was one of the few great cities 
of the Empire that did not yet have a magnificent wall. When it was finished it enclosed 
the small city completely; it was thirty feet high, and eight feet wide, and was, 
unarguably, the London Wall. 
It was no longer thirty feet high, the ground level having risen since Constantine's 
mother's day (most of the original London Wall is fifteen feet below street level today), 
and it no longer enclosed the city. But it was still an imposing lump of wall. Old Bailey 
nodded vigorously to himself. He fastened a length of rope to the baby carriage, and he 
scrambled up the wall; then, grunting and 'bless-me'-ing, he hauled the marquis up to 
the top of the wall. He untied the body from the carriage wheels and laid it gently out 
on its back, arms at its side. There were wounds on the body that were still oozing. It 
was very dead. "You stupid bugger," whispered Old Bailey, sadly. "What did you want 
to get yourself killed for, anyway?" 
The moon was bright and small and high in the cold night, and autumn 
constellations speckled the blue-black sky like the dust of crushed diamonds. A 
nightingale fluttered onto the wall, examined the corpse of the marquis de Carabas, and 
chirruped sweetly. "None of your beak," said Old Bailey, gruffly. "You birds don't 
smell like flipping roses, neither." The bird chirped a melodious nightingale obscenity 
at him, and flew off into the night. 
Old Bailey reached into his pocket and pulled out the black rat, who had gone to 
sleep. It stared about it sleepily, then yawned, displaying a vast and ratty expanse of 
piebald tongue. "Personally," said Old Bailey to the black rat, "I'll be happy if I never 
smell anything ever again." He put it down by his feet on the stones of London Wall, 
and it chittered at him, and gestured with its front paws. Old Bailey sighed. Carefully, 
he took the silver box out of his pocket, and, from an inner pocket, he pulled the 
toasting fork. 
He placed the silver box on de Carabas's chest, then, nervously, he reached out the 
toasting fork, and flipped open the lid of the box. Inside the silver box, on a nest of red 
velvet, was a large duck's egg, pale blue green in the moonlight. Old Bailey raised the 
toasting fork, closed his eyes, and brought it down on the egg. 

There was a whup as it imploded. There was a great stillness for several seconds 
after that; then the wind began. It had no direction, but seemed somehow to be coming 
from everywhere, a swirling sudden gale. Fallen leaves, newspaper pages, all the city's 
detritus blew up from the ground and was driven through the air. The wind touched the 
surface of the Thames and carried the cold water into the sky in a fine and driving 
spray. It was a dangerous, crazy wind. The stall holders on the deck of the Belfast 
cursed it and clutched their possessions to keep them from blowing away. 
And then, when it seemed that the wind would become so strong that it would 
blow the world away and blow the stars away and send the people tumbling through the 
air like so many desiccated autumn leaves— 
Just then— 
—it was over, and the leaves, and the papers, and the plastic shopping bags, 
tumbled to the earth, and the road, and the water. 
High on the remnant of the London Wall, the silence that followed the wind was, 
in its way, as loud as the wind had been. It was broken by a cough; a horrid, wet 
coughing. This was followed by the sound of someone awkwardly rolling over; and 
then the sound of someone being sick. 
The marquis de Carabas vomited sewer water over the side of the London Wall, 
staining the gray stones with brown foulness. It took a long time to purge the water 
from his body. And then he said, in a hoarse voice that was little more than a grinding 
whisper, "I think my throat's been cut. Have you anything to bind it with?" 
Old Bailey fumbled in his pockets and pulled out a grubby length of cloth. He 
passed it to the marquis, who wrapped it around his throat a few times and then tied it 
tight. Old Bailey found himself reminded, incongruously, of the high-wrapped Beau 
Brummel collars of the Regency dandies. "Anything to drink?" croaked the marquis. 
Old Bailey pulled out his hip-flask and unscrewed the top, and passed it to the 
marquis, who swigged back a mouthful, then winced with pain, and coughed weakly. 
The black rat, who had watched all this with interest, now began to climb down the 
fragment of wall and away. It would tell the Golden: all favors had been repaid, all 
debts were done. 
The marquis gave Old Bailey back his hip-flask. Old Bailey put it away. "How are 
ye feeling?" he asked. 
"I've felt better." The marquis sat up, shivering. His nose was running, and his 
eyes flickered about: he was staring at the world as if he had never seen it before. 
"What did you have to go and get yourself killed for, anyway, that's what I want to 
know," asked Old Bailey. 
"Information," whispered the marquis. "People tell you so much more when they 
know you're just about to be dead. And then they talk around you, when you are." 
"Then you found out what you wanted to know?" 
The marquis fingered the wounds in his arms and his legs, "Oh yes. Most of it. I 
have more than an inkling of what this affair is actually about." Then he closed his eyes 
once more, and wrapped his arms about himself, and swayed, slowly, back and forth. 
"What's it like then?" asked Old Bailey. "Being dead?" 

The marquis sighed. And then he twisted his lips up into a smile, and with a glitter 
of his old self, he replied, "Live long enough, Old Bailey, and you can find out for 
yourself." 
Old Bailey looked disappointed. "Bastard. After all I done to bring you back from 
that dread bourne from which there is no returning. Well usually no returning." 
The marquis de Carabas looked up at him. His eyes were very white in the 
moonlight. And he whispered, "What's it like being dead? It's very cold, my friend. 
Very dark, and very cold." 
  
Door held up the chain. The silver key hung from it, red and orange in the light of 
Hammersmith's brazier. She smiled. "Fine work, Hammersmith." 
"Thank you, lady." 
She hung the chain around her neck and hid the key away inside her layers of 
clothes. "What would you like in return?" 
The smith looked abashed. "I hardly want to presume upon your good nature . . . " 
he mumbled. 
Door made her "get on with it" face. He bent down and produced a black box from 
beneath a pile of metalworking tools. It was made of dark wood, inlaid with ivory and 
mother-of-pearl, and was the size of a large dictionary. He turned it over and over in his 
hands. "It's a puzzle-box," he explained. "I took it in return for some smithing a handful 
of years back. I can't get it to open, though I've tried so hard." 
Door took the box and ran her fingers over the smooth surface. "I'm not surprised 
you haven't been able to open it. The mechanism's all jammed. It's completely fused 
shut." 
Hammersmith looked glum. "So I'll never find out what's in it." 
Door made an amused face. Her fingers explored the surface of the box. A rod 
slid-out of the side of the box. She half-pushed the rod back into the box, then twisted. 
There was a clunk from deep inside it, and a door opened in the side. "Here," said Door. 
"My lady," said Hammersmith. He took the box from her and pulled the door open 
all the way. There was a drawer inside the box, which he pulled open. The small toad, 
in the drawer, croaked and looked about itself with copper eyes, incuriously. 
Hammersmith's face fell. "I was hoping it would be diamonds and pearls," he said. 
Door reached out a hand and stroked the toad's head. "He's got pretty eyes," she 
said. "Keep him, Hammersmith. He'll bring you luck. And thank you again. I know I 
can rely on your discretion." 
"You can rely on me, lady," said Hammersmith, earnestly. 
  
They sat together on the top of the London Wall, not speaking. Old Bailey slowly 
lowered the baby carriage wheels to the ground below them. "Where's the market?" 
asked the marquis. 
Old Bailey pointed to the gunship. "Over there." 
"Door and the others. They'll be expecting me." 

"You aren't in any condition to go anywhere." The marquis coughed, painfully. It 
sounded, to Old Bailey, like there was still plenty of sewer in his lungs. "I've made a 
long enough journey today," de Carabas whispered. "A little farther won't hurt." He 
examined his hands, flexed the fingers slowly, as if to see whether or not they would do 
as he wished. And then he twisted his body around, and began, awkwardly, to climb 
down the side of the wall. But before he did so, he said, hoarsely and perhaps a little 
sadly, "It would seem, Old Bailey, that I owe you a favor." 
  
When Richard returned with the curries, Door ran to him and threw her arms 
around him. She hugged him tightly, and even patted his bottom, before seizing the 
paper bag from him and pulling it open with enthusiasm. She took a container of 
vegetable curry and began, happily, to eat. 
"Thanks," said Door, with her mouth full. "Any sign of the marquis yet?" 
"None," said Hunter. 
"Croup and Vandemar?" 
"No." 
"Yummy curry. This is really good." 
"Got the chain all right?" asked Richard. Door pulled the chain up from around her 
neck, enough to show it was there, and she let it fall again, the weight of the key pulling 
it back down. 
"Door," said Richard, "this is Lamia. She's a guide. She says she can take us 
anywhere in the Underside." 
"Anywhere?" Door munched a papadum. 
"Anywhere," said Lamia. 
Door put her head on one side. "Do you know where the Angel Islington is?" 
Lamia blinked, slowly, long lashes covering and revealing her foxglove-colored 
eyes. "Islington?" she said. "You can't go there . . . " 
"Do you know?" 
"Down Street," said Lamia. "The end of Down Street. But it's not safe." 
Hunter had been watching this conversation, arms folded and unimpressed. Now 
she said, "We don't need a guide." 
"Well," said Richard, "I think we do. The marquis isn't around anywhere. We 
know it's going to be a dangerous journey. We have to get the . . . the thing I got . . . to 
the Angel. And then he'll tell Door about her family, and he'll tell me how to get home." 
Lamia looked up at Hunter with delight. "And he can give you brains," she said, 
cheerfully, "and me a heart." 
Door wiped the last of the curry from her bowl with her fingers, and licked them. 
"We'll be fine, just the three of us, Richard. We cannot afford a guide." 
Lamia bridled. "I'll take my payment from him, not you." 
"And what payment would your kind demand?" asked Hunter. 
"That," said Lamia with a sweet smile, "is for me to know and him to wonder." 
Door shook her head. "I really don't think so." 

Richard snorted. "You just don't like it that I'm figuring everything out for once, 
instead of following blindly behind you, going where I'm told." 
"That's not it at all." 
Richard turned to Hunter. "Well, Hunter. Do you know the way to Islington?" 
Hunter shook her head. 
Door sighed. "We should get a move on. Down Street, you say?" 
Lamia smiled with plum-colored lips. "Yes, lady." 
By the time the marquis reached the market they were gone. 

FIFTEEN 
They walked off the ship, down the long gangplank, and onto the shore, where they 
went down some steps, through a long, unlit underpass, and up again. Lamia strode 
confidently ahead of them. She brought them out in a small, cobbled alley. Gaslights 
burned and sputtered on the walls. 
"Third door along," she said. 
They stopped in front of the door. There was a brass plate on it, which said: 
THE ROYAL SOCIETY 
FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY 
TO HOUSES 
And beneath that, in smaller letters: 
DOWN STREET. PLEASE KNOCK. 
"You get to the street through the house?" asked Richard. 
"No," said Lamia. "The street is in the house." Richard knocked on the door. 
Nothing happened. They waited, and they shivered from the early morning cold. 
Richard knocked again. Finally, he rang the doorbell. The door was opened by a sleepy-
looking footman, wearing a powdered, crooked wig and scarlet livery. He looked at the 
motley rabble on his doorstep with an expression that indicated that they had not been 
worth getting out of bed for. 
"Can I help you?" said the footman. Richard had been told to fuck off and die with 
more warmth and good humor. 
"Down Street," said Lamia, imperiously. 
"This way," sighed the footman. "If you'll wipe your feet." 
They walked through an impressive lobby. Then they waited while the footman lit 
each of the candles on a candelabra. They went down some impressive, richly carpeted 
stairs. They went down a flight of less impressive, less richly carpeted stairs. They went 
down a flight of entirely unimpressive stairs carpeted in a threadbare brown sacking, 
and, finally, they went down a flight of drab wooden stairs with no carpet on them at 
all. 
At the bottom of those stairs was an antique service elevator, with a sign on it. The 
sign said: 
OUT OF ORDER 
The footman ignored the sign and pulled open the wire outer door with a metallic 
thud. Lamia thanked him, politely, and stepped into the elevator. The others followed. 
The footman turned his back on them. Richard watched him through the wire mesh, 
clutching his candelabra, going back up the wooden stairs. There was a short row of 
black buttons on the wall of the elevator. Lamia pressed the bottom-most button. The 

metal lattice door closed automatically, with a bang. A motor engaged, and the elevator 
began, slowly, creakily, to descend. The four of them stood packed in the elevator. 
Richard realized that he could smell each of the women in the elevator with him: Door 
smelled mostly of curry; Hunter smelled, not unpleasantly, of sweat, in a way that made 
him think of great cats in cages at zoos; while Lamia smelled, intoxicatingly, of 
honeysuckle and lily of the valley and musk. 
The elevator continued to descend. Richard was sweating, in a clammy cold sweat, 
and digging his fingernails deep into his palms. In the most conversational tones he 
could muster, he said, "Now would be a very bad time to discover that one was 
claustrophobic, wouldn't it?" 
"Yes," said Door. 
"Then I won't," said Richard. And they went down. 
Finally, there was a jerk, and a clunk, and a ratcheting noise, and the elevator 
stopped. Hunter pulled open the door, looked about, and then stepped out onto a narrow 
ledge. 
Richard looked out of the open elevator door. They were hanging in the air, at the 
top of something that reminded Richard of a painting he had once seen of the Tower of 
Babel, or rather of how the Tower of Babel might have looked were it inside out. It was 
an enormous and ornate spiral path, carved out of rock, which went down and down 
around a central well. Lights flickered dimly, here and there in the walls, beside the 
paths, and, far, far below them, tiny fires were burning. It was at the top of the central 
well, a few thousand feet above solid ground, that the elevator was hanging. It swayed a 
little. 
Richard took a deep breath and followed the others onto the wooden ledge. Then, 
although he knew it was a bad idea, he looked down. There was nothing but a wooden 
board between him and the rock floor, thousands of feet below. There was a long plank 
stretched between the ledge on which they stood and the top of the rocky path, twenty 
feet away. "And I suppose," he said, with a great deal less insouciance than he 
imagined, "this wouldn't be a good time to point out that I'm really bad at heights." 
"It's safe," said Lamia. "Or it was the last time I was here. Watch." She walked 
across the board, a rustle of black velvet. She could have balanced a dozen books on 
her head and never dropped one. When she reached the stone path at the side, she 
stopped, and turned, and smiled at them encouragingly. Hunter followed her across, 
then turned, and waited beside her on the edge. 
"See?" said Door. She reached out a hand, squeezed Richard's arm. "It's fine." 
Richard nodded, and swallowed. Fine. Door walked across. She did not seem to be 
enjoying herself; but she crossed, nonetheless. The three women waited for Richard, 
who stood there. Richard noticed after a while that he did not seem to be starting to 
walk across the wooden plank, despite the "walk!" commands he was sending to his 
legs. 
Far above them, a button was pressed: Richard heard the thunk and the distant 
grinding of an elderly electric motor. The door of the elevator slammed closed behind 
him, leaving Richard standing, precariously, on a narrow wooden platform, no wider 
than a plank itself. 

"Richard!" shouted Door. "Move!" 
The elevator began to ascend. Richard stepped off the shaking platform, and onto 
the wooden board; then his legs turned to jelly beneath him, and he found himself on all 
fours on the plank, holding on for dear life. There was a tiny, rational part of his mind 
that wondered about the elevator: who had called it back up, and why? The rest of his 
mind, however, was engaged in telling all his limbs to clutch the plank rigidly, and in 
screaming, at the top of its mental voice, "I don't want to die." Richard closed his eyes 
as tightly as he could, certain that if he opened them, and saw the rock wall below him, 
he would simply let go of the plank, and fall, and fall, and— 
"I'm not scared of falling," he told himself. "The part I'm scared of is where you 
finish falling." But he knew he was lying to himself. It was the fall he was scared of—
afraid of flailing and tumbling helplessly through the air, down to the rock floor far 
below, knowing there was nothing he could do to save himself, no miracle that would 
save him . . .  
He slowly became aware that someone was talking to him. 
"Just climb along the plank, Richard," someone was saying. 
"I . . . can't," he whispered. 
"You went through worse than this to get the key, Richard," someone said. It was 
Door talking. 
"I'm really not very good at heights," he said, obstinately, his face pressed against 
the wooden board, his teeth chartering. Then, "I want to go home." He felt the wood of 
the plank pressing against his face. And then the plank began to shake. Hunter's voice 
said, "I'm really not sure how much weight the board will bear. You two put your 
weight here." The plank vibrated as someone moved along it, toward him. He clung to 
it, with his eyes closed. Then Hunter said, quietly, confidently, in his ear, "Richard?" 
"Mm." 
"Just edge forward, Richard. A bit at a time. Come on . . . " Her caramel fingers 
stroked his white-knuckled hand, clasping the plank. "Come on." 
He took a deep breath, and inched forward. And froze again. "You're doing fine," 
said Hunter. "That's good. Come on." And, inch by inch, creep by crawl, she talked 
Richard along the plank, and then, at the end of the plank, she simply picked him up, 
her hands beneath his arms, and placed him on solid ground. 
"Thank you," he said. He could not think of anything else to say to Hunter that 
would be big enough to cover what she had just done for him. He said it again. "Thank 
you." And then he said, to all of them, "I'm sorry." 
Door looked up at him. "It's okay," she said. "You're safe now." Richard looked at 
the winding spiral road beneath the world, going down, and down; and he looked at 
Hunter and Door and Lamia; and he laughed until he wept. 
"What," Door demanded, when, at length, he had stopped laughing, "is so funny?" 
"Safe," he said, simply. Door stared at him, and then she, too, smiled. "So where 
do we go now?" Richard asked. 

"Down," said Lamia. They began to walk down Down Street. Hunter was in the 
lead, with Door beside her. Richard walked next to Lamia, breathing in the lily-of-the-
valley-honeysuckle scent of her, and enjoying her company. 
"I really appreciate you coming with us," he told her. "Being a guide. I hope it's 
not going to be bad luck for you or anything." 
She fixed him with her foxglove-colored eyes. "Why should it be bad luck?" 
"Do you know who the rat-speakers are?" 
"Of course." 
"There was a rat-speaker girl named Anaesthesia. She. Well, we got to be sort of 
friends, and she was guiding me somewhere. And then she got stolen. On Night's 
Bridge. I keep wondering what happened to her." 
She smiled at him sympathetically. "My people have stories about that. Some of 
them may even be true." 
"You'll have to tell me about them," he said. It was cold. His breath was steaming 
in the chilly air. 
"One day," she said. Her breath did not steam. "It's very good of you, taking me 
with you." 
"Least we could do." 
Door and Hunter went around the curve in front of them, and went out of sight. 
"You know," said Richard, "the other two are getting a bit ahead of us. We might want 
to hurry." 
"Let them go," she said, gently. "We'll catch up." It was, thought Richard, 
peculiarly like going to a movie with a girl as a teenager. Or rather, like walking home 
afterwards: stopping at bus shelters, or beside walls, to snatch a kiss, a hasty fumble of 
skin and a tangle of tongues, then hurrying on to catch up with your friends . . .  
Lamia ran a cold finger down his cheek. "You're so warm," she said, admiringly. -
"It must be wonderful to have so much warmth." 
Richard tried to look modest. "It's not something I think about much, really," he 
admitted. He heard, distantly, from above, the metallic slam of the elevator door. 
Lamia looked up at him, pleadingly, sweetly. "Would you give me some of your 
heat, Richard?" she asked. "I'm so cold." 
Richard wondered if he should kiss her. "What? I . . . " 
She looked disappointed. "Don't you like me?" she asked. He hoped, desperately, 
that he had not hurt her feelings. 
"Of course I like you," he heard his voice saying. "You're very nice." 
"And you aren't using all your heat, are you?" she pointed out, reasonably. 
"I suppose not . . . " 
"And you said you'd pay me for being your guide. And it's what I want, as my 
payment. Warmth. Can I have some?" 
Anything she wanted. Anything. The honeysuckle and the lily of the valley 
wrapped around him, and his eyes saw nothing but her pale skin and her dark plum-
bloom lips, and her jet black hair. He nodded. Somewhere inside him something was 

screaming; but whatever it was, it could wait. She reached up her hands to his face and 
pulled it gently down toward her. Then she kissed him, long and languorously. There 
was a moment of initial shock at the chill of her lips, and the cold of her tongue, and 
then he succumbed to her kiss entirely. 
After some time, she pulled back. 
He could feel the ice on his lips. He stumbled back against the wall. He tried to 
blink, but his eyes felt as if they were frozen open. She looked up at him and smiled 
delightedly, her skin flushed and pink and her lips, scarlet; her breath steamed in the 
cold air. She licked her red lips with a warm crimson tongue. His world began to go 
dark. He thought he saw a black shape at the edge of his vision. 
"More," she said. And she reached out to him. 
  
He watched the Velvet pull Richard to her for the first kiss, watched the rime and 
the frost spread over Richard's skin. He watched her pull back, happily. And then he 
walked up behind her, and, as she moved in to finish what she had begun, he reached 
out and seized her, hard, by the neck, and lifted her off the ground. 
"Give it back," he rasped in her ear. "Give him back his life." The Velvet reacted 
like a kitten who had just been dropped into a bathtub, wriggling and hissing and 
spitting and scratching. It did her no good: she was held tight by the throat. 
"You can't make me," she said, in decidedly unmusical tones. 
He increased the pressure. "Give him his life back," he told her, hoarsely and 
honestly, "or I'll break your neck." She winced. He pushed her toward Richard, frozen 
and crumpled against the rock wall. 
She took Richard's hand, and breathed into his nose and mouth. Vapor came from 
her mouth, and trickled into his. The ice on his skin began to thaw, the rime on his hair 
to vanish. He squeezed her neck again. "All of it, Lamia." She hissed, then, extremely 
grudgingly, and opened her mouth once more. A final puff of steam drifted from her 
mouth to his, and vanished inside him. Richard blinked. The ice on his eyes had melted 
to tears, and they were running down his cheeks. "What did you do to me?" he asked. 
"She was drinking your life," said the marquis de Carabas, in a hoarse whisper. 
"Taking your warmth. Turning you into a cold thing like her." 
Lamia's face twisted, like a tiny child deprived of a favorite toy. Her foxglove eyes 
flashed. "I need it more than he does," she wailed. 
"I thought you liked me," said Richard, stupidly. 
The marquis picked Lamia up, one-handed, and brought her face close to his. "Go 
near him again, you or any of the Velvet Children, and I'll come by day to your cavern, 
while you sleep, and I'll burn it to the ground. Understand?" 
Lamia nodded. He let go of her, and she dropped to the floor. Then she pulled 
herself up to her full size, which was not terribly tall, threw back her head, and spat, 
hard, into the marquis's face. She picked up the front of her black velvet dress and ran 
up the slope, and away, her footsteps echoing through the winding rock path of Down 
Street, while her ice-cold spittle ran down the marquis's cheek. He wiped it away with 
the back of his hand. 

"She was going to kill me," stammered Richard. 
"Not immediately," said the marquis, dismissively. "You would have died 
eventually, though, when she finished eating your life." 
Richard stared at the marquis. His skin was filthy, and he seemed ashen beneath 
the dark of his skin. His coat was gone: instead, he wore an old blanket wrapped about 
his shoulders, like a poncho, with something bulky—Richard could not tell what— 
strapped beneath it. He was barefoot, and, in what Richard took to be some kind of 
bizarre fashion affectation, there was a discolored cloth wrapped all the way around his 
throat. 
"We were looking for you," said Richard. 
"And now you've found me," croaked the marquis, drily. 
"We were expecting to see you at the market." 
"Yes. Well. Some people thought I was dead. I was forced to keep a low profile." 
"Why . . . why did some people think you were dead?" 
The marquis looked at Richard with eyes that had seen too much and gone too far. 
"Because they killed me," he said. "Come on, the others can't be too far ahead." 
Richard looked over the side of the path, across the central well. He could see 
Door and Hunter, across the well, on the level below. They were looking around—for 
him, he assumed. He called to them, shouted and waved, but the sound did not carry. 
The marquis laid a hand upon Richard's arm. "Look," he said. He pointed to the level 
beneath Door and Hunter. Something moved. Richard squinted: he could make out two 
figures, standing in the shadows. "Croup and Vandemar," said the marquis. "It's a trap." 
"What do we do?" 
"Run!" said the marquis. "Warn them. I can't run yet . . . go, damn you!" 
And Richard ran. He ran as fast as he could, as hard as he could, down the sloping 
stone road under the world. He felt a sudden stabbing pain in his chest: a stitch. And he 
pushed himself on, and still he ran. 
He turned a corner, and he saw them all. "Hunter! Door!" he gasped, breathless. 
"Stop! Watch out!" 
Door turned. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar stepped out from behind a pillar. Mr. 
Vandemar yanked Door's hands behind her back and bound them in one movement 
with a nylon strip. Mr. Croup was holding something long and thin in a brown cloth 
cover, like the kind Richard's father had used to carry his fishing poles in. Hunter stood 
there, her mouth open. Richard shouted, "Hunter. Quickly." 
She nodded, spun around, and kicked out one foot, in a smooth, almost balletic, 
motion. 
Her foot caught Richard squarely in the stomach. He fell to the floor several feet 
away, winded and breathless and hurt. "Hunter?" he gasped. 
"I'm afraid so," said Hunter, and she turned away. Richard felt sick, and saddened. 
The betrayal hurt him as much as the blow. 
Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar ignored Richard and Hunter entirely. Mr. Vandemar 
was trussing Door's arms, while Mr. Croup stood and watched. "Don't think of us as 

murderers and cutthroats, miss," Mr. Croup was saying, conversationally. "Think of us 
as an escort service." 
Hunter stood beside the rock face, looking at none of them, and Richard lay on the 
rock floor and writhed and tried, somehow, to suck air back into his lungs. Mr. Croup 
turned back to Door and smiled, showing many teeth. "You see, Lady Door. We are 
going to make sure you get safely to your destination." 
Door ignored him. "Hunter," she called, "what's happening?" Hunter did not move, 
nor did she answer. 
Mr. Croup beamed, proudly. "Before Hunter agreed to work for you, she agreed to 
work for our principal. Taking care of you." 
"We told you," crowed Mr. Vandemar. "We told you one of you was a traitor." He 
threw back his head, and howled like a wolf. 
"I thought you were talking about the marquis," said Door. 
Mr. Croup scratched his head of orange hair, theatrically. "Talking of the marquis, 
I wonder where he is. He's a bit late, isn't he, Mister Vandemar?" 
"Very late indeed, Mister Croup. As late as he possibly could be." 
Mr. Croup coughed sententiously and delivered his punch line. "Then from now 
on, we'll have to call him the late marquis de Carabas. I'm afraid he's ever-so-slightly—
" 
"Dead as a doornail," finished Mr. Vandemar. Richard finally managed to get 
enough air into his lungs to gasp, "You traitorous bitch." 
Hunter glanced at the ground. "No hard feelings," she whispered. 
"The key you obtained from the Black Friars," said Mr. Croup to Door. "Who has 
it?" 
"I do," gasped Richard. "You can search me, if you like. Look." He fumbled in his 
pockets—noticing something hard and unfamiliar in his back pocket, but there was no 
time to investigate that now—and he pulled out the front-door key of his old flat. He 
dragged himself to his feet and staggered over to Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. 
"Here." 
Mr. Croup reached over and took the key from him. "Good gracious me," he said; 
scarcely glancing at it. "I find myself utterly taken in by his cunning ploy, Mister 
Vandemar." He passed the key to Mr. Vandemar, who held it up between finger and 
thumb, and crushed it like brass foil. "Fooled again, Mister Croup," he said. 
"Hurt him, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup. 
"With pleasure, Mister Croup," said Mr. Vandemar, and he kicked Richard in the 
kneecap. Richard fell to the ground, in agony. As if from a long way away, he could 
hear Mr. Vandemar's voice; it appeared to be lecturing him. "People think it's how hard 
you kick that hurts," Mr. Vandemar's voice was saying. "But it's not how hard you kick. 
It's where. I mean, this's really a very gentle kick . . . "— something slammed into 
Richard's left shoulder. His left arm went numb, and a purple-white blossom of pain 
opened up in his shoulder. It felt like his whole arm was on fire, and freezing, as if 
someone had jabbed an electrical prod deep into his flesh, and turned up the current as 
high as it would go. He whimpered. And Mr. Vandemar was saying, " . . . but it hurts 

just as much as this—which is much harder . . . " and the boot rammed into Richard's 
side like a cannonball. He could hear himself screaming. 
"I've got the key," he heard Door say. 
"If only you had a Swiss army knife," Mr. Vandemar told Richard, helpfully, "I 
could show you what I do with all the different bits. Even the bottle-opener, and the 
thing for getting stones out of horses' hooves." 
"Leave him, Mister Vandemar. There will be time enough for Swiss army knives. 
Does she have the token?" Mr. Croup fumbled in Door's pockets, and took out the 
carved obsidian figure: the tiny Beast the angel had given her. 
Hunter's voice was low and resonant. "What about me? Where's my payment?" 
Mr. Croup sniffed. He tossed her the fishing pole case. She caught it one-handed. 
"Good hunting," said Mr. Croup. Then he and Mr. Vandemar turned and walked off 
down the twisting slope of Down Street, with Door between them. Richard lay on the 
floor and watched them go, with a terrible feeling of despair spreading outward from 
his heart. 
Hunter knelt on the ground and began to undo the straps on the case. Her eyes 
were wide and shining. Richard ached. "What is it?" he asked. "Thirty pieces of silver?" 
She pulled it, slowly, from its fabric cover, her fingers caressing it, stroking it, loving it. 
"A spear," she said, simply. 
It was made of a bronze-colored metal; the blade was long, and it curved like a 
kris, sharp on one side, serrated on the other; there were faces carved into the side of 
the haft, which was green with verdigris, and decorated with strange designs and odd 
curlicues. It was about five feet long, from the tip of the blade to the end of the haft. 
Hunter touched it, almost fearfully, as if it was the most beautiful thing she had ever 
seen. 
"You sold Door out for a spear," said Richard. Hunter said nothing. She wetted a 
fingertip with her pink tongue, then gently ran it across the side of the head of the spear, 
testing the edge on the blade; and then she smiled, as if she were satisfied with what she 
felt. "Are you going to kill me?" Richard asked. He was surprised to find himself no 
longer scared of death—or at least, he realized, he was not scared of that death. 
She turned her head, then, and looked at him. She looked more alive than he had 
ever seen her; more beautiful, and more dangerous. "And what kind of challenge would 
I have hunting you, Richard Mayhew?" she asked, with a vivid smile. "I have bigger 
game to kill." 
"This is your Great-Beast-of-London-hunting spear, isn't it?" he said. 
She looked at the spear in a way that no woman had ever looked at Richard. "They 
say that nothing can stand against it." 
"But Door trusted you. I trusted you." 
She was no longer smiling. "Enough." 
Slowly, the pain was beginning to abate, dwindling to a dull ache in his shoulder 
and his side and his knee. "So who are you working for? Where are they taking her? 
Who's behind all this?" 

"Tell him, Hunter," rasped the marquis de Carabas. He was holding a crossbow 
pointed at Hunter. His bare feet were planted on the ground; his face was implacable. 
"I wondered whether you were as dead as Croup and Vandemar claimed you 
were," said Hunter, barely turning her head. "You struck me as a hard man to kill." 
He inclined his head, in an ironic bow, but his eyes did not move, and his hands 
remained steady. "And you strike me that way too, dear lady. But a crossbow bolt to the 
throat, and a fall of several thousand feet may prove me wrong, eh? Put the spear down 
and step back." She placed the spear on the floor, gently, lovingly; then she stood up 
and stepped back from it. "You may as well tell him, Hunter," said the marquis. "I 
know; I found out the hard way. Tell him who's behind all this." 
"Islington," she said. 
Richard shook his head, as if he were trying to brush away a fly. "It can't be," he 
said. "I mean, I've met Islington. He's an angel." And then, almost desperately, he 
asked, "Why?" 
The marquis's eyes had not left Hunter, nor had the point of the crossbow wavered. 
"I wish I knew. But Islington is at the bottom of Down Street, and at the bottom of this 
mess. And between us and Islington is the labyrinth and the Beast. Richard, take the 
spear. Hunter, walk in front of me, please." 
Richard picked up the spear, and then, awkwardly, using the spear to lean on, he 
pulled himself up to a standing position. "You want her to come with us?" he asked, 
puzzled. 
"Would you prefer her behind us?" asked the marquis, drily. 
"You could kill her," said Richard. 
"I will, if there are no other alternatives," said the marquis, "but I would hate to 
remove an option, before it was entirely necessary. Anyway, death is so final, isn't it?" 
"Is it?" asked Richard. 
"Sometimes," said the marquis de Carabas. And they went down. 

SIXTEEN 
They walked for hours in silence, following the winding stone road downwards. 
Richard was still in pain; he was limping, and experiencing a strange mental and 
physical turmoil: feelings of defeat and betrayal roiled within him, which, combined 
with the near loss of his life to Lamia, the damage inflicted by Mr. Vandemar, and his 
experiences on the plank far above, left him utterly wrecked. Yet, he was certain that 
his experiences of the last day paled into something small and insignificant when 
placed beside whatever the marquis had experienced. So he said nothing. 
The marquis kept silent, as every word he uttered hurt his throat. He was content 
to let it heal, and to concentrate on Hunter. He knew that, should he let his attention 
flag for even a moment, she would know it, and she would be away, or she would turn 
on them. So he said nothing. 
Hunter walked a little ahead of them. She, also, said nothing. 
After some hours, they reached the bottom of Down Street. The street ended in a 
vast Cyclopean gateway—built of enormous rough stone blocks. Giants built that gate, 
thought Richard, half-remembered tales of long-dead kings of mythical London 
churning in his head, tales of King Bran and of the giants Gog and Magog, with hands 
the size of oak trees, and severed heads as big as hills. The portal itself had long since 
rusted and crumbled away. Fragments of it could be seen in the mud beneath their feet, 
dangling uselessly from a rusted hinge on the side of the gate. The hinge was taller than 
Richard. 
The marquis gestured for Hunter to stop. He moistened his lips, and said, "This 
gate marks the end of Down Street, and the beginning of the labyrinth. And beyond the 
labyrinth waits the Angel Islington. And in the labyrinth is the Beast." 
"I still don't understand," said Richard. "Islington. I actually met him. It. Him. He's 
an angel. I mean, a real angel." 
The marquis smiled, without humor. "When angels go bad, Richard, they go worse 
than anyone. Remember, Lucifer used to be an angel." 
Hunter watched Richard with nut brown eyes. "The place you visited is Islington's 
citadel, and also its prison," she said. It was the first thing she had said in hours. "It 
cannot leave." 
The marquis addressed her directly. "I assume that the labyrinth and the Beast are 
there to discourage visitors." 
She inclined her head. "So I would assume also." 
Richard turned on the marquis, all his anger and impotence and frustration 
spewing out of him in one angry blast. "Why are you even talking to her? Why is she 
still with us? She was a traitor—she tried to make us think that you were the traitor." 
"And I saved your life, Richard Mayhew," said Hunter, quietly. "Many times. On 
the bridge. At the gap. On the board up there." She looked into his eyes, and it was 
Richard who looked away. 

Something echoed through the tunnels: a bellow, or a roar. The hairs on the back 
of Richard's neck prickled. It was far away, but that was the only thing about it in 
which he could take any comfort. He knew that sound: he had heard it in his dreams, 
but now it sounded neither like a bull nor like a boar; it sounded like a lion; it sounded 
like a dragon. 
"The labyrinth is one of the oldest places in London Below," said the marquis. 
"Before King Lud founded the village on the Thames marshes, there was a labyrinth 
here." 
"No Beast, though," said Richard. 
"Not then." 
Richard hesitated. The distant roaring began again. "I . . . I think I've had dreams 
about the Beast," he said. 
The marquis raised an eyebrow. "What kind of dreams?" 
"Bad ones," said Richard. 
The marquis thought about this, eyes flickering. And then he said, "Look, Richard. 
I'm taking Hunter. But if you want to wait here, well, no one could accuse you of 
cowardice." 
Richard shook his head. Sometimes there is nothing you can do. "I'm not turning 
back. Not now. They've got Door." 
"Right," said the marquis. "Well then. Shall we go?" 
Hunter's perfect caramel lips twisted into a sneer. "You'd have to be mad to go in 
there," she said. "Without the angel's token you could never find your way. Never get 
past the boar." 
The marquis reached his hand under his poncho blanket and produced the little 
obsidian statue he had taken from Door's father's study. "One of these, you mean?" he 
asked. The marquis felt, then, that much of what he had gone through in the previous 
week was made up for by the expression on Hunter's face. They went through the gate, 
into the labyrinth. 
  
Door's arms were bound behind her back, and Mr. Vandemar walked behind her, 
one huge beringed hand resting on her shoulder, pushing her along. Mr. Croup scuttled 
on ahead of them, holding the talisman he had taken from her on high, and peering 
edgily from side to side, like a particularly pompous weasel on its way to raid the 
henhouse. 
The labyrinth itself was a place of pure madness. It was built of lost fragments of 
London Above: alleys and roads and corridors and sewers that had fallen through the 
cracks over the millennia, and entered the world of the lost and the forgotten. The two 
men and the girl walked over cobbles, and through mud, and through dung of various 
kinds, and over rotting wooden boards. They walked through daylight and night, 
through gaslit streets, and sodium-lit streets, and streets lit with burning rushes and 
links. It was an ever-changing place: and each path divided and circled and doubled 
back on itself. 

Mr. Croup felt the tug of the talisman, and let it take him where it wanted to go. 
They walked down a tiny alleyway, which had once been part of a Victorian 
"rookery"—a slum comprised in equal parts of theft and penny gin, of twopenny-
halfpenny squalor and threepenny sex—and they heard it, snuffling and snorting 
somewhere nearby. And then it bellowed, deep and dark. Mr. Croup hesitated, before 
hurrying forward, up a short wooden staircase; and then, at the end of the alley, he 
stopped, squinting about him, before he led them down some steps into a long stone 
tunnel that had once run across the Fleet Marshes, in the Templars' time. Door said, 
"You're afraid, aren't you?" Croup glared at her. "Hush your tongue." She smiled, 
although she did not feel like smiling. "You're scared that your safe-conduct token 
won't get you past the Beast. What are you planning now? To kidnap Islington? Sell 
both of us to the highest bidder?" 
"Quiet," said Mr. Vandemar. But Mr. Croup simply chuckled; and Door knew then 
that the Angel Islington was not her friend. 
She began to shout. "Hey! Beast! Here!" Mr. Vandemar cuffed her head and 
knocked her against the wall. "Said to be quiet," he told her, calmly. She tasted blood in 
her mouth and spat scarlet on the mud. Then she parted her lips to begin shouting once 
more. Mr. Vandemar, anticipating this, had taken a handkerchief from his pocket, and 
he forced it into her mouth. She tried to bite his thumb as he did so, but it made no 
appreciable impression on him. 
"Now you'll be quiet," he told her. Mr. Vandemar was very proud of his 
handkerchief, which was spattered with green and brown and black and had originally 
belonged to an overweight snuff dealer in the 1820s, who had died of apoplexy and 
been buried with his handkerchief in his pocket. Mr. Vandemar still occasionally found 
fragments of snuff merchant in it, but it was, he felt, a fine handkerchief for all that. 
They continued in silence. 
  
Richard made another entry in his mental diary. Today, he thought, I've survived 
walking the plank, the kiss of death, and a lecture on inflicting pain. Right now, I'm on 
my way through a labyrinth with a mad bastard who came back from the dead and a 
bodyguard who turned out to be a . . . whatever the opposite of a bodyguard is. I am so 
far out of my depth that . . . Metaphors failed him, then. He had gone beyond the world 
of metaphor and simile into the place of things that are, and it was changing him. 
They were wading through a narrow passage of wet, marshy ground, between dark 
stone walls. The marquis held both the token and the crossbow, and he took care to 
walk, at all times, about ten feet behind Hunter. Richard, in the lead, was carrying 
Hunter's Beast spear and a yellow flare the marquis had produced from beneath his 
blanket, which illuminated the stone walls and the mud, and he walked well in front of 
Hunter. The marshland stank, and huge mosquitoes had begun to settle upon Richard's 
arms and legs and face, biting him painfully and raising huge, itching welts. Neither 
Hunter nor the marquis so much as mentioned the mosquitoes. 
Richard was beginning to suspect that they were quite lost. It did not help his 
mood any that there were a large number of dead people in the marsh: leathery 
preserved bodies, discolored skeletal bones, and pallid, water-swollen corpses. He 
wondered how long the corpses had been there, and whether they had been killed by the 

Beast or by the mosquitoes. He said nothing as they walked on for another five minutes 
and eleven mosquito bites, and then he called out, "I think we're lost. We've been 
through this way before." 
The marquis held up the token. "No. We're fine," he said. "The token is leading us 
straight. Clever little thing." 
"Yeah," said Richard, who was not impressed. "Very clever." 
It was then that the marquis stepped, barefoot, on the shattered rib cage of a half-
buried corpse, puncturing his heel, and causing him to stumble. The little black statue 
went flying through the air and tumbled into the black marsh with the satisfied plop of a 
leaping fish returning to the water. The marquis righted himself and pointed the 
crossbow at Hunter's back. 
"Richard," he called. "I dropped it. Can you come back here?" Richard walked 
back, holding the flare high, hoping for the glint of flame on obsidian, seeing nothing 
but wet mud. "Get down into the mud and look," said the marquis. 
Richard groaned. 
"You've dreamed of the Beast, Richard," said the marquis. "Do you really want to 
encounter it?" 
Richard thought about this for not very long, then he pushed the haft of the bronze 
spear into the surface of the marsh and stood the flare up into the mud beside it, 
illuminating the surface of the marsh with a fitful amber light. He got down on his 
hands and knees in the bog, searching for the statue. He ran his hands over the surface 
of the marsh, hoping not to encounter any dead faces or hands. "It's hopeless. It could 
be anywhere." 
"Keep looking," said the marquis. 
Richard tried to remember how he usually found things. First he let his mind go as 
blank as he could, then he let his gaze wander over the surface of the marsh, 
purposelessly, idly. Something glittered on the boggy surface, five feet to his left. It 
was the Beast statue. "I can see it," called Richard. 
He floundered toward it through the mud. The little glassy beast was head-down in 
a puddle of dark water. Perhaps the mud was disturbed by Richard's approach; more 
likely, as Richard was convinced forever after, it was just the sheer cussedness of the 
material world. Whatever the cause, he was almost next to the little statue when the 
marsh made a noise that sounded like a giant stomach rumbling, and a large bubble of 
gas floated up and popped noxiously and obscenely beside the talisman, which 
vanished beneath the water. 
Richard reached the place where the talisman had been and pushed his arms deep 
into the mud, searching for it wildly, not caring what else his fingers might encounter. 
It was no use. It was gone forever. "What do we do now?" asked Richard. 
The marquis sighed. "Get back over here, and we'll figure out something." 
Richard said, quietly, "Too late." 
It was coming toward them so slowly, so ponderously that he thought for a 
fragment of a second that it was old, sick, even dying. That was his first thought. And 
then he realized how much ground it was covering as it approached, mud and foul 
water splashing up from its hooves as it ran, and he realized how wrong he had been in 

thinking it slow. Thirty feet away from them the Beast slowed, and stopped, with a 
grunt. Its flanks were steaming. It bellowed, in triumph, and in challenge. There were 
broken spears, and shattered swords, and rusted knives, bristling from its sides and 
back. The yellow flare light glinted in its red eyes, and on its tusks, and its hooves. 
It lowered its massive head. It was some kind of boar, thought Richard, and then 
realized that that had to be nonsense: no boar could be so huge. It was the size of an ox, 
of a bull elephant, of a lifetime. It stared at them, and it paused for a hundred years, 
which transpired in a dozen heartbeats. 
Hunter knelt, in one fluid motion, and pulled up the spear from the Fleet Marsh, 
which released it with a sucking noise. And, in a voice that was pure joy, she said, 
"Yes. At last." 
She had forgotten them all; forgotten Richard down in the mud, and the marquis 
and his foolish crossbow, and the world. She was delighted and transported, in a perfect 
place, the world she lived for. Her world contained two things: Hunter, and the Beast. 
The Beast knew that too. It was the perfect match, the hunter and the hunted. And who 
was who, and which was which, only time would reveal; time and the dance. 
The Beast charged. 
Hunter waited until she could see the white spittle dripping from its mouth, and as 
it lowered its head she stabbed up with the spear; but, as she tried to sink the spear into 
its side, she understood that she had moved just a fraction of a second too late, and the 
spear went tumbling out of her numbed hands, and a tusk sharper than the sharpest 
razor blade opened her side. And as she fell beneath its monstrous weight, she felt its 
sharp hooves crushing down on her arm, and her hip, and her ribs. And then it was 
gone, vanished back into the darkness, and the dance was done. 
  
Mr. Croup was more relieved than he would have admitted to be through the 
labyrinth. But he and Mr. Vandemar were through it, unharmed, as was their prey. 
There was a rock face in front of them, an oaken double door set in the rock face, and 
an oval mirror set in the right-hand door. 
Mr. Croup touched the mirror with one grimy hand. The surface of the mirror 
clouded at his touch, seethed for a moment, bubbling and roiling like a vat of boiling 
quicksilver, and then was still. The Angel Islington looked out at them. Mr. Croup 
cleared his throat. "Good morning, sir. It is us, and we have the young lady you sent us 
to fetch for you." 
"And the key?" The angel's gentle voice seemed to come from all around them. 
"Hanging around her swanlike neck," said Mr. Croup, a little more anxiously than 
he intended to. 
"Then enter," said the angel. The oak doors swung open at his words, and they 
went in. 
  
It had all happened so fast. The Beast had come out of the darkness, Hunter had 
snatched the spear, and it had charged her and disappeared back into the darkness. 
Richard strained to hear the Beast. He could hear nothing but, somewhere close to 
him, the slow drip, drip of water, and the high, maddening whine of mosquitoes. 

Hunter lay on her back in the mud. One arm was twisted at a peculiar angle. He crawled 
toward her, through the mire. "Hunter?" he whispered. "Can you hear me?" 
There was a pause. And then, a whisper so faint he thought for a moment he had 
imagined it, "Yes." 
The marquis was still some yards away, standing stock-still beside a wall. Now he 
called out, "Richard—stay where you are. The creature's just biding its time. It'll be 
back." 
Richard ignored him. He spoke to Hunter. "Are you . . . " he paused. It seemed 
such a stupid thing to say. He said it anyway. "Are you going to be all right?" She 
laughed, then, with blood-flecked lips, and shook her head. "Are there any medical 
people down here?" he asked the marquis. 
"Not in the sense you're thinking of. We have some healers, a handful of leeches 
and chirurgeons . . . " 
Hunter coughed, then, and winced. Bright red, arterial blood trickled from the 
corner of her mouth. The marquis edged a little closer. "Do you keep your life hidden 
anywhere, Hunter?" he asked. 
"I'm a hunter," she whispered, disdainfully. "We don't go in for that kind of thing 
. . . " She pulled air into her lungs with an effort, then exhaled, as if the simple effort of 
breathing were becoming too much for her. "Richard, have you ever used a spear?" 
"No." 
"Take it," she whispered. 
"But . . . " 
"Do it." Her voice was low and urgent. "Pick it up. Hold it at the blunt end." 
Richard picked up the fallen spear. He held it at the blunt end. "I knew that part," 
he told her. 
A glimmer of a smile breathed across her face. "I know." 
"Look," said Richard, feeling, not for the first time, like the only sane person in a 
madhouse. "Why don't we just stay very quiet. Maybe it'll go away. We'll try to get you 
some help." And, not for the first time, the person he was talking to ignored him utterly. 
"I did a bad thing, Richard Mayhew," she whispered, sadly. "I did a very bad 
thing. Because I wanted to be the one to kill the Beast. Because I needed the spear." 
And then, impossibly, she began to haul herself to her feet. Richard had not realized 
how badly she had been injured; nor could he now imagine what pain she must be in: 
he could see her right arm hanging uselessly, a white shard of bone protruding horribly 
from the skin. Blood ran from a cut in her side. Her rib cage looked wrong. 
"Stop it," he hissed, futilely. "Get down." 
With her left hand she pulled a knife from her belt, put it into her right hand, 
closed the nerveless fingers around the hilt. "I did a bad thing," she repeated. "And now 
I make amends." 
She began humming, then. Humming high and humming low, until she found the 
note that made the walls and the pipes and the room reverberate, and she hummed that 
note until it felt like the entire labyrinth must be echoing to her hum. And then, sucking 

the air into her shattered rib cage, she shouted, "Hey. Big boy? Where are you?" There 
came no reply. No noise but the low drip of water. Even the mosquitoes were quiet. 
"Maybe it's . . . gone away," said Richard, gripping the spear so tightly that it hurt 
his hands. 
"I doubt it," muttered the marquis. 
"Come on, you bastard," Hunter screamed. "Are you scared?" 
There was a deep bellow from off front of them, and the Beast came out of the 
dark, and it charged once more. This time there could be no room for mistakes. "The 
dance," whispered Hunter. "The dance is not yet over." 
As the Beast came toward her, its horns lowered, she shouted, "Now—Richard. 
Strike! Under and up! Now!" before the Beast hit her and her words turned into a 
wordless scream. 
Richard saw the Beast come out from the darkness, into the light of the flare. It all 
happened very slowly. It was like a dream. It was like all his dreams. The Beast was so 
close he could smell the shit-and-blood animal stench of it, so close he could feel its 
warmth. And Richard stabbed with the spear, as hard as he could, pushing up into its 
side and letting it sink in. 
A bellow, then, or a roar, of anguish, and hatred, and pain. And then silence. 
He could hear his heart, thudding in his ears, and he could hear water dripping. 
The mosquitoes began to whine once more. He realized he was still holding tight to the 
haft of the spear, although the blade of it was buried deep within the body of the 
immobile Beast. He let go of it, and staggered around the beast, looking for Hunter. She 
was trapped beneath the Beast. It occurred to him that if he moved her, pulling her out 
from under it, he might cause her death, so instead he pushed, as hard as he could, 
against the warm dead flanks of the Beast, trying to move it. It was like trying to push-
start a Sherman tank, but eventually, awkwardly, he tumbled it half-off her. 
Hunter lay on her back, staring up at the darkness above them. Her eyes were 
open, and unfocussed, and Richard knew, somehow, that they saw nothing at all. 
"Hunter?" he said. 
"I'm still here, Richard Mayhew." Her voice sounded almost detached. She made 
no effort to find him with her eyes, no effort to focus. "Is it dead?" 
"I think so. It's not moving." 
And then she laughed; it was a strange sort of laugh, as if she had just heard the 
funniest joke that ever the world told a hunter. And, between her spasms of laughter, 
and the wet, racking coughs that interrupted them, she shared the joke with him. "You 
killed the Beast," she said. "So now you're the greatest hunter in London Below. The 
Warrior . . . " And then she stopped laughing. "I can't feel my hands. Take my right 
hand." Richard fumbled under the Beast's body, and wrapped his hand around Hunter's 
chill fingers. They felt so small, suddenly. "Is there still a knife in my hand?" she 
whispered. 
"Yes." He could feel it, cold and sticky. 
"Take the knife. She's yours." 
"I don't want your . . . " 

"Take her." He pried the knife free from her fingers. "She's yours now," whispered 
Hunter. Nothing was moving, save her lips; and her eyes were clouding. "She's always 
looked after me. Clean my blood off her, though . . . mustn't rust the blade . . . a hunter 
always looks after her weapons." She gulped air. "Now . . . touch the Beast's blood . . . 
to your eyes and tongue . . . " 
Richard was not sure that he had heard her correctly, nor that he believed what he 
had heard. "What?" 
Richard had not noticed the marquis approach, but now he spoke intently into 
Richard's ear. "Do it, Richard. She's right. It'll get you through the labyrinth. Do it." 
Richard put his hand down to the spear, ran it up the haft until he felt the Beast's 
hide and the warm stickiness of the Beast's blood. Feeling slightly foolish, he touched 
his hand to his tongue, tasting the salt of the creature's blood: it did not, to his surprise, 
revolt him. It tasted utterly natural, like tasting an ocean. He touched his bloody fingers 
to his eyes, where the blood stung like sweat. 
Then, "I did it," he told her. 
"That's good," whispered Hunter. She said nothing more. 
The marquis de Carabas reached out his hand and closed her eyes. Richard wiped 
Hunter's knife on his shirt. It was what she had told him to do. It saved having to think. 
"Better get a move on," said the marquis, standing up. 
"We can't just leave her here." 
"We can. We can come back for the body later." 
Richard polished the blade as hard as he could on his shirt. He was crying, now, 
but he had not noticed. "And if there isn't any later?" 
"Then we'll just have to hope that someone disposes of all our remains. Including 
the Lady Door's. And she must be getting tired of waiting for us." Richard looked 
down. He wiped the last of Hunter's blood off her knife, and put it through his belt. 
Then he nodded. "You go," said de Carabas. "I'll follow as fast as I can." 
Richard hesitated; and then, as best he could, he ran. 
  
Perhaps it was the Beast's blood that did it; he certainly had no other explanation. 
Whatever the reason, he ran straight and true through the labyrinth, which no longer 
held any mysteries for him. He felt that he knew every twist, every path, every alley 
and lane and runnel of it. He ran, stumbling and falling, and still running, exhausted, 
through the labyrinth, his blood pounding in his temples. A rhyme coursed through his 
head, as he ran, pounding and echoing to the rhythm of his feet. It was something he 
had heard as a child. 
This aye night, this aye night 
Every night and all 
Fire and fleet and candlelight 
And Christ receive thy soul. 
The words went around and around, dirgelike, in his head. Fire and fleet and 
candlelight . . .  

At the end of the labyrinth was a sheer granite cliff, and set in the cliff were high 
wooden double doors. There was an oval mirror hanging on one of the doors. The doors 
were closed. He touched the wood, and the door opened, silently, to his touch. 
Richard went inside. 

SEVENTEEN 
Richard followed the path between the burning candles, which led him through the 
angel's vault to the Great Hall. He recognized his surroundings: this was where they 
had drunk Islington's wine: an octagon of iron pillars supporting the stone roof above 
them, the huge black stone and metal door, the old wooden table, the candles. 
Door was chained up, spread-eagled between two pillars beside the flint and silver 
door. She stared at him as he came in, her odd-colored pixie eyes wide and scared. The 
Angel Islington, standing beside her, turned and smiled at Richard as he entered. That 
was the most chilling thing of all: the gentle compassion, the sweetness of that smile. 
"Come in, Richard Mayhew. Come in," said the Angel Islington. "Dear me. You 
do look a mess." There was honest concern in its voice. Richard hesitated. "Please." 
The angel gestured, curling a white forefinger, urging him further in. "I think we all 
know each other. You know the Lady Door, of course, and my associates, Mister 
Croup, Mister Vandemar." Richard turned. Croup and Vandemar were standing on each 
side of him. Mr. Vandemar smiled at him. Mr. Croup did not. "I was hoping you would 
show up," continued the angel. It tipped its head on one side, and asked, "By the bye, 
where is Hunter?" 
"She's dead," said Richard. He heard Door gasp. 
"Oh. The poor dear," said Islington. It shook its head sadly, obviously regretting 
the senseless loss of human life, the frailty of all mortals born to suffer and to die. 
"Still," said Mr. Croup chirpily. "Can't make an omelette without killing a few 
people." 
Richard ignored them, as best he could. "Door? Are you all right?" 
"More or less, thanks. So far." Her lower lip was swollen, and there was a bruise 
on her cheek. 
"I am afraid," said Islington, "that Miss Door was proving a little intransigent. I 
was just discussing having Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar . . . " It paused. There 
were obviously some things it found distasteful actually to say. 
"Torture her," suggested Mr. Vandemar, helpfully. 
"We are," said Mr. Croup, "after all, famed across the entirety of creation for our 
skill in the excrutiatory arts." 
"Good at hurting people," clarified Mr. Vandemar. 
The angel continued, staring intently at Richard as it spoke, as if it had heard 
neither of them. "But then, Miss Door does not strike me as someone who will easily 
change her mind." 
"Give us time enough," said Mr. Croup. "We'd break her." 
"Into little wet pieces," said Mr. Vandemar. 
Islington shook his head and smiled indulgently at this display of enthusiasm. "No 
time," it said to Richard, "no time. However, she does strike me as someone who would 
indeed act to end the pain and suffering of a friend, a fellow mortal, such as yourself, 
Richard . . . " Mr. Croup hit Richard in the stomach, then: a vicious rabbit punch to the 

gut, and Richard doubled up. He felt Mr. Vandemar's fingers on the back of his neck, 
pulling him back to a standing position. 
"But it's wrong," said Door. 
Islington looked thoughtful. "Wrong?" it said, puzzled and amused. 
Mr. Croup pulled Richard's head close to his, and smiled his graveyard smile. 
"He's traveled so far beyond right and wrong he couldn't see them with a telescope on a 
nice clear night," he confided. "Now Mister Vandemar, if you'll do the honors?" 
Mr. Vandemar took Richard's left hand in his. He took Richard's little finger 
between his huge fingers and bent it back until it broke. Richard cried out. 
The angel turned, slowly. It seemed distracted by something. It blinked its pearl 
gray eyes. "There's someone else out there. Mister Croup?" There was a dark shimmer 
where Mr. Croup had been, and he was there no longer. 
  
The marquis de Carabas was flattened against the side of the red granite cliff, 
staring at the oak doors that led into Islington's dwelling. 
Plans and plots whirled through his head, each scheme fizzling out uselessly as he 
imagined it. He had thought he would have known what to do when he got to this point, 
and he was discovering, to his disgust, that he had absolutely no idea. There were no 
more favors to call in, no levers to press or buttons to push, so he scrutinized the doors 
and wondered whether they were guarded, whether the angel would know if they were 
opened. There had to be an obvious solution he was missing, if only he thought hard 
enough: perhaps something would occur to him. At least, he thought, slightly cheered, 
he had surprise on his side. 
That was until he felt the cold point of a sharp knife placed against his throat, and 
he heard Mr. Croup's oily voice whispering in his ear. "I already killed you once 
today," it was saying. "What does it take to teach some people?" 
  
Richard was manacled and chained between a pair of iron pillars when Mr. Croup 
returned, prodding the marquis de Carabas with his knife. The angel looked at the 
marquis, with disappointment on its face, then, gently, it shook its beautiful head. "You 
told me he was dead," it said. 
"He is," said Mr. Vandemar. 
"He was," corrected Mr. Croup. 
The angel's voice was a fraction less gentle and less caring. "I will not be lied to," 
it said. 
"We don't lie," said Mr. Croup, affronted. 
"Do," said Mr. Vandemar. 
Mr. Croup ran a grimy hand through his filthy orange hair, in exasperation. 
"Indeed we do. But not this time." 
The pain in Richard's hand showed no indication of subsiding. "How can you 
behave like this?" he asked, angrily. "You're an angel." 
"What did I tell you, Richard?" asked the marquis, drily. 

Richard thought. "You said, Lucifer was an angel." 
Islington smiled superciliously. "Lucifer?" it said. "Lucifer was an idiot. It wound 
up lord and master of nothing at all." 
The marquis grinned. "And you wound up lord and master of two thugs and a 
roomful of candles?" 
The angel licked its lips. "They told me it was my punishment for Atlantis. I told 
them there was nothing more I could have done. The whole affair was . . . " it paused, 
as if it were hunting for the correct word. And then it said, with regret, "Unfortunate." 
"But millions of people were killed," said Door. 
Islington clasped its hands in front of its chest, as if it were posing for a Christmas 
card. "These things happen," it explained, reasonably. 
"Of course they do," said the marquis, mildly, the irony implicit in his words, not 
in his voice. "Cities sink every day. And you had nothing to do with it?" 
It was as if the lid had been pulled off something dark and writhing: a place of 
derangement and fury and utter viciousness; and, in a time of scary things, it was the 
most frightening thing Richard had seen. The angel's serene beauty cracked; its eyes 
flashed; and it screamed at them, crazy-scary and uncontrolled, utterly certain in its 
righteousness, "They deserved it." 
There was a moment of silence. And then the angel lowered its head, and sighed, 
and raised its head, and said, very quietly and with deep regret, "Just one of those 
things." Then it pointed to the marquis. "Chain him up," it said. 
Croup and Vandemar fastened manacles around the marquis's wrists, and chained 
the manacles securely to the pillars beside Richard. The angel had turned its attention 
back to Door. It walked over to her, reached out its hand, placed it beneath her pointed 
chin, and raised her head, to stare into her eyes. "Your family," it said, gently. "You 
come from a very unusual family. Quite remarkable." 
"Then why did you have us killed?" 
"Not all of you," it said. Richard thought it was talking about Door, but then it 
said, "There was always the possibility that you might not have . . . worked out as well 
as you did." It released her chin and stroked her face with long, white fingers, and it 
said, "Your family can open doors. They can create doors where there were no doors. 
They can unlock doors that are locked. Open doors that were never meant to be 
opened." It ran its fingers down her neck, gently, as if it were caressing her, then closed 
its hand on the key about her neck. "When I was sentenced here, they gave me the door 
to my prison. And they took the key to the door, and put it down here too. An exquisite 
form of torture." It tugged, gently, on the chain, pulling it out from under Door's layers 
of silk and cotton and lace, revealing the silver key; and then it ran its fingers over the 
key, as if it were exploring her secret places. 
Richard knew, then. "The Black Friars were keeping the key safe from you," he 
said. 
Islington let go of the key. Door was chained up beside the door made of black 
flint and tarnished silver. The angel walked to it, and placed a hand on it, white against 
the blackness of the door. "From me," agreed Islington. "A key. A door. An opener of 
the door. There must be the three, you see: a particularly refined sort of joke. The idea 

being that when they decided I had earned forgiveness and my freedom, they would 
send me an opener, and give me the key. I just decided to take matters into my own 
hands, and will be leaving a little early." 
It turned back to Door. Once more it caressed the key. Then it closed its hand 
about the key and tugged, hard. The chain snapped. Door winced. "I spoke first to your 
father, Door," the angel continued. "He worried about the Underside. He wanted to 
unite London Below, to unite the baronies and fiefdoms—perhaps even to forge some 
kind of bond with London Above. I told him I would help him, if he would help me. 
Then I told him the nature of the help I needed, and he laughed at me." It repeated the 
words, as if it still found them impossible to believe. "He laughed. At me." 
Door shook her head. "You killed him because he turned you down?" 
"I didn't kill him," Islington corrected her, gently. "I had him killed." 
"But he told me I could trust you. He told me to come here. In his journal." 
Mr. Croup began to giggle. "He didn't," he said. "He never did. That was us. What 
was it he actually said, Mister Vandemar?" 
"Door, child, fear Islington," said Mr. Vandemar, with her father's voice. The 
voice was exact. "Islington's got to be behind all this. It's dangerous, Door— keep away 
from it—" 
Islington caressed her cheek, with the key. "I thought my version would get you 
here a little faster." 
"We took the journal," said Mr. Croup. "We fixed it, and we returned it." 
"Where does the door lead to?" called Richard. 
"Home," said the angel. 
"Heaven?" 
And Islington said nothing, but it smiled. 
"So, you figure they won't notice you're back?" sneered the marquis. "Just, 'Oh 
look, there's another angel, here, grab a harp and on with the hosannas'?" 
Islington's gray eyes were bright. "Not for me the smooth agonies of adulation, of 
hymns and halos and self-satisfied prayers," it said. "I have . . . my own agenda." 
"Well, now you've got the key," said Door. 
"And I have you," said the angel. "You're the opener. Without you the key is 
useless. Open the door for me." 
"You killed her family," said Richard. "You've had her hunted through London 
Below. Now you want her to open a door for you so you can single-handedly invade 
Heaven? You're not much of a judge of character, are you? She'll never do it." 
The angel looked at him then, with eyes older than the Milky Way. Then it said, 
"Ah me," and turned its back, as if it were ill-prepared to watch the unpleasantness that 
was about to occur. 
"Hurt him some more, Mister Vandemar," said Mr. Croup. "Cut off his ear." 
Mr. Vandemar raised his hand. It was empty. He jerked his arm, almost 
imperceptibly, and now he was holding a knife. "Told you one day you'd find out what 
your own liver tastes like," he said to Richard. "Today's going to be your lucky day." 

He slid the knife blade gently beneath Richard's earlobe. Richard felt no pain—perhaps, 
he thought, he had felt too much pain already that day, perhaps the blade was too sharp 
to hurt. But he felt the warm blood drip, wetly, from his ear down his neck. Door was 
watching him, and her elfin face and huge opal-colored eyes filled his vision. He tried 
to send her mental messages. Hold out. Don't let them make you do this. I'll be fine. 
Then Mr. Vandemar put a little pressure on the knife, and Richard bit back a scream. 
He tried to stop his face from grimacing, but another jab from the blade jerked a 
grimace and a moan from him. 
"Stop them," said Door. "I'll open your door." 
Islington gestured, curtly, and Mr. Vandemar sighed piteously and put his knife 
away. The warm blood dripped down Richard's neck and pooled and puddled in the 
hollow of his clavicle. Mr. Croup walked over to Door and unlocked the right-hand 
manacle. She stood there, rubbing her wrist, framed by the pillars. She was still chained 
to the pillar on the left, but she now had a certain amount of freedom of movement. She 
put her hand out for the key. "Remember," said Islington. "I have your friends." 
Door looked at him with utter contempt, every inch Lord Portico's oldest daughter. 
"Give me the key," she said. The angel passed her the silver key. 
"Door," called Richard. "Don't do it. Don't set it free. We don't matter." 
"Actually," said the marquis, "I matter very much. But I have to agree. Don't do 
it." 
She looked from Richard to the marquis, her eyes lingering on their manacled 
hands, on the heavy chains that bound them to the black iron pillars. She looked very 
vulnerable; and then she turned away, and walked to the limit of her own chain, until 
she stood in front of the black door made of flint and tarnished silver. There was no 
keyhole. She put the palm of her right hand on the door, and closed her eyes, let the 
door tell her where it opened, what it could do, finding those places inside herself that 
corresponded with the door. When she pulled her hand away, there was a keyhole that 
had not been there before. A white light lanced out from behind the keyhole, sharp and 
bright as a laser in the candlelit darkness of the hall. 
The girl pushed the silver key into the keyhole. There was a pause, and then she 
turned it in the lock. Something went click, and there was a chiming noise, and 
suddenly the door was framed in light. "When I am gone," said the angel, very quietly, 
to Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, with charm, and with kindness, and with compassion, 
"kill them all, howsoever, you wish." It turned back to the door, which Door was 
pulling open: it was opening slowly, as if there was great resistance. She was sweating. 
"So your employer's leaving," said the marquis to Mr. Croup. "I hope you've both 
been paid in full." 
Croup peered at the marquis, and said, "What?" 
"Well," said Richard, wondering what the marquis was trying to do, but willing to 
play along, "you don't think you're ever going to see him again, do you?" 
Mr. Vandemar blinked, slowly, like an antique camera, and said, "What?" 
Mr. Croup scratched his chin. "The corpses-to-be have a point," he said to Mr. 
Vandemar. He walked toward the angel, who stood, arms folded, in front of the door. 

"Sir? It might be wise for you to settle up, before you commence the next stage of your 
travels." 
The angel turned, and looked down at him as if he were less important than the 
least speck of dirt. Then it turned away. Richard wondered what it was contemplating. 
"It is of no matter now," said the angel. "Soon, all the rewards your revolting little 
minds can conceive of will be yours. When I have my throne." 
"Jam tomorrow, eh?" said Richard. 
"Don't like jam," said Mr. Vandemar. "Makes me belch." 
Mr. Croup waggled a finger at Mr. Vandemar, "He's welching out on us," he said. 
"You don't welch on Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar, me bucko. We collect our 
debts." 
Mr. Vandemar walked over to where Mr. Croup was standing. "In full," he said. 
"With interest," barked Mr. Croup. 
"And meat hooks," said Mr. Vandemar 
"From Heaven?" called Richard, from behind them. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar 
walked toward the contemplative angel. "Hey!" said Mr. Croup. 
The door had opened, only a crack, but it was open. Light flooded through the 
crack in the door. The angel took a step forward. It was as if it were dreaming with its 
eyes wide open. The light from the crack in the door bathed its face, and it drank it in 
like wine. "Have no fear," it said. "For when the vastness of creation is mine, and they 
gather about my throne to sing hosannas to my name, I shall reward the worthy and cast 
down those who are hateful in my sight." 
With an effort, Door wrenched the black door fully open. The view through the 
door was blinding in its intensity: a swirling maelstrom of color and light. Richard 
squinted his eyes, and turned his head away from the glare, all vicious orange and 
retinal purple. Is that what Heaven looks like? It seems more like Hell. 
And then he felt the wind. A candle flew past his head, and vanished through the 
door. And then another. And then the air was filled with candles, all spinning and 
tumbling through the air, heading for the light. If was as if the whole room were being 
sucked through the door. It was more than a wind, though. Richard knew that. His 
wrists began to hurt where they were manacled—it was as if, suddenly, he weighed 
twice as much as he ever had before. And then his perspective changed. The view 
through the doorway— it was looking down: it was not merely the wind that was 
pulling everything toward the door. It was gravity. The wind was only the air in the hall 
being sucked into the place on the other side of the door. He wondered what was on the 
other side of the door—the surface of a star, perhaps, or the event horizon of a black 
hole, or something he could not even imagine. 
Islington grabbed hold of the pillar beside the door, and held on desperately. 
"That's not Heaven," it shouted, gray eyes flashing, spittle on its perfect lips. "You mad 
little witch. What have you done?" 
Door was clutching the chains that held her to the black pillar, white-knuckled. 
There was triumph in her eyes. Mr. Vandemar had caught hold of a table leg, while Mr. 
Croup, in his turn, had caught hold of Mr. Vandemar. "It wasn't the real key," said 

Door, triumphantly, over the roar of the wind. "That was just a copy of the key I had 
Hammersmith make in the market." 
"But it opened the door," screamed the angel. 
"No," said the girl with the opal eyes, distantly. "I opened a door. As far and hard 
away as I could, I opened a door." 
There was no longer any trace of kindness or compassion on the angel's face; only 
hatred, pure and honest and cold. "I will kill you," it told her. 
"Like you killed my family? I don't think you're going to kill anyone anymore." 
The angel was hanging onto the pillar with pale fingers, but its body was at a 
ninety-degree angle to the room, and was most of the way through the door. It looked 
both comical and dreadful. It licked its lips. "Stop it," it pleaded. "Close the door. I'll 
tell you where your sister is . . . She's still alive . . . " Door flinched. 
And Islington was sucked through the door, a tiny, plummeting figure, shrinking 
as it tumbled into the blinding gulf beyond. The pull was getting stronger. Richard 
prayed that his chains and manacles would hold: he could feel himself being sucked 
toward the opening, and, from the corner of his eye, he could see the marquis dangling 
from his chains, like a string-puppet being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner. 
The table, the leg of which Mr. Vandemar was holding tightly, flew through the air 
and jammed in the open doorway. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar were dangling out of 
the door. Mr. Croup, who was clinging, quite literally, to Mr. Vandemar's coattails, 
took a deep breath and began slowly to clamber, hand over hand, up Mr. Vandemar's 
back. The table creaked. Mr. Croup looked at Door, and he smiled like a fox. "I killed 
your family," said Mr. Croup. "Not him. And now I'm—finally—going to finish the . . . 
" 
It was at that moment that the fabric of Mr. Vandemar's dark suit gave way. Mr. 
Croup tumbled, screaming, into the void, clutching a long strip of black material. Mr. 
Vandemar looked down at the flailing figure of Mr. Croup as it fell away from them. 
He, too, looked over at Door, but there was no menace in his gaze. He shrugged, as best 
as one can shrug while holding on to a table leg for dear life, and then he said, mildly, 
"Bye-bye," and let go of the table leg. 
Silently he plunged through the door, into the light, shrinking as he fell, heading 
for the tiny figure of Mr. Croup. Soon the two shapes merged into one little blob of 
blackness in a sea of churning purple and white and orange light, and then the black 
dot, too, was gone. It made some sort of sense, Richard thought: they were a team, after 
all. 
It was getting harder to breathe. Richard felt giddy and light-headed. The table in 
the doorway splintered and was sucked away through the door. One of Richard's 
manacles popped open, and his right arm whipped free. He grabbed the chain holding 
the left hand, and gripped it as tightly as he could, grateful that the broken finger was 
on the hand that was still in the manacle; even so, red and blue flashes of pain were 
shooting up his left arm. He could hear himself, distantly, shouting in pain. 
He could not breathe. White blotches of light exploded behind his eyes. He could 
feel the chain beginning to give way . . .  

The sound of the black door slamming closed filled his whole world. Richard fell 
violently back against the cold iron pillar, and slumped to the floor. There was silence, 
then, in the hall—silence, and utter darkness, in the Great Hall under the earth. Richard 
closed his eyes: it made no difference to the darkness, and he opened his eyes once 
more. 
The hush was broken by the marquis's voice, asking, drily, "So where did you send 
them?" And then Richard heard a girl's voice talking. He knew it had to be Door's, but 
it sounded so young, like the voice of a tiny child at bedtime, at the end of a long and 
exhausting day. "I don't know . . . a long way away. I'm . . . very tired now. I . . . " 
"Door," said the marquis. "Snap out of it." it was good that he was saying it, 
thought Richard, somebody had to, and Richard could no longer remember how to talk. 
There was a click, then, in the darkness: the sound of a manacle opening, followed by 
the sound of chains falling against a metal pillar. Then the sound of a match being 
struck. A candle was lit: it burned weakly, and flickered in the thin air. Fire and fleet 
and candlelight, thought Richard, and he could not remember why. 
Door walked, unsteadily, to the marquis, holding her candle. She reached out a 
hand, touched his chains, and his manacles clicked open. He rubbed his wrists. Then 
she walked over to Richard, and touched his single remaining manacle. It fell open. 
Door sighed, then, and sat down beside him. He reached out his good arm and cradled 
her head, holding her close to him. He rocked her slowly back and forth, crooning a 
wordless lullaby. It was cold, cold, there in the angel's empty hall; but soon the warmth 
of unconsciousness reached out and enveloped them both. 
The marquis de Carabas watched the sleeping children. The idea of sleep—of 
returning, even for a short time, to a state so horribly close to death—scared him more 
than he would have ever believed. But, eventually, even he put his head down on his 
arm, and closed his eyes. 
And then there were none. 

EIGHTEEN 
The Lady Serpentine, who was, but for Olympia, the oldest of the Seven Sisters, 
walked through the labyrinth beyond Down Street, her head held high, her white leather 
boots squashing through the dank mud. This was, after all, the furthest she had been 
from her house in over a hundred years. Her wasp-waisted majordomo, dressed from 
head to foot all in black leather, walked ahead of her, holding a large carriage-lamp. 
Two of Serpentine's other women, similarly dressed, walked behind her at a respectful 
distance. 
The ripped lace train of Serpentine's dress dragged in the mire behind her, but she 
paid it no mind. She saw something glinting in the lamplight ahead of them, and, beside 
it, a dark and bulky shape. 
"There it is," she said. 
The two women who had been walking, behind her hurried forward, splashing 
through the marsh, and as Serpentine's butler approached, bringing with her a swinging 
circle of warm light, the shape resolved into objects. The light had been glinting from a 
long bronze spear. Hunter's body, twisted and bloody and wretched, lay on its back, 
half-buried in the mud, in a large pool of scarlet gore, its legs trapped beneath the body 
of an enormous boar-like creature. Her eyes were closed. 
Serpentine's women hauled the body out from under the Beast, and lay it in the 
mud. Serpentine knelt in the wet mire and ran one finger down Hunter's cold cheek, 
until it reached her blood-blackened lips, where she let it linger for some moments. 
Then she stood up. "Bring the spear," said Serpentine. 
One of the women picked up Hunter's body; the other pulled the spear from the 
carcass of the Beast and put it over her shoulder. And then the four figures turned, and 
went back the way they had come; a silent procession deep beneath the world. The 
lamplight flickered on Serpentine's ravaged face as she walked; but it revealed no 
emotion of any kind, neither happy nor sad. 

NINETEEN 
For a moment, upon waking, he had NO idea at all who he was. It was a tremendously 
liberating feeling, as if he were free to be whatever he wanted to be: he could be anyone 
at all—able to try on any identity; he could be a man or a woman, a rat or a bird, a 
monster or a god. And then someone made a rustling noise, and he woke up the rest of 
the way, and in waking he found that he was Richard Mayhew, whoever that was, 
whatever that meant. He was Richard Mayhew, and he did not know where he was. 
There was crisp linen pressed against his face. He hurt all over; in some places—
the little finger on his left hand, for example—more than others. 
Someone was nearby. Richard could hear breathing, and the hesitant rustling 
noises of a person in the same room he was in, trying to be discreet. Richard raised his 
head, and discovered, in the raising, more places that hurt. Some of them hurt very 
badly. Far away—rooms and rooms away—people were singing. The song was so 
distant and quiet he knew he would lose it if he opened, his eyes: a deep, melodious 
chanting . . .  
He opened his eyes. The room was small, and dimly lit. He was on a low bed, and 
the rustling sound he had heard was made by a cowled figure in a black robe, with his 
back to Richard. The black figure was dusting the room, with an incongruously brightly 
colored feather duster. "Where am I?" asked Richard. 
The black figure nearly dropped its feather duster, then it turned, revealing a very 
nervous, thin, dark brown face. "Would you like some water?" the Black Friar asked, in 
the manner of one who has been told that if the patient wakes up, he is to be asked if he 
would like some water, and has been repeating it to himself over and over for the last 
forty minutes to make sure that he didn't forget. 
"I . . . " and Richard realized that he was most dreadfully thirsty. He sat up in the 
bed. "Yes, I would. Thank you very much." The friar poured some water from a 
battered metal jug into a battered metal cup and passed it to Richard. Richard sipped the 
water slowly, restraining the impulse to gulp it down. It was crystal cold and clear and 
tasted like diamonds and ice. 
Richard looked down at himself. His clothes were gone. He had been dressed in a 
long robe, like one of the Black Friars' habits, but gray. His broken finger had been 
splinted and neatly bandaged. He raised a finger to his ear; there was a bandage on it, 
and what felt like stitches beneath the bandage. "You're one of the Black Friars," said 
Richard. 
"Yes, sir." 
"How did I get here? Where are my friends?" 
The friar pointed to the corridor, wordlessly and nervously. Richard got out of the 
bed. He checked under his gray robe: he was naked. His torso and legs were covered in 
a variety of deep indigo and purple bruises, all of which seemed to have been rubbed 
with some kind of ointment: it smelt like cough syrup and buttered toast. His right knee 
was bandaged. He wondered where his clothes were. There were sandals beside the 
bed, and he put them on, then he walked out into the corridor. The abbot was coming 

down the passage toward him, holding onto the arm of Brother Fuliginous, his blind 
eyes pearlescent in the darkness beneath his cowl. 
"You are awake, then, Richard Mayhew," said the abbot. "How do you feel?" 
Richard made a face. "My hand . . . " 
"We set your finger. It had been broken. We tended your bruises and your cuts. 
And you needed rest, which we gave you." 
"Where's Door? And the marquis? How did we get here?" 
"I had you brought here," said the abbot. The two friars began to walk down the 
corridor, and Richard walked with them. 
"Hunter," said Richard. "Did you bring back her body?" 
The abbot shook his head. "There was no body. Only the Beast." 
"Ah, um. My clothes . . . " They came to the door of a cell, much like the one 
Richard had woken in. Door was sitting on the edge of her bed, reading a copy of 
Mansfield Park that Richard was certain the friars had not previously known that they 
had. She, too, wore a gray monk's robe, which was much, much too big for her, almost 
comically so. She looked up as they entered. "Hello," she said. "You've been asleep for 
ages. How are you feeling?" 
"Fine, I think. How are you?" 
She smiled. It was not a very convincing smile. "A bit shaky," she admitted. There 
was a loud rattling in the corridor, and Richard turned to see the marquis de Carabas 
being wheeled toward them in a rickety and antique wheelchair. The wheelchair was 
being pushed by a large Black Friar. Richard wondered how the marquis managed to 
make being pushed around in a wheelchair look like a romantic and swashbuckling 
thing to do. The marquis honored them with an enormous smile. "Good evening, 
friends," he said. 
"Now," said the abbot, "that you are all here, we must talk." 
He led them to a large room, warmed by a roaring scrap wood fire. They arranged 
themselves around a table. The abbot gestured for them all to sit down. He felt for his 
chair and sat down in it. Then he sent Brother Fuliginous and Brother Tenebrae (who 
had been pushing the marquis's wheelchair) out of the room. 
"So," said the abbot. "To business. Where is Islington?" 
Door shrugged. "As far away as I could send him. Halfway across space and 
time." 
"I see," said the abbot. And then he said, "Good." 
"Why didn't you warn us about him?" asked Richard. 
"That was not our responsibility." 
Richard snorted. "What happens now?" he asked them all. 
The abbot said nothing. 
"Happens? In what way?" asked Door. 
"Well, you wanted to avenge your family. And you have. And you've sent 
everyone involved off to some distant corner of nowhere. I mean, no one's going to try 
and kill you anymore, are they?" 

"Not for right now," said Door, seriously. 
"And you?" Richard asked the marquis de Carabas. "Have you got what you 
wanted?" 
The marquis nodded. "I believe so. My debt to Lord Portico has been paid in full, 
and the Lady Door owes me a significant favor." 
Richard looked to Door. She nodded. "So what about me?" he asked. 
"Well," said Door. "We couldn't have done it without you." 
"That's not what I meant. What about getting me back home?" 
The marquis raised an eyebrow. "Who do you think she is—the Wizard of Oz? We 
can't send you home. This is your home." 
Door said, "I tried to tell you that before, Richard." 
"There has to be a way," said Richard, and he slammed his left hand down on the 
table, hard, for emphasis. It hurt his finger, but he kept his face composed. And then he 
said, "Ow," but he said it very quietly, because he had gone through much worse. 
"Where is the key?" asked the abbot. 
Richard inclined his head. "Door," he said. 
She shook her pixy head. "I don't have it," she told him. "I slipped it back into 
your pocket at the last market. When you brought the curry." 
Richard opened his mouth, and then he closed it again. Then he opened it and said, 
"You mean, when I told Croup and Vandemar that I had it, and they were welcome to 
search me . . . I had it?" She nodded. He remembered the hard object in his back 
pocket, on Down Street; remembered her hugging him on the ship . . .  
The abbot reached out. His wrinkled brown fingers picked up a small bell from the 
table, which he shook, summoning Brother Fuliginous. "Bring me the Warrior's 
trousers," he said. Fuliginous nodded and left. 
"I'm no warrior," said Richard. 
The Abbot smiled gently. "You killed the Beast," he explained, almost regretfully. 
"You are the Warrior." 
Richard folded his arms, exasperated. "So, after all this, I still don't get to go 
home, but as a consolation prize I've made it onto some kind of archaic underground 
honors list?" 
The marquis looked unsympathetic. "You can't go back to London Above. A few 
individuals manage a kind of half-life—you've met Iliaster and Lear. But that's the best 
you could hope for, and it isn't a good life." 
Door reached out a hand, and touched Richard's arm. "I'm sorry," she told him. 
"But look at all the good you've done. You got the key for us." 
"Well," he asked, "what was the point of that? You just forged a new key—" 
Brother Fuliginous reappeared, carrying Richard's jeans; they were ripped, and covered 
in mud, and splashed with dried blood, and they stank. The friar handed the trousers to 
the abbot, who commenced to go through the pockets. Door smiled, sweetly. "I couldn't 
have had Hammersmith copy it without the original," she reminded him. 

The abbot cleared his throat. "You are all very stupid people," he told them, 
graciously, "and you do not know anything at all." He held up the silver key. It glinted 
in the firelight. "Richard passed the Ordeal of the Key. He is its master, until he returns 
it to our keeping. The key has power." 
"It's the key to Heaven . . . " said Richard, unsure of what the abbot was getting at, 
of what point he was trying to make. 
The old man's voice was deep and melodious. "The key is the key to all reality. If 
Richard wants to return to London Above, then the key will take him back to London 
Above." 
"It's that simple?" asked Richard. The old man nodded his blind head, beneath the 
shadows of his cowl. "Then when could we do this?" 
"As soon as you are ready," said the abbot. 
  
The friars had washed and repaired his clothes and returned them to him. Brother 
Fuliginous led him through the abbey, up a vertiginous series of ladders and steps, up 
into the bell tower. There was a heavy wooden trapdoor in the top of the tower. Brother 
Fuliginous unlocked it, and the two men pushed through it and found themselves in a 
narrow tunnel, thickly cobwebbed, with metal rungs set in the side of one wall. They 
climbed the rungs, going up for what seemed like thousands of feet, and came out on a 
dusty Underground station platform. 
NIGHTINGALE LANE 
said the old signs on the wall. Brother Fuliginous wished Richard well and told 
him to wait there and he would be collected, and then he clambered down the side of 
the wall, and he was gone. 
Richard sat on the platform for twenty minutes. He wondered what kind of station 
this was: it seemed neither abandoned, like British Museum, nor real, like Blackfriars: 
instead it was a ghost-station, an imaginary place, forgotten and strange. He wondered 
why the marquis had not said good-bye. When Richard had asked Door, she had said 
that she didn't know, but that maybe good-byes were something else, like comforting 
people, at which the marquis wasn't much good. Then she told him that she had 
something in her eye, and she gave him a paper with his instructions on, and she went 
away. 
Something waved from the darkness of the tunnel: something white. It was a 
handkerchief on a stick. "Hello?" called Richard. 
The feather-wrapped roundness of Old Bailey stepped out of the gloom, looking 
self-conscious and ill at ease. He was waving Richard's handkerchief, and he was 
sweating. "It's me little flag," he said, pointing to the handkerchief. 
"I'm glad it's come in useful." 
Old Bailey grinned uneasily. "Right. Just wanted to say. Something I got for you. 
Here you go." He thrust a hand into a coat pocket and pulled out a long black feather 
with a blue-purple-green sheen to it; red thread had been wound around the quill end of 
the feather. 

"Um. Well, thanks," said Richard, unsure of what he ought to do with it. 
"It's a feather," explained Old Bailey. "And a good one. Memento. Souvenir. 
Keepsake. And it's free. A gift. Me to you. Bit of a thank-you." 
"Yes. Well. Very kind of you." 
Richard put it in his pocket. A warm wind blew through the tunnel: a train was 
coming. "This'll be your train now," said Old Bailey. "I don't take trains, me. Give me a 
good roof any day." He shook Richard's hand, and fled. 
The train pulled in at the station, its headlights were turned off, and there was 
nobody standing in the driver's compartment in the front. It came to a full stop: all the 
carriages were dark, and no doors opened. Richard knocked on the door in front of him, 
hoping that it was the correct one. The door gaped open, flooding the imaginary station 
with warm yellow light. Two small, elderly gentlemen holding long, copper-colored 
bugles stepped off the train and onto the platform. Richard recognized them: Dagvard 
and Halvard, from Earl's Court; although he could no longer recall, if he had ever 
known, which gentleman was which. They put their bugles to their lips and performed a 
ragged, but sincere, fanfare. Richard got onto the train, and they walked in behind him. 
The earl was sitting at the end of the carriage, petting the enormous Irish 
wolfhound. The jester— Tooley, thought Richard, that was his name—stood beside 
him. Other than that, and the two men-at-arms, the carriage was deserted. "Who is it?" 
asked the earl. 
"It's him, sire," said his jester. "Richard Mayhew. The one who killed the Beast." 
"The Warrior?" The Earl scratched his red-gray beard thoughtfully. "Bring him 
here." 
Richard walked down to the earl's chair. The earl eyed him up and down pensively 
and gave no indication that he remembered ever meeting Richard before. "Thought 
you'd be taller," said the earl, at length. 
"Sorry." 
"Well, better get on with it." The old man stood up and addressed the empty car. 
"Good evening. Here to honor young Mayflower. What was it the bard said?" And then 
he recited, in a rhythmic alliterative boom, "Crimson the cuts in the carcass, Fast falls 
the foe, Dauntless devout defender, Bravest of boys . . . Not really a boy anymore, 
though, is he, Tooley?" 
"Not particularly, Your Grace." 
The earl reached out his hand. "Give me your sword, boy." 
Richard put his hand to his belt and pulled out the knife that Hunter had given him. 
"Will this do?" he asked. 
"Yes-yes," said the old man, taking the knife from him. 
"Kneel," said Tooley, in a stage whisper, pointing to the train floor. Richard went 
down on one knee; the earl tapped him gently on each shoulder with the knife. "Arise," 
he bellowed, "Sir Richard of Maybury. With this knife I do give to you the freedom of 
the Underside. May you be allowed to walk freely, without let or hindrance . . . and so 
on and so forth . . . et cetera . . . blah blah blah," he trailed of vaguely. 

"Thanks," said Richard. "It's Mayhew, actually." But the train was coming to a 
stop. 
"This is where you get off," said the earl. He gave Richard his knife—Hunter's 
knife—once more, patted him on the back, and pointed toward the door. 
  
The place that Richard got off was not an Underground station. It was above 
ground, and it reminded Richard a little of St. Pancras Station—there was something 
similarly oversized and mock-Gothic about the architecture. But there was also a 
wrongness that somehow marked it as part of London Below. The light was that 
strange, strained gray one only sees shortly before dawn and for a few moments after 
sunset, the times when the world washes out into gloom, and color and distance become 
impossible to judge. 
There was a man sitting on a wooden bench, watching him; and Richard 
approached him, cautiously, unable to tell, in the gloaming, who the man was, whether 
it was someone he had met before. Richard was still holding Hunter's knife—his 
knife— and now he gripped the hilt more tightly, for reassurance. The man looked up 
as Richard approached, and he sprang to his feet. He tugged at his forelock, something 
Richard had previously only seen done on television adaptations of classic novels. He 
looked both comical and unpleasant. Richard recognized the man as the Lord Rat-
speaker. 
"Well-well. Yes-yes," said the rat-speaker, agitatedly, beginning in mid-sentence, 
"Just to say, the girl Anaesthesia. No hard feelings. The rats are your friends, still. And 
the rat-speakers. You come to us. We'll do you all right." 
"Thanks," said Richard. Anaesthesia will take him, he thought. She's expendable. 
The Lord Rat-speaker fumbled on the bench, and presented Richard with a black 
vinyl zip-up sports bag. It was extremely familiar. "It's all there. Everything. Take a 
look." Richard opened the bag. All his possessions were in there, including, on top of 
some neatly folded jeans, his wallet. He zipped the bag up, threw it over his shoulder, 
and walked away from the man, without a thank-you or a backward glance. 
Richard walked out of the station and down some gray stone steps. All was silent. 
All was empty. Dead autumn leaves blew across an open court, a flurry of yellow and 
ochre and brown, a sudden burst of muted color in the dim light. Richard crossed the 
court and walked down some steps into an underpass. There was a fluttering in the half-
dark, and, warily, he turned. There were about a dozen of them, in the corridor behind 
him, and they slipped toward him almost silently, just a rustle of dark velvet, and, here 
and there, the clink of silver jewelery. The rustle of the leaves had been so much louder 
than these pale women. They watched him with hungry eyes. 
He was scared, then. He had the knife, true, but he could no more fight with it than 
he could jump across the Thames. He hoped that, if they attacked, he might be able to 
scare them away with it. He could smell honeysuckle, and lily of the valley, and musk. 
Lamia edged her way to the front of the Velvets, and stepped forward. Richard 
raised the knife, nervously, remembering the chilly passion of her embrace, how 
pleasant it was and how cold. She smiled at him, and inclined her head, sweetly. Then 
she kissed her fingertips, and blew the kiss toward Richard. 

He shivered. Something fluttered in the darkness of the underpass; and when he 
looked again, there was nothing but shadows. 
  
Through the underpass, and Richard walked up some steps, and found himself at 
the top of a small grassy hill. It was dawn, and he could just make out details of the 
countryside around him: almost leafless oak, and ash, and beech trees, readily 
identifiable by the shapes of their trunks. A wide, clean river meandered gently through 
the green countryside. As he looked around, he realized that he was on an island of 
some kind—two smaller rivers ran into the larger one, cutting him off on his little hill, 
from the mainland. He knew then, without knowing how, but with total certainty, that 
he was still in London, but London as it had been perhaps three thousand years ago, or 
more, before ever the first stone of the first human habitation was laid upon a stone. 
He unzipped his bag and put the knife away in it, beside his wallet. Then he zipped 
it up again. The sky was starting to lighten, but the light was odd. It was younger, 
somehow, than the sunlight he was familiar with—purer, perhaps. An orange-red sun 
rose in the east, where Docklands would one day be, and Richard watched the dawn 
breaking over forests and marshes that he kept thinking of as Greenwich and Kent and 
the sea. 
"Hello," said Door. He had not seen her approach. She was wearing different 
clothes beneath her battered brown leather jacket: they were still layered and ripped and 
patched, though, in taffeta and lace and silk and brocade. Her short red hair shone in the 
dawn like burnished copper. 
"Hello," said Richard. She stood beside him and twined her small fingers into his 
right hand, the hand that was holding the sports bag. "Where are we?" he asked. 
"On the awesome and terrible island of Westminster," she told him. It sounded as 
if she were quoting from somewhere, but he did not believe he had ever heard that 
phrase before. They began to walk together over the long grass, wet and white with 
melting frost. Their footprints left a dark green trail in the grass behind them, showing 
where they had come from. 
"Look," said Door. "With the angel gone, there's a lot of sorting out to do in 
London Below. And there's only me to do it. My father wanted to unite London Below 
. . . I suppose I ought to try to finish what he started." They were walking north, away 
from the Thames, hand in hand. White seagulls wheeled and called in the sky above 
them. "Richard, you heard what Islington said to us about keeping my sister alive, just 
in case. I may not be the only one of my family left. And you've saved my life. More 
than once." She paused, and then, all in a rush, blurted, "You've been a really good 
friend to me, Richard. And I've sort of got to like having you around. Please don't go." 
He squeezed her hand in his, gently. "Well," he said, "I've sort of got to like 
having you around, too. But I don't belong in this world. In my London . . . well, the 
most dangerous thing you ever have to watch out for is a taxi in a bit of a hurry. I like 
you, too. I like you an awful lot. But I have to go home." 
She looked up at him with her odd-colored eyes, green and blue and flame. "Then 
we won't ever see each other again," she said. 
"I suppose we won't." 

"Thanks for everything you did," she said, seriously. Then she threw her arms 
around him, and she squeezed him tightly enough that the bruises on his ribs hurt, and 
he hugged her back, just as tightly, making all of his bruises complain violently, and he 
simply didn't care. 
"Well," he said, eventually. "It was very nice knowing you." She was blinking 
hard. He wondered if she were going to tell him again that she had something in her 
eye. Instead she said, "Are you ready?" 
He nodded. 
"Have you got the key?" 
He put down his bag and rummaged in his back pocket with his good hand. He 
took out the key and handed it to her. She held it out in front of her, as if it were being 
inserted in an imaginary door. "Okay," she said. "Just walk. Don't look back." 
He began walking down a small hill, away from the blue waters of the Thames. A 
gray gull swooped past. At the bottom of the hill, he looked back. She stood at the top 
of the hill, silhouetted by the rising sun. Her cheeks were glistening. The orange 
sunlight gleamed on the key. Door turned it, with one decisive motion. 
  
The world went dark, and a low roar filled Richard's head, like the maddened 
growling of a thousand enraged beasts. 

TWENTY 
The world went dark, and a low roar filled Richard's head, like the maddened growling 
of a thousand enraged beasts. He blinked at the darkness, held tight to his bag. He 
wondered if he had been foolish, putting the knife away. Some people brushed past him 
in the dark. Richard started away from them. There were steps in front of him; Richard 
began to ascend, and, as he did so, the world began to resolve, to take shape and to re-
form. 
The growling was the roar of traffic, and he was coming out of an underpass in 
Trafalgar Square. The sky was the perfect untroubled blue of a television screen, tuned 
to a dead channel. 
It was midmorning, on a warm October day, and he stood in the square holding his 
bag and blinking at the sunlight. Black taxis and red buses and multicolored cars roared 
and careened about the square, while tourists threw handfuls of pigeon feed down for 
the legions of tubby pigeons and took their snapshots of Nelson's Column and the huge 
Landseer lions that flanked it. He walked through the square, wondering if he was real 
or not. The Japanese tourists ignored him. He tried talking to a pretty fairhaired girl, 
who laughed, and shook her head, and said something in a language Richard thought 
might have been Italian, but was actually Finnish. 
There was a small child of indeterminate sex, staring at some pigeons while orally 
demolishing a chocolate bar. He crouched down next to it. "Ur Hello, kiddie," said 
Richard. The child sucked its chocolate bar intently and gave no indication of 
recognizing Richard as another human being. "Hello," repeated Richard, a slight note of 
desperation creeping into his voice. "Can you see me? Kiddie? Hello? Two small eyes 
glared at him from a chocolate covered face. And then its lower lip began to tremble, 
and the child fled, throwing its arms around the legs of the nearest adult female, and 
wailing "Mommy? This man's bothering me. He's bothering me." 
The child's mother turned on Richard with a formidable scowl. "What are you 
doing," she demanded, "bothering our Leslie? There are places for people like you." 
Richard began to smile. It was a huge and happy smile. "I really am most 
frightfully sorry," he said, grinning like a Cheshire cat. And then, clutching his bag, he 
ran through Trafalgar Square, accompanied by bursts of sudden pigeons, who took to 
the air in astonishment. 
  
He took his cashcard out of his wallet, and he put it into the cash machine. It 
recognized his four-digit pin number, advised him to keep it a secret and not disclose it 
to anyone, and asked what kind of service he would like. He asked for cash, and it gave 
him cash in abundance. He punched the air in delight, and then, embarrassed, pretended 
that he had been hailing a cab. 
A cab stopped for him—it stopped!—for him!—and he climbed in, and sat in the 
back, and beamed. He asked the driver to take him to his office. And when the cab 
driver pointed out that it would almost be quicker to walk, Richard grinned even wider, 
and said he did not care. And as soon as they were underway he asked—practically 

begged—the cab driver to regale him, Richard, with his opinions on Inner-City Traffic 
Problems, How Best to Deal with Crime, and Thorny Political Issues of the Day. The 
cab driver accused Richard of "taking the Mickey," and sulked for all of the five-minute 
journey up the Strand. Richard did not care. He tipped the man ridiculously anyway. 
And then he walked into his office. 
As he entered the building, he felt the smile begin to leave his face. Each step he 
took left him more anxious, more uneasy. What if he still had no job? What did it 
matter if small, chocolate-covered children and cab drivers could see him, if it turned 
out that, by some appalling mischance, he remained invisible to his colleagues? 
Mr. Figgis, the security guard, looked up from a copy of Naughty Teenage 
Nymphets, which he had hidden inside his copy of the Sun, and he sniffed. "Morning 
Mister Mayhew," he said. It was not a welcoming "morning." It was the kind of 
"morning" that implied that the speaker really did not care if the recipient lived or 
died—nor indeed, for that matter, if it was even morning. 
"Figgis!" exclaimed Richard, in delight. "And hello to you too, Mister Figgis, you 
exceptional security guard!" 
Nobody had ever said anything remotely like that to Mr. Figgis before, not even 
naked ladies in his imagination; Figgis stared suspiciously at Richard until he got into 
the elevator and vanished from sight, then he returned his attention to the naughty 
teenage nymphets, none of whom, he was beginning to suspect, was ever likely to see 
twenty-nine again, lollipops or no lollipops. 
Richard got out of the elevator and walked, slightly hesitantly, down the corridor. 
Everything will be all right, he told himself, if only my desk is there. If my desk is there, 
everything will be fine. He walked into the large room full of cubicles he had worked in 
for three years. People were working at desks, talking on telephones, rummaging 
through filing cabinets, drinking bad tea and worse coffee. It was his office. And there 
was the place by the window, where his desk had once been, which was now occupied 
by a gray cluster of filing cabinets and a yucca plant. He was about to turn and run 
when someone handed him a cup of tea in a Styrofoam cup. 
"The return of the prodigal, eh?" said Gary. "Here you go." 
"Hello Gary," said Richard. "Where's my desk?" 
"This way," said Gary. "How was Majorca?" 
"Majorca?" 
"Don't you always go to Majorca?" asked Gary. They were walking up the back 
stairs that led to the fourth floor. 
"Not this time," said Richard. 
"I was going to say," said Gary. "Not much of a tan." 
"No," agreed Richard. "Well. You know. I needed a change." 
Gary nodded. He pointed to a door that had, for as long as Richard had been there, 
been the door to the executive files and supplies room. "A change? Well, you've 
certainly got one now. And may I be the first to congratulate you?" The plaque on the 
door said: 

R. B. MAYHEW 
JUNIOR PARTNER 
"Lucky bastard," said Gary, affectionately. 
He wandered off, and Richard went through the door, utterly bemused. The room 
was no longer an executive supplies and file room: it had been emptied of files and 
supplies, and painted in gray and black and white, and recarpeted. In the center of the 
office was a large desk. He examined it: it was, unmistakably, his very own desk. His 
trolls had all been neatly put away in one of the desk drawers, and he took them all out, 
and arranged them around the office. He had his own window, with a nice view of the 
sludge-brown river and the South Bank of the Thames, beyond. There was even a large 
green plant, with huge waxy leaves, of the kind that looks artificial but isn't. His old, 
dusty, cream-colored computer terminal had been replaced with a much sleeker, cleaner 
black computer terminal, which took up less desk space. 
He walked over to the window and sipped his tea, staring out at the dirty brown 
river. 
"You've found everything all right, then?" He looked up. Crisp, and efficient, 
Sylvia, the MD's PA, was standing in the doorway. She smiled when she saw him. 
"Um. Yes. Look, there are things I have to take care of at home . . . d'you think it'd 
be all right if I took the rest of the day off and—" 
"Suit yourself. You aren't meant to be back in till tomorrow anyway." 
"I'm not?" he asked. "Right." 
Sylvia frowned. "What happened to your finger?" 
"I broke it," he told her. 
She looked at his hand with concern. "You weren't in a fight, were you?" 
"Me?" 
She grinned. "Just teasing. I suppose you shut it in a door. That's what my sister 
did." 
"No," Richard began to admit, "I was in a fi . . . " Sylvia raised an eyebrow. "A 
door," he finished lamely. 
He went to the building he had once lived in by taxi. He was not sure that he 
trusted himself to travel by the Underground. Not yet. Having no door key, he knocked 
at the door of his flat and was more than disappointed when it was opened by the 
woman Richard last remembered meeting, or rather, failing to meet, in his bathroom. 
He introduced himself as the previous tenant, and quickly established that a) he, 
Richard, no longer lived there, and b) she, Mrs. Buchanan, had no idea what had 
happened to any of his personal possessions. Richard took some notes, and then he said 
good-bye very nicely, and took another black taxi to go and see a man in a camel-hair 
coat. 
The smooth man in the camel-hair coat was not wearing his camel-hair coat, and 
was, in fact, a good deal less smooth than the last time Richard had encountered him. 
They were sitting in his office, and he had listened to Richard's list of complaints with 
the expression of someone who has recently and accidentally swallowed whole a live 
spider and has just begun to feel it squirm. 

"Well, yes," he admitted, after looking at the files. "There does seem to have been 
some kind of problem, now you mention it. I can't quite see how it could have 
happened." 
"I don't think it matters how it happened," said Richard, reasonably. "The fact of 
the matter is that while I was away for a few weeks, you rented my apartment to," he 
consulted his notes, "George and Adele Buchanan. Who have no intention of leaving." 
The man closed the file. "Well," he said. "Mistakes do happen. Human error. I'm 
afraid there's nothing we can do about it." 
The old Richard, the one who had lived in what was now the Buchanans' home, 
would have crumbled at this point, apologized for being a nuisance, and gone away. 
Instead, Richard said, "Really? Nothing you can do about it? You rented a property I 
was legally renting from your company to someone else, and in the process lost all my 
personal possessions, and there's nothing you can do about it? Now, I happen to think, 
and I'm sure my lawyer will also think, that there is a great deal you can do about it." 
The man without the camel-hair coat looked as if the spider was beginning to 
crawl back up his throat. "But we don't have any other vacant apartments like yours in 
the building," he said. "There's only the penthouse suite." 
"That," Richard told the man, coldly, "would be fine . . . " The man relaxed. " . . . 
for living accommodation. Now," said Richard, "let's talk about compensation for my 
lost possessions." 
  
The new apartment was much nicer than the one he had left behind. It had more 
windows, and a balcony, a spacious lounge, and a proper spare bedroom. Richard 
prowled it, dissatisfied. The man-without-a-camel-hair-coat had, extremely grudgingly, 
had the apartment furnished with a bed, a sofa, several chairs, and a television set. 
Richard put Hunter's knife on the mantelpiece. He bought a take-away curry from the 
Indian restaurant across the road, sat on the carpeted floor of his new apartment, and ate 
it, wondering if he had ever really eaten curry late at night in a street-market held on the 
deck of a gunship moored by Tower Bridge. It did not seem very likely, now that he 
thought about it. 
The doorbell rang. He got up and answered the door. "We found a lot of your 
stuff, Mr. Mayhew," said the man who was once more wearing his camel-hair coat. 
"Turned out it'd been put into storage. Right, bring the stuff in, lads." 
A couple of burly men hauled in several large wooden packing cases, filled with 
Richard's stuff, and deposited them on the carpet in the middle of the living room. 
"Thanks," said Richard. He reached into the first box, unwrapped the first paper-
covered object, which turned out to be a framed photograph of Jessica. He stared at it 
for some moments, and then he put it down again in the case. He found the box with his 
clothes in it, removed them, and put them away in his bedroom, but the other boxes sat, 
untouched, in the middle of the living room floor. As the days went on, he felt 
increasingly guilty about not unpacking them. But he did not unpack them. 
  

He was in his office, sitting at his desk, staring out of the window, when the 
intercom buzzed. "Richard?" said Sylvia. "The MD wants a meeting in his office in 
twenty minutes to discuss the Wandsworth report." 
"I'll be there," he said. Then, because he had nothing else to do for the next ten 
minutes, he picked up an orange troll and menaced a slightly smaller green-haired troll 
with it. "I am the greatest warrior of London Below. Prepare to die," he said, in a 
dangerous trollish voice, waggling the orange troll. Then he picked up the green-haired 
troll, and said, in a smaller trollish voice, "Aha! But first you shall drink the nice cup of 
tea . . . " 
Someone knocked on the door, and, guiltily, he put down the trolls. "Come in." 
The door opened, and Jessica came in, and stood in the doorway. She looked nervous. 
He had forgotten quite how beautiful she was. "Hello Richard," she said. 
"Hello Jess," said Richard, and then he corrected himself. "Sorry—Jessica." 
She smiled, and tossed her hair. "Oh, Jess is fine," she said, and looked as if she 
almost meant it. "Jessica—Jess. Nobody's called me Jess for ages. I rather miss it." 
"So," said Richard, "what brings, do I have the honor, you, um." 
"Just wanted to see you, really." 
He was not sure what he ought to say. "That's nice," he said. 
She closed the door to his office and took a few steps toward him. "Richard. You 
know something strange? I remember calling the engagement off. But I hardly 
remember what we were arguing about." 
"No?" 
"It's not important, though. Is it?" She looked around the office. "You got a 
promotion?" 
"Yes." 
"I'm happy for you." She put a hand into the pocket of her coat and pulled out a 
small brown box. She put it down on Richard's desk. He opened the box, although he 
knew what was inside it. "It's our engagement ring. I thought that, well, maybe, I'd give 
it back to you, and then, well, if things worked out, well, perhaps one day you'd give it 
back to me." It glittered in the sunlight: the most money he had ever spent on anything. 
He closed the box, and gave it back to her. "You keep it, Jessica," he said. And then, 
"I'm sorry." 
She bit her lower lip. "Did you meet someone?" He hesitated. He thought of 
Lamia, and Hunter, and Anaesthesia, and even Door, but none of them were someones 
in the way that she meant. "No. No one else," he said. And then, realizing it was true as 
he said it, "I've just changed, that's all." 
His intercom buzzed. "Richard? We're waiting for you." He pressed the button. 
"Be right down, Sylvia." 
He looked at Jessica. She said nothing. Perhaps there was nothing she could trust 
herself to say. She walked away, and she closed the door quietly behind her. 
Richard picked up the papers he would need, with one hand. He ran the other hand 
across his face, as if he were wiping something away: sorrow, perhaps, or tears, or 
Jessica. 

  
He started taking the Tube again, to and from work, although he soon found that 
he had stopped buying newspapers to read on his journey in the morning and the 
evening, and instead of reading he would scan the faces of the other people on the train, 
faces of every kind and color, and wonder if they were all from London Above, wonder 
what went on behind their eyes. 
During the evening rush hour, a few days after his encounter with Jessica, he 
thought he saw Lamia across the carriage, with her back to him, her dark hair piled high 
on her head and her dress long and black. His heart began to pound in his chest. He 
pushed his way toward her through the crowded compartment. As he got closer, the 
train pulled into a station, the doors hissed open, and she stepped off. But it was not 
Lamia. Just another young London goth-girl, he realized, disappointed, off for a night 
on the town. 
  
One Saturday afternoon he saw a large brown rat, sitting on top of the plastic 
garbage cans at the back of Newton Mansions, cleaning its whiskers and looking as if it 
owned the world. At Richard's approach it leapt down onto the pavement and waited in 
the shadow of the garbage cans, staring up at him with wary bead-black eyes. 
Richard crouched down. "Hello," he said, gently. "Do we know each other?" The 
rat made no kind of response that Richard was able to perceive, but it did not run away. 
"My name is Richard Mayhew," he continued, in a low voice. "I'm not actually a rat-
speaker, but I, um, know a few rats, well, I've met some, and I wondered if you were 
familiar with the Lady Door" 
He heard a shoe scrape behind him, and he turned to see the Buchanans looking at 
him curiously. "Have you . . . lost something?" asked Mrs. Buchanan. Richard heard, 
but ignored, her husband's gruff whisper of "Just his marbles." 
"No," said Richard, honestly, "I was, um, saying hello to a . . . " The rat scurried 
off and away. 
"Was that a rat?" barked George Buchanan. "I'll complain to the council. It's a 
disgrace. But that's London for you, isn't it?" 
Yes, agreed Richard. It was. It really was. 
  
Richard's possessions continued to sit untouched in the wooden packing cases in 
the middle of the living room floor. 
He had not yet turned on the television. He would come home at night, and eat, 
then he would stand at the window, looking out over London, at the cars and the 
rooftops and the lights, as the late autumn twilight turned into night, and the lights came 
on all over the city. He would watch, standing alone in his darkened flat, until the city's 
lights began to be turned off. Eventually, reluctantly, he would undress, and climb into 
bed, and go to sleep. 
Sylvia came into his office one Friday afternoon. He was opening envelopes, using 
his knife—Hunter's knife—as a letter-opener. "Richard?" she said. "I was wondering. 
Are you getting out much, these days?" He shook his head. "Well, a bunch of us are 
going out this evening. Do you fancy coming along?" 

"Um. Sure," he said. "Yes. I'd love it." 
He hated it. 
There were eight of them: Sylvia and her young man, who had something to do 
with vintage cars, Gary from Corporate Accounts, who had recently broken up with his 
girlfriend, due to what Gary persisted in describing as a slight misunderstanding (he 
had thought she would be rather more understanding about his sleeping with her best 
friend than she had in fact turned out to be), several perfectly nice people and friends of 
nice people, and the new girl from Computer Services. 
First they saw a film on the huge screen of the Odeon, Leicester Square. The good 
guy won in the end, and there were plenty of explosions and flying objects on the way. 
Sylvia decided that Richard should sit next to the girl from Computer Services, as, she 
explained, she was new to the company and did not know many people. 
They walked down to Old Compton Street, on the edge of Soho, where the tawdry 
and the chic sit side by side to the benefit of both, and they ate at La Reache, filling up 
on couscous and dozens of marvelous plates of exotic food, which covered their table 
and spilled over onto an unused table nearby, and they walked from there to a small pub 
Sylvia liked in nearby Berwick Street, and they had a few drinks, and they chatted. 
The new girl from Computer Services smiled at Richard a lot, as the evening went 
on, and he had nothing at all to say to her. He bought a round of drinks for the party, 
and the girl from Computer Services helped him carry them from the bar back to their 
table. Gary went off to the men's room, and the girl from Computer Services came and 
sat next to Richard, taking his place. Richard's head was filled with the clink of glasses, 
and the blare of the jukebox, and the sharp smell of beer and spilt Bacardi and cigarette 
smoke. He tried to listen to the conversations going on at the table, and he found that he 
could no longer concentrate on what anyone was saying, and, which was worse, that he 
was not interested in any of what he was able to hear. 
And it came to him then, as clearly and as certainly as if he had been watching it 
on the big screen at the Odeon, Leicester Square: the rest of his life. He would go home 
tonight with the girl from Computer Services, and they would make gentle love, and 
tomorrow, it being Saturday, they would spend the morning in bed. And then they 
would get up, and together they would remove his possessions from the packing cases, 
and put them away. In a year, or a little less, he would marry the girl from Computer 
Services, and get another promotion, and they would have two children, a boy and a 
girl, and they would move out to the suburbs, to Harrow or Croydon or Hampstead or 
even as far away as distant Reading. 
And it would not be a bad life. He knew that, too. Sometimes there is nothing you 
can do. 
When Gary came back from the toilet, he looked around in puzzlement. Everyone 
was there except . . . "Dick?" he asked "Has anyone seen Richard?" 
The girl from Computer Services shrugged. 
  
Gary went outside, to Berwick Street. The cold of the night air was like a splash of 
water to his face. He could taste winter in the air. He called, "Dick? Hey? Richard?" 
"Over here." 

Richard was leaning against a wall, in the shadows. "Just getting a breath of fresh 
air." 
"Are you all right?" asked Gary. 
"Yes," said Richard. "No. I don't know." 
"Well," said Gary, "that covers your options. Do you want to talk about it?" 
Richard looked at him seriously. "You'll laugh at me." 
"I'll do that anyway." 
Richard looked at Gary. Then Gary was relieved to see him smile, and he knew 
that they were still friends. Gary looked back at the pub. Then he put his hands into his 
coat pockets. "Come on," he said. "Let's walk. You can get it off your chest. Then I'll 
laugh at you." 
"Bastard," said Richard, sounding a lot more like Richard than he had in recent 
weeks. 
"It's what friends are for." 
They began to amble off, under the streetlights. "Look, Gary," Richard began. "Do 
you ever wonder if this is all there is?" 
"What?" 
Richard gestured vaguely, taking in everything. "Work. Home. The pub. Meeting 
girls. Living in the city. Life. Is that all there is?" 
"I think that sums it up, yes," said Gary. 
Richard sighed. "Well," he said, "for a start, I didn't go to Majorca. I mean, I really 
didn't go to Majorca." 
  
Richard talked as they walked up and down the warren of tiny Soho back streets 
between Regent Street and the Charing Cross Road. He talked, and talked, beginning 
with finding a girl bleeding on the pavement, and trying to help, because he couldn't 
just leave her there, and what happened next. And when they got too cold to walk they 
went into an all-night greasy spoon cafe. It was a proper one, the kind that cooked 
everything in lard, and served cups of serious tea in large chipped white mugs shiny 
with bacon grease. Richard and Gary sat and Richard talked while Gary listened, and 
then they ordered fried eggs and baked beans and toast and sat and ate them, while 
Richard continued to talk, and Gary continued to listen. They mopped up the last of 
their egg yolks with the toast. They drank more tea, until eventually Richard said, " . . . 
and then Door did something with the key, and I was back again. In London Above. 
Well, the real London. And, well, you know the rest." 
There was a silence. "That's all," said Richard. He finished his tea. 
Gary scratched his head. "Look," he said, at length. "Is this real? Not some kind of 
horrible joke? I mean, somebody with a camera isn't about to leap out from behind a 
screen or something and tell me I'm on Candid Camera?" 
"I sincerely hope not," said Richard. "You . . . do you believe me?" 
Gary looked at the bill on their table, counted out pound coins, and dropped them 
onto the Formica, where they sat beside a plastic tomato ketchup container in the shape 

of an oversized tomato, old ketchup caked black about its nozzle. "I believe that, well, 
something happened to you, obviously . . . Look, more to the point, do you believe it?" 
Richard stared up at him. There were dark circles beneath Richard's eyes. "Do I 
believe it? I don't know anymore. I did. I was there. There was a part in there when you 
turned up, you know." 
"You didn't mention that before." 
"It was a pretty horrid part. You told me that I'd gone mad and I was just 
wandering around London hallucinating." 
They walked out of the cafe and walked south, toward Piccadilly. "Well," said 
Gary, "you must admit, it sounds more likely than your magical London underneath, 
where the people who fall through the cracks go. I've passed the people who fall 
through the cracks, Richard: they sleep in shop doorways all down the Strand. They 
don't go to a special London. They freeze to death in the winter." 
Richard said nothing. 
Gary continued. "I think maybe you got some kind of blow on the head. Or maybe 
some kind of shock when Jessica chucked you. For a while you went a little crazy. 
Then you got better." 
Richard shivered. "You know what scares me? I think you could be right." 
"So life isn't exciting?" continued Gary. "Great. Give me boredom. At least I know 
where I'm going to eat and sleep tonight. I'll still have a job on Monday. Yeah?" He 
turned and looked at Richard. 
Richard nodded, hesitantly. "Yeah." 
Gary looked at his watch. "Bloody hell," he exclaimed. "It's after two o'clock. Let's 
hope there are still a few taxis about." They walked into Brewer Street, at the Piccadilly 
end of Soho, wandering past the lights of the peep shows and the strip clubs. Gary was 
talking about taxis. He was not saying anything original, or even interesting. He was 
simply fulfilling his obligation as a Londoner to grumble about taxis. " . . . Had his light 
on and everything," he was saying, "I told him where I wanted to go, he said, sorry, I'm 
on my way home, I said, where do all you taxi drivers live anyway? And why don't any 
of you live near me? The trick is to get in first, then tell them you live south of the 
river, I mean, what was he trying to tell me? The way he was carrying on, Battersea 
might as well have been in bloody Katmandu . . . " 
Richard had tuned him out. When they reached Windmill Street, Richard crossed 
the road and stared into the window of the Vintage Magazine Shop, examining the 
cartoonish models of forgotten film stars and the old posters and comics and magazines 
on display. It had been a glimpse into a world of adventure and imagination. And it was 
not true. He told himself that. 
"So, what do you think?" Gary asked. 
Richard jerked back to the present. "Of what?" 
Gary realized Richard had not heard a word he had said. He said it again. "If there 
aren't any taxis we could get night buses." 
"Yeah," said Richard. "Great. Fine." 
Gary grimaced. "You worry me." 

"Sorry." 
They walked down Windmill Street, toward Piccadilly. Richard thrust his hands 
deep into his pockets. He looked puzzled for a moment, and pulled out a rather 
crumpled black crow's feather, with red thread tied around the quill. 
"What's that?" asked Gary. 
"It's a—" He stopped. "It's just a feather. You're right. It's only rubbish." He 
dropped the feather in the gutter at the curb, and did not look back. 
Gary hesitated. Then he said, picking his words with care, "Have you thought 
about seeing somebody?" 
"See somebody? Look, I'm not crazy, Gary." 
"Are you sure about that?" A taxi came toward them, yellow for-hire light burning. 
"No," said Richard, honestly. "Here's a taxi. You take it. I'll take the next one." 
"Thanks." Gary waved down the taxi and climbed into the back before telling the 
driver that he wished to go to Battersea. He pulled down the window, and, as the taxi 
pulled out, he said, "Richard—this is reality. Get used to it. It's all there is. See you on 
Monday." 
Richard waved at him and watched the taxi drive away. Then he turned around and 
walked slowly away from the lights of Piccadilly, back up toward Brewer Street. There 
was no longer a feather by the curb. Richard paused beside an old woman, fast asleep in 
a shop doorway. She was covered with a ripped old blanket, and her few possessions—
two small junk-filled cardboard boxes and a dirty, once-white umbrella—were tied 
together with string beside her, and the string was tied around her wrist, to keep anyone 
from stealing them while she slept. She wore a wool hat, of no particular color. 
He pulled out his wallet, found a ten-pound note, and bent down to slide the folded 
note into the woman's hand. Her eyes opened, and she jerked awake. She blinked at the 
money with old eyes. "What's this?" she said, sleepily, displeased at having been 
woken. "Keep it," said Richard. 
She unfolded the money, then pushed it up her sleeve. "Whatchyouwant?" she 
asked Richard, suspiciously. 
"Nothing," said Richard. "I really don't want anything. Nothing at all." And then 
he realized how true that was; and how dreadful a thing it had become. "Have you ever 
got everything you ever wanted? And then realized it wasn't what you wanted at all?" 
"Can't say that I have," she said, picking the sleep from the corner of her eyes. 
"I thought I wanted this," said Richard. "I thought I wanted a nice, normal life. I 
mean, maybe I am crazy. I mean, maybe. But if this is all there is, then I don't want to 
be sane. You know?" She shook her head. He reached into his inside pocket. "You see 
this?" he said. He held up the knife. "Hunter gave this to me as she died," he told her. 
"Don't hurt me," said the old lady. "I ain't done nuffing." 
He heard a strange intensity in his own voice. "I wiped her blood from the blade. 
A hunter looks after her weapons. The earl knighted me with it. He gave me the 
freedom of the Underside." 
"I don't know anyfing about that," she said. "Please. Put it away. That's a good 
lad." 

Richard hefted the knife. Then he lunged toward the brick wall, next to the 
doorway in which the woman had been sleeping. He slashed three times, once 
horizontally, twice vertically. "What you doin'?" asked the woman, warily. 
"Making a door," he told her. 
She sniffed. "You ought to put that thing away. If the police see you they'll run 
you in for offensive weapons." 
Richard looked at the outline of a doorway he had scratched on the wall. He put 
his knife back into his pocket, and he began to hammer on the wall with his fists. "Hey! 
Is there anyone there? Can you hear me? It's me—Richard. Door? Someone?" He hurt 
his hands, but he kept banging and flailing at the brickwork. 
And then the madness left him, and he stopped. 
"Sorry," he said to the old lady. 
She did not answer. She had either gone back to sleep or, more probably, 
pretended to go back to sleep. Elderly snores, real or feigned, came from the doorway. 
Richard sat down on the pavement, and wondered how someone could make such a 
mess of their life as he had made of his. Then he looked back at the doorway he had 
scratched on the wall. 
There was a door-shaped hole in the wall, where he had scratched his outline. 
There was a man standing in the doorway, with his arms folded theatrically. He stood 
there until he was certain that Richard had seen him. And then he yawned hugely, 
covering his mouth with a dark hand. 
The marquis de Carabas raised an eyebrow. "Well?" he said, irritably. "Are you 
coming?" 
Richard stared at him for a heartbeat. 
Then Richard nodded, without trusting himself to speak, and stood up. And they 
walked away together through the hole in the wall, back into the darkness, leaving 
nothing behind them; not even the doorway.
