Author’s Acknowledgments
I love teaching Web design because it’s so much fun to see what everyone 
creates on the Internet. Most of all, I want to thank all the people who have 
read my books or watched my videos over the years and gone on to create 
Web sites. You are my greatest inspiration. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thanks to my love, David LaFontaine, whose patience and support have kept 
me fed, loved, and entertained. You are the greatest researcher I’ve ever 
known and a constant source of inspiration.
Thanks to photographers and Web designers Mariana Davi Cheng (DaviDesign.
com), Jasper Johal (Jasper-Art.com), Pamela Kerr (LouiseGreen.com), Anissa 
Thompson (Anissat.com), and Stephanie Kjos Warner who designed many of 
the Web sites and took the photographs featured in the examples in this book. 
Thanks to the entire editorial team: Mark Justice Hinton for his superb tech 
editing; Becky Huehls for catching the details and improving the prose; and 
Bob Woerner for shepherding this book through the development and pub-
lishing process.
Over the years, I’ve thanked many people in my books — family, friends, 
teachers, and mentors — but I have been graced by so many wonderful peo-
ple now that no publisher will give me enough pages to thank them all. So let 
me conclude by thanking everyone who has ever helped me with a Web site, 
a book, or any other aspect of writing and Internet research, just so I can go 
to sleep tonight and know I haven’t forgotten anyone.

Introduction
I
n the ten-plus years that I’ve been writing about Web design, I’ve seen 
many changes — from the early days (before Dreamweaver even existed) 
when you could create only simple pages with HTML 1.0, to the elaborate 
designs you can create with Dreamweaver today using XHTML, CSS, AJAX, 
multimedia, and more.
If you’re not sure what those acronyms mean yet, don’t worry. I remember 
what it was like to figure out all this stuff, too, so I designed this book to 
introduce you to the basic concepts. I also want to prepare you for the 
ever-changing world of Web design, so I show you how to use Dreamweaver 
to create Web sites that take advantage of the latest advances in Web tech-
nologies, such as CSS and AJAX.
One of the challenges of Web design today is that Web pages are not only 
being displayed on different kinds of computers, but are also being down-
loaded to computers with monitors that are as big as widescreen televisions 
and as small as cell phones. As a result, creating Web sites that look good 
to all visitors is a lot more complex than it used to be, and standards have 
become a lot more important. That’s why in this book, you find out not only 
how to use all the great features in Dreamweaver but also how to determine

Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies 
What’s New in Dreamweaver CS4?
Dreamweaver’s high-end features make it the preferred choice for profes-
sional Web designers, and its easy-to-use graphical interface makes it popular 
among novices and hobbyists as well. With each new version, Dreamweaver’s 
become more powerful and feature-rich, but this upgrade is arguably the 
most dramatic, with the following new features:
 
 Gray interface: The first change you notice when you launch 
Dreamweaver CS4 is that it’s all shades of gray. This change to the 
interface wasn’t intended to make the program look dull — it’s designed 
to help you work better with color in your own designs. If you miss 
all the colorful icons, don’t fret. When you roll your cursor over the 
icons, their colorful designs reappear, making it easier to recognize 
and select them.
 
 Customizable interface: Dreamweaver now comes with more preset 
layout options. Dreamweaver CS3 offered three choices, but when you 
choose Workspace➪Layout in CS4, you find eight preset layout options, 
each optimized for a specific profile, including Designer, Coder, and 
Programmer. If you miss the Insert panel being positioned at the top 
of the screen instead of at the top right where it’s positioned in CS4, 
choose Classic from the Layout menu to get your old favorite back. All 
the panels, palettes, and toolbars can be repositioned on the screen 
with click-and-drag ease, and you can save multiple layout options by 
choosing Workspace➪Layout➪Manage Workspaces.
 
 Enhanced CSS support: Among the most dramatic (and welcome!) 
changes to Dreamweaver CS4 are better CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
support and a new host of CSS features. Creating and editing styles 
is now better integrated throughout Dreamweaver, especially in the 
Property inspector. Creating Web sites with CSS is by far the best option 
today. That’s why so many of the improvements to Dreamweaver are 
related to CSS, and why I’ve dedicated more of this book than ever to 
the best strategies for creating styles and CSS layouts. Chapters 5 and 6 
explain what you need to know in detail.
 
 Property inspector: The Property inspector has been split in two 
in Dreamweaver CS4 to better separate HTML (HyperText Markup 
Language) options from CSS. You can also create and edit styles as you 
specify settings in the Property inspector — a welcome addition that 
makes working with styles much faster and more intuitive (after you get 
the hang of it). See Chapter 5 for more.
 
 Better integration with Photoshop, Flash, and other design programs: 
Some of the coolest improvements to Dreamweaver CS4 include greater 
integration among Adobe’s suite of programs. If you’re a former GoLive 
user, you’ll be pleased to find that Adobe added Smart Objects to CS4 (the 
lack of this feature was a big complaint among former GoLive users who 
tried Dreamweaver CS3). Smart Objects makes it possible to drag and 

3
 Introduction
drop a Photoshop (PSD) file into a Web page in Dreamweaver and then 
use the Image Preview dialog box to optimize and resize the PSD file on 
the fly. Another great benefit — if you update the original PSD file later, 
Dreamweaver adds a little, red arrow to the optimized version in your 
Web page. Click the Update from Original button, and the changes are 
applied automatically. Working with graphics is the focus on Chapter 3, 
and multimedia with Flash is covered in Chapter 11.
 
 Spry features for AJAX: If you want to create drop-down menus, col-
lapsible panels, and other interactive AJAX features, you’ll appreciate 
the Spry menu in the Insert panel and all the ways you can use Spry to 
save time (and coding) with AJAX. See Chapter 13.
 
 Live View: CS4’s new Live View makes it possible to render a page as it’d 
be displayed in a browser so you can see AJAX and other interactive fea-
tures in action without leaving Dreamweaver. Live View uses the WebKit 
rendering engine (the same open source option used in Safari). Not only 
does the new Live View feature save you from launching a browser to test 
these kinds of features, but you can disable JavaScript while you use Live 
View to do things, such as freeze a drop-down list in action so you can 
more easily edit the CSS that controls the drop-down list display.
 
 Code Navigator: The new Code Navigator is a handy way to keep an eye 
on the CSS code for your pages. Anywhere in a Web page, you can right-
click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) and choose Code Navigator to 
open a small window that details the CSS on the page. Roll your cursor 
over any of the listed styles and you see a little pop-up with details of 
the style rule. Double-click a style name, and Dreamweaver takes you 
to the style in the CSS code, which makes editing styles quick and easy 
while you work in design view.
 
 Related Files bar: Just above the workspace, you find a handy list of 
associated files and scripts for any open document in the new Related 
Files bar. The files you find listed include external CSS files, JavaScript 
files (such as those created with the Dreamweaver Spry feature), and 
other programming files. Not only is the Related Files bar a handy refer-
ence that can help you keep track of all the files in your site, but it’s also 
a shortcut. Click any filename to open it, and you can edit and apply the 
changes automatically to the HTML page you’re working on.
Using Dreamweaver on a Mac or PC
Dreamweaver works almost identically on Macintosh or Windows computers. 
To keep screenshots consistent throughout this book, I’ve used a computer 
running Windows Vista. However, I’ve tested the program on both platforms, 
and whenever there is a difference in how a feature works, I indicate that dif-
ference in the instructions.

Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, 
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions 
is in italics? I frequently put new terms in italics and then define them so that 
you know what they mean.
When I type URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses within regular para-
graph text, they look like this: www.digitalfamily.com. Sometimes, how-
ever, I set URLs off on their own line, like this:
www.digitalfamily.com
That’s so you can easily spot them on a page if you want to type them into 
your browser to visit a site. I also assume that your Web browser doesn’t 
require the introductory http:// for Web addresses. If you use an older 
browser, remember to type this before the address (also make sure you 
include that part of the address when you’re creating links in Dreamweaver).
Even though Dreamweaver makes knowing HTML code unnecessary, you 
may want to wade into HTML waters occasionally. I include HTML code in 
this book when I think it can help you better understand how things work in 
design view. Sometimes it’s easier to remove or edit a tag in code view than 
design view. When I do provide examples, such as the following code which 
links a URL to a Web page, I set off the HTML in the same monospaced type 
as URLs:
<A HREF=”http://www.digitalfamily.com”>Janine’s Digital 
Family Web Site</A>
When I introduce you to a new set of features, such as options in a dialog 
box, I set these items apart with bullet lists so you can see that they’re all 
related. When I want you to follow instructions, I use numbered step lists to 
walk you through the process.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re like most of the Web designers I know, you don’t have time to wade 
through a thick book before you start working on your Web site. That’s why 
I wrote Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies in a way that makes it easy for you to 
find the answers you need quickly. You don’t have to read this book cover 
to cover. If you’re in a hurry, go right to the information you need most and 
then get back to work. If you’re new to Web design or you want to know the 
intricacies of Dreamweaver, skim through the chapters to get an overview 

5
 Introduction
and then go back and read what’s most relevant to your project in greater 
detail. Whether you’re building a simple site for the first time or working to 
redesign a complex site for the umpteenth time, you’ll find everything you 
need in these pages.
Foolish Assumptions
Although Dreamweaver is designed for professional developers, I don’t assume 
you’re a pro — at least not yet. In keeping with the philosophy behind the For 
Dummies series, this book is an easy-to-use guide designed for readers with a 
wide range of experience. Being interested in Web design and wanting to create 
a Web site is key, but that desire is all that I expect from you.
If you’re an experienced Web designer, Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies is 
an ideal reference for you because it gets you working quickly with this pro-
gram, starting with basic Web page design features and progressing to more 
advanced options. If you’re new to Web design, this book walks you through 
all you need to know to create a Web site, from creating a new page to pub-
lishing your finished project on the Web.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the learning curve associated with any new program, I 
organized Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies as a complete reference. This sec-
tion provides a breakdown of the five parts of the book and what you can find 
in each one. Each chapter walks you through the features of Dreamweaver 
step by step, providing tips and helping you understand the vocabulary of 
Web design as you go along.
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites
Part I introduces you to the basic concepts of Web design as well as the 
main features of Dreamweaver. In Chapter 1, I give you an overview of the 
many approaches to Web design, so you can best determine how you want 
to build your Web site before you get into the details of which features in 
Dreamweaver are best suited to any particular design approach. In Chapter 2, 
I start you on the road to your first Web site, including creating a new site, 
importing an existing site, creating new Web pages, applying basic format-
ting, and setting links. To make this chapter more interesting and help you 
see how all these features come together, I walk you through creating a real 
Web page as I show you how the features work.

Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies 
In Chapter 3, I move onto graphics, with an introduction to creating graph-
ics for the Web, an overview of the differences in formats (GIFs, JPEGs, and 
PNG files), and detailed instructions for adding and positioning graphics in 
your pages. In Chapter 4, you discover Dreamweaver’s testing and publishing 
features, so you can start uploading pages to the Internet as soon as you’re 
ready. If you work with a team of designers, you may be especially interested 
in the Check In/Check Out feature, which makes it easier to manage a site 
when several people are working together. You’ll also find instructions for 
using integrated e-mail for communicating with other team members.
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options
Chapter 5 provides an overview of how Cascading Style Sheets work and 
how they can save you time. CSS has become the way to create page designs 
and manage formatting on Web pages, and these features have been nicely 
improved in Dreamweaver CS4. In this chapter, you find descriptions of the 
style definition options available in Dreamweaver as well as instructions for 
creating and applying styles. In Chapter 6, I take you further into CSS, intro-
ducing you to the power of <div> tags and how to create CSS layouts. Here 
you’ll find instructions for working with Dreamweaver’s Layers features, as 
well as how to create centered CSS designs and fluid layouts.
In Chapter 7, you discover how to use HTML table features (and when they’re 
still recommended on the Web). In Chapter 8, you find all you need to know 
about designing a site with frames and iframes. (This chapter also includes tips 
about when frames are useful and why they should generally be avoided.)
In Chapter 9, I introduce you to some of my favorite Dreamweaver features, 
including sophisticated template capabilities, that enable you to create more 
consistent designs and make global updates across many pages at once. I 
also cover Dreamweaver’s Library items, which can be used to place and 
update commonly used elements, such as navigation bars or copyright tags.
Part III: Making It Cool with 
Multimedia and JavaScript
In Part III, you discover how cool your site can look when you add interac-
tive image features, audio, video, and Flash. In Chapter 10, you find instruc-
tions for creating an interactive photo gallery with the Swap Image behavior, 
as well as how to use other features in Dreamweaver’s Behaviors panel, 
including the Open New Browser behavior. In Chapter 11, you find out what 
it takes to add multimedia to your Web pages, including how to insert and 

7
 Introduction
create links to a variety of file types — from Flash to video and audio files. In 
Chapter 12, I cover Dreamweaver’s HTML form options, which you can use 
to add feedback forms, surveys, and much more. In Chapter 13, you discover 
how great the Spry features are for adding AJAX interactivity to your site. In 
this chapter, you find instructions for creating and customizing drop-down 
lists, collapsible panels, and more.
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content
Part IV features three chapters that cover the most advanced features in 
Dreamweaver CS4. Chapter 14 is designed to help you understand how database-
driven Web sites work and why they’re so important on the Web. In Chapter 15, 
you discover how to add dynamic content to your pages, define data sources, 
display recordsets, and take advantage of Dreamweaver CS4’s new Spry features.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V features three quick references to help you develop the best Web sites 
possible. Chapter 16 provides a collection of online resources where you can 
register domain names and find hosting services, as well as a few services 
that can help you take care of more advanced challenges, such as setting up 
an e-commerce system. In Chapter 17, you find ten design tips to help you get 
the most out of Dreamweaver.

n the early days, Web design was relatively easy — and vanilla boring. 
You could combine images and text, but that’s about it; no complex lay-
outs, no fancy fonts, and certainly no multimedia or animation.
Over the years, Web design has evolved into an increasingly complex field, 
and Dreamweaver has evolved with it, adding new features that go way 
beyond the basics of combining a few words and images.
When I first started learning to create Web sites in the mid 1990s, it was easy 
to learn and easy to teach others how to do it. More than ten years and a 
dozen books later, it’s a lot more complex, and I’ve come to realize that one 
of the first things you have to understand about Web design is that there isn’t 
just one way to create a Web site anymore.
Today, you can learn how to design simple Web sites with HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language) in a matter of hours or you can spend years developing 
the advanced programming skills it takes to create complex Web sites like 
the ones you see at Amazon.com or MSNBC.
For everything in between, Dreamweaver is the clear choice among profes-
sional Web designers as well as among a growing number of people who want 
to build sites for their hobbies, clubs, families, and small businesses.
Before I dive into the details of creating a Web page in Dreamweaver, I think 
it’s helpful to start by introducing the many ways you can create a Web site. 
The more you understand about the various approaches to Web design, the 
better you can appreciate your options.

12
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Developing a New Site
In a nutshell, building a Web site involves creating individual pages and link-
ing them to other pages. You need to have a home page, the first page visi-
tors see when they arrive at your Web address, (also known as your URL), 
and that page needs to bring them into the rest of the pages of the site, usu-
ally with links to each of the main sections of the site. Those pages, in turn, 
link to subsections that can then lead to deeper subsections.
A big part of planning a Web site is determining how to divide the pages of 
your site into sections and how those sections should link to one another. 
Dreamweaver makes creating pages and setting links easy, but how you orga-
nize the pages is up to you.
 
If you’re new to this, you may think you don’t need to worry much about how 
your Web site will grow and develop. Think again. All good Web sites grow, 
and the bigger they get, the harder they are to manage. Planning the path of 
growth for your Web site before you begin can make a tremendous difference 
later. Neglecting to think about growth is probably one of the most common 
mistakes among new designers. This becomes even more serious when more 
than one person is working on the same site. Without a clearly established 
site organization and some common conventions for tasks like naming files, 
confusion reigns.
Managing your site’s structure
Managing the structure of a Web site has two sides: the side that users see, 
which depends on how you set up links, and the side that’s behind-the-
scenes, which depends on how you organize files and folders.
What the user sees
The side that the user sees is all about navigation. When users arrive at your 
home page, where do you direct them? How do they move from one page 
to another in your site? A good Web site is designed so that users navigate 
easily and intuitively and can make a beeline to the information most relevant 
to them. As you plan, make sure that users can
 
 Access key information easily from more than one place in the site
 
 Move back and forth easily between pages and sections
 
 Return to main pages and subsections in one step
Setting links is easy in Dreamweaver; the challenge is to make sure that 
those links are easy for visitors to follow. One of the best ways to ensure that 
visitors can easily move around your site is to create a navigation or menu 

13
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
bar to include links to the main pages of your site on every page of your 
site. You find instructions in Chapter 6 for creating a menu bar with CSS. In 
Chapter 13, you find out how to use Dreamweaver’s Spry features to create a 
drop-down list using AJAX. And in Chapter 9, you find instructions for using 
Dreamweaver’s template and library features, which make including menus 
on your pages faster and easier to update.
What’s behind the scenes
The second side to managing your Web site structure happens behind the 
scenes (where your users can’t see the information, but you want some kind 
of organizational system to remember what’s what). You’ll have files for all the 
images, HTML pages, animations, sound files, and anything else you put in your 
Web site. Before you begin building your site with Dreamweaver, think about 
how to keep track of all these files. At minimum, consider the following:
 
 A file naming system: For example, naming image files consistently can 
make them easier to find if you need to edit them later. Similarly, giving 
the pages the same name for the main sections of your site that you use 
in the text of the links on your pages, can make it easier to set the links.
 
 A folder structure: When your Web site grows past a handful of pages, 
organizing them in separate folders or directories can help you keep 
track. Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes this easy by providing a Files 
panel where you can see all the files of your site and even move and 
rename files and folders. (You find detailed instructions for organizing 
the files and folders in a Web site in Chapters 2 and 4.)
Understanding the basics of XHTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the formatting language used to create 
Web pages. When you open a Web page in a Web browser, the HTML code 
tells the Web browser how to display the text, images, and other content 
on the page. By default, Dreamweaver CS4 writes XHTML instead of HTML 
because XHTML is a stricter version of HTML that’s designed to comply with 
contemporary Web standards. Among the requirements, XHTML must be 
written in lowercase letters.
The basic unit of XHTML is a tag. You can recognize XHTML tags by their 
angle brackets. You can format text and other elements on your page by 
placing them inside the XHTML tags. When you use the formatting tools in 
Dreamweaver, the program automatically inserts tags in the code. You can 
view the code behind any Web page by choosing View➪Source in most Web 
browsers or by choosing the Split or Code view options in Dreamweaver. 
When you use split view, you can see the code and design views simultane-
ously, and when you select text or an image in one view, it’s automatically 
highlighted in the other view.

14
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Although at first glance, the code can look like hieroglyphics, basic HTML is 
not that complex. Most XHTML tags work in pairs and include an open tag 
as well as a close tag that surround content. For example, the <b> tag tells a 
browser to begin making text bold and the closing </b> tag tells the browser 
to end the bold formatting. Other tags can stand alone, such as the <br /> 
tag, which adds a line break. XHTML tags must have a closing tag, even if 
there’s only one tag, and closing tags always contain a forward slash (/). As a 
result, the line break tag in XHTML looks like this: <br />. 
<h1>Format headlines with heading tags like this</h1>
<p>Paragraph tags add a line break and a line space 
between elements. <b>This tag makes text 
bold.</b> This text will not be bold.</p>
One of the great advantages of using Dreamweaver is that you can specify 
formatting by clicking buttons or using menu commands, and Dreamweaver 
takes care of writing the underlying XHTML code for you.
In the old days, many Web designers created sites entirely in HMTL, using 
tags such as HTML tables to create page layouts. These days, the best Web 
designs are created by combining HTML tags, such as the Heading tags, 
which include <h1> through <h6>, the <div> tag, which divides sections of a 
page, and many other tags, with CSS rules, covered in the next section.
Comparing Web Designs
Throughout this book, you find chapters covering a variety of aspects of Web 
design, from the basics of creating a page and adding images and links to more 
complex concepts such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and one of the newest 
options in Web design AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). You can 
even use these different technologies in combination. The next few sections 
are designed to help you understand the differences in the many approaches 
to creating page designs to help you decide which one is best for your Web 
site, whether you’re building a new site or updating an existing one.
Appreciating the advantages of CSS
A Web site designed with CSS separates content from design. Keeping the 
content of a site (such as the text and images) separate from the instructions 
that tell a browser how the page should look has many benefits:
 
 CSS simplifies design changes. For example, instead of formatting every 
headline in your site as 24-point Arial bold, you can create a style for 
the <h1> tag and use that tag to format all your headlines. Then if you 

15
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
decide later that you want all your headlines to use the Garamond font 
instead of Arial, change the style for the <h1> tag only once in the style 
sheet and it’s automatically applied everywhere you’ve used that style.
 
 CSS enables you to create different style sheets for different audiences 
and devices. In the future, this is likely to become even more important 
as a growing number of people view Web pages on everything from 
giant, flat-screen monitors to tiny, cell-phone screens. 
 
 As you get more advanced with CSS, you can create multiple style sheets 
for the same Web page. For example, you can create one that’s ideally 
suited to a small screen like the one shown in Figure 1-1, another one 
that works best when the page is printed, and yet another designed with 
a larger font size for anyone who may have trouble reading the small 
print that is so common on Web pages.
 
 In Figure 1-1, you see one of the coolest preview features in 
Dreamweaver — Device Central — where you can preview your page 
designs in a variety of cell phone models to see just how different they 
can look when displayed on these small screens.
 
 Using CSS makes your site comply with the current standards. Today, 
the W3C, which sets standards for the Internet, recommends CSS 
because the best CSS designs are accessible, flexible, and adaptable. 
Following standards has become increasingly important as Web design 
has become more complex over the years. 
 
Figure 1-1:

you create 
designs that

ter on large 
and small 
screens.
 

16
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 Web sites designed in CSS are accessible to more visitors. When Web 
designers talk about accessibility, they mean creating a site that can be 
accessed by anyone who might ever visit your pages — that includes 
people with limited vision who use special browsers (often called screen 
readers) that read Web pages aloud, as well as many others who use spe-
cialized browsers for a variety of other reasons.
 
 If you work for a university, a nonprofit, a government agency, or a simi-
lar organization, you may be required to create accessible designs. Even 
if you’re not required to use CSS or to design for accessibility, it’s still 
good practice. That’s why Dreamweaver includes so many CSS features 
and a collection of predesigned CSS layouts like the one I used to create 
the site design shown in Figure 1-2. You find instructions for creating 
CSS layouts like this one in Chapter 6.
Reviewing old-school designs
Although CSS is by far the best option for creating Web designs today, many 
sites on the Web were created with tables to control the layout, like the one 
shown in Figure 1-3. Old-school sites like this one were created with the 
HTML table tag. To help you appreciate how this page was created, I altered 
the original design to display the table borders, although most designers turn 
off table borders when using Tables to create layouts like this.
 
Figure 1-2: 
This site 
was 
designed 
with one 
of Dream-
weaver’s 
CSS layouts.
 

17
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
 
Figure 1-3: 
In the old 
days, the 
only way 
you could 
create a 
2-column 
Web design 
was by 
using an 
HTML table 
like the one 
shown here 
to control 
the place-
ment of text 
and images.
 
Because you can merge and split table cells, you can use them to control 
the layout of a page, positioning text and images more or less where you 
want them. If you set the table border to 0 (instead of 2 as I did here to show 
you the borders), you can hide the table so that it doesn’t interfere with the 
design.
Although I recommend that you redesign sites like the one shown in Figure 
1-3 with CSS and <div> tags (covered in Chapter 6), I do understand that 
some designers still find it easier to create layouts with tables, and not every-
one has time to redesign existing Web sites. 
 
Tables are still considered the best way to format tabular data like the col-
umns and rows that might make up a list of winners from the chocolate 
game with their photos, and scores. In Chapter 7, you find an introduction to 
Dreamweaver’s Table features and tips for creating accessible table designs 
by including the table header tag in all your tables. You can even combine CSS 
with tables to create more streamlined designs.
Considering frame options
In Chapter 8, you find instructions for creating Web sites that use frames, 
like the Flamingo site shown in Figure 1-4. Among Web designers, frames are 

18
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
a little like the plastic Pink Flamingos stuck in the front yards of so many 
homes in South Florida; some people love how kitsch they are, others just 
think they’re tacky. Although frames still have a place on the Web, many 
designers don’t like them because they can make navigation confusing for 
visitors and make it difficult to link to pages within a site.
If you want to create pages like the one in Figure 1-4 that display multiple 
Web pages in one browser window, you’ll find everything you need in 
Chapter 8.
Creating dynamic Web sites
When you use Dreamweaver’s most advanced features, you can create Web 
sites (like the one shown in Figure 1-5) that connect to a database and dis-
play content dynamically on a Web page.
What’s happening behind the scenes of a site like the one at www.
TotalTraining.com gets complicated fast, but one of the advantages 
of using this kind of technology is that you can create a Web page like the 
one in Figure 1-5 that displays a collection of products and then display 
product information for each product individually, drawing the product 
photos and other details from a database as a user requests the infor-
mation. When a site grows bigger than about 100 pages, graduating to a 
database-driven model like this is far more efficient than creating individual 
static pages for every product description or other content in your site. 
Dreamweaver supports many technologies for this kind of site development, 
including PHP, JSP, ASP.NET, and ASP.
In addition to drawing content from a database, you can also create interac-
tive features that display content created by visitors to your site, such as an 
online discussion board or any other system that collects data in one page 
and then uses that data to determine what’s displayed on another page.
That’s how the most advanced sites on the Web do things like remind you of 
the last book you searched for or keep track of your order as you select prod-
ucts in an online shopping cart. Although I can’t cover all these advanced fea-
tures in this book, you find an introduction to creating database-driven Web 
sites in Chapters 14 and 15.
One other thing I feel compelled to mention at this point is that most of the 
big, complicated Web sites in the world were created by a team of develop-
ers, not just one person. In the case of the Total Training site, a great team of 
people was involved in the many elements of the site, from the design, to the 
videos, to the programming. If you’re working with a team of developers, you 
may appreciate Dreamweaver’s site management features, such as the ability 
to check pages in and out so that no one overwrites anyone else’s work. You 
find information about these features in Chapter 4.

Understanding Browser Differences
Before you start creating Web pages, know that no matter how carefully you 
create your designs, your pages will never look exactly the same to every 
possible visitor to your site. That’s because one of the greatest advantages 
of the Web is also one of the biggest challenges. HTML was created to share 
information in a way that could be displayed on every computer on the 
planet. Unfortunately, not all those computers use the same browsers, the 
same fonts, or the same-sized monitors. On top of that, a lot of older Web 
browsers are still in use out there, and they can’t display the latest Web 
features. Even all the newer browsers don’t display the latest Web design 
options the same way.
 
Because of these browser differences, you have more design control today 
than ever before and the capability to create more interesting Web sites, but 
you also have more challenges if you want your pages to look good to every-
one who might visit your site. My best advice is to test, test, test, and then ask 
your friends to test your pages some more. If you want to play it safe, the sim-
pler your page design, the more likely it will look the same, or at least similar, 
to all your visitors.
If you want to create more interesting designs and you want to reach the 
broadest possible audience, pay special attention to Dreamweaver’s browser 
preview and compatibility features and be prepared to look for more 
advanced books and training programs when you finish with this book. Entire 
books and Web sites are dedicated to creating highly complex CSS layouts 
that display well on a variety of computers and browsers.
In Chapter 4, you find more information about Web browser differences, as 
well as Dreamweaver’s testing and compatibility features, which can help 
ensure your pages work well for a broad audience.
Introducing the Workspace 
in Dreamweaver CS4
Dreamweaver can seem a bit overwhelming at first — it has so many features, 
spread among so many panels, toolbars, and dialog boxes that you can easily 
get lost. If you prefer to understand by poking around, have at it (and feel 
free to skip ahead to Chapter 2, where you start building your first Web page 
right away). If you want a tour before you get started, the last few sections 
of this chapter introduce you to the interface and are designed to give you a 
quick overview of the features in this powerful program.

21
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
Here’s a bird’s-eye view of getting started in the Dreamweaver interface:
 
1. When you launch Dreamweaver, the Welcome screen appears in the 
main area of the program (and reappears anytime you don’t have a file 
open, unless you close it by selecting the Don’t Show Again option).
 
2. From the Welcome screen, you can choose to create a new page from 
one of the many Dreamweaver predesigned sample files, or you can 
create a new blank page by selecting HTML from the Create New options 
in the middle column.
 
3. When you select HTML and you choose None from the Layout list, 
Dreamweaver creates a new blank HTML page in the main workspace, as 
shown in Figure 1-6.
 
 The workspace consists of a Document window, which displays the 
page you’re working on and is where you add text, images, and other 
elements that will appear on your Web pages. The Document window is 
surrounded by a collection of panels, toolbars, and menus that provide 
easy access to Dreamweaver’s many features. More detailed descrip-
tions of each of these follows.

22
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Changing workspace layouts
Dreamweaver CS4 has eight preset workspace layouts to choose from. These 
layouts arrange the many toolbars, panels, and other features in popular con-
figurations. You can change layouts by choosing Window➪Workspace Layout 
and then choosing from any of the listed layouts, such as Designer, as shown 
in Figure 1-6, or App Developer, as shown in Figure 1-7. You can also access 
the list of layouts by clicking the arrow next to the layout button, as shown 
open in Figure 1-7.
As the names imply, the Designer layouts were created for people who have 
a design background, whereas the App and Coder layouts were created for 
programmers who are likely to prefer working in the code view more than in 
design view.
In addition to the preset workspace layouts, you can create your own by 
opening, closing, or moving any of the panels, inspectors, or other features, 
as described in the following sections. You can even save your own layouts 
by choosing Window➪Workspace Layout➪New Workspace and giving each 
new workspace layout its own name, which is then added to the menu so you 
can easily reset it. If you move a panel or inspector and then want to return it 
to its original location, choose Reset Workspace to restore any of the preset 
layouts.
 
Create a collection of workspace layouts optimized for common tasks, such as 
creating and applying CSS, or working with database content, and save them 
so that you can easily arrange the program to best suit your preferences.
The menu bar
Like most programs you’ve used, the menu at the top of the screen provides 
easy access to most program features, including the options you find in the 
Insert bar, Property inspector, and panels, as well as a few others that are 
available only from the menu.
The Document toolbar
Across the top of the workspace, just under the menu bar and above the 
workspace, is the Document toolbar, as shown in Figure 1-6. Here you find 
the Code, Split, and Design view buttons, which make it easy to change from 
displaying only the code or design in the workspace, or both the code and 
the design (using split view, which is shown in Figure 1-6). You also find 
the Live View button, which provides a preview of the page, complete with 

23
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
working links and dynamic content so that the page works in Dreamweaver 
much as it would when previewed in a Web browser. The Title field dis-
plays the page title, which is the text that appears at the top of a browser 
window when a page is displayed. This is also the text that’s saved when a 
visitor bookmarks a page. Other features in the toolbar, include the Preview 
in Browser button, which launches the page in a Web browser; the View 
Options button, which provides access to additional display features, such as 
the ruler and guides; and the Visual Aids button, which makes it easy to turn 
on special display features, such as CSS Layout Outlines, which add a thin, 
dotted line around otherwise invisible elements, such as <div> tags.
The Document window
The big, open section in the main area of the workspace is the Document 
window, which is where you work on new and existing pages. If you use the 
Designer workspace layout, as shown in Figure 1-6, the Document window is 
displayed in split view, showing the code at the top of the window and the 
design at the bottom. If you want to hide the code, which makes it easier to 
focus on your designs, click the Design view button in the Document toolbar. 
Click the Code view button to see only the HTML code and click Split view 
button to divide the window.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
The docking panels
The docking panels are located to the right of the work area when you 
choose any of the designer layouts, such as the one shown in Figure 1-6, or 
on the left when you choose any of the developer layouts, such as the one 
shown in Figure 1-7.
The docking panels display a variety of important features in Dreamweaver, 
including the Insert panel (described in detail in the following section), the 
Files panel, which displays all the files and folders in a site, and the CSS 
Styles panel, which displays a list of all the Cascading Style Sheets available 
to the document.
 
 To open and close panels, click the gray bar at the top of any panel next 
to the panel’s name or double-click the name in the tab at the top of the 
panel.
 
 To move panels anywhere on the screen, click the dark gray bar at the 
top of the panel and drag it to the desired location.
 
 To display more panels, select the panel name from the Window menu.
 
 To expand or collapse all the visible panels at once, click the double 
arrow at the top-right corner of the top most panel.
 
 To expand or collapse a single panel when the panel collection is col-
lapsed, click the name of the panel, as shown in Figure 1-8.

 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
The Insert panel
The Insert panel, located at the top of the panel section, includes seven sub-
categories, each with a different set of icons representing common features. 
Click the small arrow to the right of the name to access the drop-down list 
and switch from the buttons of one subcategory to the buttons for another. 
The options are
 
 Common Insert panel: Displays icons for many of the most common fea-
tures, including links, tables, and images.
 
 Layout Insert panel: Displays div, table, and frame options essential for 
creating page layouts.
 
 Forms Insert panel: Features the most common form elements, such as 
radio buttons and boxes.
 
 Data Insert panel: Displays options for building dynamic Web pages 
powered by database material.
 
 Spry Insert panel: Features a collection of widgets that combines HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive page elements, such as drop-
down lists and collapsible panels.
 
 InContext Editing Insert panel: Displays features that are handy for cre-
ating Repeating and Editable Regions, as well as managing CSS classes, 
when working with dynamic content.
 
 Text Insert panel: Displays common text-formatting features, including 
paragraphs, breaks, and lists.
 
 Favorites Insert panel: Enables you to right-click (Windows) or Control-
click (Mac) to add any of the icons from any of the other Insert bar 
options to create your own collection of favorite features.
At the end of the drop-down list are the two options that control the display 
of the list of options in the Insert panels. Color Icons restores the color to 
the icons. Hide Labels/Show Labels enables you to display the names of the 
Insert panel features next to each icon, or to remove the names. 
The Property inspector
The Property inspector is docked at the bottom of the workspace in 
Dreamweaver. If you prefer, you can click the gray bar at the top of the 
inspector and drag it to detach it so that it floats in the workspace. You 

26
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
can move the inspector anywhere on the screen or you can drag it into the 
panel group and dock it there. When you dock the inspector with the other 
panels, you can expand and collapse it just as you would any other panels. 
To restore the inspector to its original location, choose Window➪Workspace 
Layout➪Reset. I rather like that the Property inspector is handy, yet out of 
the way, at the bottom of the screen.
The Property inspector displays the properties, or options, for any selected 
element on a page, and it changes based on what’s selected. For example, if 
you click an image, the Property inspector displays image properties. If you 
click a Flash file, the Property inspector displays Flash properties.
In Dreamweaver CS4, Adobe split the Property inspector into two sections 
for many elements, one for HTML features and the other for CSS. Use the CSS 
and HTML buttons on the left side of the Property inspector, as shown in 
Figure 1-9, to switch from one to the other. (You find detailed instructions for 
how to use these two modes of the Property inspector in Chapters 5 and 6.)
 
Figure 1-9: 
The Status 
bar and the 
Property 
inspector in 
CSS mode.
 
 
At the bottom-right corner of the Property inspector, you see a small arrow. 
Click this arrow to reduce the inspector. Click it again to expand the inspector 
to reveal additional attributes that let you control more advanced features, 
such as the image map options when a graphic is selected. Click the gray bar 
at the top of the inspector to close and open the inspector.
The status bar
The status bar is located at the bottom of the Document window and 
just above the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 1-9. The status bar 
includes access to a number of features that control the display of a page in 
Dreamweaver’s workspace, such as the magnifying glass, which enlarges the 
view of the open page.

27
 Chapter 1: The Many Ways to Design a Web Page
On the far left of the status bar, as shown in the top of Figure 1-9, you find 
the tag selector, which displays the HTML tags and CSS rules that apply to 
any selected element on the page. In Figure 1-9, the cursor is inside a text 
block that’s formatted with the <h1> tag, which is inside a <div> tag with a 
#container ID, which is inside the <body> tag. Clicking any tag in the tag 
selector selects the tag and all its contents in the workspace. Right-clicking 
(Control-clicking on a Mac) a tag opens a pop-up menu with formatting 
options that make it easy to add or remove tags and CSS rules.
Toward the middle of the status bar, you find the select tool, hand tool, zoom 
tool, and magnification pop-up menu, which you can use to move, enlarge, or 
reduce the display of a page in the workspace.
On the far right side of the status bar is the download size/download time 
tool, which displays the total size of the Web page, including all images and 
other elements on the page and the estimated time it will take the page to 
download, based on the connection speed specified in Dreamweaver’s pref-
erences. By default, the connection speed is set to estimate the download 
time of a page over a 56K modem, but you can change it to a faster or slower 
speed by changing the preferences, as shown in the following section.
Changing preference settings
The more you use Dreamweaver, the more you’re likely to appreciate the 
capability to customize its features. Remember that you can always change 
the workspace to better suit the way you like to work, and you can easily 
alter Dreamweaver’s preference settings using the Preferences dialog box.
To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences on a Windows 
computer, or Dreamweaver➪Preferences on a Mac. Dreamweaver includes 
19 different categories in the Preferences dialog box and makes it possible to 
change the appearance, default settings, and many other options throughout 
the program.

Opening and Creating Sites
In This Chapter
 Opening an existing Web site
 Creating a new Web site
 Making new pages
 Inserting and formatting text
 Creating links
I
f you’re ready to dive in and start building a Web site, you’ve come to 
the right place. If you’re working on an existing site and need to make 
changes, this is also the place to start because in this chapter, you discover 
an important preliminary step — the site definition process, which enables 
Dreamweaver to keep track of the images and links in your site. After you’ve 
completed the site definition process, you’re ready to create Web pages, 
insert text and images, set links, and more. (You discover how to do all those 
things later in this chapter, too.) But whatever you do, don’t skip the first 
step of defining a site — it only takes a minute or two.
 
Although you can use Dreamweaver without doing this initial site definition, 
you run the risk of breaking links when you upload your site, and then many 
of Dreamweaver’s features, such as automated link checking and the Library, 
won’t work at all.
Setting Up a New or Existing Site
The first thing to understand about the site definition process is that you 
need to store all your site’s resources in one local root folder on your hard 
drive and identify the folder in Dreamweaver. That’s because all the elements 
of your site must remain in the same relative location on your hard drive 
as they are on your Web server in order for your links, images, and other 
elements to work properly.
As you go through the site definition process, you can create a new folder 
on your hard drive and designate that as your local root folder or you can 
identify an existing folder.

30
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
The Site Definition dialog box also contains a category where you can set up 
your site to use Dreamweaver’s file transfer features, including its FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol) capabilities. (FTP is a common method of copying files to 
and from computers connected across a network, such as the Internet.) To 
keep things simple for now, you can skip those file transfer feature settings 
(as well as Dreamweaver’s other publishing and site management features in 
the Site Definition dialog box). In Chapter 4, you find detailed instructions for 
using Dreamweaver’s publishing features as well as instructions for download-
ing an existing Web site hosted on a remote server.
 
As a general rule, you first create a Web site on your computer’s hard drive, 
where you use Dreamweaver’s preview options to test the site before it’s vis-
ible on the Internet. Then when you’re ready to publish the completed site, 
transfer it to a Web server. A Web server is a computer with a permanent 
connection to the Internet and special software that enables it to communi-
cate with Web browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. Find detailed 
instructions for publishing a Web site in Chapter 4.
Defining a Web site in Dreamweaver
If the site definition process seems a little confusing at first, don’t worry; it’s a 
quick, relatively painless process that you have to do only once for each site.
Whether you’re creating a new site or working on an existing site, the follow-
ing steps walk you through the process of defining a root site folder.
 
1. Choose Site➪New Site.
 
 The Site Definition dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab.
 
 The Advanced window appears, as shown in Figure 2-1. If you prefer, you 
can use the Basic Wizard that steps you through the setup process, but I 
find it faster and easier to view all the options at once with the advanced 
option.
 
3. In the Category box on the left, make sure that the Local Info category 
is selected.
 
4. In the Site Name text box, type a name for your site.
 
 You can call your site whatever you like; this name is used only to 
help you keep track of your sites in Dreamweaver. Many people work 
on more than one Web site, and the name you enter here is the name 
also listed in the Files panel. To switch from working on one site in 
Dreamweaver to another, you select the site’s name from the drop-down 
list in the Files panel. Similarly, to edit any of the Site Definition settings 
for a site, you select its name from the Manage Sites dialog box, which 

31
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
you can open by choosing Site➪Manage Sites. In the example shown in 
Figure 2-1, Lions is the name of the new site.
 
 
5. Click the Browse icon (hint: it looks like a file folder) next to the Local 
Root Folder text box and browse your hard drive to locate the folder 
you want to serve as the main folder for all the files in your Web site.
 
 If you’re working on an existing site, select the folder that contains the 
files for that site. If you’re creating a new site, you can create a new 
folder as you go through this process by using the Create New Folder 
icon at the top of the dialog box in Windows or the New Folder button at 
the bottom of the dialog if you’re using a Mac.
 
 The point is to simply select the folder so that Dreamweaver can identify 
where all the files and folders for your site will be stored.
 
6. Specify the Default Images folder by entering the location or by using 
the Browse icon to locate it.
 
 This works just like the previous step, you simply want to browse to the 
images folder and select it so that Dreamweaver can identify the location.
 
 Although you don’t have to identify an images folder, this is another way 
Dreamweaver helps keep track of things for you. You can store images 
in more than one folder in your site, but I still recommend that you iden-
tify a main image folder. If you’re setting up a new site, you can create a 
new folder inside your site folder and identify that as your images folder, 
even if it’s empty.

Definition 
dialog box

32
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
7. For Links Relative To, leave the Document option selected unless 
you know that you want your links to be set up relative to the root 
of your site.
 
 This setting controls how the path is set in links. If you’re working on a site 
with other developers and you’re not sure, check with your colleagues. If 
you’re working alone on your own site, Links Relative to Document is the 
simplest option to manage. (You can read more about relative versus root 
links in the section “Setting Links,” later in this chapter.)
 
8. In the HTTP Address text box, type the URL of your Web site.
 
 The HTTP address is the URL, or Web address, that your site will have 
when published on a Web server. If you don’t yet know your site’s Web 
address or don’t plan to publish the site on a Web server, you can leave 
this box blank. Include the http:// at the beginning.
 
9. Select the Use Case-Sensitive Link Checking box.
 
 Unless you know for sure that you don’t have to worry about the case of 
your filenames, checking this box means Dreamweaver ensures that the 
case matches for all your site’s links (which many Web hosting services 
require).
 
10. Select the Enable Cache option.
 
 Dreamweaver creates a local cache of your site to quickly reference 
the location of files in your site. The local cache speeds up many site 
management features of the program and takes only a few seconds to 
create.
 
11. Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box and save your settings.
 
 If the folder you selected as your local site folder already contains files 
or folders, they’re automatically cached and all the files and folders in 
your site are displayed in the Files panel. As you see in Figure 2-2, my 
newly-created Lions site contains only an empty images folder.
 
 If you haven’t checked the Enable Cache option, a message box appears 
asking whether you want to create a cache for the site. Choose Yes to 
speed up Dreamweaver’s site management features.
Editing and managing multiple sites
You can define as many sites as you like in Dreamweaver and change from 
one site to another by selecting the site name in the Files panel. To load a 
different site into the Files panel, use the drop-down arrow next to the site 
name and choose the name of the site you want to display.

Site Definition dialog box, where you can make changes to any of the settings.
In Figure 2-4, I selected the DigitalFamily.com site to edit. You can use this 
dialog box to define a new site, remove an existing site, duplicate a site, and 
import or export a site. Note that when you remove a site from the Manage 
Sites dialog box, you don’t delete the site’s files or folders from your hard 
drive; you simply remove the site definition in Dreamweaver.

Creating New Pages
Every Web site begins with a single page. Visitors are first greeted by the front 
page — or home page — of your site, and that’s usually a good place to start 
building. Dreamweaver makes creating new pages easy: You can work from 
the Welcome screen or use the New Document window. The following sections 
explain both methods, and you find details about naming those new pages, too.
Starting from the Welcome screen
When the program opens, you’re greeted by a Welcome screen with short-
cuts to many handy features for creating new pages in a variety of formats:
 
 If you want to create a simple, blank Web page, choose HTML from the 
Create New list in the middle column (see Figure 2-5).
 
 If you’re creating a dynamic site, choose ColdFusion, PHP, or one of the 
other dynamic site options. (If you don’t even know what those options 
mean, you probably won’t need to use them yet, but you can find some 
information about these advanced options in Part IV.)
 
If you prefer not to use the Welcome screen, you can turn it off by selecting 
the Don’t Show Again box in the bottom-left corner.

Creating a page with the 
New Document window
You can also create a new page by using the New Document window avail-
able from the File menu, as you see in the following the steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens.
 
2. From the left side of the screen, select Blank Page.
 
3. From the Page Type list, select HTML and then choose Create.
 
4. From the Layout section, choose <none>.
 
5. Choose File➪Save to save your page and give it a filename following 
the guidelines in the upcoming sections, “Naming new page files” and 
“Naming the first page index.html.”

36
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 You find many other options in the Dreamweaver New Document 
window, including a wide range of predesigned layouts and templates. 
For now, I start with a simple blank page. You find instructions for cus-
tomizing CSS layouts in Chapter 6 and for working with templates in 
Chapter 9.
 
 Get in the habit of saving new Web pages in your main root Web site 
folder as soon as you create them, even though they’re still blank. As you 
create links or add images to your pages, Dreamweaver needs to be able 
to identify the location of your page. Although Dreamweaver sets tempo-
rary links until your page is saved, saving a page first is always best.
Naming new page files
Over the years, I’ve received many e-mail messages from panicked Web design-
ers because of broken links caused by filename conflicts. Because these prob-
lems usually don’t occur until after a Web site is published on a server, they 
can be especially confusing and difficult to understand. If you’re publishing 
your Web site to a Web server that runs on Mac or Windows, the following 
may not apply to you; but if you’re using a Web server that runs Unix or Linux 
(which is what many commercial Web hosting companies use), the following 
instructions are especially important. If you’re not sure, follow these rules 
when you save Web pages, images, and other files on your site to be safe:
 
 Include an extension at the end to identify the file type (such as 
.html for HTML files or .gif for GIF images). Dreamweaver automati-
cally adds the .html file extension to the end of HTML files (which 
works for most Web servers), but you can change the extensions in 
Dreamweaver’s preference dialog box if necessary for your Web server. 
See the “Showing file extensions in Windows” sidebar on viewing file 
extensions in Windows.
 
 Don’t use spaces or special characters in the filename. For example, 
don’t name a Web page with an apostrophe, such as cat’s page.html. 
If you want to separate words, you can use the underscore (_) or the 
hyphen (-). For example, cat-page.html is a fine filename. Numbers are 
okay in most cases, and capital letters don’t generally matter.
 
The reason for all this fuss? Filenames are especially important in Web sites 
because they’re included in the HTML code when you set links. Links with 
spaces and special characters work just fine when you test pages on a Mac or 
a PC computer, but the software programs used on many of the Web servers 
on the Internet don’t understand spaces or special characters in links. Thus, 
links that don’t follow these rules may get broken when you publish the site to 
a Web server. By following these rules, you ensure that the filename and the 
code in the link match.

37
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
Naming the first page index.html
Another confusing rule, and one of the most important, is that the main page 
(or the front page) of your Web site must be called index.html (on some 
Windows-based servers, the first page should be named default.html). 
That’s because most servers are set up to serve the index.html page 
first.
Essentially, when a Web browser comes to a domain name, such as 
DigitalFamily.com, the first page that opens is index.html. Similarly, when 
a Web browser is directed to a subfolder within a site, it also displays the 
Showing file extensions in Windows
Unless you change the settings, you won’t see 
the file extension of your gifs, jpegs, or html 
pages on a Windows computer (although these 
extensions will be displayed in the Files panel 
in Dreamweaver).
To change these settings, open the Folder 
Options dialog box, as shown in the following 
figure, choose the View tab, and then deselect 
the Hide Extensions for Known File Types option. 
How you open the Folder Options dialog box 
depends on which version of Windows you’re 
using; but if you search for Folder Options in the 
Help section, you can find it easily.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
index page first. As a result, if you create a books subfolder, for example, and 
inside that subfolder you include an index page as the main page, you can tell 
visitors to your site to simply enter www.DigitalFamily.com/books to arrive 
at the books page within your site. If you name the first page anything else, 
such as books.html, visitors have to type www.DigitalFamily.com/books/
books.html to open the page.
The rest of the pages in your site can be named anything you like, as long as 
the names don’t include any spaces or special characters (except the hyphen 
or underscore).
Bestowing a page title
 
When you create new pages, adding a page title right away is also good practice. 
You can add a page title by changing the text in the Title box at the top of the 
workspace. It’s an easy detail to forget, but page titles are important because 
they play a role in the appearance of your site as well as behind the scenes:
 
 The title won’t appear in the main part of your Web page, but it does 
appear at the top of a browser window, usually just to the right or left 
of the name of the browser. Pages on the Web look unfinished when the 
untitled document appears at the top of the browser window.
 
 The page title is also the text that appears in a user’s Favorites or 
Bookmarks list.
 
 Many search engines give special priority to the words that appear in 
the title of a Web page.
Designing Your First Page
Many people are pleasantly surprised by how easily they can create a basic 
Web page in Dreamweaver.
If you’re ready to plunge right in, create a page and click to insert your 
cursor at the top of the blank page. (See the previous section, “Creating New 
Pages,” if you need to start from the beginning.) Type some text on the page, 
anything you like; you just need something to get started. In the example 
in Figure 2-6 (a little later in this chapter), I typed the text “I gotcha where I 
want ya.” I’ll use this as a headline in the simple page I’m creating to go with 
my lion photo.

39
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
In this chapter, I use a mix of CSS and HTML formatting options, although I 
mostly use HTML. In Chapter 5, you find more detailed instructions for creat-
ing CSS to control and manage formatting.
Formatting headlines with 
the heading tags
One of the best formatting options for headlines is the collection of heading 
tags. In HTML, there are many advantages to using heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, 
and so forth) to format text that serves as a title or headline. That’s because 
heading tags are designed to be displayed in relative sizes, with <h1> the 
largest, <h2> smaller, <h3> smaller still, and so on through <h6>. That’s 
valuable because no matter what the default text size is for a Web page (and 
text sizes can vary because of things like browser settings and computer 
platform), any text formatted with an <h1> tag is always larger than text 
formatted with <h2>.
 
Many search engines also give priority to keywords in text formatted with 
an <h1> tag because that tag is perceived to be the most important text on a 
page.
To format text with a heading tag, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the text you want to format.
 
2. In the Property inspector, at the bottom of the workspace, make sure 
the HTML button on the left side of the inspector is selected.
 
3. Use the Format drop-down list to select a heading option (see Figure 2-6).
 
 When heading tags are applied, the text automatically changes to dis-
play the heading’s formatting options in design view.
 
In general, I find the Property inspector the easiest way to apply basic format-
ting, but you can also find these HTML formatting options under the Format 
drop-down list.
Adding paragraphs and line breaks
When you create page designs for the Web, you must work within many 
limitations that may seem confusing at first. Web design and print design 
are fundamentally different, and that can make even seemingly simple tasks 
more complicated than you might expect. How you create paragraph and line 
breaks is a good example.

With HTML 
selected, 
the Property 
inspector

to com-
mon HTML

features, 
such as the 
heading 
tags.
 
If you’re working in design view in Dreamweaver and press the Enter key 
(Windows) or the Return key (Mac), Dreamweaver inserts a paragraph tag, 
or <p>, in the code, which creates a line break followed by a blank line. If you 
want a line break without the extra blank line, hold down the Shift key while 
you press Enter (or Return) to get Dreamweaver to insert the <br /> tag 
into the code, creating a single line break.
If you want to add a lot of space, you’re best option is to use CSS to create a 
page layout with the spacing and alignment options you desire. (I cover CSS 
in Chapters 5 and 6.)
 
If you’re working in code view and add space using the Enter or Return key, 
you add blank space within the code. Extra space in HTML code can be useful 
because extra space can make code easier to read, but it doesn’t affect the 
way a page displays in design view or in a Web browser.
Inserting text from another program
Dreamweaver gives you many options to maintain formatting when you 
copy and paste text from another program. You can change the default 

41
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
for how Dreamweaver handles formatting when you choose Edit➪Paste 
and alter the Preferences in the Copy/Paste category. And you can choose 
Edit➪Paste Special to have all the options available each time you paste 
new content. Here are your four main options (and two ways to refine your 
choice):
 
 Text Only: Dreamweaver strips any formatting and inserts plain text.
 
 Text with Structure: Dreamweaver includes paragraphs, lists, tables, 
and other structural formatting options.
 
 Text with Structure Plus Basic Formatting: Dreamweaver includes 
structural formatting as well as basic formatting, such as bold and
italic.
 
 Text with Structure Plus Full Formatting: In addition to the previous 
options, Dreamweaver includes formatting created by style sheets in 
programs, such as Microsoft Word.
 
 Retain Line Breaks: Line breaks are preserved, even if you don’t keep 
other formatting options.
 
 Clean Up Word Paragraph Spacing: This option addresses a common 
problem with the way Microsoft Word’s paragraph spacing is converted 
when content is pasted into an HTML file.
I cover formatting text in Chapter 5 because you need to understand some 
basics about CSS to best format text in a Web site. You find instructions for 
adding other content, such as images and links, to your page, in the upcom-
ing sections.
Adding images
Now for the fun part. Adding an image to your Web page may seem almost 
magical at first because it’s so simple with Dreamweaver. The challenge with 
Web graphics isn’t adding them to your pages but creating good-looking 
images that load quickly in your viewer’s browser. You need another pro-
gram, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, to create, convert, and edit images. 
Dreamweaver just lets you place the images on your page.
For more information on finding and creating images, as well as keeping file 
sizes small, see Chapter 3. For now, I assume that you have a GIF or a JPEG 
image file ready and that you want to insert your image into your page. The 
two most common image formats you can use on your Web page are GIF and 
JPEG (which is often shortened to JPG), but the PNG file is increasingly used 
today because it’s superior to the GIF format. Warning: PNG isn’t fully sup-
ported in very old versions of some Web browsers. For the exercise that fol-
lows, you can use any image in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format.

42
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
If you don’t have an image handy, you can download free images from my Web 
site at www.DigitalFamily.com/free. (You find instructions for down-
loading the free images on the site.)
Before inserting an image into a Web page, it’s good practice to save the 
image inside your local root folder (the one you should have identified in the 
site definition process described in the “Defining a Web site in Dreamweaver” 
section, earlier in this chapter). Saving your image in your Web site’s local 
root folder is important because you need to keep Web pages and images 
in the same location relative to each other in your Web site, or you risk 
broken image links when you publish your site to a server. Whether you 
save your images in an images folder or in any other place in the root folder 
is up to you, but it’s common practice to save images in a folder called 
images.
If you insert an image into a page and the image isn’t saved in the local 
root folder, Dreamweaver copies the image into the root folder of your site 
(directly into the images folder if you identified one during the site definition 
process). This happens automatically as Dreamweaver inserts the image into 
the page and the original image is left unchanged. 
Many designers create an images folder so they can keep all their image files 
in one place. If you’re working on a very large site, you may want to create 
multiple image folders to better organize your files.
 
To avoid breaking links or image references, always use the Files panel to 
move or rename files. When you do so, Dreamweaver automatically fixes 
the links. If you move or rename a file or folder outside Dreamweaver, the 
links break. You find more detailed instructions on testing and fixing links in 
Chapter 4.
Why can’t I place images anywhere I want them?
You can’t just place your cursor anywhere on 
a page and insert an image where you want 
it. This isn’t a limitation of Dreamweaver; it’s a 
restriction caused by how HTML is displayed on 
the Web.
By default, all images, text, and other elements 
are inserted starting at the top-left corner of the 
browser window. To create more complex lay-
outs and position images precisely on a page, 
you’re best option is to create a layout with CSS 
(which I cover in Chapter 6). You can also use 
an HTML table to position elements on a Web 
page (which I cover in Chapter 7).

43
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
Okay, assuming you’ve saved your page and the image you want to insert 
into your page is saved within your main root site folder (or you’re ready to 
let Dreamweaver copy an image that is saved on your hard drive into your 
local root folder for you), you’re ready for the easy part. Follow these steps 
to add an image on your Web page:
 
1. Place your cursor on the page where you want to add the image.
 
 I inserted my cursor under the headline at the beginning of the first 
paragraph.
 
2. Double-click the Insert panel at the top right of the workspace to 
open it.
 
 Note: The location of the Insert panel varies depending on the 
Workspace layout you’ve selected. These instructions assume you’re 
using the designer layout option, which is the default when you first 
start Dreamweaver. Choose Window➪Workspace Layout and then 
choose Designer to restore these default settings.
 
3. Click the Images icon, located in the Common section of the Insert 
panel or click the small arrow to the right of the icon and then choose 
Image from the drop-down list.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box opens, displaying files and folders 
on your hard drive.
 
4. Navigate to the folder that has the image you want to insert and 
double-click to select the image you want to insert into your page.
 
5. Enter alternate text in the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box.
 
 If you have Accessibility options turned on in Preferences (the default), 
the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears. It’s good 
practice to always add alternate text in this dialog box. To do so, simply 
enter text in the Alternate Text field. You can type any text in this field; 
it’s meant to provide a description of the image. Alternate text won’t 
appear on your Web page unless the image isn’t visible, but it will 
appear in Internet Explorer when a user holds the cursor over the image. 
Alternate text is also important for Web surfers who use screen readers, 
or browsers that “read” Web pages to them, such as those with limited 
vision. For this reason, alternate text is required for accessibility compli-
ance. A long description is considered optional under most accessibil-
ity guidelines. You can enter the address of a Web page with a longer 
description of the image in this field. You can also add or edit alternate 
text in the Property inspector after clicking to select the inserted image.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The image automatically appears on the Web page.

44
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
7. Click to select the image on your Web page.
 
 Image options are displayed automatically in the Property inspector at 
the bottom of the page.
 
8. Use the Property inspector to specify image attributes, such as align-
ment, spacing, and alternate text.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 2-7, I set the alignment to Right, using 
the Align option at the very bottom right of the Property inspector. 
That’s how I got the text to wrap to the left of the image. I’ve also added 
ten pixels of space with the H Space field to create a margin between the 
image and the text.
 
CSS makes it possible to create more precise formatting options. For example, 
H Space inserts space on both the left and right sides of an image. With CSS, 
you can create a style that applies margin space on any or all sides of an 
image.
With an image selected, the Property inspector enables you to specify many 
attributes for an image. Table 2-1 describes those attributes. If you don’t see 
all the attributes listed in the table on your screen, click the triangle in the 
bottom-right corner of the Property inspector to expand the inspector and 
reveal all the image options.

Although you can resize an image in Dreamweaver by clicking and dragging 
the edge of the image or by changing the Height and Width values in the 
Property inspector, I don’t recommend you change an image size this way. 
Changing the height and width in the Property inspector doesn’t actually 
change the size of the image, just the way it appears on the page. That’s a 
problem for two reasons. First, using this option to make an image look larger 
or smaller can make the image look distorted. Second, using this option to 
make an image look smaller requires your visitor to download a larger file 

47
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
Creating multiple pages to set links
Creating a new page to start a Web site may 
seem obvious but consider this: You may want 
to create a bunch of new pages before you get 
too far in your development, and you may even 
want to start organizing the new pages in sub-
directories before you have anything on them. 
Doing so enables you to organize the structure 
of your site before you start setting links. After 
all, you can’t link to a page that doesn’t exist. If 
you plan to have five links on your front page to 
other pages in your site, go ahead and create 
those other pages, even if you don’t put any-
thing on them yet.
For example, say you’re creating a site for your 
department at a big company. You’re likely to 
want a few main pages, such as a page about 
your staff, another page about what you do, 
and a third page with general information and 
resources. At this initial stage, you could create 
four pages — one for the front page of the site 
and three others for each of the subsections. 
Name the front page index.html and name 
the other pages staff.html, about.
html, and general.html. With these initial 
pages in place, you benefit from having an early 
plan for organizing the site, and you can start 
setting links more easily among the main pages 
of your site. See Chapter 4 for more tips on Web 
site planning and managing and testing links.
than necessary. If you do resize an image in Dreamweaver, a small circular 
icon appears to the right of the height and width fields. Click this icon, and 
Dreamweaver alters the HTML to return the image display to the actual size.
Setting Links
Dreamweaver is truly a dream when it comes to setting links. The most 
important thing to keep in mind is that a link is essentially an address (a URL) 
that tells a viewer’s browser what page to go to when the viewer clicks the 
text or image containing the link.
To link to a page within your Web site, you can create a relative link that 
includes a path describing how to get from the current page to the linked 
page within your main root folder. A relative link doesn’t need to include 
the domain name of the site, just instructions for a browser to get from 
one page within your site to another. Here’s an example of what the code 
looks like for the relative link from the home page on my Web site at www.
DigitalFamily.com to the Dreamweaver page in the books section, which 
is contained in a books folder:
<A HREF=”books/dreamweaver.html”>Dreamweaver Books</A>

48
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
If you select the Root option instead of Relative in the Site Definition dialog 
box, this address would begin with a forward slash (as you see here) instruct-
ing the browser to begin at the root level:
<A HREF=”/books/dreamweaver.html”>Dreamweaver Books</A>
If you link to a page on a different Web site, create an absolute, or external, 
link. An absolute link includes the full Internet address of the other site. 
Here’s an example of what the code would look like behind an absolute link 
if you created a link from your site to the Dreamweaver page in my books 
section:
<A HREF=”http://www.digitalfamily.com/books/
dreamweaver.html”>Janine’s Books</A>
If all that HREF code stuff looks like Greek to you, don’t worry. The follow-
ing section shows you how Dreamweaver sets links like this for you so you 
don’t even have to look at this code if you don’t want to. (I include these 
tips because I think it’s helpful to have a little understanding of what’s 
happening behind the scenes.)
Linking pages within your Web site
Linking from one page to another page in your Web site is easy. The most 
important thing to remember is to save your pages in your site’s root folder 
(as described in the “Defining a Web site in Dreamweaver” section, previ-
ously in the chapter) before you start setting links. Here’s how you create a 
link from one page in a Web site to another:
 
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page where you want to create a link.
 
2. Select the text or image that you want to serve as the link (meaning 
the text or image that a user licks to trigger the link).
 
 Click and drag to highlight text or click once to select an image. In this 
example, I selected the photo of the lion and I linked it to a page named 
prey.html located in the same folder.
 
 
3. Click the Hyperlink icon in the Common Insert panel, at the top right 
of the workspace.
 
 Alternatively, you can set a link by clicking the Browse button (the 
icon that looks like a file folder) just to the right of the Link field in the 
Property inspector.

49
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
 And yet another alternative, you can click the Point to File icon (which 
looks like a circle with a dot in the middle) and then drag your cursor 
over the name of any file in the Files panel. When you click and drag, 
Dreamweaver extends a line from the link field to the file in the Files 
panel. Note, the file must be visible in the Files panel, thus you may 
need to open a subfolder to reveal the file before you can set a link 
this way.
 
 
4. In the Hyperlink dialog box (see Figure 2-8), click the Browse icon to 
the right of the Link drop-down list.
 
 The Select File dialog box opens.
 
Figure 2-8: 
The 
Hyperlink 
dialog box 
includes a 
number of 
link settings 
not avail-
able from 
the Property 
inspector, 
including 
Target 
options and 
accessibility 
settings.
 
 
5. Click the filename to select the page that you want your image or text 
to link to, and then click OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac). 
 
 The link is set automatically, and the dialog box closes. Note that to 
test your links, you have to view your page in a browser, a process I 
cover in the “Previewing Your Page in a Browser” section, later in this 
chapter.
 
You can use the Target field in the Hyperlink dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-8, 
to “target” where your linked page opens. For example, the _blank option causes 
the linked page to open in a new browser window. The other options are most 
important when working with frames, which I cover in Chapter 8.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Setting links to named anchors 
within a page
Setting links to named anchors makes it possible to link to elements within 
the same page. A named anchor link is an HTML tag that can be inserted 
anywhere on a page to add a Name, which can serve as a target for a link. 
You can use a named anchor to link from an image or a text string on one 
page to another place on the same page, or to link from one page to a specific 
part of a different page. To create a named anchor link, sometimes called a 
jump link, first insert a named anchor in the place that you want to link to 
and then include that anchor in the link to direct the browser to that specific 
part of the page when a viewer follows the link.
Suppose that you want to set a link from the word Tigers at the top of a 
page to a section lower on the page that starts with the headline Lions are 
Cooler than Tigers. First insert a named anchor at the Lions are Cooler than 
Tigers headline and then link the word Tigers from the top of the page to that 
anchor.
To insert a named anchor and set a link to it, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page on which you want to insert the named anchor.
 
2. Place your cursor next to the word or image that you want to link to 
on the page.
 
 You don’t need to select the word or image; you just need a refer-
ence point that appears when the link is selected. For this example, 
I placed the cursor to the left of the headline Lions are Cooler than 
Tigers.
 
3. Choose Insert➪Named Anchor.
 
 The Insert Named Anchor dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter a name for the anchor.
 
 You can name anchors anything you want (as long as you don’t use 
spaces or special characters). Just make sure that you use a different 
name for each anchor on the same page. Then be sure that you remem-
ber what you called the anchor because you have to either type the 
anchor name to set the link or select it from the drop-down list in the 
Hyperlink dialog box, as you see in Step 8. In this example, I chose tiger 
as the anchor name because it’s easy for me to remember.

51
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and a small anchor icon appears on the page 
where you inserted the anchor name. You can move an anchor name 
by clicking the anchor icon and dragging it to another location on the 
page.
 
 If you’re curious about what this named anchor looks like in HTML, 
here’s the code that appears before the headline in my example:
<A NAME=”tiger” id=”tiger”></A>
 
 Remember that Dreamweaver creates XHTML code, which is a strict 
version of HTML and requires that all code be in lowercase letters.
 
6. To set a link to the named anchor location, select the text or image 
that you want to link from.
 
 You can link to a named anchor from anywhere else on the same page 
or from another page. In my example, I linked from the word Tiger 
that appears at the top of the page to the anchor I made next to the 
headline.
 
 
7. Click the Link icon in the Common Insert panel, at the top right of the 
workspace.
 
8. In the Hyperlink dialog box, use the small arrow to the right of the 
Link box to select the anchor.
 
 Alternatively, you can set a jump link by using the Property inspector 
by typing a pound sign (#) followed by the anchor name.
 
 
 You can also select the text and drag a line from the Point to File 
icon (next to the Link text box) to the anchor icon. The anchor name 
automatically appears in the Link box, saving you from typing the 
name.
 
 In my example, I typed #tiger in the Link text box. The HTML code for 
this line looks like this:
<A HREF=”#tiger”>Tiger</A>
 
 If you want to link to an anchor named tiger on another page with 
the filename coolcats.html, type coolcats.html#tiger in the Link 
text box.
Linking to another Web site
Linking to a page on another Web site — called an external link — is even 
easier than linking to an internal link. All you need is the URL of the page to 
which you want to link, and you’re most of the way there.

52
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To create an external link, follow these steps:
 
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page from which you want to link.
 
2. Select the text or image that you want to act as a link.
 
3. In the Link text box in the Property inspector, type the URL of the 
page you want your text or image to link to.
 
 The link is set automatically. In the example in Figure 2-9, I created a link 
using the text San Diego Wild Animal Page to link to the park’s Web site 
at www.sandiegozoo.org.
 
Although, you don’t have to type the http:// or even the www. at the begin-
ning of a Web site address to get to a site in most browsers, you must always 
use the full URL, including the http://, when you create a link to another 
Web site in HTML. Otherwise, the browser can’t find the correct external site 
address, and the visitor will probably end up on an error page.
Setting a link to an e-mail address
Another common link option goes to an e-mail address. Visitors can send you 
messages easily with e-mail links. I always recommend that you invite visitors 
to contact you because they can point out mistakes in your site and give you 
valuable feedback about how you can further develop your site.Setting a link 
to an e-mail address is just as easy as setting a link to another Web page. All 
you need to know is the e-mail address you want to link to and what text or 
image you want to use when you set the link.
 
 To create an e-mail link, select the text you want to link and then click the 
E-mail Link icon in the Common Insert panel. In the E-mail Link dialog box, 
enter the e-mail address in the Link field and then click OK. If you want to use 
an image as an e-mail link, you must select the image in the main work area 
and then enter the e-mail link into the Link field of the Property inspector.
When you create an e-mail link with the Link field in the Property inspector, 
the e-mail links must begin with the code mailto: (no //). For example, if 
you typed a link to my e-mail address into the Property inspector, you’d need 
to type mailto:janine@jcwarner.com. Here’s what the full line of code behind 
that e-mail link would look like:
<A HREF=”mailto:janine@jcwarner.com”>Send a message to 
Janine</A>

53
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
Figure 2-9: 
To set a link 
to another 
Web site, 
highlight 
the text or 
image you 
want to link 
and type 
the URL in 
the Link text 
box.
 
 
When visitors to your Web site click an e-mail link, their computer systems 
automatically launch their e-mail program and create a blank e-mail message 
to the specified e-mail address. This is a cool trick, but it can be disconcerting 
to your users if they don’t expect it to happen, and it won’t work if they don’t 
have e-mail programs on their computers. That’s why I always try to let users 
know when I use an e-mail link. For example, instead of just linking the words 
Contact Janine, I link the words E-mail Janine. Even better, I often link the 
actual e-mail address.
 
When you create an e-mail link on a Web page that will be displayed on the 
public Internet, you open yourself to spammers, some of whom use automated 
programs to “lift” e-mail addresses off Web pages.
 
Spam is the reason many sites don’t include e-mail links, but instead use text, 
such as Send e-mail to Janine at jcwarner.com. Another alternative is to use 
the AddressMunger Web site to create e-mail links that include special code 
to hide them from spammers. Visit www.AddressMunger.com to read more. 
You can also use a form to get around this potential problem. By setting up 
a form with a script that delivers the form’s contents to an e-mail address, 
you can shield your e-mail address from spammers while still making it easy 
for visitors to your site to send comments. You find instructions for creating 
forms in Chapter 12.

Changing Page Properties
You can change many individual elements on a page in the Property inspec-
tor, but if you want to make changes that affect the entire page, such as 
changing the background color of the entire page or changing the way links 
and text are formatted, use the Page Properties dialog box.
As shown in Figure 2-10, the Page Properties dialog box includes a list of cat-
egories on the left. Each of these reveals different options for specifying page 
settings. Some of these options are covered in other parts of the book, such 
as the Tracing Image feature (Chapter 9), and the Background Image feature 
(Chapter 3).
For now, to keep things simple, this section focuses only on changing the 
background and the text colors available from the Appearance categories, as 
shown in Figure 2-10, and the options in the Links (CSS) category. Note that 
the CSS options are recommended over HTML options. When you use the 
Appearance (CSS) options, Dreamweaver automatically creates correspond-
ing styles for the Body tag.
 
Figure 2-10: 
The 
Appearance 
(CSS) cat-
egory in 
the Page 
Properties 
dialog box 
enables you 
to specify 
the text 
color, font 
face, font 
size, back-
ground, and 
margins.
 
 
Although you can apply global settings, such as text size and color, in the 
Page Properties dialog box, you can override those settings with other format-
ting options in specific instances. For example, you could set all your text to 
Helvetica in Page Properties and then change the font for an individual head-
line to Arial with the Font field in the Property inspector.

55
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
To change the font settings, the background and text colors, and the page 
margins for an entire page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
 
 The Appearance (CSS) category of the Page Properties dialog box 
appears (see Figure 2-10).
 
2. In the Page Font drop-down list, specify the fonts you want for the text 
on your page.
 
 In this example, I set the font face to the collection that begins with the 
Georgia font. If you don’t specify a font, your text appears in the font 
specified in your user’s browser, which is usually Times.
 
3. If you want all the text on your page to appear bold or italic, click the 
B or I, respectively, to the right of the Page Font drop-down list.
 
 If you select one of these options, all your text appears bold or italic in 
the page.
 
4. In the Size drop-down list, specify the font size you want for the text 
on your page.
 
 Again, you can override these settings for any text on the page.
 
5. Click the Text Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. Choose 
any color you like.
 
 The color you select fills the color swatch box but won’t change the text 
color on your page until you click the Apply or OK button.
 
6. Click the Background Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. 
Choose any color you like.
 
 The color you selected fills the color swatch box. The color doesn’t fill 
the background until you click the Apply or OK button.
 
7. If you want to insert a graphic or photograph into the background of 
your page, click the Browse button next to the Background Image box 
and select the image in the Select Image Source dialog box.
 
 When you insert a background image, it automatically repeats or tiles 
across and down the page unless you choose the No-Repeat option from 
the Repeat drop-down list or use CSS to further define the display.
 
8. Use the margin options at the bottom of the dialog box to change the 
left, right, top, or bottom margins of your page.
 
 Entering 0 in all four of these fields removes the default margin settings 
that automatically add margin space at the top and left of a Web page, 
enabling you to create designs that begin flush with the edge of a browser.
 
9. Click the Apply button to see how the colors look on your page.
 
10. Click OK to finish and close the Page Properties dialog box.

56
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
When you change the background, text, or link colors, make sure the colors 
look good together and that your text is still readable. As a general rule, a light 
background color works best with dark text color and vice versa.
To change the link color and underline options, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
 
 The Page Properties dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Category list, select the Links (CSS) option.
 
 The Links (CSS) category is displayed, as shown in Figure 2-11.
 
Figure 2-11: 
The Links 
(CSS) 
category 
enables you 
to change 
link colors, 
font face, 
and size, as 
well as to 
alter the dis-
play of the 
underlined 
or linked 
text.
 
 
3. Specify the font face and size you want for the links on your page.
 
 If you don’t specify a font, your links appear in the same font and 
size specified for the text of your document.
 
4. To the right of the Link Font drop-down list, click the B or I if you  
want all the links on your page to appear bold or italic, respectively.
 
 If you select one of these options, all your links appear bold or italic 
unless you specify other formatting in the page.
 
5. Specify a color for any or all link states.
 
 The color you selected is applied to links on your page based on the 
link state. There are four link states, and all can be displayed in the 
same or different colors:
 
• Link Color: This option controls the color in which a link appears 
when it is first displayed on a page.

57
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
• Visited Links: This option controls the color of links that a visitor 
has already clicked (or visited).
 
• Rollover Links: A link changes to this color when a user rolls a 
cursor over the link (also known as hovering).
 
• Active Links: A link changes to this color briefly while a user is 
actively clicking it.
 
6. In the Underline Style drop-down list, specify whether you want your 
links underlined.
 
 By default, all links on a Web page appear underlined in a browser, 
but many designers find the underline distracting and prefer to turn 
off underlining by selecting Never Underline. You can also choose 
Show Underline Only on Rollover to make the underline appear when 
a user moves a cursor over a link. Hide Underline on Rollover causes 
the underline to disappear when a user moves a cursor over a link.
 
7. Click the Apply button to see your changes automatically applied to 
any linked text or other elements on your page.
 
8. Click OK to finish and close the Page Properties dialog box.
 
When you change the link options and other settings in the Page Properties 
dialog box, Dreamweaver automatically creates styles corresponding 
to these settings and saves them in the CSS Styles panel, as shown in 
Figure 2-12. I cover Dreamweaver’s CSS Styles panel in greater detail in 
Chapters 5 and 6.

Adding Meta Tags for Search Engines
If you’ve heard of Meta tags, you probably associate them with search 
engines, and you’d be right. Meta tags are used for a variety of things, but 
one of the most common uses is to provide special text that doesn’t appear 
on your page but is read by crawlers, bots, and other programs that scour 
the Web cataloging and ranking Web pages for Yahoo!, Google, and a long list 
of other search-related sites.
Some search engines read the Meta tags for keywords and descriptions. The 
first enables site designers to include a list of keywords they would like used 
to make their Web site a match when someone types the same keywords into 
a search engine. Unfortunately, Meta keywords have been so abused by Web 
designers attempting to mislead visitors about the true content of their Web 
pages that most search engines ignore the Meta keyword tag. Some search 
engines continue to recognize Meta keywords, however, and it won’t hurt 
your ranking with any search engines if you use this Meta tag.
The Meta description tag is more widely used and is definitely worth using. 
This tag is designed to let you include a written description of your Web site 
and is often used by search engines as the brief description that appears in 
search results pages. If you don’t include your own text in a Meta descrip-
tion tag, many search engines use the first several words that appear on your 
front page or some other collection of text from your page, usually based 
on formatting or placement on the page. Depending on your design, the first 
few words may not be the best description of your site, and you’ll be better 
served by including your own Meta description.
Follow these steps to fill in the Meta description tag:
 
1. Open the page where you want to add a Meta description.
 
 You can use Meta descriptions on any or all pages on your Web site. 
(Many people using search engines to find your site may end up directly 
at internal pages if the content matches the search.)
 
2. Choose Insert➪HTML➪Head Tags➪Description, as shown in 
Figure 2-13.
 
 The Description dialog box appears.
 
3. In the Description text box, enter the text you want for your page 
description.
 
 Don’t add any HTML to the text in this box.

59
 Chapter 2: Opening and Creating Sites
 
Figure 2-13:

search 
engines

entered into 
the Meta 
description 
field as the

tion of your 
Web page 
in search 
results.
 
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The description text you entered is inserted into the Head area at the 
top of the page in the HTML code. Meta content doesn’t appear in the 
body of the page.
If you want to add keywords, repeat Steps 1–4, choosing Insert➪HTML➪Head 
Tags➪Keywords in Step 2.
Previewing Your Page in a Browser
Although Dreamweaver displays Web pages much like a Web browser, not all 
interactive features work in Dreamweaver. To test links, for example, preview 
your work in a Web browser.
 
The simplest way to preview your work is to save the page you’re working on 
and then click the Preview/Debug in Browser icon located at the top right of 
the workspace, as shown in Figure 2-14 (it looks like a small globe). You can 
also choose File➪Preview in a Browser.

60
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
When you install Dreamweaver, it automatically finds all the browsers 
installed on your computer and sets them up so that you can easily select 
them to preview your pages. It’s always a good practice to test your pages 
in more than one Web browser because page display can vary. How many 
browsers you test your pages on depends on the audience you expect to visit 
your Web site, but most good Web designers test their pages on at least the 
latest two or three versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox. It’s also good 
practice to preview your pages on both Macintosh and Windows computers 
because the page display might differ.
If you install more browsers on your computer, you can add 
them to the Browser Preview list by choosing Edit➪Preferences 
(Dreamweaver➪Preferences on a Mac) and then choosing Preview in 
Browser from the Category list. Click the plus sign at the top of the screen 
to add a browser and then navigate your hard drive to select the installed 
browser to add to the list. Alternatively, you can click the globe icon at the 
top of the workspace, as shown in Figure 2-14 and choose Edit Browser List.

o matter how great the writing may be on your Web site, the graph-
ics always get people’s attention first. The key to making a good first 
impression is to use images that look great, download quickly, and are a good 
fit with the design of your Web site.
If you’re familiar with using a graphics-editing program, such as Adobe 
Photoshop or Fireworks, to create graphics for the Web, you’re a step ahead. 
If not, you find pointers throughout this chapter on how to convert images 
for the Web, what image formats to use, and how to optimize images for 
faster download times.
If your images are already in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format and ready for the Web, 
you can jump ahead to the “Inserting Images in Dreamweaver” section, where 
you find out how to place and align images, create image maps, and use an 
image as a background. You also discover some of Dreamweaver’s built-in 
image-editing features, which enable you to crop images and even adjust 
contrast and brightness without ever launching an external image-editing 
program.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Creating and Optimizing Web Graphics
The most important thing to keep in mind when creating images for the Web 
is that you want to optimize your images to make your file sizes as small as 
possible so that they download as quickly as possible.
Comparing Adobe Web graphics programs
Most professional designers strongly prefer 
Adobe Photoshop, although I have to say I’ve 
been impressed with Photoshop Elements, 
which is a “light” version but offers many of 
the same features for a fraction of the cost. The 
following is a list of some of the most popular 
image-editing programs on the market today. 
All these image programs are available for both 
Mac and Windows:
  Adobe Fireworks (www.adobe.com/
fireworks): Fireworks was one of the 
first image-editing programs designed to 
create and edit Web graphics. Originally 
created by Macromedia, the program is 
now part of the Adobe Web Suite and is fully 
integrated with Dreamweaver. Fireworks 
gives you everything you need to create, 
edit, and output Web graphics, all in one 
well-designed product. Although Fireworks 
lacks many of the advanced image-editing 
capabilities of Photoshop, it shines when 
creating Web graphics, and is especially 
popular among Web designers who rave 
about the ability to create a design in 
Fireworks that can easily be sliced and re-
created in Dreamweaver.
  Adobe Photoshop (www.adobe.com/
photoshop): By far the most popular 
image-editing program on the market, 
Photoshop is a widely used standard among 
graphics professionals. With Photoshop, 
you can create original artwork, edit and 
enhance photographs, and so much more. 
Photoshop has a wealth of powerful paint-
ing and selection tools in addition to special 
effects and filters that can be used to create 
images that go far beyond what you can 
capture on film or create with many other 
illustration programs. In previous versions, 
Photoshop came bundled with a program 
called Image Ready, a companion program 
designed for Web graphics. In CS3, those 
Web features were included in Photoshop; 
and in CS4, they’ve been enhanced, making 
it easier than ever to go back and forth 
between Photoshop and Dreamweaver.
  Adobe Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.
com/elements): If you don’t need all the 
bells and whistles offered in the full-blown 
version of Photoshop, Photoshop Elements 
is a remarkably powerful program — for 
about a sixth of the price. If you’re a pro-
fessional designer, you’re best served by 
Photoshop CS4. But if you’re a hobbyist or 
small business owner and want to create 
good-looking images without the high cost 
and learning curve of a professional graph-
ics program, Elements is a great deal and 
well-suited to creating Web graphics.
If you have an Internet connection and want 
to do basic image editing for free, visit www.
photoshop.com/express where you 
can use a free online version of Photoshop 
Elements.

63
 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
How you optimize an image depends on how the image was created and 
whether you want to save it as a JPEG, PNG or GIF. You find instructions for 
optimizing images with Photoshop in the sections that follow, but the bottom 
line is this: No matter what program, format, or optimization technique you 
choose, your biggest challenge is finding the best balance between small file 
size and good image quality. Essentially, the more you optimize, the faster 
the image will download, but the compression and color reduction tech-
niques used to optimize images can make them look terrible.
You can optimize images using compression techniques or color reduction 
and you can further reduce file size by reducing the physical size of an image. 
As a general rule, do any editing, such as adjusting contrast, retouching, or 
combining images before you reduce their size or optimize them because you 
want to work with the highest resolution possible when you’re editing. Also, 
resize an image before you optimize it. You find instructions for resizing an 
image in the next exercise and instructions for optimizing in the sections that 
follow.
Resizing graphics and photos
Resizing images is important for two reasons: Your photos and graphics must 
be small enough to display well on a computer monitor. The smaller you 
make them, the more you reduce the file size and the faster your images will 
download to a user’s computer.
 
Although you can change the display size of an image by altering the height 
and width settings in the Property inspector in Dreamweaver, you get much 
better results if you change the physical size of the image in an image editor 
instead. That’s because when you alter the height and width in the HTML 
code, you simply instruct a Web browser to display the image in a different 
size. If you set the image larger, the image is likely to look fuzzy or distorted 
because not enough pixels are in the image for all the details to look good 
when the image is displayed larger than its actual size. If you set the code to 
display the image smaller than it is, you’re requiring that your users download 
an image that’s larger than necessary.
To enlarge or reduce the dimensions of an image, change the image size. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. With an image open in Photoshop, choose Image➪Resize.
 
 If you don’t want your original image to lose quality, make a copy of it 
and resize the copy for your Web site.
 
2. In the Image Size dialog box, specify a height and width for the image.
 
 As shown in Figure 3-1, I’m reducing the size of this image to 200 pixels 
wide.

64
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 The Image Size dialog box can be confusing at first because it has mul-
tiple options for changing image size and resolution. A simple strategy 
is to use the fields in the Pixel Dimensions area, at the top of the dialog 
box. With these options, you can alter the height and width of an image 
to a specified size in pixels or enlarge or reduce the image by any per-
centage, as shown in the drop-down list in Figure 3-1. (Note: Make sure 
Scale Styles, Constrain Proportions, and Resample Image are all selected 
at the bottom of the dialog box.)
 
 If you’ve checked the Constrain Proportions check box at the bottom 
of the dialog box in Elements, any changes you make to the height auto-
matically affect the width (and vice versa) to ensure that the image pro-
portions remain constant even if the height or width is altered.
 
3. Click OK to resize the image.
 
 If you want to return the image to its previous size, choose Edit➪Undo. 
Beware, after you save the image, the changes become permanent.
 
Most Web designers limit the resolution of an image to 72 pixels per inch (ppi) 
because that’s all that displays on a computer monitor, and anything higher 
than that means the image is a larger size than necessary for the Web. If the 
image resolution is higher than 72 ppi, Photoshop automatically reduces the 
resolution when you use the Save for Web features, covered in the sections 
that follow.
 
Figure 3-1: 
When you 
resize an

Dimensions 
area, you

the original 
size.

 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
Choosing the best image format
One of the most common questions about images for the Web concerns when to 
use GIF or PNG and when to use JPEG. Table 3-1 provides the simple answer.
Table 3-1 
Image Formats for the Web
Format
Best Use
GIF
For line art (such as one- or two-color logos), simple draw-
ings, animations, and basically any image that has no gradi-
ents or blends. GIF is also the best format for images that you 
want displayed with a transparent background.
PNG
PNG generally produces better-looking images with smaller 
file sizes than GIF for the same kinds of limited-color images. 
Just beware that really old browsers, such as IE 3, don’t sup-
port the PNG format and that even newer browsers, such 
as IE 4, 5, and 6, have problems with full PNG alpha channel 
support.
JPEG
For colorful, complex images (such as photographs), images 
containing gradients or color blends, and any other images 
with millions of colors.
Saving images for the Web: The basics
If you’re new to saving images for the Web, the following basics can help you 
get the best results from your files, your image-editing program, and ulti-
mately, your Web pages. You can
 
 Convert images from any format into the GIF, PNG, and JPEG formats. 
For example, your TIF, BMP, and PSD image files can all be turned into a 
Web-friendly file format.
 
 Optimize images that are already in GIF, PNG, or JPEG format. This 
further reduces their file sizes for faster download over the Internet.
 
 Use many programs to create Web graphics, but Photoshop is one of the 
best and easiest to use. Under the File menu in Photoshop (and Photoshop 
Elements), you’ll find the Save for Web option. (In Photoshop CS4, the 
option is Save for Web & Devices.) Fireworks provides a similar feature and 
although the dialog boxes are slightly different in each program, the basic 
options for compressing and reducing colors are the same.

66
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 When you use the Save for Web feature, Photoshop creates a new copy 
of your image with the settings you specified and leaves the original 
unchanged in the main Photoshop workspace.
 
 See the upcoming sections “Optimizing JPEG images in Photoshop” and 
“Optimizing GIF and PNG images in Photoshop” for details about using 
the Save for Web feature.
 
 Make image edits before you optimize. It’s always best to use the 
highest quality image possible when you’re editing, so make sure to do 
all your editing, sharpening, and resizing before you use the Save for 
Web option. Similarly, if you want to make further changes to an image 
after you’ve optimized it, you’ll achieve the best results if you go back 
a higher resolution version of the image rather than editing the version 
that’s been optimized for the Web.
Optimizing JPEG images in Photoshop
The JPEG format is the best choice for optimizing continuous-tone images, 
such as photographs and images with many colors or gradients. When you 
optimize a JPEG, you specify how much compression should be applied, a 
process that makes the file size of the image smaller.
If you have a digital photograph or another image that you want to prepare 
for the Web, follow these steps to optimize and save it in Photoshop. If you’re 
using Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, the process is similar although the 
specific steps may vary:
 
1. With the image open in Photoshop, choose File➪Save for Web & 
Devices (or File➪Save for Web).
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. In the top-left corner of the dialog box, choose either 2-Up or 4-Up to 
display multiple versions of the same image for easy side-by-side 
comparison.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 3-2, I chose 2-Up, which makes it pos-
sible to view the original image on the left and a preview of the same 
image as it will appear with the specified settings on the right.
 
3. On the right side of the dialog window, just under Preset, click the 
small arrow to open the Optimized File Format drop-down list and 
choose JPEG (this dialog window is open in Figure 3-2).
 
4. Set the compression quality.
 
 Use the preset options Low, Medium, High, Very High, or Maximum from 
the drop-down list. Or use the slider just under the Quality field to make 

67
 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
more precise adjustments. Lowering the quality reduces the file size and 
makes the image download more quickly, but if you lower this number 
too much, the image will look blurry and blotchy.
 
 Photoshop uses a compression scale of 0 to 100 for JPEGs in this dialog 
window, with 0 the lowest possible quality (the highest amount of 
compression and the smallest file size) and 100 the highest possible 
quality (the least amount of compression and the biggest file size). 
Low, Medium, and High represent compression values of 10, 30, and 60, 
respectively.
 
5. Specify other settings as desired (the compression quality and file 
format are the most important settings).
 
6. Click Save.
 
 The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
 
7. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder in your 
Web site folder.
 
 Photoshop saves the optimized image as a copy of the original and 
leaves the original open in the main Photoshop work area.
Repeat these steps for each image you want to optimize as a JPEG.

Optimizing GIF and PNG 
images in Photoshop
If you’re working with a graphic, such as a logo, cartoon character, or draw-
ing that can be displayed in 256 colors or less, use the GIF or PNG formats 
and reduce the total number of colors used in the image as much as possible 
to reduce the file size. To help make up for the degradation in image quality 
that can happen when colors are removed, GIF and PNG use a dithering trick. 
Dithering involves alternating pixels in a checkerboard-like pattern to create 
subtle color variations, even with a limited color palette. The effect can 
smooth the edges in an image and make it appear that the image uses more 
colors than it does.
To convert an image to a GIF or PNG in Photoshop, follow these steps:
 
1. With the image open in Photoshop, choose File➪Save for Web & 
Devices (or File➪Save for Web).
 
 The Save for Web & Devices dialog box appears.
 
2. In the top-left corner of the dialog box, choose either 2-Up or 4-Up to 
display multiple versions of the same image for easy side-by-side 
comparison.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 3-3, I chose 4-Up, which makes it pos-
sible to view the original image, as well as three different previews of 
the same image as it would appear with the settings specified for each 
preview. In Figure 3-3, you see the same image with four different 
settings.
 
3. On the right side of the dialog window, just under Preset, click the 
small arrow to open the Optimized File Format drop-down list and 
choose either GIF or PNG.
 
4. In the Colors box, select the number of colors, as shown in Figure 3-3.
 
 The fewer colors you use, the smaller the file size and the faster the 
image will download. But be careful, if you reduce the colors too much 
(as I have in the bottom-right preview shown in Figure 3-3), you lose 
details. The ideal number of colors depends on your image; if you go too 
far, your image will look terrible.
 
5. If you want to maintain a transparent area in your image, select the 
Transparency option.
 
 Any area of the image that was transparent when you created the image 
in the editor appears transparent in the preview window. If you don’t 
have a transparent area in your image, this setting has no effect.

 Transparency is a good trick for making text or another part of an image 
appear to float on a Web page. That’s because a transparent background 
doesn’t appear on the Web page. You can select transparency as a back-
ground option in the New File dialog box when you create a new image.
 
6. If you choose Transparency, also specify a Matte color.
 
 Specify a matte color that matches the background your transparent 
image will be set against to ensure that the dithering along the transpar-
ent edge will blend in with the background. If you don’t specify a matte 
color, the transparency is set for a white background, which can cause a 
halo effect if the image is displayed on a colored background.
 
7. Specify other settings as desired.
 
 The remainder of the settings in this dialog box can be left at their 
defaults in Photoshop.
 
8. Click Save.
 
 The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
 
9. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder (or any 
other folder) in your local root folder.
Repeat these steps for each image you want to optimize as a GIF or PNG for 
your site.

Trial and error is a great technique in the Save for Web & Devices dialog box. 
In each of the three preview windows displaying optimized versions of the 
cool sun cartoon image in Figure 3-3, I used fewer and fewer colors, which 
reduced the file size. The version in the top left is the original, which has a file 
size of 257K. Reducing the image to 256 colors dramatically reduced the file 
size to 35K, but made little noticeable change to the image, as you see in the 
top right. In the bottom left, the image is reduced to 32 colors, which brought 
the size down to 14.5K, but still made little change to the image. In the bottom 
right, I reduced it to 2 colors, and although it’s harder to tell in the black-and-
white reproduction in this book, the image quality suffered dramatically and 
the mouth and sunglasses all but disappeared. In this last case, the small sav-
ings in file size are clearly not worth the loss of image quality.
How small is small enough?
After you know how to optimize GIFs and JPEGs and appreciate the goal of 
making them as small as possible, you may ask, “How small is small enough?” 
The answer is mostly subjective, but the following points are good to 
remember:
 
 The larger your graphics files, the longer people have to wait for them 
to download before they can see them. You may have the most beau-
tiful picture of Mount Fuji on the front page of your Web site, but if it 
takes forever to download, most people aren’t patient enough to wait to 
see it.
 
 When you build pages with multiple graphics, you have to consider 
the cumulative download time of all the graphics on the page. Even if 
each individual image is a small file size, they can add up. Unlike most 
things in life, smaller is definitely better on the Web.
 
 Most Web pros consider anything from about 75K to 150K a good 
maximum cumulative size for all the elements on a given page. With 
the increasing popularity of DSL and cable modems, many Web sites are 
starting to become a bit more graphics heavy and go beyond that size 
limit. However, anything over 150K is pushing the limit, especially if you 
expect people with dialup modems (56K and under) to stick around long 
enough to view your pages.
 
To make determining the total file size of the images on your page easy, 
Dreamweaver includes this information in the status bar of the current 
Document window, as shown in Figure 3-4. This number indicates the total file 
size of all the images and HTML on your page as well as the expected down-
load time at a given connection speed. (You can set your own connection 
speed by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed. On a 
Mac, choose Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed.)

Inserting Images in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver makes placing images on your Web pages easy and provides 
a variety of ways to do so, including choosing Insert➪Image, clicking the 
Images icon in the Common Insert panel and selecting an image using the 
Insert image dialog box, or simply clicking an image name in the Files panel 
and dragging it onto the page.
To place an image on a Web page, follow these step-by-step instructions:
 
1. Open an existing page or choose File➪New to create a new page.
 
2. Make sure you save your page before inserting an image by choosing 
File➪Save and saving it to your main site folder.
 
3. Place your cursor where you want to insert the image on the page.
 
 
4. Click the Images icon on the Common Insert panel at the top of 
the work area (the icon looks like a small tree) or choose Insert➪
Image.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.

72
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
5. Browse to locate the image you want to insert.
 
 Depending on the computer system you use, there are different ways to 
preview images as you insert them. Here are three common options:
 
• On a PC with Windows XP, choose Thumbnails from the View 
drop-down list (as shown in Figure 3-5) just to the right of the Look 
In field to display thumbnail versions of all the images in any open 
folder. You can also view a single preview of any selected image in 
the far right of the dialog box.
 
• On a PC with Windows Vista, choose one of the icon options 
(small, medium, large, or extra large) from the View drop-down list 
just to the right of the Look In field to display thumbnail versions 
of all the images in any open folder. You can also view a single pre-
view of any selected image in the far right of the dialog box.
 
• On a Mac, choose the View as Columns option from the top left of 
the dialog, and you can view a single preview of any selected image 
in the far right of the dialog.
 
6. To insert the image, double-click it or click once and then click OK.
 
 The image automatically appears on the page.

 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
 
When you insert an image file onto a page, you create a reference to the image 
from the page. The underlying code looks much like it does when you create 
a link from one page to another and then include the path from the image to 
the page. As a result, if your images and the pages they’re linked to aren’t in 
the same relative location on your hard drive as they are on your server, you 
break the reference to your images and they won’t appear on your pages. 
(Instead, you get that ugly broken Images icon.) The best way to make sure 
that your images and files stay where they’re supposed to in relation to one 
another is to save all your images in your images folder (or any other folder) 
in your local root folder and make sure they’re located in the same folder or 
subfolder on your Web server. You find more information about creating and 
identifying a local root folder at the beginning of Chapter 2.
Aligning an Image with Text Wrapping
After you place an image on your Web page, you may want to align it so that 
text can wrap around it. In this section, you find the steps to do so with basic 
HTML. This option is useful if you want to use the simplest option for aligning 
an image in Dreamweaver and you’re not familiar with using CSS. Before you 
get started, here are a few limitations of the HTML alignment option:
 
 The HTML alignment options enable you to align your images vertically 
or horizontally, but you can’t do both at once to position images on 
either side of a page.
 
 The HTML alignment options don’t really enable you to position images 
in relation to one another or in relation to text with much precision.
The best way to get around this limitation is to use Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS) to create layout and alignment styles to control the positioning of all 
elements on a page. In Chapters 5 and 6, you find instructions for aligning and 
positioning images with CSS, which provides more precise, standards-based 
design options.
To align an image to the right of a page and wrap text around it on the left, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Insert the image immediately to the left of the first line of the text.
 
 
 The easiest way to do this is to place the cursor just before the first 
letter of text; then choose Insert➪Image or click the Images icon in the 
Common Insert panel.
 
 If you want the text to wrap, don’t put spaces or line breaks between the 
image and the text.

74
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
2. Select the image.
 
 The Property inspector changes to display the image attribute options.
 
3. In the Property inspector, choose Right from the Align drop-down list.
 
 The image aligns to the right, and the text automatically wraps around 
it, as shown in Figure 3-6.
To align the image to the left of the page with text wrapping around on the 
right, follow Steps 1 and 2, but choose Left from the Align drop-down list 
instead of Right in Step 3.
 
To prevent text from running against an image, click the image, find V and H 
spacing in the Property inspector, and enter the amount of space you want 
(the space is measured in pixels). Five to ten pixels is usually enough to pre-
vent the text from bumping up against its edge. If you want to add space to 
only one side of an image, it’s a bit more complicated, but you can more pre-
cisely control spacing with CSS using the instructions for aligning images and 
other elements, included in Chapter 5.

Image Editing in Dreamweaver
The image-editing features in Dreamweaver enable you to make minor changes 
to images inside Dreamweaver without opening Fireworks, Photoshop, or any 
other graphics-editing program. These tools, as shown in Figure 3-7, are avail-
able from the Property inspector when an image is selected.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Use the 
image-
editing tools 
to do basic 
image 
editing.
 
Crop
Brightness/Contrast
Sharpen
Before you get carried away editing your images, remember that 
Dreamweaver is primarily a Web page-creation application and isn’t really 
designed to edit graphics. Although these tools can be useful, they shouldn’t 
take the place of doing serious work on your graphics in a graphics applica-
tion, such as Fireworks or Photoshop.
 
When you do use the tools for cropping, adjusting brightness and contrast, 
and sharpening an image, beware that you’re changing the actual image (not 
just a copy of it). Make sure you’re happy with these changes before you save 
the page you’re working on. You can use the Undo feature in Dreamweaver to 
revert back several steps, but after you save the page, you can’t undo changes 
to an image. To protect your original image, save a copy before editing it.
Cropping an image
Essentially, cropping an image is trimming it. To crop a graphic or photo, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to crop by 
clicking it.
 
 The Property inspector changes to display the image’s properties.

76
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
2. Click the Crop icon (see Figure 3-8).
 
 A dialog box appears, warning you that cropping changes the original 
image.
 
 Don’t make the change if you’re concerned about keeping the entire 
image available. If you’re concerned, the best thing to do is to make a 
copy of the image and apply your cropping to the copy.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 A solid crop line with handles at the sides and corners appears over the 
image, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 
4. Click and drag the handles to outline the area of the image you want 
to keep.
 
 Any part of the image outside the crop line (and shaded) is deleted 
when the crop is completed.

 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
 
5. Double-click inside the box or press Enter (Return on a Mac).
 
 The image is cropped.
 
You can undo cropping by choosing Edit➪Undo. However, after you save the 
page, changes permanently apply to the image and can’t be undone.
Adjusting brightness and contrast
Adjusting an image’s brightness allows you to change the overall amount of 
light in an image. Contrast controls the difference between the light and dark 
areas of an image.
 
Using Dreamweaver’s editing tools permanently alters the image when the 
page is saved. If you’re concerned, the best thing to do is to make a copy of 
the image and make your adjustments to the copy.
To adjust brightness and contrast, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to alter.
 
 The Property inspector shows the image properties.
 
2. Click the Brightness and Contrast icon (labeled in Figure 3-7).
 
 A dialog box appears, indicating that the changes you make are made to 
the original file.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The Brightness/Contrast dialog box appears.
 
4. Use the sliders to adjust the brightness and contrast settings of the 
image.
 
 Make sure to select the Preview check box if you want to see how the 
changes affect the image as you move the sliders around.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The settings take effect permanently when you save the page.
Sharpening an image
When you apply sharpening to an image, you increase the distinction between 
areas of color. The effect can be one of increased definition to the shapes and 
lines in an image.

4. Use the slider to adjust the sharpness of the image.
 
 Make sure you select the Preview check box if you want to see how the 
changes affect the image as you move the slider.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The image is sharpened, and changes are made permanently when you 
save changes to the page.
Optimizing images in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver CS4 includes an Edit Image Settings icon that you can use to 
convert an image to the GIF, PNG, or JPEG format as well as optimize it by 
reducing the colors or increasing the compression, much as you can do in 
Photoshop or Fireworks. To use this feature, simply select any image in the 
Dreamweaver workspace and then click the Edit Image Settings icon in the 
Property inspector. (Hint: It looks like a two small gears.)
 
Dreamweaver’s editing tools permanently alter the image when the page is 
saved. If you’re concerned, copy the image and make changes to the copy.
To optimize an image in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to optimize.
 
 The Property inspector shows the image properties.
 
2. Click the Edit Image Setting icon (see Figure 3-7).
 
 A dialog box appears, indicating that your change is made to the 
original file.

79
 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The Image Preview dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-9.
 
4. In the Format drop-down list, select the image format you want.
 
 You can select from GIF, JPEG, or PNG format.
 
5. If you choose JPEG, use the slider that appears when you click the 
arrow next to Quality to select the level of compression. If you choose 
GIF or PNG, choose the number of colors desired.
 
 The image is altered based on the settings you specify.
 
Figure 3-9:

You can also change other settings in the Image Preview dialog box, such as 
transparency settings for the GIF format, much as you would in Photoshop or 
Fireworks.
Opening an image in Photoshop or 
Fireworks from Dreamweaver
The Property inspector also includes an icon that makes it easy to open an 
image in Photoshop or Fireworks from within Dreamweaver. The Edit icon 
changes to the icon of the program specified in Dreamweaver’s preferences. 

80
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To open an image in your preferred program, simply select the image in 
Dreamweaver, click the icon in the Property inspector, and watch your image 
appear as you’ve commanded.
Adobe has done some great work integrating the Photoshop and Fireworks 
programs into Dreamweaver. When you save changes to the image in 
Fireworks or Photoshop, they’re automatically reflected in the version you’ve 
already inserted into a page in Dreamweaver.
To specify the image editor you want to associate with a file type in 
Dreamweaver’s preferences, follow these instructions:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences 
(on a Mac).
 
 The Preferences dialog box opens.
 
2. On the left, select the File Types / Editors Category, as shown in 
Figure 3-10.
 
3. In the left pane under Extensions, click to select .gif.
 
 Dreamweaver lists a wide variety of file types here, and you can associ-
ate any or all of them with your favorite editors. To associate image edi-
tors with these graphic formats, select the GIF, PNG, and JPEG options 
one at a time and then continue with these steps.
 
4. In the right pane, under Editors, click to select the editor you want 
associated with the .gif format.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 3-10, Photoshop is listed already, so 
you can simply click Photoshop to select it. If you want to associate an 
editor that isn’t on this list, such as Fireworks, click the plus (+) sign just 
above the Editors pane, browse to find the program on your hard drive, 
and select it to make it appear on the list.
 
5. With the file type and program name selected, click the Make Primary 
button to associate the editor.
  
 The editor specified as Primary is launched automatically when you 
select an image in Dreamweaver and click the Edit button in the 
Property inspector.
 
6. Click to select .jpeg from the Extensions pane and repeat Steps 4 and 5.
 
 You can continue with this process for any or all the other formats 
listed.
 
 To add additional file formats to Dreamweaver, click the plus (+) sign over 
the Extensions pane and type the extension beginning with a dot (.).

Inserting a Background Image
Background images can add depth and richness to a page design by adding 
color and fullness. Used cleverly, a background image helps create the illu-
sion that the entire page is one large image while still downloading quickly 
and efficiently. The trick is to use an image with a small file size that creates 
the impression of a large image. One way this works on the Web is to use 
the default settings for a background image, which cause the image to tile 
(repeat) across and down the page (see Figure 3-11).
 
Beware that certain backgrounds (such as the one shown in Figure 3-11) can 
make it difficult to read text placed on top. Choose your background images 
carefully and make sure your background and your text have plenty of con-
trast — reading on a computer screen is hard enough.
 
With CSS, you can have far greater control over the display of a background 
image. When you create a CSS background style, you can insert a background 
image that doesn’t repeat or that repeats only across the Y axis or down 
the X axis of the page. When you insert an image using Dreamweaver’s Page 
Properties feature, as shown in Figure 3-12, you can use the Repeat drop-down 
list to specify how the image repeats on the page, and Dreamweaver automati-
cally creates a style for the page with these background settings. If you use 
the CSS Definition dialog box to further edit the background options in the 
body style, you can also specify where the background image is displayed on 
a page. (Find more on CSS background options in Chapter 5.)

Creating Image Maps
Image maps enable you to create hot spots (clickable areas) in an image and 
link each area to a different Web page. A common use of an image map is with 

83
 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
a geographic map, such as a map of the United States, that links to different 
locations, depending on the section of the map a visitor clicks. For example, 
if you have a national bank and want customers to find a local branch or 
ATM machine easily, you can create hot spots on an image map of the United 
States and then link each hot spot to a page listing banks in that geographic 
location.
Dreamweaver makes creating image maps easy by providing a set of simple 
drawing tools that enable you to create hot spots and set their correspond-
ing links. To create an image map, follow these steps:
 
1. Place the image you want to use as an image map on your page.
 
2. Select the image.
 
 The image properties are displayed in the Property inspector.
 
3. To draw your hot spot, choose a shape tool from the image map tools 
in the lower left of the Property inspector (labeled in Figure 3-13).
 
 The shape tools (a rectangle, a circle, and an irregular polygon) allow 
you to draw regions on your images, called hot spots, each with a spe-
cific link. In the example shown in Figure 3-13, I’m creating hot spots on 
each creature in the aquarium touch pool so that I can link each one to a 
different page with additional information about the animal.
 
4. With a shape tool selected, click and drag over an area of the image 
that you want to make hot (link to another page).
 
 Here’s how the different hot spot tools work:
 
• Rectangle: When you click and drag, a light blue highlight appears 
around the region that you’re making hot; this highlighted area 
indicates the active region. If you need to reposition the hot area, 
select the Pointer hotspot tool (labeled in Figure 3-13) and then 
select and move the region to the location you want. You can also 
resize the hot spot by clicking and dragging any of the corners.
 
• Circle: The Circle tool works much like the Rectangle tool — just 
click and drag. To resize a circle hot spot, select the Pointer 
hotspot tool, and click and drag one of the small square boxes on 
its edges.
 
• Polygon: The Polygon tool functions a little bit differently than the 
other two tools. To make a polygon selection, click the tool once 
for each point of the polygon shape you want to draw. The shape 
automatically connects the points while you click. When you’re fin-
ished, switch to another map tool or click outside the image. You 
can change the size of the polygon or move any of its points by 
using the Pointer hotspot tool.

 When prompted to describe the image map in the Alt field on the 
Property inspector, click OK to close the dialog box and then add 
a text description of the link in the Alt field in Hotspot properties 
of the Property inspector. The Alt field is for alternative text that 
doesn’t appear on the page itself. This text is used by screen read-
ers and other devices that read the code behind a page and need 
these descriptions of the hot spots in an image to better under-
stand the image map.
 
5. To link a selected hot area:
 
 
a. Click the Browse icon, next to the Link text box (at the top of the 
Property inspector).
 
 The Select File dialog box opens.

85
 Chapter 3: Adding Graphics
 
b. Browse to find the HTML file that you want to link to the hot spot 
on your image.
 
c. Double-click the file to which you want to link.
 
 The hot spot links to the selected page, and the Select File dialog 
box automatically closes.
 
 You can also type the path directly in the Link text box.
 
6. To add more hot spots, choose an image and a shape tool, and repeat 
Steps 4 and 5.
 
7. To give your image map a name, type a name in the Map text field, 
just above the shape tools.
 
 Giving your map (and all the hot spots it includes) a name helps to dis-
tinguish it in the event that you have multiple image maps on the same 
page. You can call the map anything you want, as long as you don’t 
include spaces or special punctuation.
 
 When you finish, all your image map hot spots are indicated by a light 
blue highlight.
 
At any time, you can go back and edit the image map. Simply click and high-
light the blue region on your image and drag the edges to resize the hot spot 
or enter a new URL to change the link.

f you’re anxious to get your site online, jump ahead to midway through 
this chapter, where you find instructions for using Dreamweaver’s pub-
lishing features in the “Publishing Your Site to a Web Server” section. But 
before you go live with your site, I recommend you spend a little time using 
Dreamweaver’s testing features to make sure your pages are ready for the all 
the world to see. I cover these features at the beginning of this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you find instructions for using Dreamweaver’s site 
management features, which are designed to help teams of designers work 
better together. These include the Check In/Out feature, which prevents two 
people from working on the same page on a site simultaneously — an impor-
tant feature if you want to make sure that one designer doesn’t overwrite the 
work of another. And believe me, you want to do everything you can to pre-
vent this situation.
If you want to work more on the design of your site before you move onto 
testing and publishing, feel free to skip ahead to the CSS chapters and other 
more advanced chapters that follow. You can always come back to this chap-
ter when you’re ready to put your work online.

Testing Your Site in Different Browsers
One of the more confusing and frustrating aspects of Web design is that you 
can create a page that looks great in Dreamweaver and test it in a browser 
to confirm that it looks fine, only to discover later that it looks terrible in a 
different browser or on a different computer system. Web pages can look dif-
ferent from one system to another for many reasons, but the following issues 
are the most common culprits:
 
 Browser differences: Today, dozens of browsers are in use on the Web, 
not counting the different versions of each browser. For example, at the 
time of this writing, Internet Explorer (IE) 7 is the newest release from 
Microsoft, but a significant percentage of Web users haven’t upgraded 
yet and are still using IE 6 or even earlier versions. Similarly, browser 
companies, such as Firefox and Safari, have now created a number of ver-
sions that are still in use on the Web. And each browser, as well as each 
browser version may display HTML and CSS code quite differently. This is 
because browsers have evolved over the years to support new technolo-
gies on the Web, but older browsers still in use may have trouble display-
ing everything you create on your Web pages. The other problem is that 
the companies that make Web browser don’t all agree or follow the same 
standards (although most are getting better with their latest versions).
 
 Hardware differences: Another challenge comes from the differences 
between Macintosh and Windows computers. For example, the most 
fonts appear smaller on a Macintosh than on a PC (Times 12 on a PC 
looks like Times 10 on a Mac). Image colors can also vary from one com-
puter to another.
 
 Individual resolution settings: The same Web page may look very dif-
ferent on a 21-inch monitor than it does on a 15-inch monitor. Even on 
the same monitor, different resolution settings can alter the way a page 
looks. On the PC, a common resolution is 1024 by 768 whereas on the 
Mac, the resolution is generally set much higher, making the design look 
much smaller, even if the monitor sizes are the same.
As a result of all these differences, the same Web page can look very differ-
ent to the many people who visit a Web site. For example, Figure 4-1 shows a 
Web page in Internet Explorer on a PC, and Figure 4-2 shows the same page 
in Safari on a Macintosh. Notice that the text displays in a larger font size on 
the PC, changing the way the text wraps around the photo in the left column. 
This difference may seem subtle in this page design, but font size and other 
variations can lead to dramatic changes in the display of the same Web page.

Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
This challenging aspect of the Web is at the root of many of the limitations 
and complications of creating good Web designs. With patience, testing, and 
an understanding of the tags and styles that are most problematic, you can 
create great Web sites that look good to most, if not all, of the people who 
visit your Web site.
Designing for browser differences
Getting your pages to look exactly the same across every browser in use on 
the Web is nearly impossible, unless you’re willing to use only the simplest 
and most basic HTML formatting options. But such consistency is rarely 
worth losing the design benefits of CSS. Entire books and Web sites are dedi-
cated to the best ways to design sites that look good on different browsers, 
especially when it comes to creating page designs with CSS.
 
Although I can’t possibly cover all these strategies here, the following tips and 
options give you a good start:
 
 Use Dreamweaver preview and testing features. For instance, 
Dreamweaver enables you to preview pages in many different kinds 
of browsers, as I explain in Chapter 2. You can also test your pages 
with Dreamweaver’s Browser Compatibility features, covered in the 
next section.
 
 Use Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts. I also recommend that you start your 
CSS design work with one of the predesigned CSS layouts included in 
Dreamweaver because these are already designed to display well on 
many different systems. You find instructions for customizing those 
layouts in Chapter 6.
 
 Create different versions of the same site or different style sheets. This 
approach is extreme, but you can create different versions of the same 
site, each designed for the unique display settings of the different brows-
ers and systems you expect your visitors will use. A script can then 
detect a user’s system and deliver the best site version. This approach 
may be warranted for some special cases. For example, big sites, such 
as Google and Amazon, have created special versions of their sites for 
mobile devices. Even more common, now that CSS has become so popu-
lar, many designers create multiple external style sheets for the same 
page. For example, you can create one set of styles that are optimal for 
printing, another that are optimal for screen display, and yet another for 
mobile devices. You find instructions for creating and attaching external 
style sheets in Chapter 5.

91
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
 Create a page that looks as good as possible on as many browsers as 
you consider important. This is the solution many designers settle for. 
The page may not look exactly the same on every system, but mostly the 
same is often okay. Which browsers you design for depends on your audi-
ence. If you have good log files or visitor statistics, you can view a list of 
the browsers (and even the browser versions) used by visitors to your 
site. For example, you may be able to determine that 70 percent of your 
audience uses Internet Explorer 7, 20 percent uses Firefox 2, 6 percent uses 
Internet Explorer 6, and only 4 percent uses Safari. With that in mind, you 
may decide that you want to optimize your pages to display best in Internet 
Explorer, make sure they look almost if not equally good in Firefox, and not 
worry as much about all the details when the page is viewed in Safari, as 
long as the content is at least readable and the page doesn’t look terrible.
If you want to create complex page designs with CSS and want your pages 
to look as good as possible on as many browsers as possible, a number of 
hacks, or workarounds, have been developed that can help ensure page 
designs look the same on a variety of browsers. Some of these tricks are rela-
tively simple; others are extraordinarily complex, and unfortunately, every 
time a new version of a browser, such as IE or Firefox is released, those hacks 
will probably have to be adjusted. You find more information on designing 
CSS for different Web browsers in Chapter 7.
If you know that your visitors will be using only one browser — for example, 
if you’re designing a corporate intranet and can require that all employees 
use Firefox 3 — your design work is simpler. Some public Web site designers 
resort to putting a note on the front page of a site advising anyone who visits 
that the pages display best in a particular browser. Although that may be 
warranted in some cases, I don’t recommend it because you risk losing many 
potential visitors.
Using Dreamweaver’s Browser 
Compatibility feature
In addition to being able to preview a Web page in any Web browser on your 
hard drive, Dreamweaver also includes a Browser Compatibility feature that 
can help you test for known issues among different browsers automatically.
To use this feature, open a page in Dreamweaver and choose File➪Check 
Page➪Browser Compatibility. You can also access this feature by clicking the 
Check Page drop-down arrow at the top right of the workspace and selecting 
Check Browser Compatibility from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 4-3. 
Any recognized conflicts display in a report at the bottom of the workspace.

You can specify which browsers and browser versions you want to target by 
doing either of the following:
 
 Click the small menu icon at the top-left corner of the Browser 
Compatibility Check dialog box and choose Settings from the drop-down 
list to open the Target Browsers dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
 From the Check Page drop-down list, choose Settings to open the Target

Testing Your Work with the 
Site Reporting Features
Before you put your site online for the world to see, check your work using 
the Dreamweaver Site Reporting feature. You can create a variety of reports 
and even customize them to identify problems with external links, redundant 

93
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
and empty tags, untitled documents, and missing Alt text. You can easily 
miss things — especially when you work on a tight deadline — and what you 
miss can cause real problems for your viewers.
Before Dreamweaver added this great new feature, finding these kinds of 
mistakes was a tedious, time-consuming task. Now you can run a report that 
identifies these errors for you and use Dreamweaver to correct mistakes 
across your entire site automatically.
Follow these steps to produce a Site Report of your entire Web site:
 
1. In the drop-down list at the top of the Files panel, select the site name. 
In the list that appears, select the site you want to work on.
 
 Your site appears in the Files panel list only if you’ve completed the site 
setup process covered in Chapter 2.
 
2. Make sure any open documents are saved by choosing File➪Save All.
 
3. Choose Site➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears (see Figure 4-5).
 
Figure 4-5: 
You can 
select any 
and all 
options, and 
you can run 
reports on a 
single page 
or the entire 
site.
 
 
4. In the Report On drop-down list, choose Entire Current Local Site.
 
 You can also choose to check only a single page by opening the page in 
Dreamweaver and then choosing Current Document in the Report On 
drop-down list. You can also run a report on selected files or on a par-
ticular folder. If you choose Selected Files in Site, you must have already 
selected the pages you want to check in the Files panel.
 
5. In the Select Reports section, select the reports you want.
 
 Table 4-1 describes the kind of report you get with each option. You can 
select as many reports as you want.

94
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 The Workflow options in the Select Reports section are functional only if 
you already enabled Check In/Out in the Remote Info section of the Site 
Definition dialog box and selected Maintain Design Notes in the Design 
Notes section of the Site Definition dialog box’s Advanced tab. You can 
read more about the Site Definition dialog box in Chapter 2 and more 
about Design Notes and the Check In/Out in the “Making the Most of 
Dreamweaver’s Site Management Features” section, later in this chapter.
 
6. Click the Run button to create the report(s).
 
 If you haven’t already done so, you may be prompted to save your file, 
define your site, or select a folder. (See Chapter 2 for more information 
on defining a site in Dreamweaver.)
 
 The Results panel appears, as shown in Figure 4-6, displaying a list of 
problems found on the site. You can sort the list by different categories 
(filename, line number, or description) by clicking the corresponding 
column headings.
 
Figure 4-6: 
The Results 
panel dis-
plays a list 
of problems 
on your site.
 
 
7. Double-click any item in the Results panel to open the corresponding 
file in the Document window.
 
 You can also right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) on any line of 
the report and choose More Info to find additional details about the spe-
cific error or condition.
 
8. Use the Property inspector or another Dreamweaver feature to correct 
the identified problem and then save the file.
Finding and Fixing Broken Links
If you’re trying to rein in a chaotic Web site or if you just want to check a site 
for broken links, you’ll be pleased to discover the Check Links feature. You 
can use Check Links to verify the links in a single file or an entire Web site, 
and you can use it to automatically fix all the referring links at once.
Here’s an example of what Check Links can do. Assume that someone on 
your team (because you would never do such a thing yourself) changed the 
name of a file from new.htm to old.htm without using the Files panel or 

95
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
any of Dreamweaver’s automatic link update features. Maybe this person 
changed the name using another program or simply renamed it in Explorer 
(Windows) or the Finder (Mac). Changing the filename was easy, but what 
this person may not have realized is that if he or she didn’t change the links 
to the file when the file was renamed, the links are now broken.
If only one page links to the file that your clueless teammate changed, fixing 
the broken link isn’t such a big deal. As long as you remember which file the 
page links from, you can simply open that page and use the Property inspec-
tor to reset the link the same way you created the link in the first place. (You 
can find out all the basics of link creation in Chapter 2.)
But many times, a single page in a Web site is linked to many other pages. 
When that’s the case, fixing all the link references can be time-consuming, 
and forgetting some of them is all too easy. That’s why the Check Links fea-
ture is so helpful. First, it serves as a diagnostic tool that identifies broken 
links throughout the site (so you don’t have to second-guess where someone 
may have changed a filename or moved a file). Then it serves as a global fix-it 
tool. You can use the Check Links dialog box to identify the page a broken 
link should go to, and Dreamweaver automatically fixes all links referring to 
that page. The following section walks you through this cool process.
 
If you’re working on a dynamic, database-driven site or if your site was altered 
with programming that was performed outside Dreamweaver, the Check Links 
feature may not work properly. This feature works best for sites with static 
HTML pages.
Checking for broken links
To check a site for broken links, follow these steps:
 
1. In the drop-down list at the top of the Files panel, select the site name. 
In the list that appears, select the site you want to work on.
 
 Link checking works only for sites listed in the Dreamweaver Site dialog 
box. For more information about the Site dialog box and how to set up a 
new site or import an existing one, see Chapter 2.
 
2. Choose Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
 
 The Link Checker tab opens in the Results panel at the bottom of the 
page, just under the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 4-7. The tab 
displays a list of internal and external links. The tab also lists any pages, 
images, or other items not linked from any other page in the site — 
dubbed orphans. Unused images can waste space on your server, so this 
list is handy if you want to clean up old images or other elements you no 
longer use on the site.

96
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 Most service providers limit the amount of space on your server and 
charge extra if you exceed that limit. You can save valuable server 
space by deleting unused files, especially if they’re image or multimedia 
files. But remember, just because you delete them from your hard drive 
doesn’t mean they’re deleted from the server. Make sure you remove 
them from the Remote Site window in the Files panel as well as the Local 
Site panel. (For more on using FTP and synchronization to update or 
delete files on your server, see the section, “Publishing Your Site to a 
Web Server,” later in this chapter.)
 
Figure 4-7: 
The report 
can be 
organized 
by broken 
links, exter-
nal links, 
and unused 
files.
 
Fixing broken links
Broken links are one of the worst problems you can have on a Web site. After 
you identify a broken link in a site, fix it as soon as possible. Nothing turns off 
visitors faster than clicking a link and getting a File Not Found error page. 
Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes fixing broken links simple by providing 
quick access to files with broken links and automating the process of fixing 
multiple links to the same file.
After using the Link Checker tab described in the preceding section to iden-
tify broken links, follow these steps to use the Results panel to fix them:
 
1. With the Results panel open at the bottom of the page, double-click a 
filename that Dreamweaver identifies as a broken link.
 
 The page and its corresponding Property inspector open. The Results 
panel remains visible.
 
2. Select the broken link or image on the open page.
 
 For example, you can fix a broken image by selecting the broken image 
icon in the page and then reinserting it using the Property inspector to 
find the correct image name.
 
3. In the Property inspector, click the folder icon to the right of the Src 
text box to identify the correct image file.

97
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
 (Alternatively, you can type the correct filename and path in the text box 
instead of using the browse option to find the correct image.) The Select 
Image Source dialog box appears. You fix links to pages just as you fix 
links to images, except you type the name of the correct file into the Link 
text box or click the folder icon next to it to find the file in your site folder.
 
4. Click to select the filename of the correct image or file and then 
click OK.
 
 The link automatically changes to reflect the new filename and location. 
If you replace an image, the image file reappears on the page.
Finding files by their addresses
If you’re not sure where you saved a file or 
what you called it, but you can get to it with 
your browser, you can determine the filename 
and location by looking at the URL in the brows-
er’s address bar. Each folder in a Web site is 
included in the address to a page within that 
folder. Folder names are separated by the for-
ward slash, /, and each filename can be distin-
guished because it includes an extension. For 
example, the URL in the browser’s address bar 
of the page displayed in this figure tells me that 
the file is named index.html and is located 
in the kiev folder, which is a subfolder of the 
main folder for the Web site.
Similarly, you can identify the name and loca-
tion of any image you’re viewing on a Web 
page. If you’re using Internet Explorer or 
Firefox, place your cursor over the image and 
right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) 
and then choose Properties. The Element 
Properties dialog box includes the specific URL 
of the image, which has the name and folder 
(path). In the Element Properties dialog box 
shown in this example, you can see that the 
logo that appears in the top left of the page is 
ArtesianMedia-logo.jpg and is stored 
in an images folder. If you’re using the Safari 
browser on a Mac, it works a little differently. 
Control+click an image and choose Open Image 
in New Window. In the new window, the image 
URL appears in the location bar.

98
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
If the link that you correct appears in multiple pages and you fix the link 
using the broken link’s Results panel, Dreamweaver prompts you with a 
dialog box asking whether you want to fix the remaining broken link refer-
ences to the file. Click the Yes button to automatically correct all other 
references. Click the No button to leave the other files unchanged.
Managing Linked Files
Dreamweaver includes a variety of tools that help you manage the files and 
folders within a site without breaking links. You can use the Files panel to 
rename and rearrange files and folders, as well as create new folders, all with 
drag-and-drop ease.
 
You need to define your site for Dreamweaver’s Files panel features to work. If 
you haven’t already defined your site, turn to the instructions at the beginning 
of Chapter 2.
Moving and renaming files
To rearrange or rename files, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the site you want to work on (if it’s not already active) in the 
drop-down list at the top of the Files panel.
 
 When you select a site by clicking the site name, the folders and files in 
that site appear in the Files panel.
 
2. Click the plus (+) sign to open the main site root folder or any sub-
folder so that you can access the files.
 
 Click the minus (–) sign to close a folder.
 
3. In the Files panel, select the file or folder you want to move or rename 
or both.
 
 To move a selected file or folder:
 
a. Drag the selected file or group of files into a folder.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically changes all the related links. The Files 
panel works much like the Explorer window on a PC or the Finder 
on a Mac, except Dreamweaver tracks and fixes links when you 
move files through the Files panel. By contrast, if you move or 
rename site files or folders in the Finder or Explorer, you break any 
links set to or from those files.

99
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
 When you move a linked file into a new folder in Dreamweaver, the 
Update Files dialog box appears with a list of links that needs to be 
updated, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
b. To adjust the links, choose Update.
 
 If you choose Don’t Update, any links to or from that file are left 
unchanged.
 
 To rename a selected file:
 
a. Click twice on any filename or folder name.
 
b. When a box appears around the name, edit it just as you would a 
name in the Finder or Explorer and then press Enter (Return on 
a Mac).
 
 Again you’re prompted with the Update Files dialog box to update 
any links affected by the filename change.
 
c. Choose Update to adjust the links.
 
Figure 4-8: 
The Update 
Files dialog 
box lists 
all the files 
that will be 
changed 
during the 
update 
process.
 
Making global changes to links
If you want to globally change a link to point at a new URL or to some other 
page on your site, you can use the Change Link Sitewide option to enter the 
new URL and change every reference automatically. You can use this option to 
change any kind of link, including mailto, ftp, and script links. For example, if 
an e-mail address that you use throughout your site changes, you can use this 
feature to fix it automatically — a real timesaver. You can use this feature also 
when you want a string of text to link to a different file than it currently does. 
For example, you can change every instance of the words Enter This Month’s 
Contest to link to /contest/january.htm instead of /contest/december.
htm throughout your Web site.

100
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To change a collection of links with the Change Link Sitewide feature, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is displayed in the Files panel.
 
 See the preceding exercise for instructions on selecting a site.
 
2. Choose Site➪Change Link Sitewide.
 
 The Change Link Sitewide dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter the old address and then enter the new address, or click the 
Browse button to identify files where you want to change the links.
 
 You can use this feature to change any link, including e-mail links, links 
from one page to another within a site, or links to a different Web site.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Dreamweaver updates any documents that include the specified links.
 
Any changes you make to links using Dreamweaver’s automated link features 
occur only on the local version of your site on your hard drive. Make sure 
you upload all affected files to your Web server to ensure that all changes are 
included on your published site. To automatically reconcile changes on your 
local and remote sites, use Dreamweaver’s Synchronize Files feature, which I 
describe later in this chapter.
Publishing Your Site to a Web Server
After you create your Web site, test it, and are ready to publish it on the Web, 
it’s time to put Dreamweaver’s publishing tools to work. Which features you 
use depends on the kind of Web server you use. If you’re using a commercial 
service provider, you’ll most likely need Dreamweaver’s FTP features, which I 
cover in detail in the following section.
To access Dreamweaver’s publishing tools:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
 
2. In the list of defined sites, select the site you want to publish and then 
click the Edit button.
 
 The Site Definition dialog box opens. If you haven’t already defined your 
site, refer to the instructions for this important initial site setup process 
at the beginning of Chapter 2.
 
3. Select the Advanced tab from the top of the Site Definition dialog box.
 
 The Advanced options appear instead of the Site Definition Wizard 
available on the Basic tab.

101
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
4. In the Category list, select the Remote Info category, as shown in 
Figure 4-9 (in the next exercise).
 
5. Click the Access drop-down arrow and select the publishing option 
that is best suited to your Web server and development environment. 
(In Figure 4-9, FTP is selected.)
 
 Dreamweaver provides six Access options:
 
• None: Select this option if you’re not uploading your site to a 
server or if you’re not yet ready to fill in these settings.
 
• FTP: Select this option to use Dreamweaver’s built-in File Transfer 
Protocol features, which I cover in detail in the following section. 
These are the settings you’re most likely to need if you’re using a 
commercial Web hosting service.
 
• Local/Network: Select this option if you’re using a Web server on 
a local network, such as your company or university server. For 
specific settings and requirements, check with your system 
administrator.
 
• WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning): 
Select this option if you’re using a server with the WebDAV proto-
col, such as Microsoft IIS.
 
• RDS (Rapid Development Services): Select this option if you’re 
using ColdFusion on a remote server.
 
• Microsoft Visual SourceSafe: Select this option if you’re using 
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe. Note this option is available only 
in Windows.
Setting up Web server access for FTP
To make your life simpler, Dreamweaver incorporates FTP capability so that 
you can easily upload your pages to a remote Web server. The FTP options 
include features that can help you keep track of changes you make to files on 
your hard drive and ensure that they match the files on your Web server.
To upload your site using FTP, you need the following information from your 
Web hosting service:
 
 FTP host name
 
 Path for the Web directory (this is optional but useful)
 
 FTP login
 
 FTP password

102
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
To access the FTP features in Dreamweaver:
 
1. Follow the steps in the preceding section, choosing FTP in Step 5.
 
 The dialog box in Figure 4-9 appears.
 
2. In the FTP Host text box, type the hostname of your Web server.
 
 The hostname should look something like ftp.host.com, shell.
host.com, or ftp.domain.com, depending on your server. (In my 
example, I used ftp.artesianmedia.com.)
 
3. In the Host Directory text box, type the directory on the remote site in 
which documents visible to the public are stored (also known as the 
site root).
 
 The host directory looks something like public_html/ or www/
htdocs/. Again, this depends on your server.
 
4. In the Login and Password text boxes, type the login name and pass-
word, respectively, required to gain access to your Web server.
 
 If you check the Save box, Dreamweaver stores the information and 
automatically supplies it to the server when you connect to the remote 
site.
 
 This is your unique login and password information that provides you 
access to your server.

 Click the Test button to make sure you’ve entered everything correctly. 
If there are no problems, Dreamweaver responds with a box saying 
Dreamweaver connected to your Web server successfully. 
(Note: You must save the password to use the test feature, but you can 
deselect the Save Password box after you test if you prefer not to save 
the password in the program.)
 
5. Select the Use Passive FTP or Use Firewall option only if your service 
provider or site administrator instructs you to do so.
 
 If you aren’t on a network but you do use a commercial service provider, 
you don’t need to select either option.
 
6. Click OK to save your Remote Info settings and close the Site Definition 
dialog box. Then click Done to close the Manage Sites dialog box.
 
If you prefer to use a dedicated FTP program instead of Dreamweaver’s built-
in features, you can download FTP programs for the Mac and PC at the follow-
ing Web addresses:
 
 www.ipswitch.com: A popular FTP program for the PC, WS_FTP, can 
be downloaded here.
 
 www.cuteftp.com: A popular Windows program, CuteFTP, can be 
downloaded from here.
 
 www.fetchsoftworks.com and www.panic.com/transmit: If you use 
a Macintosh computer, popular options are Fetch, available for download 
at the former, and Transmit, available for download at the latter.
Putting your Web site online
Now that your site is set up, upload pages on your server and retrieve them 
by using the built-in FTP capabilities of Dreamweaver.
To transfer files between your hard drive and a remote server, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Make sure you’ve defined your site (as I describe in the beginning of 
Chapter 2), opened and displayed the site you want to upload in the Files 
panel, and used all the FTP settings described in the previous section.
 
 
2. In the top left of the Files panel, click the Connects to Remote Host icon.
 
 If you’re not already connected to the Internet, the Connects to Remote 
Host icon starts your dialup connection. If you have trouble connecting 
this way, try establishing your Internet connection as you usually do to 
check e-mail or surf the Web, and then return to Dreamweaver and click the 
Connects to Remote Host icon after establishing your Internet connection. 
When your computer is online, Dreamweaver should have no trouble auto-
matically establishing an FTP connection with your host server.

104
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
 If you still have trouble establishing a connection to your Web server, 
refer to the preceding section, “Setting up Web server access for FTP,” 
and make sure that you specified the server information correctly. If you 
still have trouble, contact your service provider or site administrator to 
ensure that you have all the correct information for connecting to your 
server. Getting all this information set up correctly the first time can be 
tricky, and each service provider is different. (The good news is that 
after you get the connection working, you save it in Dreamweaver, which 
makes it super easy to reconnect in the future.)
 
 After you establish the connection, you can move between views in this 
panel by choosing from the drop-down list at the top right, (visible in Figure 
4-10). The main options are Local View, which displays files on your local 
hard drive, and Remote View, which displays files on the server.

3. To upload a file (transfer a file from your hard drive to your Web 
server), select the file from the Local View panel (which displays the 
files on your hard drive) and click the Put Files icon (the up arrow) in 
the Files panel.
 
 The files are copied automatically to your server when you transfer them. 
You can select multiple files or folders to be transferred simultaneously.

105
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
 
 After you upload files to you server, test your work by using a Web 
browser to view them online. Sometimes things that look and work fine 
on your computer (such as links) won’t work on the server.
 
4. To download files or folders (transfer files or folders from your Web 
server to your hard drive), select the files or folders from the Remote 
View panel (which displays the files on your server) and click the Get 
Files button (the down arrow) in the Files panel.
 
 The files are copied automatically to your hard drive when you transfer 
them.
  
 Be aware that when you copy files to or from your server, the files 
you’re transferring overwrite the files already at the destination. 
Dreamweaver notifies you about the overwriting if it notices you’re 
replacing a newer file with an older one, but it can’t always correctly 
assess the proper time differences. Take note of these warnings, but 
keep in mind that you can get warnings that aren’t always accurate when 
they’re based on the age of a file.
 
 When the transfer is complete, you can open the files on your hard drive.
 
You can see both the remote and local views simultaneously by clicking the 
Expand/Collapse icon on the far right side of the Files panel (labeled in Figure 
4-10). To collapse this Site dialog box and return the Files panel to the side of 
the screen again, click the Expand/Collapse icon again.
 
The arrows with the check mark and the little lock at the top of the Files panel 
are for the Check In/Out feature, which enables you to keep track of who is 
working on a site and prevent more than one person making changes to the 
same page. These features are covered in the “Using Check In and Check Out” 
section, later in this chapter. The circle with the double arrows is for the 
Synchronize option covered in the section that follows.
Synchronizing local and remote sites
One of the most valuable features in Dreamweaver’s FTP options is the capa-
bility to automatically synchronize the files on your hard drive with the files 
on your server. This is cool because it helps you keep track of which pages 
you’ve edited and ensures that they’ve been updated on the server. This may 
not matter much to you the first time you upload your site, or if you have 
only a few pages in your site. But if you have a large site and make frequent 
updates, this feature is a wonderful way to make sure all the changes you 
make get to your server. Dreamweaver also confirms which files are updated 
after you complete the synchronization.

106
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Downloading an existing Web site
If you want to work on an existing Web site 
and you don’t already have a copy of it on 
your local computer’s hard drive, you can use 
Dreamweaver to download any or all the files in 
the site so that you can edit the existing pages, 
add new pages, or use any of Dreamweaver’s 
other features to check links and manage the 
site’s further development. The first step is to 
get a copy of the site onto your computer by 
downloading it from the server.
To download an existing Web site, follow these 
steps:
 1. Create a new folder on your computer to 
store the existing site.
 2. Specify this folder as the local root folder 
for the site with Dreamweaver’s site setup 
features.
 
 Check out Chapter 2 for information on defin-
ing a site, if you’re not sure how to do this.
 3. Set up the Remote Info dialog box.
 
 I explain how to do this in the “Setting up 
Web server access for FTP” section.
 4. Connect to the remote site by clicking the 
Connects to Remote Host button, which 
looks like the ends of two cables, in the 
Files panel.
 5. Click the Get Files button, which looks like 
a down arrow, to download the entire site 
to your local drive.
 
 Sometimes your Web host has files on 
the remote server that you don’t need to 
download. If you want to download only 
specific files or folders from the site, select 
those files or folders in the Remote Site 
pane of the Files panel and click the Get 
Files button. Dreamweaver automatically 
duplicates some or all of the remote site’s 
structure, meaning the folders in the site 
but not all the files within them, and places 
the downloaded files in the correct part of 
the site hierarchy. Re-creating the folder 
structure on your local computer is impor-
tant because Dreamweaver needs to know 
the location of the files as they relate to 
other parts of the site to set links properly. 
The safest option is to download the entire 
site; but if you’re working on a large Web 
project, downloading a part and duplicating 
the structure enables you to work on a sec-
tion of the site without downloading it all.
 
 If you’re working on only one page or sec-
tion of a site, generally choose to include 
dependent files, meaning any files linked 
from those pages, to ensure that links are 
set properly when you make changes.
 6. After you download the site or specific 
files or folders, you can edit them as you 
do any other file in Dreamweaver.
Follow these steps to synchronize your Web site:
 
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is selected and displayed in 
the Files panel.
 
 
2. Click the Connects to Remote Host icon, in the top left of the Files 
panel, to log on to your remote site.

107
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
3. Click the Expand/Collapse icon (labeled in Figure 4-10) to expand the 
dialog box and view the remote and local sites simultaneously.
 
 The Site dialog box displays both the remote and local views of the site. 
(To collapse this dialog box, click the Expand/Collapse icon again.)
 
4. Choose Site➪Synchronize.
 
 The Synchronize Files dialog box appears.
 
5. In the Synchronize drop-down list, choose whether to synchronize the 
Entire Site or Selected Files Only.
 
6. In the Direction drop-down list, choose which option you want to use 
to copy the files:
 
• Put Newer Files to Remote: This option copies the most recently 
modified files from your local site to the remote site. Click the 
Delete Remote Files Not on Local Drive box if you want those files 
removed from your Web site.
 
• Get Newer Files from Remote: This option copies the most 
recently modified files from your remote site to the local site. Click 
the Delete Local Files Not on Remote Server box if you want to 
remove those files from your local copy.
 
• Get and Put Newer Files: This option updates both the local and 
remote sites with the most recent versions of all the files.
 
 Make sure the Delete Remote Files Not on Local Drive box is not selected.
 
 Be careful of this feature when using Get or Put. As a general rule, I rec-
ommend you leave it deselected because you may have folders and files 
on the server, such as log files, that don’t exist on your hard drive, and 
you don’t want to delete them inadvertently.
 
7. Click the Preview button.
 
 The Site FTP dialog box displays the files that are about to be changed.
 
 Now you have the option to verify the files you want to delete, put, and 
get. If you don’t want Dreamweaver to alter a file, deselect it from the 
Site FTP dialog box now or forever live with the consequences.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 All approved changes are automatically made, and Dreamweaver 
updates the Site FTP dialog box with the status.
 
9. When the synchronization finishes, you can choose to save or not save 
the verification information to a local file.
 
 I recommend that you save the verification information because it can 
be handy if you want to review your changes after synchronization is 
complete.

108
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Setting Cloaking Options
The Dreamweaver Cloaking option enables you to exclude folders or files 
from all site operations, meaning they won’t be uploaded to the live site when 
you’re synchronizing or batching files back and forth. This feature is handy if 
you have sections of a site that you want to save but don’t want visible to your 
viewers. For example, if you have a special holiday folder that you don’t want 
visible during the rest of the year, you can use the Cloaking feature to save it 
locally, with the assurance that no one can accidentally publish the files with 
Dreamweaver until you uncloak them and publish them in December.
To use the Cloaking feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
2. Select the site you want to work on and then click Edit.
 
 The Site Definition dialog box appears.
 
3. If it’s not already selected, click the Advanced tab at the top of the dialog 
box and choose the Cloaking category from the Category list on the left.
 
4. Select the Enable Cloaking box.
 
5. (Optional) To cloak files of a certain type, select the Cloak Files 
Ending With box and enter the extension(s) in the text field, as shown 
in Figure 4-11.
 
 For example, if you want to cloak any original Photoshop files that may 
be saved in your local root folder so they don’t upload and take up 
space on your server, enter the .psd extension. If you want to cloak 
more than one file type, separate each file extension with a space. Do 
not use a comma or other delimiter.
 
6. Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box and then click the 
Done button in the Define Sites dialog box to close it.
 
 Files matching the extensions specified, if any, are now cloaked.
 
7. (Optional) To manually cloak specific folders or files, select the fold-
ers or files in the Files tab of the Files panel.
 
8. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) and choose 
Cloaking➪Cloak.
To uncloak files or folders, repeat Steps 7–8 and select Uncloak from the 
shortcut menu in Step 8. You can also use these steps to uncloak all the files 
in your current site, disable cloaking in the site, and change the cloaking 
settings.
 
If you disable cloaking for all files, any manual cloaking choices you’ve made 
are lost, even if you enable cloaking again later.

Making the Most of Dreamweaver’s 
Site Management Features
In the following sections, you find descriptions and instructions for using 
more of the options available from the Site Definition dialog box, including 
Design Notes, Check In/Out, and integrated e-mail. If you’re the only person 
working on a Web site, you probably don’t need the features described in 
Editing Web pages online
If you’re an experienced Web designer and just 
want to make quick changes to a site or use the 
FTP features to access files on a server with-
out doing the site setup steps, Dreamweaver 
does enable you to use these features without 
completing site setup. To access FTP features 
and set them up quickly, choose Site➪Manage 
Sites and then choose New➪FTP & RDS 
Server from the Manage Sites dialog box. This 
shortcut enables you to work directly on your 
server using the FTP & RDS Server; however, 
Dreamweaver doesn’t manage link checking, 
and none of the other site management fea-
tures work.

110
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
this section because they’re intended for use on sites developed by a team of 
people who need to communicate with each other and make sure they don’t 
overwrite each other’s work.
Using a testing server
The Testing Server option enables you to specify a development server, a 
necessary step if you’re creating a Web site using the Dreamweaver dynamic 
page-creation features for developing sites using PHP, ASP, or ColdFusion. 
You find more information about using these options in Chapters 14 and 15.
Enabling Check In and Check Out
The Check In/Out feature is designed to keep people from overwriting each 
other’s work when more than one person is working on the same Web site 
(a valuable feature if you want to keep peace among all the members of your 
Web design team). When a person working on the Web site checks out a file, 
other developers working on the site can’t make changes to that file. When 
you check out a file, a green check mark appears next to the filename in the 
Files panel. If someone else checks out a file, you see a red check mark next 
to the filename.
To enable the Check In/Out feature, follow these steps:
 
These steps assume you’ve already set up the remote info for your site, using 
FTP or one of the other remote options. If you haven’t yet done so, first com-
plete the steps in the “Publishing Your Site to a Web Server,” section earlier in 
this chapter.
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites, select the site you want to work on, and 
click Edit.
 
2. In the Site Definition dialog box that appears, make sure the 
Advanced tab is selected and then select the Remote Info category on 
the left.
 
 If you have not already selected a Remote Access option and filled in the 
fields, you will need to do so before you can set up Check In/Check Out. 
 
3. Select the Enable File Check In and Check Out option at the bottom of 
the Remote Info dialog box.
 
 The dialog box expands to expose other options.

111
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
4. (Optional) If you want files checked out whenever they’re opened, 
select the Check Out Files When Opening option.
 
5. In the Check Out Name field, fill in the name you want associated 
with the files (presumably your name or nickname so other people 
working on the site know it’s you).
 
6. In the Email Address field, fill in your e-mail address.
 
7. Click OK to save your changes and close the Site Definition dialog box.
 
 With this Check Out feature, you can track which files a particular person is 
working on. The Email Address field is needed for Dreamweaver’s integra-
tion with e-mail, which facilitates communication among developers on a 
site. See the next section for more information about integrated e-mail.
Using Design Notes
If you sometimes forget the details of your work or neglect to tell your colleagues 
important things about the Web site you’re all working on, the Dreamweaver 
Design Notes feature may save you some grief.
Design Notes is ideal if you want to hide sensitive information from visitors, 
such as pricing structures or creative strategies, but make it available to 
members of your development team. Information saved as a Design Note in 
Dreamweaver can travel with any HTML file or image, even if the file transfers 
from one Web site to another or from Fireworks to Dreamweaver.
Essentially, Design Notes enable you to record information (such as a mes-
sage to another designer on your team) and associate it with a file or a folder. 
Design Notes work a lot like the comment tag (HTML code that enables you 
to embed in a page text that won’t appear in a browser) but with a bit more 
privacy. Unlike the comment tag, which is embedded directly in the HTML 
code of a page (and can be seen if someone views the source code behind a 
page on the Web), Design Notes are never visible to your visitors. The only 
way for a visitor to view Design Notes is to deliberately type the path to your 
notes subdirectory and view the notes files directly. You can even explicitly 
block this from being allowed, but only if you have administrative access to 
your server. To be even more secure, you can keep the notes on your hard 
drive and prevent them from ever being uploaded to your server — though, 
of course, your team members won’t see your witty remarks.
 
When you create graphics in Adobe Fireworks, you can save a Design Note for 
each image file that’s also available in Dreamweaver. To use this integrated 
feature, create a Design Note in Fireworks and associate it with the image. 
Then when you save the Fireworks image to your local Web site folder, the 
Design Note goes with it. When you open the file in Dreamweaver, the Design 

112
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
Note appears when you right-click the image (Control-click on the Mac). This 
feature is a great way for graphic designers to communicate with other mem-
bers of the Web development team.
Setting up Design Notes
To activate the Design Notes feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
 
2. Select the site you want to work on and then click the Edit button.
 
 The Site Definition dialog box opens.
 
3. Select the Advanced tab.
 
4. In the Category list at the left, choose Design Notes.
 
 The Design Notes page appears.
 
5. Select the Maintain Design Notes option.
 
 With this option selected, whenever you copy, move, rename, or delete 
a file, the associated Design Notes file is also copied, moved, renamed, 
or deleted with it.
 
6. (Optional) If you want your Design Notes to be sent with your files 
when they’re uploaded to your server, select the Upload Design Notes 
for Sharing option.
 
 If you’re making notes only to yourself and don’t want them to be associ-
ated with the page when you upload it to the server, deselect this option 
and the Design Notes will be maintained locally but not uploaded with 
your file.
 
7. Click OK in the Site Definition dialog box and then click the Done 
button in the Manage Sites dialog box.
 
 The Manage Sites dialog box closes.
The Clean Up button is useful after you’ve used Design Notes for a while. 
Click this button to delete any Design Notes that aren’t associated with a file 
in the site. (This is useful for cleaning up Design Notes that correspond to 
pages, images, or other files that have been deleted from the site.)
Adding a note with Design Notes
To add Design Notes to a document, follow these steps:

113
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
1. Open the file you want to add a Design Note to and then choose 
File➪Design Notes.
 
 The Design Notes dialog box opens (see Figure 4-12). You need to have a 
file checked out to add or modify a Design Note, but not to read a note.
 
Figure 4-12: 
Design 
Notes make 
it easy to 
add mes-
sages to 
documents, 
images, and 
even entire 
folders.
 
 
2. In the Status drop-down list, choose the status of the document.
 
 Your options are Draft, Revision 1, Revision 2, Revision 3, Alpha, Beta, 
Final, and Needs Attention. You can choose any status, and you should 
set a policy with your design team about what each status means and 
how you use these options to manage your development.
 
3. In the Notes text box, type your comments.
 
 
4. (Optional) To insert the current local date, click the Insert Date icon, 
which is just above the Notes text box.
 
 The current date is inserted automatically.
 
 You can also select the Show When File Is Open check box. If this box is 
selected, the Design Notes appear whenever the file is opened so that 
they can’t be missed.
 
5. Click the All Info tab.
 
 You can add other information that may be useful to developers of your 
site. For example, you can name a key designer (in the Name field) and 
define the value as the name of that person or the priority of the project 
(in the Value field). You may also define a field for a client or the type of 
file that you commonly use.

114
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
 
6. Click the plus (+) button to add a new information item; click the 
minus (–) button to remove a selected item.
 
7. Click OK to save the notes.
 
 The notes you entered are saved to a notes subfolder in the same 
location as the current file. The filename is the document’s filename 
plus the extension .mno. For example, if the filename is art.htm, 
the associated Design Notes file is art.htm.mno. Design Notes are 
indicated in Site View by a small yellow icon that looks like a cartoon 
bubble.
Enabling Contribute features
Adobe Contribute is a program that was created so that people who don’t 
know much about Web design can easily contribute to a Web site. Think 
of Contribute as sort of a Dreamweaver Light, except it doesn’t work very 
well as a standalone program. Contribute was designed to work on sites 
designed in Dreamweaver, and a number of features have been carefully 
integrated to make that collaboration work smoothly. If you’re working with 
other developers of a site who use Contribute, make sure you select the 
Enable Contribute Compatibility box in the Contribute category of the Site 
Definition dialog box.
Remembering Your History
You can keep track of what you’re doing and even replay your steps with the 
History panel. The History panel also lets you undo one or more steps and 
create commands to automate repetitive tasks.
To open the History panel, as shown in Figure 4-13, choose Window➪History. 
As soon as you open a file, the History panel starts automatically recording 
your actions as you work in Dreamweaver. You can’t rearrange the order of 
steps in the History panel, but you can copy them, replay them, and undo 
them. Don’t think of the History panel as an arbitrary collection of com-
mands; think of it as a way to view the steps you’ve performed, in the order 
in which you performed them. This is a great way to let Dreamweaver do 
your work for you if you have to repeat the same steps over and over. It’s 
also a lifesaver if you make a major mistake and want to go back one or more 
steps in your development work.

115
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
Here’s a rundown of how you can put the History panel to use:
 
 To copy steps you already executed: Use the Copy Steps option in the 
lower right as a quick way to automate steps you want to repeat. You 
can even select steps individually, in case you want to replay some (but 
not all) actions exactly as you did them.
 
 To replay any or all steps displayed in the History panel: Highlight the 
steps you want to replay and click the Replay button at the bottom of 
the History panel.
 
 To undo the results of the replayed steps: Choose Edit➪Undo Replay 
Steps.
 
 To apply steps to a specific element on a page: Highlight that element 
in the Document window before selecting and replaying the steps. For 
example, if you want to apply bold and italic formatting to just a few 
words on a page, you can replay the steps that applied bold and italics 
to selected text.
 
Figure 4-13: 
In the 
History 
panel, track 
what you do 
and undo or 
repeat steps 
easily.
 
Repeating your steps with Recorded Commands
You can automate repeat tasks using 
Dreamweaver’s Recorded Commands feature, 
available from the Commands menu. Simply start 
the record option, execute any series of actions 
in Dreamweaver, stop, and save them. Then you 
just replay the recording to repeat the actions 
automatically. To use the Recorded Commands 
option, choose Commands➪Start Recording 
and then carefully execute a series of steps 
that you want to be able to repeat. When you 
complete the steps you want to record, choose 
Commands➪Stop Recording and name the 
command to save it. To play the actions back, 
choose Commands➪Play Recorded Command 
and select your new command. Then kick 
back and watch the action; or better yet, take a 
break and get out of your office for a change.

116
Part I: Creating Great Web Sites 
You can also set the number of steps displayed in the History panel by 
choosing Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac) 
and selecting General from the Category list on the left. The default is 50 
steps, more than enough for most users. The higher the number, the more 
memory the History panel uses.
Using the Quick Tag Editor
If you’re one of those developers who likes to work in the Dreamweaver 
Design area, sometimes referred to as the WYSIWYG (what you see is what 
you get) editing environment, but still wants to look at the HTML tags once in 
a while, you’ll love the Quick Tag Editor.
The Quick Tag Editor, as the name implies, lets you quickly access HTML 
tags and enables you to modify, add, or remove an HTML tag without open-
ing the HTML Source window. That means that while you’re in the middle of 
working on a page in design view, you can view the HTML tag you’re working 
on without switching over to code view. You can use the Quick Tag Editor 
to insert HTML, edit an existing tag, or wrap new tags around a selected text 
block or other element.
The Quick Tag Editor opens in one of three modes — Edit, Insert, or Wrap — 
depending on what you selected on the page before you launched the editor. 
Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Mac) to change modes 
while the Quick Tag Editor is open.
You can enter or edit tags in the Quick Tag Editor just as you would in code 
view, without having to switch back and forth between code view and design 
view. To enter or edit tags in the Quick Tag Editor, follow these steps:
 
1. With the document you want to edit open, select an image, text block, 
or other element.
 
 If you want to add new code, simply click anywhere in the file without 
selecting text or an element.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Quick Tag Editor.
 
 You can also press Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Mac). Or, you can right-
click the name of the element tag in the status bar at the bottom of the 
workspace.

117
 Chapter 4: Managing, Testing, and Publishing a Site
 
 The Quick Tag Editor opens in the mode that is most appropriate for 
your selection, as shown in Figure 4-14. For example, if you click an 
image or formatted text, it displays the current tag so that you can edit 
it. If you don’t select anything or if you select unformatted text, the 
Quick Tag Editor opens with nothing in it, and you can enter the code 
you want to add. Press Ctrl+T (Ô+T) to switch to another mode.
 
Figure 4-14: 
You can 
view and 
edit HTML 
tags in 
the Quick 
Tag Editor 
without 
switching to 
code view.
 
 
3. To add a new tag or attribute, simply type the code into the Quick Tag

In this part . . .
T
he best way to create Web designs today is with 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This part introduces 
you to the power and advantages of CSS, with two chap-
ters on creating and using styles.
In Chapter 5, you find an introduction to CSS and a review 
of the CSS features in Dreamweaver. In Chapter 6, you 
move on to creating CSS layouts, using <div> tags and 
other block-level elements to create accessible, flexible 
designs.
In Chapter 7, you find out how to create tables, split and 
merge cells, and use table attributes. You also find tips 
about when to use tables and when CSS is the preferred 
option. In Chapter 8, you get an introduction to frames 
and discover how targeting makes it possible to open a 
link in a specific part of the page. In Chapter 9, you dis-
cover how the Dreamweaver templates can make creating 
Web pages faster, and best of all, how templates can save 
you time when you want to make changes to your page 
designs.

W
ant to add a little style to your pages? Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
are all the rave on the Web and with good reason. CSS is the way 
to create Web sites today if you want to follow the latest standards and 
develop sites that are accessible, flexible, and designed to work on a wide 
range of devices.
The concept of creating styles has been around since long before the Web. 
Desktop publishing programs, such as Adobe InDesign, and even word pro-
cessing programs, such as Microsoft Word, have long used styles to manage 
the formatting and editing of text on printed pages. Using styles in a word 
processor, you can create and save styles for common features, such as 
headlines and captions. In print design, styles are great timesavers because 
they enable you to combine a collection of formatting options, such as Arial, 
bold, and italic, into one style and then apply all those options at once to 
any selected text in your document using a single style. You also have the 
advantage that if you change a style, you can automatically apply the change 
everywhere you’ve used that style in a document.
On the Web, you can do all that and more with CSS because you can use 
styles sheets for even more than just text formatting. For example, you can 
use CSS to create styles that align images to the left or right side of a page, 
add padding around text or images, and change background and link colors. 
You can even create more than one style sheet for the same page: one that 
makes your design look good on computers, another for cell phones, and a 
third a printed page.

122
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
For all these reasons (and more), CSS has quickly become the preferred 
method of designing Web pages among professional Web designers. If you 
haven’t jumped on the CSS bandwagon yet, this chapter is designed to help 
you understand the basics of CSS, to introduce you to Dreamweaver’s many 
CSS features, and to show you how to create and apply tag and class styles to 
text. Even if you’ve been working with CSS for a while, you may appreciate 
the review of CSS and Dreamweaver’s style features before moving on to the 
more complex aspects of CSS covered in the next chapter. In Chapter 6, you 
find instructions for creating ID and Compounds styles, which enable you to 
use CSS to control the position of elements and to create styles that apply 
only to specific sections of a page. The lessons in Chapter 6 will help you 
design page layouts by combining HTML <div> tags and styles, and show 
you how to customize the predesigned CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver.
Introducing Cascading Style Sheets
One of the most powerful aspects of CSS is the way you can use it to make 
global style changes across an entire Web site. Suppose, for example, that 
you create a style for your headlines by redefining the <h1> tag to create 
large, blue, bold headlines. Then one fine day, you decide that all your head-
lines should be red instead of blue. If you aren’t using CSS, changing all your 
headlines could be a huge undertaking — a matter of opening every Web 
page in your site to make changes to the font tags around your headlines. But 
if you’re using CSS in an external style sheet, you can simply change the style 
that controls the headline in the style sheet, and voilá! Your headlines all 
turn red automatically. If you ever have to redesign your site (and believe 
me, every good site goes through periodic redesigns), you can save hours or 
even days of work if you’ve created your design with CSS.
CSS has many other advantages and a remarkably broad scope. The following 
partial list shows some of what you can do with CSS:
 
 Make global changes anywhere a style is applied simply by changing the 
original style in an external style sheet.
 
 Create styles for commonly used elements, such as headlines and 
captions, to create a more consistent design and speed the development 
process.
 
 Define styles that align and position elements, including images, tables, 
and <div> tags.
 
 Control padding and margin spacing with greater precision and add 
different amounts of space to each side of an element.
 
 Define font sizes in fixed or relative sizes with percentages, pixels, picas, 
points, inches, millimeters, ems, and exs (described in the sidebar, 
“Understanding CSS size options,” later in this chapter).

123
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
 Add and remove borders around images, tables, <div> tags, and more. 
You can even add borders to only one side of an element to create 
dividing lines between elements and add visual interest to a page.
 
 Redefine existing HTML tags, such as the unordered list tag, which you 
can redefine to appear in a browser as a horizontal or vertical list with 
or without bullets. You can also replace standard HTML bullets with a 
variety of other bullet styles or an image.
 
 Control the display of a background image defining how and if it repeats 
on a page or within a container, such as a <div> tag or table.
 
 Change link colors, remove link underlining, and create rollover effects 
using text links.
 
 Create multiple styles for the same page. For example, you can create 
one style that uses a large text size for anyone who has trouble reading 
small print on the Web and another that’s optimized for display on a 
small screen, such as a cell phone.
Understanding the basics of styles
Many people find CSS confusing at first because it’s such a different approach 
to design than what you may be used to if you’ve worked in print. The 
following are three of the more confusing aspects of CSS for beginners:
 
 Getting used to thinking about the styles on your site separate from 
your text, images, and other content. For example, instead of simply 
applying formatting directly to a headline to make it bold, green, and 24 
point, in CSS, you create a style for your headline that includes bold, 
green, and 24 point, save that style in a separate place in your document 
or in a separate file called an external style sheets, and then you apply 
the style to one or more headlines as a separate step. As a result, if you 
want to change the way your headline looks later, you don’t go to the 
headline itself in your page to make the change. Instead, you edit the 
style in the style sheet, and it automatically changes any headlines for-
matted with that style.
 
 Understanding all the different kinds of style selectors you can choose 
from, such as class, ID, and tag selectors. No matter how you create 
your styles, each style definition, or rule, contains a selector and a decla-
ration. The selector identifies the name and type of style; for example, 
the selector would be something like #container or .caption. The 
declaration defines the style and describes its properties, such as bold, 
blue, or 300 pixels wide. Dreamweaver’s four selector types are 
described in detail in the section that follows.

124
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Understanding when it’s best to create external style sheets, internal 
style sheets, or inline styles, described in the section “Understanding 
rule definition options.”
And ultimately, you need to understand how CSS and HTML work together. 
So, for example, you can control the positioning and appearance of an HTML 
<div> tag by applying an ID style to the tag, or you can redefine a tag, such 
as the <h1> tag to change the way headlines look on a page.
If you’re starting to feel baffled already (or at any point in this chapter), hang 
in there. After you read through the basic concepts and start creating and 
applying styles, all this should start making more sense. And remember, you 
can always come back and read through any or all these points again. After 
you’ve been using styles for a while, the details in the following sections are 
likely to have more meaning to you, but it’s really hard to start using styles 
before you have a good overview of how they work.
Understanding style selectors
One of the first things you need to understand when you create new styles is 
which selector to use for which job. Each of the selector options has different 
naming restrictions and purposes. If you’re completely new to working with 
styles, this may not make much sense yet, but I encourage you to read 
through all these descriptions of selectors so that you can appreciate your 
options before you move on.
 
Don’t feel you have to memorize all this. Instead, consider folding down the 
corner on this page so you can refer to this list of selectors when you create 
your styles.
The following sections offer a description of each of the four selector option 
available from the New CSS Rule dialog box (as shown in Figure 5-1) in 
Dreamweaver CS4.
 
Figure 5-1: 
The four 
selector 
types.
 

125
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
Class selectors
The class selector is the most versatile selector option. Class styles can be 
used to format any element (from text to images to multimedia), and they can 
be used as many times as you like on any page in a Web site.
Class style names always begin with a period, and you can create class 
styles with any name as long as you don’t use spaces or special characters 
(hyphens and underscores are okay). Thus you could create a style called 
caption for the text that appears before your pictures, and you could create 
a style called photo-credit to format the name of a photographer differently 
from the caption. In that case, your class styles would look like this:
.caption .photo-credit
Dreamweaver helps you with the period (or a dot). If you choose class as 
the selector type and forget to include a dot at the beginning of the name, 
Dreamweaver adds one for you. (Note: Don’t include any space between the 
dot and the style name.)
One other thing that can make styles confusing is that when you apply a class 
style to text or another element, the dot doesn’t appear in the name when 
it’s added to your HTML code. Thus, if you applied the .caption style to a 
paragraph tag to format the text under an image, it would look like this:
<p class=”caption”>This is a photo of an Egret in 
flight.</p>
Class styles must be applied to an element, such as the Paragraph tag shown 
in this example. Class tags can even be added to elements that are already 
defined by other styles.
When you create a class style in Dreamweaver, the style is displayed in the 
CSS Styles panel (as shown in Figure 5-3), and added to the CSS drop-down 
list in the Property inspector (as shown in Figure 5-2).
You can apply class styles using the CSS drop-down list, as shown in Figure 
5-2. It’s common to create styles to align images and other elements to the 
right or left of a page, and styles with the names .float-right and .float-
left are included in most of the predesigned CSS layouts in Dreamweaver. 
These styles commonly include margin spacing to create a little white space 
between an image and text when text is wrapped around the aligned image, 
as shown in Figure 5-2.
For more details and step-by-step instructions for creating and applying 
styles with class selectors, see the section, “Using Class and Tag Styles in 
Dreamweaver,” later in this chapter.

and used

times as you 
like on any 
page.
 
ID selectors
Think of ID styles as the building blocks of most CSS layouts (you find 
out how to create layouts with these styles in Chapter 6). ID styles must 
begin with a pound (#) sign, and, similar to class styles, Dreamweaver 
adds a pound (#) sign to the beginning of the style name automatically if 
you forget to include it. (Note: Don’t include any space between the # and 
the style name.)
The ID selector option is a new addition to the CSS Rule dialog box in 
Dreamweaver CS4 (in CS3, you had to choose the Advanced option to create 
an ID style). Similar to class styles, you can name ID styles anything you like 
as long as you don’t use spaces or special characters (again hyphens and 
underscores are okay). Thus an ID style used to identify the sidebar section 
of a page could look like this:
#sidebar
Similar to class styles, the # sign is not used in the HTML code when a style is 
applied to an element, such as a <div> tag like this:
<div id=”sidebar”>Between these tags with the sidebar ID 
style, you would include any headlines, text, 
or other elements in your sidebar.</div>

127
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
What’s special about ID styles is that they should be used only once per 
page. This makes them ideally suited to formatting <div> tags and other 
block-level elements that are used to create distinct sections in a page. Thus, 
ID styles are great for creating page layouts where you want to define each 
section of a page only once. 
In the predesigned CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver, all the designs are 
created by combining a series of <div> tags with ID styles using names like 
#container, #header, and #footer to identify the main sections of the 
design. In Figure 5-3, you can see how a collection of ID and Class styles are 
displayed in the CSS Styles panel after they’re created. ID styles are also 
added to the ID drop-down list in the Property inspector, making them easy 
to apply to a selected element. 
 
Figure 5-3: 
Styles

with the ID 
selector 
should be 
used only 
once per 
page; they 
are ideal for 
creating a 
CSS layout.
 
Tag selectors
The tag selector is used to redefine existing HTML tags. Select this option, 
shown in Figure 5-4, if you want to change the formatting options for an 
HTML tag, such as the <h1> (heading 1) tag or the <ul> (unordered list) tag.
In many cases, redefining existing HTML tags with CSS has advantages over 
creating new styles. For example, content formatted with the Heading 1 tag is 
well recognized on the Web as the most important text on a page. For that 
reason, many search engines give priority to text formatted with the Heading 
1 tag. Similarly, the hierarchical structure of the <h1>–<h6> tags helps 

128
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
ensure that even if a visitor to your site changes the text size in his or her 
Web browser, text formatted with the Heading 1 tag is still larger relative to 
text formatted with an Heading 2 tag, which is larger than text formatted with 
the Heading 3 tag, and so on.
The ability to change the appearance of headings and other tags with CSS 
makes it possible to retain these advantages while still being able to use the 
font, size, color, spacing, and other formatting options that you prefer in your 
Web design. When you use the tag selector, the style definition is applied 
automatically to any text or other element that’s been formatted with the cor-
responding tag. Thus, if you’ve formatted a headline with the <h1> tag and 
then create a new <h1> style, the formatting you used to define the style will 
apply automatically to the headline as soon as the style is created.
For details on working with tag selectors, see the section “Using Class and 
Tag Styles in Dreamweaver” later in this chapter.
 
Figure 5-4: 
You can 
redefine the 
appearance 
of any HTML 
tag by cre-
ating a style

selector.
 
Creating compound styles
The compound selector can be used to combine two or more style rules to 
create a style definition that displays only when one style is contained within 
another. Compound styles are useful when you want to do something like use 
the Heading 1 tag multiple times to format headlines in different ways on the 
same Web page. For example, you could create one style for headlines that 
appear in the main story area of a page and then create another style for 
headlines that appear in the sidebar on the page and still use the Heading 1 
tag to format both.
Compound styles are created by combining ID, class, or tag styles and look 
like this:
#sidebar h1

129
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
(See Figure 5-5 for an example of how an <h1> style defined like this within a 
#sidebar ID style looks in the New CSS Rule dialog box.) Note that you must 
include a space between each name or tag in a compound style and that you 
don’t include the brackets around tag in a style name. In this example, the 
style definition will apply only to <h1> tags that appear within another 
element, such as a <div> tag with an ID style #sidebar.
If a compound style combines more than one tag, it’s written like this:
#sidebar h1 a:link 
Again, you must include a space between each name or tag. In this example, 
you see a style that defines the appearance of the active link tag only when 
the link is located inside an element formatted with the <h1> tag that’s also 
inside an element formatted with the #sidebar ID. A compound style like 
this makes it possible to create links that look different when they appear in 
a headline in the sidebar of a page than when they appear in another part of 
the sidebar.
After you figure out the differences among these style selector options and 
when they’re best used, you’re well on your way to mastering the art of 
creating Web pages with CSS in Dreamweaver. (Find more information about 
compound styles in Chapter 6.)

130
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Understanding rule definition options
You also have the option of creating internal, external, or inline styles. You 
can even use a combination of these options, or attach multiple external style 
sheets, to the same Web page.
 
 Internal styles: If you create internal styles, the CSS code is stored in the 
<head> area at the top of the HTML page you’re working on, and the 
styles can be applied only to the page in which they were created.
 
 External styles: If you save your styles in an external style sheet, they’re 
stored in a separate file with a .css extension. External style sheets 
can be attached to any or all the pages in a Web site in much the same 
way as you can insert the same image into multiple pages. You can also 
attach multiple external style sheets to the same page. For example, 
you can create one style sheet for styles that format text and another 
for layout styles. You can also create external style sheets for different 
purposes, such as one for print and one for screen display.
 
 Inline styles: Inline styles are created within a document at the place 
that a style is used and only apply to the element they’re attached to in 
the document. These are generally considered the least useful of the 
three style sheet options because any changes to the defined style must 
be made to the code that contains the element, which means you lose 
many of the other benefits of styles, such as the ability to make global 
updates and create very clean, very fast-loading HTML code. For exam-
ple, creating one style for all your headlines and saving it in an external 
style sheet is better than applying the style formatting options to each 
headline separately.
At the bottom of the New CSS Rule dialog box, shown in Figure 5-6, you find a 
Rule Definition drop-down list. Use this list to specify where and how you 
want to save each new style that you define. The options are:
 
 Choose This Document Only to create an internal style that can only be 
used in the open document.
 
 Choose New Style Sheet File to create the new style in an external style 
sheet and create a new external style sheet simultaneously. 
 
 Choose any existing external style sheet that is attached to the page by 
selecting the name of the style sheet from the Rule Definition drop-down 
list. In Figure 5-6, I am selecting an existing style sheet with the name 
main.css.
 
If you are creating a style that you are likely to want to use on more than one 
page in your site, saving the style to a new or existing external style sheet is 
your best choice. If you save a style in an internal style sheet and later decide 
you want to add it to an external style sheet, you can move the style using the 
CSS Styles panel. You find instructions in the “Using External Style Sheets,” 
section later in this chapter.

131
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
Why so many fonts?
Although you can specify any font you want for 
text on your Web pages, you don’t have com-
plete control over how that font appears on 
your visitor’s computer. That’s because the font 
you apply is displayed properly only if your 
visitors have the same font on their hard drives. 
To help ensure that your text appears as you 
intend, Dreamweaver includes collections of 
common fonts, grouped together in families, 
such as Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Georgia, 
Times New Roman, Times, and serif.
Here’s how it works. When you apply a collec-
tion of fonts like these, the browser displays the 
formatted text in the first font available in the 
list. For example, if you choose the font collec-
tion that starts with Georgia and your visitors 
have Georgia on their hard drives, they’ll see 
your text in Georgia. If they don’t have Georgia, 
the text is displayed in the next font on the list 
that your visitors do have. In this case, Times 
New Roman; if they don’t have that font, either, 
the text is displayed in Times; and if they don’t 
even have Times (which would be very unusual), 
the browser looks for any serif font. (In case 
you’re not familiar with font terms, serif 
describes fonts, such as Times, that have those 
little curly things on the edges of letters; sans 
serif means no curly things, which is what you 
get with a font like Arial.)
You can create your own font collections by 
selecting the Edit Font List option from the 
bottom of the Font-Family drop-down list in 
the Property inspector or the Type category of 
the CSS Rule definition dialog box. In the Edit 
Font List dialog box, shown here, use the plus 
and minus buttons at the top of the Edit Font List 
dialog box to add or remove a font collection. To 
add individual fonts to a collection, select the 
font name from the bottom right of the dialog 
box and use the double-left arrows to add it to a 
font list (use the double-right arrows to remove 
a font from a collection).
The only way to ensure that text appears in the 
font you want is to create the text in a graphic 
in a program, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, 
and then insert the graphic with the text into 
your page. That’s not a bad option for special 
text, such as banners or logos, but it’s usually 
not a good option for all your text because 
graphics take longer to download than text and 
are harder to update later.

Looking at the code behind the scenes
If you prefer not to look the code behind your Web pages, it’s helpful to at 
least have some familiarity with different kinds of tags, CSS, and other code 
that Dreamweaver creates for you when you design Web pages. The following 
examples show what the CSS code in an internal or external style sheet 
would look like in Dreamweaver for the following styles:
 
 An ID style created with the ID selector, that is named #container, and 
is defined as 780 pixels wide with the left and right margins set to auto 
(a cool trick for centering a CSS design, covered in detail in Chapter 6).
 
 A style created with a class selector, that is named .caption, and is 
defined as Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, small, italic, and bold. 
 
 A style created with a tag selector to redefine the HTML tag <h1> — as 
Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, large, and bold. (Note: because the Heading 
tags already include bold formatting, it is not necessary to include bold 
in the style definition.)
#container {
 
width: 780px;
 
margin-right: auto;
 
margin-left: auto;
}
.caption {
 
font-family:  Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-
serif;
 
font-size: small;
 
font-style: italic;
 
font-weight: bold;
}
H1 {
 
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
 
font-size: large;
}

133
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
Comparing CSS Rule Options
After you determine what selector type is best for your style and you decide 
whether you want to save it in an external or internal style, you’re done 
with the New CSS Rules dialog box (described in the previous sections). You 
are ready to move on to the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and define the 
formatting and other options you want to include in your style. You find step-
by-step instructions for creating new style rules later in this chapter. This 
section continues the overview to help you better understand your choices 
before you start creating a new style. 
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box includes eight different categories, each 
with multiple options. All these choices can seem a bit daunting at first, 
which is why I’ve included this section with a general overview of the options 
in each category. Again, don’t feel you need to memorize all these options; 
remember, you can always return to this section and use it as a reference 
when you’re creating new styles.
In most cases, you’ll only select a few options from one or two categories for 
each new style you create. Remember, you can always go back and edit 
styles to add or change options. 
 
Not all the options in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box are supported by all 
the Web browsers in use on the Web today, so beware that the way styles are 
displayed on a Web page can vary depending on the browser. Similarly, some 
CSS options aren’t included in Dreamweaver because they’re not commonly 
supported. The following describes the options in each of the categories in the 
CSS Rule Definition dialog box, shown in Figures 5-7 through 5-14.
The Type category
The Type category features a collection of options that control the display 
of (you guessed it) the text in your pages. With the Type category selected 
(see Figure 5-7), you have the following formatting options:
 
 Font-Family: Specifies a font, a font family, or a series of families. You 
can add fonts to the list by choosing Edit Font List in the drop-down list. 
(For an explanation of why Dreamweaver includes font collections and 
how to create new ones, see the sidebar, “Why so many fonts?” earlier in 
this chapter.)
 
 Font-Size: Defines the size of the text. You can choose a specific numeric 
size or a relative size. Use the drop-down arrow to select from a list of 
options including pixels, picas, and percentages. For more on these 
options, see the sidebar “Understanding CSS size options.”

134
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 5-7: 
The Type 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
 
 Font-Style: Enables you to choose whether the text appears as normal, 
italic, or oblique. (Italic and oblique are rarely different in a Web 
browser, so stick with italic unless you have a specific reason not to.)
 
 Line-Height: Enables you to specify the height of a line on which the text 
is placed (graphic designers usually call this leading). You can specify 
line-height in a variety of ways including pixels, picas, and percentages. 
For more on these options, see the sidebar “Understanding CSS size 
options.”
 
 Font-Decoration: Enables you to specify whether text is underlined, over-
lined (a line appears over the text), displayed with a strikethrough, or 
displayed with the blink effect (which makes text appear to flash on and 
off). You can also choose None, which removes all decorative effects.
 
 None is the option you should choose if you want to remove the under-
line from linked text. And please, use the other decoration options spar-
ingly, if at all. Links are underlined automatically, so if you underline text 
that isn’t a link, you risk confusing viewers. Overlined and strikethrough 
text can be hard to read. Use these options only if they enhance your 
design. And by all means, resist the blink effect; it’s distracting and can 
make the screen difficult to read.
 
 Font-Weight: Enables you to control how bold the text appears by using 
a specific or relative boldness option.
 
 Font-Variant: Enables you to select small caps. Unfortunately, this attri-
bute isn’t supported by most browsers.
 
 Font-Transform: Enables you to globally change the case of selected 
words, making them all uppercase, all lowercase, with initial caps, or 
with no capitalization.
 
 Color: Defines the color of the text. You can use the color well (the 
square icon) to open a Web-safe color palette in which you can select 
predefined colors or create custom colors.

 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
After you select the Type options for your style sheet, click Apply to apply 
them, and click OK to save the settings and close the CSS Rule Definition 
dialog box.
The Background category
The Background category in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box (see Figure 
5-8) enables you to specify a background color or image for a style and to 
control how the background will be displayed on the page. You can use back-
ground style settings for any element of your Web page that can display a 
background, including <div> tags and Heading tags. For example, you could 
alter the <body> tag and include background settings that apply to the entire 
page, or you could create an ID style with a background setting that would 
add a background color only to an individual <div> tag. By including the 
background in the ID style of a <div> tag, you can limit the background to 
only display where the <div> tag is used.
Understanding CSS size options
One of the more confusing aspects of CSS is 
that there are so many ways to specify sizes for 
fonts and other elements. If you’re familiar with 
print, you’ll probably recognize point sizes and 
pixel sizes, but these aren’t necessarily the best 
options when you’re designing for the Internet. 
On the Web, where display windows can vary 
from giant monitors to tiny cell phone screens, 
using relative sizes can help you create more 
flexible and adaptable deigns, something you 
can’t do as well with  fixed pixel or point sizes.
Many Web designers prefer to use relative 
sizes, such as the small, medium, and large. The 
advantage of this method is that the font size 
adjusts based on your visitor’s settings while 
maintaining its relative relationship. Thus, text 
formatted as large displays larger than text for-
matted as small, no matter what the default font 
size. This enables you to maintain the hierarchy 
of text elements on a page, even if your user 
alters the default text size on a page (an option 
available to users in most Web browsers).
A variation on this approach is to specify a 
base, page-wide font size  as medium (which is 
the default in most browsers), and then use per-
centages to make text larger or smaller, relative 
to that base size. For example, you could define 
the text in a caption style as 90 percent and 
your caption text would appear at 90 percent of 
the size of the rest of the text on the page. You 
could then make headlines 150 percent, for 
example, and subheads 125 percent.
Another size option is em, which is named after 
the letter M. When you use em as a measure-
ment of size, the size is based on the font size of 
a capital letter M in the font face specified in a 
style. The ex option is similar, but it’s based on 
the size of a lowercase x in the specified font 
face. Although these two options seem more 
complex (especially when you’re new to Web 
design) these two sizes are popular for line 
spacing, as well as other settings, because the 
size is adjusted relative to the displayed text 
size. This can get confusing, but essentially, em 
and ex work similarly to percentages and are 
even better at adapting to different user set-
tings and monitor sizes.

136
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
In the example shown in Figure 5-8, I’ve defined the rule for an ID style named 
#mainContent to include a background image, which I’m further defining 
with the No-Repeat option. Another advantage of CSS is that it includes more 
precise control of background images than is possible with HTML, which by 
default, repeats a background image across and down a page.
 
Figure 5-8: 
The 
Background 
category 
in the 
CSS Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
You can choose from these Background options:
 
 Background-Color: Specifies the background color of a defined style. 
You can use the color well to open a Web-safe color palette in which you 
can select predefined colors or create custom colors.
 
 Background-Image: Enables you to select a background image as part of 
the style definition. Click the Browse button to select the image.
 
 Background-Repeat: Determines how and whether the background 
image tiles across and down the page. In all cases, the image is cropped 
if it doesn’t fit behind the element to which the style is applied. The 
Repeat options are
 
• No-Repeat: The background is displayed once at the top, left of the 
element.
 
• Repeat: The background image repeats vertically and horizontally 
in the background of the element.
 
• Repeat-X: The background repeats horizontally, but not vertically, 
in the background of the element.
 
• Repeat-Y: The background repeats vertically, but not horizontally, 
in the background of the element.

137
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
 Background-Attachment: This property determines how the back-
ground behaves when the page is scrolled.
 
• Fixed: The background remains glued to one place in the viewing 
area and doesn’t scroll out of sight even when the Web page 
is scrolled.
 
• Scroll: The background scrolls along with the Web page.
 
 Background-Position (X): Enables you to align the image left, center, or 
right, or to set a numeric value to determine the precise horizontal 
placement of the background. You can use horizontal positioning only 
with no-repeat or with repeat-y. 
 
 Background Position (Y): Enables you to align the image top, center, 
or bottom, or to set a numeric value to determine the precise vertical 
placement of the background. You can use vertical positioning only with 
no-repeat or repeat-x.
The Block category
The Block category (see Figure 5-9) defines the spacing and alignment 
settings and is commonly used for styles that will define the display of text 
on a Web page.
You can choose from these Block category options:
 
 Word-Spacing: Defines the amount of white space inserted between 
words in points, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), picas, inches, 
pixels, ems, and exs.
 
Figure 5-9: 
The Block 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 

138
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Letter-Spacing: Defines the amount of white space inserted between 
letters in points, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), picas, inches, 
pixels, ems, and exs.
 
 Vertical-Align: Aligns inline elements, such as text and images, in rela-
tion to the elements that surround them. Your options are Baseline, Sub, 
Super, Top, Text-Top, Middle, Bottom, and Text-Bottom, or you can set a 
numeric value. Note that not all Web browsers support all these options.
 
 Text-Align: Enables you to left, right, center, or justify your text. You can 
use this setting, for example, as part of the definition of an ID style when 
you want to align the contents of a <div> tag, such as centering the text 
in a footer.
 
 Text-Indent: Specifies how far the first line of text is indented. Negative 
numbers are allowed if you want the first line to begin off the page.
 
 White-Space: Tells the browser how to handle line breaks and spaces 
within a block of text. Your options are Normal, Pre (for preformatted), 
and Nowrap, which prevents elements from being separated if they 
must wrap to fit within a browser window or other container.
 
 Display: Indicates how to render an element in the browser. For 
example, you can hide an element by choosing None and change the 
positioning of an unordered list from horizontal to vertical, by 
choosing Inline.
The Box category
The Box category (see Figure 5-10) defines settings for positioning and 
spacing. As you can read in Chapter 6, these settings are ideal for creating 
page layouts with ID styles to position <div> tags.
 
Figure 5-10: 
The Box 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 

139
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
You can use the Box category properties to set:
 
 Width: Enables you to specify a width for any element that can have its 
dimensions specified, such as a <div> tag. You can use pixels, points, 
inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, or percentages for 
your measurements.
 
 Height: Enables you to specify a height for any element that can have its 
dimensions specified. Note: The height field is often left empty to enable 
elements, such as <div> tags, to expand to fit their contents.
 
 Float: Enables you to align elements, such as images and <div> tags, 
to the left or right of a page or other container causing text or other 
elements wrap around it.
 
 Clear: Prevents floating content from overlapping an area to the left or 
right, or to both sides of an element. This is a useful option for prevent-
ing overlapping of elements, especially when the Float option is used.
 
 Padding: Sets the amount of space within the borders of an element. For 
example, you can use padding to create space between the borders of a 
<div> tag and its contents. You can set padding separately for the top, 
right, bottom, and left. Padding is measured in pixels, points, inches, 
centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, and percentages.
 
 Margin: Sets the amount of space around the outside of an element. 
Margins can be used to create space between the edge of an element 
and other elements on the page, such as between an image and text 
or between two <div> tags. You can set the margin separately for the 
top, right, bottom, and left. Padding is measured in pixels, points, 
inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, and percentages.
The Border category
The Border category defines settings — such as Width, Color, and Style — 
and are commonly used to define borders around images, tables, and <div> 
tags. As shown in Figure 5-11, you can specify border settings on all four 
sides of an element or create borders only on one, two, or three sides of an 
element. With this technique, you can use the border settings to create 
dividing lines between <div> tags that create columns or add separating 
lines above or below elements.

140
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 5-11: 
The Border 
category

The List category
The List category defines settings, such as the size and type of bullets for list 
tags. You can specify whether bullets are disc, circle, square, decimal, lower-
roman, upper-roman, lower-alpha, upper-alpha, or none (see Figure 5-12). 
Choose None if you want to use the list tag with no bullet. If you want to use a 
custom bullet, you can use the Browse button to insert an image to be used 
as the bullet. You can also control the location of the list bullet in relation to 
the list item. In Chapter 6, you find instructions for redefining the unordered 
list tag to create rollover effects for links, a popular option for creating navi-
gation rows and other collections, or lists, of links.

category

141
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
The Positioning category
The Positioning category (see Figure 5-13) enables you to alter the way 
elements are positioned on a page. As you can read in Chapter 6, positioning 
can dramatically change the way block-level elements appear in a browser. 
Block-level elements include table, list, header, paragraph, and <div> 
tags. For example, AP Divs in Dreamweaver are simply <div> tags that use 
absolute positioning to place elements in a specific part of a page.
 
To understand how positioning works, it’s important to know that positioning 
is always determined relative to something else, such as another element 
on the page or the browser window. How you set up positioning depends on 
where your element is on the page and whether the element is inside another 
element, such as a <div> tag. Here are the Positioning options:
 
 Position: Enables you to specify the position of an element, such as a 
<div> tag. Options include
 
• Absolute: Uses the top and left coordinates to control the position 
of an element relative to the upper-left corner of the browser 
window or the upper-left corner of an element that contains the 
element. (For example, the positioning of an AP Div contained 
within another AP Div is based on the position of the first AP Div.)
 
• Fixed: Positions an element relative to the top-left corner of the 
browser. The content of an element using fixed positioning 
remains constant even if the user scrolls down or across the page.
 
• Relative: Uses a position relative to the point where you insert the 
element into the page or relative to its container.
 
• Static: By default, all HTML elements that can be positioned are 
static, which simply places the content at its location within the 
flow of the document.
 
Figure 5-13: 
The 
Positioning 
category 
in the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 

142
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Width, Height: Enables you to specify a width and height that you can 
use in styles you apply to images, <div> tags, or any other element 
that can have its dimensions specified. These settings are the same as 
the Width and Height in the Box category and entering a value in either 
category caused the same value to appear in the other.
 
 Placement: Defines the size and location of an element within its con-
taining element. For example, you can set the right edge of the element 
to line up with the right edge of the element that contains it. You can 
specify the Top, Right, Bottom, and Left options separately and you can 
use pixels, points, inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, or 
percentages for your measurements.
 
 Visibility: Enables you to control whether the browser displays the 
element. You can use this feature, combined with a scripting language, 
such as JavaScript, to dynamically change the display of elements. For 
example, you can cause an element to appear on a page only when a 
user clicks a button and then make it disappear when the button is 
clicked again. The Visibility options are
 
• Inherit: The element has the visibility of the element in which it’s 
contained. This is the default.
 
• Visible: The element is displayed.
 
• Hidden: The element isn’t displayed.
 
 Z-Index: Controls the position of an element, such as an AP Div, on 
the Z-coordinate, which controls the stacking order in relation to 
other elements on the page. Higher-numbered elements overlap lower-
numbered elements.
 
 Overflow: Tells the browser how to display the contents of an element 
if the container, such as a <div> tag, can’t fit the entire elements 
entire size.
 
• Visible: Keeps content, such as an image or text, visible, even if 
it expands beyond the defined height or width of a container. 
 
• Hidden: Cuts off the contents if they exceed the size of the 
container. This option doesn’t provide scroll bars.
 
• Scroll: Adds scroll bars to the container regardless of whether the 
contents exceed the element’s size.
 
• Auto: Makes scroll bars appear only when a container’s contents 
exceed its boundaries.
 
 Clip: When the content of an element overflows the space allotted and 
you set the Overflow property to Scroll or Auto, you can set the Clip 
settings to specify which part of the element is visible by controlling 
which part of the element is cropped if it doesn’t fit in the display area.

143
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
The Extensions category
Extensions (see Figure 5-14) include filters and cursor options:
 
 Page-Break: Can be set for before or after an element to insert a point in 
a page where a printer sees a page break. This option enables you to 
better control the way a page is printed.
 
 Cursor: Defines the type of cursor that appears when a user moves the 
cursor over an element.
 
 Filter: Enables you to apply special effects, such as drop shadows and 
motion blurs. These are visible only in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
 
Now that you have the overview of all these options, here’s another tip. You 
don’t have to specify any of these settings when you create a new style in 
Dreamweaver. Any options you leave blank are controlled by the browser’s 
default settings or other styles already applied to the page. For example, if you 
don’t specify a text color in a class style named .caption, the text formatted 
with the style will remain black, the default color in most Web browsers, 
unless it has already been formatted by another style, such as a style that 
changes the color of all the text on a page. (You find instructions for changing 
the text color for an entire page in the “Using Page Properties to create styles 
for page-wide settings,” later in this chapter.)

Using the CSS Styles Panel
The CSS Styles panel, as shown in Figures 5-15 and 5-16, provides a great 
place to view, manage, organize, and edit CSS rules. To open the CSS styles 
panel, choose Window➪CSS Styles or click the small double-arrow at the top 
of the panel group and then double-click CSS Styles.

144
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
You can also rename styles in the CSS Styles panel, but be careful. There are 
two ways to rename styles in the CSS Styles panel, and only one automatically 
changes the corresponding HTML code. If you don’t change the name of a 
style in the style sheet and any place the style’s used in your Web site code, 
the style no longer works. See the section, “Editing an existing style,” later in 
this chapter, for details on this important difference and how to rename styles 
without breaking them. You find instructions for organizing style sheets in the 
section, “Moving, copying, and editing styles in an external style sheet,” later 
in this chapter.
When you work with the CSS Styles panel, you can switch between two 
modes, accessible by clicking the All or Current tabs at the top-left of the 
panel. The following sections explain each mode in more detail.
Working with the big picture in All mode
The All tab, which is selected by default, displays a list of all the CSS rules 
defined in a document’s internal style sheet and any attached external style 
sheets. When the CSS Styles panel is in All mode, you can do the following:
 
 See the styles in a style sheet: To view the styles in an internal or 
external style sheet in the CSS Styles panel, click the plus sign (the 
triangle on the Mac) to open the style sheet within the panel. You’ll 
find the arrow (or triangle) next to the <style> tag if you’re using an 
internal style sheet or next to the style sheet name if you’re using an 
external style sheet attached to the page. Figure 5-15 shows a page with 
both internal and external style sheets.
 
 View style properties: Select a style in the CSS Styles panel, and its 
properties are displayed in the Properties pane at the bottom of the CSS 
Styles panel.
 
 Edit styles: Notice in Figure 5-15 that the h1 style is selected in the CSS 
Styles panel, and the definition of the style is displayed in the Properties 
pane at the bottom of the panel. You can edit existing styles by typing or 
using the drop-down lists in the Properties pane (these handy lists appear 
when you place your cursor in a field and are great for making quick 
changes). If you prefer to edit a style in the CSS Rule definition dialog box, 
described in detail in the previous section, double-click any style name 
and it opens automatically in the CSS Rule definition dialog box.
 
If you don’t see any styles listed in the CSS Styles panel when the All tab 
is selected, you probably haven’t defined any styles for the document or 
attached an external style sheet. Occasionally, however, the styles in an 
external style sheet won’t display, even if the name appears in the Styles 
panel. (I’ve seen this happen sometimes when I open a file that was created 
in a previous version of Dreamweaver.) In this case, an easy solution is to 
simply reattach the style sheet by clicking the Attach Style Sheet icon (as 
shown in Figure 5-15), browsing to find the style sheet, and selecting it.

Looking closer at styles in Current mode
When you select the Current tab at the top left of the CSS Styles panel, you 
can view the styles currently applied to any selected element on a page, as 
shown in Figure 5-16.
 
Current mode is useful for identifying how styles are applied to a particular 
element and for troubleshooting when styles conflict.
The Current mode has three sections: the Summary for Selection pane, the 
About pane, and the Properties pane.
 
 In the Summary for Selection pane, you see the rules currently defined 
for the selected style. This pane is especially useful when you’ve created 
a complicated layout and are trying to understand how different styles 
may be affecting the same element.
 
 In the About pane, you see a text description of where a formatting 
option is defined for any rule selected in the Summary of Selection.
 
 In the Properties pane, you can edit, add, or delete style rules just as 
you can in All mode.

Creating, attaching, and listing styles
In the bottom left of the CSS Styles panel, as shown in Figure 5-15, you see 
three small icons that make it easy to change among the Show Category, 
Show List, and Show Only Set Properties views. These options apply to the 
Properties pane in both Current and All modes. Here’s how they work:
 
 Show Category View: Dreamweaver displays all the properties available 
for a selected rule organized by the category to which they belong. For 
example, all the font properties are grouped into a Font category.
 
 Show List View: Dreamweaver displays all the properties available to 
use for a rule organized alphabetically.
 
 Show Only Set Properties: In this view, Dreamweaver displays only the 
properties you’ve defined for a selected rule. This is the default setting, 
and the option shown in Figure 5-15. With this view option, get a quick 
look at the settings for the selected style.
The second set of icons, on the bottom right of the CSS Styles panel (also 
shown in Figure 5-15) aren’t dependent on the view settings. From left to 
right, these icons represent
 
 Attach Style Sheet: Click this icon and browse to find any existing style 
sheet in a site to attach it to the open page.
 
 New CSS Rule: Click this icon to open the New CSS Rule dialog box and 
create a new style.

147
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
 Edit Style: Click this icon to open any style selected in the CSS Styles 
panel in the CSS Rule definition dialog box where you can edit it.
 
 Delete CSS Rule: Select any style name in the CSS Styles panel and click 
this trash icon to delete it.
Switching between CSS and HTML 
Mode in the Property Inspector
In CS4, Dreamweaver added new CSS controls to the Property inspector, a 
welcome addition designed to make it easier to create and edit styles as you 
format text and other elements on your pages.
In previous versions of Dreamweaver, the Property inspector displayed all 
the settings at once, but in CS4, the Property inspector was split into two 
sections. In Figure 5-17, you see the HTML mode of the Property inspector. 
In Figure 5-18, you see the CSS mode. Notice that there are buttons on the 
left side of the Property inspector to make switching between these two 
modes easy.
 
Figure 5-17: 
The HTML 
mode of the 
Property 
inspector.
 
 
Figure 5-18: 
The CSS 
mode of the 
Property 
inspector.
 
If you’re new to CSS and HTML, it can be a little confusing at first to under-
stand the differences between these two modes. Essentially, if you use the 
formatting icons, such as bold and italic, in HTML mode, Dreamweaver 
adds HTML tags and attributes. If you use these same icons in CSS mode, 
Dreamweaver launches the New CSS Rule dialog box so that you can create a 
style that includes these formatting options.

148
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
In CSS mode, you can also choose to edit existing styles to add new format-
ting options to styles that are already applied to the page. This means that 
you can edit existing styles by simply selecting the style from the Targeted 
Rule drop-down list and then using the Font, Size, and other fields in the 
Property inspector to make any changes or additions.
 
Any time you edit an existing style that has already been applied to elements 
on a page, the changes you make to the style are automatically applied 
anywhere the style is used.
On the other hand, say you want to apply an existing style to an element on 
the page. For example, if you want to align an image with a class style or 
apply an ID style to a <div> tag, you want to be in HTML mode. To apply a 
style in this mode, select the element in the page where you want to apply 
the style and then use the Class or ID drop-down lists to select the style; 
Dreamweaver automatically applies it.
Similarly, if you want to apply an HTML tag, such as the Heading 1 tag, you 
want to be in HTML mode, but if you want to create or edit a CSS rule for the 
H1 tag, you want to do that from the CSS mode.
Using Class and Tag Styles 
in Dreamweaver
In the following sections, you find instructions for putting Dreamweaver’s 
style features to use to create, apply, and edit styles with the class and tag 
selectors. In Chapter 6, you find instructions for working with styles created 
with the ID and compound selectors.
 
As you go through the steps to create a new style in Dreamweaver, you may 
be surprised by the number of options in the many panels and dialog boxes 
available for creating CSS. Remember, you can always refer to the descriptions 
of these many options, which are covered in detail in the earlier sections of 
this chapter. 
Creating styles with the class selector
Using styles to format text in Dreamweaver is a relatively simple process. 
First, you define a style and then, as you see in the following steps, you apply 
it to an element on the page. In this section, you walk through the process of 
creating a class style that can be applied to any element on a page. In this 
example, you’ll create a .caption class style and then, in the next section, 
you’ll use .caption to format the text under a photo.

149
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
To define a new class style, create a new document or open an existing file, 
and then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the New CSS Rule icon at the bottom of the 
CSS Styles panel (refer to Figure 5-15).
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-19.
 
Figure 5-19: 
The New 
CSS Rule 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Choose a selector type.
 
 To create a class style, choose (you guessed it) Class from the Selector 
Type drop-down list.
 
3. In the Selector Name field, type a new name for the style beginning 
with a dot (.).
 
 For this example, type .caption.
 
 You can name a class style anything you like, as long as you don’t use 
spaces or punctuation, but class style names must begin with a dot (.). If 
you choose the Class option and neglect to enter a dot at the beginning 
of the name, Dreamweaver adds one for you.
 
4. From the Rule Definition drop-down list, choose This Document Only 
to create the new style in an internal style sheet.
 
 An internal style sheet applies only to the current page. When you select 
this option, the style will be created and added to the top of the open 
HTML page in the <head> section.
 
 If you prefer, you can choose the New Style Sheet File option to create a 
new external style sheet as you create the style, or you can use the 

150
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
drop-down list to select any existing style sheet already attached to the 
page and add the new style to it.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-20.
 
6. Choose a category from the left of the CSS Rule Definition dialog box.
 
 For this example, choose the Type category, as shown in Figure 5-20. 
(For a detailed description of each of the categories, refer to the 
“Comparing CSS Rule Options” section, earlier in this chapter.)
 
Figure 5-20: 
The Type 
category 
of the CSS 
Rule 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
 
7. In the Font-Family field, choose a font list collection from the 
drop-down list or enter the name of a font.
 
 For this example, I chose Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. To use a font that 
isn’t included, choose the Edit Font List option from the drop-down 
list and create a new font list using your own fonts. (For more on using 
fonts on the Web, see the sidebar, “Why so many fonts?” earlier in this 
chapter.)
 
8. In the Font-Size drop-down list, choose the size you want for your 
caption style.
 
 For this example, I chose Small. You can specify text sizes in pixels, 
picas, mm, and several other measurements. For an explanation of 
options, see the sidebar “Understanding CSS size options,” earlier in 
this chapter.
 
9. In the Font-Style drop-down list, choose a font style.
 
 In this example, I chose Italic.
 
10. In the Font-Weight drop-down list, choose a weight.
 
 For this example, I chose Bold.

151
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
11. Click the color well and choose a color for the style.
 
 Sticking to the default color swatches in the color well (the square icon) 
is certainly the quickest way to choose a color, but you can also create 
custom colors by clicking the icon that looks like a rainbow-colored globe 
in the upper-right corner of the color well and selecting a color from the 
System Color Picker. For this example, I chose a dark green color.
 
12. Click OK.
 
 The new style name is added to the CSS panel, as shown in Figure 5-21, a 
little later in this chapter. If the new style isn’t visible, click the plus sign 
(+) (or triangle on the Mac) next to the <style> tag to reveal the rules 
in the current style.
 
When you create a class style, such as the .caption style in this example, it’s 
also added to the Class drop-down list in the Property inspector, as you see in 
the following section.
Applying class styles in Dreamweaver
Defining class styles in Dreamweaver is the time-consuming part. Applying 
them after you define them is the time-saving part. How you apply a style 
depends on the kind of style you’ve created. To apply a class style in 
Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an existing document or create a new one and add some text, 
and then click and drag to select the text or other element to which 
you want to apply a style.
 
 In this example, I’ve selected the text under the photograph in the page 
shown in Figure 5-21.
 
2. In the Property inspector (with the HTML features displayed), select 
the style from the Class drop-down list.
 
 Notice that Dreamweaver provides a preview of the style by formatting 
the name in the drop-down list based on the specified options in the 
style definition (in this example, the .caption style is displayed as 
bold, italic, and green). When you choose a style, the selected text or 
other element automatically changes in the Document window to reflect 
the application of the style. In Figure 5-21, you see the caption style cre-
ated in the previous exercise applied to the text below the photograph.
 
Another way to apply a style is to select an image, text, or other element and 
then choose the name of the style from the menu you see when you choose 
Format➪CSS Styles. You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac), 
choose CSS Styles, and select a style name from the list of defined styles. I 
like to use the Property inspector because it’s the only method that lets you 
preview how the style appears before applying it.

152
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 5-21: 
To apply a 
class style, 
select the 
text or other 
element in 
the main 
workspace, 
and then 
choose the 
style from 
the Class 
drop-down 
list in the 
Property 
inspector.
 
Removing class styles in Dreamweaver
To remove a class style from a selected text block or other element, make 
sure the Property inspector is in HTML mode, select the element where the 
style is applied in the Web page, and choose None from the Class drop-down 
list in the Property inspector (you can see this option in Figure 5-21). 
You can also remove a style by right-clicking the tag the style is applied to in 
the tag selector at the very bottom of the workspace. The tag selector is a 
great feature for quick edits and for identifying elements on the page. As you 
see in Figure 5-22, when you right-click a tag name, a pop-up menu appears. 
If you don’t see the tag that you want to edit in the tag selector, click to select 
the element in the Web page and the corresponding tag should appear in the 
tag selector. To remove or change a style using the tag selector, right-click 
the tag and then choose Class➪Set Class➪None to remove it, or select 
another class style from the menu to change the applied style.
Creating styles with the tag selector
In addition to creating new class styles, you can create styles that redefine 
existing HTML tags. When you create a style in the New CSS Rule dialog box 
using the tag selector option, you can alter the appearance, position, and 
other features of any an existing HTML tag. 

153
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
Figure 5-22: 
You can 
use the tag 
selector at 
the bottom 
left of the 
Dream-
weaver 
workspace 
to remove a 
style or tag.
 
Because HTML tags already include formatting options, (for example, the 
Heading tags include formatting to style text in large and bold), when you 
create a style with a Tag selector, you have to consider the formatting 
options already associated with that tag. Any options you specify in the CSS 
Rule Definition dialog box will either be added to the existing formatting cre-
ated by the tag, or the new rules will override the existing style. For example, 
in the exercise that follows, I redefine the <h1> tag by changing the headline 
font to Georgia, which will take the place of the default font Times, but I don’t 
need to make bold part of the style definition because it’s already included in 
the style for an <h1> tag.
When you redefine an existing HTML tag, you don’t need to apply the style 
for the formatting to change. Wherever you’ve applied the HTML tag, the 
style definition settings are applied automatically.
You may ask “Why would I redefine the <h1> tag instead of just creating a 
new headline style as a class style?” or “What’s the best scenario for using 
each of these options?” In “Creating styles with the class selector” earlier 
in this chapter, you find out how to create a new style class that you can 
selectively apply to any block of text on your page. But at times, using an 
existing HTML tag is better. Heading styles are especially important because 
they’re well recognized on the Web as indicators of the most important text 
on a page.
To redefine an HTML tag, such as the <h1> tag, with the tag selector, create a 
new file or open an existing one and then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click (Option-click on a Mac) anywhere 
in the CSS panel and choose New, or you can click the New CSS Rule 
icon at the bottom right of the CSS panel. The icon looks like a small 
plus (+) sign.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-23.

154
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. Choose Tag from the Selector Type drop-down list.
 
3. Choose the HTML tag you want to redefine from the Selector Name 
drop-down list.
 
 You can also type to enter the name of a tag into the Selector Name field. 
In this example, I selected h1 to redefine the H1 heading tag.
 
Figure 5-23: 
Use the tag 
selector to 
redefine 
an existing 
HTML tag, 
such as the 
<h1> tag.
 
 
4. From the Rule Definition drop-down list, choose the This Document 
Only option to create the new style in an internal style sheet.
 
 If you prefer, you can choose the New Style Sheet File option to create a 
new external style sheet as you create the style, or you can use the 
drop-down list to select any existing style sheet already attached to the 
page and add the new style to it.
 
 An internal style sheet applies only to the current page. When you select 
this option, the style is created and added to the top of the open HTML 
page in the <head> section.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule definition dialog box opens.
 
6. Choose a category and specify the options you want to use to redefine 
the new tag style.
 
 For this example, I redefined the <h1> tag to use the Georgia font 
instead of the default browser font, changed the size to extra large, and 
changed the text color to dark green.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 Any text or other element that you’ve already formatted with the HTML 
tag immediately changes to reflect the formatting in the new tag style 
definition.

155
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
If you want to be able to use the same HTML tag with different style defini-
tions, you can create compound styles, as described in Chapter 6. See 
“Understanding style selectors” earlier in this chapter for an introduction to 
the different types.
Editing an existing style
You can change the attributes of any style after you create it by editing its 
style definitions. This is where some of the biggest advantages of Cascading 
Style Sheets come into play. You can make global changes to a page or even 
to an entire Web site by changing a style because when you edit the style, 
the changes are automatically applied to every element where you used the 
style. This is one of the reasons that external style sheets are so valuable 
because you can create styles that are used on any or all the pages in a site. 
Beware, however, that this can also lead to problems. If you decide that you 
want to edit a style when you use it on a new page, don’t forget that you’ll 
be changing the formatting everywhere else you’ve already used that style. 
In some cases, you may be better off creating new styles, rather than editing 
old styles.
 
You can create new styles by duplicating an existing style, giving it a new 
name, and then altering the style definitions. This is a time-saving trick when 
you want to create a new style that is similar to an existing one.
To edit an existing style, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the CSS Styles panel by choosing Window➪CSS Styles.
 
2. Select the name of an existing style in the CSS panel.
 
 The corresponding definition settings are displayed in the Properties 
pane below it.
 
3. Select any of the settings in the Properties pane and edit them.
 
 Alternatively, you can double-click the name of any style in the CSS 
Styles panel to launch the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and edit the 
style there.
 
• If you edit a style definition in the Properties panel, the changes 
are applied automatically as soon as you press the Return or Enter 
key or click outside the formatting field in the panel.
 
• If you edit a style in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, changes 
are applied automatically when you click the Apply button. 
 
4. Click OK to apply the changes and close the dialog box.

156
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Renaming existing styles
 
You can rename a CSS style in the CSS Styles panel in much the same way 
you’d rename a filename in the Files panel, by clicking to select the name and 
then typing a new name. Beware, however, that renaming a style in this way 
doesn’t change its corresponding reference in the HTML code of your Web 
pages. If you change a name in the CSS Styles panel by simply typing a new 
name like this, you must also manually change the name in the corresponding 
page code, which can get complicated if you’ve used the style in many places.
For example, if you create an .imagecaption style and apply it to text in 
your Web page, and then later you decide to shorten the name of the style to 
.caption, make sure that every place you’ve used that style in your site is 
updated in the code where it’s been applied, or the link to the style sheet will 
be broken.
 
If you want to rename a style and update the style references in the code 
at the same time, open any page where the style is used and follow these 
instructions:
 
1. Open the CSS Styles panel by choosing Window➪CSS Styles.
 
2. Right-click (Control-click) the name of an existing style in the CSS 
panel.
 
3. Choose Rename Class, as shown in Figure 5-24.
 
 The Rename dialog box opens. (If you select a style created with another 
selector type, the options change. For example, if you select an ID style, 
the option will be Rename ID.)
 
4. Type a new name in the New name field and click OK.
 
 If you’ve already applied the style and the style is saved in an external 
style sheet, a dialog box opens offering to “Use Find and Replace to fix 
the documents that use this style?”. 
 
 If the style you want to rename is saved in an internal style sheet, the 
name will automatically be changed in the code anywhere the style has 
been applied. With internal style sheets, the Find and Replace dialog box 
does not open and you do not have all the options in this exercise. 
However, any changes that are made will be displayed in the Results 
panel, which automatically opens at the bottom of the workspace. 
 
5. Click Yes to automatically update references to the style in the code 
with the new style name.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box opens (see Figure 5-25) with the 
necessary search strings already filled in. Don’t change these settings 
unless you know what you’re doing with these advanced search strings 
and want to alter the way Dreamweaver renames the style.

6. Click Replace All to automatically update all references to the style in

 Dreamweaver warns you that this operation can’t be undone, but you 
can always rename the style again by repeating these steps if you 
change your mind.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Using Page Properties to Create Styles 
for Page-Wide Settings, such as Links
If you’re like many designers, you probably don’t like the underline that auto-
matically appears under all the linked text in a Web page. In this section, you 
discover how easy it is to remove that underline and change the color, font 
face, and size for the links with Dreamweaver’s Page Properties dialog box. 
You can also change other page-wide settings, such as the background color 
and page margins, from the Page Properties dialog box.
Although you can change link styles by redefining the anchor tag, as you’d 
create any style with a tag selector, the easiest way to alter all your link 
styles at once is to change them in the Page Properties dialog box. When you 
use this option, Dreamweaver automatically creates the corresponding tag 
selector styles and lists them in the CSS Styles panel. Other page-wide set-
tings in this dialog box work similarly.
To change hyperlink and other styles with the Page Properties dialog box, 
open an existing page or create a new one and follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Page Properties button in the Property 
inspector. The Page Properties dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Appearance (CSS) category, which is displayed when the Page 
Properties dialog box opens, you can specify page-wide font options, 
set a background color or image, and adjust the margins on a page.
  
 When you alter these settings, Dreamweaver automatically creates a 
new style rule for the Body tag. If you want to edit these settings further 
in the future, you can do so by editing the Body tag or by returning to 
the Page Properties dialog box.
 
3. Select the Links (CSS) category on the left of the Page Properties 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-26.
 
4. Specify a font face and size for your links.
 
 If you want to use the same font size and face for your links as you use in 
the rest of the text on your page, it’s best to leave these options blank; 
then if you change the text settings for the page, you won’t have to 
remember to change them for your links as well.
 
5. Specify colors for each hyperlink state by clicking in the correspond-
ing color well and selecting a color from the Color dialog box.
 
 You can change any or all the link color settings. If you don’t specify a 
link color, the browser uses the default link color. Here’s an explanation 
of each of the four link states:

159
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
• Link Color: The color in which your links appear when the page is 
first loaded and the linked page hasn’t yet been visited by the 
browser. The corresponding HTML tag is <a:link>.
 
• Visited Links: The color your links change to after a browser has 
already viewed the linked page. The corresponding HTML tag is 
<a:visited>.
 
• Rollover Links: The color a link changes to as a user rolls a cursor 
over a link. The corresponding HTML tag is <a:hover>.
 
• Active Links: The color a link changes to as a user is actively 
clicking a link. The corresponding HTML tag is <a:active>.
 
6. Select a style from the Underline Style drop-down list.
 
 Many designers prefer to remove the underline that automatically 
appears under linked text by choosing Never Underline, as shown in 
Figure 5-26.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 The Page Properties dialog box closes, the style settings are automati-
cally applied to any links on the page, and the corresponding styles are 
added to the CSS panel.
 
To fully test link styles, preview your page in a Web browser or click the Live 
View button at the top of the workspace. It’s good practice to test link settings 
in a browser when you make changes like the ones in the preceding exercise. 
Take a look at how your links appear; for example, do the active and visited 
link colors look good against the background color of the page. Remember 
that any styles you create using the Page Properties dialog box affect all links 
on your page unless you specifically apply a different style to an individual 
link that overrides the redefined tag style. If you want to use different link 
styles in different parts of the same page, you can create compound styles, 
covered in Chapter 6.

Properties 
dialog box

states.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Using External Style Sheets
External style sheets (or linked style sheets) offer the greatest advantages 
with CSS. You can define styles for common formatting options used 
throughout an entire site, such as headlines, captions, and even images, 
which makes applying multiple formatting options to elements fast and easy. 
Using external style sheets also makes global changes easier because when 
you change a style in an external style sheet, you automatically change every 
element to which you applied the style throughout the site.
 
Internal style sheet information is stored in the Head section of the HTML 
code of the document you’re working on, and styles in an internal style sheet 
can be applied only to the current document. If you want to create styles that 
you can share among multiple documents, use external style sheets. Don’t 
worry if you’ve already created a bunch of styles in an internal style sheet and 
now wish they were in an external one — as you’ll discover in this exercise, 
it’s easy to move styles from one kind of style sheet to another.
Creating an external style sheet
You create external style sheets almost exactly the same way you create 
internal style sheets, except that external style sheets need to be saved as 
separate files. When you use Dreamweaver to create a new style, you have 
the option of creating that style in a new or existing external style sheet. If 
you choose to create a new style in a new external style sheet, Dreamweaver 
automatically creates the new file as you create the style and attaches the 
new style sheet to the page you’re working on.
If you prefer, you can create a new CSS file just as you’d create any other new 
file in Dreamweaver by choosing File➪New and then selecting CSS in the New 
Document dialog box. If you choose this option, attach the style sheet to the 
page you’re working on as a separate step by choosing Format➪CSS Styles➪
Attach Style Sheet or by clicking the Attach Style Sheet icon at the bottom of 
the CSS Styles panel.
 
You must attach an external style sheet to every page where you want the 
styles to be used. When a style sheet is attached to a Web page, all the style 
definitions included in the style sheet become available for that page from the 
CSS Styles panel.
To create an external style sheet as you create a new style, follow these 
steps:

161
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
1. Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose a selector from the Selector Type drop-down list.
 
 The four options — Class, ID, Tag, and Compound — are described in 
detail in the “Understanding style selectors” section, earlier in this 
chapter.
 
3. Type a name into the Selector Name field or select an option from the 
Selector Name drop-down list.
 
4. Choose New Style Sheet File from the Rule Definition drop-down list.
 
 This is the crucial step in creating a new external style sheet as you 
create the new style.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Save Style Sheet File As dialog box opens.
 
6. Select a location in which to save the style sheet file.
 
 Note that you should save the style sheet in the root folder of your Web 
site. You can save your CSS files in a subfolder, but remember that you 
must upload the CSS file to your Web server when you publish the site 
for the styles to work. (For more information on the root folder and how 
to define a site in Dreamweaver, see Chapter 2.)
 
7. Enter a name for the style sheet in the File Name field.
 
 You can name your style sheets anything you like; just don’t use any 
spaces or special characters (hyphens and underscores are okay). 
Dreamweaver automatically adds the .css; just make sure you don’t 
delete it.
 
8. Click Save.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
 
9. Define the new style rule specifying all formatting options you want 
applied with the new style.
 
 You find detailed descriptions of these options in the “Comparing CSS 
Rule Options” section earlier in this chapter.
 
10. Click OK to save the new style, close the dialog box, and create the 
new external style sheet simultaneously.
 
 Your new style is automatically saved in the new external style sheet 
and listed in the CSS Styles panel.

162
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
You must attach this external style sheet to every page where you want 
to use the styles that are saved in it. See the next section for step-by-step 
instructions.
Attaching an external style 
sheet to a Web page
After you create an external style sheet, you’ll likely want to attach it to 
additional Web pages. Begin by opening the page to which you want to attach 
the style sheet and then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪CSS Styles.
 
 The CSS panel appears.
 
 
2. Click the Attach Style Sheet icon in the CSS panel (the first button in 
the lower-right area).
 
 The Attach External Style Sheet dialog box appears (as shown in 
Figure 5-27).
 
3. Click the Browse button and locate the CSS file in your site folder.
 
 You can also enter a URL if you want to use a remote CSS file located on 
another Web site, but it’s most common to use a style sheet contained 
within the Web site you’re working on. Either way, Dreamweaver auto-
matically sets the link to the style sheet for you, includes the style 
sheet link code at the top of the HTML file, and lists all the styles in the 
external style sheet in the CSS panel.
 
4. Select the Link or Import option.
 
 If you’re attaching a style sheet to an HTML file, your best choice is 
almost always to choose Link, which is the default option. Choose 
Import if you want to create one master external style sheet that 
contains references to other style sheets, an advanced option that 
enables one style sheet to refer to another.
 
5. In the Media drop-down list, choose an option.
 
 With the Media drop-down list, you can specify the intended use for 
the style sheet. For example, if you’ve created a style sheet that for-
mats your page for printing, choose the Print option. You can leave this 
option blank if you’re attaching a style sheet to control the way the page 
will appear in a browser.

163
 Chapter 5: Cascading Style Sheets
 
Figure 5-27: 
The Attach 
External 
Style Sheet 
dialog box.
 
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the external CSS file is automatically linked 
to the page. Any styles you’ve defined in the external style sheet appear 
in the CSS Styles panel, listed under the name of the style sheet, and all 
the styles automatically become available for use on the page. In Figure 
5-28, you can see that the main.css style sheet has been added to the 
CSS Styles panel. Internal style sheets are simply listed as <style>.
 
You can attach multiple style sheets to the same HTML page. For example, 
you can save all your text styles in one style sheet and all your layout 
styles in another and then attach both to the same document to make all the 
defined styles available to the page. Similarly, you create different style 
sheets for different purposes, such as one for printing the file and another for 
browser display.
Moving, copying, and editing styles 
in an external style sheet
After you attach an external style sheet to a document, you can move, copy, 
and edit styles as follows:
 
 Moving styles: Move any internal styles into the external style sheet by 
simply clicking the name of a style in an internal style sheet in the CSS 
Styles panel and dragging it onto the name of an external style sheet. In 
Figure 5-28, you can see that I’m moving a body style from the internal 
style sheet, which by default is <style>, into the external style sheet 
main.css. If you have attached more than one external style sheet to a 
document, you can also move styles from one external style sheet to 
another using click and drag.

164
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 5-28: 
Click and 
drag to 
move styles 
from an 
internal to 
an external 
style sheet.
 
 
 Copying styles: You can copy styles from one document to another 
by right-clicking (Control-clicking on a Mac) a style name in the CSS 
Styles panel, choosing Copy, and then opening the document where 
you want to add the style, right-clicking (Control-clicking on a Mac) the 
name of an internal or external style sheet in the CSS Styles panel, and 
choosing Paste.
 
 Editing styles: You edit styles in an external style sheet the same way 
you edit styles in an internal style sheet: by clicking or double-clicking 
the style name in CSS Styles panel. (For more detailed instructions, see 
the section “Editing an existing style,” earlier in this chapter.) Any 
changes you make to a style in an external style sheet are applied auto-
matically to all the files to which the external style sheet is attached 
(remember, you must upload the style sheet to your Web server for the 
changes to take effect on the published version of the site).
If you want to edit a remote CSS file, download the file to your hard drive 
before you open it in Dreamweaver. In Dreamweaver, you open .css files by 
double-clicking them or choosing File➪Open, both of which open the style 
sheet in code view. Code view is the only view available for CSS files because 
they’re text files and have no layout components. When you view an external 
style sheet this way, you can still use the CSS panel to edit any defined styles, 
even if the style sheet isn’t linked to an HTML page. Be sure to save it when 
you finish editing it!
If you prefer, you can also edit the code by hand directly in code view. Figure 
5-29 shows an example of a style sheet opened directly in Dreamweaver. 
Notice that the CSS Styles panel displays all relevant style information and 
gives you access to the CSS editing tools.
 
When you edit an external style sheet, you must upload it to your server 
before the style changes can be applied to pages on your live Web site.

165

Using ready-made external style sheets
Adobe includes several sample style sheets for you to use in your Web sites. 
These come in the form of external style sheets that have been created with 
some popular styles to give you a jump-start in designing your pages. You 
can use these styles as-is or modify them to suit your needs.
To create a new external style sheet using one of the sample style sheets 
provided by Adobe, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-30.
 
2. Choose Page from Sample.
 
3. In the Sample Folder list, select CSS Style Sheet to display the list of 
CSS style collections
 
4. Select any of the sample styles listed under Sample Page.
 
 A preview of styles is displayed in the far right of the New Document 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-30.

 A new, untitled style sheet opens in code view.
 
6. Choose File➪Save (or Save As) and save the new style sheet in the 
root folder of the site where you plan to use it.
To use the styles in a document, attach the new style sheet to an open file by 
following the instructions in the section “Attaching an external style sheet to 
a Web page,” earlier in this chapter.
When you do save a CSS file created from a sample style collection, 
Dreamweaver leaves the original style collection unchanged.

hether you’re new to CSS or you’ve been struggling (I mean design-
ing) with styles for years, Dreamweaver’s many CSS features offer 
welcome assistance to even the most experienced designers.
One of the challenges with CSS is still a relatively new addition to the world 
of Web design, and browser support — which can make the difference 
between a beautiful Web page and a jumbled design that’s unreadable — 
continues to change and evolve.
So Adobe dedicated the equivalent of decades of time (at least in Internet 
years) to designing a collection of CSS layouts that you can use to get a head 
start on many common page designs. Whether you’re creating static HMTL 
pages or dynamic, database-driven sites with PHP, you can customize 
Dreamweaver’s pre-styled layouts to create a broad range of Web site 
designs that are designed to display well in a wide-range of Web browsers. 
The first part of this chapter shows you how to work with these layouts and 
how to edit them to create your own designs.
If you prefer, you can create your own custom CSS layouts, and you find a few 
tips for doing so in the second part of this chapter. You also find instructions 
for creating a collection, or list, of links for a navigation bar using the <ul> 
tag, an increasingly recommended way to develop accessible navigation 
features.

168
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Before you start this chapter, I recommend you at least skim through Chapter 
5, where you find an introduction to CSS, a review of the many panels, 
dialog boxes, and inspectors you can use to create, apply, and edit styles in 
Dreamweaver, as well as instructions for creating CSS styles with class and 
tag selectors.
In this chapter, you move on to more advanced uses of CSS with instructions 
for creating styles with ID and compound selectors to position and align 
images, text, and other elements on a Web page.
Brace yourself. You’re getting into some of the most complex Web design 
features that Dreamweaver has to offer, but I think you’ll find the power and 
precision of these options well worth the effort. If you want to create Web 
designs that display well in a variety of browsers, screen sizes, and devices, 
and you want to ensure that your pages meet the latest Web standards, and 
are accessible to special Web browsers used by the disabled, CSS is clearly 
your best option. You start with customizing one of the predesigned layouts 
in Dreamweaver and then move on to creating custom CSS features from 
scratch.
Using CSS Layouts in Dreamweaver
Before you rush off to check out all the CSS layouts included in Dreamweaver, 
let me warn you: They’re not much to look at when you first open them. 
They’re intentionally designed with the most basic of formatting options 
and a dull gray color scheme — but fortunately color styles are some of the 
easiest to alter in CSS.
Comparing CSS layout options
Dreamweaver includes a variety of CSS layouts, 
designed with four distinct approaches to CSS. 
You’ll find a longer description of each of these 
layout types in Dreamweaver’s Help files, but 
essentially
  Liquid layouts are designed to expand and 
contract depending on the size of the 
browser window.
  Fixed layouts are centered within the 
browser and set to a width of 780 pixels.
  Elastic layouts use the ems measurement 
to adapt to different text sizes and other 
variations in display.
  Hybrid layouts use a mix of options.
In the examples shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2, I’ve 
selected a design that creates a two-column, 
fixed layout, with a header and footer. In general, 
fixed layouts are an easier option to start with, but 
there are advantages to liquid designs because 
they’re more flexible.

169
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
If you know the basics of editing styles, covered in the Chapter 5, you can 
adjust the width of columns, the formatting styles for text, and the alignment 
of any element on the page relatively easily. If you’re new to CSS, altering one 
of these layouts may seem confusing at first, but trust me, it’s certainly easier 
than creating a design from scratch.
Creating a new page with a CSS layout
No matter what you’re experience level, the following tutorials are designed 
to help you appreciate how Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts work, and to help 
you customize the layouts step-by-step to create your own page designs.
Figure 6-1 shows what a Dreamweaver CSS layout looks like when it’s 
first created. Figure 6-2 shows the same layout after it’s been customized. In 
the steps that follow, you find detailed instructions for editing this CSS 
layout. Although you find many different layout designs to choose from in 
Dreamweaver, the basic process for editing the CSS rules to customize one of 
these layouts is the same for them all.

Web site 
designs.
 
To create a new page using one of Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts, follow these 
instructions:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box appears (see Figure 6-3).
 
2. Choose Blank Page from the left column and HTML from the Page 
Type column in the middle.
 
 If you’re working on a dynamic site, you can choose any of the options 
in the bottom part of the Page Type section, including ASP.NET, PHP, or 
ColdFusion and still use a CSS layout.
 
3. Select any of the CSS layouts listed in the Layout section.
 
 For this example, I chose 2 Column Fixed, Left Sidebar, Header and 
Footer.
 
 Notice in Figure 6-3, that when you select a CSS layout, a preview of the 
layout is displayed in the top right of the dialog box.
 
4. From the Layout CSS drop-down list, choose the type of style sheet you 
want to create as you create the page.
 
 Choose Add to Head to create an internal style sheet and include all the 
styles for the layout in the Head area of the new document.

171
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
 Choose Create New File to create a new external style sheet with all the 
page styles as you create the new document with the design.
 
 Choose Link to Existing File to add the style sheet information for the 
new document to an existing style sheet.
 
5. Click Create.
 
 It’s important to save all the pages of a Web site in the root folder. You 
find more about defining a Web site and specifying a root folder in 
Dreamweaver in Chapter 2.
 
Figure 6-3: 
When you 
select the 
name of a 
CSS layout 
in the New 
Document 
dialog box, 
a preview is 
displayed in 
the top-right 
corner.
 
 
6. Choose File➪Save to save the page and styles.
 
 If you saved the styles in an external style sheet, you’re prompted by a 
second dialog box to save the style sheet separately. If the styles are 
contained in an internal style sheet, they’re saved automatically when 
you save the page.
Removing class styles from CSS layouts
All the CSS layouts in Dreamweaver are identi-
fied by a class style, such as .twoColFix
LtHdr used in the layout shown in the style 
used in these two exercises. These class names 
are made up of abbreviations for the layout. In 
this case, .twoColFixLtHdr describes this 
layout as a two-column design with a fixed size, 
a left sidebar, and a header.
These class names are included at the begin-
ning of each of the ID styles in this CSS layout, 
making all the ID styles compound styles, which 
can make identifying the IDs a bit more confus-
ing. These styles work with this class style at 
the beginning because the class is attached to 
the <body> tag of the code in the page. Even 
though .twoColFixLtHdr isn’t defined by 
(continued)

172
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
(continued)
any rules, its presence in the <body> tag and 
at the beginning of the name of each of the 
ID styles enables the styles in this layout to 
work properly.
This class style can be handy for identifying the 
selected layout, but it also complicates the style 
names in a way that isn’t necessary. If you want 
to simplify the style names in a design like this, 
you can remove the class style — just make 
sure you remove it from both the <body> tag 
and the style names of each ID style in the CSS 
Styles panel.
To remove a class style, follow these 
instructions:
 1. Click the Split view button at the top of the 
workspace to view the code in split view, 
as shown in this figure.
 2. Find the <body> tag in the code (it appears 
just after any CSS styles and just before the 
content of the page begins).
 3. Delete everything but the <body> tag and 
brackets.
 
 In this example, you’d delete class=
”twoColFixLtHdr” (including the 
space) and leave <body>. When you do 
this, all the links to the ID styles break, and 
the page layout loses all the correspond-
ing formatting, which changes the appear-
ance dramatically. Don’t worry. You can 
get it all back by following the next steps.
 4. Select just the class name at the beginning 
of an ID style in the CSS Styles panel and 
press the Delete or Backspace key.
 
 For example, for .twoColFixLtHdr 
#container, select only.twoCol
FixLtHdr (including the space) and 
delete the entire class name and space, 
leaving only #container.
 5. Repeat Step 4 for each ID style that includes 
the class name.
 
 When you delete the class name from the 
beginning of each of ID style in the CSS 
Styles panel, the page layout is restored in 
the workspace.

 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
Editing the styles in a CSS layout
After you create a new page with a CSS layout, you have a seemingly infinite 
number of options for editing it, but first you have to determine which styles 
in the style sheet correspond to the elements you want to edit.
In this example, because I’ve chosen a fixed width layout, I know a style can 
be used to change the width of the layout area. Following a common practice 
of using <div> tags to contain elements on a page and using ID styles to 
describe how they should be displayed, Dreamweaver includes a <div> tag 
with an ID style named #containerin every layout. To change the width of 
any of these designs, change the corresponding #containerstyle, as shown 
in the following exercise.
The steps in the following sections explain how to edit the overall design of a 
page created with a Dreamweaver CSS layout. I’ve broken the process into 
several step lists to help you following along more easily. Note: The steps 
assume you’re proceeding through the sections in order.
As you can probably imagine, there are many ways you can edit the styles in 
a CSS layout to create your own designs, and the process I explain in the fol-
lowing sections is just one them. I help you understand what you need to do 
to get started. After you set your basic page design, you can create as many 
additional styles as you desire. In the section “Styling an Unordered List for 
Links,” for example, you find instructions for creating a series of styles to 
format a list of links with the <ul> and <li> tags to create a horizontal navi-
gation bar with a simple rollover effect.
Getting started
To begin editing styles in a CSS layout, follow these steps:
 
1. With the file open, choose Window➪CSS Styles or click the CSS Styles 
button to expand the panel.
 
 The CSS Styles panel opens or expands.
 
2. Click the plus (+) sign (or a triangle on a Mac) next to the style sheet 
name to open the list of styles.
 
 All the styles associated with the new page are listed.
 
 To change any element in the design of this page, edit the corresponding 
style.
 
3. Select the name of any style listed in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The corresponding CSS rules defined for the style are displayed in the 
Properties pane at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel, as shown in 

174
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Figure 6-4. Clicking through the list of styles and reviewing their corre-
sponding rules is a good way to get a quick overview of the design and 
to see where the various page formatting options are stored.
 
 All the styles that include a # sign are ID styles, which correspond to 
<div> tags in the page code. These styles control the size and position-
ing of the main areas of the page and are named to correspond. For 
example, .twoColFixLtHdr #header controls the area at the top of 
the page design where you see the word Header. Similarly, #sidebar1 
controls the area with the headline Sidebar1 Content.
 
Figure 6-4: 
You can 
alter any of 
the styles in 
a CSS layout 
by editing its 
style defini-
tion in the 
CSS Styles 
panel.
 
Editing page-wide settings
To edit page-wide settings, such as the font face, size, and color of the text 
used throughout the page, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the body style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
 
2. Select the Type category and specify your desired Font settings.
 
3. Select the Background category and use the color well in the 
Background-Color field to specify a color for the entire background of 
the page.
 
 Alternatively, you can enter any hexadecimal color code manually in the 
Background-Color field.
 
4. Click the Apply button to preview your changes and then click OK to 
save the changes and close the dialog box.

175
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
Customizing the Header area
To edit the Header area at the top of the page, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the .twoColFixLtHdr #header style in the CSS Styles panel, 
as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
 In the Properties pane, you can see that the #header style includes a 
definition for a background color, which is set to #DDDDDD (the hexadec-
imal code for the gray color displayed in the top of the page design 
where the word Header appears).
 
 All the CSS layouts in Dreamweaver are identified by a class style, such 
as .twoColFixLtHdr used in the layout shown in this example. 
Dreamweaver uses these class names to distinguish between the lay-
outs, but they aren’t necessary. If you prefer to simplify the ID styles 
names in your layout, you can remove the class name by following the 
instructions in the sidebar, “Removing class styles from CSS layouts.”
 
2. Click and drag to select the background color code and press the 
Delete key.
 
 Removing the color code from the Background-Color field in the 
.twoColFixLtHdr #header style removes the background color from 
the Header area completely and returns that part of the page to the 
default color, which is white (unless it’s been set to another color in 
another style).
 
3. To change the background color, double-click the.twoColFixLtHdr 
#header style to open the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the 
Background category, and then use the color well in the Background-
Color field to select another color.
 
4. Click and drag to select the word Header in the top part of the page in 
the workspace and press the Delete key.
 
 The word Header disappears.
 
5. To add your own text to the Header area, type the text as you would 
anywhere else on a Web page.
  
6. To add a graphic to the Header area, make sure your cursor is in the 
Header area, choose Insert➪Image, and select the name of image you 
want to insert.
 
 The image appears in the Header area.
 
7. Remove any unwanted spacing.
 
 The Header area of this (and nearly all the) CSS layouts in Dreamweaver 
includes extra space created by an <h1> tag and padding in the 
#header style. If you replace Header with text, you may want to main-
tain these spacing features, but if you add an image, as I have in this 
example, you probably want to get rid of this extra space. Here’s how:

176
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
a. Click to select the .twoColFixLtHdr #header style in the CSS 
Styles panel.
 
b. Click and drag to select the contents of the Padding field. In this 
example, select “0 10px 0 20px” in the Padding field in the 
Properties pane at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel and then 
press the Delete or Backspace key.
 
 This completely removes all the padding from the Header area.
 
c. Select the text or image you inserted into the Header area and 
then right-click the <h1> tag in the tag selector at the bottom of 
the workspace and choose Remove Tag from the pop-up menu, 
as shown in Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
You can 
use the tag 
selector 
at the bot-
tom of the 
workspace 
to edit or 
remove tags 
and styles.
 
Customizing the content areas
You may also want to adjust the width and padding of the content areas in 
your preset layout. When you’re done, you’re ready to add your own text to 
these areas. The following steps explain how:
 
1. To change the width of the entire content area, select the .two
ColFixLtHdr #container style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The style definition appears in the Properties pane (refer to Figure 6-5).
 
2. Select the size in the width field and type a new number with your 
desired page width.
 
 In this example, I selected the width, which is set to 780, as shown in 
Figure 6-5, and I changed it to 760. When you alter the width of the 
#content style, as I did here, you change the width of the entire design 
because all the other <div> tags are contained within the <div> that’s 
formatted with the #content style and they’re all set to expand to fill 
the #content <div>.

177
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
3. Replace the text in the sidebar and main content areas.
 
 You can replace the text in any page created from a CSS layout just as 
you would in any other Web page. If you delete content, such as the 
headline in the sidebar, make sure you also delete any corresponding 
code, such as the <h3> tag, which formats the sidebar heading. You 
can most easily delete this code by using the tag selector, as shown in 
Figure 6-5.
 
4. To change the width and background color of the sidebar, double-
click the .twoColFixLtHdr #sidebar1 style in the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
 
5. Select the Background category and use the color well in the 
Background-Color field to specify a color.
 
 Alternatively, you can enter any hexadecimal color code manually.
 
6. Select the Box category and change the width, padding, and margin 
settings.
 
 You can alter the width of the sidebar, the padding (the space inside the 
border of the sidebar), or the margins (the space outside the border of 
the sidebar).
 
7. Click the Apply button to preview the changes and then click OK to 
save the changes and close the dialog box.
 
 The changes are applied automatically to the design in the open page.
 
 When you change the width of a sidebar in a Dreamweaver CSS layout, you 
must also change the corresponding margin setting in the mainContent 
style (as you see in the next step). The width in the sidebar style and the 
margin in the mainContent style are used in combination to control the 
positioning of the sidebar and mainContent <div>s in relation to each 
other.
 
8. Double-click the .twoColFixLtHdr #mainContent style in the CSS 
Styles panel.
 
 The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
 
9. Select the Box category and change the margin settings to correspond 
to the new width of the sidebar.
 
 In this example, I changed the width of the sidebar from 200 to 300, so I 
need to change the corresponding margin setting in the mainContent 
style. You may not want to change the margin setting by the same 
amount as you changed the width of the sidebar because this can lead 
to a margin that may not look right in your page design. Instead, I recom-
mend you experiment by changing the margin setting and then clicking 
the Apply button to see how the page looks.

178
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
10. Choose File➪Save to save the page and styles.
 
 If you saved the styles in an external style sheet, you’re prompted by a 
second dialog box to save the style sheet separately. If the styles are 
contained in an internal style sheet, they’re saved automatically when 
you save the page.
 
After you edit a CSS layout to create the page design you want to use in your 
site, it’s good practice to save the page as a template so that you can create 
additional pages with the same layout, without repeating all these steps to 
customize the styles. As you discover in Chapter 9, there are many advantages 
to using Dreamweaver’s template features when you’re designing a site with 
more than a few pages.
Here’s a related tip: If you’ll use the design as a template, make sure you save 
your styles in an external style sheet so that the style rules can be edited out-
side the template. Find instructions for creating external style sheets and for 
moving internal styles into an external style sheet in Chapter 5.
Turning Styles On and Off in Firefox
Even if you prefer another Web browser, I strongly encourage you to down-
load and install the Firefox browser for testing your Web pages. Firefox is 
made for both Mac and PC computers and you can download it for free from 
www.mozilla.com/firefox.
Not only is it good practice to test your pages in more than one browser (at 
the very least, Internet Explorer and Firefox), the Firefox browser offers sev-
eral special features and extensions that can help you better view your CSS 
and the CSS on other people’s Web sites.
As shown in Figures 6-6 and 6-7, you can turn the styles that format a Web 
page on and off in Firefox. To turn off styles, choose View➪Page Style➪No 
Style. To turn on styles, choose View➪Page Style➪Basic Page Style. If the 
page includes additional style sheets, such as style sheets that increase the 
font size of a page to make it more accessible, you can select those styles 
instead.
 
The Web Developer Add On for Firefox adds many great features to the 
browser, including the ability to view an external style sheet on any Web site 
(that’s right, you can look under the hood of other people’s Web sites with 
this add-on). You can even view CSS style sheets by Media type so that you 
can see how a site, such as Disney.com, develops different style sheets for 
print, screen, and handheld devices. To find this valuable addition to Firefox, 
click the Add-Ons link at the top of the Firefox Web page and then search for 
Web Developer. The Add-Ons link, which is consistently rated with five out of 
five stars, is free, and takes only a few seconds to download and install.

179
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
Styling an Unordered List for Links
Here’s a great CSS trick for turning a bulleted list into a navigation bar with 
a simple rollover effect. Using a bulleted list for navigation bars is a well-
accepted convention for Web sites that meet current accessibility standards. 
A bulleted list is a logical choice for navigation elements because even if the 
style rules are removed, the links still stand out from the rest of the elements 
on the page and are clearly grouped together.
In Figures 6-6 and 6-7, you see the same Web page displayed in Firefox with 
the styles turned on and off. Notice that the navigation links are formatted in 
a simple, bulleted list when the styles are turned off but are displayed in a 
horizontal row with no bullets when styles are turned on.
Thanks to CSS, you can gain the benefits of styling a list of links with the 
unordered list tag and still format your links with any style you choose so 
that you don’t have to keep those boring bullets and can align your links 
horizontally or vertically. Using CSS instead of images to create a rollover 
effect like the one featured in the following exercise not only makes your 
page more accessible, but it helps your page load faster, too.
 
Figure 6-6: 
You can 
view the 
same Web 
page with 
styles 
turned on 
or off in 
the Firefox 
browser. In 
this image, 
the styles 
are turned 
on.

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Figure 6-7: 
This is the 
same page 
shown in 
Figure 6-6, 
but the 
styles are 
turned off.
 
 
This exercise builds on the page design created in the earlier sections in this 
chapter, except that I’ve removed the class styles that were included at the 
beginning of each of the ID styles. This makes it simpler to create new styles 
within the <div> tags that are formatted by the ID styles. You find instruc-
tions for altering the styles in a CSS layout like this in the sidebar, “Removing 
class styles from CSS layouts” earlier in this chapter.
To create a navigation bar using CSS to redefine the unordered list and link 
tags, follow these steps:
 
1. Place your cursor in the HTML page where you want your navigation 
bar to appear and then click the Div button in the Common Insert 
panel to insert a <div> tag.
 
 The Insert Div Tag dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
 When you’re creating a list of links to serve as your navigation bar, it’s 
best to store those links in a <div> tag at the top or side of the page 
where visitors to your site can easily find them.
 
2. Specify an Insert option.
 
 You can choose from a variety of options in the Insert drop-down list to 
more precisely control where the new <div> tag is added. If you’re not 
sure, you can leave the Wrap around Selection option selected, even if 
you haven’t selected anything.

181
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
Figure 6-8:

Div Tag 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Enter a name in the Class field or the ID field.
 
 You can name the <div> tag anything you like as long as you don’t use 
spaces or special characters (underscores and hyphens are okay). In 
this example, I chose to create an ID style, so I entered navbar in the ID 
field. (Remember: ID styles are generally recommended for positioning 
<div> tags that make up part of the layout of a Web page.)
 
4. Click the New CSS Rule button to create a new style for your Div ID as 
you insert the <div> tag.
 
 The New CSS Rule dialog box opens.
 
5. Select the Box category and specify the desired settings for the size, 
margins, and padding.
 
 For the navbar shown in this example, I set the margins to 0, set the 
padding to 2 pixels, checked the All box to apply the same padding to all 
sides, and left the Height and Width fields blank, which means the 
<div> tag will expand to fit its contents and its container.
 
6. Select the Background category and choose a background color or 
image.
 
 If you don’t specify a color or insert a background image, the color of 
the navbar <div> tag will be determined by the color of any <div> tag 
that contains it or by the specified page color. In this example, I’ve 
selected a lavender color to set the navbar apart from the rest of the 
design.
 
7. Select the Type category and specify the font options.
 
 If you don’t specify any font settings, the text will be displayed in the 
font set for the page or the surrounding container.
 
 In this example, I’ve set the font to Verdana in the <body> tag, and 
because I don’t want to change it, I left the Font-Family field blank. I do, 
however, want the text to display a little smaller in the navbar than it 
does in the rest of the page, so I’ve set the Font-Size to 90 percent, which 
will display the text in this <div> tag at 90 percent of the default text 
size for the page.

182
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
8. Click OK to close the New CSS Rule dialog box and then click OK to 
close the Insert Div Tag dialog box.
 
 The new <div> tag is added to the page and the #navbar ID style is cre-
ated and listed in the CSS Styles panel. Content for id “navbar” 
goes here is inserted between the open <div> tag and the close 
</div> tag to make it easy to identify where you should add your own 
content within the <div> tag. Make sure to delete this text when you 
add your own content.
 
9. Insert the text for each link into the navbar <div> area.
 
 Make sure to separate each line of text with a Return (so that the text is 
formatted with a <p> tag in the code). If the lines aren’t separated by para-
graph tags, the unordered list won’t be applied properly in the next step.
 
10. To format the text as an unordered list, click and drag to select all the 
text in the navbar <div> and then click the Unordered List icon in 
the Property inspector.
 
 If you haven’t redefined the unordered list tag already, the text changes 
to the default settings of an unordered list, removing the space between 
each line and adding bullets.
 
11. Set links from each text section just as you would link any other text 
block or image.
 
 
 You find detailed instructions for setting links in Chapter 2, but the 
simplest way is to first select the text and then click the Link icon in the 
Common Insert panel. In the Hyperlink dialog box, enter the URL you 
want the text to link to or use the Browse button (which looks like a 
folder) to the right of the link field to locate the file you want to link to.
 
 If you haven’t yet created the pages you’ll link to, you can set a tempo-
rary link by entering a pound (#) sign in the Link field. This is important 
because in order for the styles that you create in the rest of this exercise 
to work, the text must be linked to something so that the link styles 
will apply.
 
12. Create a new style to redefine the unordered list tag when it’s dis-
played in the <div> tag with the #navbar ID by following these steps 
to create styles with the compound selector:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Selector Name field, enter #navbar ul, as shown in 
Figure 6-9, and then click OK.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, choose the Box category 
and set margins and padding to 0. 
 
e. Select the Same for All check box for both margins and padding 
to remove the margins and padding included in the <ul> 
HTML tag.

f. Click OK to save the style and close the dialog box.
 
 The spacing around the list of links formatted as an Unordered List 
disappears.
 
13. Create a new compound style to redefine the list item tag by following 
these steps:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Selector Name field, enter #navbar ul li (make sure to 
include spaces between each name) and then click OK.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the Block category 
and set Display to Inline.
 
 This changes the style of the <li> tag from vertical to horizontal.
 
e. Select the List category and set Type to None to remove the 
bullet.
 
f. Select the Box category and set margins left and right to 40 
pixels.
 
 This separates the list items from one another in the horizontal 
list. You can change the setting to any measurement to create the 
amount of space between links that best fits your design.
 
g. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.

c. In the Tag field, enter #navbar a:link and then click OK.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the Type category 
and set Decoration to None by clicking the check box.
 
 This removes the underline from linked text.
 
e. Still in the Type category, change the text color to the color you 
want your links to appear when they’re first loaded on a page.
 
 I set the text color to a dark blue.
 
f. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.
 
15. Create a new style to redefine the hover link tag so that the link color 
will change when a user rolls a cursor over the link:
  
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Tag field, enter #navbar a:hover and then click OK.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, select the Type category 
and set Decoration to None by clicking the check box.
 
 This removes the underline from linked text. If you prefer to have 
the underline appear when a user rolls a cursor over a link, check 
Underline.
 
e. Still in the Type category, change the text color to the color you 
want your links to appear when users roll their cursors over the 
link.
 
 I set the text color to a bright red color. The more dramatic the 
color difference between the a:link and a:hover colors, the 
more dramatic the rollover effect.
 
f. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.
 
16. Create a new style to redefine the visited link tag so that the link color 
will change after a user clicks a link:
 
a. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪New.
 
b. Under Selector Type, choose Compound.
 
c. In the Tag field, enter #navbar a:visited and then click OK.
 
d. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, choose the Type category 
and set Decoration to None by clicking the check box.
 
e. Still in the Type category, change the text color to the color you 
want your links to appear after the link has been visited.
 
 I set the text color to a light gray color. If you want the color to 
remain the same, set the a:visited link to the same color as the 
a:link.
 
f. Click OK to save these settings and close the dialog box.

Preview button to view the page in a browser to see the effect of the 
link styles.
Using CSS to Create Custom 
Page Layouts
This section is designed to help you better understand how Dreamweaver 
creates CSS layouts and introduces you to how to create your own custom 
CSS layouts. For starters, you explore the box model workflow, which forms 
the foundation of any CSS layout. You also discover some basics about 
margins versus padding and how CSS displays in different browsers.
Creating designs using the box model
The key to understanding the way CSS works when it comes to page layout is 
to think in terms of designing with a series of infinitely adjustable containers, 
or boxes. The entire process is often referred to as the box model. Think of 
the box model this way:
 
1. Create <div> tags that span the full width of the page and stack one 
on top of another.
Creating compound styles
When you redefine tags, such as the unordered 
list and link tags, the new style applies to all 
uses of that tag within a page unless you define 
the tags as compound styles by including 
the name of their container as part of the 
style name.
For example, in the exercise in the “Styling an 
Unordered List for Links” section, instead of 
creating a new tag style with just the name of 
the <ul> tag, I created a new tag style called 
#navbar ul to redefine the <ul> tag 
only when it’s contained within a <div> tag 
with an ID of navbar.
When you create advanced styles like this, use 
the name of the container followed by the tag 
name separated by a single space. In this 
example, I also created styles for the <li> and 
<link> tags in the same way, creating styles 
with names like #navbar 
a:link, 
#navbar a:hover, and #navbar ul 
li. You can create compound styles with 
multiple tags or styles to create more specific 
CSS rules, but you must include a space 
between each tag or style name.

186
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Although you can use any HTML element for page layout, the <div> tag 
is used most often to create page layouts with CSS. <div> stands for 
division. Think of the <div> tag as simply a container to hold other con-
tent or to make a division on the page, separating one section of content 
from another. Unlike other HTML tags, the <div> tag has no inherent 
formatting features except to add a line break. Unless CSS is applied to 
a <div> tag, it can seem invisible on a page. And yet it has a powerful 
purpose because any content surrounded by an opening <div> tag and 
closing <div> tag becomes an object (or a box) that can be formatted 
with CSS.
 
2. Add content, such as text and images, into each box.
 
 Alternatively, you can create the CSS styles to position the boxes and 
then add content, but I find it easier to decide how to define the styles 
after I see at least some of the content in place.
 
3. Tag content as needed, with the <ul> tag or <p> (paragraph) tag to 
contain your content.
 
4. With the content and boxes in place, create the styles that position 
each box to create the design you want for the page.
 
 Most often, you assign each <div> tag an ID and then create an ID style 
to control how each container appears on the page. You give each ID 
style attributes to control the position, alignment, and other formatting 
options of each box and its contents. You can also specify such settings 
as margins, padding, and borders to add space and outlines around 
these containers.
Comparing block and inline elements
As a general rule, HTML tags can be divided 
into block elements and inline elements. Block 
elements, such as the <div> tag, interrupt the 
flow of the page, creating a box or block around 
which other page elements align. In HTML, 
block elements include the paragraph (<p>) 
tag, which creates a line break before and after 
it’s used and doesn’t allow anything to appear 
alongside it. Heading tags, such as <h1>, 
<h2>, and <h3>, and list tags, such as <ul> 
and <ol>, are also block elements.
In contrast, inline elements flow with text. For 
example, the <strong> and <em> tags are 
inline elements. You can place these elements 
one after another, and a new line break doesn’t 
appear between each element. They simply 
flow with the text. For that reason, the <span> 
tag, which is an inline element, is a good choice 
for applying styles that you want to affect a 
small amount of text within a block, such as 
when you want to add a little color to text con-
tained within <p> tags.

187
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
ID style names always begin with a # sign and must match the corresponding 
ID assigned to the block element, in this case <div> tags in the HTML code. 
For a quick reference to style selectors and their corresponding HTML code, 
see the sidebar, “CSS options at a glance.” For a more detailed explanation of 
CSS selectors, see Chapter 5.
Comparing margins and padding
When it comes to design, one of the more confusing aspects of the box model 
is the way margins and padding work:
 
 Padding adds space inside an element. Think of padding as a way to add 
a cushion around the inside of a box so that your content doesn’t bump 
into the sides of your box.
 
 Margins add space outside an element. Think of margins as a way to add 
space between boxes and other elements on a page, such as text and 
images, so that they don’t bump into each other.
In Figure 6-10, you see a <div> tag with a corresponding ID style that creates 
the thin black border around the <div> tag, which defines it as follows:
500 pixels wide
25 pixels of padding inside the <div> tag border
50 pixels of margin spacing outside the <div> tag border
 
Figure 6-10: 
Padding is 
added to 
the inside of 
an element, 
and margins 
are added to 
the outside.
 
Here’s the confusing part:
 
 Padding adds to the specified width. If you specify a width for a <div> 
tag (or any other box element), as I have in Figure 6-10, the total width is 
increased by the padding. In my example, the <div> tag will fill 550 
pixels of space on the page: 500 pixels for the width plus 25 pixels on 
each side of padding.

188
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Margins add to the total space taken up by an element in a page. The 
margins of the <div> tag style are set to 50 pixels, so the <div> tag is 
positioned 50 pixels from the top and left of the page and no other ele-
ment will display closer than 50 pixels on the right or bottom. This pre-
vents the display of any other element in that space and it means that 
the <div> tag effectively takes up all of that space on the page.
 
 Borders add to the specified width, too. The ID style for the <div> tag 
also includes border settings, which cause the dark border to surround 
the <div> tag. The thin border adds another 2 pixels to each side of the 
<div> tag (4 pixels total).
Thus, the total space on the page that will be filled by the <div> tag is 
654 pixels:
500 pixel width
50 pixels total of padding
4 pixels of border
100 pixels for the 50 pixel margin on each side
 
As you see in the exercise that follows, understanding how styles affect the 
width of elements is especially important when you want to place two or more 
containers side by side, such as the three photos contained within <div> tags 
in the page design shown in Figure 6-11.
 
Figure 6-11: 
This page 
design was 
created 
using the 
CSS box 
model.
 

189
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
Note that in the example shown in Figure 6-11, I’ve set the margins for the 
entire page to 0. This is an easy setting to make in the Page Properties dialog 
box, available by clicking the Page Properties button in the Property inspector 
or by choosing Modify➪Page Properties.
When you alter the margin settings in the Page Properties dialog box, 
Dreamweaver automatically creates a new tag style by redefining the <body> 
tag. Setting page margins to 0 means that any content on the page will be 
aligned from the very top and left edges of the browser window when the 
page is displayed in a Web browser. If you don’t change the page margins, 
most Web browsers will display the contents of a Web page 10 pixels from 
the top and left edges of the browser window.
Displaying CSS in different browsers
Neither Dreamweaver nor I can show you exactly how your Web pages will 
look to everyone who may ever view them on the Web because different 
browsers display Web pages differently, especially older browser versions 
that don’t include standards-compliant support for CSS (and many other 
advanced Web design features, for that matter).
If you want your Web pages to look exactly the same in every browser 
that might ever visit your pages, you have to create very simple designs that 
don’t use any of the latest Web design features. If you want to create more 
advanced page designs and want your pages to look exactly the same in all 
the most recent browser versions (including Internet Explorer versions 5 
and up), you’ll have to move on to more advanced CSS training when you’re 
finished with this book and explore the “hacks” that have been developed 
to get around browser differences. You’ll find many books, Web sites, and 
training videos dedicated to advanced CSS training.
 
For a list of more advanced CSS training resources online and off, visit 
www.DigitalFamily.com/dreamweaver and look for the article on “Where 
to learn advanced CSS tips and tricks.”
For the purposes of this book, I’ve designed pages that are consistent in their 
display on IE 6 and later, Firefox 1.5 and later, and Safari and Firefox on the 
Mac. I can’t cover all the CSS hacks needed to design CSS layouts for every 
browser in use on the Web today, but the browsers that I targeted with 
these designs represent the majority of Web browsers your visitors are likely 
to use.
 
One of the advantages of using the predesigned CSS layouts in Dreamweaver 
is that they’re designed with browser differences in mind and, unless you edit 
them heavily, should display well in the vast majority of Web browsers. When 
you create custom CSS designs, like the one covered in the next section, 
“Creating a Custom CSS Layout,” keep in mind that you run the risk of creating 
designs that can look quite different from one browser to another.

190
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
I leave it to you to decide whether to worry about visitors with older brows-
ers and whether to explore more advanced CSS training when you’re finished 
here. At the very least, this is why I always recommend that you test your 
page designs in a variety of Web browsers, and on both Macs and PCs, 
whenever possible. With a little trial and error, you can often find ways to 
create even complex designs that look good across many different systems.
Creating a Custom CSS Layout
There are many approaches to creating layouts with CSS. You can create 
fluid layouts that expand and contract to fill the browser window no matter 
how wide or narrow, and you can create fixed layouts that remain a specified 
width no matter how wide the browser window. When you create fixed-width 
designs, such as the example in this section, it’s good practice to center the 
design on the Web page so that it appears to float in the middle of the page 
no matter what the size of the browser window.
 
The following exercise walks you through the creation of the design shown in 
Figure 6-11 using a series of <div> tags created within a <div> tag with an ID 
named #container. The corresponding container style defines the container 
with a fixed width of 760 pixels. As you see in Step 4 in the later section 
“Styling the container <div> tag,” the trick to centering a <div> tag with a 
style is to set the left and right margins to Auto. This makes the browser dis-
play an equal amount of margin space on each side of the container and effec-
tively centers the <div> tag and all its content in the page. This is an 
important trick because <div> tags and other block-level elements have no 
center option.
Splitting the view
If you’re creating a series of <div> tags to 
position content on a Web page, you may find it 
easier to keep track of the <div> tags if you 
use Dreamweaver’s split view, which enables 
you to see the code view and design view simul-
taneously. To split the workspace area, choose 
View➪Code and Design or click the Split view 
button, located just under the Insert panel at the 
top of the workspace.
If you select an image, text, or another element 
on a page in design view, it’s automatically 
highlighted in code view, a great feature that 
makes it easier to find your place in the code 
when you’re trying to troubleshoot what’s hap-
pening behind the scenes.
I like to use split view to keep an eye on the 
code as I create page designs, especially when 
I’m inserting <div> tags, because it can be 
hard to keep track of how <div> tags are 
arranged and nested when you’re using only 
design view.

191
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
Work through the following sections in order to create a fixed-width, three-
column layout with a header and footer area using CSS and <div> tags. I’ve 
broken the key tasks into individual sections.
Setting up the page and the boxes
 
1. Choose File➪New and then choose Blank Page from the left column, 
HTML from the Page Type options in the middle, and <none> from the 
Layout section.
 
 Alternatively, you can use one of the predesigned CSS layouts listed 
under the Layout section covered in “Using CSS Layouts in 
Dreamweaver” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Save the page in the root folder of the Web site.
 
 It’s important to save all the pages of a Web site in the root folder. You 
find more about defining a Web site and specifying a root folder in 
Dreamweaver in Chapter 2.
 
3. Choose Modify➪Page Properties and specify the page-wide options.
 
 The Page Properties dialog opens.
 
 For this example, I set the page margins to 0 and the Background color 
to a dark blue color.
 
 Note that when you use the Page Properties dialog box, Dreamweaver 
creates the corresponding CSS styles for the <body> tag, saves them in 
an internal style sheet at the top of the HTML document, and displays 
the new styles in the CSS Styles panel. (You find instructions for moving 
internal styles into an external style sheet in Chapter 5.)
 
4. Click the Insert Div Tag button in the Common Insert panel, as shown 
in Figure 6-12.
 
 The Insert Div Tag dialog box opens.
 
 This is the first of a series of <div> tags you’ll add to the page, and 
these steps can get a bit tricky, but the goal is simple — to insert a 
<div> tag for each section of content that you want to appear on the 
page. For this design (shown completed in Figure 6-11) I need five <div> 
tags; one to serve as the container for the entire design, which can also 
contain the banner image at the top; one for each of the three photos I 
want to line up in the three columns; and one for the footer, where I’ll 
add my copyright information at the bottom of the page.
 
5. In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, enter the container name in the ID 
field and then click OK.
 
 A <div> tag is inserted into the page with the words: Content for id 
“container” Goes Here.

192
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Although you can create styles for your <div> tags as you create them 
by clicking the New CSS Rule button, I often find it simpler to first create 
the <div> tags and name then, add the content to the <div> tags, and 
then go back and create the styles after the content’s in place.
 
6. Make sure your cursor is inside the <div> tag you just created, press 
Enter (Return) to add a paragraph break, and then click the Insert Div 
Tag button in the Common Insert panel to add another <div> tag 
inside the first one.
 
 The Insert Div Tag dialog box opens.
 
7. In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, enter photo1 in the ID field and then 
click OK.
 
 A <div> tag is inserted into the page with the words: Content for id 
“photo1” Goes Here.
 
8. Make sure your cursor is inside the first <div> tag named container, 
and just below the second <div> tag named photo1, and click the 
Insert Div Tag button in the Common Insert panel to add another 
<div> tag.
 
9. In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, enter photo2 in the ID field and then 
click OK.
 
 A <div> tag is inserted into the page with the words: Content for id 
“photo2” Goes Here.
 
10. Make sure your cursor is inside the first <div> tag named container, 
and just below the third <div> tag named photo2, and click the 
Insert Div Tag button in the Common Insert panel to add another 
<div> tag.
 
11. In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, enter the name photo3 in the ID field 
and then click OK.
 
 A <div> tag is inserted into the page with the words: Content for id 
“photo3” Goes Here.
 
12. Make sure your cursor is inside the first <div> tag named container, 
and just below the fourth <div> tag named photo3, and click the 
Insert Div Tag button in the Common Insert panel to add another 
<div> tag.
 
13. In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, enter the name of the footer in the ID 
field and then click OK.
 
 A <div> tag is inserted into the page with the words: Content for id 
“footer” Goes Here.

193
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
 If you’ve entered all the <div> tags correctly, your page should look like 
Figure 6-12. If you have accidentally created one <div> tag inside 
another when you don’t mean to, choose Edit➪Undo, move your cursor, 
and try again. You can also use split view: Position your cursor in the 
HTML code to get it where you want it and use the Insert Div Tag button 
in the Common Insert panel. See the sidebar “Splitting the view” for tips 
on how to use this approach.
 
14. Add content to each <div> tag.
 
 You can add content to each of your <div> tags as you would add 
content anywhere else on a page. For this example, I used the Insert 
Image icon in the Common Insert panel to add the images and then I 
typed in the text for the captions and copyright information.
 
Figure 6-12: 
You can 
create a 
CSS layout 
like the 
one shown 
in Figure 
6-11 by first 
creating a 
series of 
<div> tags 
like you see 
here.
 
Styling the container <div> tag
Think of the container <div> tag as the <div> tag that contains all the 
others. The styles you set for it create the overall width of the design you 
create with all the other <div> tags and other elements you insert inside 
the container <div> tag. To set the styles for the example in this section, 
follow these steps:

194
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
1. Place your cursor at the beginning of Content the id 
“container” Goes Here.
 
2. Click the New CSS Rule icon (hint: it looks like a small piece of paper 
with a plus sign (+) over it) at the bottom of the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The New CSS Rules dialog box opens. Because your cursor was inside 
the container <div>, #container should already be entered into the 
Selector Name field. If it’s not, type it in exactly as you entered the 
name when you created the container <div>. If anything else is included 
in the Selector Name field, such as the <p> tag, delete it so that only 
#container remains.
 
3. Leave the Rule Definition drop-down list set to This Document Only 
and click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule definition for #container opens.
 
4. In the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, specify the formatting settings.
 
 As shown in Figure 6-13, for the container <div> tag in this example, I 
set the width to 780 pixels. Here’s the trick to centering a <div> tag like 
this: Set the left and right margins to Auto. That way a browser automati-
cally adds an equal amount of margin space to each side of the <div> 
tag, effectively centering it on the page.
 
5. Click the Apply button to preview the style and then click OK to close 
the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and save the style.
 
 When you create an ID style that matches the name of an ID assigned to 
a <div> tag, the style is applied immediately when you click the Apply 
button. (Make sure the ID and the style name are an exact match. If you 
add an extra space or mistype a character, this won’t work.)

Set the left 
and right 
margins to 
Auto in the

 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
Creating columns in the design
To ensure that your layout will work with three columns (at least that’s the 
number of columns in the example for this section), calculate how wide to 
define the styles for each of your photo <div>s. Yes, that means you have to 
do a little math, and yes, you’re certainly welcome to get out a calculator or 
make a sketch on scrap paper (or, as I prefer, do both). With this prep work 
out of the way, you’re ready to create styles for the columns. The following 
steps walk you through the process:
 
1. Calculate the width and positioning of the <div> tags that create the 
three columns in the design.
 
 Let me walk you through the way I’d calculate this design. First, I know 
I set the width for the #container to 780 pixels so I know that’s all the 
space I have to work with. Next, I know that each of the photos is 175 
pixels wide, so I know that I have to subtract 175 times 3 (which is 525 
pixels) from 780. That leaves me with 235 pixels to create margins 
between my three photos and the left and right side of my container. If I 
want to space them evenly, I’d then need to divide 235 by 3, but I’ve 
decided that I’d rather group the three photos in the middle of the 
design and leave more space on the right and left.
 
 So, I decide arbitrarily that I want 20 pixels of margin space between 
each of the images in the center area of the page and then I split up the 
remaining space on each side of the group of three photos. That means I 
need to subtract 40 pixels from 235, which leaves me with 195 pixels to 
split between the two sides. Because you can’t use fractions of pixels, I 
put 98 pixels on the left and leave 97 pixels on the right.
 
 With the calculations complete, you’re ready to define the styles for the 
three columns by creating ID styles for each of the photo <div>s. In 
addition to setting the width, padding, and margins for each style, I also 
used the Float option to align the <div>s to the left so that they align 
next to each other.
 
2. Place your cursor inside the <div> you named photo1 and then click 
the New CSS Rule icon (the one with the plus sign [+] over it) at the 
bottom of the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The New CSS Rules dialog box opens. Because your cursor was inside 
the photo1 <div> tag, #photo1 should already be entered into the 
Selector Name field. If it’s not, type it exactly as you entered the name 
when you created the <div> tag.
 
 If one <div> tag is contained within another, as you see in this case 
where the #photo1 <div> tag is inside the #container <div> tag, 
then both names appear automatically in the Selector Name field. In this 
case, you have the option of deleting the name of the first div to create 
a simple ID style, or keeping both names to create a compound style 
which will only work if the styles are used together.

196
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
3. Leave the Rule Definition drop-down list set to This Document Only 
and click OK
 
 The CSS Rule definition for #photo1 opens.
 
4. Click to select the Box category and specify Width, Float, and Margin 
settings, as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
 For the photo1 <div> tag in this example, I set the width to 175 pixels, 
exactly the size of the photo. Next, choose Left from the Float drop-
down list to align the <div> tag to the left side of the page. Now here’s 
the tricky part, I want this <div> tag to be 98 pixels from the left side of 
my container, so I want to set the Left margin to 98 pixels. Finally, I set 
the Top, Right, and Bottom margins to 10. (I’ll set the inside margins of 
the other two photos to 10 pixels to achieve a 20-pixel wide margin 
between them.)
 
Figure 6-14:

settings 
to define 
the Width,

5. Click the Apply button to preview the style click OK to close the CSS 
Rule Definition dialog box and save the style.
 
 The style is applied automatically, and the first photo aligns to the left, 
98 pixels from the left side of the page.
 
6. Place your cursor inside the <div> tag you named photo2 and then 
click the New CSS Rule icon (the one with the plus sign [+] over it) at 
the bottom of the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The New CSS Rules dialog box opens. Because your cursor was inside 
the photo2 <div> tag, #photo2 should already be entered into the 
Selector Name field. If it’s not, type it exactly as you entered the name 
when you created the <div> tag.

7. Leave the Rule Definition drop-down list set to This Document Only 
and click OK
 
 The CSS Rule definition for #photo2 opens.
 
8. Click to select the Box category and specify Width, Float, and Margin 
settings.
 
 For the photo2 <div> tag in this example, I set the width to 175 pixels, 
exactly the size of the photo. Next, choose Left from the Float drop-
down list to align the <div> tag to the left side of the page so it will float 
up next to the first photo. And finally, select the Same for All box under 
Margin and enter 10 in the Top field. A 10 automatically appears in all 
four margin fields because Same for All is selected.
 
9. Click the Apply button to preview the style and then click OK to close 
the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and save the style.
 
 The style is applied automatically, and the second photo aligns to the 
left, 20 pixels from the first photo.
 
10. Place your cursor inside the <div> tag you named photo3 and then 
click the New CSS Rule icon (the one with the plus sign [+] over it) at 
the bottom of the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The New CSS Rules dialog box opens. Because your cursor was inside 
the photo3 <div> tag, #photo3 should already be entered into the 
Selector Name field. If it’s not, type it exactly as you entered the name 
when you created the <div> tag.
 
11. Leave the Rule Definition drop-down list set to This Document Only 
and click OK
 
 The CSS Rule definition for #photo3 opens.
 
12. Click to select the Box category and specify Width, Float, and Margin 
settings.
 
 For the photo3 <div> tag in this example, I set the width to 175 pixels, 
exactly the size of the photo. Next, choose Left from the Float drop-
down list to align the <div> tag to the left side of the page so it will float 
up next to the second photo. And finally, enter 10 pixels in the Top, 
Bottom, and Left Margin fields.
 
 Leave the Right Margin field blank for photo3. Because it’s aligned to 
the left, you don’t need to specify the margin space on the right, and 
leaving this blank allows for greater flexibility if the page is viewed in an 
older browser version (some older browsers display margins differently; 
leaving this blank can prevent the third photo from wrapping down 
below the first two in older browsers).

198

13. Click the Apply button to preview the style and then click OK to close 
the CSS Rule Definition dialog box and save the style.
 
 The style is applied automatically, and the third photo aligns to the left, 
floating up to position 20 pixels from the second photo.
Wrapping up the custom layout
The last phase in creating the custom CSS layout example in this section 
is to style the footer and then make any additional changes you want to 
the design.
To create a style for the footer, in this example, use the Clear option to keep 
the footer positioned at the bottom of the page layout. If you’re creating a 
multi-column design like the one in this example, and you use the Float 
option to align the columns to the left or right, you run the risk that the 
footer <div> tag at the bottom of the design will be displayed on top of or 
beside the columns instead of below them.
The reasons for this get complicated, but it has to do with how box elements 
change when you use the Float setting and take them out of the flow of 
the page. Because column heights can vary due to text size, differences in 
different browsers, and computer platforms, it’s almost impossible to create 
columns of text on a Web page that will always be displayed with the same 
height. As a result, it’s good practice to use the Clear option to ensure that 
the footer remains at the bottom of the design no matter what. Using the 
Clear option also ensures that the container will surround all the content on 
the page when it’s displayed in a browser.
Follow these steps to create a style for the footer <div> tag:
 
1. Place your cursor inside the footer <div> tag and then click the New 
CSS Rule icon (the one with the plus sign [+] over it) at the bottom of 
the CSS Styles panel.
 
 The New CSS Rules dialog box opens. Because your cursor was inside 
the footer <div>, #footer should already be entered into the Selector 
Name field. If it’s not, type it exactly as you entered the name when you 
created the <div> tag.
 
2. Leave the Rule Definition drop-down list set to This Document Only. 
and click OK.
 
 The CSS Rule definition for #footer opens.
 
3. Click to select the Box category and specify the Padding and Clear 
settings.

199
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
 First, set the Padding to 10 with the Same for All button selected to add 
a little space around the copyright text in the footer.
 
 Next, choose Both from the Clear drop-down list. This forces the footer 
to clear all the columns above it and ensures that the footer appears at 
the very bottom below all the content of the page. 
After you style the footer, you can still add any other styles you want to 
format the text, images, and other elements in the design. To achieve the 
final design you see in Figure 6-11, I created styles to alter the text formatting 
of the captions as well as the copyright text in the footer. Using styles cre-
ated with a class selector works well for this kind of formatting, which you 
can find more about in Chapter 5.
Positioning Elements with AP Divs
AP Divs, or layers in Dreamweaver 8, permit precise positioning of elements 
on an HTML page. Think of an AP Div as a container for other elements, 
such as images, text, tables, and even other layers. You can put this 
container anywhere on an HTML page and even stack these containers on 
top of each other.
With AP Divs, you can position text blocks and images exactly where you 
want them on a page by specifying the distance of the AP Div from the top 
and left sides of a page or from any other container, such as another <div> 
tag. With AP Divs, you can also layer, or stack, elements on top of each other 
by changing the Z Index setting.
Because an AP Div is a container, you can manipulate everything in it as a 
unit. For example, you can move one AP Div so that it overlaps another. You 
can even make AP Divs invisible and use JavaScript or another scripting lan-
guage to change visibility dynamically.
Creating AP Divs
To create an AP Div, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪AP Div.
 
 
 A box representing an empty AP Div appears at the top of the page, 
outlined in blue. Alternatively, you can click the Draw AP Div button in 
the Layout Insert panel and then click and drag to create a new AP Div 
anywhere in the work area.

200
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. To reposition an AP Div on the page, click anywhere along the outline 
of the AP Div to select it and then drag it to the desired location.
 
 When you hold the mouse over the outline of the AP Div, the cursor 
turns to a four-pointed arrow (or a hand on the Macintosh). You also see 
eight tiny, square handles around the perimeter of the box.
 
3. Click and drag any handle to resize the AP Div.
 
4. To add content to an AP Div, insert your cursor inside the AP Div.
 
 A blinking cursor appears inside the AP Div box.
 
5. Choose Insert➪Image.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
 
6. Click the filename of the image you want to insert and then click OK.
 
 The Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens.
 
7. Fill in the Alternate Text and Long description fields and then click OK.
 
 The image is inserted into the AP Div.
 
8. Enter any text you want in the AP Div by typing or using copy and 
paste as you would to add text anywhere else on a Web page.
 
 AP Divs can be problematic when you’re working with text because text 
size can change in Web pages when displayed on different computer 
platforms, and users can change the text size in their browsers. If you’ve 
created AP Divs that are sized to fit tightly around the text in the size it 
appears on your computer, the layout can change dramatically when the 
page is displayed on another computer. For example, if the text size is 
larger, the text can get cut off or overlap other elements on the page. 
The best way to avoid this problem is to leave the height unspecified. 
This enables the AP Div to adjust to fit the content so that nothing is 
positioned under the AP Div in the layout and thus nothing is likely to 
get hidden if the text overlaps the AP Div.
 
9. To change AP Div settings in the Property inspector, click the little tab 
(which appears in the upper-left area of the AP Div when it’s selected).
 
 The Property inspector displays the AP Div settings, including its coor-
dinates in relation to the left and top of a browser window when the AP 
Div is selected: L (for left), T (for top).
 
 As shown in Figure 6-15, the AP Div in this example is exactly 300 pixels 
from the left side of the browser window and 175 pixels from the top. In 
addition to using the click-and-drag method to move a layer, you can 
change a layer’s position by entering numbers in the position boxes: L 
(number of pixels from the left edge of the page) and T (number of 
pixels from the top of the page). You can also change the height and 
width of an AP Div by entering a size in the width (W) and in the height 
(H) fields in the Property inspector.

201
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
Figure 6-15: 
Change the 
height and 
width of an 
AP Div in 
the Property 
inspector.
 
 
10. Name your AP Div by typing a name in the AP Div ID text box in the 
upper-left corner of the Property inspector.
 
 When you create a new AP Div, Dreamweaver automatically names your 
AP Div for you, starting with apDiv1, apDiv2, and so on. I find it easier 
to keep track of AP Divs when I change the name to something more 
descriptive, especially if I’m working with lots of AP Divs on a page.
 
You must select the AP Div in the main work area first for its properties to 
appear in the Property inspector, where you can rename the AP Div and 
change the height, width, left, top, and other settings.
Stacking and changing 
visibility of AP Divs
A powerful feature of AP Divs is their maneuverability: You can stack them on 
top of each other and make them visible or invisible. To stack AP Divs, simply 
drag one AP Div on top of another. Unlike other elements in a Web page, AP 
Divs give you complete layout control by including the capability to overlap 
one another. You can use AP Divs to position and layer any element on a 
page. For example, to overlap images, simply place each image in a separate 
AP Div and then move one AP Div so that it overlaps the other. To let you 

202
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
control which AP Div is on top, Dreamweaver provides two ways to change 
the stacking order with the Z Index. You can change the Z Index from the 
Property inspector or the AP Elements panel (see Figure 6-16). To open the 
AP Elements panel shown in Figure 6-16, choose Window➪AP Elements.
To change the stacking order and visibility of AP Divs, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a page that has two or more layers on it, such as the page with 
the jellyfish photos, as shown in Figure 6-17.
 
Figure 6-16: 
The AP 
Elements 
panel can 
be used to 
change the 
visibility and 
stacking 
order of AP 
Divs.
 
 
Figure 6-17: 
You can 
change the 
visibility 
of AP Divs 
by clicking 
under the 
eye icon.
 

203
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
 
2. Select an AP Div by clicking anywhere on the border outline of the 
AP Div.
 
3. Choose Window➪AP Elements to open the AP Elements panel.
 
 The AP Elements panel lists any AP Divs that have been inserted into a 
Web page.
 
 If you’re familiar with layers in Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia 
Fireworks, you may find some similarities here, such as the eye icon to 
control visibility and the capability to drag AP Divs around in the panel 
to change their order.
 
4. Reorder the stacking of the AP Divs by changing their corresponding 
Z Index numbers in the Property inspector or in the AP Elements 
panel.
 
 The lowest number is the bottommost layer. The highest number is the 
topmost layer. To change the stacking order, simply select the number 
under the Z Index field and enter a higher or lower number.
 
5. Click the eye icon to the left of any AP Div in the AP Elements panel 
to turn the layer visibility on or off.
 
 If no eye appears, the visibility is set to the default, which usually means 
on, except in the case of nested AP Divs. (You find out about nested AP 
Divs in the next section.) If the eye is open, the AP Div is visible on the 
screen and in the browser. If the eye is closed, the layer is invisible.
 
 If you want to prevent any of your AP Divs from overlapping, select the 
Prevent Overlaps check box in the AP Elements panel.
Managing Conflicting Styles
Be careful when you apply more than one style to the same element (some-
thing that’s easier to do than you may realize). The styles may conflict, and 
because browsers aren’t always consistent in how they display styles, the 
results can be inconsistent and undesirable.
For the most part, the latest versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer display 
all attributes applied to any element, even if they’re from different style rules, 
as long as the styles don’t conflict. If they do conflict, browsers prioritize 
styles depending on how the styles have been defined and the order in which 
they appear. The method for determining this priority is what cascading is all 
about.
Cascading refers to the way in which multiple styles can apply to — or cas-
cade over — the same element on a page. Because multiple styles can affect 
the same element, CSS has many rules to help prevent conflicts. These rules 
determine the priority each style should receive as a browser interprets 

204
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
styles. Style priorities are organized in a hierarchical order and work in a 
kind of a top-down fashion, similar to the way water cascades over rocks as it 
flows down a stream.
To help you better understand how styles cascade, consider this example. 
You can create a style for an entire page by redefining the <body> tag, the 
HTML tag that surrounds all the content displayed in the main window of a 
browser. So, for example, you could redefine the <body> tag with a rule that 
makes the default font for all text on your page Arial. Then you could redefine 
the <h1> tag with a rule that makes your headlines Garamond. And then the 
browser would have to determine how to display your headline based on this 
conflicting information. Should the headline be Arial because the page font is 
set to Arial in the <body> tag or should it be Garamond because that’s the 
font in the <h1> tag?
To resolve this kind of conflict, CSS follows a hierarchy that can get rather 
complicated, but one of the simplest things to remember is that the closer 
a style is to an element (more specifically, a style defines an element), the 
higher that style’s priority. So, as you might imagine, the headline style 
overrides the page style because it more specifically defines the style of the 
headline than the body style, which applies to the entire page.
CSS selectors also follow a hierarchy. Styles created with ID selectors are 
given priority over styles created with class, and both are given higher 
priority than styles that use the tag selector to redefine existing HTML tags. 
When styles have the same priority, deciding which is highest comes down 
to which style most specifically applies to an element.
Another basic guideline is that CSS rules get the highest priority, followed 
by HTML presentation attributes (for example, align, color, face, and 
bgcolor), followed by the browser default settings (font type and font size, 
for example). CSS rules always get the highest priority in any scenario. But 
within CSS, internal style sheets have priority over external style sheets, and 
inline styles, which are styles defined within the line of HTML code where the 
tag appears, get the highest priority.
Using Design Time Style Sheets
 
After you become savvy about using style sheets, you’ll find that working with 
external style sheets affords the most power because you can link to them 
from multiple pages in your site rather than having to create a new internal 
style sheet for each page in your site. You have the added advantage in that 
you can easily alter your styles in just one place if you need to make changes 
after styles are applied. Even better, you can create multiple external style 
sheets as part of the design process and use a Dreamweaver feature — design 
time style sheets — to switch between them as you work on your document.

205
 Chapter 6: Creating CSS Layouts
One benefit of the design time style sheets feature is that you can view how 
different external style sheets affect your page without linking to them. This 
feature is a great way to quickly switch between style sheets in a document 
and explore various what-if scenarios with the style sheets you create before 
you apply them. You may begin to like this feature because you can play 
around with and explore the full power of CSS. After you decide that you like 
a particular style sheet, you can apply it to your page as you do any other 
style sheet. 
 
Design time style sheets affect only the appearance of styles in Dreamweaver. 
Because they’re not real links, they show up only at runtime when a 
Dreamweaver document is open. Design time style sheet info is also stored 
in a design note file. If you want to preserve your design time style sheet 
info, be sure that you don’t delete the corresponding design note file.
To set up design time style sheets, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Format➪CSS Styles➪Design-Time.
 
 The Design Time Style Sheets dialog box appears.
 
2. To work with a specific style sheet, click the Add Item button (+) 
above the Show Only at Design Time field.
 
 The Select File dialog box appears, and you can select a CSS file. 
Remember that CSS files usually end with a .css extension. You can 
also add multiple CSS files by clicking the Add button again.
 
3. To hide a specific style sheet, click the Add Item button (+) above the 
Hide at Design Time field and select from the Select File dialog box 
the style you want to hide.
 
4. To delete a listed style sheet from either category, select the style 
sheet and click the Remove Item button (–) to delete it.

I
n the early days of Web design, HTML tables offered one of the only options 
for creating complex page layouts. By splitting and merging table cells and 
using them as containers for text and images, Web developers could create 
intricate page designs despite the limits of HTML. Most were frustrated by this 
solution.
Using tables to create designs was far from ideal, and we often had to resort 
to special tricks, such as using a clear GIF to control spacing (see the sidebar, 
“The transparent, or clear, GIF trick,” later in this chapter). But at least with 
tables you could position text, images, and other elements, anywhere you 
wanted on a page (well, almost anywhere). For example, you could use a table 
to align two columns of text side by side with a headline across the top like the 
format you might see in a newspaper or magazine. Because you could make 
the borders of a table invisible, you could use tables to create these kinds of 
designs without the table itself being visible on the page.
Today CSS has completely changed the way Web pages are created. 
Tables are still an ideal way to present tabular data on the Internet: For 
example, just about any content you could display in a spreadsheet can be 
formatted easily and effectively with a table. But tables are no longer the 
recommended solution for creating any other page layouts. Today, most 
professional designers use CSS to create page designs because these pages 
download faster, are easier to update, and are more flexible and accessible 
than tables ever were. Chapters 5 and 6 are dedicated to CSS and the latest 
developments in Web design.

208
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
This chapter is designed to help you appreciate how to create and edit tables 
in Dreamweaver. Even though tables are no longer recommended for most Web 
page layouts, you still find them used on many Web sites; so I’ve included a few 
tips for working with tables for page layouts, as well as formatting and sorting 
tabular data with tables in Dreamweaver.
Creating HTML Tables
Tables are made up of three basic elements: rows, columns, and cells. If 
you’ve ever worked with a spreadsheet program, you’re probably familiar 
with tables. Tables in HTML are quite similar when it comes to working with 
tabular data. In most cases, you’ll want to create a row of headings along the 
side or top of a table and then columns and rows that can be populated with 
text, images, and other data.
The code behind an HTML table is a complex series of <tr>, <th>, and <td> 
tags that indicate table rows, table header, and table data cells, respectively. 
Figuring out how to type those tags so that they create a series of little boxes 
on a Web page was never an intuitive process. If you wanted to merge or split 
cells to create rows or columns with varying numbers of cells, you faced a 
truly complex challenge.
Thank the cybergods that you have Dreamweaver to make this process easy. 
With Dreamweaver, you can easily
 
 Create tables and modify both the appearance and the structure of a 
table by simply clicking and dragging its edges.
 
 Add any type of content to a cell, such as images, text, and multimedia 
files — even nested tables.
 
 Use the Property inspector to merge and split cells, add color to the 
background or borders, and change the vertical and horizontal alignment of 
elements within a cell.
You can create tables in Standard or Expanded mode in Dreamweaver:
 
 Expanded mode, as shown in Figure 7-1, makes it easier to select inside 
and around tables by adding space around table borders. However, the 
display of a table changes in Expanded mode — it literally expands table 
cells. The added space makes editing content within tables easier, but 
the added space also changes the display.
 
 Standard mode, as shown in Figure 7-2, is more consistent with how 
tables will appear in a browser, so generally do most of your table 
editing, especially resizing and moving tables, in this mode.

209
 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
You can switch between these two modes by clicking the Standard and 
Expanded mode buttons in the Layout menu bar at the top of the work area, 
as shown in Figures 7-1 and 7-2.

How wide should you make a table?
Designers often wonder how wide to make a 
table when they’re using tables to control page 
layout. My advice is that if you’re designing 
your pages for an 800 x 600 screen resolution 
(still a popular resolution among Internet users), 
a safe bet is to make your table no more than 
780 pixels wide and center it in the middle of the 
page. That leaves a little room on each side to 
prevent the appearance of sideways scrollbars 
and causes the table to “float” in the middle 
of the page if users have a larger monitor. You 
also have the option of specifying a percentage 
width. For example, you can set the width of 
a table to 80 percent, and the table will fill 80 
percent of the browser window no matter how 
wide the screen or the resolution of the monitor.

Creating Tables in Standard Mode
Although Expanded mode is useful for selecting and editing the contents of a 
table, Standard mode is best for creating tables. The following tips can help 
you create a table, and the sections that follow explain how to further refine it:
 
 
 You can insert a table by choosing Insert➪Table or by clicking the 
Table icon in the Common or Layout Insert panel.
 
 When you insert a new table, the Table dialog box, as shown in Figure 
7-3, makes it easy to specify many table settings at once. Don’t worry 
about getting them all perfect; you can always change these options later.
 
 You can edit all the table options, except the Accessibility options, in 
the Property inspector. When you select a table or cell, the attributes 
appear in the Property inspector at the bottom of the work area. Click 
the border of any table to select the entire table, and the Property 
inspector displays the table options, as shown in Figure 7-4. To view all 
the options, click the expander arrow in the lower-right corner of the 
Property inspector. (All these options are described in the next section.)

 Select a table with the Select Table command. If you’re having trouble 
selecting the table (sometimes selecting the entire table and not just an 
individual cell is tricky), simply place your cursor anywhere inside the 
table and choose Modify➪Table➪Select Table.
Choosing your table’s appearance
When you select a table in Dreamweaver, the Property inspector gives you 
access to the following table options for customizing the appearance of your 
table:
 
 Table: Provides a text area where you can enter a name for a table. This 
name, or ID, is useful for targeting the table in scripts.
 
 Rows: Displays the number of rows in the table. You can alter the size of 
the table by changing the number. Be careful, though: If you enter a smaller 
number, Dreamweaver deletes the bottom rows — contents and all.

212
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Cols: Displays the number of columns in the table. You can alter the size 
of the table by changing the number. Again, if you enter a smaller number, 
Dreamweaver deletes the columns on the right side of the table — contents 
and all.
 
 W (width): Displays the width of the table. You can alter the width by 
changing the number. You can specify the width as a percentage or a 
value in pixels. Values expressed as a percentage increase or decrease 
the table’s size relative to the size of the user’s browser window or any 
enclosing container, such as another table or a <div> tag.
 
 Table dimensions expressed as a percentage enable you to create a table 
that changes in size when the browser window is resized. For example, 
if you want a table to always take up 75 percent of the browser window, 
no matter how big the user’s monitor or display area, set the size as a 
percentage. If you want a table to always be the same size — that is, to 
remain the same size regardless of the browser window size — choose 
pixels rather than percentages for your table width. See the nearby sidebar, 
“How wide should you make a table?” for more help selecting a width that 
displays well on most browsers.
 
 If a table is inserted inside another container, such as a <div> tag or 
a table with a fixed width, it doesn’t change size based on the browser 
window but is sized based on the container.
 
 Note: In Dreamweaver CS4, you no longer find an H (height) field. As a best 
practice, most designers don’t specify a height for a table because the 
contents of a table, such as the font size text is displayed in) may change 
from one visitor to another (depending on user’s system and settings).
 
 CellPad: Specifies the space between the contents of a cell and its border.
 
 CellSpace: Specifies the space between table cells.
Make sure the table fits the contents
Be aware that table cells automatically adjust 
to accommodate whatever you insert into them. 
For example, if you create a cell that’s 100 pixels 
wide and then insert a 300-pixel-wide image, 
the table cell expands to fit the image. This can 
cause problems if the overall size of the table 
isn’t set wide enough to accommodate all the 
objects within the table cells. When you build 
your tables, be aware of the size of the images 
and multimedia files you’re inserting into cells 
or you may have unpredictable results. For 
example, if you set a table to a total width of 
400 pixels and then insert 600 pixels worth of 
images, the table is forced to adjust in a way 
that contradicts the settings, when it does, some 
content may get cut off or expand beyond the 
desired width of the page layout. Worse yet, the 
table may not appear the same in all browsers 
as different browser try to accommodate these 
errors in different ways.

 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
 
 Align: Controls the alignment of the table. The options are Default, Left, 
Center, and Right. As a general rule, the Default setting aligns the table 
from the left side of the browser window or other container.
 
 Border: Controls the size of the border around the table. The larger the 
number, the thicker the border. If you want the border to be invisible, 
set it to 0.
 
 Class: Provides easy access to style sheet options. (See Chapters 5 and 6 
for more on CSS.)
 
 Clear and Convert: The icons in the lower-left area of the Property 
inspector (click the expander arrow in the lower-right corner to view 
them) provide these formatting options:
 
• Clear Row Heights and Clear Column Widths enable you to 
remove all height and width values at one time.
 
• Convert Table Widths to Pixels and Convert Table Widths to 
Percents enable you to automatically change Width settings from 
percentages to pixels. Pixels specify a fixed width; a percent setting 
means the browser automatically adjusts the specified percentage 
of the browser display area.
 
You can also apply formatting options and change the attributes of any 
element, such as text, an image, or a multimedia file, that you’ve placed 
within a table cell. To do so, click to select the element and then use 
the options in the CSS or HTML Property inspector to make any desired 
changes, just as you would if the element wasn’t in a table cell.
Making tables more accessible
When you develop tables, you can do a few simple things to make your Web 
pages and your content, more accessible. One of the most important is to use 
the Table Header (<th>) tag for table headings. The <th> or Table Header 
tag works much like the <td>, Table Data tag, to create table cells, except 
that the <th> tag adds bold formatting and centering to content. You can 
alter the formatting of the <th> tag by creating a tag style (see Chapter 5 
for how to do that), but make sure you use the <th> no matter what, as any 
content that’s contained in that tag will be recognized by screen readers and 
other programs as the header content of the table.
 
When you create a new table, don’t skip the Accessibility options at the 
bottom of the Table dialog box (refer to Figure 7-3). They’re important for 
anyone who uses a browser that reads Web pages, such as those used by 
people with limited vision. If you enter a table caption, it’s displayed within 
the table. (You can specify with the Align Caption option where the caption 
appears.) The Table Summary doesn’t appear in a Web browser and is used 
only to describe the table for visitors who can’t see the table of contents.

214
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Specifying cell options
In addition to changing overall table settings, you can specify options for 
individual cells within a table. When you select a cell, which you can do by 
clicking to place the cursor anywhere inside the cell area, the Property 
inspector changes to display the individual properties for that cell (see Figure 
7-5), such as the formatting and alignment of the contents of a particular cell.
 
In Dreamweaver CS4, the Property inspector features both HTML and CSS 
settings. CSS settings are generally preferred and work the same for the 
contents of a table cell as they do for content anywhere else on a Web page. 
(See Chapters 5 and 6 for more on using CSS.)
 
Figure 7-5: 
The 
Property 
inspector 
displays cell 
properties 
when <td> 
or <th> 
tags are 
selected.
 
You can also change multiple cells at the same time. For example, suppose that 
you want to have some (but not all) cells in your table take on a certain color 
background and style of text. You can apply the same properties to multiple 
cells by selecting more than one cell at a time before choosing the settings in 
the Property inspector. To select adjacent cells, press the Shift key while 
clicking to select cells. To select multiple cells that aren’t adjacent, press the 
Ctrl key (the Ô key on the Mac) and click each cell you want to select. Any 
properties you change in the Property inspector apply to all selected cells.
 
If you’re having trouble selecting an individual cell because it contains an 
image, click the image and then use either the ← or → key on your keyboard 
to move the cursor and deselect the image, which activates the Property 
inspector and displays the options for that cell.
When one or more cells are selected (they have to be adjacent for this to 
work), the top half of the Property inspector controls the formatting of text 
and URLs within the table cells. The lower half of the Property inspector 
provides these table cell attribute options (refer to Figure 7-5):

215
 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
 
 Merge Cells icon: Merges two or more cells. To merge cells, you must 
first select two or more cells by clicking and dragging or by pressing 
either the Shift or Ctrl key while selecting multiple cells.
 
 Split Cell icon: Splits one cell into two. When you select this option, a 
dialog box lets you specify whether you want to split the row (you split 
the cell horizontally) or the column (you split the cell vertically). You 
can then specify the number of columns or rows, which controls how 
many times the cell divides. Note that you can apply the Split Cell option 
to only one cell at a time.
 
 Horz: Controls the horizontal alignment of the cell contents.
 
 Vert: Controls the vertical alignment of the cell contents.
 
 W: Controls the width of the cell.
 
 H: Controls the height of the cell.
 
 No Wrap: Prevents word wrapping within the cell. The cell widens to 
accommodate all text while you type or paste it into a cell. (Normally, 
the excess text just moves down to the next line and increases the 
height of the cell.)
 
 Header: Formats a cell’s contents by using a header tag, which displays 
the text in bold and centered by default in most Web browsers.
 
 Bg (color): Click in the color well to select a background color from the 
color palette or enter a hexadecimal color code into the text field. If you 
use the color palette, the hexadecimal code is entered automatically 
into the Bg color field.
Formatting multiple columns in a table
When you’re working with lots of cells in a table, you may want to format 
multiple cells in the same way. Dreamweaver makes that task easy, whether 
you want to align numbers, make the headings bold, or change the color 
scheme. Before you start planning how to line up all your numbers perfectly, 
be aware that you don’t have as much control in HTML as you have in a 
program, such as Excel, where you can align numbers to the decimal point. 
You can, however, align the content of columns to the left, right, or center. 
Thus, if you use the same number of digits after the decimal point in all your 
numbers, you can get them to line up. For example, if one price is $12.99 and 
another is $14, express the latter as $14.00; then, when you right align, the 
numbers line up properly. (If your columns still aren’t lining up the way you 
want them to, consider using a monospace font, such as Courier, which lines 
up better.)
The steps in this section explain how to create a table in Standard mode and 
align all the data cells to the right so that the numbers or other content align 
consistently. You can use these exercises also to align the contents of table 

216
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
cells to the left or center and to apply other formatting options, such as bold 
or italic. In these steps, I insert the data into the table after I create the table 
in Dreamweaver.
 
If you want to import data from a table you’ve created in a program, such as 
Word or Excel, see the section, “Importing Table Data from Other Programs,” 
later in this chapter. If you’re working with a table that already has data in it 
and just want to format or align the cells, go directly to Step 7.
If you’re starting from scratch, create a new, blank HTML page and follow 
these steps from the beginning:
 
1. Make sure that you’re in Standard mode. (Choose View➪Table 
Mode➪Standard Mode.)
 
2. Click to place the cursor where you want to create a table.
 
 In both Standard and Expanded modes, tables are created automatically 
in the top-left area of the page, unless you insert them after other content.
 
3. Click the Table icon on the Common or Layout Insert panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Table. The Insert Table dialog box 
appears.
 
4. In the appropriate boxes, type the number of columns and rows you 
want to include in your table.
 
 Remember you can always add or remove cells later with the Property 
inspector.
 
5. Specify the width, border, cell padding, and cell spacing.
 
6. Choose the header option that best corresponds to the layout you want 
for your table to create a row of header cells across the top, side, or both.
 
7. Add a caption and summary in the Accessibility section and click OK.
 
 The table automatically appears on the page.
 
8. Click to place the cursor in a cell and then type the data you want in 
that cell. Repeat for each cell.
 
 Alternatively, you can use Edit➪Paste Special to insert columnar data 
from another program, such as Excel.
 
9. Select the column or row for which you want to change the alignment.
 
 Place the cursor in the first cell in the column or row you want to align; 
then, click and drag your mouse to highlight the other columns or rows 
that you want to change.
 
10. Choose an alignment option from the Horz (horizontal) or Vert (vertical) 
drop-down lists in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
 The content of the cell adjusts to match the selected alignment option.

217
 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
 
 Alternatively, you can access many formatting options, including 
alignment options, by selecting a table and then right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac).
 
 You can also apply other formatting options, such as bold or italic, to 
selected cells and their contents by choosing the option from the from 
the Property inspector.
 
Figure 7-6: 
The 
Property 
inspector 
displaying 
the Table 
options.
 
 
If you want to format one cell in a column or row differently from the others, 
click to place the cursor in just that cell and then click one of the formatting 
options in the Property inspector. You can also choose to align multiple cells 
that aren’t contiguous (they don’t touch each other) by pressing and holding 
the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac) in Windows while you click the cells you want to 
select. Any options you change on the pop-up menu or in the Table Property 
inspector apply to all selected cells.
 
You can also use CSS to format the cells within a table. To do so, select the 
cell or cells, click the CSS button in the Property inspector, and use the CSS 
options to create and apply styles while you format the table. You find 
instructions for creating styles, which can be applied to tables as well as any 
other elements in a Web page, in Chapters 5 and 6.
Vertical alignment solves common problem
If you’re having trouble getting the contents of 
adjacent cells to line up with each other, setting 
vertical alignment to Top may solve your problem. 
A common frustration when you’re building 
tables is that you have two or more rows side 
by side with text in one and images in the other, 
and you want the top of the image and the top 
of the text to line up. Often they don’t line up 
because they’re different lengths, and the table 
is trying to adjust the contents to best use the 
space within their respective cells. The solution 
is simple: Select all the cells you want to align, 
and in the Property inspector, change vertical 
alignment to Top. Seemingly like magic, all 
the content jumps right to the top of the cells 
and lines up perfectly. This is such a common 
problem that I routinely set the vertical 
alignment of table cells to Top.

218
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Merging and splitting table cells
Sometimes, the easiest way to modify the number of cells in a table is to 
merge cells (combine two or more cells into one) or split cells (split one cell 
into two or more rows or columns). With this technique, you can vary the 
space in table sections and customize their structures. For example, you 
may want a long cell space across the top of your table for a banner and then 
multiple cells below it so that you can control the spacing between columns 
of text or images. The following two sets of steps show you how to merge and 
split cells in a table.
To merge cells, create a new HTML page or open an existing HTML file and 
follow these steps (see Chapter 2 for more information on creating files):
 
1. Choose Insert➪Table and create a table with 4 rows and 4 columns, a 
75 percent width, and a border of 1.
 
2. Choose the header option that best corresponds to the layout you 
want for your table to create a row of header cells across the top, side, 
or both.
 
3. Add a caption and summary in Accessibility section.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The table appears on the page.
 
5. Highlight two or more adjacent cells by clicking and dragging the 
mouse from the first cell to the last.
 
 You can merge only cells that are adjacent to one another and in the 
same row or column.
 
 
6. Click the Merge Selected Cells icon, in the lower-left region of the 
Property inspector (as shown in Figure 7-7), to merge the selected 
cells into a single cell.
 
 The cells are merged into a single cell by using the Colspan or 
Rowspan attributes. These HTML attributes make a single cell merge 
with adjacent cells by spanning extra rows or columns in the table.
 
Figure 7-7: 
The 
Property 
inspector 
includes 
small icons 
that merge 
and split 
cells.
 

219
 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
To split a cell, create a new table or open a page with an existing table and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place the cursor inside any cell you want to split.
 
 
2. Click the Split Selected Cell icon, in the lower-left region of the 
Property inspector.
 
 The Split Cell dialog box appears.
 
3. Select Rows or Columns in the dialog box, depending on how you 
want to divide the cell.
 
 You can split a cell into however many new rows or columns you want.
 
4. Type the number of rows or columns you want to create.
 
 The selected cell is split into the number of rows or columns you 
entered.
Sorting Table Data
When you’re working with lots of columnar data, you want to be able to 
sort that data just as you do in a spreadsheet program, such as Excel. In 
Dreamweaver, you can sort data even after it’s formatted in HTML (something 
you couldn’t easily do before). You still don’t have as many options as you do 
in Excel. For example, you can sort an entire table based on a specified row, 
but you can’t sort different rows individually.
To use the Sort Table Data feature, create a new, blank HTML page, add a 
table with several rows and columns, and add some content. (I explain how 
in the preceding section.) You may also open an existing page with a table of 
columnar data. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the table you want to sort.
 
 Place the cursor in any cell of the table you want to sort.
 
2. Choose View➪Table Mode➪Standard Mode.
 
3. Choose Commands➪Sort Table.
 
 The Sort Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-8.
 
4. Specify which column you want to sort by and then choose 
Alphabetically or Numerically; and Ascending or Descending.
 
 You can set up one or two sorts to happen simultaneously and opt whether 
to include the first row and whether to keep the <tr> (Table Row) attributes 
with a sorted row by selecting Keep All Row Colors the Same.

5. Click OK.
 
 The selected cells are sorted, just as they are in a program, such as 
Excel. (Pretty cool, huh?)
Importing Table Data from 
Other Programs
Manually converting financial data or other spreadsheet information can be 
tedious. Fortunately, Dreamweaver includes a special feature that enables 
you to insert table data created in other applications, such as Word or Excel. 
To use this feature, the table data must be saved from the other program in 
a delimited format — the columns of data are separated by tabs, commas, 
colons, semicolons, or another type of delimiter. Most spreadsheet and 
database applications, as well as Microsoft Word, enable you to save data in 
a delimited format; files with a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file extension 
are one example. Consult the documentation for the application you’re using 
to find out how. After the data is saved in a delimited format, you can import 
it into Dreamweaver.
To import table data into Dreamweaver after it’s been saved in a delimited 
format (such as CSV) or in its native application (such as Access or Excel), 
create a new, blank HTML page or open an existing file and follow these steps 
to import the data:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Tabular Data or choose Insert➪Table 
Objects➪Import Tabular Data.
 
 The Import Tabular Data dialog box appears (see Figure 7-9).
 
2. In the Data File text box, type the name of the file you want to import 
or use the Browse button to locate the file.

221
 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
 
Figure 7-9: 
You can 
import 
tabular data 
into Dream-
weaver from 
other 
programs, 
such as 
Excel. 
 
3. In the Delimiter drop-down list, select the delimiter format you used 
when you saved your file in the native application.
 
 The delimiter options are Tab, Comma, Semicolon, Colon, and Other. 
You should have made this choice when you exported the data from the 
original program in which you created it, such as Excel or Access. If you 
don’t remember what you chose, you can always go to the original 
program and export the data again. You must select the correct option 
for your data to import correctly.
 
4. Select the table width.
 
 If you choose Fit to Data, Dreamweaver automatically creates the table to 
fit the data being imported. If you choose Set, you must specify a percent or 
pixel size.
 
5. (Optional) Specify the cell padding and cell spacing only if you want 
extra space around the data in the table to be created.
 
6. (Optional) Choose an option from the Format Top Row drop-down list 
only if you want to format the data in the top row of the table.
 
 Your options are Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic.
 
7. Specify the border size.
 
 The default is 1, which puts a small border around the table. Choose 0 if 
you don’t want the border to be visible. Choose a larger number if you 
want a thicker border.
 
8. Click OK to automatically create a table with the imported data.
Dreamweaver also enables you to export data from a table into a delimited format. 
This capability is useful if you want to export data from a Web page so that you 
can import it into another program, such as Word or Excel, or into a database 
program, such as FileMaker or Access. To export data from Dreamweaver, place 
the cursor anywhere in the table and choose File➪Export➪Table. In the Export 
Table dialog box, choose from the options on the Delimiter drop-down list (you 
can choose Tab, Space, Comma, Semicolon, or Colon). From the Line Breaks drop-
down list, specify the operating system (you can choose Windows, Mac, or UNIX).

222
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Using Tables for Spacing and Alignment
Tables have long been used on the Web to create page layouts that require 
more than basic alignment of elements on a page. In the early days of Web 
design, using tables was one of the only ways you could get around many of 
the limitations of basic HTML and accomplish some otherwise impossible 
design feats, such as evenly spacing bullets, creating columns side-by-side on 
a page, and spanning headlines or images across multiple columns.
Today, CSS offers a much better option for these kinds of designs, but many 
people are still using tables and you may have Web sites that you created in 
this way (or you may inherit a design that uses them). If you’re working on a 
site that’s designed with tables to create a page layout for any content that 
isn’t tabular, such as the Chocolate Game Rules page, as shown in Figure 
7-10, consider redesigning the page layout with <div> tags and CSS, which 
are covered in detail in Chapter 6.
 
Figure 7-10: 
Many two-
column 
page 
layouts, 
such as the 
one shown 
here, were 
created 
with HTML 
tables.
 

223
 Chapter 7: Coming to the HTML Table
Nesting Tables within Tables
Placing tables within tables, or nested tables, can help you create extremely 
complex designs. For example, with a table that contains all the scores of all 
the baseball games in a season, you could add a smaller table inside one cell 
to include detailed stats of an exceptional game. You create nested tables by 
inserting a table within a cell of another table. 
 
The best Web designs communicate the information to your audience in the 
most elegant and understandable way and are easy to download. To make 
sure that your designs don’t get too messy, remember these guidelines:
 
 A table within a table within a table is nested three levels deep. Anything 
more than that gets hairy.
 
 Pages that use nested tables take longer to download because browsers 
have to interpret each table individually before rendering the page. For 
some designs, the slightly longer download time is worth it, but in most 
cases, you’re better off adding or merging cells in one table, as I explain 
in the section “Merging and splitting table cells,” earlier in this chapter. 
One situation that makes a nested table worth the added download time 
is when you want to place a table of financial or other data in the midst 
of a complex page design.
To place a table inside another table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place the cursor where you want to create the first table.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Table.
 
 The Insert Table dialog box appears.
 
3. Type the number of columns and rows you need for your design.
 
4. Set the Width option to whatever is appropriate for your design and 
then click OK.
 
 The table is sized automatically to the width you set.
 
5. Click to place the cursor in the cell in which you want to place the 
second table.
 
6. Repeat Steps 2–4, specifying the number of columns and rows you 
want and the width of the table.
 
 The new table appears inside the cell of the first table.
 
7. Type the information that you want in the nested table cells as you 
would enter content in any other table.

Framing Your Pages
In This Chapter
 Introducing HTML frames
 Creating frame pages
 Knowing when not to use frames
 Setting targets and links
 Changing the properties of frames
U
sing HTML frames to create a Web site is a little like putting pink 
plastic flamingos on your front lawn — some people love them, some 
people hate them.
Thus making the most of frames requires appreciating not only the best way 
to create frames but also the best ways to use them and why so many Web 
designers have vowed never to use them. Many experienced Web designers 
say you should never use frames because they can confuse visitors as they 
navigate around a site and because frames hide the actual URL of each page 
(only the main address of the main frame page is displayed in a browser, 
even when a visitor clicks a link that opens another page in the frameset).
These are valid reasons to avoid using frames, but I still think it’s important 
to include instructions for creating frames in this book. Afterall, even if all 
you want to do is redesign a site that was created with frames, you still need 
at least a basic understanding of how frames work just to deconstruct the 
existing site before you re-create it in a new layout option, such as the much-
preferred CSS approach covered in Chapter 6.
Overall, I try to take a non-judgmental approach to frames — I don’t recommend 
frames, but I can think of a few instances when frames come in handy, such as 
when you want to bring in content from another Web site and still maintain your 
own navigation and logo. Of course, you should do this only with permission 
from the other site (see the sidebar later in this chapter, “Resist using frames 
when linking to other Web sites”).
Frames are used, for example, by a number of universities and other large 
institutions to rein in the many different designs created by different 
departments while still providing some consistent navigation and branding. 

226
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Frames aren’t the only way to solve the problem of many Web designers 
working on one site, but they are a common approach to this common 
problem.
For all these reasons, this chapter covers how to build HTML framesets in 
Dreamweaver and also discusses when frames are most useful and when 
you may be better off avoiding them. Frames add a wide range of design 
possibilities, but they can also be frustrating to viewers. As you go through 
this chapter, consider not only how to create frames but also whether they 
are really the best solution for your Web site project.
Introducing the Basics of HTML Frames
Frames enable you to display multiple HTML pages in one browser window 
and control the content of each framed area individually. Web pages that use 
frames are split into separate sections — or individual frames. All the frames 
together make up a frameset. Behind the scenes, each frame of the frameset is 
a separate HTML file, which makes a page with frames a little complicated to 
create, even with Dreamweaver.
If you choose to create your frame files in a text editor, you have to juggle 
multiple pages, working on one frame at a time, and you can see what you 
create only when you preview your work in a browser. The visual editor in 
Dreamweaver makes creating frames a lot easier because you can view all 
the HTML files that make up the frameset at the same time and can edit them 
while they appear in the way in which they will appear in a browser.
Web developers commonly use frames to create a design with two or more 
sections within one browser window. Each section consists of a different 
HTML page, and you can place links in one section that, when selected, 
display information in another page in a different section of the frameset 
within the same browser window.
As a navigational feature, frames enable you to keep some information 
constant while changing other information in the same browser window. 
For example, you can keep a list of links visible in one frame and display 
the information each link brings up in another frame, as the site shown in 
Figure 8-1 does.
You can create as many frames as you want within a browser window. 
Unfortunately, some people overuse them and create designs that are so 
complex and broken up that they’re neither aesthetically appealing nor easily 
navigable. Putting too many frames on one page can also make a site hard to 
read because the individual windows are too small. This has led many Web 
surfers to passionately hate frames. And some sites that rushed to implement 
frames when they were first introduced have since either abandoned frames 
or minimized their use.

227
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
 
Figure 8-1: 
With 
frames, you 
can display 
multiple 
pages in 
one browser 
window.
 
Here’s a list of guidelines when using frames:
 
 Don’t use frames just for the sake of using frames. If you have a 
compelling reason to use frames, create an elegant and easy-to-follow 
frameset. But don’t do it just because Dreamweaver makes creating 
them relatively easy.
 
 Limit the use of frames and keep files small. Remember that each 
frame you create represents another HTML file. Thus, a frameset with 
three frames requires a browser to fetch and display four Web pages 
(each page file plus a fourth that holds them all together). Displaying 
them all in one browser may dramatically increase download time.
 
 Turn off frame borders. Browsers that support frames also support 
the capability to turn off the border that divides frames in a frameset. 
If you turn off the borders, your pages look cleaner. Frame borders, as 
shown in Figure 8-1, are thick and an ugly gray, and they can break up 
a nice design. You can change the color in the Property inspector, but 
I still recommend that you use them only when you feel that they’re 
absolutely necessary. I show you how to turn off frame borders in the 
“Changing Frame Properties” section toward the end of this chapter.
 
 Don’t use frames when you can use CSS instead. By far the preferred way to 
create a page layout today is to use CSS, covered in Chapters 5 and 6. If your 
goal is to create a layout for photos, like the one featured in this chapter, 
consider also using the Swap Image behavior covered in Chapter 10.

228
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Don’t place frames within frames. The windows get too darned small to 
be useful for much of anything, and the screen looks horribly complicated. 
You can also run into problems when your framed site links to another site 
displayed in your frameset. The “Resist using frames when linking to other 
Web sites” sidebar provides many more reasons to limit using frames inside 
of frames.
 
 Put in alternate <noframes> content. The number of users surfing the 
Web with browsers that don’t support frames becomes smaller every 
day. Still, showing them something other than a blank page is a good 
idea. I usually put in a line that says, “This site uses frames and requires 
a frames-capable browser to view.” <noframes> content can also be 
read by search engines, which may otherwise fail to catalog the content 
within framed pages.
Understanding How Frames Work
Frames are a bit complicated, but Dreamweaver helps make the whole process 
of creating them somewhat easier. When you create a Web page with frames 
in Dreamweaver, remember that each frame area is a separate HTML file, and 
Dreamweaver saves each frame area as a separate page. You also want to keep 
track of which file displays in which of the frames so that you can aim links 
properly.
Figure 8-2 shows a simple frameset example with three frames, each containing 
a different HTML page and different text (Page 1, Page 2, and Page 3) so that I 
can clearly refer to them in the following numbered steps.
In addition to the files that appear in each frame, create a separate HTML 
file to generate the frameset. This page doesn’t have a <body> tag, but it 
describes the frames and tells the browser how and where to display them. 
This gets a little complicated but don’t worry: Dreamweaver creates the 
frameset HTML file for you. I just want to give you a general understanding of 
all the files that you’re creating so that the following steps make more sense.
To help you understand how this works, look at the example in Figure 8-2. 
In this document, you see three frames, each displaying a different HTML 
page. The fourth HTML file that makes up the frame page contains the other 
frames but doesn’t show up in the browser. This file is the frameset file, and 
it describes where and how each frame is displayed. For example, whether 
they’re on the left, right, top, or bottom of the page and how large they are. 
The frameset file also contains other information, such as the name of each 
frame, which is used to specify which frame a link opens into, or targets. 
You find out more about linking frames in the “Setting Targets and Links in 
Frames” section, later in this chapter.

Creating a frameset in Dreamweaver
When you create a frameset page in Dreamweaver, you create multiple 
pages — the frameset file and each of the files that will be displayed initially 
within the frameset. When you edit the content of any of the frames in a 
frameset, you’re editing not the frameset file but the files that populate the 
framed regions within the frameset.
If you’re not using a program like Dreamweaver, you have to edit each of the files 
in a frameset separately, but Dreamweaver makes designing with frames easier 
by letting you edit the content of each frame in the context of the frameset as it 
will be displayed in a browser. If you can grasp this concept, you’ve come a long 
way toward understanding how frames work and how to use Dreamweaver to 
create and edit them. If it hasn’t sunk in yet, read on. After you start creating and 
editing framesets, all these concepts should make a lot more sense.
You can create frames in three ways in Dreamweaver:
 
 The simplest method is to use a predesigned frameset from 
Dreamweaver’s Samples collection. See the next section, “Creating a 
frameset from a sample.”

230
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 The second method is to create a page and then choose a predefined 
frameset from the Layout Insert panel, covered in the upcoming section 
“Creating a frameset using the Layout Insert panel.”
 
 The third method, which can also be used to alter a frameset created by 
either of the first two methods, is to split a single HTML file into two or 
more sections, which then become separate pages within a frameset. To 
split a page into two frames, choose Modify➪Frameset and then choose 
any of the four options: Split Frame Left, Split Frame Right, Split Frame 
Up, or Split Frame Down to divide the page accordingly.
 
 When you split a page that isn’t yet part of a frameset, Dreamweaver 
automatically generates an untitled page with the <frameset> tag and 
then additional untitled pages appear in each of the frames within the 
frameset. When that happens, you’re suddenly managing more than just 
one page. This concept is important to understand because you have 
to save and name each of these pages as a separate file, even though 
Dreamweaver makes it appear as though you’re working on only one 
page that’s broken into sections.
 
 In general, I recommend that you save new HTML files before inserting 
anything into them. However, the opposite is true when you work with 
frame files in Dreamweaver. Wait until after you create all the frames 
in your frameset and then save them one at a time; otherwise, tracking 
your files can get even more complicated and confusing. I explain more 
in the “Saving files in a frameset” section, later in this chapter.
Creating a frameset from a sample
To create a simple frameset in Dreamweaver, such as the one shown in 
Figure 8-2, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
A long list of 
predefined 
framesets 
among the 
Sample 
pages 
makes 
creating 
new frames 
easier.
 

231
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
 
2. From the icons on the left, select Page from Sample.
 
3. In the Sample Folder list, select Frameset.
 
 The predefined framesets are displayed in a list under the Sample Page 
category.
 
4. In the Sample Page list, select a Frameset design.
 
 When you click to select the name of a predefined frameset, a preview is 
displayed in the far right of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 The frameset is created automatically and opens in Dreamweaver’s 
workspace. If you have Accessibility alerts turned on in Dreamweaver’s 
Preferences, you’re prompted with an alert and an Accessibility dialog 
box, where you can enter Accessibility attributes for the frameset.
 
6. Click and drag any of the bars dividing the frames to adjust the size of 
the frame area.
 
7. To edit each section of the frameset, click inside the frame that you 
want to work on and edit it as you would any other HTML page.
 
 You can type text, insert images, create tables, and add any other features 
just as you do for any other page.
 
 For instructions on saving all the files in a frameset, continue with the 
instructions in the section “Saving files in a frameset,” later in this chapter.
Creating a frameset using the Layout Insert panel
 
 Another way to create frames is to select a predefined frameset from the 
Frames drop-down list, as shown in Figure 8-4. You find the Frames icon in 
the Layout Insert panel (available by clicking the Layout tab from the Insert 
panel at the top-right of the work area in the Designer workspace layout).
To create a framed page with the Frames icon on the Layout Insert panel, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Blank Page.
 
2. In the Page Type list, select HTML and then in the Layout list, select 
<none>.
 
3. Click the Create button to create a new blank page.
 
 A blank HTML page is created and opens in the main Dreamweaver 
workspace.
 
4. From the Layout Insert panel, click the Frames icon; in the drop-down 
list, select the design that most closely approximates the type of 
frameset you want to build (refer to Figure 8-4).
 
 The selected frameset is created automatically and opens in the 
Dreamweaver workspace, replacing the blank HTML page created in Step 3.

232
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
 Don’t worry if it isn’t exactly the design you want; you can alter it later.
 
5. Modify the frameset as needed.
 
 You can resize the frames by clicking and dragging the borders.
 
 You can also split frames by choosing Modify➪Frameset and then 
choosing to split the frame left, right, up, or down.
To save your files, continue with the instructions in the next section, “Saving 
files in a frameset.”
 
Figure 8-4: 
Click the

icon in the 
Layout 
Insert panel 
and select

predefined 
framesets in 
the Frames 
drop-down 
list.
 
Viewing frame borders
If you don’t see the borders of your frames 
displayed in Dreamweaver’s workspace, as you 
see in Figures 8-1, 8-2, and 8-4, you may need 
to change the View settings in Dreamweaver. 
To make frame borders visible, click to place 
your cursor in one of the frames within your 
frameset and choose View➪Visual Aids➪
Frame Borders. Your frame borders appear 
automatically in the workspace. To hide frame 
borders in Dreamweaver’s workspace, choose 
View➪Visual Aids➪Frame Borders again. Note 
that this doesn’t turn off the display of frame 
borders in a browser. If you don’t want your 
borders to be seen by visitors to your site, turn 
off frame borders, as described in the “Changing 
frame borders” section later in this chapter.

233
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
Saving files in a frameset
No matter what approach you take to create a frameset, you can choose 
from any of these three options to save any or all your frame documents. 
No matter which option you choose to save your pages, make sure you save 
them within the main root folder of your Web site. (See Chapter 2 for more on 
using Dreamweaver’s site definition features to establish a main root folder 
for your site.)
Similarly, after you save and name your documents the first time, you have 
the following options for saving a frame or the whole frameset again after you 
edit them:
 
 Save the whole shebang: If you haven’t yet saved the frameset, choosing 
File➪Save All saves all files in your frameset prompting you separately for a 
name for each frame. If you’ve already saved and named the files, the Save All 
command is useful when you make changes to several of the frames and want 
to save all the changes at once. I prefer this option, which is covered in detail 
in the following exercise, especially the first time you save a frameset.
 
 Save just one frame: To save an individual frame displayed in a frameset 
without saving all the other frames, place your cursor in the frame you 
want to save and choose File➪Save Frame and save or name it just as 
you save any other individual page. Dreamweaver saves only the file for 
the frame in which your cursor is located.
 
 Save only the page that defines the frameset: First, make sure the entire 
frameset is selected (you can do this by clicking in the upper-left corner 
of the workspace) and then choose File➪Save Frameset. If you haven’t 
selected the entire frameset, the Save Frameset option doesn’t appear on 
the File menu. Remember: This page doesn’t appear in any of the frames; 
it simply defines the entire display area, specifying which of the other 
pages appears in each frame as well as the position and size of the frames.
 
When you create a frameset, no matter which approach you take to create the 
frameset, it’s good practice to wait to save your pages until after you’ve created 
all your frames. Saving all your frames at once can make it easier to name them 
in a way that will help you keep track of them later. Remember, a frameset 
consists of at least two HTML files, even though it appears as if you’re working 
on only one file in the Dreamweaver workspace. (That said, I still recommend 
you save the files before you start adding content to your pages, to make sure 
you don’t lose your work if your system or the program crashes.)
To save all the files in a frameset at once, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save All.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears, asking you to name the file and designate 
a folder to save it in. This is the first of several Save As dialog boxes you 
see (how many depends on how many pages your frameset contains).

234
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. Enter a name for the first file in the frameset.
 
 Dreamweaver suggests a name, but you can choose your own. 
 
 The first file you’re prompted to save when you use the Save All option, 
is the frameset file (the file that holds all the other frames in place). You 
can tell this by looking at the Dreamweaver Document window behind 
the Save As dialog box: The entire document has a thick dotted highlight 
around it, representing the frameset.
 
3. Browse your hard drive to locate the desired folder for the HTML files 
and then click the Save button.
 
 The first frameset file is saved, and a new Save As dialog box appears 
for the next one. After you save all the frames, the Save As dialog box 
disappears.
 
 Carefully naming the files as you save them helps identify which area 
they represent. Notice that when you’re prompted to save each file, 
Dreamweaver indicates the frame area by highlighting it with a dark, 
on-screen border behind the dialog box. I like names like frame1.html 
and frame2.html, or leftframe.html, rightframe.html because 
such names can help you distinguish between the files later.
Setting Targets and Links in Frames
One of the best features of frames is that you can change the contents of 
each frame separately within the Web browser. This feature opens a wide 
range of design possibilities that improves navigation for your site. One 
common way to use a frameset is to create a frame that displays a list of links 
to various pages of your site and then opens those links into another frame 
on the same page. This technique makes it possible to keep a list of links con-
stantly visible and makes navigation a lot simpler and more intuitive.
Setting links from a file in one frame so that the pages they link to open in 
another frame is like linking from one page to another, and that’s essentially 
what you’re doing. What makes linking within a frameset distinctive is that, in 
addition to indicating which page you want to open with the link, you have to 
specify which frame section it targets (opens into).
But before you can set those links, you need to do a few things: First, you 
need to create some other pages that you can link to (if you haven’t done 
so already). Create new pages as you would create any other pages in 
Dreamweaver, using any of the templates or sample page options, and then 
save each of the pages individually. If your pages already exist, you’re more 
than halfway there; it’s just a matter of linking to those pages.

235
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
The other thing you have to do before you can set links is to name each 
frame so that you can specify where the linked file loads. If you don’t, the 
page just replaces the frameset altogether when someone clicks the link, and 
this defeats the purpose of using frames in the first place.
Naming frames
Naming a frame is different from naming the file that the frame represents. You 
find out how to name the files in the previous section, “Saving files in a frameset.” 
The frame name is like a nickname that allows you to distinguish your frames 
from one another on a page and refer to them individually — this becomes 
important when you set links and want to target a link to open in a particular 
area of the frameset. The filename is the name of the HTML file for the frame. The 
frame name is the nickname you refer to when you want to set links.
You can see the names of your frames in the Frames panel, as shown on the 
right in Figure 8-5. If you’ve used one of Dreamweaver’s predefined framesets, 
the frames are named something like topFrame and mainframe. If you’re 
happy with the names that Dreamweaver automatically assigned to your 
frames, you can skip the following steps. If you created frames by splitting a 
document, the frames don’t have a name and you must complete the following 
steps before you can target your frames.
 
Figure 8-5: 
The Frames 
panel 
provides 
access to 
frame 
properties, 
such as 
frame 
names. 

236
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
To name a frame in a frameset or change the name of a frame, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open an existing frameset or create a new one.
 
 See the “Creating a frameset in Dreamweaver” section, earlier in this 
chapter, if you don’t know how to create a frameset.
 
2. Choose Window➪Frames.
 
 The Frames panel opens to the right of the work area (see Figure 8-5). 
The Frames panel is a miniature representation of the frames on 
your page that enables you to select different frames by clicking the 
corresponding frame area within the panel.
 
3. Click to place your cursor in the area of the Frames panel that 
corresponds to the frame you want to name.
 
 In Figure 8-5, I selected the top frame. You can click to select any of the 
frames in the panel. The Property inspector displays the properties for that 
particular frame. You can make any changes to the frame’s properties by 
altering the properties in the Property inspector after selecting the frame. 
Resist using frames when linking 
to other Web sites
I understand that most people don’t want to 
lose viewers to another site when they create a 
link, but that’s the nature of the Web. If your site 
is designed well, you shouldn’t have to worry 
about losing people. Instead, you should show 
them around your informative site and then 
politely guide them to other resources that they 
may find of interest — and let them go. If you 
link to another site and target that link within 
your frames, you keep users captive and usually 
leave them annoyed with you for taking up 
valuable browser space and making it harder 
to navigate to the site they’ve followed your 
link to visit. By displaying content from other 
sites within one or more of the frames in your 
site, you risk doing yourself far more harm than 
good.
If you insist on using frames when you link to 
another site, do so discreetly by placing a small, 
narrow frame across the bottom of the screen 
or the left side — not a wide band across the 
top, and certainly not more than one frame 
that still contains information from your site. 
Not only is this rude and ugly, but some people 
have been sued by sites that charged that using 
frames when the sites linked misled visitors into 
thinking the content belonged to the visitors 
when the content didn’t.
Another reason not to use frames when you link 
to someone else’s site is that other sites use 
frames, too. If you link a site that uses frames into 
a site that uses frames, you quickly create a mess 
of frames within frames that makes navigation 
confusing at best. Not everyone knows you 
can get out of frames by right-clicking a link 
in Windows, or clicking and holding a link on 
a Mac, and choosing Open Frame in Separate 
Window. Now that you know this trick, at least 
you can get out of a framed situation if you ever 
find yourself trapped in one.

237
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
You can also select the entire frameset by clicking the border around all the 
frames in the Frames panel. The Frames panel allows you to select only one 
frame or frameset at a time.
 
4. In the Frame Name text box on the left side of the Property inspector, 
type a name for the frame.
 
 Dreamweaver assigns names automatically when you save the files in a 
frameset. In the example shown in Figure 8-5, Dreamweaver assigned the 
names topFrame, mainFrame, and leftFrame. You can leave these 
names as is or change them to anything else in the Property inspector 
(just don’t use spaces or special characters in the names).
 
 In the example, I changed topFrame to bannerFrame. Name your 
frames in a way that makes sense to you and helps you remember what 
they are so you can better target them.
 
5. Choose File➪Save Frameset to save the frameset page.
 
 The frameset is the file you don’t see in the display area that describes 
the other frames and contains information, such as frame names.
 
 Remember, you can save any individual frame by placing your cursor in 
the frame and choosing File➪Save, or you can save all the files in your 
frameset (including the frameset page) by choosing File➪Save All. Refer 
to the “Saving files in a frameset” section, earlier in this chapter, for 
more information on saving frames.
Now that you identified or changed the names of your frames, you’re ready to 
start setting links that target frames. Don’t close these files yet — you want to 
use them to follow the steps in the next section to set links.
 
I like to save my work on a regular basis so that I never lose more than a 
few minutes of work if my system crashes or the power goes out. Be aware, 
however, that when you work with frames, you need to save all your pages to 
save your work.
Setting links to a target frame
Setting links in a frameset requires some preliminary work. If you jumped 
to this section without creating a frameset or naming your frames, you may 
want to refer to the sections earlier in this chapter. If you already have a 
frameset, have named the frames, and just want to find out how to set links, 
this section is where you want to be.
Setting links in a frameset is like setting any other links between pages, 
except you need to specify the target frame — the frame where the linked 
page will appear when a user clicks the link. For example, if you want a link 
in the left frame to control what’s in the main frame, specify the main frame 
as the target in the link. If you don’t specify a target, the link opens in the 

238
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
same frame the link is in. Because the most common reason to use frames is 
to keep navigation links in one frame and open their corresponding pages in 
another, you probably want to target a frame when you set a link.
If this seems confusing, don’t fret. After you try the following steps, it should 
become clear how targets work in framesets:
 
1. Open an existing frameset or create a new frameset.
 
 In Figure 8-6, you see that I’m using the Pink Flamingo Web site, which I 
created to use as an example in this chapter.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Use the 
Target 
field in the 
Property 
inspector 
to specify 
where a 
linked page 
will appear 
within a 
frameset.
 
 
2. Highlight the text or click to select the image you want to serve as the 
link.
 
 In my example, I selected the second thumbnail image in the left column. 
Note that the process of targeting a link works the same whether you’re 
creating a link with text or an image.
 
3. In the Property inspector, enter any URL in the Link text box or use 
the Browse button to select the page you want to link to.
 
 In my example, I used the Browse button to set a link to the file stalkers.
html (this page includes a larger version of the thumbnail picture that I’ve 
selected).

239
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
 
4. In the Target drop-down list in the Property inspector, choose the 
name of the frame that you want the link to open into.
 
 In my example, I selected the frame mainframe as the target. Choose 
the name that corresponds to the frame where you want your linked 
page to open. Notice that Dreamweaver conveniently lists all the frames 
you named in your document in the Target drop-down list, which I have 
open in Figure 8-6.
 
 The result is shown in Figure 8-7. When the frameset appears in a browser 
and a user clicks the second thumbnail of the photo that features more 
than a dozen flamingos in the left frame, the stalkers.html page with a 
larger version of that photo appears in the main frame area.
 
Figure 8-7: 
The 
selected link 
opens the 
page and 
targets the 
main frame 
area.
 
 
 You can’t test your links until you preview your work in a browser, and 
you have to save all your framed pages to ensure that your preview will 
work properly. To save all the pages in a frameset, choose File➪Save All.

240
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Comparing target options
You have many options when you target links in a frameset. As shown in the 
preceding section, “Setting links to a target frame,” you can specify that a 
linked page opens in another frame within your frameset. In addition, you can 
set linked pages to open in the same frame as the page with the link, to open 
a completely new page with no frames, and even to open a second browser 
window and display the page without affecting the original framed design. 
Table 8-1 provides a list of target options and what they mean. You can find 
all these options in the Target drop-down list in the Property inspector.
 
The Target drop-down list in the Property inspector is activated only when 
you select a linked image or section of text — a link must be in the Link field of 
the Property inspector before you can set a target.
Table 8-1 
Understanding Target Options
Target Name
What It Does
_blank
Opens the linked document into a new browser window 
or tab.
_parent
Opens the linked document into the parent file of the page 
that has the link. (The parent is the file, frame, or frameset 
that contains the frame with the link.)
_self
Opens the linked document in the same frame as the origi-
nal link, replacing the current content of the frame. This is 
the default option and usually doesn’t need to be specified.
_top
Opens the linked document into the outermost frameset, 
replacing the entire contents of the browser window.
Changing Frame Properties
When you get more sophisticated with frames, you may want to further refine 
your frames by changing properties, which enables you to turn off frame 
borders, change the frame or border colors, limit scrolling, and so on. To 
access these options in Dreamweaver, choose Window➪Frames, click inside 
the Frames panel in the area that corresponds to the frame that you want to 
change, and then use the Property inspector to access the options I describe 
in the following four sections. Figure 8-8 shows the Property inspector as it 
appears when you select a frameset in the Frames panel.

241
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
 
Figure 8-8: 
The 
selected 
frames or 
framesets 
and their 
properties 
are visible in 
the Property 
inspector.
 
Changing frame borders
The best thing you can do with a frame border is to turn it off. You can turn 
off the borders for your site by choosing No from the Borders drop-down list 
in the Property inspector for either the frameset or for any of the individual 
frames in the frameset. Your other options include Yes, which forces the 
borders to be visible, and Default, which usually means Yes. In the case of 
individual frames, however, the Default option inherits the settings from the 
parent frameset.
You can make global border settings by using the Property inspector and 
applying the settings to the frameset. To select the frameset so that its 
properties are visible in the inspector (refer to Figure 8-8), click the border 
that encloses the frameset in the Frames panel.
If you choose to keep your borders visible, you may want to customize the 
color by clicking the Border Color square in the Property inspector and then 
choosing a color from the color palette.
If you select a specific border, the Property inspector also enables you to 
specify the border width. Simply enter a value in pixels in the Border Width 
text field to change the width of the selected border.
 
Frame border colors aren’t well-supported by all browsers and may not 
display as you intend. Most designers simply turn off frame borders, but if 
you do keep them, make sure your design still looks okay if the borders are 
thick and grey, which is the default. Many browsers, including recent ones, 
don’t display a different border color.

242
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Changing frame sizes
The easiest way to change the size of a frame is to select the border and 
drag it until the frame is the size you want. When you select the border, the 
Property inspector displays the size of the frame, enabling you to change the 
size in pixels or as a percentage of the display area by entering a number in 
the Row or Column text boxes. If you specify 0 width for your frame borders, 
you may not see them on the page in order to drag and resize them. If this is 
the case, you can view the borders by choosing View➪Visual Aids➪Frame 
Borders, and Dreamweaver indicates the borders with a thin gray line that 
you can easily select.
Changing scrolling and resizing options
Scrolling options control whether a viewer can scroll up and down or left and 
right in a frame area. As shown in Figure 8-9, the scrolling options for frames 
are Yes, No, Auto, and Default. As a general rule, I recommend leaving the 
Scroll option set to Auto because a visitor’s browser can then turn on 
scrolling if necessary. That is, if the viewer’s display area is too small to see 
all the content of the frame, the frame becomes scrollable. If the content fits 
within the visible boundaries, the scroll arrows don’t appear.
 
Figure 8-9: 
The Scroll 
options 
list in the 
Property 
inspector.
 
If you set this option to Yes, the scroll arrows are visible whether they’re 
needed or not. If you set it to No, they won’t be visible, even if that means 
your viewer can’t see all the content of the frame — a sometimes dangerous 
proposition because then there’s no easy way to scroll. Default leaves it up to 
the browser. In most browsers, the Default option results in the same display 
as the Auto option, but Default yields unpredictable results. As a general rule, 
using Auto is best.
Also note the No Resize option in Figure 8-9. If you select this option, a visitor to 
your site can’t change the size of the frames. If you leave this option deselected, 
your user can select the border and drag it to make the frame area smaller 
or larger, just as you can when you develop your frames in Dreamweaver. 
Generally, I like to give viewers control, but I sometimes select the No Resize 
option if I want to ensure that my viewers can’t alter the design in their browser.

243
 Chapter 8: Framing Your Pages
Setting margin height and width
The Margin Width and Margin Height options enable you to specify the 
amount of margin space around a frame. Normally in a browser window, a 
small margin is visible between the edge of the window and any content, 
such as images or text. That’s why you can’t normally place an image on your 
page flush against the edge of the browser. With frames, though, you can 
actually control the size of the margin or even eliminate the margin.
I generally recommend that you set the margin to at least two pixels and make 
the margin larger if you want to create more space around your content. If you 
want to get rid of the margin, set it to 0 and any images or text in the frame 
appears flush against the edge of the frame or the browser window if the frame 
touches the edge of the browser. If the frame touches another frame, you can 
use this technique to create the impression of seamless images across frames.

S
trive for consistency in all your designs — except when you’re trying to 
be unpredictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web site 
lively. But, most Web sites work best and are easiest to navigate when they 
follow a consistent design theme. Case in point: Most readers take for granted 
that books don’t change their designs from page to page, and newspapers 
don’t change headline fonts and logos every day. Books and newspapers want 
to make life easier for their readers, and consistency is one of the primary 
tools for making sure readers find publications familiar. That doesn’t mean you 
should limit modern Web design to what’s possible in print, but it does mean 
we can all learn a thing or two from hundreds of years of print design.
Dreamweaver offers several features to help you develop and maintain a 
consistent look and feel across your site. In this chapter, you discover three 
of my favorite Dreamweaver features — templates, Library items, and the 
Tracing Image feature. Find out how they combine to make your design work 
faster and easier to manage, and you’ll be well on your way to simplifying 
your work even before you start. The most important feature covered in this 
chapter is the ability to create templates. Templates in Dreamweaver not 
only make it easy to create pages with consistent design elements, they make 
it easy to update those pages later when things change — and things always 
change.

246
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Templating Your Type
You can choose from many different kinds of templates to create Web 
sites; and you can find many places on the Web where you can buy them 
or even download them for free. At its simplest, a template is a ready-made 
page design, usually created in a way that makes it easy to add your own 
text and images. Some templates are customizable so that you can change 
design elements, such as colors, images, or fonts.
Dreamweaver takes this concept a few leaps further. Not only can you create 
templates that can be used to create new pages quickly and easily, you can 
also use Dreamweaver’s templates to make global changes to all the pages 
created from a template.
 
Templates are best used in the following scenarios:
 
 Templates are definitely the way to go when you’re creating a number 
of pages that share the same characteristics, such as the same back-
ground color, navigation elements, or logo. I recommend that you use 
a template any time you create a site with more than a few pages. For 
example, you might create a template that includes your logo, a row of 
links at the top and bottom of each page, and styles for the text colors 
and fonts. After you create a template with all these features, you can 
use it as the basis for all the other pages in your site. This approach 
makes it faster and easier to create a series of pages that share the same 
navigation, logo, and so on. If you ever decide to change one of these 
elements, such as your logo, you can change it once in the template and 
automatically update all the pages created from the template in your 
site.
 
 If you want to use different design elements in different sections, 
you can even create more than one template for a site. For example, if 
you’re creating a Web site for a bed-and-breakfast inn, you might create 
one template for all the pages where you want to show off the rooms in 
the inn and another for a collection of pages that features great places to 
hike in the area.
 
 When creating multiple templates for a Web site, you may benefit from a 
nested template, a template whose design and editable regions are based 
on another template. 
 
 For example, you can create a main template for elements that appear 
on every page across an entire site, such as a navigation bar. Then for 
secondary templates, start with the main template and add nested tem-
plates that have design variations for a section (or sections) of a site.

247
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
 Templates are valuable when you’re working with a team of people 
with varying skill levels. For example, say you’re building a site for a 
real-estate company and want to let the employees update the sales 
listings without messing up the page design. The fact that templates 
have locked regions can protect the most important elements of a page, 
making it easy for sales staff to add new information without acciden-
tally breaking navigation elements or other consistent features.
 
The most powerful aspect of Dreamweaver’s template feature is the capability 
to make global changes to every page created from a template. Even if you’re 
working alone on a site, this aspect of templates can save hours (or even 
days) of time as the site grows and changes over time.
Creating Templates
Creating a template is as easy as creating any other file in Dreamweaver. 
You can start by creating an HTML Template page much as you would any 
other page. You can also choose File➪Save As to turn any existing page 
into a template. The main difference is that the extension for a template 
file is .dwt (Dynamic Web Template), and template files are stored in a 
special Templates folder. When you create your first template in a Web 
site, Dreamweaver automatically creates a Templates folder in the root 
folder of your Web site and stores all your .dwt template files in this folder. 
Templates must be kept in this common Templates folder for the automated 
features in Dreamweaver to work properly.
 
The template features work only if you define your Web site in Dreamweaver. 
If you haven’t gone through the setup process to define your root site folder 
yet, see Chapter 2 and complete those set up steps first.
Creating editable and uneditable regions
Perhaps the most difficult concept to grasp when it comes to templates is 
how editable and uneditable regions work and why they’re important. Here’s 
the short answer (I get into the details later in this chapter).
When you create a template design, every aspect of the design is locked auto-
matically, or uneditable, until you designate it as an editable region — areas 
of a template that can be changed in any page created from the template. 
The steps for making a region editable are relatively simple (you find detailed 
instructions in the exercises that follow). When you create a new page from a 
template, only the areas you’ve designated as editable regions can be altered. 
If you want to make global changes with a template, only the areas that 
you’ve left uneditable can be used to make changes across multiple pages.

248
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
For example, suppose you create a design for an online magazine with the 
logo and navigation bar at the top of the page and the copyright and naviga-
tion links at the bottom, and you leave all these areas uneditable. Then you 
create a design area in the middle of the page where a story and photo can 
be added to each page created from the template and you designate that area 
as an editable region. When you create new pages from the template, you 
can replace the photo and story on each page because they’re in editable 
regions, but you can’t change the logo, navigation links, or copyright because 
they’re in uneditable regions.
Now imagine that you’ve used this template to create many pages that are 
exactly the same, except that each features a different story and photo in 
the middle area designated as the editable region. Then one day you decide 
to change the logo for your company, so you need to change that section of 
the page on all the pages you’ve created. If the logo is in an uneditable region 
of the template, no problem. You simply open the template file and edit the 
logo on that one page. When you save the template, the new logo is applied 
automatically to all the pages created from that template. That saves a ton 
of time because you don’t have to replace the logo on each page. You could 
make the same kinds of global changes to the navigation links at the top and 
bottom of the page because they’re also in uneditable regions.
In contrast, if you make changes to the editable region in the template, those 
changes aren’t applied to the pages created from the template. This is impor-
tant because you wouldn’t want to make a global change that overwrites all 
the individual stories and photos you’ve inserted into each page. It comes 
down to this: Locked areas of a template (areas you don’t designate as edit-
able) can be changed only in the template itself, and those changes can then 
be applied automatically to all the pages created from that template. Areas of 
a template designated as editable can be changed in any page created from 
the template, but those areas can’t be updated automatically by changing the 
template.
If you’re still a little confused after all this theory, don’t worry, you’ll get to 
see all this in action in the sections that follow.
Creating a new template
To create a template that you can use to create new pages, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens.
 
2. In the list on the left, click the Blank Template option, as shown in 
Figure 9-1.

249
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
Figure 9-1: 
The 
Templates 
panel 
displays a 
list of all 
available 
templates in 
the selected 
site and 
provides 
access to 
template 
editing 
functions. 
Why the head section is editable by default
In a new template, all elements are locked by 
default except for the document head section, 
which is indicated by the <head>, </head> 
tags. These tags enable you to change the title 
in any page created from a template or to insert 
JavaScript if you use behaviors on the page 
(covered in Chapter 10). For the template to be 
of much use for building new pages, you must 
make areas in the body of the page editable as 
well. Remember that you can always go back 
to the template later to alter the design, make 
more areas editable, or lock areas so they can’t 
be changed.
In previous versions of Dreamweaver, if you cre-
ated a template from an existing HTML page using 
the File➪Save As feature to save the file as a .dwt 
template file, the head section wasn’t turned into 
an editable region automatically. If you’re work-
ing with Dreamweaver CS4, you shouldn’t have 
this problem unless you are creating a template 
by saving a page that was created in previous 
version of Dreamweaver. If  there are no tem-
plate tags around the head section of  a page, you 
can’t edit the Title of the page and you can’t add 
features that use JavaScript, such as those cre-
ated with Dreamweaver’s Spry AJAX widgets or 
Behaviors. To solve this problem you can recreate 
the template from a new file in Dreamweaver CS4 
or you can manually add the template code to the 
head region of the existing file. Find instructions 
for adding the code manually on my Web site at 
www.DigitalFamily.com/dream
weaver.
 
3. In the Template Type list, choose HTML Template.
 
 You can also choose from a variety of other template options, including 
templates for ASP (Active Server Pages), ColdFusion, JSP (Java Server 
Pages), and PHP (a recursive acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor). 
These file types are used when creating dynamic Web sites. Find an 
introduction to creating dynamic Web sites in Chapters 14 and 15. In 
this example, I’m creating a new HTML page template.

250
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
4. In the Layout area, choose <none> to create a blank page or select any 
of the predesigned CSS layouts.
 
 Dreamweaver’s many CSS layout options provide a great headstart 
to creating a new page design. Instructions for how to customize 
Dreamweaver’s CSS layouts are included in Chapter 6.
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 A new blank template is created and opens in the main work area, and 
the New Document dialog box closes.
 
6. Choose File➪Save.
 
 If you haven’t disabled the dialog box, a warning appears stating that 
the template doesn’t have any editable regions and asking whether you 
really want to save it. Click Yes to continue.
 
7. Click OK to save the page as is for now.
 
 The Save as Template window appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
  
8. Give the template a name and a description, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
 The description field is optional but can be useful if you have many 
templates and want to keep notes about them. Note that the Save as 
Template dialog box includes a list of any templates that already exist in 
the site. The dialog box also includes a Site field at the top with a drop-
down list that includes all the sites you’ve defined in Dreamweaver. This 
makes it possible to save a template into any site you’ve defined when 
you created it.
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Save 
as Template 
window 
displays 
existing 
templates.
 
 
9. Click Save and the template is saved automatically with a .dwt 
extension.
 
 The .dwt extension designates the file as a Dreamweaver template. 
You can now edit this page as you edit any other HTML page, inserting 
images, text, and so on.

251
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
10. Choose Modify➪Page Properties and specify the page-wide settings.
 
 Use the Page Properties dialog box to specify background, text, and 
link colors, as well as other options that apply to the entire page. (Page 
properties options are covered in Chapter 2.)
 
 When you set page properties, Dreamweaver creates the corresponding 
CSS styles in the template file and displays them in the CSS panel. You 
find more information about CSS editing options in Chapters 5 and 6.
 
11. Create a design for the page by adding images, text, and other ele-
ments as you would in any other Dreamweaver file.
 
 You find instructions for adding all these features to your pages 
throughout this book. Again, remember, you create a page design in a 
template just like you would in any other Web page.
 
12. To create an editable region:
 
a. Select any image, text block, or content area, such as a <div> tag.
 
 If you choose to start with a blank page, type to enter some text 
and select it so that you can follow along with this exercise.
 
 Tip: If you’ve designed your pages with <div> tags and CSS, as cov-
ered in Chapter 6, a good option is to select the div for an entire sec-
tion. A handy way to do that is to use the tag selector at the bottom 
of the workspace to select the div, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: 
To select 
an entire 
section of a 
page, select 
the cor-
responding 
tag, such as 
a <div> tag, 
by using the 
tag selector 
at the 
bottom of 
the page. 

252
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
b. Choose Insert➪New Template Object➪New Editable Region (as 
shown in Figure 9-4).
 
 The New Editable Region dialog box opens.
 
Figure 9-4: 
You can 
select any 
element in 
a template 
page, such 
as an image, 
or any area, 
such as a 
<div> tag 
shown here, 
and make it 
an editable 
region.
 
 
13. When you finish designing the page, choose File➪Save to save your 
template.
 
 When you save a new template page or you save an existing page 
as a template, Dreamweaver automatically adds the .dwt extension 
and saves the file into a Templates folder. If you don’t already have a 
Templates folder in your local root folder, Dreamweaver creates one for 
you. (If Dreamweaver doesn’t automatically create a Template folder, 
make sure you create a new Templates folder and save all your template 
files inside it.) For templates to be listed in the New Document window, 
they must be saved in a Templates folder.
 
If you save a template in Dreamweaver before you specify any editable 
regions, you’re prompted with a warning because templates aren’t useful 
without editable regions. You don’t have to create editable regions before you 
save a template, but you can’t make any changes in any pages created from 
a template until you create one or more editable regions. You can always go 
back and add editable regions later, so it’s not a problem if you want to save 
your work before you create editable regions.

253
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
Saving any page as a template
Sometimes you get partway through creating a page before you realize that 
you’re likely to want more pages just like it and you should create a template 
so you don’t have to re-create the same page design over and over. Similarly, 
you may be working on a page that someone else created that you want to 
turn into a template. No matter where the original page comes from, creating 
a template from an existing page is almost as easy as creating a new template 
from scratch.
To save a page as a template, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page that you want to turn into a template.
 
 Choose File➪Open and browse to find your file. Or open the site in the 
Files panel and double-click the file to open it.
 
2. Choose File➪Save as Template, as shown in Figure 9-5.
 
 The Save as Template dialog box appears (refer to Figure 9-2).
 
Figure 9-5: 
You can 
save any 
HTML page 
as a 
template.
 

254
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
3. In the Site drop-down list, choose a site.
 
 The menu lists all the sites you’ve defined in Dreamweaver. By default, 
the site you’ve defined and opened in the Files panel is selected when the 
dialog box opens. If you’re working on a new site or haven’t yet defined 
your site, read Chapter 2 for information on defining the site.
 
 You can use the Save as Template option to save a page as a template 
into any defined site, which makes it easy to save a page design from 
one site as a template for another site.
 
4. In the Save As text box, type a name for the template.
 
5. Click the Save button.
 
 If you haven’t disabled the dialog box, a warning appears stating that 
the template doesn’t have any editable regions and asking whether you 
really want to save it. Click Yes to continue.
 
 Notice that the file now has the .dwt extension, indicating that it’s a 
template. You can now make changes to this template the same way you 
edit any other template.
 
6. Update links in the template.
 
 When you save a new template page or you save an existing page as 
a template, Dreamweaver automatically adds the .dwt extension and 
saves the file into a Templates folder. (If Dreamweaver doesn’t automati-
cally do this, make sure you create a new Templates folder and save all 
your template files inside the Templates folder in your root site folder.) 
Because your original file probably wasn’t saved in the Templates 
folder, any links to other pages or images must be updated when the file 
is saved. Click OK and Dreamweaver corrects any links in the file as it 
saves the file in the Templates folder.
 
7. Make any changes that you want and then choose File➪Save.
 
 You edit a template just as you edit any other page in Dreamweaver.
 
8. To create an editable region:
 
a. Select any content area, image, or text.
 
b. Choose Insert➪Template Object➪New Editable Region (as shown 
in Figure 9-4).
 
 The New Editable Region dialog box opens.
 
c. Give the new region a name.
 
 The region you define as editable becomes an area that can be 
changed in any page created from the template. You can create 
multiple editable regions in any template.

255
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
d. Click OK.
 
 The editable region is enclosed in a highlighted area with a tab at 
the top left, identified by the name you gave the region.
 
9. When you finish designing the page, choose File➪Save to save your 
completed template.
Making attributes editable
In addition to making any element in a page editable, you can also make the 
attributes of any element editable. This step is only necessary if you want to 
make an attribute editable when the tag itself is not editable. For example, 
when you want to make it possible to change the color attribute of an H1 
heading without making it possible to change the heading tag itself. To create 
editable attributes in a template, follow these steps:
 
1. In any Dreamweaver template, select an item that you want to make 
an editable attribute.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 9-6, I selected an image and am in the 
process of making one of the image attributes editable.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Select any 
heading, 
image, or 
other tag 
and use 
the Modify 
menu to 
make the 
attributes 
of that tag 
editable.
 

256
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
2. Choose Modify➪Templates➪Make Attribute Editable.
 
 The Editable Tag Attributes dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.
 
Figure 9-7: 
Identify 
which 
attributes 
you want to 
be editable.
 
 
3. From the Attribute drop-down list, choose the attribute you want to 
make editable.
 
 The attribute options vary depending on whether you select an image, 
text, or other element on the page.
 
 If the attribute isn’t listed, click the Add button. In this example, I 
selected the ALT attribute of the image tag.
 
4. Click OK to make the attribute editable and close the dialog box.
Creating a new page from a template
After you create a template, put it to use. You can use one template to create 
or modify all the pages in your Web site or create different templates for 
different sections. For example, in a site, such as my profile site at www.
JCWarner.com shown in these examples, you might create one template for 
each of the sections or use one template for all the pages in the site. After 
you create a template or a collection of templates, using a template to create 
a new page is similar to creating any other HTML page.
To use a template to create a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document window opens.
 
2. In the list on the left, click the Page from Template option, as shown 
in Figure 9-8.

257
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
3. In the Site list in the middle of the page, choose the name of the site 
that contains a template you want to use.
 
 The templates in the selected site appear in the Template for Site sec-
tion just to the right of the Site list in the New Document window (see 
Figure 9-8).
 
4. In the Template for Site list, select the template you want to use.
 
 Notice that when you click the name of a template, a preview of the 
selected template appears on the far right of the New Document 
window. In the example shown in Figure 9-8, I selected the main tem-
plate from the JCWarner site.
 
Figure 9-8: 
From 
the New 
Document 
window, 
you can 
preview and 
select any 
template 
saved in 
any defined 
Web site 
to create a 
new page.
 
 
5. Click the Create button.
 
 A new page is created from the template and appears in the main work 
area.
 
6. Edit any of the regions of the page that are editable with Dream- 
weaver’s regular editing features and save the file as you would save 
any other HTML page.
 
When you create new pages from a template, you can change only the editable 
regions in each file created from the template. When you edit a template, only 
the regions that aren’t defined as editable can be used to make global changes 
to all the pages created from the template.

258
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Making Global Changes with Templates
One of the greatest advantages of using templates is that you can automati-
cally apply changes to all the pages created with a template by altering the 
original template. For example, if I created a series of pages with the main 
template shown in the preceding example, I could make changes to those 
pages by editing any of the uneditable regions in the template.
To update files in a site that were created from a template, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the template file.
 
 Note that template files are distinguishable by the .dwt extension and 
are saved in the Template folder.
 
2. Use Dreamweaver’s editing features to make any changes you want to 
the template.
 
 Remember that only changes to uneditable regions are updated auto-
matically. In this example, the logo and navigation elements are locked 
regions and can be edited to make global changes.
 
3. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Update Template Files dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-9.
 
4. Click the Update button to modify all pages listed in the Update 
Template Files dialog box. Click the Don’t Update button to leave 
these pages unchanged.
 
 If you click Update, Dreamweaver automatically changes all the pages 
listed in the Update Template Files dialog box to reflect any changes 
made to uneditable regions of the template.
 
Figure 9-9: 
You can 
update all 
files created 
from a 
template.
 

259
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
Identifying a template
If you’re not sure which template was used to create a page, you can open 
the template while you have the page open, make changes to the template, 
and update all the pages created with it by following these steps:
 
1. Open a document that uses the template that you want to change.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Templates➪Open Attached Template, as shown in 
Figure 9-10.
 
 The template opens.
 
Figure 9-10: 
You can 
open an 
attached 
template 
from within 
any page 
created 
from a 
template. 
 
3. Use Dreamweaver’s regular editing functions to modify the template 
as you would edit any page or template.
 
4. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Update Template Files dialog box appears (refer to Figure 9-9).

260
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
5. Click the Update button to modify all the pages listed in the Update 
Template Files dialog box. Click the Don’t Update button to leave 
these pages unchanged.
 
 If you choose Update, Dreamweaver automatically changes all the pages 
listed in the Update Template Files dialog box.
 
If you have a page open that was created from the template, the changes will 
automatically be applied, but you’ll need to save the page before closing it to 
save the changes.
 
You can also apply changes to all the pages created from a template with the 
Update Pages option. To do so, open the template, and then make and save 
your changes without applying those changes to pages created with the tem-
plate. Anytime later, you can choose Modify➪Templates➪Update Pages to 
apply the update.
Attaching and detaching templates
You can apply a template to an existing page by attaching it, and you can 
remove a template from a page by detaching it. When you apply a template 
to an existing document, the content in the template is added to the con-
tent already in the document. If a template is already applied to the page, 
Dreamweaver automatically matches any editable regions that have the same 
name in both templates and opens a dialog box with a list of regions, includ-
ing any that don’t match. 
You can remove or detach a template from a page if you no longer want 
changes to the original template to affect the page created with the template. 
Detaching a template also unlocks all regions of a page, making it completely 
editable. You can detach a template by choosing Modify➪Templates➪Detach 
from Template. This action makes the file fully editable again, but any future 
changes you make to the template aren’t reflected on the detached page.
You can apply a template to an existing page by using any one of the follow-
ing techniques:
 
 Choose Modify➪Templates➪Apply Template to Page and then double-
click the name of a template to apply it to the page.
 
 Drag the template from the Template Assets panel into the Document 
window. To open the Template Assets panel, click the Assets tab behind 
the Files panel tab and then click the Templates icon. You can also 
choose Window➪Assets.
If the editable regions don’t match, Dreamweaver asks you to match incon-
sistent region names in a dialog box. After the region conflicts are resolved, 
click OK.

261
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
Reusing Elements with 
the Library Feature
The Library feature isn’t a common feature in other Web design programs, 
so the concept may be new to you even if you’ve been developing Web sites 
for a while. The Library feature is handy when you have a single element you 
want to reuse on many pages, such as a copyright statement you want to 
appear at the bottom of each page or even something as complex as a row of 
navigation links.
A Library item is a snippet of code that can contain almost anything, including 
image references and links. After you save a section of code in the Library, 
you can insert it into any page with drag-and-drop ease. If you ever need to 
change a Library item (by adding or changing a link, for example), simply edit 
the stored Library item and Dreamweaver automatically updates the con-
tents of the Library item on any or all pages where it appears throughout the 
site.
Like templates, Library items are a great way to share the work of your best 
designers with less experienced ones. For example, one designer can create 
a logo and another can create the navigation elements, and then these can be 
placed in the Library and made available to the entire team. You have more 
flexibility with Library items than templates because they’re elements you 
can place anywhere on any page, even multiple times. Libraries aren’t shared 
among sites the way templates are, but you can copy and paste the same 
Library item from one site into another.
 
Library items can’t contain their own style sheets because the code for styles 
can appear only as part of the head area of an HTML file. You can, however, 
attach an external style sheet to a Library item to see how the styles affect 
the display of the Library item, but the same styles must be available on each 
page where the Library item is used for the styles to be applied. (For more on 
style sheets, see Chapters 5 and 6.)
Creating and Using Library Items
The following sections show you the steps for creating a Library item, adding 
one to a page, and editing and updating a Library item across multiple pages. 
For these steps to work properly, you must do them in sequential order. 
Before creating or using Library items, you must first define a site and open 
it in the Files panel. (See Chapter 2 for instructions on defining a site in 
Dreamweaver.)

Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Creating a Library item within an existing page works well because you can 
see how the item looks before you add it to the Library. You can edit an 
item after it’s in the Library, but it may not look just as it will on a Web page. 
For example, Library items don’t include <body> tags when they’re saved 
in the Library, so link colors are displayed as default blue when viewed in 
the Library, even if the link colors have been changed to, say, purple in the 
<body> tag of the page.
Creating a Library item
To create a Library item that you can use on multiple pages on your site, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open any existing file that has images, text, or other elements on the 
page that you want to save as a Library item.
 
2. From this page, select an element or collection of elements that you 
want to save as a Library item, such as the copyright information that 
appears at the bottom of this page.
 
3. Choose Modify➪Library➪Add Object to Library.
 
 The Library Assets panel opens and displays any existing Library items. 
Your new Library item appears as Untitled.
 
4. Click to select Untitled and replace it by typing a new name as you 
would name any file in Explorer on a PC or the Finder on a Mac.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 9-11, I’ve named the Library item 
copyright.
 
 When you create a Library item, Dreamweaver automatically saves it to 
the Library. Naming Library items makes them easier to identify when you 
want to use them. You can then easily apply Library items to any new or 
existing page in your site by following the steps in the next exercise.

Library 
panel.

 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
Adding a Library item to a page
You can easily add elements from the Library to your pages by simply drag-
ging them from the Assets panel to the page. When you add a Library item to 
a page, the content is inserted into the document and a relationship is estab-
lished between the content on the page and the item in the Library. This is 
important because it enables you to edit the Library item later and apply the 
changes to all pages where the item appears, but it also means that you can’t 
edit the item on the page where it’s inserted. You must edit Library items 
from within the Library, as you see in the following section.
To add a Library item to a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new document in Dreamweaver or open any existing file.
 
2. From the Files panel, click the Assets tab, and then click the Library 
icon.
 
 The Library opens in the Assets panel (refer to Figure 9-11).
 
3. Drag an item from the Library to the Document window.
 
 Alternatively, you can select an item in the Library and click the Insert 
button. The item automatically appears on the page. After you insert a 
Library item on a page, you can use any of Dreamweaver’s formatting 
features to position it on the page.
Highlighting Library items
Library items are highlighted to distinguish them from other elements on a 
page. You can both customize the highlight color for Library items and show 
or hide the highlight color in the Preferences dialog box. To change or hide 
Library highlighting, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences 
(Mac).
 
 The Preferences dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Category section on the left, select Highlighting.
 
3. Click the color box to select a color for Library items and then select 
the Show box to display the Library highlight color on your pages.
 
 Leave the box blank if you don’t want to display the highlight color.
 
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.

264
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
Making global changes with Library items
One of the biggest timesaving advantages of the Dreamweaver Library feature 
is that you can make changes to Library items and automatically apply those 
changes to any or all pages where the Library item appears. To edit a Library 
item, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Files panel, click the Assets tab and then click the Library 
icon.
 
 The Library opens in the Assets panel (refer to Figure 9-11).
 
2. Double-click any item listed in the Library to open it.
 
 Dreamweaver opens a new window where you can edit the Library item.
 
 Because the Library item is just a snippet of code, it won’t have a 
<body> tag in which to specify background, link, or text colors. Don’t 
worry about this — the Library item acquires the right settings from the 
tags on the page where you insert it.
 
3. Change the Library item as you would edit any element in 
Dreamweaver.
 
 For example, you can change a link, edit the wording of text, change 
the font or size, and even add images, text, and other elements. In this 
example, I changed the date for the copyright from 2008 to 2009.
 
4. Choose File➪Save to save changes to the original item.
 
 The Update Library Items dialog box opens, displaying a list of all the 
pages where the Library item appears.
 
5. To apply the changes you made to the Library item on all the listed 
pages, click the Update button. If you don’t want to apply the changes 
to all the pages where the Library item appears, click the Don’t Update 
button.
 
 If you clicked the Update button, the Update Pages dialog box appears 
and shows the progress of the updating. You can stop the update from 
this dialog box, if necessary.
If you want to create a new Library item based on an existing one with-
out altering the original, follow Steps 1–3, and in place of Step 4, choose 
File➪Save As and give the item a new name.
Editing one instance of a Library item
If you want to alter a Library item on a specific page where you’ve inserted 
it, or if you want to make changes to just a few pages, you can override the 
automated Library feature by detaching it, or breaking the link between the 
original item in the Library and the item inserted into the page.

265
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
After you break a connection, you can no longer update that page’s Library 
item automatically.
To make a Library item editable, follow these steps:
 
1. Open any file that contains a Library item and select the Library item.
 
 The Property inspector displays the Library item options, as shown in 
Figure 9-12.
 
Figure 9-12: 
You can 
detach 
a Library 
item in the 
Property 
inspector. 
 
2. Click the Detach from Original button.
 
 A warning message appears, letting you know that if you proceed with 
detaching the Library item from the original, you can no longer update 
this occurrence of it when the original is edited.
 
3. Click OK to detach the Library item.
Using a Tracing Image 
to Guide Your Layout
The Tracing Image feature is especially popular among designers. The con-
cept dates back to the earliest days of design. The Tracing Image feature 
enables you to use graphics as guides for your page designs, much as you 
might copy a cartoon through thin transparent paper.
The Tracing Image feature is ideal for people who like to first create a design 
in a program, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, and then model their Web 
page after it. By using the Tracing Image feature, you can insert any Web-
ready image into the background of any Dreamweaver page. Then you can 
position <div> tags or insert tables or other elements on top of the tracing 
image, making it easier to re-create your design in Dreamweaver. You can use 
JPG, GIF, or PNG images as tracing images and you can create them in any 
graphics application that supports these formats.

266
Part II: Appreciating Web Design Options 
 
Although the tracing image appears in the background of a page, it doesn’t 
take the place of a background image and won’t appear in a browser.
To add a tracing image to your page, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new page or open an existing page in Dreamweaver.
 
2. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
 
 The Page Properties dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Category list, select Tracing Image.
 
 The Tracing Image options appear on the right, as shown in Figure 9-13.
 
Figure 9-13: 
The Page 
Properties 
dialog box 
lets you set 
a tracing 
image to 
use when 
laying out 
your HTML 
page.
 
 
4. Click the Browse button to locate the image you want to use as a trac-
ing image.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
 
5. Click the image you want to trace from and then click Apply to pre-
view how the image looks behind the page.

267
 Chapter 9: Coordinating Your Design Work
 
6. Set the opacity for the tracing image with the Transparency slider.
 
 Lowering the transparency level causes the tracing image to appear 
faded, which makes distinguishing between the tracing image and con-
tent on the page easy. You can set the transparency level to suit your 
preferences, but somewhere around 50 percent works well with most 
images.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 The tracing image appears in the Document window and the dialog box 
closes.
You have a few other options with the Tracing Image feature. Choose 
View➪Tracing Image to reveal the following options:
 
 Show: Hides the tracing image if you want to check your work without it 
being visible but don’t want to remove it.
 
 Align with Selection: Enables you to automatically line up the tracing 
image with a selected element on a page.
 
 Adjust Position: Enables you to use the arrow keys or enter X, Y coordi-
nates to control the position of the tracing image behind the page.
 
 Reset Position: Resets the tracing image to 0, 0 on the X, Y coordinates.
 
 Load: Enables you to add or replace a tracing image.
After you have the tracing image in place, you can use it as a guide while you 
design your page. Because the tracing image is behind the page, it won’t inter-
fere with your design work, and you can add any elements over the tracing 
image that you could add to any other Web page. Use the tracing image as a 
reference as you insert and position <div> tags, images, and other elements.

reamweaver’s behaviors make it possible to use 
JavaScript to create interactive features, such as 
rollover images and pop-up windows. The multimedia 
options help your Web pages sing, dance, and delight. In 
Chapter 10, you find an introduction to the Behaviors 
panel and step-by-step instructions for creating rollovers, 
image swaps, and more. You also find instructions for 
using the Dreamweaver Spry menu to create advanced 
AJAX features, such as drop-down menus and collapsible 
panels. In Chapter 11, you find out how to add multimedia 
files, such as sound, video, and Flash animations, to your 
Web pages. In Chapter 12, you discover that Dreamweaver

ant to add cool effects like rollovers and pop-up windows? 
Dreamweaver’s behaviors make it easier than ever to create these 
kinds of interactive features with a JavaScript scripting language.
Behaviors are ready-to-use scripts that can be customized to create a variety of 
features. You can apply behaviors to almost any element on an HTML page and 
even to the entire page itself. For example, you can use the Swap Image feature 
to create an interactive slide show or the Open Browser Window option to play 
a video in a small, separate browser window.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Behaviors panel and show you how to 
use some of Dreamweaver’s most popular options.
Brushing Up on Behavior Basics
When you start working with behaviors in Dreamweaver, you can get up and 
running more easily if you start with this basic introduction to how they work 
and the terminology they use. When you set up a behavior, you can choose from 
a number of triggers, or events, such as OnMouseOver or OnClick. Consider this 
slightly corny example: If you tickle someone and make the person laugh, you 
used an event to trigger an action. Dreamweaver would call the tickling the event 
and the laughter the action. The combination is a Dreamweaver behavior.

272
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
You may already be familiar with the rollover behavior, when one image is 
switched for another. In a rollover, putting your mouse over an image is the 
event. The action is the switching of the original image for another image, as 
shown in Figure 10-1. Rollovers are common in navigation. You can create 
rollovers with simple effects that use two images, as long as the images are 
exactly the same size. Alternatively, you can use the Swap Image behavior to 
create much more complex effects, such as causing any or all the images on a 
page to change when any other element is triggered.

When a 
cursor rolls 
over one of 
the images 
on this 
page, a

its place.

Dreamweaver includes about 20 behaviors, and you can download and install 
more. (You find instructions in the “Installing New Extensions for Behaviors” 
section, at the end of this chapter.)

273
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
Specifying the target browser for behaviors
In addition to the behaviors loaded on your 
computer, the number of behaviors available in 
the Behaviors panel is controlled by the Show 
Events For setting, which enables you to see 
only those behaviors that will work in the target 
browser for your site. To access these options, 
follow these steps:
 1. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the 
Behaviors panel.
 2. Click the small arrow just under the 
plus sign and select Show Events For 
(second from the last at the bottom of the 
drop-down list).
 3. Select the HTML level or browser versions 
you want to target.
 
 In the example shown in the figure, I chose 
IE 6. The higher the browser version you 
select, the more behaviors are available. 
When you specify a target browser, you 
limit the behaviors to only those that will 
work in the selected browser and later 
versions. Behaviors that aren’t supported 
by that browser version are dimmed and 
unavailable. Note: Behaviors may also 
be dimmed if they aren’t available for a 
selected element.
Check out Chapter 1 for more on browser 
differences and selecting a target browser.

Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
Creating a Rollover Image
Rollover images, as the name implies, are designed to react when someone 
rolls a cursor over an image. The effect can be as dramatic as a picture of a 
dog being replaced by a picture of a lion, or as subtle as the color of a word 
changing as one image replaces another. Either way, this is one of the most 
common JavaScripts in use on the Web and it’s such a popular feature that 
Dreamweaver includes a special dialog box just for rollovers.
In the section that follows, you find instructions for using the Behaviors panel, 
where Dreamweaver stores most of the Behaviors included in the program. In this 
section, you find instructions for using the Insert Rollover Image dialog box, which 
makes creating a simple rollover effect one of the easiest behaviors to apply.
 
You can create more complex rollover image effects, with the Swap Image 
option from the Behaviors panel, which makes it possible to change multiple 
images at the same time, as you see in the following section.
To create a simple rollover effect with Dreamweaver’s Insert Image Rollover 
dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Place your cursor on the page where you want the rollover to appear.
 
 Rollover effects require at least two images: one for the initial state and 
one for the rollover state. You can use two different images or two similar 
ones, but both should have the same dimensions. Otherwise, you get some 
strange scaling effects because both images must be displayed in exactly 
the same space on the page.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the drop-down list available from the images 
icon in the Insert panel and select Rollover Image.
 
 The Insert Rollover Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-2.
 
3. In the Image Name box, name your image.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Select the 
original and 
rollover 
images.
 

275
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
 Before you can apply a behavior to an element, such as an image, the 
element must have a name so that the behavior script can reference 
it. You can name elements anything you like as long as you don’t use 
spaces or special characters.
 
4. In the Original Image box, specify the first image you want visible. 
Use the Browse button to locate and select the image.
 
 If the images aren’t already in your site’s root folder, Dreamweaver 
copies them into your site when you create the rollover. (If you haven’t 
already defined your site in Dreamweaver, see Chapter 2 for more on 
this important preliminary step.)
 
5. In the Rollover Image box, enter the image you want to become 
visible when visitors move their cursors over the first image.
 
 Again, you can use the Browse button to locate and select the image.
 
6. Select the Preload Rollover Image check box to load all rollover 
images into the browser’s cache when the page first loads.
 
 If you don’t choose to do this step, your visitors may experience a delay 
because the second image won’t be downloaded until a mouse is rolled 
over the original image.
 
7. In the When Clicked, Go to URL box, enter any Web address or 
browse to locate another page in your site that you want to link to.
 
 If you don’t specify a URL, Dreamweaver automatically inserts the # sign 
as a placeholder in the code.
 
 The # sign is a common technique for creating links that don’t link 
anywhere. Because there are many great uses for rollover images that 
don’t link to another page, this is a useful technique. Just remember 
that if you do want your rollover to link, you need to replace the # sign 
with a link to another page.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The images are set up automatically as a rollover.
 
 
9. Click the globe icon at the top of the workspace to preview your work 
in a browser where you can test how the rollover works.
Adding Behaviors to a Web Page
Dreamweaver offers a number of behaviors you can choose from, including 
the Swap Image behavior and the Open New Browser Window behavior cov-
ered in detail in the next two sections. The process of adding other behaviors 
is similar to these two, but each behavior has its quirks. The tips and tricks 
you find here can help you get started with behaviors, find out where the 
majority of Behaviors features are in the program, and how you match behav-
iors with triggers using the Behaviors panel.

276
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
Creating swaps with multiple images
Before you start creating a more complex page design with Dreamweaver’s 
Swap Image behavior, first take a look at the finished page so you can see the 
result before you get into the details. Notice in Figure 10-3 that a collection of 
thumbnail images is on the right side of the page and a larger version of one 
of those images is displayed on the left side in the main area of the page.
 
Figure 10-3: 
When you 
use the 
Swap Image 
behavior, 
you can 
replace any 
or all the 
images on a 
page. 
Pointer
Notice in Figure 10-4 that when the page is displayed in a browser and I roll 
my cursor over another of the thumbnail images on the right, the larger 
image displayed on the left changes. With the Swap Image behavior, you can 
replace any or all the images on a page.
Follow these steps to use the Swap Image behavior:
 
1. Create a page design with all the images you want displayed initially.
 
 In the page design I created for these photos from India, the initial page 
design includes all thumbnail images positioned on the right, and the 
first of the big images displayed in the area on the left.

277
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
Figure 10-4: 
When you 
preview a 
behavior in 
a browser, 
you can 
see the 
effect of the 
Swap Image 
behavior 
when the 
cursor is 
rolled over 
an image.
 
Pointer
 
 You can use the Swap Image behavior to change images on any Web 
page no matter how the layout is created. In the design featured in this 
lesson, I used CSS to create a layout with separate <div> tags for each 
row of thumbnails on the right and another div tag for the bigger image 
on the left. These divs are positioned with CSS. (Find instructions for 
creating CSS layouts in Chapter 6.)
 
2. Name your images in the Property inspector.
 
 To target your images with JavaScript, which is how behaviors work, first 
give each image a unique ID. The image ID isn’t the same as the image 
filename, although you can use the same or similar names. In this example, 
I gave each thumbnail image an ID of a letter, identifying the thumbnails in 
alphabetical order according to how I want them positioned. Thus, image 
a is the first image in the top-left row, image b is in the top right, and so on. 
You can name images anything you like as long as you don’t use spaces 
or special characters. I find it helpful to use names that correspond to the 
image or its order. Using the same or similar IDs for your images as you use 
for the image filenames helps make it easier to match them when you create 
the behavior. For example, the filename for the thumbnail in the top-left row 
is a_bridge.jpg, and I gave the same image the ID of a, as shown in Figure 
10-5. Each of the other thumbnails is similarly named and identified to make 
it easy to match them as I create the Swap Image effects.

278
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 In contrast, I’ll replace the main image on the page with images that cor-
respond to each of the thumbnails. I’ll begin by inserting the main image 
of the boy getting his face painted, which I want to appear when the 
page is first loaded. I’ll be replacing this image each time I set up a Swap 
Image for one of the thumbnails. Thus, naming this main image some-
thing simple and distinctive, such as display_photo or main_photo, 
makes it easier to keep track of which image I’m replacing each time.
 
 Although Dreamweaver automatically assigns a name to each image you 
insert into a Web page, I find it easier to keep track when I set up the 
Swap Image behavior if I use names that describe the images or corre-
spond to their order.
 
3. Choose Window➪Behaviors.
 
 The Behaviors panel opens. You can drag the Behavior panel elsewhere 
on the page, and you can expand it by dragging its bottom or side. You 
may also want to close any other open panels to make more room by 
clicking on the dark gray bar at the top of any panel.
 
4. Select an image and choose the Swap Image behavior.
 
 First click to select the image in the page that will serve as the trigger for 
the action. In this example, I’m using the thumbnail images as triggers, 
so I select them one at a time, starting with the a_bridge.jpg thumb-
nail. With the trigger image selected in the workspace, click the Add 
Behavior arrow in the Behaviors panel (the small arrow under the plus 
sign) to open the drop-down list of actions and then select the action 
you want to apply. In the example shown in Figure 10-6, I selected the 
Swap Image action, which opens the Swap Image dialog box.
Peeking at the JavaScript code
JavaScript is the code behind Dreamweaver 
behaviors. Writing JavaScript is more complex 
than writing HTML code, but not as difficult as 
writing in a programming language, such as 
C# or Java. (No, Java and JavaScript aren’t 
the same.) Dreamweaver takes most of the 
challenge out of JavaScript by giving you a 
graphic interface that doesn’t require you to 
write the complicated code yourself. When you 
use behaviors, Dreamweaver automatically 
writes the code for you behind the scenes.
To fully appreciate what Dreamweaver can 
do for you, you may want to switch to code 
view after setting up a behavior just to see the 
complex code required when you use 
JavaScript. If you don’t like what you see, 
don’t worry: Go back to design view and you 
can continue to let Dreamweaver take care of 
the code for you. (I just want you to see how 
lucky you are that Dreamweaver includes these 
features.)

5. Specify the images to swap.
 
a. In the Swap Image dialog box, select the ID for the image that 
will be replaced. 
 
 In Figure 10-7, I selected the image with the ID display-photo.
 
b. Use the Browse button to select the image that will replace 
display-photo. 
 
 I selected the a_bridge.jpg image, which I carefully named to 
correspond to the matching thumbnail. Now when a user rolls 
a cursor over the a_bridge thumbnail image, the photo of 
the boy with the ID display_photo will be replaced with the 
bigger version of the a_bridge image.
 
Figure 10-7: 
Use the 
Browse 
button to 
select the 
image you 
want to 
swap.
 
 
6. At the bottom of the Swap Image dialog box, select Preload Images to 
instruct the browser to load all the images into the cache when the 
page is loaded.
 
 If you don’t select this option, there may be a delay when the image 
swap is used.
 
7. Deselect the Restore Images OnMouseOut option if you wish.
 
 The Restore Images OnMouseOut option means that when an event is 
completed (such as the mouse is moved off the triggering thumbnail), 
the original image is replaced. By default, Dreamweaver preselects this 
option for the Swap Image behavior, but in the example shown here, I 
deselect it because I found that replacing the original image each time I 
rolled the cursor over another thumbnail was distracting.
 
8. After you specify all the settings for the behavior, click OK.
 
 The new behavior appears in the Behaviors panel.
 
9. Specify an event for the behavior.

281
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
 After the action is applied, you can go back and specify which event will 
trigger the action (as shown in Figure 10-8). By default, Dreamweaver 
applies the OnMouseOver event when you use the Swap Image action, 
but you can change that to any available event, such as OnClick, which 
requires that the user click the image to trigger the Swap Image action. 
In this example, I leave it set to OnMouseOver. 
 
 The list of Behaviors and Events varies depending on the element selected, 
the applied behavior, and the target browsers specified in the program. For 
more information about events and what each one accomplishes, see the 
“Choosing an event for a behavior” section, later in this chapter. For more 
on browser differences, see the sidebar “Specifying the target browser for 
behaviors.”
 
Figure 10-8: 
When you 
set up a 
behavior, 
you can 
specify any 
available 
action to 
trigger an 
event. 
 
 You can display or hide events by clicking the Show All Events icon in the 
top left of the Behaviors panel. Note that if you’re using Windows, you 
also see a collection of events that begin with an <A> and are for elements 
that are linked.
 
10. Apply additional behaviors.
 
 To apply the Swap Image behavior to other images on a page, repeat 
Steps 5–7, clicking to select the image you want to serve as a trigger and 
then specifying the corresponding image that should be swapped. In this 
example, I selected each of the thumbnails in turn and set up a Swap Image 
behavior that replaced the display_photo image with the corresponding 
larger version of the image in the thumbnail.

282
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 For best display, make sure that the images that are swapped, such as 
the large photos shown in the main display area of this site, are all the 
same size.
 
11. Test your work in a browser.
 
 You can’t see the effects of behaviors like this one until you click on 
the Live View button at the top of the workspace in Dreamweaver or 
preview your page in a browser, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer. (If 
you want to see this example in action, visit Jasper Johal’s photo site at 
www.EastIndia.com.)
Using the Open Browser Window behavior
You can use behaviors in Dreamweaver to create many interactive features, 
such as opening a new browser window when someone clicks a link. As you 
can see in Figure 10-9, this is a great way to make supplemental information 
available without losing the original page a visitor was viewing. The Open 
Browser Window behavior enables you to specify the size of the new window 
and to display it over the existing window.
Choosing an event for a behavior
Events, in interactive Web-speak, are things a 
user does to trigger a behavior or an action in 
a Web page. Clicking an image is an event, as 
is loading a page into a browser, or pressing a 
key on the keyboard. Different browser versions 
support different events (the more recent the 
browser, the more events are available). Some 
events are available only for certain kinds of 
objects or behaviors. If an event can’t be used 
with a selected element or behavior, it appears 
dimmed. This list describes the most common 
events:
  onAbort: Triggered when the user stops 
the browser from completely loading an 
image (for example, when a user clicks the 
browser’s Stop button while an image is 
loading).
  onBlur: Triggered when the specified 
element stops being the focus of user 
interaction. For example, when a user 
clicks outside a text field after clicking in 
the text field, the browser generates an 
onBlur event for the text field. onBlur 
is the opposite of onFocus.
  onChange: Triggered when the user 
changes a value on the page, such as 
choosing an option from a pop-up list, or 
when the user changes the value of a text 
field and then clicks elsewhere on the 
page.
  onClick: Triggered when the user clicks 
an element, such as a link, a button, or an 
image.
  onDblClick: Triggered when the user 
double-clicks the specified element.
  onError: Triggered when a browser 
error occurs while a page or an image is 

283
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
To add the Open Browser Window behavior to a selected image (or any other 
element) on a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Create the page that will open in the new browser window.
 
 For this example, I created a new blank HTML page and inserted a larger 
version of the image that corresponds to the thumbnail I’ll be using as a 
trigger. The goal is that when a user clicks the trigger image, a browser 
window will open that is sized exactly to fit the larger image but much 
smaller than the full browser window.
loading. This event can be caused, for 
example, when an image or a URL can’t be 
found on the server.
  onFocus: Triggered when the specified 
element becomes the focus of user 
interaction. For example, clicking in or 
tabbing to a text field of a form generates 
an onFocus event.
  onKeyDown: Triggered as soon as the 
user presses any key on the keyboard. (The 
user doesn’t have to release the key for this 
event to be generated.)
  onKeyPress: Triggered when the user 
presses and releases any key on the 
keyboard. This event is like a combination of 
the onKeyDown and onKeyUp events.
  onKeyUp: Triggered when the user 
releases a key on the keyboard after 
pressing it.
  onLoad: Triggered when an image or the 
entire page finishes loading.
  onMouseDown: Triggered when the 
user presses the mouse button. (The user 
doesn’t have to release the mouse button 
to generate this event.)
  onMouseMove: Triggered when the user 
moves the mouse while pointing to the 
specified element and the pointer doesn’t 
move away from the element (stays within 
its boundaries).
  onMouseOut: Triggered when the pointer 
moves off the specified element (usually a 
link).
  onMouseOver: Triggered when the 
mouse pointer moves over the specified 
element. Opposite of onMouseOut.
  onMouseUp: Triggered when a mouse 
button that’s been pressed is released.
  onMove: Triggered when a window or 
frame is moved.
  onReset: Triggered when a form is reset 
to its default values, usually by clicking the 
Reset button.
  onResize: Triggered when the user 
resizes the browser window or a frame.
  onScroll: Triggered when the user 
scrolls up or down in the browser.
  onSelect: Triggered when the user 
selects text in a text field by highlighting it 
with the cursor.
  onSubmit: Triggered when the user 
submits a form, usually by clicking the 
Submit button.
  onUnload: Triggered when the user 
leaves the page, either by clicking to 
another page or by closing the browser 
window.

 When you name files that will be used in behaviors, such as a page that 
will open when the Open Browser Window behavior is used, avoid using 
slashes anywhere in a filename or numbers at the beginning of a filename 
(you can use numbers anywhere else in the name). You can use hyphens 
and underscores.
 
2. Select the image, text, or other element you want to serve as the trigger 
for the action.
 
 You can select any image, text, or layer on a page and apply a behavior 
to it the same way.
 
3. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
 
4. Click the plus sign (+) and choose the behavior you want from the 
drop-down list.
 
 In this example, I selected the Open Browser Window behavior.
 
 If a behavior appears dimmed, it can’t be associated with the selected 
element. For example, the Swap Image behavior can be applied only to an 
image, so it appears dimmed if you’ve selected text or another element.
 
5. In the Open Browser Window dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-10, 
specify the settings.
 
 You can set a number of options that control how the new browser 
window appears:

285
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
 
• Use the Browse button to the right of the URL to Display box to 
select the page you want to open in the new browser window. 
(You can also enter a URL in this box to open a page in another 
Web site.)
 
• Set the window width and height to specify the size of the new 
browser window that will open. In this example, I set the width to 
the exact size of the image and made the height 20 pixels larger to 
provide a little breathing room under the painting name.
 
• Select the options Navigation Toolbar, Location Toolbar, Status 
Bar, Menu Bar, Scrollbars as Needed, or Resize Handles if you 
want the new browser window to include any of these features. I 
selected Scrollbars as Needed in case my visitor’s browser window 
is smaller than the size I specified for the photo, but I left all the 
others deselected because I want a clean, simple browser window 
without any menus or other features.
 
• Name the new window, which is important if you want to target 
that same window to load other pages into it.
 
Figure 10-10:

settings for

of the 
window.
 
 
6. After you specify all the settings for the behavior, click OK.
 
 The new behavior appears in the Behaviors panel.
 
7. To change the event that triggers your behavior, select the current 
event from the left side of the Behaviors panel.
 
 In the Events drop-down list, select any available event to serve as the 
trigger for the behavior. For more information about events and what 
each one accomplishes, see the “Choosing an event for a behavior” 
section, later in this chapter.
 
8. To test the action, choose File➪Preview in Browser.
 
 Click the image to test whether a new browser window opens.

286
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
Attaching Multiple Behaviors
You can attach multiple behaviors to the same element on a page (as long as they 
don’t conflict, of course). For example, you can attach one action that’s triggered 
when users click an image and another when they move their cursors over the 
image. You can also trigger the same action by using multiple events. For example, 
you can play the same sound when a user triggers any number of events.
To attach additional behaviors to an element, click the plus sign in the 
Behaviors panel and select another option from the pop-up list. Repeat this 
process as many times as you want.
Editing a Behavior
You can always go back and edit a behavior after you create it. You can choose 
a different event to trigger the behavior, choose a different action, or remove 
behaviors. You can also change behavior options after a behavior is applied.
To edit a behavior, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an object with a behavior attached.
 
2. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
 
 Here are some options you can choose in the Behaviors panel:
 
• Change a triggering event: Choose a different event in the Events 
drop-down list in the Behaviors panel.
 
• Remove a behavior: Click the action in the Behaviors panel to 
select it and then click the minus sign at the top of the pane. The 
behavior disappears.
 
• Change parameters for an action: Double-click the gear icon next to 
the action and change the parameters in the dialog box that opens.
 
• Change the order of actions when multiple actions are set: Select 
an action and then click the Move Event Value Up or Move Event 
Value Down buttons to move the action to a different position in 
the list of actions.
Installing New Extensions for Behaviors
Even with all the cool features in Dreamweaver, a day will almost certainly 
come when you’ll want to do things that Dreamweaver can’t do with the 
features that shipped with the program. Fortunately, the programmers who 

287
 Chapter 10: Adding Interactivity with Behaviors
created Dreamweaver made it possible for other programmers to add 
features with the Extension Manager. The result? You can add new 
functionality by adding extensions from a variety of third-party sources.
You can find extensions that do everything from adding highly customizable 
drop-down and fly-out menus to full-featured shopping cart systems. Keep in 
mind, however, that not all extensions are well supported and few come with 
good instructions. They’re not all free, either. Some cost hundreds of dollars, 
but most are in the $20–$50 range. When you visit the Dreamweaver Exchange 
site, you find reviews and rankings to help you sort through the best options.
In the following steps, I explain how you find, download, and install a free 
Dreamweaver extension. Although how extensions work after they’re 
installed can differ dramatically, the basic process of adding them to 
Dreamweaver is nearly the same.
 
1. Visit the Dreamweaver Exchange site.
 
 Get to the Dreamweaver Exchange site by
 
• Choosing Get More Behaviors from the bottom of the Behaviors 
drop-down list in the Behaviors panel.
 
• Visiting www.adobe.com/exchange and following the link to the 
Dreamweaver section.
 
• Clicking the link in the bottom right of the Dreamweaver Welcome 
screen.
 
 Note: If you launch Dreamweaver and find a link to download an update 
for Dreamweaver instead of the link to the Exchange site, by all means 
download and install the update first. After you’re finished, the update 
link is replaced by the link to the Exchange site.
 
2. Sort through the many available extensions.
 
 You’ll find a wide range of extensions on the Dreamweaver Exchange 
site. You can search through extensions by category, keyword, and 
ranking options. Many of the extensions featured on the Exchange site 
include links to their creators’ sites, where you’ll often find even more 
extensions.
 
3. Select an extension and review its features.
 
 When you click a link to an extension on the Exchange site, you’ll find more 
information about the extension, including system requirements and the 
version of Dreamweaver that the extension was designed for. In general, 
you can use extensions designed for earlier versions of Dreamweaver in 
more recent versions. Be aware, however, that extensions designed for later 
versions of Dreamweaver usually won’t work in earlier versions of the 
program.
 
 Before you leave the extension’s page, I highly recommend that you take 
the time to read the special instructions in the middle of the page.

288
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 Some extensions include important instructions, such as where you’ll 
find the new feature in the Dreamweaver interface after it’s installed and 
warnings that some of the functionality of an extension will work only 
when previewed on a live Web server (this is true for the random image 
extension, for example).
 
4. To download an extension, click the Download button (for free 
extensions) or the Buy button next to the extension name and save 
the extension to your hard drive.
 
5. Install the new extension after it’s downloaded by choosing 
Help➪Manage Extensions to open the installation dialog box.
 
 Most extensions require that you close Dreamweaver before installation, 
and most install with the click of a button. Dreamweaver’s Extension 
Manager launches automatically to install most extensions.
 
6. In the Extension Manager dialog box, choose File➪Install Extension and 
then browse your drive to select the extension file you downloaded.
 
 After the installation is complete, Dreamweaver displays instructions 
for using the extension. These are usually the same as the instructions 
included in the middle of the page on the Exchange site.
 
 Pay special attention to the part of the instructions that tells you where 
you’ll find your newly installed extensions. Extensions may be added 
to menus, dialog boxes, and other parts of Dreamweaver depending on 
their functionality and how the programmer set them up, and it can be 
hard to find them if you don’t know where to look.
 
7. Launch Dreamweaver and find the new menu option, button, or other 
interface feature that controls your new extension.
 
 In many cases, all you have to do is open an existing page or create a 
new page in Dreamweaver and then open the newly added dialog box or 
select the new option from a menu.
 
Adobe is constantly updating the Exchange site available by clicking on the 
Dreamweaver link at www.adobe.com/exchange. Visit it regularly to find new 
extensions you can download and install to enhance Dreamweaver’s feature set.

et your Web pages singing and dancing with multimedia. Audio, video, 
and animation are exploding on the Web and transforming static 
pages into rich multimedia experiences. You can use Dreamweaver to link 
to multimedia files, or you can insert audio, video, and other files so that 
they play within your pages. You can even control when and how they play 
for your users.
Not all Web sites warrant multimedia; if your goal is to provide information 
in the fastest way possible to the broadest audience, text is still generally 
the best option. If you want to provide a richer experience for your users, 
to show rather than just tell, or to entertain as well as inform, adding sound, 
video, and animation can help you share more information more vividly and 
even make you look more professional.
The most complicated aspect of multimedia on the Web is choosing the best 
format for your audience, which is why you’ll find a primer on audio and 
video formats in this chapter. You can’t create or edit multimedia files in 
Dreamweaver; but after your files are optimized and ready for the Internet, 
Dreamweaver makes it relatively easy to add them to your Web pages.
As you discover in this chapter, inserting video, audio, and Flash files is 
similar to adding image files to Web pages, but with many more options, 
such as settings that control how and when multimedia files play.

290
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
Understanding Multimedia Players
When you add sound, video, or any other kind of multimedia to a Web site, 
your visitors may need a special player (sometimes with an associated plug-in) 
to play or view your files.
Players are small programs that work alone or with a Web browser to add 
support for functions, such as playing sound, video, and animation files. 
Some of the best-known multimedia players are the Flash Player, Windows 
Media Player, RealNetworks RealPlayer, and Apple QuickTime.
The challenge is that not everyone on the Web uses the same player, and 
viewers must have the correct player to view your multimedia files. As a 
result, you need a strategy that helps visitors play your multimedia easily, 
such as the following ones:
 
 Many Web developers offer audio and video in two or three formats so 
users can choose the one that best fits the players they already have.
 
 Some developers also include the same multimedia files in different file 
sizes so that visitors with slower connection speeds don’t have to wait 
as long. Optimizing multimedia for the Web works much as it does with 
images: The smaller the file size, the lower the quality but the faster the 
file downloads.
 
 Many Web developers also include information about how visitors can 
download and install the best player if they need it to view the files.
You can use Dreamweaver to insert or link to any type of multimedia file, but 
it’s up to you to choose the format that’s best for your audience. Although 
dozens of plug-ins are available for Web pages, Flash, Windows Media, and 
QuickTime are the most common on the Web today.
In general, I recommend that you avoid the more obscure players unless you’re 
offering specialized content that users have a good reason to download, such 
as a three-dimensional game that requires a special program to run.
Working with Adobe Flash
Flash has clearly emerged as the favorite technology for creating animations 
and a wide variety of interactive features on the Web. You can even integrate 
sound and video into Flash, making it a common choice for combining formats. 
Dreamweaver supports three different kinds of Flash files:

291
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
 Flash files: (extension .swf) The most versatile Flash format is the 
SWF file (pronounced SWIFF). Often referred to simply as Flash files, 
this format is sometimes called a Flash movie, even when it doesn’t 
include video. Flash files with a .swf extension can include illustrations, 
photos, animation sequences, and video. In Dreamweaver, use the 
Insert➪Media➪SWF option for this format. You find detailed instructions 
for working with Flash files in the following section.
 
 Flash video: (extension .flv) As the name implies, Flash video is a 
video format, although it can also be used for audio files. To convert 
video into the Flash video format, you need the Flash Video Encoder. 
In Dreamweaver, use the Insert➪Media➪FLV option for this format. 
You find detailed instructions for working with .flv Flash files in the 
“Adding Flash audio and video files” section later in this chapter 
 
 Flash Paper: Adobe’s Flash Paper makes it easy to turn documents, 
such as Word files, into Flash files with the .swf extension. Flash Paper 
files are ideal for displaying documents on the Web. When you insert a 
Flash Paper file into a Web page, you can include a Flash control bar to 
add interactivity much as you would with any other Flash file format. In 
Dreamweaver, use the Insert➪Media➪Flash Paper option for this format. 
For instructions on how to make changes to Flash settings after you’ve 
inserted a Flash Paper file, see the “Settings Flash properties,” section 
later in this chapter.
One thing that makes Flash files (with the .swf extension) so flexible and so fast 
on the Internet is that Flash uses vector graphics instead of bitmaps. Therefore, 
the graphics in Flash are based on mathematical descriptions (vectors) instead 
of dots (bitmaps), and those vector equations take up far less space than bit-
mapped images. Vector graphics can also be scaled up or down in size without 
affecting the image quality or the size of the downloaded file. This capability to 
scale makes Flash ideally suited for the many different monitor sizes used by 
Web viewers as well as for the tiny displays on cell phones and other handheld 
devices. You can even project Flash graphics on a wall or movie screen without 
losing quality, although any photographs or video files integrated into a Flash file 
may lose quality or look distorted at higher or lower resolutions.
 
To create a Flash file, you need Adobe Flash or a similar program that supports 
the Flash format. Because Flash is an open standard, you can create Flash files 
with a variety of programs, including Adobe Illustrator, which has an Export 
to SWF option. If want to know how to create full-featured Flash files, check 
out Adobe Flash CS4 For Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein and Gurdy Leete (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.). 
 
Flash is great overall but be aware of the important drawbacks:
 
 If you need printouts for some reason, Flash may not print as you would 
hope.

292
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 Flash may cause accessibility problems. Screen readers and other 
specialized viewers can’t read the text in a Flash file any better than 
they can read text in an image file. To make Flash files more accessible, 
include detailed alternative text.
 
 Text included in Flash files may not be read by search engines (although 
including alternative text can help with these limitations).
 
 Sites created entirely in Flash are harder to link to, especially if you want 
to link to a particular page within a site and not just to the front page of 
the site.
Inserting Flash SWF files
Flash files, often called Flash movies, use the .swf extension and can include 
animations, graphics, photos, and even video. Thanks to Dreamweaver, these 
files are relatively easy to insert into a Web page. In this section, I assume 
you have a completed Flash file (an animation or other Flash movie), and you 
want to add it to your Web page.
You insert a Flash file much as you insert an image file. But because Flash 
can do so much more than a still image, you have a variety of settings and 
options for controlling how your Flash file plays.
 
Before you start, make sure to save the Flash file you want to insert in the 
main folder for your Web site. I recommend creating a multimedia folder in 
your main Web site folder for audio and other multimedia files, just as most 
designers create an image folder for image files.
To add a Flash file to a Web site, open an existing page or create a new 
document and save the file. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Click where you want the Flash file to appear on your Web page.
 
2. If it’s not already open, choose Window➪Insert and then use the 
drop-down list to select the Common Insert panel.
 
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert panel, choose 
the SWF Flash option (see Figure 11-1).
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Media➪SWF. The Select File dialog box 
appears.
 
4. Browse to locate the Flash file that you want to insert in your page 
and click to select the file.
 
5. If you have accessibility options turned on, you’re prompted to add 
alternative text to describe the Flash file. Enter a description of the 
file and click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the Flash file is inserted into your document.

Dreamweaver displays Flash as a gray box with the dimensions of the Flash 
file. To display the Flash file, click to select it and then click the green Play 
button on the right side of the Property inspector. (In Figure 11-2, you see 
the Stop button because I’ve already clicked the Play button, which changed 
to the Stop button when the file began playing.) If you have the Flash player 
installed on your computer, the Flash file will also play when you preview the 
page in a browser.
Setting Flash properties
Like most HTML tags, the tags that link Flash and other multimedia files to Web 
pages have attributes (also called properties) that define how a file is displayed 
within a browser, controlling such actions as whether an animation plays 
automatically when a page is loaded or whether a visitor must click a link 
for the animation to begin. Dreamweaver automatically sets some of these 
options, such as the height and width of the Flash file, but you may want to 
specify others.
To display Flash attributes in the Property inspector, click to select the 
gray box that represents a Flash file after it’s inserted into a Web page. The 
following describes the Flash options included in the Property inspector, as 
shown in Figure 11-2.

If you don’t see all the options in the Property inspector, click the expander 
arrow in the lower-right corner to display the more advanced options.
 
 ID field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Property inspector, 
just to the right of the F icon, to assign a name to the file. Dreamweaver 
automatically enters a name, such as FlashID1, or FlashID2. You can change 
this name to something that has more meaning; just don’t use any spaces 
or special characters other than the dash or underscore. The name is 
important because it can be used to refer to the file in JavaScript.

 W (width): Use this option to specify the width of the file. The file is 
measured in pixels.
 
 H (height): Use this option to specify the height of the file. The file is 
measured in pixels.
 
 Reset Size: (This icon is only visible if you have changed the size of a 
Flash file.) You can change the display size of a Flash file by clicking a 
corner and dragging it or by entering a number in the height or width 
fields. When the size of a Flash file has been altered, a small, circular 
icon appears just to the right of the height and width fields. Clicking 
this circular icon reverts the Flash file to its original size. You can resize 
Flash files, unlike images, video, and many other file types, without 
affecting image quality because they’re vector-based. To keep the file 
proportionate, hold down the Shift key while you drag to resize the file.
 
 File: Dreamweaver automatically fills in this field when you insert a 
Flash file with the filename and path. You risk breaking the link to your 
flash file if you alter this field.
 
 Src (source): This text field enables you to identify the source file you 
used to create the .swf file inserted into a page. After this option is set, 
clicking the Edit button automatically opens the source file in Flash and 
provides a Done button to integrate changes back into Dreamweaver. 
Because the programs are integrated, any changes you make in Flash 
automatically reflect in Dreamweaver when you use this option.

295

 Edit: Click this button to open a Flash source file with the Adobe Flash 
program where you can edit it. Note that you can edit only the source 
Flash file. After saving the Flash file for Web use with the .swf extension, 
return to the original Flash file to edit it again.
 
 Class: Use this drop-down list to apply any class styles defined for the 
document.
 
 Loop: Selecting this box causes the Flash file to repeat (or loop). If you 
don’t select this box, the Flash movie stops after it reaches the last 
frame.
 
 Autoplay: Selecting this box causes the Flash movie to play as soon as it 
downloads to the viewer’s computer. If you don’t select this box, whatever 
option you’ve set within the Flash file itself (such as onMouseOver or 
onMouseDown) is required to start the movie.
 
 V Space (vertical space): If you want blank space above or below the 
file, enter the number of pixels.
 
 H Space (horizontal space): If you want blank space on either side of the 
file, enter the number of pixels.
 
 Quality: This option enables you to prioritize the anti-aliasing options of 
your images versus the speed of playback. Anti-aliasing, which makes your 
files appear smoother, can slow down the rendering of each frame because 
the computer must first smooth the edges. The Quality parameter enables 
you to regulate how much the process is slowed by letting you set priorities 
based on the importance of appearance versus playback speed. You can 
choose from these Quality options:
 
• Low: Anti-aliasing is never used. Playback speed has priority over 
appearance.
 
• High: Anti-aliasing is always used. Appearance has priority over 
playback speed.
 
• Auto High: With this option, playback is set to begin with anti-
aliasing turned on. However, if the frame rate supported by the 
user’s computer drops too low, anti-aliasing automatically turns 
off to improve playback speed. This option emphasizes playback 
speed and appearance equally at first but sacrifices appearance for 
the sake of playback speed, if necessary.
 
• Auto Low: Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned off. If the Flash 
player detects that the processor can handle it, anti-aliasing is 
turned on. Use this option to emphasize speed at first but improve 
appearance whenever possible.
 
 Scale: Specify this option only if you change the file’s original height 
and width size settings. The Scale parameter enables you to define how 
the Flash movie appears within those settings. The following options in 
the Scale drop-down list enable you to set preferences for how a scaled 
Flash movie appears within the window:

296
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
• Default (show all): This option enables the entire movie to 
appear in the specified area. The width and height proportions of 
the original movie are maintained and no distortion occurs, but 
borders may appear on two sides of the movie to fill the space.
 
• No Border: This option enables you to scale a Flash movie to fill a 
specified area. No borders appear and the original aspect ratio is 
maintained, but some cropping may occur.
 
• Exact Fit: The Flash movie is the exact width and height that are 
set, but the original aspect ratio may not be maintained and the 
movie may look squished.
 
 Align: This option controls the alignment of the file on the page. This 
setting works the same for plug-in files as for images.
 
 Wmode: Specify Window to display the flash file in a rectangular 
window on a Web page. Specify Opaque to hide everything behind 
a Flash file when you move or resize it using JavaScript. Specify 
Transparent to show the background of the HTML page though any 
transparent portions of the Flash file.
 
 Play button: Click the green Play button to play a Flash file in 
Dreamweaver. Note that when the Play button is activated, the button 
changes to Stop (refer to Figure 11-2).
 
 Parameters: This button provides access to a dialog box where you can 
enter parameters specific to your Flash files.
Finding Flash resources online
One of the best places to read more about 
creating Flash files is on the Internet, where a 
wide range of Web sites offers everything from 
predesigned Flash files you can easily customize 
to great ideas for getting the most from this 
award-winning technology. You may find these 
Web sites useful if you want to find out more 
about Flash:
  Adobe (www.adobe.com): You find 
loads of tips and tricks for creating and 
using Flash files (as well as many inspiring 
examples of Flash in action).
  Swish (www.swishzone.com): If you’re 
looking for an alternative to Adobe Flash, 
Swish is a great little program that’s more 
reasonably priced.
  Flash Kit (www.flashkit.com): You

Using scripts to make 
Flash function better
When you insert Flash or other multimedia files with Dreamweaver CS4, the 
program creates a collection of JavaScript files that help the Flash file play 
properly. The files are named things like, AC_RunActiveContent.js, and 
are stored in a Scripts folder, which Dreamweaver automatically creates 
inside your root site folder. The first time Dreamweaver creates this file, a 
dialog box alerts you that you need to upload the script for your multimedia 
file to work properly. Make sure you include this script when you publish 
your site on your Web server.
If you don’t include the script, your multimedia file may not play properly, 
or your visitors may be required to click the play button twice before the file 
begins to play.
Working with Video and 
Audio on the Web
As bandwidth has grown on the Web, the use of video files has grown more 
dramatically than almost any other multimedia file type. From YouTube to 
Google Video and MySpace to small personal Web sites, millions of video 
files are added to the Web every day. Adding a video file to a Web page 
with Dreamweaver is relatively easy, especially if you use the Flash video 
format described in the “Adding Flash audio and video files” section later 
in this chapter. If you use another video format, such as Windows Media 
Video or QuickTime, you find instructions for adding files in those formats 
in the following section, “Adding Audio and Video Files to Web Pages.” You 
can specify video and audio settings, such as Autoplay, by changing setting 
parameters, an option that is a little more complicated if you use any format 
other than Flash video. You find instructions for managing these settings in 
Dreamweaver in the “Setting options for audio and video files,” later in this 
chapter.
 
Instead of hosting your video on your own Web server, an alternative is to 
upload video files to the YouTube site and then include special code from 
the YouTube site in the HTML code of your Web pages so that the video 
plays within your pages, even though it’s hosted on YouTube. Visit YouTube.
com and follow their instructions for uploading video files. To learn how to 
add code from sites like YouTube to your own pages, visit my site at www.
DigitalFamily.com/dreamweaver and read the tutorial on adding code 
from Google, YouTube, and other sites in Dreamweaver.

298
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
The first challenge to working with multimedia is choosing the right format 
and optimizing your video so it downloads quickly and still looks good. 
Optimizing video is beyond the scope of this book, but I’ve included some 
general information about video formats to help you make more informed 
decisions about the type of video files to add to your pages.
Unfortunately, no single video format works for everyone on the Web 
(although Flash video is gaining popularity fast). Most new computers come 
with preinstalled video and audio players that play the most common file 
formats. If you use a Windows computer, you probably have Windows Media 
Player on your computer. If you use a Mac, you have QuickTime. Both video 
players can handle multiple video formats, so anyone with a relatively new 
computer can likely view video in common formats.
 
Many people surf the Web in their offices, in libraries, and in other locations 
where unexpected sound can be jarring, disruptive, or worse. Always give 
people a warning before you play video or audio and always give users a way 
to turn audio off quickly when necessary.
Comparing popular video formats
You can convert video from one file format to another relatively easily with 
most video-editing programs. You can open a video in AVI (Audio Video 
Interleave) format in a program, such as Adobe Premier Elements (a good 
video editor for beginners), and then choose File➪Export to convert it to 
any of a dozen formatting and compression options. For example, you could 
convert an AVI file to the Windows Media format with the compression 
setting for a 56K modem or into the QuickTime format with the compression 
setting for a cable modem. Editing video can get complicated, and 
optimizing video for the best quality with the fastest download time is both 
an art and a science, but the most basic process of converting a video file 
isn’t difficult after you understand the conversion options. Because Flash 
video is increasingly popular and because a free trial version of the Flash 
video encoder is available on the Adobe.com Web site, I’ve included basic 
instructions for using the encoder in the section, “Converting video files 
into Flash format with the Flash video encoder,” later in this chapter. (To 
download the encoder, visit www.adobe.com/products/flash/flash
pro/productinfo/encoder.)
The following sections provide a brief description of the most common digital 
video formats, their file extensions, and a Web address where you can find out 
more about each option.
Flash video
You can create Flash videos with Adobe Flash. Because the Flash player is so 
popular on the Web, many developers consider Flash one of the best options 
available today.

 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
File extension: .flv
Web site: www.adobe.com
Windows Media Video
Defined by Microsoft and popular on the PC, this video format supports 
streaming and plays with Windows Media Player as well as many other popular 
players.
File extension: .wmv
Web site: www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
RealVideo
RealNetworks designed the RealVideo file format to play in RealPlayer 
(available for Mac and PC). RealMedia provides optimization well suited 
to low-speed and high-speed connections but requires special software on 
your Web server for streaming.
File extension: .rm, .rv
Web site: www.real.com
QuickTime
The QuickTime player is built into the Macintosh operating system and is 
used by most Mac programs that include video or animation. QuickTime is 
a great format for video on the Web and supports streaming, but it’s used 
primarily by those who favor Macs (although QuickTime files can be viewed 
on Windows computers as well).
File extension: .qt, .mov
Web site: www.quicktime.com
AVI
Created by Microsoft, AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is one the most common 
video formats on Windows computers and can play on most common video 
players. AVI is fine if you’re viewing video on a CD or on your hard drive, 
where the file doesn’t have to download, but you can’t optimize AVI files 
well for use on the Internet. If your files are in AVI, convert them to one of 
the other formats before adding them to your Web site. Otherwise, you force 
your visitors to download unnecessarily large video files.
File extension: .avi
Web site: No one site about AVI exists, but you can find information if 
you search for AVI at www.microsoft.com

Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
Comparing popular audio formats
Audio works much like video on the Web. You can link to a sound file or 
embed the file into your page; either way, your visitors need to have the right 
player to listen to the file. You find instructions for adding both audio and 
video files to your pages in the following section, “Adding Audio and Video 
Files to Web Pages.”
The following sections provide a brief description of the most common digital 
audio formats, their file extensions, and a Web address where you can find out 
more about each option.
MP3
One of the most successful audio compression formats, MP3 supports 
streaming audio. Most music you can download from the Internet is in MP3 
format, and it’s clearly the first choice of many Web developers. MP3 files can 
be played by most popular multimedia players on the Web.
File extension: .mp3
Web site: www.mp3.com
Windows Audio
Microsoft’s Windows Audio format supports streaming and can be played 
with Windows Media Player as well as many other popular players. It also 
offers digital rights management functionality.
File extension: .wma
Web site: www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
Streaming media plays faster
To stream multimedia means to play a file while 
it’s downloading from the server. This is a 
valuable trick on the Web because video and 
audio files can take a long time to download. 
Here’s how streaming works. When you click a 
link to a video file, your computer begins to down-
load it from the server. If you’re using a player that 
supports streaming, the video or audio file 
begins to play as soon as enough of the 
file downloads successfully to ensure an 
uninterrupted experience. If you don’t use 
streaming, the entire file must download before 
playing. Although it can take the same amount 
of time to download the entire file, streaming 
can greatly reduce the time your visitors need 
to wait before they can start viewing a video 
online.

301
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
RealAudio
RealAudio, designed by RealNetworks, is a streaming file format that plays in 
RealPlayer (available for Mac and PC). RealAudio is especially popular among 
radio stations and entertainment sites.
File extension: .ra
Web site: www.real.com
WAV
The WAV file format is popular in digital media because it offers the highest 
sound quality possible. Audio files in this format are often too big for use on 
the Web, averaging 10MB for a minute of audio. (In comparison, an MP3 file 
that is five times longer can be less than one-third the size.) Although WAV 
files are commonly used on the Internet because of their nearly universal 
compatibility, I recommend that you convert WAV files (especially for long 
audio clips) to one of the other audio formats.
File extension: .wav
Web site: No official Web site exists for WAV files, but you can find some 
documentation at www.microsoft.com when you search for WAV.
Adding Audio and Video 
Files to Web Pages
Like other multimedia files, you can link to an audio or a video file or you can 
insert multimedia files into a page. Linking to a multimedia file is as easy as 
linking to any other file, as you see in the instructions that follow. Inserting 
an audio or a video file is a little more complicated, but it lets a visitor play 
the file without leaving the Web page. Inserting audio and video files is cov-
ered in this section. If you’re using Flash video or audio, see the “Adding 
Flash audio and video files” section, later in this chapter.
Linking to audio and video files
To use Dreamweaver to link to a video file, an audio file, or another multime-
dia file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to select the text, image, or other element you want to use to 
create a link.
 
 This works just like creating a link to another Web page (see Figure 11-3).

302
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 If you’re linking to a video file, a good trick is to take a single still image 
from the video and insert that into your Web page. Then create a link 
from that image to the video file.
 
Figure 11-3: 
Link to an 
audio or a 
video file 
just as you’d 
create a link 
to another 
Web page.
 
 
2. Choose Insert ➪Hyperlink or click the Hyperlink icon in the Common 
Insert panel.
 
 The Hyperlink dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Browse button just to the right of the 
Link field in the Property inspector. (The Browse button looks like a 
small file folder.)
 
3. Enter the text you want to serve as a link in the Text field.
 
 If you selected a section of text on the page before opening the 
Hyperlink dialog box, that text automatically appears in the Text field.
 
4. Enter the URL where the audio or video file is located.
 
 Alternatively, click the Browse button (the small file folder icon) to the 
right of the Link field and browse your hard drive to find the video or 
audio file you want to link to.
 
 As with any other file you link to, make sure you’ve saved your audio or 
video files into your main Web site folder.
 
 Note that you can link to an audio or video file on another Web site, as 
I’ve done in the example shown in Figure 11-3, but you need to have the 
exact URL of the file’s location.
 
5. Click to select the file you want to link to and then click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the link is created automatically.
 
6. (Optional) Choose _blank from the Target drop-down list if you want 
the video file to open in a new browser window or tab.
 
7. To specify Accessibility settings, enter a Title, Access Key, and Tab 
Index.

303
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
8. Click OK to add the hyperlink and to close the Hyperlink dialog box.
 
 
9. Click the Preview button (at the top of the work area) to open the page 
in a browser, where you can test the link to your multimedia file.
 
 Dreamweaver launches your specified Web browser and displays the 
page. If you have the necessary player, the file downloads, your player 
launches, and your file automatically plays.
 
Many people like to have multimedia files, such as video, pop up in a new 
browser window. To do this, create an HTML file and embed your multimedia 
file in it. Then use the Open Browser Window behavior in Dreamweaver to 
create a pop-up window that displays your multimedia page. For more on how 
to work with Dreamweaver behaviors, see Chapter 10.
Inserting audio and video files
When you insert an audio or a video file into a Web page, you can set the file 
to play automatically when the page loads (as long as your visitor has the 
necessary player), or you can require that your visitors click the Play button 
first. Either way, when you insert an audio or a video file into a page, the file 
will play within the page instead of requiring that the video or audio player 
be opened separately.
To use Dreamweaver to embed an audio or a video file into a Web page, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click where you want the file to appear on your Web page.
 
 If you’re inserting a sound file, the play, pause, and stop controls appear 
wherever you insert the file. If you’re inserting a video file, the first 
frame of the video appears where you insert the file.
 
2. Select Common from the Insert panel, and in the Media drop-down 
list, choose Plugin (see Figure 11-4).
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Media➪Plugin. The Select File dialog box 
appears.
 
 Use the Plugin option for all audio and video file types — except Flash 
video (.flv) files.
 
3. Browse your hard drive to locate the sound or video file you want 
inserted in your page and then click to select it.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes, and the file is inserted automatically into the 
page. A small icon (resembling a puzzle piece) represents the file.

304
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
Figure 11-4: 
Use the 
Plugin 
option to 
insert any 
audio or 
video file 
that isn’t 
saved in 
the Flash 
format.
 
 
 When you add audio or video, Dreamweaver doesn’t automatically 
determine the file size, so you need to add that information in the 
Property inspector after you insert the file. After you set the correct file 
size, the plug-in icon changes to reflect the specified size.
 
5. Click the Plugin icon that represents the file in the Web page to 
display the file options in the Property inspector and specify your 
desired settings.
 
 You find a description of each option in the next section, “Setting 
options for audio and video files.”
 
 
6. Click the Preview button (at the top of the work area) to open the page 
in a browser.
 
 Dreamweaver doesn’t include a Play button for audio and video files 
(unless they’re in the Flash format). If you have the necessary player 
on your computer and you have the file set to Autoplay (the default 
setting), your file plays automatically when the page loads into the 
browser. To change video and audio settings that aren’t included in 
the Property inspector, such as Autoplay, see the “Setting multimedia 
parameters” section later in this chapter.
Setting options for audio and video files
When you select an inserted multimedia file, such as a sound or a video file, 
the Property inspector displays the options for the file, as shown in Figure 
11-5. Among these settings, the height and width are the most important. 

305
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
Unlike image files or Flash files, Dreamweaver can’t automatically detect the 
height and width of other audio or video formats, so it’s important to set 
these options in the Property inspector. To determine the height and width 
of a video file, you may need to open the file in a video-editing program. For 
audio files, set the height and width based on the size required for the player 
you’re using.
The following describes the multimedia options available from the Property 
inspector:
 
 ID field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Property 
inspector, just to the right of the plug-in icon, if you want to assign 
a name to the file. If you leave this field blank, Dreamweaver doesn’t 
enter a name automatically unless you are using a file in a Flash format. 
The name is important because it can be used to refer to the file in 
JavaScript.
 
Figure 11-5: 
Select an 
audio or a 
video file 
in Dream-
weaver, 
such as the

Media 
video shown 
here, to 
display the 
properties 
for the file in 
the Property 
inspector.
 
 
 W (width) and H (height): Specify the measurement of the file in pixels.
 
 Src (source): This option specifies the name and path to the file. You 
can type a filename or click the Browse button (which looks like a small 
yellow folder) to browse for the file. This field is filled in automatically 
when you embed the file.

306
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 Plg URL: This option enables you to provide a URL where viewers can 
download the plug-in if they don’t already have it.
 
 Align: This option enables you to specify how the element aligns on the 
page. Alignment works just as it does for images.
 
 Play button: Click the green Play button to preview the media file. The 
media plug-in must be installed in Dreamweaver (in the Configuration/
Plugins folder) for it to be previewed in Dreamweaver.
 
 Class: Use this drop-down list to apply any style sheets defined for the 
document.
 
 V Space (vertical space): If you want blank space above and below the 
plug-in, enter the number of pixels here.
 
 H Space (horizontal space): If you want blank space on either side of the 
plug-in, enter the number of pixels or use a percentage to specify a portion 
of the browser window’s width.
 
 Border: This option specifies the width of the border around the file 
when it is displayed.
 
 Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box where you can 
enter additional parameters specific to the type of multimedia file you 
inserted. For more information, see the following section.
Setting multimedia parameters
You can use parameters to control a wide range of multimedia options, such as 
whether a video file or an audio file starts playing as soon as a page is loaded. 
Setting parameters isn’t intuitive, and Dreamweaver doesn’t do the best job of 
helping with these settings. However, with some research on the options for 
the file type you’re using and a little care in using the Parameters dialog box in 
Dreamweaver, you can have a lot more control over your multimedia files.
In fairness to the programmers who created Dreamweaver, it’d be hard to 
include all the parameters for all the possible multimedia file types in use on 
the Web today, but they could’ve included the common ones. Because they 
don’t, I offer you this brief primer on using the parameters setting and a few 
common options for a few common file types. You also find Web addresses 
where you can find more complete lists of parameters for a few of the most 
popular audio and video formats.
In Figure 11-6, you see the Parameter dialog box with settings for a Windows 
Media Video file. The following steps outline how the process works:
 
1. To access the Parameters dialog box, click to select the multimedia 
file in the Web page and then click the Parameters button in the 
Property inspector.

307
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
 The Parameters dialog box opens. The dialog is blank unless you have 
already entered parameters for the selected file.
 
2. Use the plus sign (+) at the top of the dialog box to add a parameter; 
use the minus sign (–) to delete a selected parameter.
 
3. On the left side of the dialog box, enter the name of the parameter, 
such as autoplay; on the right side, enter the value you want, such 
as false, which I’ve entered in this example to prevent the Windows 
Video file from playing automatically.
 
You can move from the name side of the Parameters dialog box to the value 
side using the tab key or by clicking to insert your cursor.
 
Figure 11-6: 
Add 
parameters 
for 
additional 
audio and 
video 
settings.
 
To help you get started with parameters, here are some of the most common 
and valuable parameters:
 
 Autoplay (or Autostart, depending on the file type): By default, when 
you add video or audio to an HTML file, most browsers play the file as 
soon as the page loads (except Firefox, which gives users more control). 
If you want to prevent your multimedia files from playing automatically 
in Internet Explorer and other browsers, set the Autoplay or Autostart 
parameter to false. Think of true and false as on and off when it 
comes to parameters.
 
 Loop: This parameter enables you to control whether a video file or an 
audio file loops, or continue to play over and over.
 
 showControls: This option makes it possible to hide the video or audio 
controls for a file.
 
 Be careful about combining options like these. For example, if you set 
Autoplay to false and showControls to false, your visitor can never 
play your file. By default, the controls for most multimedia files are visible 
unless you set the showControls parameter to false.

Adding Flash audio and video files
Flash video is fast becoming the video format of choice among many designers. 
Video on the Web has been problematic for a long time because there are so 
many different formats, and you can never guarantee that everyone in your 
audience can view your videos in any one format.
But while the video players were fighting it out, Flash stepped in to provide 
an option that’s increasingly well supported because so many people have 
the Flash Player and the player’s such a small and easy download for those 
who don’t have it.
Because Adobe owns both Flash and Dreamweaver, you find much better 
support for Flash files in Dreamweaver. An Insert dialog box makes it easy 
to set parameters for Flash. The Insert FLV dialog box is displayed in Figure 
11-7. Dreamweaver can even automatically detect the size of Flash video files. 
You can also use Flash to create and insert audio files, displaying only the 
player (called a skin in Flash)
 
Figure 11-7: 
You can 
specify 
how a Flash 
video will be 
displayed in 
a Web page 
in the Insert 
FLV dialog 
box.
 

309
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
Follow these steps to insert a Flash video file into a Web page:
 
1. Click where you want the file to appear on your Web page.
 
2. Select Common from the Insert panel, and from the Media drop-down 
list, choose FLV (refer to Figure 11-1).
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Media➪FLV. The Insert FLV dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 11-7.
 
3. At the top of the dialog box, specify Streaming or Progressive.
 
 You must have a special server for streaming video. Check with your 
Internet hosting service or system administrator to find out whether 
your Web server supports streaming Flash files. If not, choose 
Progressive.
 
4. Click the Browser button to the right of the URL field and browse to 
find the Flash FLV file you want to add to the page and Click OK.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically adds the file name and path to your Flash 
file to the URL field. 
 
5. Choose a skin from the Skin drop-down list.
 
 Dreamweaver calls the controls for a Flash file a skin. As you can see in 
Figure 11-7, a preview of the selected skin is displayed in the dialog box 
so you can better decide which one is best for your Flash file and your 
design. You can also create custom skins in Adobe Flash.
 
6. Click the Detect Size button to insert the height and width of the 
inserted Flash file (if Dreamweaver hasn’t already done so).
 
7. If you want the Flash video to play as soon as the page is loaded, 
select the Auto Play check box.
 
8. If you want the video to rewind after play is complete, select the Auto 
Rewind check box.
 
9. Click OK to insert the Flash file and close the dialog box.
 
 The Flash file appears on the page, represented by a gray box that’s the 
height and width of the file. To view the Flash video, preview the page in 
a Web browser.
 
When you insert a Flash video file and include a skin for the player, 
Dreamweaver creates a Flash file for the player with the .swf extension 
and saves the file in your root site folder. This Flash file contains the player 
controls and must be uploaded to your Web site when you publish the page 
with the Flash file for the player controls to work.
You can change the skin by clicking to select the inserted Flash file and using 
the Skin drop-down list in the Property inspector to select another option, as 
shown in Figure 11-8. Each time you choose a skin, Dreamweaver creates a 
new .swf file. You can delete any skins that aren’t being used.

Converting video files into Flash format 
with the Flash video encoder
If you want to convert video from nearly any video format into the Flash 
video format, you can use the Flash video encoder. The following exercise 
walks you through the process of converting a video file into Flash video with 
the Flash video encoder. The Flash video encoder is included in the Adobe 
CS4 Creative Suite and can be downloaded at www.adobe.com.
 
1. Launch the Flash video encoder, as shown in Figure 11-9.
 
2. Click the Add button to load a video into the encoder that you want to 
convert into a Flash video file.
 
 In this example, I added a short video clip that was saved in the 
Windows Media Video (WMV) format, but you can add video in a variety 
of formats, including AVI and QuickTime. For best results, start with a 
video that hasn’t already been compressed.

 The later the version of Flash, the better the encoding looks and the 
faster it plays, but here’s the trade off: Not everyone has downloaded 
the latest version, so an earlier version may mean fewer visitors have 
to download the player to view your video. Because Flash is such a fast 
and easy program to download, the latest version is generally the best 
choice though.
 
5. Click the Video tab and specify additional video settings.
 
a. Make sure Encode Video is checked. The video codec (which 
controls the compression of the video) is set automatically based 
on the Flash version you selected in the Encoding Profiles. Select 
Deinterlace only if you’re encoding video that’s interlaced, such 
as video captured from a television or VCR. Video that’s already 
been encoded in a format like Windows Media doesn’t need to be 
Deinterlaced.
 
b. Set Framerate to the lowest setting that will look good to achieve 
the fastest download time. If you’re encoding a video that has lots 
of action, you need a higher frame rate, ideally 24 or better, or your 
video will lose details and look fuzzy in places. If you’re converting 
a video, such as a Windows Media file that’s already been encoded, 
your best option is to choose Same as Source to leave the 
framerate unchanged.
 
c. Set the Quality to the lowest level that still looks good to get the 
fastest download times. Use the slider under the preview window 
to move through the frames of the video to see the effects of your 
settings.
 
6. Click the Audio tab to adjust audio settings.
 
 Under the Audio tab, adjust the Data rate. Again the lower the number, 
the lower the quality but the faster the download. If your audio has only 
a single voice, you can set this quite low, and it’ll still sound good. If 
your audio file has music, special sound effects, or other multifaceted 
audio, set the Data rate to at least 96 kbps (kilobits per second).
 
7. Use the Cue Points tab and insert cues in the file that make it easier 
for someone using the file to jump to a particular section.
 
8. Use the Crop and Resize tab to make the file physically smaller or larger.
 
 Note that trying to increase the file size of a video can result in a severe 
loss of quality.
 
9. After the settings are complete, press OK.
 
 The Flash Video Encoder Settings dialog box closes, returning you to the 
Flash video encoder.
 
10. Click Start Queue to begin the encoding process.

 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
 This process can take several minutes, even for a very short file. A small 
preview window in the bottom-right corner of the Flash video encoder 
enables you to watch the encoding process in action.
 
 When the encoding process is complete, the Flash video encoder has 
created a copy of the video file in the FLV Flash video format.
Working with Java
Java is a programming language, similar to Basic, C, or C++, that you can use 
to create programs that run on a computer. What makes Java special is that 
it can run on any computer system and can display within a browser.
If you create a program in another programming language, you usually have to 
create one version for the Macintosh, another for the PC, and a third for Unix. 
But Java, created by Sun Microsystems, is platform-independent, so develop-
ers can use it to create almost any kind of program — even complex programs, 
such as a sophisticated game or even a word processing program — that 
works on any type of computer without the user having to customize the code 
for each platform.
Another advantage of Java is that the program (dubbed an applet) can run 
within a Web browser, allowing the program to interact with different 
elements of the page or with other pages on the Web. This capability has 
made Java popular on the Internet because it provides a way to add 
sophisticated capabilities to Web pages irrespective of the operating 
system the Web browser is running on. You can embed Java applets in Web 
pages, you can use Java to generate entire Web pages, or you can run Java 
applications separately after they download.
Inserting Java applets
To insert a Java applet in your Web page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click where you want the applet to appear on your Web page.
 
2. Select Common from the Insert panel, if it isn’t already selected. In 
the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert panel, choose Applet 
(refer to Figure 11-4).
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Media➪Applet. The Select File 
dialog box appears.
 
3. Use the Browse button to locate the Java applet file you want to insert 
on the page.
 
4. Click to highlight the filename and then click OK to close the dialog box.

314
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 Dreamweaver doesn’t display applets in the Dreamweaver work area. 
Instead, you see an icon that represents the applet. To view the applet 
on your Web page (the only way to see the applet in action), preview the 
page in a browser that supports applets, such as Navigator 4.0 and later 
or Internet Explorer 4.0 and later.
 
5. Click the Applet icon to open the Property inspector.
 
 You can set many options in the Property inspector. If you want to know 
more about these options, read on.
Setting Java parameters and other options
Like other file formats that require plug-ins or advanced browser support, 
the display of Java applets can be controlled by specifying a number of 
options. If you select a Java applet in Dreamweaver, the Property inspector 
displays the following options:
 
 Applet name: Use this field in the upper-left corner if you want to type 
a name for your applet. Dreamweaver doesn’t apply a name if you leave 
this field blank. This name identifies the applet for scripting.
 
 W (width): This option specifies the width of the applet. You can set 
the measurement in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s 
width.
 
 H (height): This option specifies the height of the applet. You can set 
the measurement in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s 
height.
 
 Code: Dreamweaver automatically enters the code when you insert the 
file. Code specifies the content file of the applet. You can type your own 
filename or click the folder icon to choose a file.
 
 Base: Automatically entered when you insert the file, Base identifies the 
folder that contains the applet.
 
 Align: This option determines how the object aligns on the page. 
Alignment works just as it does for images.
 
 Alt: This option enables you to specify an alternative file, such as an 
image, that appears if the viewer’s browser doesn’t support Java. That 
way, the user doesn’t see a broken file icon. If you type text in this field, 
the viewer sees this text; Dreamweaver writes it into the code by using 
the Alt attribute of the <applet> tag. If you use the folder icon to 
select an image, the viewer sees an image; Dreamweaver automatically 
inserts an <img> tag within the <applet> and </applet> tags of the 
applet.
 
 V Space (vertical space): If you want blank space above or below the 
applet, enter the number of pixels here.

315
 Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia
 
 H Space (horizontal space): If you want blank space on either side of the 
applet, enter the number of pixels here.
 
 Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box in which you can 
enter additional parameters for the applet.
 
 Class: Use this drop-down list to access style sheets created with CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets).
You can find lots more information in Java For Dummies, 4th Edition, by 
Barry Burd (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Linking to PDFs
Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) has become increasingly popular 
on the Internet, and with good reason. Now that Acrobat Reader is widely 
distributed and even built into more recent browser versions, you can 
assume that most of your audience can read files in PDF.
PDF is a great option for files that you want to make easy to download in their 
entirety to be saved on a hard drive, as well as documents that you want 
printed exactly as they’re designed.
To add a PDF file to your Web site, simply copy the file into your main root folder 
and link to it as you’d link to any other Web page on your site. When you upload 
the page with the link to your PDF file, make sure to upload the PDF as well.
JavaScript is not Java
JavaScript is a scripting language; Java is a 
programming language. Despite the similarity 
in their names, the two have little in common. 
Although JavaScript is much more complex 
than HTML, it’s much simpler than Java and has 
far fewer capabilities. Unlike Java, JavaScript 
can be written directly into HTML code to create 
interactive features, such as rollover effects. 
Dreamweaver uses JavaScript to create most 
of the features included in the Behaviors panel 
(covered in Chapter 10).
You can use Java to create more complex 
programming than you can create with 
JavaScript. Java programs, or applets, are 
usually small, self-contained programs that 
can run on any operating system. If you search 
the Web for Java applets, you’re likely to 
find cool little clocks, converters, and other 
programs that you can download and add to 
your Web pages. You can use Java to create 
programs that work on both the Mac and PC, an 
advantage over other programming languages 
that makes Java especially well-suited to the 
multiplatform world of Web design.

 Creating radio buttons, check boxes, and text fields
 Adding drop-down lists, Submit/Reset buttons, and jump menus
 Connecting forms to CGI scripts
 Working with hidden fields
F
orms follow function, to paraphrase the old saying. On the Web, many 
of the most advanced and interactive features you can add to a Web 
page require forms to collect information from users — information that can 
then be used in a variety of ways. Forms are commonly used to create guest 
books, contact forms, search engine entry fields, chat rooms, and discussion 
areas.
When you design a form, Dreamweaver makes it relatively easy to create 
check boxes, radio buttons, text boxes, and other common form elements. 
You’ll also find options in Dreamweaver for specifying text box sizes, char-
acter limits, and other features. After you build your form, you may want to 
consider formatting options, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), to make it 
look good.
But if you want your form to actually do something, you have to pair it with 
a program on your Web server. One of the most confusing aspects of work-
ing with HTML forms is that they don’t do much until you’ve connected them 
to a script. Most forms are processed by Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
scripts or some other program. These scripts can be written in different pro-
gramming languages, including C, C#, Java, and Perl. CGI scripts are far more 
complex than simple HTML files, and even experienced Web designers often 
purchase third-party solutions or hire experienced programmers to develop 
CGI scripts for them, especially for complex features, such as discussion 
boards or shopping carts.

318
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
Fortunately for those who don’t have a computer science degree or a huge 
budget for programmers, many free and low-priced scripts are available on 
the Web. Search the Internet for CGI scripts and you’ll find an impressive col-
lection of ready-to-use programs, many of them free. Be aware, however, that 
when you download a program, you could be creating a security risk for your 
server (so look for trustworthy scripts with good reviews and support).
You also have to know how to configure and install any script you download 
on your Web server, which may require special access. How you install a 
script on your server depends on how your server is set up. Unfortunately, 
in this book, I can’t show you everything there is to know about working with 
all the different kinds of scripts available on the Web on all the different kinds 
of servers, but I do try to give you an idea of what’s involved in working with 
CGI scripts and what you’ll need to do in Dreamweaver to make sure your 
HTML form will work with a script.
The first part of this chapter includes instructions for creating the common 
elements in an HTML form, from radio buttons to text boxes. In the last part 
of the chapter, I include instructions for configuring a form to work with a 
common CGI that you can use to send the contents of a form to any specified 
e-mail address. The steps and features covered in the final exercise also help 
you with other kinds of CGI scripts.
 
You also need to create forms when you build dynamic Web sites using 
Dreamweaver’s ColdFusion, ASP.NET, or PHP features. If you’re creating a 
dynamic or database-driven site, use the features specific to those technolo-
gies, which are covered in Chapters 14 and 15. In this chapter, you find out 
how to create the HTML forms in Dreamweaver.
Creating HTML Forms
The basic elements of HTML forms — radio buttons, check boxes, and text 
areas, for example — are easy to create with Dreamweaver. The following 
steps walk you through creating an HTML form. Start with an open page — 
either a new page or an existing page to which you want to add a form:
 
 
1. Choose Insert➪Form➪Form or click the Form icon on the Forms 
Insert bar.
 
 The Forms Insert bar displays all the common form elements. An empty 
<form> tag is inserted in your document and is displayed as a rectangle 
outlined by a red dotted line like the one shown in the Document area 
in Figure 12-1. This dotted line defines the boundaries of a form in the 
HTML code.

319
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Forms 
Insert bar 
provides 
easy access 
to all

elements.
 
The form tag outline
 
 You can control the display of invisible elements, such as <form> tags. 
Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences 
(Mac). Then, in the Invisible Elements category, select or deselect the 
Form Delimiter box.
 
2. Click the red outline to select the <form> tag and display the <form> 
tag options in the Property inspector (as shown in the bottom of 
Figure 12-1).
 
3. In the Form ID text box, type a name.
 
 You can choose any name for this field as long as you don’t use spaces, 
special characters, or punctuation. With your basic HTML form set up, 
you’re ready to add elements to it, as explained in the following 
sections.
 
Before you begin filling your form with options, keep the following tips in 
mind:

320
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 The best way to get your form fields to line up nicely is to use CSS. By 
creating styles that control the spacing and padding of form elements, 
you can make all your fields, buttons, and other elements line up neatly. 
Chapters 5 and 6 cover CSS.
 
 After you design your form, your work isn’t quite done; your form 
won’t do anything unless you configure it to work with a script. 
Although Dreamweaver doesn’t provide any scripts, it does make link-
ing your HTML forms to a script or database relatively easy. The section 
“Understanding How CGI Scripts Work” later in this chapter offers more 
details on making your form work with a script.
 
 Most of the fields displayed in the Property inspector when the <form> 
tag options are displayed should be set based on the CGI script or other 
program that’s used to collect and process the data from the form. You 
find instructions for filling in these fields in the “Configuring your form 
to work with a script” section, at the end of this chapter.
Making forms accessible
You can make your forms much easier to use 
and more accessible to all your visitors by using 
the label tag and other accessibility attributes 
with form items. Dreamweaver makes this 
easy by including an Input Tag Accessibility 
Attributes dialog box, as shown in the figure. 
For this dialog box to appear when you insert a 
form item, such as a radio button or a check box, 
you must have accessibility features turned on 
in Dreamweaver’s Preference settings. To turn 
on these features, choose Edit➪Preferences 
(Dreamweaver➪Preferences on a Mac); in the 
Preferences dialog box, click the Accessibility 
category and select the Form Objects option.
With the accessibility options turned on, when 
you insert a form item (such as a radio button or 
a text box), the Input Tag Accessibility Attributes 
dialog box opens automatically. Use this dialog 
box to specify the following options:

321
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
Creating radio buttons and check boxes
Radio buttons and check boxes make filling in a form easy for viewers of your 
site. Rather than make users type a word, such as yes or no, you can provide 
radio buttons and check boxes so that users can simply click boxes or buttons.
What’s the difference between radio buttons and check boxes? Radio buttons 
enable users to select only one option from a group. Thus, radio buttons are 
good for either/or options or situations in which you want users to make only 
one selection. Check boxes, on the other hand, enable users to make multiple 
choices, so they’re good for choose-all-that-apply situations or for situations 
that require approval, such as “Check this box if . . .”
Creating radio buttons
To create radio buttons on a form, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the boundary of the <form> tag 
where you want to add a radio button.
  ID: Use the ID field to assign a name to 
a form element. You can leave this field 
blank, and Dreamweaver won’t enter a 
name automatically. The name is impor-
tant because it can be used to refer to the 
field in JavaScript. The ID is also used if 
you choose Attach Label Tag Using ‘For’ 
Attribute option under the Style options.
  Label: Enter a name that corresponds to the 
radio button or check box. This is the name 
that’s read by a screen reader.
  Style: Check one of these three options to 
specify how the label should be included 
with the radio button or text box in the 
HTML code. The option Attach Label Tag 
Using ‘For’ Attribute is recommended as the 
best option for accessibility. If you choose 
this option, most browsers will associate a 
focus rectangle to the check box or radio 
button. This enables a user to select the 
check box and radio button by clicking any-
where in the text associated with it, instead 
of clicking precisely inside the check box or 
radio button.
  Position: Check the corresponding box to 
specify whether the label should appear 
before or after each form item.
  Access Key: This attribute enables you to 
create a keyboard shortcut for each of your 
form items. You can enter any letter in this 
field, and your users can select the form 
item by holding down the Alt key (Windows) 
or the Control key (Macintosh) and typing 
the letter you specify. For example, if you 
enter Q as the Access Key, visitors to your 
site who use a Windows computer could 
press Alt+Q to select the form item.
  Tab Index: By default, you can use the Tab 
key to move from one form field to another 
when you view a form on the Web. With 
the Tab Index, you can specify the order 
in which the Tab key progresses from one 
form item to another. This is especially help-
ful if you have links and other form items on 
a page, and you want the user to be able 
to tab through them in a specific order. To 
control the order, assign a number to each 
form.

322
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted the <form> tag, follow the steps in the section 
“Creating HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the Radio Button icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Radio Button. Either way, a radio 
button appears inside the form’s red boundary line.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input 
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See the sidebar “Making 
forms accessible,” to find out more about these options.)
 
3. Repeat Step 2 until you have the number of radio buttons you want.
 
4. Select one of the radio buttons on the form to reveal the radio but-
ton’s properties in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Radio button 
properties.
 
 
5. In the Radio Button text box on the far left of the Property inspector, 
type a name.
 
 All radio buttons in a group should have the same name so that the 
browser associates them with one another and prevents users from 
selecting more than one. If you want users to be able to choose more 
than one item from a list, use check boxes, as described in the following 
section.
 
6. In the Checked Value text box, type a name.
 
 Each radio button in a group should have a different Checked Value 
name so that it can be distinguished from the others. Naming radio but-
tons for the thing they represent is often a good practice; for example, 
yes when the choice is yes and no when it’s no. If you’re asking users 
about their favorite ice cream flavors, you might use as values the flavor 
each button represents. This name is usually included in the data you 
get back when the form is processed and returned to you (it can be 
returned in an e-mail message or sent directly to a database). How the 
data is returned depends on the CGI script or other programming used 
to process the form. If you’re looking at the data later, interpreting it is 
easier if the name is something that makes sense to you.
 
7. For the Initial State option, select Checked or Unchecked.

323
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
 
 These two options determine whether the radio button on your form 
appears already selected when the Web page loads. Select Checked if 
you want to preselect a choice. You should set only one radio button 
option to be preselected and remember that the user can always over-
ride this setting by selecting another radio button.
 
8. Select the other radio buttons one by one in the main design area and 
repeat Steps 5–7 to specify the properties in the Property inspector for 
each one.
 
If you want to create a series of radio buttons, you’ll find some advantages to 
using the Radio Group button in the Insert Form panel. Dreamweaver auto-
matically creates IDs for each radio button. If you want to change these IDs, 
you may find it easier to change them in Code view. You can split the screen 
between code and design views by clicking on the Split view button at the top 
of the workspace.
If you want to format your form with CSS styles, you can create tag styles 
for the form, radio button, and other tags, or you can create class styles and 
apply them to any or all of your tags using the Class drop-down list in the 
Property inspector, You find more information about creating and applying 
styles in Chapters 5 and 6.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Creating check boxes
To create check boxes, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the boundary of the <form> tag 
where you want to add a check box.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted a <form> tag, follow the steps in the 
“Creating HTML Forms” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the Check Box icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Check Box.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input 
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See the sidebar “Making 
forms accessible,” to find out more about these options.)
 
3. Repeat Step 2 to place as many check boxes as you want.
 
4. Select one of the check boxes on your form to reveal the check box 
properties in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 12-3.

324
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
Figure 12-3: 
Check box 
properties.
 
 
5. In the Checkbox Name text box, type a name.
 
 Use a distinct name for each check box because users can select more 
than one check box, and you want to ensure that the information sub-
mitted is properly associated with each individual check box.
 
6. In the Checked Value text box, type a name.
 
 Each check box in a group should have a different Checked Value name 
so that the CGI script can distinguish it. Naming them for the things they 
represent is a good practice. As with radio buttons, the checked value 
is usually included in the data you get back when the form is processed 
and returned to you. If you’re looking at the data later, interpreting it is 
easier if the name is something that makes sense to you.
 
7. For the Initial State option, select Checked or Unchecked.
 
 This option determines whether the check box appears already selected 
when the Web page loads. Select Checked if you want to preselect a 
choice. A user can always override this preselection by clicking the text 
box again to deselect it.
 
8. Select the other check boxes one by one and repeat Steps 5–7 to set 
the properties in the Property inspector for each one.
 
If you want to create a series of check boxes, you’ll find some advantages to 
using the Checkbox Group button in the Insert Form panel.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Adding text fields and text areas
When you want users to enter text, such as a name, an e-mail address, or a 
comment, use a text field. To insert text fields, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a text field.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted a <form> tag, follow the steps in the 
“Creating HTML Forms” section, earlier in this chapter.

325
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
 
 
2. Click the Text Field icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Text Field. A text field box appears.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input 
Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See the sidebar “Making 
forms accessible,” to find out more about these options.)
 
3. On the form, click to place your cursor next to the first text field and 
type a question or other text prompt.
 
 For example, you may want to type E-mail Address: next to a text box 
where you want a user to enter an e-mail address.
 
4. Select the text field on your form to reveal the Text Field properties in 
the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 12-4.
 
Figure 12-4: 
The Text 
Field option 
enables 
users to 
enter text.
 
 
5. In the TextField text box, type a name.
 
 Each text area on a form should have a different text field name so that 
the CGI script can distinguish it. Naming text areas for the things they 
represent is usually best, but don’t use any spaces or special characters 
(other than the hyphen or underscore). In Figure 12-4, you can see that 
I named the text field  hat_size. Many scripts return this name next to 
the contents of the text field a visitor enters at your Web site. If you’re 
looking at the data later, you can more easily interpret it if the name cor-
responds to the choice.
 
6. In the Char Width box, type the number of characters you want visi-
ble in the field.
 
 This setting determines the width of the text field that appears on 
the page. In the example shown here, I’ve set the character width to 
50 to create a text box that is more than wide enough for most e-mail 
addresses. How wide you make your text boxes depends on the amount of 
information you expect users to enter and the constraints of your design.
 
7. In the Max Chars box, type the maximum number of characters you 
want to allow.
 
 If you leave this field blank, users can type as many characters as they 
choose, even if they exceed the physical length of the text box specified 
in the Char Width field.

326
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
  
 I usually limit the number of characters only if I want to maintain con-
sistency in the data. For example, I like to limit the State field to a two-
character abbreviation. Creating drop-down lists, which require users to 
make a selection rather than risking that they might make a typo, is an 
even better way to ensure consistent data. You find instructions for cre-
ating drop-downs in the exercise that follows.
 
 You can set the Char Width field to be longer or shorter than the Max 
Chars field. If users type more characters than can appear in the text 
field, the text scrolls so that users can still see all the text they enter, 
even if it can’t be displayed in the text field all at once.
 
8. Next to Type, select one of the following options:
 
• Single Line creates a one-line text box, such as the kind I created 
for the hat size field shown in Figure 12-4.
 
• Multi Line gives users space to enter text. (Note that if you select 
Multi Line, you also need to specify the number of lines you want 
the text area to cover by typing a number in the Num Lines field, 
which appears as an option when you choose Multi Line.)
 
• Password is used if you’re asking users to enter data that they 
might not want to display on-screen. This type of field causes 
entered data to appear as asterisks and disables copying from the 
field.
 
9. Use the Class drop-down list to apply any class CSS styles that may be 
defined in the site.
 
 You can create class styles for many purposes, including formatting 
form elements. You can read more about creating and applying class 
styles in Chapters 5 and 6.
 
10. In the Init Val text box, type any text you want displayed when the 
form loads.
 
 For example, you can include Add comments here on the form in the 
text field under Comments. Users can delete the Init Val text or leave it 
and add more text in the same text field.
 
11. If you’re creating a multiline text area, specify the Wrap options.
 
 The Wrap field controls how the users’ data is displayed if it exceeds the 
length of the text field. Selecting Off or Default prevents the users’ text 
from wrapping to the next line. (Note this option is available only for 
multiline text boxes.)
 
12. Select the other text areas one by one and repeat Steps 5–9 to set the 
properties in the Property inspector for each one.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.

 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
Creating drop-down lists
When you want to give users a multiple-choice option but don’t want to take 
up lots of space on the page, drop-down lists are an ideal solution. To create 
a drop-down list with Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a drop-down list.
 
 If you haven’t yet created a <form> tag, follow the steps in the “Creating 
HTML Forms” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
 
2. Click the List/Menu icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪List/Menu. A drop-down list appears.
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Input Tag 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See sidebar “Making forms 
accessible,” to find out more about these options.)
 
3. Click to place your cursor next to the List field and enter a question or 
other text prompt.
 
 I typed What state do you live in?
 
4. Select the field that represents the list on your page to reveal the List/
Menu properties in the Property inspector, as shown at the bottom of 
Figure 12-5.
 
Figure 12-5: 
The List/
Menu option 
enables you 
to create a 
drop-down 
list. 
 
5. In the List/Menu text box, type a name.
 
 Each list or menu on a form should have a different name so that you 
can differentiate the lists when the form data is returned.
 
6. Next to Type, select the Menu or List option.
 
 This step determines whether the form element is a drop-down list or a 
scrollable list. If you select List, you can specify the height and control 
of how many items are shown at a time. You can also specify whether 
a user can select more than one item. If you select Menu, these options 
aren’t available.

328
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
7. Click the List Values button, in the upper right of the Property inspector.
 
 The List Values dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
Figure 12-6: 
Create the 
options in 
the List form 
field.
 
 
8. Enter the choices you want to make available.
 
 Click the plus sign (+) to add an item label and then type the label text 
you want in the text box that appears in the dialog box. Item labels 
appear on the menu or list on the Web page in the order in which you 
enter them. Use the minus sign (–) to delete a selected option.
 
 Press the Tab key to move the cursor to the Value side of the dialog box, 
where you can enter a value. Values are optional, but if present, they’re 
sent to the server instead of the label text. This provides a way of includ-
ing information that you don’t want to display on the drop-down list. For 
example, if you enter Alabama as a label on the left, you can enter the 
abbreviation AL as a value on the right. If you enter Alaska as a label, 
you can enter AK as a value, and so on. That way, you visitors can select 
from a list that displays the full name of each state, but your script can 
collect only the two-letter abbreviations. If you don’t enter a value, the 
label is used as the submitted data when the form is processed.
 
 The first label entered in the List Values dialog box is the only one that’s 
displayed on the page until a user clicks the drop-down arrow. Thus, it’s 
good practice to include an instruction in this space, such as Choose a 
State, as shown in the example in Figures 12-5 and 12-6.
Forms display differently in different browsers
Firefox, Netscape, Safari, and Microsoft Internet 
Explorer don’t display text fields in forms 
equally. The differences vary depending on the 
version of the browser, but the general result is 
that a text field appears with different dimen-
sions in one browser than in another. Slight dif-
ferences also exist with color, scroll bars, and 
shape in the case of check boxes. Forms are 
also displayed differently on Macintosh and PC 
computers. Unfortunately, this problem has no 
perfect solution, but as long as your forms look 
okay in the browsers you consider most impor-
tant, it isn’t a problem that they display slightly 
differently in other browsers. For best results, 
test your pages on a variety of browsers and 
on both Macs and PCs, and be especially care-
ful that form fields and other elements aren’t 
cut off.

329
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
 
9. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Finishing your form with Submit 
and Reset buttons
For your users to be able to send their completed forms to you, create a 
Submit button, which, when clicked, tells the user’s browser to send the form 
to the CGI script or other program that processes the form. You may also 
want to add a Reset button, which enables users to erase any information 
they’ve entered if they want to start over.
 
Many developers don’t use the Reset button because they find that it can 
be confusing to visitors (and annoying if it means they accidentally erase all 
the information they just entered). Because visitors can always leave a page 
before clicking the Submit button if they choose not to complete a form, the 
simplest way to avoid this problem is to avoid using a Reset button.
To create a Submit, Reset, or other button in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a button.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted the <form> tag (which appears as a red 
dotted line around your form), follow the steps in the earlier section 
“Creating HTML Forms” before continuing with these steps. You might 
also want to enter at least one text field or other field option. There’s 
not much point in having a Submit button if you don’t provide any fields 
where a user can enter data to be submitted.
 
 
2. Click the Button icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Button. 
 
 If you have accessibility options turned on in Preferences, the Button 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens. (See sidebar “Making forms 
accessible,” to find out more about these options.)
 
 A Submit button appears. 
 
3. Click to select the button.
 
 The Property inspector changes to reveal the form button properties, 
as shown in Figure 12-7. You can change the button to a Reset button or 
other kind of button by altering the attributes in the Property inspector, 
as shown in the remaining steps.

330

properties.
 
 
4. Next to Action, click the Submit Form or Reset Form option.
 
 The Submit Form option invokes an action, such as sending user infor-
mation to an e-mail address. The Reset Form option returns the page 
to the way it was when the page loaded. You can also select the None 
option, which creates a button that can be used for many purposes by 
combining it with a script.
 
5. In the Value text box, type the text you want to display on the button.
 
 You can type any text you want for the label, such as Search, Go, Clear, 
or Delete.
 
Clicking a Submit button in a form doesn’t do much unless you’ve configured 
the form to work with a CGI script or other program to collect or process user-
entered data.
Using jump menus
Many designers use jump menus as navigational elements because they can 
provide a list of links in a drop-down list without taking up lots of room on a 
Web page. You can also use a jump menu to launch an application or start an 
animation sequence.
To create a jump menu, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag where you want to 
add a jump menu.
 
 Alternatively, you can create a jump menu anywhere on a page. If there 
is no form tag in place, Dreamweaver automatically adds one around the 
jump menu tag.
 
 
2. Click the Jump Menu icon on the Forms Insert bar.
 
 You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Jump Menu. The Insert Jump Menu 
dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Text field, under Menu Items, type the name you want to dis-
play in the drop-down list.
 
 Click the plus sign (+) to add more items. As you type items in the Text 
field, they appear in the Menu Items list, as shown in Figure 12-8.

331
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
 
4. Click the Browse button to locate the page you want to link to or type 
the URL for the page in the When Selected, Go to URL field.
 
 You can link to a local file or enter any URL to link to a page on another 
Web site, and you can use the Browse button to specify the URL you 
want to link to.
 
Figure 12-8: 
When you 
create a 
jump list, 
items you 
type in the 
Text field 
appear in 
the Menu 
Items list. 
 
5. If you’re using frames, use the Open URLs In field to specify a target.
 
 If you’re not using frames, the default is Main Window. When the user 
selects an option, the new page replaces the page he or she is viewing. 
(I explain how to target links in frames in Chapter 8.)
 
6. If you want to enter a unique identifier for this menu, use the Menu ID 
field.
 
 This option can be useful if you have multiple jump menus on a page. 
You can use any name you want, but you can’t use spaces, special char-
acters, or punctuation.
 
7. If you want to force users to click a button to activate the selection, 
select the Insert Go Button after Menu option.
 
 If you don’t add a Go button, the linked page loads as soon as the user 
makes a selection. The Go button works like a Submit button for the 
jump menu options.
Understanding How CGI Scripts Work
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are programs written in a program-
ming language, such as Perl, Java, C++, ASP, or PHP. They work in tandem 
with your Web server to process the data submitted by a user. Think of CGI 
scripts as the engine behind an HTML form and many other automated 

332
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
features on a Web site. These scripts are much more complex to create than 
HTML pages, and these languages take much longer to figure out than HTML. 
CGI scripts reside and run on the server and are usually triggered by an 
action a user takes, such as clicking the Submit button on an HTML form.
A common scenario with a script may go like this:
 
1. A user loads a page, such as a guest book, fills out the HTML form, and 
clicks the Submit button.
 
2. The browser gathers all the data from the form and sends it to the Web 
server in a standard format.
 
3. The Web server takes the incoming data and hands it off to the CGI 
script, which unpacks the data and does something with it, such as plac-
ing the data in an e-mail message and sending the message to a specified 
e-mail address or adding the data to a Web page where guest book com-
ments are posted.
 
4. The CGI script then sends instructions or a block of HTML back to the 
browser through the Web server to report on the outcome of the script 
and to complete any final actions, such as displaying a Thank You page.
Configuring your form 
to work with a script
After you create a form using the features covered in the previous sections 
of this chapter, configure the form to work with a CGI script or a program. To 
help you understand how this process works, I use the common formmail.
pl script in the following exercise. This clever little script is designed to col-
lect data entered into an HTML form and send it to a specified e-mail address. 
You can find out more about formmail.pl at www.scriptarchive.com (a 
great place to find lots of free CGI scripts).
Every script is different, and the details of how you install and configure each 
script depend on the program and how your server is set up.
If your service provider doesn’t offer a form mail script, you can download 
and configure the script if you have the right access on your server and 
knowledge of how your server is configured. Ask your service provider for 
more information. If your service provider doesn’t provide the interactive 
scripts you want, you may want to consider moving your site to a hosting 
service that does provide CGI scripts you can use.

333
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
The following exercise shows you how to use Dreamweaver with the form
mail.pl script. This gives you a good introduction to how you’d set up any 
form to work with any script, but be aware that you may have to alter some 
of the steps to work with the program you’re using:
 
1. Select the <form> tag that surrounds your form by clicking anywhere 
on the red dotted line that represents the boundary of the <form> tag 
or by clicking the <form> tag in the tag selector at the bottom of the 
work area, as shown in Figure 12-9.
 
 With the <form> tag selected, the Property inspector changes to feature 
the form tag options. Note: All HTML forms must be enclosed by the 
<form> tag. If your script doesn’t have a <form> tag, add one around 
the entire contents of your form by following the steps in the “Creating 
HTML Forms” section found earlier in this chapter.
 
 To select the <form> tag in Dreamweaver, place your cursor anywhere 
in the body of your form and then use the tag selector at the bottom of 
the work area to select the <form> tag. Make sure you’ve selected the 
<form> tag and not just one of the form elements, such as the text box I 
created in this form for comments.
 
Figure 12-9: 
You can 
use the tag 
selector to 
select the 
<form> tag 
and display 
form 
properties in 
the Property 
inspector.
 

334
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
2. In the Property inspector, give your form a name.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically gives each form you create a distinct name 
(form1, form2, and so on), but I prefer to change the name to something 
that has more meaning, such as contact for this contact form. You can name 
your form whatever you like but don’t use spaces or special characters.
 
3. Specify the action for the form.
 
 For the formmail.pl script used in this example (as well as many 
other scripts you might use), the action is simply the path to the script’s 
location on your server. In Figure 12-10, you can see that I’ve entered 
the address /cgi-bin/formmail.pl. The address you enter depends 
on your service provider, but a common convention is to call the folder 
where CGI scripts are stored cgi-bin. The last part of the address 
(formmail.pl) is the name of the script. In this case, it’s a Perl script, 
indicated by the .pl extension.
 
 You can only use the Browse button (the yellow folder icon in the 
Property inspector) to automatically enter an address in the Action field 
if you’re working on a live server and Dreamweaver has identified the 
location of your script, or if you have the script on your local system in 
the same directory structure that exists on your server. In most cases, 
however, it’s simplest just to ask your service provider or programmer 
for the address and type it in the Action field.
 
Figure 12-10: 
In the 
Action field, 
enter the 
path to the 
script.
 
 
4. In the Method field, use the drop-down arrow to choose Get, Post, or 
Default.
 
 Again, what you choose depends on your script, but Dreamweaver’s 
default is Post. If you’re using a script, such as formmail, which is fea-
tured in the final sections of this chapter, the best option is Post.
 
 The Get option is generally used for nondestructive, safe form transac-
tions that may be repeated, such as a search engine. Transactions with 
the Get option are generally stored in the log files on a server and in a 
browser’s history files, so this option isn’t recommended for sensitive 
data, such as financial information. The Post option is generally used for 
transactions that occur only once, such as sending an e-mail with the 
data from a form, registering for a service, or unsubscribing to a news-
letter. Post can also handle larger chunks of data than Get.

335
 Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
 
5. Click the Target option to specify what the browser does when the 
submit action is completed.
 
 If you choose _blank, the results page opens in a new browser window. If 
you leave this field blank, the browser window is simply replaced with the 
results page. A results page is usually a simple HTML page with a message, 
such as Thanks for playing, delivered when the Submit button is clicked.
 
6. Use the Enctype field to specify how the data is formatted when it’s 
returned (see Figure 12-11).
 
 For example, if you’re using a form mail script, the Enctype field deter-
mines how the text appears in your e-mail when the contents of the form 
are sent to you. By default, this field in blank.
 
Figure 12-11: 
Enter a 
type in the 
Enctype 
field. 
 
7. Use the Class field at the far right of the Property inspector to apply a 
CSS style to the form.
 
 In this example, I applied CSS to some of the elements in the form, such 
as the text, but not to the entire form.
That takes care of all the options in the Property inspector. You still need to 
insert a hidden form field into this form to make it work with the formmail.
pl script, as shown in the next exercise.
Using hidden fields
Many scripts, including the formmail.pl script, require the use of hidden fields. 
Hidden fields are used for data you want associated with a form but not shown to 
visitors to a site, such as the e-mail address to which a form is sent when a visitor 
clicks the Submit button. To insert and use a hidden field, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag.
 
 If you haven’t yet inserted the <form> tag (which appears as a red 
dotted line around your form), follow the steps in the first exercise in 
the “Creating HTML Forms” section before continuing with this exercise.
 
 Even though the hidden field doesn’t appear in the form area, make sure 
that it’s inside the <form> tag before you add a hidden field. Placing 
your cursor at the top or bottom of the form area before inserting a 

336
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
hidden field is a good option because it makes the hidden field easier to 
find in the HTML code.
 
 After the hidden field is inserted into the <form> tag, the Property 
inspector changes to feature the hidden field options.
 
2. In the Property inspector, enter a name.
 
 If you’re using formmai.pl, you’d enter recipient as the name and the 
e-mail address where you want the form data sent as the value. You can 
even enter more than one e-mail address, separated by commas. So, for 
example, I could enter janine@jcwarner.com, janine@digitalfamily.com in 
the Value field, and the data from the form would be e-mailed to both these 
e-mail addresses when a user clicks the Submit button. See Figure 12-12.
 
Figure 12-12: 
The Hidden 
Field 
properties.
 
 
3. Click to place your cursor inside the <form> tag and then click the 
Hidden Field icon in the Forms Insert Bar to add another hidden field 
to create a subject line.
 
4. In the Property inspector, enter the name subject; in the Value field, 
include a subject line you want inserted into the e-mail message auto-
matically when a user submits the form.
 
 In this example, I entered Contact Information from DigitalFamily.com 
as the value.
 
 You can add many other hidden fields to a form, depending on the script 
you’re using and how much you want to customize the results.
That’s it. Assuming all fields are filled in correctly and the formmail.pl 
(or a similar) script is properly installed and configured on your server, you 
should receive via e-mail any data a user enters into your form and submits.
There are so many reasons to create forms on the Web, but e-mailing the con-
tents of a contact form is one of the most common. I hope this little exercise 
has helped to give you an idea of what you need to do to make your HTML 
forms interact with a CGI script on your server.
Remember, most service providers offer a collection of scripts you can use 
for common tasks, such as discussion boards and guest books. All you have 
to do is create the HTML part of the form and then specify the form fields to 
interact with the script on your server. Check the Web site of your Web host-
ing service for instructions specific to the scripts available on your server.

Creating AJAX Features with Spry
In This Chapter
 Creating drop-down menus
 Creating collapsible and tabbed panels
 Working with Spry validation widgets
I
f you still think AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is just something 
you can use to clean the house, you’re missing out on one of the great-
est innovations in Web design. On the Internet, AJAX combines JavaScript 
and XML to create highly interactive features, such as drop-down menus and 
panels that can be opened and closed without reloading a Web page.
To make it easier to create these advanced features, Dreamweaver CS4 
includes a collection of widgets known as the Spry Framework. Even if you 
don’t know how to write JavaScript, XML, or CSS, you can use to Spry add 
AJAX features to your Web pages, such as drop-down menus (like the one 
shown in Figure 13-1), collapsible and tabbed panels, and form validation fea-
tures, which I cover in this chapter.
Making Magic with AJAX
Web designers are all a buzz about AJAX because it makes it possible to 
create pages that are more interactive and faster to load than was possible 
with previous Web technologies. One of the biggest changes is the ability to 
add features that a Web page visitor can change without having to reload the 
entire page.
For example, at the highly popular iGoogle page of the Google search engine 
(available at www.igoogle.com), AJAX makes it possible to open and close 
it and to add and remove content boxes. Thanks to AJAX, Google users can
 
 Create highly customized pages that feature things like weather from 
their local area. 

338
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 Do things like delete the box that features CNN news headlines and 
replace it with headlines from another news source. 
 
 Click and drag content boxes to change their location on the page. 
Although iGoogle is a very advanced example of AJAX, it’s a great example of 
what’s possible.
Dreamweaver’s Spry features are designed to make it easy to create some of 
these basic features, such as panels that open and close the way the weather 
content box on iGoogle opens or closes.
To save you from having to write the code for these kinds of features your-
self, Dreamweaver includes a collection of widgets that instantly adds things 
like collapsible panels to your pages and combines them with editing tools 
that make it easy to customize them. To view the list of AJAX widgets avail-
able in Dreamweaver, open the Spry Insert panel by choosing Spry from the 
Insert panel drop-down menu shown in Figure 13-2.
 
Figure 13-1: 
You can 
create 
drop-down 
menus like 
these with

Creating Drop-Down Menus with AJAX
An increasingly popular option for navigation bars, drop-down menus make 
it possible to provide a menu (or list) of links to the main sections of a Web 
site, with a secondary menu of links to the sub-categories within those sec-
tions. You can even create a third layer with the Spry Menu Bar widget.
 
With the Dreamweaver Spry Menu Bar, you can create menus that span hori-
zontally or vertically. The process works the same for both. As you see in the 
following steps, you simply choose which way you want the menu to span 
when you insert it from the Spry menu.
To create a drop-down menu with the Spry Menu Bar widget, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Place your cursor on a page where you want the menu to appear.
 
 If you haven’t already saved your page, make sure you save it before 
adding Spry features because Dreamweaver will prompt you with a 
warning message that you need to do so.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Menu Bar.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Menu Bar icon in the Spry Insert 
panel, (visible in Figure 13-3).
 
 The Spry Menu Bar dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-3.

340
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
3. In the Spry Menu Bar dialog box, choose Horizontal or Vertical.
 
 Horizontal creates a menu that drops down into a page; Vertical creates 
a menu that opens out to the right.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 A menu with four items and several sub-items is created and inserted 
into the page.
 
5. Enter your own text for the menu items.
 
 You can edit the text for the top-level items in the main workspace by 
simply clicking and dragging to select the generic text, such as Item1, 
and then typing to replace it.
 
 In general, it’s best to make changes to menu bar items in the Property 
inspector, as described in the remaining steps of this exercise. To 
change formatting options, such as color, font face, and size, make 
changes to the style sheet rules, described in Step 14.
 
6. Click the blue Menu Bar tab at the top left of the menu bar to display 
the settings in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
 You find settings to add, remove, edit, and change the order of items 
and sub-items in the Property inspector.

Bar tab to

7. To change the name of an item or subitem, click to select the item in 
the Property inspector and then type a new name in the Text field on 
the far-right side of the Property inspector, as shown in Figures 13-3 
and 13-4.
 
8. To link a menu item, select the item name and enter a URL in the Link 
field or click the Browse button (which looks like a file folder), and 
select the page you want to link to (see Figure 13-4).
 
9. To remove an item, select it and then click the minus (–) sign at the 
top of the field in the Property inspector.
 
 A deleted item is removed from the menu in the Property inspector as 
well as the main work area.
 
10. To add an item, select the plus (+) sign at the top of the item field in 
the Property inspector.
 
 When you add an item, it appears in the Property inspector menu as 
well as in the menu bar in the main work area. (See Step 11 for how to 
change an item name.)
 
11. To add a sub-item, select the item you want the sub-item to appear 
under and then click the plus (+) sign in the item box to the right of 
the selected item (refer to Figure 13-3).
 
12. To change the order of items, click to select an item name and then 
use the arrows at the top of each item box.
 
 Items move up and down the menu when you click the up or down 
arrows. Items appear in the Web page in the order they appear in the 
Property inspector.
 
13. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 You must upload these files to your Web server when you upload the 
Web page for the Spry features to work.

inspector

342
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
14. To change the appearance of a drop-down menu, edit the correspond-
ing CSS style rules.
 
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) style rules determine the text size, font, 
background color, and other formatting features. When you create a 
menu bar, a collection of CSS styles are generated automatically and 
saved in an external CSS file dubbed SpryMenuBarHorizontal.CSS 
(for horizontal menus) or SpryMenuBarVertical.CSS (for verti-
cal menus). You can access these styles through the CSS Styles panel, 
shown in Figure 13-5.
 
 Here are a few examples of how Spry menu bar styles can be edited:
 
a. To change the font size or face, double-click the style name 
ul.MenuBarHorizontal and alter the corresponding Type cate-
gory settings. In the example, shown here, I’ve changed the font 
size to 80 percent, which will make the text in the menu display at 
80 percent of the size of the default text setting for the page.
 
b. You can remove or edit the border of a menu bar by editing the 
border settings in the style ul.MenuBarHorizontal ul. (In the 
example shown here, I removed the border by simply deleting all 
of the settings for the border.)
 
c. You can change the text and background colors for the

 To find other settings you may want to change, click to select each 
of the style names in the Spry Menu Bar style sheet and use the CSS 
Properties pane, in the lower half of the CSS Styles panel, to view the rules 
that have been defined for each style. By simply clicking through the 
collection of styles, you can identify each of the settings in a drop-down 
menu (or any other spry feature) and determine where you’ll need to edit 
them to change the appearance of each element. You find more detailed 
instructions for creating and editing style rules in Chapters 5 and 6.

Creating Collapsible Panels
The Spry Collapsible Panel option makes it easy to add panels that can be 
opened or closed on a Web page. This AJAX feature enables you to make 
better use of the space on a page by making it easy to display more informa-
tion in less space within a browser window.
In Figures 13-6, you can see how I used collapsible panels to contain the biog-
raphy of each partner and consultant in a consulting firm. The result is that 
you can easily see the names of all the consultants on one page. To view a 
consultant’s bio, a user need only click the tab at the top of the panel (where 
the consultant’s name appears) and the panel opens instantly. In Figure 13-6 
you can see that the bio for Designer Davi Cheng is open while the others on 
the page are all closed. The beauty of AJAX is that the page doesn’t have to 
be reloaded for the panels to open or close. Click once on a tab and a panel 
opens instantly. If a user clicks the tab again, the panel closes. Collapsible 
panels can be used to display text and images. You can also include multime-
dia files in panels, such as audio, video, and Flash files.
 
When you create collapsible panels with the Spry menu in Dreamweaver, 
you can set the panels so that they’re closed or opened when a page is first 
loaded. Because each panel is created separately, you can create a page that 
displays all panels open, all panels closed, or a mix of the two options.

Follow these steps to create a collapsible panel:
 
1. Place your cursor on a page where you want the collapsible panel to 
appear.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Collapsible Panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Collapsible Panel icon in the Spry 
Insert panel, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
 A Spry collapsible panel appears in the page, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
3. Click and drag to select the word Tab and replace it with the text you 
want to appear in the panel’s Tab area.
 
 By default, the text in the Tab area is bold, but you can change that by 
altering the corresponding CSS rule.
 
4. Click to select the word Content in the main area of the panel and 
enter any text or images you want to display.
 
 You can copy text into a panel by pasting it just as you’d paste text 
anywhere else on the page. Similarly, you insert images into panels just 
as you would anywhere else on a page by choosing Insert➪Image and 
selecting the GIF, JPEG, or PNG file you want to display.

 When you paste text into a panel, choose Edit➪Paste Special to choose 
the amount of formatting you want to preserve in the text you paste 
in Dreamweaver. Limiting the amount of formatting preserved can cut 
down on potential style conflicts.
 
5. Click the blue Spry Collapsible Panel tab at the top of the panel to dis-
play panel settings in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
 When you correctly click the blue tab, the settings immediately appear 
in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 13-7. Click anywhere else 
on the page, and the inspector returns to its default settings.
 
6. From the Display drop-down menu in the Property inspector, choose 
Closed.
 
 The Closed option immediately closes the panel in the main workspace 
in Dreamweaver. This setting only affects the way the panel displays in 
the Dreamweaver workspace.
 
7. From the Default State drop-down menu in the Property inspector, 
choose Closed.

346
Part III: Making It Cool with Multimedia and JavaScript 
 
 This setting controls how the panel displays in a Web browser. Choosing 
Closed means the panel is closed when the page loads. If you choose 
Open, the panel appears open when the page is loaded.
 
8. Make sure the Enable Animation check box is selected if you want the 
panel to open and close when a user clicks the tab.
 
9. To change the appearance of the panel, such as the font face or color, 
edit the corresponding CSS rule.
 
 For example, to edit the background color of the tab, or the font face, 
style, or color, select the .CollapsiblePanelTab style and alter the 
settings in the Properties panel in the lower half of the CSS Styles panel, 
as shown in Figure 13-8. Alternatively, you can double-click any style 
name to launch the CSS Rule Definition dialog box to make your changes 
there. You find more detailed instructions for creating and editing styles 
in Chapters 5 and 6.
 
10. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 
You must upload these files to your Web server when you upload the 
Web page for the Spry features to work.

 Chapter 13: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
Creating Tabbed Panels
The Spry Tabbed Panel option makes it easy to add a series of panels that 
display or hide content corresponding to a series of tabs, as shown in Figure 
13-9. Similar to the collapsible panels, this AJAX feature lets you display more 
information in less space within a browser window.
Similar to the collapsible panels, tabbed panels can be used to display text, 
images, and multimedia.
 
When you create tabbed panels with the Spry menu in Dreamweaver, you can 
control the order of the tabs, effectively controlling what content appears 
when the page is first loaded.
Follow these steps to create a tabbed panel:
 
1. Place your cursor on a page where you want the tabbed panel to 
appear.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Tabbed Panels.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Tabbed Panels icon in the Spry 
Insert panel, as shown in Figure 13-10.
 
 A Spry tabbed panel appears on the page, as shown in Figure 13-10.

3. Click and drag to select the word Tab in the main workspace and 
replace it with the text you want to appear in the panel’s Tab area.
 
 You can edit the contents of the tabs only in the workspace, not in the 
Property inspector.
 
 By default, the text in the Tab area is bold and black, but you can change 
that by altering the corresponding CSS rule.
 
4. Click the blue Spry Tabbed Panels tab at the top of the panel set to 
display the settings in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 13-10.
 
 When you correctly click the blue tab, the settings immediately appear 
in the Property inspector, as shown in Figure 13-9. Click anywhere else 
on the page, and the Property inspector returns to its default settings.
 
5. To add tabs, click the plus (+) icon in the Property inspector, as shown 
in Figure 13-10.
 
 New tabs appear in the workspace.
 
6. To change the order of tabs, click to select the tab name in the 
Property inspector and then use the arrows in the Panels field to 
move the panel.

349
 Chapter 13: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
 
 Panel names move up and down the menu as the order is changed. 
Panels and their corresponding tabs appear in the Web page in the 
order they appear in the Property inspector.
 
7. Use the Default Panel drop-down menu to choose the panel you want 
to display when the page is first loaded into a Web browser.
 
 The drop-down menu corresponds to the names you give each tab in the 
workspace.
 
8. To add content, select the word Content in the main area of any 
selected tab panel and enter text, images, or multimedia.
 
 You can copy text into a panel by pasting it just as you’d paste text 
anywhere else on the page. Similarly, insert images into panels just as 
you would anywhere else on a page by choosing Insert➪Image and then 
selecting the GIF, JPEG, or PNG file you want to display. You can also 
add multimedia, such as Flash video files. (Find instructions for adding 
multimedia to Web pages in Chapter 11.)
 
9. To change the appearance of a tab or a panel, such as the font face or 
color, edit the corresponding CSS rule, shown in Figure 13-11.
 
 For example, to edit the background color of the tabs, click to select the 
.TabbedPanelsTab style and alter the settings in the Properties panel 
in the lower half of the CSS Styles panel. Alternatively, you can double-
click any style name to launch the CSS Rule Definition dialog box to 
make your changes there. You find more detailed instructions for creat-
ing and editing styles in Chapters 5 and 6.
  
 In tabbed panels styles, the tab background colors are controlled by two 
different styles — the .TabbedPanelsTab and the .TabbedPanels
TabSelected styles. As a result, you can specify a different background 
color and other formatting settings to distinguish the tab that’s selected 
from the tabs that aren’t selected.
 
10. Choose File➪Save to save the page, and when the Copy Dependent 
Files dialog box appears, click OK to automatically generate all the 
related files.
 
 You must upload these files to your Web server when you upload the 
Web page for the Spry features to work.

Using Spry Validation Widgets
The Spry menu also includes a collection of validation widgets for validating 
data that visitors enter into forms on your site. For example, you can use the 
Text Field Validation widget to verify whether a visitor has filled in a speci-
fied minimum number of characters — a handy way to ensure that someone 
has filled in all the digits in a phone number or social security number. You 
can also add hints to a text field to provide additional instructions.
Similarly, you can use the Validation Checkbox widget to verify that a check 
box has been selected. This is common, for example, when you have a legal 
disclaimer or contract and want to ensure that a visitor selects the Accept 
box before progressing into another area of your site.
To use these widgets, first create an HTML form (find instructions for creat-
ing form elements in Chapter 12). Then you can add Spry validation, such as 
the Validation Checkbox, which I cover in this exercise.
To use the Spry Validation Checkbox Wizard to require that users select one 
or more check boxes on a Web page, follow these steps:

351
 Chapter 13: Creating AJAX Features with Spry
 
1. Select the check box where you want to add Spry validation.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Spry➪Spry Validation Checkbox.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Spry Validation Checkbox icon in the 
Spry Insert panel.
 
3. Specify validation requirements in the Property inspector.
 
 When you add a validation widget to a form element, such as the check 
box shown in this example, the Property inspector automatically dis-
plays the properties for that validation option. If those properties aren’t 
visible, click the blue Spry tab just above the form element to display 
them.
 
4. To require that users select a check box, choose Required from the 
Preview States drop-down menu in the Property inspector, as shown 
in Figure 13-12.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically adds Please Make a Selection, just to the 
right of the check box in the workspace. You can edit this text by select-
ing it in the workspace and typing any message you want, such as, You 
must accept our policy to continue.
 
 The validation message displays only if a visitor fails to select the check 
box before clicking the Submit button (which is labeled Send in Figure 13-12).

related files.
 
 For the Spry features work, you must upload these files to your Web 
server when you upload the Web page.
 
 
6. Click the globe icon at the top of the workspace to preview your work 
in a browser where you can test the validation features.

Part IV
Working with 
Dynamic Content

In this part . . .
T
he most sophisticated and technically complicated 
Web sites are created using databases to dynamically 
generate Web pages — ideal for content-heavy Web sites. 
Although creating a Web site with these advanced fea-
tures is far more complex than using methods you find in 
earlier parts of this book, the rewards can be worth the 
trouble. In Chapters 14 and 15, you discover the benefits 
of creating a dynamic site, find out how to work with a 
database on the Web, and follow step-by-step instructions 
to build a simple database-driven site.

Chapter 14
Building a Dynamic Web Site: 
Getting Started
In This Chapter
 Defining a dynamic Web site
 Going over the basic terminology
 Choosing the dynamic development technology
 Setting up your computer for dynamic Web pages
 Creating a data connection
T
he most sophisticated Web sites on the Internet, such as Amazon.com 
or CNN.com, were created using complex programming and databases. 
Combining a database that records information about users with the capabil-
ity to generate pages automatically is what enables Amazon to greet you by 
name when you return to its site, track your orders, and even make recom-
mendations based on your previous purchases.
Static Web sites, which you can build using the instructions in the rest of this 
book, work well for many Web sites (including my own at www.JCWarner.
com). But for anyone creating a really large, content-heavy site, such as a 
magazine or a newspaper Web site or large e-commerce sites where you need 
to track inventory and want users to be able to search through products, 
dynamic Web sites are a better choice.
Before you even start down this path, let me warn you of two things. First, 
creating a dynamic Web site is far, far more complex than creating the 
kinds of static page Web sites described in the earlier chapters of this book. 
Second, the most sophisticated sites on the Web, such as Amazon and CNN, 
use highly customized systems that require teams of very experienced pro-
grammers to create.

356
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
That said, Dreamweaver does include dynamic development features that 
you can use to create database-driven Web sites more easily than if you had 
to write all the code manually. In this chapter and Chapter 15, you find an 
introduction to these features and instructions for creating a basic, database-
driven site.
A description of the more advanced Dreamweaver database features is beyond 
the scope of this book. If you want to use Dreamweaver’s most advanced 
database features, find more information in Dreamweaver CS4 All-in-One Desk 
Reference For Dummies, by Sue Jenkins, Michele E. Davis, and Jon A. Phillips; or 
Dreamweaver CS4 Bible, by Joseph Lowery (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
This chapter begins by introducing you to what people mean when they talk 
about dynamic Web sites and databases, and it explores the many ways in 
which, through a dynamic Web site, you can display and edit information 
contained in a database. You also discover what you need to have in place to 
create a dynamic Web site. In Chapter 15, you find step-by-step directions for 
creating various dynamic features for a simple real-world Web site.
Understanding the Dynamic Web Site
A dynamic Web site is connected to a data source, such as a database, which 
can deliver data to each Web site visitor based on his or her requests. 
Because data is delivered dynamically, it’s possible to provide different con-
tent to each visitor on a Web site in response to actions or information gath-
ered from a visitor.
A simple example of a dynamic Web site feature is a search engine:
 
1. You type what you want to find into a search field.
 
2. When you submit your request, that information is passed to a database.
 
3. The database then returns a list of instant results with information that’s 
relevant (ideally, anyway!) to your search request. Thus information 
entered by a visitor results in a unique, dynamically-generated Web page 
with the results of the search.
 
The easiest way to add a simple search engine to a Web site (even a static-
page site) is Google’s free search engine, which lets you add advanced search 
features using Google’s technology for free. Visit www.google.com/coop/
cse for details.

357
 Chapter 14: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started
Checking out dynamic site advantages
A dynamic Web site has many advantages beyond the ability to create a site-
wide search. Suppose that you have a Web site where you sell 657 kinds of 
candy. Here’s how a static versus a dynamic site might work:
 
 On a static Web site, you’d have to create 657 pages, one for each 
candy product. If you ever wanted to change the way those pages look, 
you’d have to change all 657 pages.
 
 With a dynamic Web site, you create just one page with the design for 
your candy products and then you add special code that dynamically 
pulls product name, image, description, and any other pertinent infor-
mation from a database and displays it in that one page design each time 
a visitor requests one of the 657 kinds of candy.
When you compare the two, dynamic Web sites clearly offer advantages to 
site owners who have a lot of data, such as items for sale, to display in a con-
sistent format:
 
 A dynamic site saves lots of time because you don’t have to create all 
those individual pages.
 
 Dynamic Web sites also enable you to make changes and updates with 
less effort.
 
 Dynamic sites enable you to display the same product information in 
different combinations in different page designs. So, for example, you 
could create one page that displayed only the name and photo of each 
kind of candy and then another page that displayed all the product infor-
mation, including a detailed description, pricing information, and so on.
 
 Dynamic sites enable you to automatically create links between pages 
with related information so that visitors can drill down to find the 
details they want. When you set up your dynamic site, you can create 
features that automatically set the links from the first page with many 
kinds of candy listed to the second, and when a visitor clicks the name 
of a type of candy, a page with all the details of that candy is generated 
dynamically and returned to the visitor.
 
 You can also use AJAX to link dynamic content, such as an XML file, to 
a Web page and display data dynamically. Either way, you store all your 
product information in a data source, such as a database or XML file, 
and then you use special code in the Web page to communicate with the 
data source, collect each product’s information, and create a page on-
the-fly as visitors request products (or any other kind of content).

358
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
Seeing a dynamic site in action
To better understand how dynamic sites work, here’s an example of a 
dynamic Web site in action:
 
1. Point your browser to www.poweryoga.com.
 
2. On the home page, hover your mouse over the About Yoga menu item 
and click Library of Articles.
 
 On the Library of Articles page, you can see the headline and first para-
graph of each of a series of articles about Yoga (see Figure 14-1).
 
 The Library of Articles page is generated dynamically by pulling just 
this first part of each story out of the database and displaying them in a 
specified order on this page.
 
3. Click a headline and the browser displays a page that shows you the 
entire article, drawn from the same database.
 
 When you view pages like this, keep in mind that there’s really only one 
page design for all the articles linked from the library page. When you 
click a headline on the Library of Articles page, as shown in Figure 14-1, 
the system pulls the article from the database, inserts it into the page, 
and displays it in the Web browser.
 
Figure 14-1: 
The 
PowerYoga.
com Library 
of Articles 
page.
 

359
 Chapter 14: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started
 
4. Click the Back to Articles menu button or click the Back button in 
your browser to return to the Library of Articles page.
 
5. Click another headline, and the system pulls that article and displays 
it in the same article page.
 
 Not only does this mean you only need one page for all the articles, it 
also means you only need one copy of each article. So, for example, if 
you find a typo in the headline on the Library of Articles page and you 
correct it in the database, the headline is corrected automatically on the 
Library of Articles page, as well as on the page that displays the entire 
article because it’s the same headline, entered once in the database, and 
displayed as many times as it’s requested on different pages of your site.
Creating Dynamic Sites: Key Concepts
One of the first things you need to understand about creating dynamic Web 
sites is that you need one program to create the data source (usually a data-
base or an XML file) and then you need another program (or programming 
language, such as PHP or ASP.NET) to connect the data source to your Web 
pages. In the two sections that follow, you find a list of some of the most 
common database programs you might use, such as Access and MySQL, as 
well as a description of the five technologies Dreamweaver supports for cre-
ating dynamic sites: PHP, JSP, ASP, ASP.NET, and ColdFusion.
Understanding databases
First, you need to understand what a database is and how tables are struc-
tured. A database is a collection of information compiled in one or more 
tables. Each table has multiple records (or rows) organized in fields (or 
columns).
If this is all new to you, an analogy may help you appreciate how tables and 
columns work. Picture a mail-order catalog, such as the one used by the 
home furnishing store Pottery Barn. From the smallest element (the fields) to 
the largest element (the database), here’s how the elements in this catalog fit 
into the parlance of a database:
 
 Consider that each product has an item number, a price, and a color. 
Think of each of those elements of a product as a field.
 
 Each product is a record in the database. A record in a database consists 
of one complete set of all fields.

360
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
 Taking it a step further, within the catalog, the various products are 
organized in categories, usually because they have something in 
common, such as all the fuzzy things that are designed for the floor 
might be in a rugs category whereas all the things with legs might go 
best in the furniture category (you get the idea). Think of each of the 
categories (furniture, rugs, and so on) as a table — a grouping of records 
from a database that have something in common.
 
 Think of the catalog itself as the database, which contains a collection of 
information about various products.
Okay, so that’s a very simple description of a database, but it’s important 
that you understand the way databases are structured because how a data-
base is set up and how information is organized within tables and rows 
affects how you can organize that content on a Web page.
 
When I refer to a table in a database, I’m not talking about the same kind of 
table discussed in Chapter 7. HTML tables are used to format information, 
much as you’d use a spreadsheet program, such as Excel. Database tables 
aren’t used for formatting; they’re used for grouping and organizing content. 
Just to make things even more confusing, one of the few legitimate uses of 
HTML tables these days is for formatting the contents of a database when it’s 
displayed on a Web page.
Databases can be created with a variety of different programs, including 
Microsoft Access, FileMaker Pro, SQL Server, MySQL, FoxPro, and Oracle. On 
the simpler side, Access is commonly used to create small databases (files 
with a .mdb extension) like the contact database featured in Chapter 15. 
Access is also commonly used to communicate with bigger databases, such 
as Microsoft SQL Server. At the other extreme, a site like Amazon.com, which 
has millions of products stored in a database, would probably use an Oracle 
database or an SQL Server.
To keep things simple in this introduction to dynamic sites, I created the 
database example used in Chapter 15 in Microsoft Access, but the basic con-
cepts and the features in Dreamweaver are similar no matter which database 
application you use.
Choosing a dynamic 
development technology
After you have the data source covered (database or XML files), find a way 
for the Web site and the data source to communicate. That’s where server 
technologies, such as PHP, come in.

361
 Chapter 14: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started
Dreamweaver supports five server technologies (described in detail in the 
following sections):
 
 Active Server Pages (ASP)
 
 ASP.NET
 
 JavaServer Pages (JSP)
 
 ColdFusion
 
 PHP (which stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor — a recursive acro-
nym, for you wordsmiths)
The examples in this book use ASP mostly because it’s one of the simpler 
options to set up on your computer and it provides an easy place to start, 
but in essence, all five offer similar functionality. After you see how Dream-
weaver works with ASP, you’ll have a pretty good introduction to how 
Dreamweaver works with the other four options as well:
 
 They all provide the capability to generate HTML dynamically.
 
 They all can be used to connect your Web site to a database or other 
data source.
 
 With server-side code, they all can display information from a database 
and create HTML based on certain criteria, such as the actions or data 
entered by a visitor to your site.
I don’t recommend any one technology over another. They all offer similar 
functionality with slight variations in speed and efficiency. One consideration 
that is important — make sure that your Web host supports whatever tech-
nology you choose. Not all Web servers are set up to handle all these tech-
nologies. The following descriptions are designed to help you make a more 
informed decision about which option best serves your needs.
ASP
Extension: .asp
Although ASP has been replaced by ASP.NET, it’s still used by many active 
sites on the Web. ASP is a server technology built into the Windows 2003 
Server, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and Windows Vista 
at no additional cost. ASP can also be used with Microsoft IIS (Internet 
Information Services) or Personal Web Server, which is useful for build-
ing and testing on your local hard drive. ASP isn’t a standalone program-
ming language because much of the code you write for ASP pages is in 
VBScript or JScript (Microsoft’s version of JavaScript). You can check out 
www.4guysfromrolla.com to find out more about ASP in what more 
closely resembles plain English.

362
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
For the examples in this book, I chose ASP, mostly because it’s much easier 
to set up than any of the other technologies. After you see how the basics 
work with ASP, you can graduate to other options, such as PHP or ASP.NET. 
Consider the examples in this chapter and Chapter 15 as an introduction to 
dynamic site design. I don’t want to throw you into the deep end (at least, 
not yet).
Warning: Even with ASP, which is a relatively simple option, the example 
steps in this chapter and Chapter 15 get a lot more technical than the earlier 
chapters in this book.
ASP.NET
Extension: .aspx
ASP.NET is Microsoft’s replacement for ASP. ASP.NET isn’t just a revision of 
ASP 3.0; it’s a complete redesign of the language. Microsoft has done more 
than add new tags. The language is similar to traditional programming lan-
guages, such as C++, where code is compiled. This arrangement suggests 
that applications written in ASP.NET can run faster because Web servers 
work more efficiently with less coding overhead. However, ASP.NET isn’t as 
verbose as ASP 3.0, so it’s much harder for novice programmers to read. ASP.
NET is a Microsoft technology, and you can find more information at msdn.
microsoft.com/asp.net and www.asp.net.
ColdFusion
Extension: .cfm
ColdFusion, owned by Adobe, uses its own server and scripting language. 
ColdFusion is probably the easiest language to figure out how to use because 
it includes custom tags that also enable you to separate dynamic code from 
HTML, which makes it similar to JSP. Also like JSP, it’s ultimately based on 
Java. But the many tags included in ColdFusion make it much easier and 
faster to use than technologies like Java or PHP. ColdFusion also includes 
built-in XML processing. You can read more about ColdFusion at www.
adobe.com/products/coldfusion.
JavaServer Pages (JSP)
Extension: .jsp
JSP is from Sun Microsystems. Because its dynamic code is based on Java, 
you can run JSP pages on non-Microsoft Web servers. You can use JSP on 
Allaire JRun Server and IBM WebSphere. With JSP, you can create and keep 
the dynamic code separate from the HTML pages, or you can embed the JSP 
code into the page. Unless you’re a hardcore programmer, however, this lan-
guage isn’t for you. JSP is horribly complex. You can find out more about JSP 
at java.sun.com/products/jsp.

PHP
Extension: .php
PHP is an open source technology so it’s free, which has helped make it one 
of the most popular options for creating dynamic Web sites. PHP is often 
used with databases created with MySQL and many commercial Web hosting 
services provide MySQL and PHP support as part of their standard Web host-
ing services. PHP is native to UNIX-based servers. However, you can down-
load Windows binaries from www.php.net to run Apache (a server software 
typically used with PHP) from any version of Windows as well as IIS (Internet 
Information Services) on NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and 
Windows 2003 Server. You can even configure PHP to run on Personal Web 
Server (although doing so is tricky). The PHP scripting language is based on 
C, Perl, and Java. You can get more functionality with PHP right out of the 
box than you can with ASP. For example, virtually every ASP add-on that’s on 
sale at www.serverobjects.com comes built-in or is available for free from 
www.php.net.
 
If you’re working with PHP and MySQL, here’s a great way to get a testing 
server set up on your local computer. The Webserver on a Stick (WOS) is 
available for free from www.chsoftware.net/en/useware/wos/wos.htm. 
According to the site: you can use this service to run a Web server based on 
Apache, MySQL and PHP from an USB Stick. Other writable media (your hard 
drive, flash drives, and so on) also work. You need to be running Windows.
Creating dynamic pages with AJAX (using Spry)
AJAX combines the power of Asynchronous 
JavaScript and XML to create dynamic features 
that can be changed in a Web browser without 
ever reloading the page from the Web server. 
The Adobe Spry Framework in Dreamweaver is 
designed to make it easier to create AJAX fea-
tures. Spry widgets are ready-to-use, common 
Web page components that can be customized 
with CSS. Dreamweaver includes a collection 
of Spry widgets designed for creating advanced 
features, such as drop-down menus, collapsible 
panels, and tabbed panels. (All three features 
are covered in detail in Chapter 13.)
Spry can also be used to create pages that 
feature dynamically-generated content. For 
example, you can combine a Spry widget with 
a data source, such as an XML file. You can 
see some cool examples of Spry at http://
labs.adobe.com/technologies/
spry/demos.

Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
Setting Up Your Computer to 
Serve Dynamic Web Pages
When you’re creating dynamic sites, you can’t just preview your dynamic 
pages the way you can preview the pages from static Web sites. Remember a 
static Web site is made up of individual pages, each of which must be altered 
and uploaded separately to a Web server, and each of which can be viewed 
separately in a Web browser. When you create a static site, you can easily 
preview your pages directly from your local hard drive. When your content 
is dynamic, previewing your pages isn’t that simple because you need a 
Web server to process the page and create it dynamically before it can be 
displayed in a Web browser. Thus, you need to have Web server software on 
your local computer to view dynamic pages.
Fortunately, a number of servers can be installed for free and can be used to 
mimic the functions of the kind of Web server that will host your site when 
it’s published online.
 
Web server is commonly used to describe both a piece of computer hardware 
on which a Web site is stored (usually a high-powered computer) and the 
software on that computer that provides the server functionality. To test 
your dynamic pages in Dreamweaver, you need  Web server and application 
server software (although in some cases you can get both in one). If you can 
run Dreamweaver CS4, your personal computer should be more than powerful 
enough to act as a Web server.
In the sections that follow, I show you how to set up a simple Web server 
on a Windows computer and how to make a few other adjustments to your 
system so that you can preview your pages on your local computer.
To set up a Web server, you need server software. A Web server responds 
to requests from a Web browser by serving up Web pages based on those 
requests. You also need to set up an application server, which helps the Web 
server process specially marked Web pages. When the browser requests one 
of these pages, the Web server hands off the page to the application server, 
which processes the page before sending it to the browser. One of the advan-
tages of working with ASP is that the IIS server, which I use in the examples in 
this chapter and the next, can handle both functions.
 
Don’t skip these next two sections because you can’t complete the example 
tasks that follow if you haven’t first set up a local Web server and set the 
proper permissions on your local computer.

365
 Chapter 14: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started
Setting up a local Web server
When you use ASP, you have a choice of Web server options. Both Microsoft 
IIS and Personal Web Server (PWS) work for testing your ASP pages and both 
can serve as a Web server and an application server. PWS runs with Windows 
XP and Windows Vista; you can install either from your Windows CD. If you 
have Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista 
(Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions), IIS is part of the package. If you 
can’t find your CD, you can download IIS or PWS for free from the Microsoft 
Web site.
 
IIS doesn’t work on Windows XP or Vista Home editions. You must upgrade to 
use these advanced features.
If you’re running an edition of Vista or Windows XP that supports IIS, all you 
have to do is make sure it’s enabled by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Start menu and choose Control Panel.
 
2a. Vista: Choose Programs to open the Programs and Features dialog 
box, and then choose Turn Windows Features On or Off from the left 
side of the dialog box.
 
 If you’re prompted with a dialog box that states Windows Needs Your 
Permission to Continue, click Continue.
 
2b. XP: Click the Add or Remove Programs option in the Control Panel 
and then click the Add/Remove Windows Components button on the 
left side of the Add or Remove Programs window.
 
 On XP, the Windows Components Wizard dialog box opens. On Vista, 
the Windows Features dialog box opens.
 
3a. XP and Vista: Scroll down in the Windows Features dialog box until 
you find the Internet Information Services option (as shown on Vista 
in Figure 14-2) and select the check box.
 
 In the boxes under IIS, make sure that ASP and ASP.NET are checked.
 
3b. XP: Scroll down in the Windows Components dialog box until you find 
the Internet Information Services option and select the check box.
 
4a. Vista: Click OK.
 
4b. XP: Click Next.
 
 A dialog box appears explaining that configuring the components can 
take several minutes. The dialog box closes automatically when the 
components are configured.

 If you didn’t install these components when you first installed your 
operating system, you may be prompted to insert your original Windows 
software disk (or the setup disk that came with your computer) so that 
these components can be added.
 
5. Click to close the Programs and Features folder on Vista or the Add or 
Remove Programs window on XP.
 
6. To test to make sure that the IIS server is functioning properly, open a 
Web browser, such as Firefox, and enter the URL http://localhost.
 
 If you’re using Vista, the localhost page appears in the browser, as 
shown in Figure 14-3. Click a link in the language of your choice for more 
information about IIS.
 
 If you’re using XP, a message appears in red in the Web browser stating, 
Your Web Service Is Now Running. This page also provides additional 
information about IIS.
 
If you don’t have your Windows CD, you can download IIS from the Microsoft 
Web site and install it separately.

Setting up permission
The next challenge to getting your computer set up to build and test your 
database-driven site locally has to do with the way Windows handles permis-
sions on a computer. Most Windows operating systems have security fea-
tures that limit how computer users can access certain features or folders on 
your hard drive. If you’re using a Windows operating system, your hard drive 
probably uses Microsoft’s security-conscious New Technology File System 
(NTFS) format. For the database examples in the following chapters to work, 
make some changes to the permission settings on your computer.
You also want to copy or move your database and any other files you have 
ready for your Web site into a special wwwroot folder on your operating 
system. The Inetpub and wwwroot folders are created automatically when 
you install IIS. Changing permissions on these folders and copying your files 
into them before you set up your site is a relatively simple, and very impor-
tant step, covered in the exercise that follows.

368
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
It’s important that you store the database and the other files for your Web site 
in the wwwroot folder because this is what IIS considers the root level of your 
local Web server. You need your site in the wwwroot folder for your pages to 
preview properly in a Web browser on your hard drive. However, by default, 
Windows protects this folder, so before you can work on your site in this 
folder, you have to change the security settings.
 
Another important step in creating a database-driven site is, not surprisingly, 
that you have to create a database. How you create a database is way beyond 
the scope of this book. For the purposes of the following exercises and 
the ones in the following chapter, I created a simple contact database with 
Microsoft Access. If you don’t yet have a database file and just want to follow 
along, you can download this database file (contacts.mdb) from my Web 
site at www.digitalfamily.com/dwd.
I created this file in Microsoft Access because it’s an easy database program 
to use and one that many readers are likely to already have, but you don’t 
need Access to use this file with Dreamweaver. You can’t edit any of the 
contact names or other data in the database file without Access or a similar 
program, but you can use this file to follow along with the exercises in this 
chapter and Chapter 15 as you try Dreamweaver’s database features.
Follow these steps to copy your files into the wwwroot folder and set up per-
missions in Windows:
 
1. Choose Start➪Computer.
 
 The My Computer folder opens with a list of your hard drives.
 
2. Double-click the C: drive, double-click the Inetpub folder, and then 
right-click the wwwroot folder and choose File➪Properties.
 
 The Properties dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Security tab and then click the Edit button.
 
 The wwwroot Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
4. Click the Edit button under the Group or User Names list.
 
 The Permissions for wwwroot dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-5.
 
5. Select Users (COMPUTER\Users) from the Group or User Names list.
 
6. In the Permission for Users box, select the Full Control Allow check 
box, as shown in Figure 14-5.
 
 A check mark appears automatically in each of the check boxes in the 
dialog box.
 
7. Click Apply, click OK, and click OK again to close these dialog boxes.
 
8. Create, copy, or move a folder into the wwwroot folder to serve as 
your main local root Web site folder.

 As shown in Figure 14-6, I copied the myContacts folder into the www-

base file and an images folder. You can call your main site root folder 
anything you like, but it’s best not to use spaces or special characters, 
and the files for your site need to be stored in this wwwroot folder for 
the local Web server to be able to display your dynamic pages on your 
hard drive.

Creating a Data Connection 
in Dreamweaver
Creating the data connection in Dreamweaver takes a few quick steps. Start 
by setting up your site’s local information and remote site information and 
then establish a connection between the site and the data source.
In this example, I assume that you’ve completed the steps in the previous 
two sections, that you’re running IIS on the same computer as Dreamweaver, 
that you’ve stored your data source in the wwwroot folder, and that you’ve 
changed permissions so that you can write to that folder on Windows. All 
these steps are crucial to your ability to set up a local connection, which I 
cover in this section.
To set up a dynamic site in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Site➪New Site.
 
 The Site Definition dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab.
 
 The Advanced window appears. If you prefer, you can use the Basic 
Wizard that steps you through the setup process, but I find it faster and 
easier to view all the options at once on the Advanced tab.
 
3. In the Category box on the left, make sure that the Local Info category 
is selected.
 
4. In the Site Name text box, type a name for your site.
 
 You can call your site whatever you like; this name is used only to help 
you keep track of your sites in Dreamweaver. Many people work on 

371
 Chapter 14: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started
more than one Web site, and the name you enter here is the name you’ll 
choose from the drop-down list in the Files panel or the Manage Sites 
dialog box. In the example shown in Figure 14-7, I named the new site 
myContacts.
 
 
5. Click the Browse icon (which looks like a file folder) next to the Local 
Root Folder text box and browse your hard drive to locate the www-
root folder where you saved the files for your dynamic site.
 
 If you haven’t copied the database and any other files you’ll be using in 
your site into the wwwroot folder yet, exit the Site Definition dialog box, 
copy the files into the wwwroot folder, and start these steps over from 
the beginning.
 
6. Specify the Default Images Folder by entering the location or using 
the Browse icon (which looks like a file folder) to locate it.
 
 This works just like the previous step, you simply want to browse to the 
images folder and select it so that Dreamweaver can identify the loca-
tion. You can create a new folder for your images when you select it, but 
again, this folder must be located within the wwwroot folder.
 
7. For Links Relative To, choose Site root, as you see in Figure 14-7.
 
 This setting controls how the path is set in links. When you’re working 
with dynamic content, Site Root is the best option.
 
Figure 14-7: 
When work-
ing with 
dynamic 
content, 
set Links 
Relative To 
to Site Root.
 

372
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
8. In the HTTP Address text box, type the URL of your local Web server.
 
 On most computers, if you’re using IIS, the local URL for the Web server 
is http://localhost followed by the name of your root site folder. 
In this example, you’d enter http://localhost/myContacts, as shown in 
Figure 14-7.
 
9. Select the Enable Cache option.
 
 Dreamweaver creates a local cache of your site to quickly reference the 
location of files in your site. The local cache speeds up many site man-
agement features of the program and takes only a few seconds to create.
 
10. Click the Testing Server category on the left side of the dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 14-8.
 
 The Testing Server options are opened in the Site Definition dialog box.
 
11. From the Server Model drop-down list, choose the server technology 
you’re using for your site.
 
 In this example, I’m using ASP JavaScript, as shown in Figure 14-8. You’ll 
find a complete list of the technologies supported by Dreamweaver in 
this drop-down list.
 
12. From the Access drop-down list, choose Local/Network.
 
 Again, I’m assuming that you’re testing and developing your site on your 
local drive or on a local area network.
 
13. Click the Browse button (which looks like a folder) and then locate 
and select the wwwroot folder.
 
 If you’re using a different server technology, such as ColdFusion, the 
root folder may be in a different location.
 
14. Enter the URL for the local Web server in the URL Prefix field.
 
 As shown in Figure 14-8, in this example, the URL is the same as the URL 
entered into the Local Info settings, http://localhost/
myContacts/.
 
15. Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box and save your settings.
 
 If the folder you selected as your local site folder already contains files 
or folders, they’re automatically cached and all the files and folders in 
your site are displayed in the Files panel.

To establish a connection to a data source in Dreamweaver, make sure 
you’ve completed all the steps in the previous three sections and then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The New Document dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-9.

2. Choose the Blank Page icon from the left.
 
3. In the Page Type list, click ASP JavaScript.
 
 If you’re working with a different server technology, such as ColdFusion, 
make sure you choose the corresponding page type.
 
4. Under Layout, choose a layout option.
 
 For this example, I choose the CSS Layout 1 Column Fixed, Centered, 
Header, and Footer.
 
5. Click Create to automatically create a new page and close the New 
Document dialog box.
 
6. Choose File➪Save, name the file, and save it in your root folder.
 
 Because this will be the main page of my ASP site, I named the file 
index.asp.
 
7. With your new page open, choose Window➪Databases to open the 
Databases panel, as shown in Figure 14-10.
 
 
If the Databases panel is already open in the workspace, you can simply 
double-click to open the panel and then click the Databases tab.
 
8. Click the plus sign (+) at the top of the Databases panel and select 
Custom Connection String from the list, as shown in Figure 14-10.
 
 The Custom Connection String dialog box opens (see Figure 14-11).
Figure 14-10: 
The Custom 
Connection 
String set-
tings are 
available 
from the 
Databases 
panel.
 

375
 Chapter 14: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started
 
9. Enter the name for the new connection.
 
 In this example, I entered myContacts. You can call the connection any-
thing you like, but it’s best not to use spaces or special characters in the 
name.
 
10. Type the connection string (see Figure 14-11).
 
 This part gets a little tricky depending on which technology you’re 
using. If you’re using ColdFusion, you can use the Browser button and 
simply locate the database file in your local root folder. ASP.NET has a 
similar feature, but with some of the technology options, such as ASP, 
which I’m using in this example, you need to type in the string manu-
ally based on the data source you’re using and the location of your root 
folder.
 
 For this example, I’m using the Microsoft Access driver installed on 
my computer and an MS Access database at c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\
myContacts\contacts.mdb with the appropriate permissions set 
in Windows. With this as the case, I typed the following into the box 
exactly as you see it here (make sure to include the space between Data 
and Source, the quote marks, and the semicolon at the end): 
“Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\
myContacts\contacts.mdb;”
 
 If you’re using another database option, alter this string accordingly.
 
11. Click the Test button.
 
 A pop-up message appears, letting you know that the connection was made 
successfully, and your database is now listed in the Databases panel. If the 
connection isn’t successful, review the string carefully for typos.
 
 When Dreamweaver creates the connect, it also creates a Connections 
folder, which is displayed in the Files panel. The Connections folder 
contains an ASP file with the connection information for the database. 
Again, if you’re using another technology, this file has a different name 
and extension. Dreamweaver automatically references this file on any 
page you create that uses this database connection, saving you from 
inserting it every time.
 
Figure 14-11: 
The Custom 
Connection 
String dialog 
box.
 

376
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
The ASP files in the Connections folder store necessary information that 
makes your page work correctly with the database. Make sure that you upload 
this folder when you upload your site files to the server. Also note that if your 
Web server is configured differently than your hard drive, you may need to 
adjust this connection string to work properly on your Web server. Check 
with your system administrator or hosting service about where database 
files need to be stored and how connection strings need to be set up on your 
server.
 
If your connection fails, check your Custom Connection String again and 
check the URL prefix for the application server. You can also check the 
Dreamweaver Help Index for other troubleshooting tips.
Now you’re ready to build a dynamic Web site. In Chapters 15, you can start 
putting these great Dreamweaver features to use by adding content from this 
database to a Web page.
Setting up Dreamweaver for Mac users
Setting up a data connection on a Mac is a 
little more complicated because you can’t run 
one of Dreamweaver’s support Web servers 
or application servers locally unless you’re 
running OS X; you must connect to a remote 
server. Ideally, you can connect your Mac to 
an NT server with permission to browse the 
Mac. After you’re networked, make the data 
connection. Dreamweaver includes information 
in its Help files that specifically covers this pro-
cess for Mac users.
OS X users can alternatively download 
Apache’s HTTP server from http://httpd.
apache.org.

I
f you’ve never used the dynamic development capabilities of 
Dreamweaver, get familiar with the windows and inspectors covered at 
the beginning of this chapter before you start creating your first project. In 
the rest of this chapter, you find out how these elements work together to 
create a Web site with dynamic features.
For the purpose of illustration, I use a simple Contacts database file, created 
with Microsoft Access, that features information about a few people — 
names, addresses, and pictures. If your site features another type of data, 
such as product descriptions or articles, don’t worry — you’ll add product 
names and descriptions to a Web page in much the same way I add names 
and titles from this Contacts database. Consider this a simple introduction to 
Dreamweaver’s dynamic site features and remember that you can use these 
same steps to create any kind of dynamic Web site.
 
Make sure your test server is running and, because this chapter assumes that 
you’re using Internet Information Server (IIS) or Peer Web Services (PSW) for 
Windows, make sure that you save all the pages as ASP pages (filename.
asp) so that the server parses the code correctly. If you haven’t already set 
up the application server and established a connection to your database in 
Dreamweaver, go to Chapter 14 and follow the instructions for these crucial 
preliminary steps before you do the exercises in this chapter.

378
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
Exploring the Panels
In Dreamweaver, the most fundamental elements of creating a dynamic Web 
site are in the Application panel, which includes the Databases, Bindings, 
Components, and Server Behaviors panels. In this section, I introduce you to 
these panels to give you an overview of how these panels work together to 
help you create a dynamic site.
The Databases panel
The Databases panel lets you look at the databases on your application 
server. In the Databases panel, you can view your entire database structure 
within Dreamweaver — tables, fields, views, and stored procedures — with-
out needing to use separate database software.
 
You can find the Databases panel by choosing Window➪Databases.
In Figure 15-1, you see that a connection has been established to the Contacts 
database and that you can view all the fields in that database by clicking the 
plus (+) sign next to Contacts.
If you have not yet established a connection to a database, go to Chapter 
14 where you find instructions for creating a connection with a Custom 
Connection String using the Databases panel.
 
Figure 15-1:

Databases 
panel dis-

database.
 

379
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
The Bindings panel
The Bindings panel enables you to add and remove dynamic content data 
sources from your document. The number and kinds of available data 
sources can vary depending on whether you use ASP, JSP, or any other 
server technology. A data source is where you get information to use on your 
dynamic Web page. An example of a data source is a recordset from a data-
base, which you explore further in the next few sections of this chapter. A 
recordset is used to hold a collection of data from a database. After you create 
a recordset, the data can be displayed on a Web page.
 
If you don’t see the Bindings panel, you can open it by choosing 
Window➪Bindings.
With the Bindings panel, you can access data sources in several ways. You 
can find out what data source objects you have available by clicking the plus 
sign (+) in the Bindings panel to display the Add Bindings pop-up menu (see 
Figure 15-2).
 
Figure 15-2: 
The Add 
Bindings 
panel and 
its pop-up 
menu.
 
The Add Bindings pop-up menu has the following options:
 
 Recordset (Query): A recordset stores data from your database for use 
on a page or set of pages. I explain recordsets in more detail later in this 
chapter.
 
 Command (Stored Procedure): Commands, or stored procedures, are 
reusable database items that contain SQL (Structured Query Language) 

380
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
code and are commonly used to modify a database (insert, update, or 
delete records).
 
 Request Variable: Commonly used wherever a search is involved, a 
request variable carries information from one page to another. When you 
use a form to submit data to another page, a request variable is created.
 
 Session Variable: Session variables store and display information for the 
duration of a user’s session (or visit). A different session is created on 
the server for each user and is kept in use either for a set period of time 
or until a specific action on the site terminates the session (such as a 
logging out).
 
 Application Variable: Application variables store and display informa-
tion that must be present for all users and is constant throughout the 
lifetime of an application. These types of variables are commonly used 
for page counters or date and time counters. Application variables are 
available only for ASP and ColdFusion pages, not for PHP and JSP.
 
 Spry Data Set: Spry data sets link existing XML files to display with any of 
the various Spry widgets.
 
 Get More Data Sources: Use this option to open Dreamweaver Exchange 
in your browser. You can use Exchange to download extensions for 
Dreamweaver. You find instructions for downloading and installing 
extensions in Chapter 10.
The Server Behaviors panel
Server behaviors are server-side scripts that perform some type of action. 
Through the Server Behaviors panel, you can add server-side scripts, such as 
user authentication and record navigation, to your pages. Server behaviors 
available to you vary depending on the server technology you use.
 
You can get to the Server Behaviors panel by choosing Window➪Server 
Behaviors.
You can view the available server behaviors by clicking the plus sign (+) in 
the Server Behaviors panel to get the Server Behaviors pop-up menu (see 
Figure 15-3).
The Server Behaviors pop-up menu has the following options:
 
 Recordset (Query): A recordset stores data from your database for use 
on a page or set of pages. I explain recordsets in more detail later in this 
chapter.
 
 Command: Commands are reusable database items that contain SQL 
code and are commonly used to modify a database (insert, update, or 
delete records).

381
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
 
 Repeat Region: This server object displays multiple records on a page. 
Repeat Region is most commonly used on HTML tables or HTML table 
rows. You can find out more about this behavior later in this chapter.
 
 Recordset Paging: If you have to display a large number of records and 
want them to appear a page at a time, this set of behaviors allows you to 
navigate from page to page or from record to record.
 
 Show Region: With this set of server behaviors, you can show or hide 
record navigation based on the records displayed. For instance, if you 
have Next and Previous links on the bottom of every page and your user 
is on the first page or first record of the recordset, you can set a behav-
ior to display only the Next link. The same is true if the user is on the 
last page or record — you can set the behavior to hide the Next link and 
display only the Previous link.
 
 Dynamic Text: This option enables you to display information from your 
recordset anywhere on the page.
 
 Go to Detail Page: With this behavior, you can link each record in your 
repeated region to a detail page for that particular record. The behavior 
also tells the detail page which record’s information to display.
 
 Go to Related Page: You can use this behavior to link a particular 
dynamic page to another page that contains related information, passing 
the parameters of the first page to the related page.

Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
 Insert Record: Use this behavior on a page to add new records to a data-
base via a Web browser.
 
 Update Record: Use this behavior on a page to update existing records 
in a database via a Web browser.
 
 Delete Record: Use this behavior on a page to permanently delete a 
record from a database via a Web browser.
 
 Dynamic Form Elements: This set of server behaviors turns text fields, 
list or menu fields, radio buttons, or check boxes into dynamic form ele-
ments, which you can set to retrieve and display particular information 
from a recordset.
 
 User Authentication: The User Authentication set of behaviors allows 
you to log in a user, log out a user, check a username against the infor-
mation in your database, and restrict access to a page.
 
 XSLT Transformation: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation 
(XSLT) is a language that displays XML data on a Web page after trans-
forming it into HTML.
 
 Edit Server Behaviors: Use this option to customize or remove existing 
server behaviors. Unless you’re very comfortable with coding or SQL, I 
advise you to not mess with this option. (If you’re curious about SQL, see 
SQL For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Allen G. Taylor; Wiley Publishing, Inc.)
 
 New Server Behavior: Use this option to create new server behaviors 
and add them to the list of existing behaviors. Again, this option is for 
more advanced users who are comfortable with coding.
 
 Get More Server Behaviors: Use this option to open Dreamweaver 
Exchange in your browser. You can use Exchange to download exten-
sions for Dreamweaver. You find instructions for downloading and 
installing extensions in Chapter 10.
The Components panel
Components are reusable bits of code that you can create and insert 
directly into your pages. To open the Components panel, choose 
Window➪Components. In Dreamweaver, you can create components for JSP, 
ColdFusion, and ASP.NET pages to use (or consume) Web services, display 
information, or for any other use that you can imagine.
Creating a Recordset
A recordset holds data from your database for use on a page or set of pages. 
A query gathers information from a database to be used on a page, selecting 
only the records matching the fields and conditions of the particular query. 

383
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
The queries for a recordset are built with SQL, but you don’t need to know 
SQL to get the job done. Dreamweaver writes it all for you.
All you really need to understand is that you can’t add data from your data-
base to your Web pages until you’ve created a recordset.
 
Before you can create a recordset, you must first connect to a database. 
Chapter 14 includes instructions for creating a Custom Connection String, 
which you must do before you can create a recordset.
To define a recordset in Dreamweaver:
 
1. Open the ASP page that will use the recordset.
 
2. In the Bindings panel, click the plus sign and select Recordset 
(Query).
 
 You see the Recordset dialog box.
 
3. In the Name box, enter a name for your recordset.
 
 Usually, adding rs to the beginning of the name is recommended to 
distinguish it as a recordset in your code, but it isn’t necessary. I used 
myContacts, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
4. In the Connection drop-down list, select your connection.
 
 This list includes any data connections defined from the Databases 
panel. Chapter 14 explains how to create a connection.
 
5. In the Table drop-down list, choose a database table where the data 
for your recordset will be collected.
 
 You can select all the columns or only specific columns of data to be 
displayed.
 
6. (Optional) If you want the available information to show only records 
that meet specific criteria, select a filter in the Filter area.
 
7. (Optional) If you want to change the sort order of the displayed 
records, use the Sort drop-down list to specify the field by which you 
want the records sorted (Name, Phone Number, and so on) and then 
specify Ascending or Descending.
 
 If you want to tweak the results further and you feel comfortable working 
with SQL, you can click the Advanced button to edit the SQL statement 
directly.
 
8. To test the connection to the database, click the Test button.
 
 You can find the Databases panel by choosing Window➪Databases. To 
create more complicated recordsets, click the Advanced button and you 
can create SQL statements directly.
 
 If the test is successful, you see a window with the data in the recordset 

384

Recordset 
dialog box.
 
 
9. Click OK to close the Test screen.
 
10. Click OK to complete the Recordset dialog box.
 
 The Bindings panel appears displaying the contents of the recordset. 
You can expand it by clicking the plus sign next to the recordset, as 
shown in Figure 15-5.
 
Figure 15-5: 
The 
myContacts 
recordset

the Bindings

Using a Recordset on Your Page
After you create a recordset, you can place the information on your page as you 
want. For this example, I designed a basic page with a table that has room to list 

385
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
the name, title, country, e-mail address, and phone number of each contact in 
the database. In Figure 15-6, you see my simple page with headings across the 
top of the table, but no content displayed in the table cells.
After you set up the document the way you want it, you can drag and drop 
each data source from the recordset to the place on the page where you want 
the data displayed. To add data from the recordset to your Web page, follow 
these steps:
 
1. From the Bindings panel, select your first data source, such as First 
Name, and drag it onto your page, dropping it where you want it to go.
 
 The name of the dynamic text appears inside curly brackets, as shown 
in Figure 15-7.
 
 
You can format dynamic text just as you would format any other text on 
the page.
 
2. Test the result by clicking the Live View button. 
 
 
 The first record of your database appears in place of the dynamic text, 
as shown in Figure 15-8.
 
To display more than just the first record in a Web page, define and repeat a 
region, which you find out how to do in the next sections.
 
Figure 15-6: 
I created a 
page using 
CSS to

 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
Repeating a Region
One of the greatest advantages of creating a dynamic site like this is the abil-
ity to display any combination of content from more than one record at a 
time on a page. You can do this by applying a server behavior to your region. 
Server behaviors are code blocks that let you add dynamic capabilities to 
your Web site.
 
A region is any area of a page that displays information from a database on 
your page. After you define your region, you can apply a Repeat Region server 
behavior, which causes that area to be written to the page over and over, dis-
playing every record, or as many records as you tell it to on as many pages as 
needed to display all the contents of the database (or whatever subset of the 
database you want displayed). The Repeat Region is most commonly used on 
HTML tables or table rows.
To add a Repeat Region server behavior to your page:
 
1. Select the area on your page that you want to define as a region.
 
2. Click the Server Behaviors panel, click the plus sign (+), and select 
Repeat Region from the menu that appears (see Figure 15-9).
 
 The Repeat Region dialog box appears (see Figure 15-10).
 
Figure 15-9: 
To define 
a region, 
choose 
the Repeat 
Region 
option from 
the Server 
Behaviors 
panel.
 

388
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
3. Select the number of records that you want to appear on the page and 
then click OK (see Figure 15-10).
 
 In this example, I chose to have ten records displayed on the page. If you 
follow the steps in the section “Adding Navigation to a Dynamic Page,” 
later in this chapter, you can set up your pages to automatically display 
any number of records per page and then to automatically link to the 
next and previous pages as pages are created until all the records in the 
database are displayed.
 
4. Click the Live View button to see the results.

Adding a Dynamic Image
If your database only contains text, the preceding section covers all that 
you need to do to display content on your pages. But if you’re like most 
Web designers, you probably want to include photos of the people in your 
Contacts database or images of each product. To do that, you need to do a 
little prep work and then bind an image to a recordset so that you can add it 
to the page.
Preparing to add an image
Before you bind an image so you can add it dynamically, take care of these 
preliminary steps:
 
1. Make sure that you have a field for each record in your database that 
lists the actual path of the image for that record.
 
 For example, if your images reside in an images folder, one level above 
your dynamic page, enter the following in the image field in your data-
base: images/imagename.gif, remembering to replace the imagename.
gif part with the actual filename for each image.
 
2. Make sure your images are in your site root folder in your wwwroot 
folder or, if you’re testing your work on a remote server, make sure 
that you’ve uploaded the images to the root folder on the server.
 
3. Place a placeholder image in the spot where you want an image to 
appear for all the records.

389
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
 
 You can use any of the images in your image folder as a placeholder 
or choose Insert➪Image Object➪Image Placeholder to use the built-in 
image placeholder.
Binding the image
After you insert the placeholder image, you can bind images in two easy 
ways — with the Bindings panel or the Property inspector.
Follow these steps to bind images with the Bindings panel:
 
1. Select your placeholder image in the open document.
 
2. Click the plus sign (+) to expand your recordset. (On a Mac, click the triangle.)
 
3. Select the Picture field in your recordset that contains the name of the 
image file.
 
4. Click the Bind button at the bottom of the Bindings panel.
 
 The image changes to a tree with a lightning bolt along its side, and the 
Src field is automatically filled in the Property inspector.
After an image is bound, the Bind button changes to the Unbind button, as 
shown in Figure 15-11.
 
Figure 15-11: 
Use the 
Bindings 
panel to 
bind an 
image field 
to an image

page.
 

390
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
Follow these steps to bind images with the Property inspector:
 
1. Click to select the placeholder image in the open document.
 
2. In the Property inspector, click the Browse button (which looks like a 
folder) next to the Src field.
 
 The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
 
3. At the very top of the Select File Name From section, click the radio 
button to select the Data Sources option, as shown in Figure 15-12.
 
 The Recordset appears in the Field area (see Figure 15-12).
 
4. Click to select the field that contains your image information.
 
 Dreamweaver automatically fills in the URL field at the bottom of the 
Select Image Source dialog box.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The image changes to a tree with a lightning bolt along its side, and the 
Src field is automatically filled in the Property inspector.
After performing either of these two methods to bind your images to the 
page, click the Live View button to check the results and the images, which 
are displayed in Dreamweaver.

 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
Adding Navigation to a Dynamic Page
If your database contains many records, you’ll likely want to show only a few 
records per page so that you don’t overwhelm the user. You’ll probably also 
want to create a series of pages, linked together, so that it’s easy for visitors 
to view all the records by clicking through a series of pages.
To help you easily automate the creation of a series of pages like this, the 
Server Behaviors panel includes features you can use to add navigation to 
your pages so that visitors can move forward or backward through all the 
pages that display the records from your database.
The first step is to set up a Repeat Region, which I cover in the section, 
“Repeating a Region,” earlier in this chapter. Add navigation only if you’ve 
set up the Repeat Region and you want have enough data to warrant creating 
multiple pages with navigation that will help users move through multiple 
pages. Assuming you have more records than you want on each page, you 
can add button images or text links at the bottom of each page to provide 
navigation, such as Previous Page and Next Page links. With the buttons in 
place, you can activate them by using the Server Behaviors panel.
To add Next and Previous links, follow these steps:
 
1. Add text with the words you want to use for your links to the page 
with the Repeat Regions.
 
 For this example, I simply typed in text, separated by the tilde button, 
like this: First ~ Previous ~ Next ~ Last, as shown in Figure 15-13.
 
2. Click the Server Behaviors tab to open the Server Behaviors panel.
 
 
Alternatively, you can open the Server Behaviors panel by choosing 
Window➪Server Behaviors from the main menu.
 
3. Click and drag to select the text you want to serve as a link.
 
 In this example, as shown in Figure 15-13, I’ve selected Previous.
 
4. At the top of the Server Behaviors panel, click the plus sign (+) and 
select Recordset Paging from the menu.
 
5. From the Recordset Paging submenu, choose the appropriate naviga-
tion option.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 15-13, you can see that I’ve selected the 
text Previous and am applying the Recordset Paging option, Move to 
Previous Record.
 
 The Move to Record dialog box appears and, in most cases, you can just 
click OK because Dreamweaver automatically fills in the fields based on 
the option you selected.

392
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
Figure 15-13: 
For each 
link option, 
select 
Recordset 
Paging and 
choose 
the cor-
responding 
navigation 
option.
 
 
6. Follow Steps 1–5 for each navigation link.
 
7. Choose File➪Preview in Browser to test the links.
 
 Assuming you have your test server set up properly (see Chapter 14 for 
instructions), the page displays in a browser with the dynamic content 
and links in place, and you can page through your records.
That’s a pretty nifty trick. Did you notice that on the first page, the Previous 
Page button or link still appears, even though there’s no previous page? Not 
to worry — a server behavior tells the navigation button when to show up:
 
1. Click the Previous Page button in the Document window to select it.
 
2. Click the plus sign (+) in the Server Behaviors panel and then choose 
Show Region from the menu.
 
3. If you’re working with the Previous Page button, choose Show Region 
if Not First Record. If you’re working with the Next Page button, 
choose Show Region if Not Last Record.
 
 The Show Region dialog box appears. The Move to Record dialog box 
appears and, in most cases, you can just click OK because Dreamweaver 
automatically fills in the fields based on the option you selected.

393
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
 
4. Choose File➪Preview in Browser to display your pages and test these 
new dynamic features.
 
 Notice that now when you’re on the first page of records, the Previous 
Page button doesn’t appear; when you’re on the last page, the Next Page 
button doesn’t appear.
Now that you know how to add navigation to your recordsets, you can get 
fancy and add buttons to go to the first or last record. So if you have, say, 
100 pages of records, you can jump from page 1 to page 100 without clicking 
Previous Page or Next Page through countless other pages of records. The 
server behaviors for those two are Move to Record➪Move to First Record 
and Move to Record➪Move to Last Record. Useful stuff to know.
Creating a Master-Detail Page Set
A master page displays a list of records and a link for each record. When a 
user clicks a particular link, a detail page appears with more information 
about that record.
 
Here are the two types of master pages:
 
 A list of records determined by you: Users can’t alter the list of records 
on this page; they can only click to view more information about those 
records displayed.
 
 A dynamically-created master page: A good example of this type of 
master page is a search results page that appears when a user performs 
a search for specific records.
A detail page is the page that appears when a user clicks a particular link 
from a master page. This page can either display more information about 
a record (such as providing a more detailed description of a product in an 
online catalog), or it can be set up for administrative purposes to provide a 
way for users to update or delete a record.
 
Systems like these that enable users to add or remove records are great ways 
to make it easy for many people to update a Web site, but they’re generally 
restricted to users who have been given password access to a protected sec-
tion of a site.
Creating a master-detail page requires just a few clicks of the mouse. Using 
the functions described earlier in this chapter, create a page that you will 
use to list all your contacts, and name it something like contacts.asp. 
This is your master page. Next, create the page you use as the detail page in 
the same way and call it something like contactDetails.asp. Now you’re 
ready to create the master-detail page set:

394
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
 
1. Open the contacts.asp page you created as the master page and 
choose Insert➪Data Objects➪Master Detail Page Set.
 
 The Insert Master-Detail Page Set dialog box opens (see Figure 15-14). 
The top part of the dialog box is where you define the properties of the 
master page. The bottom part is where you define the detail page.
 
Figure 15-14: 
The Insert 
Master-
Detail Page 
Set dialog 
box.
 
 
2. In the Recordset drop-down list, select the recordset that you use for 
your master page.
 
3. Next to Master Page Fields, use the plus sign (+) and minus sign (–), 
respectively, to add or remove fields from the master page.
 
4. Select the field from which you want to provide a link to the detail 
page for each record.
 
 For example, if you list a bunch of contacts, you can use each contact’s 
name as a link to its detail.
 
5. In the Pass Unique Key drop-down list, the default is usually correct; 
if it isn’t, select the unique identifier that you want to pass on to the 
detail page.
 
6. Select the number of records you want to show at one time on the 
master page.
 
 Showing only a partial listing is okay because you can add navigation to 
view more records.

395
 Chapter 15: Bringing Data into the Mix
 
7. In the Detail Page Name box, type the filename for the detail page or 
click the Browse button to search for the file.
 
8. Just as with the Master Page Fields section, use the plus and minus 
signs (respectively) to add or remove fields that you want or don’t 
want to appear on the detail page.
 
9. Click OK.
Dreamweaver automatically adds all the necessary recordset information and 
SQL code for you to begin using your master-detail page set. Everything from 
navigation to record status is in there.
 
After you create the master and detail pages, you may want to rearrange and 
format the fields. (Dreamweaver just plops the stuff onto the pages, creating a 
generic look.) For example, you can change the column labels to text that has 
more meaning and is friendlier to your visitors. You can also format the font, 
color, and size as well as add padding to the table cells and change the order 
of the columns.
More Ways to Use Database-Driven Sites
This chapter and Chapter 14 were designed to give you a basic introduction 
to what’s involved with creating dynamic Web sites and the range of features 
you’ll find in Dreamweaver that can help make it easier to create dynamic 
Web pages.
If you’ve spent much time on the Web, you know there are many other ways 
to create pages with dynamic data, from shopping carts to blogging tools. 
Yep, that’s right; the same basic concepts illustrated in these two chapters 
are used to create programs like TypePad or WordPress for blogging or to 
create elaborate e-commerce sites.
Creating such advanced dynamic features requires far more instruction and 
experience than I can provide in this book about Dreamweaver, but you 
should know that you can go far beyond what I’ve covered here in the world 
of Web development.
 
You should also know that you don’t need to reinvent the wheel, as they say. 
Many of the most common dynamic site features, such as shopping carts, can 
be purchased, or rented, from people and companies who have spent far more 
time building them than you’ve probably spent reading this book.

396
Part IV: Working with Dynamic Content 
Before you attempt to create your own shopping cart, for example, you might 
want to consider creating a Web store at Amazon.com and simply linking it to 
the site you’ve created in Dreamweaver. Similarly, Google now offers a simple 
Google Checkout button as well as a more elaborate shopping system. You’ll 
find many other shopping cart and e-commerce systems with just a little 
searching on the Web.
Similarly, if you want to set up and manage an online publication and expect 
to have many writers and editors, you may want to consider purchasing a 
good content management system (CMS). Every blogging program is essen-
tially a CMS, but you’ll find content management systems that range from the 
attractive price of free (for example, www.drupal.org), to prices that might 
surprise you because you can literally spend more than seven figures on a 
customized, high-end CMS, the likes of which publications like The New York 
Times rely on.
 
If you’re excited about creating your own dynamic Web site, I encourage you 
to keep learning because there’s so much you can do with Dreamweaver. I 
also want to make sure you know that you can turn to lots of places to find 
high-end features, such as shopping cards, without creating them all yourself. 
To help you keep up with the ever-changing range of options out there, I’ve 
created a resource guide on my Web site, which I update regularly with cool 
programs, services, and such. You’ll find my resource list as well as many 
other tips and tutorials at www.DigitalFamily.com/dreamweaver.

lthough Dreamweaver is a wonderful tool for creating Web sites, it 
can’t handle everything you need to put a site online. For example, you 
can’t register a domain name using Dreamweaver, and when you’re ready to 
publish your site, you’ll need a Web server. I added this chapter to offer you 
a handy list of resources that can help you finish your site when you need to 
go beyond the features in Dreamweaver.
Registering a Domain Name
The address for your Web site is its domain name. The domain name is what 
visitors need to know to find your Web site. For example, you can visit my 
Digital Family Web site at DigitalFamily.com.
Even before you start building your Web site, I recommend that you register 
your own domain name. The process is simple, painless, and costs less than 
$10 per year, but it can take from a few hours to a few days for the domain 
registration process to be completed.
You can register any domain name that hasn’t already been taken by some-
one else, and for free you can check to see whether a domain name is already 
taken. Just visit any domain registrar, such as www.godaddy.com or 1and1.
com, and enter the domain name you want into the search field on the main 
page of the registrar’s site. If the name you want is no longer available, most 
registration services will give you a list of recommended alternatives.

400
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Most domain registration services also provide Web hosting services, but 
you don’t have to host your site at the same place where you register the 
name. You can set up a Web server anywhere you want and then use the 
domain management settings at your domain registration services to point 
your name to the server where your Web site is hosted.
 
When you enter a domain name into a Web browser, everything before the 
extension (the .com, .net, or .org part) can be written in uppercase or low-
ercase, and it will work just fine. However, if you want to go to a specific page 
within a Web site, such as www.DigitalFamily.com/videos, the text that 
comes after the extension is often case sensitive. Because the part before the 
.com doesn’t matter, I find it easier to recognize domain names when they’re 
written with capital letters. So, for example, I use www.DigitalFamily.com 
on my business cards instead of www.digitalfamily.com.
Protecting Your E-mail Address 
from Spammers
Spammers gather millions of e-mail addresses from Web sites every day by 
collecting e-mail addresses from links on Web pages. It’s common practice 
for Web designers to include an e-mail link to make it easy for visitors to 
contact them. Unfortunately, those simple e-mail links make it even easier for 
spammers to gather e-mail addresses automatically.
To help counter this problem, the programmers at AddressMunger.com have 
come up with a special way of “hiding” e-mail addresses from the automated 
bots that spammers use. When you add this special code to your Web pages 
and use AddressMunger to create the e-mail links on your Web pages, your 
visitors can still e-mail you easily, but spammer’s can’t read your e-mail 
address. It’s an easy way to cut down on all that spam in your inbox.
Highlighting Links with Pop-Ups
This innovative online service creates a small pop-up preview of any page 
you link to on your site, like you see in Figure 16-1. You simply sign up (for 
free) at Snap.com and use their online tool to generate special code you can 
copy and paste into the code in your Web pages.

With Snap.com’s unique pop-ups, anytime your visitors roll their cursors 
over a link, a small pop-up window appears with a preview that displays the 
page or site that you’ve linked to from your site. It’s a great way to give visi-
tors a little more information as they peruse your pages and to highlight the 
links on your site.
Selling Stuff on the Web
You can sell things online in many ways. As a general rule, I recommend that 
you start simple and add more complex and expensive options after you 
know that you’ll make money with your site.
At the simple end of the spectrum, you can add a purchase button with the ser-
vices offered at www.PayPal.com or checkout.google.com. Moving up in 
complexity and price, you can create a shopping system at smallbusiness.
yahoo.com/ecommerce. If you want a more custom solution and the ability 
to create your own shopping cart, check out the powerful, highly customiz-
able Dreamweaver-compatible programs at www.WebAssist.com or www.
cartweaver.com.

Keeping Track of Traffic
Most Web hosting services provide basic log reports and traffic information, 
but if you want to know for sure how people are finding your Web site and 
what they’re doing after they get there, consider using a service like Google 
Analytics, StatCounter.com or WebSTAT.com.
To use any of these services, set up an account and copy a bit of code from 
the site into your Web pages. (It’s a simple copy-and-paste procedure you 
can do with code view in Dreamweaver.) StatCounter and WebSTAT then use 
that bit of code to track your traffic.
 
Visit any of the three services I mention in this section for a demo and a 
sample report with all the different kinds of information you can collect, 
including what search terms someone used to find your site through a search 
engine. Studying how people use your Web site is one of the best ways to 
determine how you should continue to develop your content and your design.
 
If you need instructions for how to copy and paste code from a site like 
StatCounter or Google Adsense, see the tutorial on my Web site at www.
DigitalFamily.com/dreamweaver.
Surveying Your Visitors
Want to know what your visitors really think? Ask them. You can create a 
free, online survey at SurveyMonkey.com and link to it from your Web site. 
SurveyMonkey makes it easy to create the survey using a Web browser and 
then automatically tallies the results and presents them in a series of reports 
and pie charts. It’s a great way to impress your board of directors at the next 
annual meeting.
Saving Time with Templates
If you want more predesigned templates than the ones included in 
Dreamweaver, use one of the many third-party companies that create and 
(usually) sell their templates over the Web.
Visit www.dreamweaver-templates.org for a long list of sites that offer 
templates for free or for a fee. Just download and open them in Dreamweaver, 
and you can start building your Web site around these professionally created 
templates in no time.

Keeping Up with Web 
Standards at W3.org
If you want to keep up with the latest developments in Web design and make 
sure you’re following standards, there is no better place than W3.org, the 
official Web site of the organization that sets Web standards. You’ll find 
loads of information on this nonprofit site, including the full specification for 
HTML, CSS, and much more. You can also test your Web pages by entering 
the URL into the CSS validator at jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator, or the 
MarkUp validator at validator.w3.org.
Extending Dreamweaver at Adobe.com
Visit the Dreamweaver Exchange Site at www.adobe.com/cfusion/
exchange/ to find a vast collection of extensions you can use to add behav-
iors and other features to Dreamweaver. It’s easy to install them using the 
Extensions Manager, which I cover in Chapter 10.
While you’re at the site, check out Adobe’s growing collection of tutorials, 
updates, and resources, including the new CSS section, where you’ll find the 
latest in CSS tips, tricks, and workarounds at www.adobe.com/devnet/
dreamweaver.
Dressing Up the Address 
Bar with a Favicon
Have you ever wondered how some sites add a custom graphic to the 
address bar at the top of browsers like Internet Explorer? Google adds a capi-
tal G, Adobe adds its logo, and you can add an image, too. But first you have 
to get the image in the right format.
To convert an image into a Favicon, visit Favicon.com, where you can 
upload a graphic and have it converted for free. Then just add that image to 
the root level of your main site folder, and it automatically displays in the 
address bar of a browser.

A
ll good Web sites grow and evolve. If you start with a strong design and 
pay close attention to some basic rules about interface, navigation, and 
style, you’ll have a better foundation to build on. The following design ideas 
and Dreamweaver tips can help you save time as you create Web sites that 
look great for all your visitors.
Design for Your Audience
No matter how technically sophisticated a Web site is or how great the writ-
ing, most people notice the design first. Make sure that you leave plenty of 
time and budget to develop an appropriate and attractive design for your 
Web site. The right design is one that best suits your audience — and that 
may or may not mean lots of fancy graphics and animations.
Think about whom you want to attract to your Web site before you develop 
the design. A gaming Web site geared toward teenagers should look very dif-
ferent from a Web site with gardening tips for the semiretired or an online 
investment site for busy professionals.

406
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A great way to find ideas is to visit other sites designed for your target 
market, even if they don’t offer the same content, products, or services. As 
you consider design ideas, keep in mind your audience’s time constraints, 
attention span, and goals. If you’re creating a site for busy professionals, you 
may want to include a search engine and lists of links that make it easy to go 
directly to key information. If you’re designing an entertainment destination, 
your audience may be willing to wait a little longer for animation, video, and 
other interactive features.
Create a Consistent Design
Most Web sites work best and are easiest to navigate when they follow a 
consistent design theme. Case in point: Most readers take for granted that 
books don’t change their design from page to page, and that newspapers 
don’t change headline fonts and logos from day to day. Indeed, many people 
would argue that when users say something is “intuitive to use,” what they 
really mean is that it’s familiar. Consistency is one of the primary tools used 
in design to help readers find a site familiar and make it easy to follow a story 
or a series of navigation elements.
When you lay out Web pages, keep in mind that you want viewers to instantly 
understand which pieces of information are related to each other and how 
to move from one area of a Web site to another. Distinguish different kinds of 
information with the following:
 
 Design: Make sure that similar elements follow the same design param-
eters, such as type style, banner size, and page background color. 
Streamlining the number of design elements can also make your site 
more user-friendly: If you use too many different elements on any single 
page or even on the same Web site, you risk confusing your viewers.
 
 To ensure a consistent style, define a set of colors, shapes, or other ele-
ments that you use throughout the site. Choose no more than two or 
three fonts for your Web site and use them consistently too. Using too 
many fonts makes your pages less appealing and harder to read.
 
 Use a new font, color, or other contrasting element only when you want 
to call attention to something special. A little surprise here and there 
can keep your Web site alive.
 
 Location: Keep related items close to one another and be consistent 
about where you locate similar elements. For example, a menu of links 
should appear in the same place on all your pages to make it easier for 
visitors to quickly find their way around your site.
 
 Prominence: Give elements of similar importance the same weight on a 
page. For example, the most important headline on each page should be 
formatted with the same size and style.

407
 Chapter 17: Ten Timesaving Tips
This type of organization makes following information visually much easier.
Follow the Three Clicks Rule
The three clicks rule states that no important piece of information should 
ever be more than three clicks away from anywhere else on your Web site. 
The most important information should be even closer at hand. Some infor-
mation, such as contact information, should never be more than one click 
away. You can make finding information easy for viewers by creating a site 
map (with links to all or most of the pages in your site) and a navigation 
bar — a set of links to all the main sections on your site.
Get a Head Start on Your Designs
Dreamweaver features many predesigned templates, including a collection 
of CSS designs you can edit to create two-column, three-column, and other 
popular CSS layouts.
When you create a file in Dreamweaver (such as by choosing File➪New), the 
New Document window offers you many ways to create a predesigned page, 
including the following:
 
 Template pages: Choose the Template Page category to open a list of tem-
plates types. The options are ASP JavaScript, ASP VBScript, ASP.Net C#, 
ASP.Net VB, ColdFusion, HTML, JSP, and PHP. Note that all these formats 
except HTML require programming and require the most advanced fea-
tures of Dreamweaver. You find more about these options and how they 
can be used to create database-driven Web sites in Chapters 14 and 15.
 
 Layout designs for frames: If you’re going to use frames, get a head start 
with one of Dreamweaver’s many predesigned framesets. Because these 
templates can save you so much time, they’re a “must use” feature if 
you’re creating a site that uses frames.
 
 CSS-designed pages: Choose from any of the predesigned layouts 
included in the New Document window under Layout when you create a 
new file.
 
 Regular template designs: Choose Page Designs to open a list of basic 
HTML templates. Although they may seem simple by comparison, these 
are well-designed pages that can help you get a static Web site up and 
running with a lot less effort than creating it from scratch.

408
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Split the View
If you like to switch back and forth between the HTML source code and 
design view in Dreamweaver, you’ll appreciate the option to split the window 
so that you can view both the source code and the page design at the same 
time. To split the window, choose View➪Code and Design or click the Split 
View button, located just under the Insert bar at the top of the workspace.
Dreamweaver’s source code has helpful color coding and tagging features, 
similar to those in HTML editors such as HomeSite and BBEdit. Notice as 
you’re working that if you select an image, text, or another element on a page 
in design view, it is automatically highlighted in code view, a useful feature 
that makes it easier to find your place in the raw code.
Design in a Flash
Flash rocks! Adobe has made Flash better than ever by providing enhanced 
integration with Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Fireworks. Flash is a vector-
based design and animation program and the tool used to create some of the 
coolest Web sites on the Net today. Flash makes it possible to create fast-
loading images and complex animations that dynamically adjust to fit any 
screen size. Now that the vast majority of Web surfers have the Flash plug-in, 
Flash has become a standard for video and animations, and Dreamweaver 
makes inserting Flash video and animation files easier than ever.
Just choose Insert➪Media, select a Flash option from the list (SWF, Flash 
Paper, or FLV), use the dialog box to customize the Flash file, and save it to 
your Web site. You find detailed instructions for inserting Flash files into Web 
pages in Chapter 11.
Find Functional Fonts
Designers get so excited when they find out that they can use any font on a 
Web page. In reality, your viewers must still have the font on their comput-
ers for the font to appear. The more common the font, the more likely it is to 
appear the way you intend. If you want to use a more unusual font, go for 
it — just be sure that you also include alternatives. The Dreamweaver font 
list already includes collections of common fonts, and you can create your 
own font list by choosing Format➪Font➪Edit Font List.
In an effort to make text easier to read on the Web, Adobe and Microsoft have 
both created fonts especially suited to computer screens. To find out more, 

409
 Chapter 17: Ten Timesaving Tips
visit their Web sites at www.adobe.com and www.microsoft.com, respec-
tively, and search for Web fonts.
Keep Frequently Used Items Handy
Ever wish you could keep all your favorite Dreamweaver features in one con-
venient place? You can! Just customize the Favorites collection in the Insert 
panel. To get started, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Dreamweaver, and choose Window➪Insert to open the 
Common Insert panel.
 
 The Insert panel includes several sections, including Layout, Forms, 
HTML, and Favorites.
 
2. Click the arrow in the Insert panel and choose Favorites from the 
drop-down list.
 
 The Favorites option is at the end of the Insert panel drop-down list.
 
3. To customize the Favorites panel with all your favorite feature 
icons, right-click (or Control+click on a Mac) and choose Customize 
Favorites.
 
 Use the Favorites Insert panel as a convenient way to keep all your 
favorite features handy. You can even change it for special projects that 
require a collection of program features.
Be Prepared for Fast Updates
The Web provides a powerful vehicle for businesses and nonprofit organiza-
tions to present their side of any story and get the word out quickly when 
tragic events, bad press, and other crises arise. But don’t wait for an emer-
gency to find out whether you’re prepared to add new information to your 
Web site quickly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking that just because you 
don’t manage a daily Internet newspaper, you don’t have to worry about 
speedy updates.
With a little planning and key systems set up in advance, you can be pre-
pared for events that require timely information — whether an international 
crisis stops air travel, a flood closes your nonprofit, or an embarrassing 
event makes your CEO cringe and demand that the real story be told as soon 
as possible.

410
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Most organizations develop Web sites that are updated on a weekly, monthly, 
or even annual basis. More sophisticated sites may link to databases that 
track inventory or update product listings in real time, but even high-end 
sites are often ill prepared to update special information quickly.
Here are a few precautions you can take to be prepared for timely updates on 
your site:
 
 Make sure you can send new information to your Web site quickly. 
Many Web sites are designed with testing systems that safeguard 
against careless mistakes, but these systems can add hours, or even 
days, to the time it takes to add new information to your Web site. Work 
with your technical staff or consultants to make sure you can update 
your site quickly if necessary. This may require creating a new section 
that you can update independently from the rest of the site or that can 
override the regular update system.
 
 Make updating important sections of your site easy. Consider building 
or buying a content management system that uses Web-based forms 
to post new information to your site. Such a system can be designed 
to change or add information to a Web page as easily as filling out an 
online order form. You need an experienced programmer to develop 
a form-based update system. Many Web consultants offer this kind of 
service for a reasonable fee. This method works, for example, if you’re 
a real estate agent and need to change listings or if you have a calendar 
of events. Include password protection so that you control access to the 
form. As an added advantage, a form enables you to make updates from 
any computer connected to the Internet, so you can update your Web 
site even if you can’t get back into your office.
 
 Identify and train key staff to update the site. With the right systems 
in place, you don’t need to have much technical experience to make 
simple updates to a site, but your staff needs some instruction and 
regular reminders. Make sure you also develop a schedule for retraining 
to ensure that no one forgets emergency procedures. Your most seri-
ous emergency could happen tomorrow or may not happen for years to 
come — you never know — but being prepared pays off in the end.
Back It Up
Make sure you have a system in place to back up your Web site. Always 
keep a copy of all the files on your server in a separate location and update 
it regularly to make sure you have the latest version of your site backed up 
at all times. Even the best Internet service providers sometimes have techni-
cal problems, so keep a backup of your site where you have easy access to it 
and can get it back online quickly if something deletes any or all the files you 
have on the server.

411
 Chapter 17: Ten Timesaving Tips
Also keep a backup of your original source files, such as Photoshop images. 
For example, when you develop images for the Web, you usually start in 
a program such as Photoshop, creating a high-resolution image that may 
include layers and other elements. Before the image goes on your Web site, 
those layers get flattened and the image gets compressed or reduced and 
converted into a GIF or a JPEG. If you ever want to go back and alter that 
image, you’ll want the original source file before it was compressed and the 
layers were flattened. Whether you create your own images or you hire a 
professional designer, make sure you develop a system for saving all these 
original elements and make sure you get the original files from the designer, 
if possible, so that you have them if you ever need to alter an image later.
