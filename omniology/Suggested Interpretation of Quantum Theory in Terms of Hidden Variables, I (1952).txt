The usual
interpretation
of the quantum
theory
is self-con-
sistent,
but it involves
an
assumption
that
cannot
be tested
experimentally,
ms. , that the most complete possible specification
of an individual
system is in terms of a wave function
that deter-
mines
only
probable
results
of actual
measurement
processes.
The only way of investigating
the truth
of this assumption
is by
trying to find some other interpretation
of the quantum
theory in
terms of at present
"hidden" variables,
which in principle
deter-
mine the precise behavior
of an individual
system, but which are
in practice averaged
over in measurements
of the types that can
now be carried out. In this paper and in a subsequent
paper, an
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory
in
terms
of just
such
"hidden" variables
is suggested. It is shown
that as long as the
mathematical
theory
retains
its present
general
form,
this sug-
gested
interpretation
leads to precisely
the same results
for all
physical
processes as does the usual interpretation.
Nevertheless,
the suggested
interpretation
provides a broader conceptual
frame-
work than the usual interpretation,
because it makes possible a
precise and continuous
description
of all processes,
even at the
quantum
level. This broader
conceptual
framework
allows
more
general
mathematical
formulations
of the
theory
than
those
allowed by the usual interpretation.
Now, the usual mathematical
formulation
seems to lead to insoluble
difhculties
when it is ex-
trapolated
into the domain
of distances
of the order of 10 "cm
or less. It is therefore entirely possible that the interpretation
sug-
gested here may be needed for the resolution
of these difficulties.
In any case, the mere possibility
of such an interpretation
proves
that it is not necessary
for us to give up a precise, rational,
and
objective description
of individual
systems at a quantum
level of
accuracy.
1. INTRODUCTION
HE usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory is
based on an assumption
having very far-reaching
implications,
~is., that
the
physical
state
of an
in-
dividual
system
is completely
specified
by a wave
function that determines
only the probabilities
of actual
results that can be obtained
in a statistical
ensemble
of
similar
experiments.
This
assumption
has
been
the
object
of severe
criticisms,
notably
on
the part
of
Einstein,
who has always
believed
that,
even at the
quantum
level,
there
must
exist
precisely
definable
elements
or dynamical
variables
determining
(as in
classical physics)
the actual behavior
of each individual
system,
and not merely
its probable
behavior.
Since
these elements
or variables
are not now included
in the
quantum
theory and have not yet been detected experi-
mentally,
Einstein
has
always
regarded
the present
form of the quantum
theory as incomplete,
although
he
admits its internal
consistency. '
~
Most physicists
have
felt that
objections
such
as
those raised by Einstein are not relevant,
first, because
the present form of the quantum
theory with its usual
probability
interpretation
is
in
excellent
agreement
with an extremely
wide range of experiments,
at least
in the domain
of distances'
larger than 10 " cm, and,
secondly,
because no consistent
alternative
interpreta-

a thorough
summary
of the
entire
controversy.
6 At distances of the order of 10 "cm or smaller
and for times
of the order of this distance
divided
by the velocity
of light or
smaller, present
theories become so inadequate
that it is generally
believed
that they are probably
not applicable,
except perhaps
tions have as yet been suggested.
The purpose
of this
paper (and of a subsequent
paper hereafter
denoted by
II) is, however,
to suggest
just
such
an alternative
interpretation.
In contrast to the usual interpretation,
this alternative
interpretation
permits
us to conceive
of each individual
system
as being
in a precisely
de-
6nable state, whose changes
with time are determined
by definite
laws, analogous
to (but not identical
with)
the classical equations
of motion. Quantum-mechanical
probabilities
are regarded
(like their
counterparts
in
classical
statistical
mechanics)
as
only
a practical
necessity
and not as a manifestation
of an inherent
lack of complete
determination
in the properties
of
matter
at the quantum
level. As long as the present
general form of Schroedinger's
equation
is retained,
the
physical results obtained with our suggested
alternative
interpretation
are precisely
the same as those obtained
with
the usual
interpretation.
Ke shall
see, however,
that
our alternative
interpretation
permits
modi6ca-
tions of the mathematical
formulation
which could not
even be described
in terms of the usual interpretation.
Moreover,
the modifications
can quite
easily be for-
mulated
in such a way that their eGects are insigni6cant
in the
atomic
domain,
where
the
present
quantum
theory is in such good agreement
with experiment,
but
of crucial importance
in the domain
of dimensions
of
the
order
of 10 " cm, where,
as we have
seen,
the
present
theory is totally inadequate. It is thus entirely
possible
that
some of the modifications
describable
in
terms
of our suggested
alternative
interpretation,
but
in a very crude sense. Thus, it is generally
expected that in con-
nection
with
phenomena
associated
with
this so-called
"funda-
mental
length, " a totally
new
theory
will probably
be needed.
It is hoped that this theory could not only deal precisely with such
processes as meson production
and scattering
of elementary
par-
ticles, but that it would
also systematically
predict
the masses,
charges, spins, etc., of the large number
of so-called "elementary"
particles
that have already
been found,
as well as those of new
particles
which might be found in the future,

not in terms of the usual interpretation,
may be needed
for a more
thorough
understanding
of phenomena
associated
with
very
small
distances.
We shall
not,
however,
actually
develop
such
modifications
in any
detail in tlMsc papers.
After this article was completed,
the author's
atten-
tion was called to similar
proposals
for an alternative
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory
made
by dc
Broglie' in 1926, but later given up by him partly
as
a result of certain criticisms made by Paulis and partly
because of additional
objections
raised by de Broglie7
himself. f As we shall show in Appendix B of Paper II,
however,
all of the objections of Re Broglie and Pauli
could have been met if only de Broglie had carried his
ideas to their logical conclusion. The essential
new step
in doing this is to apply our interpretation
in the theory
of the measurement
process
itself as well
as in the
description
of the observed system. Such a development
of the theory
of measurements
is given
in Paper II,'
where it mill be shown in detail that our interpretation
leads to precisely
the same results
for all experiments
as are
obtained
with
the
usual
interpretation.
The
foundation
for doing this is laid in Paper I, where
we
develop
the
basis
of our
interpretation,
contrast
it
with
the usual
interpretation,
and
apply it to a few
simple
examples,
in order to illustrate
the principles
involved.
2. THE USUAL PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
OF THE QUANTUM
THEORY
The usual
physical
interpretation
of the quantum
theory centers around
the uncertainty
principle.
Now,
the uncertainty
principle can be derived in tmo diferent
ways. First, we may start with the assumption
already
criticized
by Einstein,
namely,
that a mave function
that
determines
only
probabilities
of actual
experi-
mental results nevertheless
provides
the most complete
possible specification
of the so-called "quantum
state"
of an individual
system. With the aid of this assump-
tion and with the aid of the de Broglie relation, y=kk,
where
k is the wave
number
associated
with
a par-
tjcular
fourier
component
of the
wave
function,

Madelung
has also proposed
a similar
interpretation
of the quantum
theory, but like de Broglie he did
not carry this interpretation
to a logical conclusion. See E. Made-
lung, Z. f. Physik 40, 332 (1926), also G. Temple, Introduction
to
Quantum
Theory (London, 1931).

Lace J. von
Neumann,

(Verlag, Julius
Springer,
Berlin, 1932)j that quantum
theory cannot be understood
in terms of a statistical
distribution
of "hidden" causal parameters. %e shall show that his conclusions
do not apply to our interpretation,
because he implicitly
assumes
that
the hidden
parameters
must
be associated
only
with
the
observed system, whereas,
as will become evident in these papers,
our interpretation
requires that the hidden
parameters
shall also
be associated with the measuring
apparatus.
uncertainty
principle
is readily
deduced. '0 From this
derivation,
we are
led to interpret
the
uncertainty
principle
as an inherent
and irreducible
limitation
on
the precision
with
which it is correct for us even to
conceive of momentum
and position as simultaneously
defined quantities.
For if, as is done in the usual inter-
pretation
of the quantum
theory,
the wave intensity
is assumed
to determine
only the probability
of a given
position, and if the kth Fourier component
of the wave
function
is assumed
to determine
only the probability
of a corresponding
momentum,
y= Ak, then it becomes
a contradiction
in terms
to ask for a state in which
momentum
and position
are simultaneously
and pre-
cisely defined.
A
second
possible
dcl ivatlon
of
tlM
unccl tain ty
principle
is based
on a theoretical
analysis
of the
processes
with
the aid of which
physically
significant
quantities
such
as momentum
and
position
can be
measured.
In such an analysis,
one finds that because
the measuring
apparatus
interacts
with
the observed
system by means of indivisible
quanta, there will always
be an irreducible
disturbance
of some observed
prop-
erty of the system. If the precise
CGects of this dis-
turbance
could
be predicted
or controlled,
then
one
couM correct for these effects, and thus one couM still
in
principle
obtain
simultaneous
measurements
of
momentum
and position,
having
unlimited
precision.
But if one could do this, then the uncertainty
principle
would be violated. The uncertainty
principle
is, as we
have
seen,
however,
a necessary
consequence
of the
assumption
that the wave function
and its probability
interpretation
provide
the
most
complete
possible
specification
of the state of an individual
system. In
order to avoid the possibility
of a contradiction
with
this assumption, Bohr"'0" and others have suggested
an additional
assumption,
namely,
that the process of
transfer
of a single quantum
from observed
system to
measuring
apparatus
is inherently
unpredictable,
un-
controllable,
and
not
subject
to a detailed
rational
analysis or description.
With the aid of this assumption,
one can
show'0
that
the
same
uncertainty
principle
that is deduced
from the wave function
and its proba-
bility interpretation
is also obtained as an inherent
and
unavoidable
limitation
on the precision
of all possible
measurements.
Thus,
one is able to obtain
a set of
assumptions,
which
permit
a self-consistent
formula-
tion of the usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory.
The above point
of view
has been
given
its most
consistent
and systematic
expression
by Bohr,' ' " in
terms
of the "principle
of complementarity. " In for-
mulating
this
principle,
Bohr
suggests
that
at the
atomic level we must renounce
our hitherto
successful
practice
of conceiving
of an individual
system
as a
unified
and. precisely
dehnable
whole,
all of whose as-
pects are, in a manner
of speaking,
simultaneously
and

bridge University
Press, London, 1934}.

unambiguously
accessible to our conceptual
gaze. Such
a system
of concepts
which
is sometimes
called a
"model, " need not be restricted
to pictures,
but may
also include,
for example,
mathematical
concepts,
as
long as these
are supposed
to be in a precise
(i.e.,
one-to-one)
correspondence
with
the objects that are
being
described.
The
principle
of
complementarity
requires
us, however,
to renounce
even mathematica, l
models. Thus, in Bohr's point of view, the wave func-
tion is in no sense a conceptual
model of an individual
system,
since it is not in a precise
(one-to-one)
corre-
spondence
with the behavior
of this system,
but only
in a statistical
correspondence.
In place of a precisely dered conceptual
model, the
prinriple
of complementarity
states
that
we are re-
stricted
to complementarity
pairs
of inherently
im-
prerisely
defined
concepts,
such
as position
and
mo-
mentum,
pa,rticle and wave, etc. The maximum
degree
of precision
of definition
of either
member
of such a
pair
is reriprocally
related
to that
of the
opposite
member.
This need for an inherent
lack of complete
precision
can be understood
in two ways. First, it can
be. regarded
as a consequence
of the fact that the ex-
perimental
apparatus
needed
for a precise
measure-
ment of one member
of a complementary
pair of vari-
ables must always be such as to preclude
the possibility
of a simultaneous
and precise measurement
of the other
member.
Secondly,
the assumption
that an individual
system is completely
specified by the wave function and
its probability
interpretation
implies
a corresponding
unavoidable
lack of precision
in the very
conceptual
structure,
with
the
a,id of which
we can think
about
and describe the behavior
of the system.
It is only at the classical level that we can correctly
neglect the inherent
lack of precision
in all of our con-
ceptual models; for here, the incomplete
determination
of physical
properties
implied by the uncertainty
prin-
ciple produces
effects that are too small to be of prac-
tical
significance.
Our
ability
to
describe
classical
systems
in terms of precisely
definable
models is, how-
ever, an integral part of the usual interpretation
of the
theory.
For without
such
models,
we would
have
no
way to describe,
or even to think
of, the result
of an
observation,
which
is of course always
6nally
carried
out at a classical level of accuracy. If the relationships
of a given
set of classically
describa, ble phenomena
depend
signihcantly
on the
essentially
quantum-me-
chanical
properties
of matter,
however,
then the prin-
ciple of complementarity
states that no single model is
possible
which
could
provide
a precise
and
rational
analysis
of the connections
between
these phenomena.
In such a case, we are not supposed,
for example,
to
attempt
to describe
in detail
how future
phenomena
arise out of past phenomena.
Instead, we shouM simply
accept without
further
analysis
the fact that
future
phenomena
do in fact somehow
manage to be produced,
in a way that is, however,
necessarily
beyond the possi-
bility
of a detailed
description.
The
only
aim
of a
mathematical
theory
is then to predict
the statistical
relations,
if any, connecting
these phenomena.
3. CRITICISM OF THE USUAL INTERPRETATION
OF
THE QUANTUM
THEORY
The usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory can
be criticized on many grounds. ' In this paper, however,
we shall stress only the fact that it requires
us to give
up the possibility
of even
conceiving
precisely
what
might
determine
the behavior
of an individual
system
at the
quantum
level,
without
providing
adequate
proof that such a renunciation
is necessary.
The usual
interpretation
is admittedly
consistent;
but the mere
demonstration
of such consistency
does not exclude the
possibility
of other equally
consistent
interpretations,
which would involve additional
elements
or parameters
permitting
a detailed causal and continuous
description
of all processes,
and
not requiring
us to forego
the
possibility
of conceiving
the quantum
level in precise
terms. From the point of view of the usual interpreta-
tion, these additional
elements
or parameters
could be
called "hidden" variables.
As a matter
of fact, when-
ever
we have
previously
had
recourse
to statistical
theories,
we have
always
ultimately
found
that
the
laws governing
the individual
members
of a statistical
ensemble
could
be expressed
in terms
of just
such
hidden
variables.
For example,
from the point of view
of macroscopic
physics,
the coordinates
and momenta
of individual
atoms
are hidden
variables,
which
in a
large
scale system
manifest
themselves
only
as sta-
tistical averages.
Perhaps
then, our present
quantum-
mechanical
averages
are similarly
a manifestation
of
hidden
variables,
which
have not, however,
yet been
detected directly.
Now it may be asked
why
these
hidden
variables
should
have so long remained
undetected.
To answer
this question, it is helpful to consider as an analogy the
early forms of the atomic theory, in which the existence
of atoms
was postulated
in order to explain
certain
large-scale
effects, such as the laws of chemical
com-
bination,
the gas laws, etc. On the other hand,
these
same effects could also be described
directly
in terms
of existing
macrophysical
concepts
(such as pressure,
volume,
temperature,
mass, etc.); and a correct de-
scription in these terms did not require any reference to
atoms. Ultimately,
however,
effects were found
which
contradicted
the predictions
obtained
by extrapolating
certain purely
macrophysical
theories to the domain
of
the very
small,
and
which
could be understood
cor-
rectly in terms of the assumption
that matter
is com-
posed of atoms. Similarly,
we suggest that if there are
hidden
variables
underlying
the
present
quantum
theory, it is quite likely that in the atomic domain, they
will lead to effects that can also be described adequately
in the terms of the usual quantum-mechanical
concepts;
while in a domain assoriated
with much smaller dimen-
sions, such as the level associated with the "fundamental
length" of the order of 10 "cm, the hidden
variables

VARIABLES.

may lead to completely
new sects not consistent
with
the extrapolation
of the present
quantum
theory
down
to this level.
If, as is certainly
entirely possible, these hidden vari-
ables are actually
needed
for a correct description
at
small distances,
we could easily be kept on the wrong
track for a long time by restricting
ourselves
to the
usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
which ex-
cludes such hidden
variables
as a matter
of principle.
It is therefore
very important
for us to investigate
our
reasons
for supposing
that
the
usual
physical
inter-
pretation
is likely to be the correct one. To this end, we
shall
begin by repeating
the two mutually
consistent
assumptions
on which the usual interpretation
is based
(see Sec. 2):
(1) The
wave
function
with
its probability
inter-
pretation
determines
the most complete
possible speci-
fication of the state of an individual
system.
(2) The process of transfer of a single quantum
from
observed
system to measuring
apparatus
is inherently
unpredictable,
uncontrollable,
and unanalyzable.
Let us now inquire into the question of whether
there
are any experiments
that could conceivably
provide
a
test for these assumptions.
It is often stated
in con-
nection
with
this problem
that
the mathematical
ap-
paratus
of the
quantum
theory
and
its physical
in-
terpretation
form
a consistent
whole
and
that
this
combined
system
of
mathematical
apparatus
and
physical
interpretation
is tested
adequately
by
the
extremely
wide range of experiments
that are in agree-
ment
with predictions
obtained
by using
this system.
If assumptions
(1) and
(2) implied
a unique
mathe-
matical
formulation,
then such a conclusion
would
be
valid, because
experimental
predictions
could then be
found
which,
if contradicted,
would
clearly
indicate
that these assumptions
were wrong. Although
assump-
tions (1) and
(2) do limit
the possible
forms
of the
mathematical
theory,
they
do not limit
these
forms
suKciently
to make possible a unique set of predictions
that
could
in principle
permit
such
an experimental
test. Thus,
one can contemplate
practically
arbitrary
changes
in the
Hamiltonian
operator,
including,
for
example,
the postulation
of an unlimited
range of new
kinds of meson fields each having
almost any conceiv-
able rest mass,
charge,
. spin,
magnetic
moment,
etc.
And if such postulates
should
prove to be inadequate,
it is conceivable
that we may have to introduce
non-
local operators,
nonlinear
fields, S-matrices,
etc. This
means that when the theory is found to be inadequate
(as now happens,
for example, at distances of the order
of 10 "cm), it is always
possible, and, in fact, usually
quite natural,
to assume
that the theory
can be made
to agree
with
experiment
by some
as yet
unknown
change
in
the
mathematical
formulation
alone,
not
requiring
any fundamental
changes
in the physical
in-
terpretation.
This means that as long as we accept the
usual
physical
interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
we cannot
be led by any
conceivable
experiment
to
4. NEW PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
OF
SCHROEDINGER'S
EQUATION
We shall
now give a general
description
of our sug-
gested
physical
interpretation
of the present
mathe-
matical
formulation
of the quantum
theory. We shall
carry
out a more
detailed
description
in subsequent
sections of this paper.
We begin
with
the one-particle
Schroedinger
equa-
tion, and shall later generalize
to an arbitrary
number
of particles. This wave equation
is
i7iBQ/Bt =—(t'i'/2m) VQ+ V(x)P.
Now P is a complex function,
which can be expressed as
P=E e p(ixS/5),
where R and S are real. We readily verify that the equa-
tions for E. and S are
BR
fRV'S+2VR VS],
Bt
2m
(VS)'+V(x)—
2m R
h2 V2R-
2m
give up this interpretation,
even if it should happen to
be wrong. The usual
physical
interpretation
therefore
presents
us with a considerable
danger
of falling
into
a trap,
consisting
of a self-closing
chain
of circular
hypotheses,
which are in principle
unverifiable
if true.
The only way of avoiding
the possibility
of such a trap
is to study
the consequences
of postulates
that
con-
tradict
assumptions
(1) and (2) at the outset.
Thus,
we could, for example,
postulate
that the precise out-
come
of each
individual
measurement
process
is in
principle
determined
by
some at present
"hidden"
elements
or variables;
and
we could then
try to find
experiments
that depended
in a unique and reproducible
way on the assumed
state of these hidden
elements
or
variables.
If such predictions
are verified,
we should
then
obtain
experimental
evidence
favoring
the
hy-
pothesis
that
hidden
variables
exist. If they
are not
verified,
however, 'the
correctness
of the
usual
in-
terpretation
of the quantum
theory
is not necessarily
proved,
since it may be necessary
instead
to alter the
specific character
of the theory
that
is supposed
to
describe the behavior
of the assumed
hidden
variables.
We conclude
then that a choice of the present
in-
terpretation
of the
quantum
theory
involves
a real
physical limitation
on the kinds of theories that we wish
to take into consideration.
From the arguments
given
here, however,
it would
seem that there are no secure
experimental
or theoretical
grounds
on which
we can
base
such a choice because
this
choice follows
from
hypotheses
that cannot conceivably
be subjected to an
experimental
test
and
because
we
now
have
an
al-
ternative
interpretation.

It is convenient

Now, in the classical limit
(t~—
'&0) the above equations
are subject to a very simple
interpretation.
The func-
tion S(x) is a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation.
If we consider an ensemble
of particle trajectories which
are solutions
of the equations
of motion,
then it is a
well-known
theorem
of mechanics
that if all of these
trajectories are normal to any given surface of constant
S, then they are normal
to all surfaces
of constant S,
and VS(x)/m will be equal to the velocity vector, v(x),
for any particle
passing
the point x. Equation
(5) can
therefore be re-expressed
as
M'/Bt+V
(Pv) =0.
(7)
This equation
indicates that it is consistent to regard
P(x) as the probability
density
for particles
in our
ensemble.
For in that case, we can regard Pv as the
mean current
of particles
in this ensemble,
and Eq. (7)
then simply
expresses
the conservation
of probability.
I.et us now see to what extent this interpretation
can
be given a meaning
even when kAO. To do this, let us
assume
that each particle
is acted on, not only by a
"classical" potential,
V(x) but
also by a "quantum-
mechanical"
potential,
—O' V'P
1 (VP)'
—O' V'R
U(x) =

Then Eq. (6) can still be regarded
as the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation
for our ensemble
of particles,
VS(x)/m
can still be regarded
as the particle velocity, and Eq. (5)
can
still
be regarded
as describing
conservation
of
probability
in our ensemble.
Thus, it would
seem that
we have here the nucleus
of an alternative
interpreta-
tion for Schroedinger's
equation.
The first step in developing
this interpretation
in a
more explicit way is to associate with each electron a
particle
having
precisely
definable
and
continuously
varying
values
of position
and momentum.
The solu-
tion
of the
modified
Hamilton-Jacobi
equation
(4)
defines
an
ensemble
of possible
trajectories
for this
particle,
which
can be obtained
from
the Hamilton-
Jacobi
function,
S(x), by
integrating
the
velocity,
v(x) = VS(x)/m. The equation
for S implies,
however,
that
the particles
moves
under
the action
of a force
which
is not entirely
derivable
from the classical po-
tential, V(x), but which also obtains a contribution
from
the "quantum-mechanical"
potential,
U(x) = (—h'/2m)
XV2R/R. The function,
R(x), is not completely
arbi-
trary, but is partially
determined
in terms of S(x) by
the differential
Eq. (3). Thus R and S can be said to
codetermine
each other. The most convenient
way of
obtaining R and S is, in fact, usually
to solve Eq. (1)
for the Schroedinger
wave function, P, and then to use
the relations,
f= U+iW=RI cos(S/ti)+i sin(S/8)],
R'= U'+ V'
S=k tan '(W/U).
Since the force on a particle
now depends
on a func-
tion of the absolute
value, R(x), of the wave function,
P(x), evaluated
at the actual
location
of the particle,
we have electively
been led to regard
the wave func-
tion of an individual
electron as a mathematical
repre-
sentation
of an objectively
real field. This field exerts
a force on the particle
in a way that is analogous
to,
but not identical
with,
the way
in which
an electro-
magnetic
field exerts a force on a charge, and a meson
field exerts a force on a nucleon.
In the last analysis,
there is, of course, no reason why a particle should not
be acted on by a f-field, as well as by an electromagnetic
field, a gravitational
field, a set of meson
fields,
and
perhaps
by still other
fields that
have
not yet been
discovered.
The analogy
with
the electromagnetic
(and other)
field goes quite
far. For just as the electromagnetic
field
obeys
Maxwell's
equations,
the
f-field
obeys
Schroedinger's
equation.
In both
cases, a complete
specification
of the fields at a given instant
over every
point
in space determines
the values
of the fields for
all times. In both cases, once we know the field func-
tions,
we can calculate
force on a particle,
so that,
if we also know the initial position
and momentum
of
the particle,
we can calculate its entire trajectory.
In this connection, it is worth while to recall that the
use of the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation
in solving for the
motion
of a particle
is only a matter
of convenience
and that, in principle,
we can always
solve directly by
using Newton's
laws of motion and the correct boundary
conditions.
The equation
of motion of a particle acted
on by the classical potential,
V(x), and the "quantum-
mechanical"
potential, Eq. (8), is
md'x/dt'= —V I V(x)—(5'/2m) V'R/R I .
(Sa)
It is in connection
with
the
boundary
conditions
appearing
in the equations
of motion that we find the
only
fundamental
difference
between
the f-field
and
other
fields, such as the electromagnetic
Geld. For in
order to obtain results that are equivalent
to those of
the usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
we are
required
to restrict
the value
of the
initial
particle
momentum
to y= VS(x). From
the
application
of
Hamilton-Jacobi
theory to Eq. (6), it follows that this
restriction
is consistent,
in the sense that
if it holds
initially,
it will hold for all time. Our suggested
new
interpretation
of the quantum
theory implies, however,
that
this restriction
is not inherent
in the conceptual
structure.
We shall see in Sec. 9, for example, that it is

OF ''HIDDEN''
VARIABI ES. I
quite
consistent
in our interpretation
to contemplate
modihcations
in the theory,
which permit
an arbitrary
relation between
y and V'S(x). The law of force on, the
particle can, however,
be so chosen that in the atomic
domain,
p turns out to be very nearly equal to VS(x)/m,
while in processes involving
very small distances,
these
two quantities
may be very diGerent. In this way, we
can improve
the analogy
between
the f-Geld and the
electromagnetic
field
(as
well
as between
quantum
mechanics
and classical mechanics).
Another
important
difference
between
the
P-Geld
and the electromagnetic
held is that, whereas
Schroed-
inger's
equation
is homogeneous
in P, Maxwell's
equa-
tions are inhomogeneous
in the electric and magnetic
6elds. Since inhomogeneities
are needed to give rise to
radiation,
this means
that, our present
equations
imp1y
that the f-Geld is not radiated
or absorbed,
but simply
changes its form while its integrated
intensity
remains
constRnt.
This rcstllctlon
to R holTlogcncous
cquRtlon
is, however,
like the restriction to a homogeneous
equa-
tion is, however,
like the restriction
to y=&S(x), not
inherent
ln thc conccptuRl
stI'uctuI'c
of our ncw
in-
terpretation.
Thus, in Sec. 9, we shall
show that one
can consistently
postulate
inhomogeneities
in the equa-
tion governing
P, which produce important
effects only
at very
small
distances,
and
negligible
effects in the
atomic
domain.
If such
inhomogeneities
are actually
pl'cscIlt, then tllc 'lp-Geld will bc sub]cct 'to bciIlg cIIlit ted
and absorbed,
but only in connection
with
px'ocesses
associated
with very small distances.
Once the P-field
has been emitted, however, it will in all atomic processes
simply
obey Schroedinger's
equation
as a very
good
approximation.
Nevertheless,
at very
small
distances,
the value of the f-Geld would, as in the case of the elec-
tromagnetic
Geld, depend to some extent on the actual
location of the particle.
Let us now consider
the meaning
of the assumption
of a statistical
ensemble
of particles
with a probability
density
equal to E(x)=R'(x) =
~ p(x) ~'. From Eq. (5),
it follows that this assumption
is consistent,
provided
that P satisfies Schroedinger's
equation,
and v = V'S(x)/
m. This probability
density
is numerically
equal to the
probability
density
of particles
obtained
in the usual
interpretation.
In the
usual
interpretation,
however,
the need for a probability
description
is regarded
as
inherent
in the very structure
of matter
(see Sec. 2),
whereas
in our interpretation,
it arises,
a,s we shall sec
in Paper II, because
from
one measurement
to the
next, we cannot in practice predict or control the pre-
cise location of a particle, as a result of corresponding
unpredictable
and
uncontrollable
disturbances
intro-
duced by the measuring
apparatus.
Thus,
ln oUl
1Q-
terpretation,
the use of a statistical
ensemble
is (as in
the case of classical statistical
mechanics)
only a prac-
tical
necessity,
and
not a reAection
of an
inherent
imitation
on the precision
with which it is correct for
us to conceive of the variables
defining
the state of the
system. Moreover, it is clear that if in connection
with
very small distances
we are ultimately
required to give
up the
special
assumptions
that f satisGes
Schroed-
inger's
equation
and that v= VS(x)/III, then
~it ~' will
cea,se to satisfy a conservation
equation
and will there-
fore also cease to be able to represent
the probability
density of particles. Nevertheless,
there wouM still be a
true probability
density of particles which is conserved.
Thus, it would become possible in principle
to And ex-
periments
in which
~f~' could be distinguished
from
the probability
density,
and therefore to prove that the
usual
interpretation,
which
gives
~p~s only a proba-
bility
interpretation
must
be inadequate.
Moreover,
we shall
see in Paper II that
with
the aid of such
modidcations
in
the
theory,
we
couM
in
principle
measure
the particle positions
Rnd momenta
precisely,
Rnd thus vlolRtc thc unccI'tMnty
pI'lnclplc.
As long Rs
we restrict
ourselves
to conditions
in which
Schroed-
lilgcr s cquatloI1 is satlsflcd,
alld Ill wlllcll v= VS(x)/tÃ
however,
the
uncertainty
principle
will
remain
an
CAective practical
limitation
on the possible
precision
of measurements.
This
means
that
at present,
the
particle positions
and momenta
should
be regarded
as
"hidden" variables,
since as wc shall sec in Paper II,
we are not now able to obtain experiments
that localize
them to a region smaller than that in which the intensity
of the f-Geld is appreciable.
Thus, we cannot yet find
clear-cut
experimental
proof that
the
assumption
of
these
variables
is necessary,
although
it is entirely
posslblc
that
ln thc domalQ
of very
small
dlstaQccs
new modi6cations
in the theory may have to be intro-
duced, which would permit a proof of the existence of
the
definite
particle
position
and
momentum
to be
obtained.
We conclude that our suggested
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory
provides
a much
broader
conceptual
framework
than that provided
by the usual interpreta-
tion, for all of the results of the usual interpretation
are
obtained from our interpretation
if we make the follow-
ing
three
special
assumptions
which
are
mutually
consistent:
(1) That the P-6eld satis6es Schroedinger's
equation.
(2) That the particle momentum
is restricted
to y= V'S(x).
(3) That ere do not predict or control the precise location of the
particle, but have, in practice, a statistical
ensemble
with proba-
bility
density P(x)=
rP(x) )'. The nse of statistics
is, however,
not inherent
in the conceptual
structure,
but
merely
a conse-
quence
of our ignorance
of the precise initial
conditions
of the
particle.
As we shall see in Sec. 9, it is entirely
possible that a
better theory of phenomena
involving
distances
of the
order of 10 "cm or less would require us to go beyond
the limitations
of these special assumptions.
Our prin-
cipal purpose
in this paper (and in Paper II) is to show,
however,
that if one makes these special assumptions,
our interpretation
leads in all possible
experiments
to
the same predictions
as are obtained
from the usual
1QtcrPI'ctRtloQ.
It is now easy to understand
why the adoption of the

DAVID
BOHM
usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory would tend
to lead us away
from the direction
of our suggested
alternative
interpretation.
For in a theory
involving
hidden
variables,
one would
normally
expect that the
bchavlor
of aQ lndlvldual
systcn1
should
not dcpcQd
on the statistical
ensemble
of which
it is a member,
because this ensemble
refers to a series of similar but
disconnected
experiments
carried out under
equivalent
initial
conditions.
In our interpretation,
however,
the
"quantum-mechanical"
potential,
U(x), acting
on an
individual
particle
depends
on a wave intensity,
P(x),
that is also numerically
equal to a probability
density
in our ensemble.
In the terminology
of the usual
in-
terpretation
of the
quantum
theory,
in
which
one
tacitly
assumes
that
the wave function
has only
one
interpretation;
namely,
in terms of a probability,
our
suggested
ncw lntcrprctatloQ
would look like a mysteri-
ous
dependence
of the
individual
on the
statistical
ensemble of which it is a member. In our interpretation,
such a dependence
is perfectly
rational,
because
the
wave function
can consistently
be interpreted
both as
a force and as a probability
density. "
It is instructive
to carry
our analogy
between
the
Schroedinger
field and other kinds of fields a bit further.
To do this,
we can derive
the wave Eqs. (5) and (6)
from a Hamiltonian
functional.
Ke begin
by writing
down
the expression
for the mean
energy
as it is ex-
pressed in the usual quantum
theory:
The mean particle
energy
is found by averaging
E(x)
with the weighting
function, P(x). We obtain
{@ensemble= Jt P(X)E(X)dX

These
are,
however,
the

Eqs. (5) and (6).
Kc can now
show
that
the mean
particle
energy
averaged
over our ensemble
is equal to the usual quan-
tum mechanical
mean value of the Hamiltonian,
H. To
do this, we note that according to Eqs. (3) and (6), the

We shall now reinterpret
P(x) as a Geld coordinate,

assume
that S(x) is the momentum,
canonically
conjugate
to
P(x). That such an assumption
is appropriate
can be
verified by finding the Hamiltonian
equations
of motion
for P(x}and S(x},under the assumption
that the Hamil-

The questions
of why an arbitrary

tends to
decay into an ensemble
with a probability
density
equal to P*P
will be discussed
in Paper II, Sec. 7.
S. THE STATIONARY
STATE
YVe shall
now
show how the problem
of stationary
states
is to be treated
in our interpretation
of the
quantum
theory.
The following
seem to be reasonable
requirements
in
our interpretation
for a stationary
state:
(1) The particle
energy
should
be a constant
of the
motion,
(2) The
quantum-mechanical
potential
should
be
independent
of time.
(3) The probability
density
in
our
statistical
en-
semble should be independent
of time.
It is easily verified
that
these requirements
can be
satisfied with the assumption
that
P(x, t)=Pp(x) exp(—sEt/is)
=Re(x)expt i(4 (x)—Er)/hg.
(12)
From the above, we obtain S=C (x)—Et. According
to
the generalized
Hamilton-Jacobi
Eq. (4), the particle
energy is given by
BS/83= —E.
Thus, we verify that the particle
energy
is a constant
of the motion. Moreover,
since P=R'= ~P~', it follows
that P (and R) are independent
of time. This means
that both the probability
density
in our ensemble
and
the
quantum-mechanical
potential
are
also
time
independent.

QUANTUM
THEORY
IN
TERMS
OF ''HI D DEN''
VAR lABLES.
I
The reader
will readily
verify that no other form of
solution of Schroedinger's
equation
will satisfy all three
of our criteria for a stationary
state.
Since P is now
being
regarded
as a mathematical
representation
of an
objectively
real
force
field,
it
follows
that
(like the electromagnetic
field) it should
be everywhere
6nite,
continuous,
and
single
valued.
These requirements
will guarantee
in all cases that occur
in practice that the allowed
values
of the energy
in a
stationary
state, and the corresponding
eigenfunctions
are the same as are obtained
from the usual interpreta-
tion of the theory.
In order to show
in more detail
what
a stationary
state means in our interpretation,
we shall now consider
three examples
of stationary
states.
Case 1:"s"State
The first case that we shall consider
is an "s" state.
In an "s"state, the wave function
is
f=f(r)exp[i(n —Et)/It],
(13)
where
0. is an arbitrary
constant
and r is the radius
taken from the center of the atom. We conclude
that
the Hamilton-Jacobi
function
is
S=n—8].
The particle velocity is
v= VS=0.
The particle is therefore
simply standing
still, wherever
it may happen
to be. How can it do this? The absence
of motion is possible because the applied force, —V'V(x),
is balanced
by the "quantum-mechanical"
force, (ft'/
2m)V(PR/R),
produced
by
the
Schroedinger
f-field
acting
on its own particle.
There
is, however,
a sta-
tistical
ensemble
of possible
positions
of the particle,
with a probability
density, P(x)= (f(r))'.
Case 2: State with Nonzero
Angular
Momentum
In a typical
state of nonzero
angular
momentum,
we have
1t =f„'(r)Pi (cos8)exp[i(P —Et+Am&)/kj,
(14)
where
8 and
it are the colatitude
and azimuthal
polar
angles,
respectively,
Pp
is the
associated
Legendre
polynomial,
and P is a constant.
The Hamilton-Jacobi
function
is S=P
Zt+hnnf&
From—this resul. t it follows
that
the s component
of the
angular
momentum
is
equal to km. To prove this, we write
I.,=xP„ yp. =xBS/By —yBS/Bx=BS/B—y=hm (15).
Thus,
we obtain
a statistical
ensemble
of trajectories
which can have diferent
forms, but all have the same
"quantized"
value of the s component
of the angular
momentum.
Case 3:A Scattering Problem
Let us now consider a scattering
problem.
Because
it is comparatively
easy to analyze,
we shall discuss a
hypothetical
experiment,
in which
an electron
is in-
cident in the s direction
with an initial momentum,
Po,
on a system consisting
of two slits."After the electron
passes through
the slit system, its position
is measured
and recorded, for example,
on a photographic
plate.
Now,
in the
usual
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory,
the electron
is described
by a wave function.
The incident part of the wave function
is fo
exp(iPos/
fi); but when the wave passes through
the slit sy'stem,
it is modified
by interference
and
diffraction
effects,
so that it will develop a characteristic
intensity
pattern
by the time it reaches
the position
measuring
instru-
ment. The probability
that the electron will be detected
between
x and x+dx is
~ lt (x) ~'dx. If the experiment
is
repeated
many
times
under
equivalent
initial
condi-
tions, one eventually
obtains
a pattern
of hits on the
photographic
plate
that
is very
reminiscent
of the
interference
patterns
of optics.
In the usual
interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
the origin of this interference
pattern
is very dif6cult
to understand.
For there may be certain points
where
the wave function
is zero when both slits are open, but
not
zero
when
only
one slit
is open.
How
can the
opening of a second slit prevent the electron from reach-
ing certain
points that it could reach if this slit were
closed? If the electron acted completely
like a classical
particle, this phenomenon
could not be explained at all.
Clearly,
then
the wave
aspects
of the electron
must
have something
to do with the production
of the inter-
ference pattern.
Yet, the electron
cannot be identical
with
its associated
wave,
because
the latter
spreads
out over a wide region.
On the other hand,
when
the
electron's
position
is measured,
it always
appears
at
the detector as if it were a localized particle.
The usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory not
only
makes
no attempt
to provide
a single
precisely
defined
conceptual
model
for the production
of the
phenomena
described
above,
but it asserts
that
no
such
model
is even
conceivable.
Instead
of a single
precisely
defined
conceptual
model,
it provides,
as
pointed
out in Sec. 2, a pair of complementary
models,
vis. , particle
and
wave,
each of which
can be made
more precise
only
under
conditions
which
necessitate
a reciprocal
decrease
in the degree of precision
of the
other. Thus,
while
the electron
goes through
the slit
system, its position is said to be inherently
ambiguous,
so that if we wish to obtain an interference
pattern,
it
is meaningless
to ask through
which
slit an individual
electron
actually
passed.
Within
the domain
of space
within
which the position of the electron has no mean-
ing we can use the wave model
and thus describe the
subsequent
production
of interference.
If, however,
we
"This experiment
is discussed
in some detail

DAVrD
BOH M
tried to define the position
of the electron as it passed
the slit system more accurately by means of a measure-
ment, the resulting
disturbance
of its motion produced
by the measuring
apparatus
would
destroy
the inter-
ference pattern.
Thus, conditions
would
be created
in
which
the particle
model
becomes
more precisely
de-
fined at the expense of a corresponding
decrease in the
degree of definition
of the wave model. When the posi-
tion of the electron
is measured
at the photographic
plate, a similar sharpening
of the degree of definition
of
the particle
model occurs at the expense of that of the
wave model.
In our interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
this
experiment
is described
causally
and
continuously
in
terms of a single precisely
definable
conceptual
model.
As we have already
shown,
we must use the same wave
function
as is used
in the
usual
interpretation;
but
instead
we regard it as a mathematical
representation
of an objectively
real Geld that determines
part of the
force acting on the particle. The initial
momentum
of
the particle
is obtained
from the incident
wave func-
tion, exp(epos/k),
as p=8s/Os= po We .do not in prac-
tice, however,
control
the initial
location
of the par-
ticle, so that although
it goes through
a definite
slit,
we cannot predict
which
slit this will be. The particle
is at all times acted on by the "quantum-mechanical"
potential,
U=(—A'/2m)PR/R.
While
the particle
is
incid. ent, this potential
vanishes
because R is then
a
constant;
but after it passes
through
the slit system,
the
particle
encounters
a
quantum-mechanical
po-
tential
that changes
rapidly
with position. The subse-
quent
motion
of the particle
may
therefore
become
quite
complicated.
Nevertheless,
the probability
that
a particle shall enter a given region, dx, is as in the usual
mterpretation,
equal to
~ P(x)
~ 'dx. We therefore deduce
that
the particle
can never
reach a point
where
the
wave function
vanishes.
The reason is that the "quan-
tum-mechanical"
poteQtial,
U, becomes
iQGQlte
wlien
R becomes zero. If the approach
to infinity
happens
to
be through
positive
values
of U, there
will be an in-
finite force repelling
the particle away from the origin.
If the approach
is through
negative
values
of U, the
particle
will go through
this point with infinite
speed,
and thus spend no time there. In either case, we obtain
a simple
and precisely
definable
conceptual
model
ex-
plaining
why
particles
can never be found at points
where the wave function vanishes.
If one of the slits is closed, the "quantum-mechanical"
potential
is correspondingly
altered, because the P-Geld
is changed,
and the particle may then be able to reach
certain points which it was unable to reach when both
slits were open. The slit is therefore
able to a6ect the
motion
of the
particle
only
indirectly,
through
its
effect on the Schroedinger
P-Geld. Moreover, as we shall
see in Paper II, if the position
of the electron is meas-
ured
while it is passing
through
the slit system,
the
measuring
apparatus
will, as in the usual interpretation,
create
a disturbance
that
destroys
the
interference
pattern.
In our interpretation,
however,
the necessity
for this destruction
is not inherent
in the conceptual
structure;
and as we shall see, the destruction
of the
interference
pattern
could in principle
be avoided
by
means
of other
ways
of making
measurements,
ways
which are conceivable but not now actually
possible.

The above
equations
are simply
a six-dimensional
generalization
of the similar
three-dimensional
Eqs. (5)
and (6) associated
with the one-body
problem.
In the
two-body
problem,
the system
is described
therefore
by a six-dimensional
Schroedinger
wave and by a six-
dimensional
trajectory,
specifying
the actual
location
of each of the two particles. The velocity
of this tra-
jectory
has
components,
V'iS/nz
and
V'g/m,
respec-
tively, in each of the three-dimensional
surfaces associ-
ated with a given particle. P(xi, x2) then has a dual
interpretation.
First, it defines a "quantum-mechanical"
potential,
acting on each particle
V(xi, x2) = —(jr'/2mR) [V'i2R+ V'22R].
This potential
introduces
an additional
effective inter-
action between particles over and above that due to the
classically inferrable potential
V(x). Secondly, the func-
tion
P(xi, x2)
can
consistently
be
regarded
as the
probability
density
of representative
points (xi, x&) in
our six-dimensional
ensemble.
The extension
to an arbitrary
number
of particles
is straightforward,
and we shaH quote only the results
here.
We introduce
the
wave
function,
Q=R(x„x2,

deGne
a 3n-dimen-
sional trajectory,
where e is the number
of particles,
which
describes
the behavior

system. The velocity

We shall now extend our interpretation
of the quan-
tum theory to the problem
of many bodies. Vfe begin
with the Schroedinger
equation
for two particles. (For
simplicity,
we assume
that
they
have
equal
masses,
but the extension of our treatment
to arbitrary
masses
will be obvious. )

We see here that the "effective potential, " U(x~, x2,

to that pro-
duced by a "many-body"
force, since the force betvreen
any
tvro
particles
may
depend
significantly
on the
location of every other particle
in the system.
An ex-
ample of the effects of such a force is given by the ex-
clusion
principle.
Thus,
if the wave
function
is anti-
symmetric,
we deduce that the "quantum-mechanical"
forces vrill be such as to prevent
two particles from ever
reaching
the same point in space, for in this case, vre
must have I'=0.
/. TRANSITIONS
BETWEEN STATIONARY STATES-
THE FRANCE-HERTZ
EXPERIMENT
Our interpretation
of the quantum
theory
describes
all processes
as basically
causal and continuous.
How
then can it lead to a correct description
of processes
such as the Franck-Hertz
experiment,
the photoelectric
effect, and
the
Compton
effect,
which
seem
to call
most strikingly
for an interpretation
in terms
of dis-
continuous
and
incompletely
determined
transfers
of
energy and momentums
In this section, we shall ansvrer
this question
by applying
our suggested
interpretation
of the quantum
theory
in the analysis
of the Franck-
Hertz
experiment.
Here,
we
shall
see that
the
ap-
parently
discontinuous
nature of the process of transfer
of energy from the bombarding
particle to the atomic
electron is brought about by the "quantum-mechanica1"
potential,
U= (—h'/2m)P'E/R,
which
does not neces-
sarily become small when
the wave intensity
becomes
small. Thus,
even if the force of interaction
between
two particles
is very weak, so that a correspondingly
small disturbance
of the Schroedinger
wave function
is
produced
by the interaction
of these
particles,
this
disturbance
is capable
of bringing
about
very
large
transfers
of energy
and momentum
between
the par-
ticles in a very short time. This means that if we view
only the end results,
this process presents
the aspect
of being
discontinuous.
Moveover,
vre shall
see that
the precise value of the energy
transfer
is in principle
determined
by the initial position of each particle and
by the initial form of the wave function. Since we cannot
in practice predict
or control
the initial particle
posi-
tions
with
complete
precision,
vre are also unable
to
predict or control the final outcome of such an experi-
ment, and can, in practice, predict only the probability
of a given outcome. Because the probability
that the
particles
will enter a region with coordinates,
xI, x2, is
proportional
to E'(x~, x2), we conclude
that although
a Schroedinger
wave of lovr intensity
can bring about
large transfers
of energy,
such a process is (as in the
usual interpretation)
highly
improbable.
In Appendix
A of Paper II, we shall see that similar
possibilities
arise in connection
with the interaction
of
the electromagnetic
fmld vrith charged matter,
so that
electromagnetic
vraves can very rapidly
transfer a full
quantum
of energy
(and momentum)
to an electron,
even after they have spread
out and fallen to a very
low intensity.
In this way, we shall explain the photo-
electric eGect and the Compton
eGect. Thus„we ale
able in our interpretation
to understand
by means of a
causal
and continuous
model just those properties
of
matter
and light vrhich
seem most convincingly
to re-
quire the assumption
of discontinuity
and incomplete
determinism.
Before we discuss the process of interaction
between
tvro particles,
vre shall 6nd it convenient
to analyze the
problem
of an isolated,
single particle that happens
to
be in a nonstationary
state. Because the 6eld function
P is a solution of Schroedinger
s equation,
we can line-
arly suppose stationary-state
solutions
of this equation
and in this way obtain new solutions. As an illustration,
let us consider a superposition
of two solutions
P- Cygne(x) exp(—iEit/5)+ C2$2(x)exp( —iE2i/k),
where Cq, C~, g&, and f2 are real. Thus we write fq=E&,
1/2=22, and
P=expL —i(E&+E2)t/2h]IC&R& expt
i(E)—E2)t/—2k]
+C2E2 exp/i(Eg —E2)t/2k] I.
Writing P=E exp(i5/h),
we obtain
E2—C12+12(x)+C22+22(x)
+2CgCpEg(x)Eg(x)cosL(Eg —E2)t/2A],
(19)
S+(Eg—E2)t/2
C2E,(x)—Cog(x)
(Eg—E2)t
tan
C&g(x)+ CgEg(x)
We see immediately
that the particle
experiences a
"quan«m-mecha»cai"
potential, U(x) = (—&/2~) &'&/
E, which
fluctuates
with
angular
frequency,
m=(E~
—E2)/5, and that the energy of this particle, E=—BS/
BI,, and its momentum
y= V'S, fluctuate
with the same
angular
frequency.
If the particle
happens
to enter a
region of space vrhere R is small, these Quctuations
can
become quite violent. We see then that, in general, the
orbit of a particle in a nonstationary
state is very ir-
regular
and complicated,
resembling
Brovrnian
motion
more closely than it resembles
the smooth
track of a
planet around
the sun.
If the system is isolated,
these Quctuations
will con-
tinue forever. The result is quite reasonable,
since as is
well knovrn,
a system
can make a transition
from one
stationary
state to another
only if it can exchange
en-

DA V I D
ergy
with
some other
system.
In order to treat
the
problem
of transition
between
stationary
states,
we
must
therefore
introduce
another
system
capable
of
exchanging
energy
with the system
of interest. In this
section, we shall discuss the Franck-Hertz
experiment,
in which
t'his other
system
consists
of a bombarding
particle. For the sake of illustration,
let us suppose that
we have hydrogen
atoms of energy Eo and wave func-
tion, fe(x), which
are bombarded
by particles
that
cRn bc scatter cd lnelas'tlcRlly
leRvlng
thc atom
with
energy E and wave function, P (x).
We begin by writing
down the initial wave function,
4',(x, y, t). The incident particle, whose coordinates
are
represented
by
y must
be associated
with
a wave
packet, which can be written
as
fp(y, t)=
t e'" f(k—ke)exp( —ihk't/2m)dk.
(21)
product
@;=Ps(x)exp(
iEet—
/h) fe(y, t)
(.22)
Let us now see how this wave function
is to be under-
stood in our interpretation
of the theory. As pointed out
in Sec. 6, the wave function is to be regarded as a mathe-
matical
representation
of a six-dimensional
but
ob-
jectively real held, capable of producing
forces that act
on the
particles.
We also
assume
R six-dimensional
representative
point,
described
by the coordinates
of
the two particles, x and y. We shall now see that when
the combined
wave
function
takes
the form
(22) in-
volving a product of a function
of x and a function of y,
the six-dimensional
system
can correctly
be regarded
as being made up of two independent
three-dimentional
subsystems.
To prove this, we write
Pe(x) =Re(x)expLiSo(x)/h]
and
fe{y, t)=Me(y, t)expt i.V,(y, t)/h j
We then obtain for the particle velocities
dx/dt= (1/m) V'Sp(x);
dy/dt = (1/m) V'Ee(y, t),

Thus,
the particle

one involving
only
x and
the other
involving
only y. This means that the particles

The center of this packet occurs where
the phase has

as a function of k, or where y= hkot/m
Now,
as in the usual
interpretation,
me begin
by
writing
the incident
wave function
for the combined
system as a
ently.
Moreover,
the probability
density,
P=Ees(x)
XMos{y, t), is a Product of a function
of x and a func-
tion of y, indicating
that the distribution
in x is sta-
tistically
independent
of that in y. We conclude,
then,
that whenever
the wave function
ean be expressed
as a
product of two factors, each involving
only the coordi-
nates of a single system, then the two systems are com-
pletely independent
of each other.
As soon as the wave packet in y space reaches the
neighborhood
of the atom,
the two systems
begin to
interact. If we solve Schroedinger's
equation
for the
combined
system,
we obtain a.wave function
that ean
be expressed
in terms of the following series:
%'=+,+P„P„(x)exp(—iE„t/h) f„(y, t),
(25)
where the f„(y, t) are the expansion
coefficients
of the
complete
set of functions, P„(x). The asymptotic

of the wave function

wave
function,

It is clear that because the speed depends
on the hy-

atom quantum
number,
n, every
one of these
packets
will
eventually
be
separated
by
distances
which
are so large that
this separation
is classically
describable.
When
the wave
function
takes the form
(25), the
two particles
system must be described
as a single six-
dimensional
system and not as a sum of two independent
three-dimensional
subsystems,
for at this time,
if we
try to express
the wave
function
as 'f(x, y)=R(x, y)

we find. that
the resulting
expres-
sions for R and 5 depend
on x and y in a very compli-
cated way. The particle

R'(x, y) can no longer
be written
as a product
of a
function
of x and a function
of y, from which
we con-
clude that the probability
distributions
of the two par-
ticles are no longer statistically
independent.
Moreover,
the motion
of the particle
is exceedingly
complicated,
because
the
expressions
for R and S are
somewhat
analogous
to those obtained
in the simpler
problem
of
a nonstationary
state
of a single
particle
{ see Eqs.
(19) and (20)].In the region where the scattered waves
P„(x)f„(y, t) have an amplitude
comparable
with that
of the incident
wave, $0(x)fo(y, t), the functions R and
S, and therefore
the "quantum-mechanical"
potential
and the particle
momenta,
undergo
rapid
and violent
fluctuations,
both as functions
of position
and of time.
Because the quantum-mechanical
potential has R(x, y, t)
in the
denominator,
these
fluctuations
may
become
very large in this region where R is small. If the particles
happen to enter such a region, they may exchange very
large
quantities
of energy
and
momentum
in a very
short
time,
even
if the
cls,ssical potential,
V(x, y) is
very small. A small value of V(x, y) implies,
however,
a correspondingly
small
value
of the scattered
wave
amplitudes, f„(y, t). Since the fluctuations
become large
only in the region where the scattered
wave amplitude
is comparable
with
the incident
wave
amplitude
and
since the probability
that
the particles
shall
enter a
given
region of x, y space is proportional
to R'(x, y),
it is clear that a large transfer
of energy is improbable
(although
still always
possible)
when
V(x, y) is small.
While
interaction
between
the
two particles
takes
place then, their orbits are subject to wild fluctuations.
Eventually,
however,
the behavior
of the system quiets
down
and becomes
simple
again. For after the wave
function takes its asymptotic
form (26), and the packets
corresponding
to different
values
of
m have
obtained
classically
describable
separations,
we can deduce that
because
the probability
density
is
~P~', the outgoing
particle must enter one of these packets and stay with
that packet thereafter
(since it does not enter the space
between
packets
in which
the probability
density
is
negligibly
different
from zero). In the calculation
of the
particle velocities, Vi—
—V,S/rN,
V2—
—'7„5/m, and of the
quantum-mechanical
potential,
U= (—k'/2mR) (V','R
+V'„'R), we can therefore
ignore all parts of the wave
.
function
other
than
the
one actually
containing
the
outgoing
particle. It follows that the system acts as if
it had the wave function

X
g.(8, y, k)dk(2, 9)
where e denotes
the packet
actually
containing
the
outgoing
particle.
This
means
that
for all practical
purposes
the complete
wave function
(26) of the sys-
tem may be replaced by Eq. (29), which corresponds
to
an atomic electron in its eth quantum
state, and to an
outgoing
particle with a correlated
energy, E„'=k'k„'/
2'. Because the wave function
is a product
of a func-
tion of x and a function
of y, each system
once again
acts independently
of the other. The wave function can
now be renormalized
because the multiplication
of 4„
by a constant
changes
no physically
significant
quan-
tity,
such as the particle
velocity
or the "quantum-
mechanical"
potential.
As shown
in Sec. 5, when
the
electronic
wave
function
is f„(x)exp( —iE„t/k),
its
energy must be E„.Thus, we have obtained
a descrip-
tion of how it comes about that the energy
is always
transferred
in quanta
of size E —Ep.
It should
be noted that while the wave packets are
still separating,
the electron
energy
is not quantized,
but has a continuous
range of values,
which fluctuate
rapidly. It is only the final value of the energy, appear-
ing after the interaction
is over that must be quantized.
A similar
result
is obtained
in the usual interpretation
if one notes that because of the uncertainty
principle,
the energy
of either
system
can become
definite
only
after enough
time has elapsed to complete
the scatter-
ing process. '5
In principle,
the actual packet entered
by the out-
going particle could be predicted
if we knew the initial
position of both particles and, of course, the initial form
of the wave function of the combined system. "In prac-
tice, however,
the particle orbits are very complicated
and very sensitively
dependent
on the precise values of
these initial positions. Since we do not at present know
how
to measure
these
initial
positions
precisely,
we
cannot actually
predict
the outcome
of such an inter-
action process. The best that we can do is to predict
the probability
that an outgoing particle enters the mth
packet within
a given range of solid angle,
dD, leaving
the hydrogen
atom in its eth quantum
state. In doing
this,
we use the fact that
the probability
density
in
x, y space is ~P(x, y) ~' and that as long as we are re-
stricted to the mth packet, we can replace the complete
wave
function
(26) by the wave
function
(29), corre-
sponding
to the packet that actually
contains
the par-
ticle. Now,
by definition,
we have J'~P„(x)~'dx=1.
The remaining
integration
of
exp {iLk„r—(hk„'/2m) t$}
~~ f(k—1,)
g.(e, y, k)dk
r
over the region of space corresponding
to the eth out-
going
packet
leads,
however,
to precisely
the
same
probability
of scattering
as would
have been obtained
by
applying
the
usual
interpretation.
We conclude,
then,
that if P satisfies
Schroedinger's
equation,
that
if v= VS/m, and that if the probability
density
of par-
ticles is P(x, y) =R'(x, y), we obtain
in every respect
"See reference 2, Chapter
18, Sec. 19.
"Note
that
in
the
usual
interpretation
one
assumes
that
gothing determines
the precise outcome of an individual
scattering
process. Instead,
one assumes that all descriptions
are inherently
and unavoidably
statistical
(see Sec. 2).

DA VI D BOB M
exactly the same physical
predictions
for this problem
as are obtained
when we use the usual interpretation.
There remains
only one more problem;
namely,
to
show
that
if the
outgoing
packets
are subsequently
brought
together by some arrangement
of matter that
does not act on the atomic electron, the atomic electron
and the scattered
particle
will
continue
to act inde-
pendently. '" To show that these two particles
will con-
tinue to act independently,
we note that in all practical
applications,
the outgoing
particle
soon interacts
with
some
classically
describable
system.
Such a system
might consist, for example, of the host of atoms of the
gas with which it collides or of the walls of a container.
In any case, if the scattering
process is ever to be ob-
served,
the
outgoing
particle
must
interact
with
a
classically
describable
measuring
apparatus.
Now
all
classically
describable
systems
have the property
that
they contain an enormous
number
of internal
"thermo-
dynamic" degrees of freedom that are inevitably
excited
when the outgoing
particle
interacts
with
the system.
The wave
function
of the
outgoing
particle
is then
coupled
to that of these internal
thermodynamic
de-
grees of freedom,
which
we represent
as yi, y2,
~
~ y,.
To denote this coupling,
we write the wave function for
the entire system as
+=K.-4-(x)exp( —~&-~/&)f-(y y4 y2 "3 )
(30)
Now,
when
the wave
function
takes
this
form,
the
overlapping
of difFerent packets in y space is not enough
to produce
interference
between
the different f„(x).
To obtain
such interference,
it is necessary
that
the
packets f„(y, yi, y2,
y,) overlap
in every one of the
S+3 dimensions,
y, yi, y2
y.. The reader will readily
convince
himself, by considering
a typical case such as
a collision of the outgoing
particle
with a metal mall,
that it is overwhelmingly
improbable
that two of the
packets f (yi, yi, y2
y,) will overlap
with regard
to
every one of the internal
thermodynamic
coordinates,
yi, y2,
~
y„even
if they
are
successfully
made
to
.overlap
in y space. This is because each packet corre-
sponds to a difFerent particle velocity and to a difFerent
time
of collision
with
the
metal
wall.
Because
the
myriads
of internal
thermodynamic
degrees of freedom
are so chaotically
complicated,
it is very likely that as
each of the e packets interacts
with
them, it will en-
counter
difFerent conditions,
which
will make the com-
bined wave packet f„(y, yi,
.y,) enter very different
regions
of y~, yg.
~ .y, space.
Thus,
for all practical
purposes,
we can ignore the possibility
that if two of the
packets are made to cross in y space, the motion either
of the atomic electron or of the outgoing
particle
will
be afFected."

be noted that exactly the same problem
arises in
the usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory for (reference 16),
for whenever
two packets
overlap,
then even in the usual inter-
pretation,
the system must be regarded as, in some sense, covering
the states
corresponding
to both

8. PENETRATION
OF A BARRIER
According
to classical physics, a particle
can never
penetrate
a potential
barrier
having
a height
greater
than the particle kinetic energy. In the usual interpreta-
tion of the quantum
theory, it is said to be able, with
a small probability,
to "leak" through
the barrier. In
our interpretation
of the quantum
theory, however,
the
potential
provided
by the Schroedinger
P-field enables
it to "ride" over the barrier, but only a few particles are
likely to have trajectories
that carry them all the way
across without
being turned
around.
We shall
merely
sketch
in general
terms
how
the
above results can be obtained.
Since the motion of the
particle is strongly
a&ected by its f-field, we must first
solve
for this
fjeld
with
the
aid of "Schroedinger's
equation. " Initially,
we have a wave packet incident
on the potential
barrier;
and because
the probability
density
is equal to ~f(x) ~', the particle is certain to be
somewhere
within
this wave packet. When
the wave
packet strikes the repulsive
barrier,
the P-field under-
goes rapid changes which can be calculated" if desired, ,
but whose precise form does not interest us here. At this
time, the "quantum-mechanical"
potential,
U= (—h'/
2m)V'Z/Z,
undergoes
rapid
and violent
fluctuations,
analogous
to those
described
in Sec. 7 in connection
with Eqs. (19), (20), and (25). The particle orbit then
becomes
very complicated
and, because
the potential
is time dependent,
very sensitive
to the precise initial
relationship
between the particle position and the center
of the wave packet. Ultimately,
however,
the incident
wave packet disappears
and is replaced by two packets,
one of them a refiected packet and the other a trans-
mitted packet having a much smaller intensity.
Because
the probability
density
is ~f~', the particle
must
end
up in one of these packets. The other packet can, as
shown
in Sec. 1', subsequently
be ignored.
Since the
reflected packet
is usually
so much
stronger
than
the
transmitted
packet,
we conclud. e that during
the time
when
the packet
is inside
the barrier,
most
of the
particle orbits must be turned around, as a result of the
violent
Quctuations
in
the
"quantum-mechanical"
potential.
9. POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS
IN
MATHEMATICAL
FORMULATION
LEADING TO EXPERIMENTAL
PROOF THAT NEW INTERPRETATION
IS NEEDED
We have already
seen in a number
of cases and in
Paper II we shall prove in general, that as long as we
have
obtained
classically
describable
separations,
then,
both in
the usual interpretation
and in our interpretation
the probability
that there will be significant
interference
between them is so over-
whelmingly
small
that it may
be compared
to the probability
that a tea kettle placed on a 6re will happen to freeze instead
of
boil. Thus, we may for all practical
purposes
neglect
the possi-
bility of interference
between
packets
corresponding
to the dif-
ferent possible energy states in which the hydrogen
atom may be
left.'9 See, for example, reference 2, Chapter 11,Sec. 17, and Chapter
12, Sec. 18.

that f satisfies

that

and that we have a statistical

of the quantum

leads to physical
results that are identical
with those obtained

adopting
our interpretation
instead
of the usual
one
could therefore
come only from experiments,
such as
those involving
phenomena
associated with distances of
the order of 10 "cm or less, which are Qot now ade-
quately
understood
in terms of the existing theory. In
this paper we shall not, however,
actually
suggest any
speci6c experimental
methods of distinguishing
between
our interpretation
and the usual one, but shall conhne
ourselves
to demonstxating
that such experiments
are
conceivable.
Now'» thcI'c Rrc Rn IQ6nlte number
of wRys of Inodlfy-
ing the mathematical
form of thc theory that are con-
sistent with our interpretation
and not with the usual
interpretation.
We shall conhne ourselves here, however,
to suggesting
two such modi6cations,
which
have
al-
ready been indicated
in Sec. 4, namely,
to give up the
assumption
that v is necessarily
equal to VS(x)/m, and
to give
up
the
assumption
that P must
necessarily
satisfy a homogeneous
linear
equation
of the general
type suggested by Schroedinger.
As we shall see, giving
up either of those first two assumptions
will in general
also require us to give up the assumption
of a statistical
ensemble
of particles,
with a probability
density
equal
to lk(x) I'.
Ke begin by noting
that it is consistent
with
our
interpretation
to modify
the equations
of motion of a
particle
(Sa) by adding
any conceivable
force term to
the right-hand
side. Let us, for the sake of illustration,
consider
a force that
tends
to make
the
diGcrence,
p—V'5(x), decay rapidly
with time, with a mean decay
time of the order of v=10 ia/c seconds,
where c is the
velocity of light. To achieve this result,
we write
d'x
h2
V2E.
=—V I (x)—
+f{p—VS(x)),
(31)
dP
2m E
where f(p—VS(x)) is assumed
to be a function
which
vanishes
when
p=V'5(x)
and
more
generally
takes
sich a form that it implies
a force tending
to make
p—VS(x) decrease
rapidly
with
the passage
of time.
It is clear, moreover,
that f can be so chosen that it is
lRI'ge only
ln ploccsscs lnvolvlng
vcI'y sholt dlstanccs
(where V'S(x) should be large).
If the correct equations
of motion resembled Eq. (31),
then the usual interpretation
wouM be applicable
only
over times much
l.onger than ~, for only after such times
have elapsed
will the relation p= V'5(x) be a good ap-
proximation.
Moreover,
it is clear that such modifica-
tions
of the theory
cannot
even be described
in the
usual interpretation,
because they involve the precisely
dehnable
particle
variables
which
are not postulated
in the usual interpretation.
Let us now consider a modihcation
that makes
the
equation
governing
P inhomogeneous.
Such a modifica-
tion lS

Here, H is the usual Hamiltonian
operator, x;,represents
the actual location of the particle,
and
P is a function
that
vanishes
when
p=V'5(x;). Now,
if the particle
equations
are chosen, as in Eq. (31),to make p—V'5(x,)

processes,
the
inhomogeneous
term
in Eq. (32) will
become negligibly
small, so that Schroedinger's
equation
is a good
approximation.
Nevertheless,
in processes
involving
very short distances and very short times, the
inhomogeneities
would
be important,
and
the P-field
wouM,

to some
extent
on the actual
location
of the
particle.
It is clear that Eq. (32) is inconsistent
with the usual
interpretation
of the theory.
Moreover,
we can con-
template
further
generalizations
of Eq. (32), in the
dixection of introducing
nonlinear
terms that are large
only for processes
involving
small distances.
Since the
usual
interpretation
is based
on
the
hypothesis
of
linear
superposition
of "state vectors"
in a Hilbert
space, it follows that the usual interpretation
could not
be made consistent with such a nonlinear
equation for a
one-particle
theory. In a many-particle
theory,
opera-
tors can be introduced,
satisfying a nonlinear
generaliza-
tion of Schroedinger's
equation;
but these must
ulti-
mately
operate on wave functions
that satisfy a linear
homogeneous
Schroedinger
equation. .
Finally,
we repeat a point already
made
in Sec. 4,
namely,
that if the theory is generalized
in any of the
ways indicated here, the probability
density of particles
will cease to equal
~P(x) ~'. Thus,
experiments
would
become
conceivable
that
distinguish
between
~P(x)~'

interpretation,
