Preface
Preface
In this volume I present some examples of Simple Diﬀerential Equations II, cf. also Calculus 1a,
Functions of One Variable. Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some solution strategy I have
as far as possible structured the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Linear diﬀerential equations of second order and of constant
coeﬃcients
Example 1.1 Given the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R.
A student has found the solutions x = et and x = 2et, and he claims that these are the only ones.
How can one from the existence and uniqueness theorem alone conclude that this statement is wrong?
A. A theoretical question about a linear diﬀerential equation of second order.
D. Review the existence and uniqueness theorem.
I. According to the existence and uniqueness theorem there are for any given vector (t0, x0, v0) pre-
cisely one solution x = ϕ(t), for which
ϕ(t0) = x0,
ϕ′(to) = v0.

We shall therefore be able to solve the systems of equations
et0 = x0,
et0 = v0,
or
2et0 = x0,
2et0 = v0,
which of course cannot be done in general.
What is wrong is tat the two given solutions are linearly dependent, so they only deﬁne a 1-
dimensional set of solutions. The order of the equation is 2, so the set of solutions must have
dimension 2. Furthermore, we have not retrieved all linear combinations of et, so we see that there
are lots of errors in the statement above by this student.
Example 1.2 For a diﬀerential equation of the form
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R,
it is claimed that x = sin t and x = 1
2 sin 2t are both solutions. Prove from the existence and uniqueness
theorem, that this is wrong.
A. An application of the existence and uniqueness theorem.
D. Choose t = 0, and show that sin t and 1
2 sin 2t take on the same value and that the same is true
for their derivatives at t = 0.
I. Let ϕ(t) = sin t and ψ(t) = 1
2 sin 2t. Then ϕ′(t) = cos t and ψ′(t) = cos 2t. For t = 0 we get
(ϕ(0), ϕ′(0)) = (0, 1) = (ψ(0), ψ′(0)),
hence ϕ and ψ are two diﬀerent solutions through the same line element. This is according to the
existence and uniqueness theorem not possible.
Example 1.3 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = 0,
t ∈R.
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Start by ﬁnding the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
I. The characteristic polynomial is
R2 −3R + 2 = (R −1)(R −2).
The roots R = 1 and R = 2 are simple, so the complete solution is
c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.

Example 1.4 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −6 dx
dt −16x = 0,
t ∈R.
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
I. The characteristic polynomial
R2 −6R −16 = (R −3)2 −52 = (R −8)(R + 2)
has the roots R = −2 and R = 8. Thus, the complete solution is
x = c1e−2t + c2e8t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Example 1.5 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + 2 dx
dt + 5 x = 0,
t ∈R.
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Solve the characteristic equation.
I. The characteristic equation R2 + 2R + 5 = 0 has the roots R = −1 ± 2i, so the complete solution is
x = c1e−t cos 2t + c2e−t sin 2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Example 1.6 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −2 dx
dt + 17 x = 0,
t ∈R.
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Solve the characteristic equation and set up the solution.
I. Obviously, the characteristic polynomial R2 −2R + 17 has the two simple roots R = 1 ± 4i. Thus,
the complete solution is
x = c1et cos 4t + c2et sin 4t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.

Example 1.7 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = 0,
t ∈R.
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. This ex-
ample is almost identical with Example 1.3, the only diﬀerence being that we here require all the
complex solutions.
D. Apply Example 1.3, or ﬁnd the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 −3R + 2 has the two simple roots R = 1 and R = 2. Thus, all
complex solutions are
x = c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈C,
t ∈R.
Example 1.8 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −6 dx
dt + 9x = 0,
t ∈R.
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Solve the characteristic equation, and then set up the solution.
I. The characteristic equation R2 −6R+9 = (R−3)2 has the double root R = 3, hence, the complete
solution is
x = c1e3t + c2te3t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Example 1.9 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(1) c d2x
dt2 −2 dx
dt + x = 0,
where c is a positive real number.
1) Find for 0 < c < 1 that solution x = ϕc(t) of (1), for which ϕc(0) = 1 and ϕ′
c(0) = 1.
2) Find for c = 1 that solution x = ϕ1(t) of (1), for which ϕ1(0) = 1 and ϕ′
1(0) = 1.
3) Let t ∈R be ﬁxed. Is it true that ϕc(t) →ϕ1(1), when c →1?
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients, where one
of the coeﬃcients can change independently of t. Check the behaviour of a solution during a limit
process with respect to this coeﬃcient (a parameter).
D. For given c we ﬁnd the roots of the characteristic equation. Then set up the solution.
I. The characteristic equation cR2 −2R + 1 = 0, c > 0, has the solutions
R = 1

2) When c = 1, then the characteristic equation R2 −2R + 1 = (R −1)2 = 0, has the double root
R = 1. The complete solution is
x = c1et + c2tet
where
dx
dt = (c1 + c2)et + c2tet.
It follows from
ϕ1(0) = 1 = c1
and
ϕ′
1(0) = 1 = c1 + c2,
that c1 = 1 and c2 = 0, so the solution is
ϕ1(t) = et.
3) We get by the limit process c →1−in (2),
lim
c→1−ϕc(t) = 1
2 et + 1
2 et = et = ϕ1(t),
so we obtain ϕ1(t) by this limit process.
Example 1.10 Consider the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R.
We get the extra information that the functions
sin t + 2et
and
sin t + et −e−t
are both solutions. Find the complete solution based on this information.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant, though unknown
coeﬃcients. However, we are given two solutions. Find the complete solution.
D. When we take the diﬀerence of the two solutions, we get a solution of the corresponding homoge-
neous equation. Put this into the left hand side of the equation.

I. The subtraction gives that
2ϕ1(t) = (sin t + 2et) −(sin t + et −e−t) = et + e−t = 2 cosh t
is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, thus
ϕ1(t) = cosh t
is also a solution. Then by insertion into the left hand side of the equation we get
d2ϕ1
dt2 + a1
dϕ1
dt + a0 ϕ1(t) = (a0 + 1) cosh t + a1 sinh t = 0.
Now, cosh t and sinh t are linearly independent, so we must have a0 = −1 and a1 = 0. We have
now reduced the equation to
d2x
dt2 −x = q(t).
Then the complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation is given by
c1 cosh t + c2 sinh t,
c1, c2 ∈R.
Then we insert the solution sin t + 2et, which gives that
q(t) = −sin t −sin t = −2 sin t,
and the equation is
d2x
dt2 −x = −2 sin t,
and its complete solution is
x = −2 sin t + c1 cosh t + c2 sinh t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Example 1.11 Consider the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R,
where we get the information that the functions
t2 + e−t cos t
and
t2
are both solutions. Find the coeﬃcients a1 and a0, and the function q(t).
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant, though unknown
coeﬃcients. There are given two solutions. One shall ﬁnd the constants and the right hand side
q(t).
D. First ﬁnd a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
When this is put into the
homogeneous equation we derive a1 and a0. Finally, insert t2 in order to get q(t).

I. The equation is linear, so the diﬀerence x = e−t cos t must be a solution of the corresponding
homogeneous equation. From
x = e−t cos t,
dx
dt = −e−t(cos t + sin t),
d2x
dt2 = 2e−t sin t,
we get
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0x = (−a1 + a0)e−t cos t + (2 −a1)e−t sin t = 0.
Now, e−t cos t and e−t sin t are linearly independent, so we must necessarily have −a1 + a0 = 0
and 2 −a1 = 0, and thus a0 = a1 = 2. The equation can now be written
d2x
dt2 + 2 dx
dt + 2x = q(t).
By insertion of x = t2 we get
q(t) = 2t2 + 4t + 2 = 2(t + 1)2,
and the equation becomes
d2x
dt2 + 2 dx
dt + 2x = 2(t + 1)2.
The corresponding complete solution is
x = t2 + c1e−t cos t + c2e−t sin t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Example 1.12 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + 3 dx
dt + 2x = et,
t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic equation. Then guess a particular solution.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 + 3R + 2 = (R + 1)(R + 2) has the simple roots R = −1 and
R = −2. The corresponding homogeneous equation therefore has the complete solution
c1e−t + c2e−2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Since the right hand side is not a solution of the homogeneous equation, we guess a particular
solution of the form x = c · et. Then by insertion
d2x
dt2 + 3 dx
dt + 2x = 6c et.
This expression is equal to et for c = 1
6. Thus, the complete solution is
x = 1
6 et + c1e−t + c2e−2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.

Example 1.13 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x

t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial and then the complete solution of the corresponding
homogeneous equation. Then guess a polynomial of third degree as a particular integral.
I. The characteristic equation R2 −6R + 9 = (R −3)2 = 0 has the double root R = 3, hence the
corresponding homogeneous equation has the complete solution
x = c1e3t + c2te3t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
When we put x = at3 + bt2 + ct + d into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x
dt2 −6 dx
dt + 9x
= 9(at3 + bt2 + ct + d) −6(3at2 + 2bt + c) + (6at + 2b)
= 9at3 + (9b −18a)t2 + (9c −12b + 6a)t + (9d −6c + 2b).

This is equal to t3, if

d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = 2t2 + 3,
t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial; guess a polynomial as a particular solution.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 −3R + 2 = (R −1)(R −2) has the simple and real roots R = 1
and R = 2. The complete solution of the homogeneous equation is then given by
c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈C,
t ∈R,
cf. Example 1.3 or Example 1.7.
When x = at2 + bt + c is put into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x
=
2(at2 + bt + c) −3(2at + b) + 2a
=
2at2 + (2b −6a)t + (2c −3b + 2a).
This is equal to 2t2 + 3, when
2a = 2,
2b −6a = 0,
2c −3b + 2a = 3.
Thus a = 1, b = 3 and c = 5. The complete solution is
x = t2 + 3t + 5 + c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈C,
t ∈R.

We shall give a MAPLE programme of sketching the graph of the most obvious particular solution,

MAPLE programmes are rarely unique. Here, I have used the commands

t ∈R,
for which ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ′(0) = 1.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Solve the characteristic equation and put x = c · eit.
I. The characteristic equation R2 + 2R + 2 = 0 has the roots R = −1 ± i, so the complete solution of
the homogeneous equation is
c1e−t cos t + c2e−t sin t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
If x = c · eit is put into the left hand side of the equation, we get

dt + 2x = c(−1 + 2i + 1)eit = c(1 + 2i)eit,

1 + 2i = −1 + 2i. Hence we insert
x = Im{(−1 + 2i)(cos t + i sin t)} = 2 cos t −sin t,
from which we get Im{−5eit} = −5 sin t, and the complete solution is
ϕ(t) = 2 cos t −sin t + c1e−t cos t + c2e−t sin t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R,

so
ϕ′(t) = −cos t −2 sin t + (−c1 + c2)e−t cos t + (−c1 −c2)e−t sin t.
It follows from the initial conditions that
ϕ(0) = 0 = 2 + c1,
dvs.
c1 = −2,
ϕ′(0) = 1 = −1 −c1 + c2,
dvs.

Example 1.17 Find a solution of each of the diﬀerential equations below:
1) d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = e−t, t ∈R.
2) d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = 1 + t, t ∈R.
3) d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = e−t + 1 + t, t ∈R.
A. On the left hand side we have the same linear diﬀerential operator of second order and of constant
coeﬃcients. Notice that it is the same diﬀerential operator as in Example 1.3, Example 1.7 and
Example 1.14.
The three right hand sides are diﬀerent, though (3) is obtained by an addition of (1) and (2), so
we can get a solution of (3) by superposition.
D. In all three cases we are only requested to give one solution. Start by solving the characteris-
tic equation, and then give the complete solution of the homogeneous equation. Finally, guess
systematically a particular solution.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 −3R+2 = (R−1)(R−2) has the simple roots R = 1 and R = 2,
so the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
1) When we put x = c · e−t into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = c(1 + 3 + 2)e−t = 6ce−t = e−t
for c = 1
6. The complete solution is
x = 1
6 e−t + c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
2) When we put x = at + b into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt + 2x = −3a + 2at + 2b = 2at + (2b −3a),
which is equal to 1 + t for a = 1
2 and b = 5
4. The complete solution is
x = 1
2 t + 5
4 + c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
3) Due to the linearity and the results of (1) and (2) we immediately get the complete solution
x = 1
2 t + 5
4 + 1
6 e−t + c1et + c2e2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.

Example 1.18 Find a solution of each of the diﬀerential equations below:
1) d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 8x = e2t cos 2t, t ∈R.
2) d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 8x = cos t, t ∈R.
3) d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 8x = 2e2t cos 2t −3 cos t, t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. The same
homogeneous equation. Only one solution is wanted in each case.
D. Even if it is not requested, we shall nevertheless ﬁnd the complete solution of the homogeneous
equation. Then:
1) Put x = c · e(2+2i)t, and take the real part.
2) Put x = c · eit, and take the real part.
3) Choose some linear combination of the solutions of (1) and (2).
I. The (simple) roots of the characteristic polynomials R2 + 4R + 8 = (R + 2)2 + 22 are R = −2 ± 2i,
hence the homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1e−2t cos 2t + c2e−2t sin 2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
1) If we put
x = c · e(2+2i)t = c · e2(1+i)t
into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 8x
=
c

22(1 + i)2 + 4 · 2(1 + i) + 8

e(2+2i)t
=
c {4i + 8 + 4i + 8}e(2+2i)t = 8c(2 + i) e(2+2i)t,
which is equal to e2(1+i)t for c = 1
8 ·

2 + i = 2 −i
40 . Thus, a solution is
Re
 1
40 (2 −i)e(2+2i)t

= 1
40 e2t {2 cos 2t + sin 2t}.
2) When we put x = c · eit into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 8x = c(−1 + 4i + 8)eit = c(7 + 4i)eit,
which is equal to eit for c =
1
7 + 4i = 1
65 (7 −4i). Hence a solution is
Re
 1
65 (7 −4i)eit


65 {7 cos t + 4 sin t}.

3) Since 2e2t cos 2t −3 cos t is equal to two times the right hand side of (1) minus three times the
right hand side of (2), it follows from the linearity that a solution is given by
1
20 e2t {2 cos 2t + sin 2t} −3
65 {7 cos t + 4 sin t}.
In all three cases we obtain the complete solution by adding all solutions of the homogeneous
equation to the particular solution.
Example 1.19 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt −4x = −sin t + e2t + 1,
t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial and thus ﬁnd the complete solution of the homo-
geneous equation. Then guess systematically a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation,
and ﬁnally use superposition.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 −3R −4 has the roots

4,

hence the homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1e−t + c2e4t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
If we put x = c · eit, we get
d2x
dt2 −3 dx
dt −4x = c(−1 −3i −4)eit = c(−5 −3i)eit,
which is equal to −eit for c =

5 + 3i = 5 −3i

. We therefore obtain the result −sin t = Im(−eit)
for
x = Im

If we put x = c · e2t, we get
d2x

dt −4x = c(4 −3 · 2 −4)e2t = −6ce2t = e2t
for c = −1
6. We obtain the result e2t for x = −1
6 e2t.
If we put x = −1
4, we get the result 1.
From the linearity we conclude that the complete solution is given by
1
34 {5 sin t −3 cos t} −1

t ∈R,
where c1, c2 ∈R are arbitrary constants.

A. Boundary value problem for a linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of

any particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation. Then the complete solution is given by
ϕ(t) = ϕ0(t) + c1e2t + c2e−3t,

Then insert the boundary conditions (this only means that we shall insert diﬀerent values of t,
here t = 0 and t = 1),
 ϕ(0) = a = ϕ(0) + c1 + c2,
ϕ(1) = b = ϕ0(1) + c1e2 + e2e−3,
From these equations we get the following system of linear equations for the constants c1 and c2,


Since

we conclude that to any given constants a, b ∈R there is one and only one solution (c1, c2) ∈R2,
and the claim is proved.
Example 1.21 Consider a diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −4 dx
dt + 5x = q(t),
t ∈R.
Prove that for any given constants a, b ∈R there exists precisely one solution x = ϕ(t) of the
diﬀerential equation, for which ϕ(0) = a and ϕ(1) = b.
A. Boundary value problem for a linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of
constant coeﬃcients, where the right hand side has not been speciﬁed.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial and apply the structure of the complete solution.
Then insert the boundary conditions and prove that the solution is unique.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 −4R + 5 has the two simple roots 2 ± i. Therefore, if ϕ0(t) is
any particular solution, then the complete solution of the inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation is
given by
ϕ(t) = ϕ0(t) + c1e2t cos t + c2e2t sin t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
When we apply the boundary conditions we get the equations
ϕ(0) = a = ϕ0(0) + c1,
dvs.
c1 = a −ϕ0(0),
and
ϕ(1) = b = ϕ0(0) + c1e2 cos 1 + c2e2 sin 1.
Now, e2 sin 1 ̸= 0, so we get
c2 =

and both c1 and c2 are uniquely determined by the conditions, and the claim is proved.

Example 1.22 Consider the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −4 dx
dt + 5x = cos t,
t ∈R.
Let a and b be two real numbers. How many solutions x = ϕ(t) of the diﬀerential equation satisfy
ϕ(0) = a and ϕ(2π) = b?
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Start by ﬁnding the roots of the characteristic polynomial, and ﬁnd the complete solution of the
homogeneous equation. Since cos t = Re eit, we ﬁrst guess (in a complex form) of a particular
solution of the form x = c·eit. Finally, we apply the boundary conditions on the complete solution
and analyze.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 −4R + 5 has the simple roots R = 2 ± i, hence the homogeneous
equation has the complete solution
c1e2t cos t + c2e2t sin t.
If we put x = c · eit into the left hand side of the equation we get

dt + 5x = c(−1 −4i + 5)eit = 4c(1 −i)eot,
which is equal to eit for c = 1

8 sin t.
The complete solution is
ϕ(t) = 1
8 cos t −1
8 sin t + c1e2t cos t + c2e2t sin t.
From the given boundary value condition follows that
ϕ(0) = a = 1
8 + c1,
ϕ(2π) = b = 1
8 + c1e4π.
This gives
c1 = a −1

c1 = e−4π

Here we have two possibilities:

e4πa ̸= b + 1
8{e4π −1},
then there is no solution.

and we can choose c2 arbitrarily, and we conclude that we have inﬁnitely many solutions.
Example 1.23 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 4x = sin 2t,
t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. The characteristic polynomial R2 + 4R + 4 = (R + 2)2 has the double root R = −2, hence the
complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation is
c1e−2t + c2te−2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
If we put x = αe2it into the left hand side of the equation, then
α

(2i)2 + 4 · 2i + 4

e2it = α · 8i · e2it,
which is equal to e2it for α = −i
8. A particular solution of the original equation is
Im

= −1
8 cos 2t.
The complete solution is
x = −1
8 cos 2t + c1e−2t + c2te−2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Alternatively we may guess on a real solution as a linear combination of cos 2t and sin 2t. If
so, then
x
=
a cos 2t + b sin 2t,

4a cos 2t + 4b sin 2t,

d2x
dt2
=
−4a cos 2t −4b sin 2t,
d2x
dt2

−4a cos 2t −4b sin 2t.
It follows from the right hand column by an addition that
d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 4x = 8b cos 2t −8a sin 2t.
This is equal to sin 2t, if a = −1
8 and b = 0, thus a particular solution is −1
8 cos 2t.
The complete solution is
x = −1
8 cos 2t + c1e−2t + c2te−2t,

I. The characteristic polynomial R2 + 2R + 1 = (R + 1)2 has the double root R = −1, so the

(2B−A) sin2 t+4(A−B) sin t cos t+(2A−B) cos2 t.
If this should be equal to sin2 t, then we must have
2B −A = 1,
A −B = 0,
2A −B = 0,
thus A = B = 2B, or A = B = 0, while also 2B −A = 1. These two conditions cannot be
fulﬁlled at the same time, so the guess is wrong.

t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of third order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial; guess a particular solution.
I. It follows immediately the the characteristic polynomial R3 + 3R2 + 4R −8 has the root 1, so we
get the factorization
R3 + 3R2 + 4R −8 = (R −1)(R2 + 4R + 8) = (R −1){(R + 2)2 + 22}.
The simple roots are R = 1 and R = −2 ± 2i, and the complete solution of the homogeneous
equation is
c1et + c2e−2t cos 2t + c3e−2t sin 2t,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Since 6et cos 2t = Re

6e(1+2i)t

Then by insertion,

=
(−24a + 18b)et cos 2t + (−18a −24b)et sin 2t.
This is equal to 6et cos 2t, if

−24a + 18b = 6,
−18a −24b = 0,
dvs.

−4a + 3b = 1,
3a + 4b = 0,
so a = −4

The characteristic polynomial R2−6R+9 = (R−3)2 has the double root R = 3, so the corresponding
homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1e3t + c2t e3t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
According to (1) the right hand side of the equation is equal to sin 3t. Now, if we put x = α · e3it
into the left hand side of the equation, we get
α · (3i −3)2e3it = −18iα · e3it,
which is equal to e3it for α = −1
18i = i
18. Then a particular solution is
Im

which is easily checked. The complete solution is then
x = 1
18 cos 3t + c1e3t + c2t e3t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. The characteristic polynomial
R2 −2R + 17 = (R −1)2 + 16
has the simple roots R = 1 ± 4i, thus the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
x = c1et cos 4t + c2et sin 4t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
If we put x = α e3it into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial; guess a particular solution.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 + 4R + 4 has the double root R = −2, so the corresponding
homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1e−2t + c2t e−2t,
c1, c2 ∈R,

If we put x = α cosh t + β sinh t into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d2x

dt + 4x = (5α + 4β) cosh t + (4α + 5β) sinh t.
This is equal to cosh t, if and only if
4α + 5β = 0

Example 1.29 Consider the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R.
Is the following theorem correct or wrong:
• When t0, t1 a and b are given real numbers, where t0 ̸= t1, then there is one and only one solution
x = ϕ(t), t ∈R, such that ϕ(t0) = a and ϕ(t1) = b.
A. Boundary value problem.
D. Bet on that this is not a correct statement and construct a counterexample.
I. The equation
d2x
dt2 + x = 0,
has the characteristic polynomial R2 + 1, and thus the complete solution
x = c1 sin t + c2 cos t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
By choosing t0 = 0 and t1 = π, and a = b = 0, we get c2 = 0, while c1 can be chosen arbitrarily,
i.e. the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation is
ϕc(t) = c · sin t,
c ∈R,
where
ϕc(0) = 0
and
ϕc(π) = 0.
Thus, we do not have uniqueness, and the claim is in general wrong. There may, however, exist
special examples in which the claim is right.
Example 1.30 Which kind of function should one guess on as a solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + a dx
dt + b x = est,
t ∈R,
where s is a constant, independent of t? Under what circumstances will such a guess fail, and what
should one guess instead? What if this second guess also fails?
A. Particular solution by the method of guessing.
D. Insert x = c est and analyze.
I. The characteristic polynomial is R2 + aR + b.
1) If s is not a root of the characteristic polynomial, we guess on c · est. Then by insertion
d2x
dt2 + a dx
st + bx = c(s2 + as + b)est.
The assumption assures that s2 + as + b ̸= 0, hence this is equal to est for c =
1
s2 + as + b, and
a particular solution is in this case given by
1
s2 + as + b est.

2) If s is a root of the characteristic polynomial, we of course get zero by insertion. We must
instead guess on
x = c t est
where dx
dt = c est + cs test,
and
d2x
dt2 = 2csest + cs2t est.
We get by insertion
d2x
dt2 + a dx
dt + b x = 0 + acest + 2scest = c(a + 2s)est.
If s is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial, i.e. 2s + a ̸= 0, then we get the solution
x =
1
2s + a t est.

3) If s is a double root of the characteristic polynomial, then also 2s + a = 0, because the double
root necessarily is −a
2. In that case we guess instead on x = c t2est, and we get
dx
dt = cst2est + 2ctest
and
d2x
dt2 = cs2t2est + 4cstest + 2cest,
hence by insertion, 2cest = est for c = 1
2, and a particular solution is
x = 1
2 t2est.

A. Linear diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients.

R = 1
2 {−3 ±

=
2a + 3(2at + b) + 3
	
at2 + bt + c

Example 1.32 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(3) d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0x = 0,
t ∈R,
where the characteristic equation R2 + a1R + a0 = 0 has two complex roots R = α ± i β, β ̸= 0 with
the corresponding solutions
ϕ1(t) = eαt cos βt,
ϕ2(t) = eαt sin βt.
Prove by applying the existence and uniqueness theorem that the functions
x = c1ϕ1(t) + c2ϕ2(t),
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R,
form the complete solution of (3).
A. Linear diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. A theoretical application
of the existence and uniqueness theorem.
D. Start by recalling the existence and uniqueness theorem.
I. For any given vector (t0, x0, v0) there exists according to the existence and uniqueness theorem one
and only one solution x = ϕ(t), such that
ϕ(t0) = x0
and
ϕ′(t0) = v0.
In the given example we shall prove that one always can ﬁnd c1 and c2, such that this is fulﬁlled.
If
ϕ(t) = c1eαt cos βt + c2eαt sin βt,
then
ϕ′(t)
=

Since

αeαt sin βt+βeαt cos βt


−βeαt sin βt
βeαt cos βt
 = e2αtβ
	
cos2 βt + sin2 βt

= β e2αt ̸= 0,
we can always solve the corresponding system of equations in c1 and c2, when ϕ(t0) = x0 and
ϕ′(t0) = v0 and t = t0 are given, hence the solution is uniquely determined.

Example 1.33 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(4) d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0x = 0,
t ∈R,
where the characteristic equation R2 +a1R+a0 = 0 has the double root R = r. Thus, at least we have
the solution
ϕ1(t) = ert.
1) First prove that r = −1
2 a1.
2) Then prove by insertion that
ϕ2(t) = t ert
is a solution of (4).
3) Prove by an application of the existence and uniqueness theorem that the functions
x = c1ϕ1(t) + c2ϕ2(t),
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R,
are the complete solution of (4).
A. Linear diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients, where the characteristic
polynomial has a double root.
D. Write the characteristic polynomial in two ways and compare.
Insert ϕ2(t) and apply the existence and uniqueness theorem.
I. 1) It follows from
R2 + a1R + a0 = (R −r)2 = R2 −2r R + r2,
that a1 = −2r and a0 = r2, hence
r = −1
2 a1.
We can now write
(5) d2x
dt2 −2r dx
dt + r2x = 0,
t ∈R.
2) If we put ϕ2(t) = t ert, then
ϕ′
2(t)
=
rt ert + ert,
ϕ′′
2(t)
=
r2t ert + 2r ert,
hence
ϕ′′
2(t) −2r ϕ′
2(t) + r2ϕ2(t)
= rrt ert + 2r ert −2r2t ert −2r ert + r2t ert = 0,
and we have proved that ϕ2(t) = t ert is a solution.

3) Then let
x = ϕ(t) = c1ϕ1(t) + c2ϕ2(t) = c1ert + c2t ert.
We shall prove that if ϕ(t0) = x0 and ϕ′(t0) = v0, then c1 and c2 are unique, and the rest
follows from the existence and uniqueness theorem.
It follows from
ϕ′(t) = c1r ert + c1(1 + rt)ert,
that

c1ert0 + c2t0ert0 = ϕ0(t0) = x0,
c1r ert0 + c2(1 + rt0)ett0 = ϕ′

Remark 2. “Vielgeschrei und wenig Wolle!”, sagte der Teufel, als er seine Sau beschor! An
alternative method is the following:
The diﬀerential equation
d2y
dt2 = 0
can be solved by two successive integrations, so the complete solution is
y = c1 + c2t,
where c1, c2 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
If we put y = x e−rt, then it follows that the equation

has the complete solution y = x e−rt = c1 + c2t, i.e. x = c1ert + c2t ert, using that e−rt ̸= 0 for all
t ∈R. This means that the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 −2r dx
dt + r2x = 0,
has the complete solution
x = c1ert + c2t ert,
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R.
This proof applies the more basic fact that integrals of continuous functions are uniquely deter-
mined apart from an arbitrary constant. ♦

does not have a solution of the form x = c · et, and that (7) has a solution of the form x = c · t et,

does not have a solution of the form x = c·et or of the form c = c·t et, and that (8) has a solution

Theorem. Consider the diﬀerential equation
(9) d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0x = et,
t ∈R,
and its corresponding characteristic equation
R2 + a1R + a0 = 0.
a) If R = 1 is a root in the characteristic equation, then (9) does not have a solution of the form
x = c · et, t ∈R.
b) If R = 1 is a simple root in the characteristic equation, then (9) has a solution of the form
x = c · t et, t ∈R.
c) If R = 1 is a double root in the characteristic equation, then (9) has a solution of the form
x = c · t2et, t ∈R.
A. Linear diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients with a guideline.
D. Insert the given functions into (1) and (2). Then, we generalize in (3).
I. 1) The characteristic equation
R2 −3R + 2 = (R −1)(R −2)
has the roots R = 1 and R = 2, so the corresponding homogeneous equation has the complete
solution
c1et + c2e2t,
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R.
In particular, c1et is mapped into 0 by the diﬀerential operator, so c · et cannot be a particular
solution.
If we choose x = c · t et, then
dx
dt = c t et + c et
og
d2x
dt2 = c t et + 2 c et.

By insertion into the left hand side of the equation we get

c t et + 2 c et


c t et + c et
+ 2 c t et
=
c(1 −3 + 2)t et + c(2 −3)et = −c et,
which is equal to et for c = −1, and x0(t) = −t et is a particular solution.
2) The characteristic polynomial
R2 −2R + 1 = (R −1)2
has the double root R = 1, thus the homogeneous equation has the complete solution
x = c1et + c2t et,
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R.
In particular, c1et and c2t et are always mapped into 0 by this diﬀerential operator, and these
functions are never solutions of the inhomogeneous equation.
If x = c · t2et, then
dx
dt = c t2et + 2 c t et,
and
d2x
dt2 = c t2et + 4 c t et + 2 c et.
We get by insertion into the left hand side of the equation
d2x
dt2 −2 dx
dt + x

c t2 + 4 c t + 2 c

et −2
	
c t2 + 2 c t

et + c t2et
=
c(1 −2 + 1)t2et + c(4 −4)t et + 2 c et = 2 c et.
This is equal to et for c = 1
2, hence a particular solution is given by
x = 1
2 t2et.
3) a) If R = 1 is a root of the characteristic equation, then c·et is a solution of the corresponding
homogeneous. Therefore, it never can be a solution of the inhomogeneous equation, if the
right hand side is ̸= 0.
b) If the characteristic polynomial is
R2 + a1R + a0 = (R −1)(R −a0),
a0 ̸= 1,
then a1 = −1 −a0. If we put x = c t et, then we get
dx
dt = c t et + c et,
d2x
dt2 = c t et + 2 c et.
Then by insertion into the left hand side of the equation
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x
=
d2x
dt2 −(a0 + 1) dx
dt + a0x
=
c(t + 2)et −(a0 + 1)c(t + 1)et + a0c t et
=
c {1 −(a0 + 1) + a0} t et + c (2 −a0 −1) et = c(1 −a0)et.

Since a0 ̸= 1, this expression is equal to et for c =

, hence a particular solution is
given by
x =

t et,
and the claim is proved.
c) If R = 1 is a double root, then

dx
dt + a0x = d2x
dt2 −2 dx
dt + x = et.
We have already treated this equation in (2), so we get immediately the result.

where (r, θ) are the polar coordinates, and u = 1/r. Prove that r as a function of θ is given by

K + c1 cos θ + c2 sin θ .
We shall in the following only consider the case c2 = 0. It can be proved that this can also be achieved
by choosing the coordinate system properly. We shall now identify the curves which are described by
the equation (10). We shall assume that K > 0. Put

What is this curve called?
(3) What is the equation in rectangular coordinates in case of |e| = 1?
And what is the name of the corresponding curve?
(4) Finally, ﬁnd the equation in rectangular coordinates and the type of the curves in case of |e| > 1.
A. Linear diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. Conic sections. There are

D. Follow the guidelines.

dθ2 + u = K
has the characteristic polynomial R2 + 1 with the complex conjugated simple roots ±i. The
corresponding homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1 cos θ + c2 sin θ,
where c1, c2 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
We see that u = K is a trivial solution, so the complete solution is given by
u(θ) = K + c1 cos θ + c2 sin θ.
From u = 1
r we get
r =

K + c1 cos θ + c2 sin θ ,

1. Guessing. The right hand side q(t) = e−4t is an exponential, which is not a solution of the
corresponding homogeneous equation. We therefore guess on a solution of the form x = a e−4t.
By insertion into the left hand side of the diﬀerential equation we get
d2x
dt2 + 8 dx
dt + 15 x = 16a e−4t −32a e−4t + 15a e−4t = −a e−4t,
which is equal to e−4t for a = −1. Thus the complete solution is
x = −e−4t + c1e−3t + c2e−5t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.
2. Solution formula for linear equation of constant coeﬃcients. Let α and β be the two
(possibly equal) roots of the characteristic equation, and let q(t) be the right hand side of the
normed diﬀerential equation of second order. Then
x = eαt

e(β−alpha)t

We have two variants:
1) Choosing α = −3 (and thus β = −5) and q(t) = e−4t we get
x

e(−5+3)t

e−2t · et dt = e−3t 

2) Choosing α = −5 (and thus β = −3) and q(t) = e−4t we get
x

e(−3+5)t

e3t · e−4t dt


dt

−et
dt = −e−5t · et = −e−4t.
In both cases we obtain the complete solution
x = −e−4t + c1e−3t + c2e−5t,
c1, c2 ∈R,
t ∈R.

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. Cf. also

D. Solve the characteristic polynomial. Guess a particular solution.
I. The characteristic polynomial R2 +6R+25 = (R+3)2 +42 has the simple and complex conjugated

c1e−3t cos 4t + c2e−3t sin 4t,

We see that the right hand side of the equation is a solution of the homogeneous equation. We
therefore guess on c · t e2t. However, this function is also a solution of the homogeneous equation,
so we must change our guess to x = c · t2e2t. Then

2) The characteristic polynomial R6 + 9R4 + 24R2 + 16 can be considered as an equation in the
new variable U = R2. We see that R2 + 1 is a divisor. Then we get the factorization
R6 + 9R4 + 24R2 + 16 = (R2 + 1)(R4 + 8R2 + 16) = (R2 + 1)(R2 + 4)2.
Thus the complex roots are ±i (simple roots) and ±2i (double roots). The complete solution

Remark. The characteristic polynomial R3 +3R2 +3R+1 = (R+1)3 has the treble root R = −1,
hence the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
c1e−t + c2te−t + c3t2e−t,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Then the complete solution of the original inhomogeneous equation is
x = 1
32 et sin 2t −1
32 et cos 2t + c1e−t + c2te−t + c3t2e−t,
where c1, c2, c3 ∈R are arbitrary constants, and t ∈R.
Example 2.5 Given for the diﬀerential equation
d3x
dt3 + a2
d2x
dt2 + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R,
that the functions
et −et cos t
and
et + 3e−t
are both solutions. Find the complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of third order and of constant coeﬃcients. The con-
stants and the right hand side are not known; but we are given two solutions of the inhomogeneous
equation. Apparently we have got too little information, so the task requires a theoretical analysis.
D. Exploit that the diﬀerence between the two solutions is a solution of the corresponding homoge-
neous equation. Insert this diﬀerence into the left hand side of the equation and then calculate
the coeﬃcients. When we have found a2, a1 and a0, then the rest is easy.
The solution below is given in three sections, of which (2) concerning the uniqueness is obligatory,
and where only one of the points (1) concerning the existence is necessary.
I. 1) The diﬀerence
x = (et + 3e−t) −(et −et cos t) = 3e−t + et cos t,
is a solution of the homogeneous equation, ant the coeﬃcients are constant. This gives us the
idea the the three linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation are given by
e−t,
et cos t,
et sin t,
corresponding to the characteristic polynomial
(R + 1)(R −1 −i)(R −1 + i) = (R + 1)(R2 −2R + 2) = R3 −R2 + 2,
hence to the diﬀerential equation
(13) d3x
dt3 −d2x
dt2 + 2x = q(t).
First assume that the equation is given by (13). Then we obtain q(t) by putting x = et into
the left hand side of the equation, thus q(t) = 2et, and the equation becomes
(14) d3x
dt3 −d2x
dt2 + 2x = 2et.

Clearly, the complete solution of (14) is given by
x = et + c1e−t + c2et cos t + c3et sin t,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R,
t ∈R,
and we see that the given solutions et −et cos t and et + 3e−t are among these. This proves the
existence of such an equation.
2) The uniqueness is far from obvious, since we have only the knowledge of two solutions, and we
shall ﬁnd three constants and the function q(t). Therefore the problem apparently lacks some
information.
It will later turn up that the assumption that the coeﬃcients are constant (they may be complex
in the following), and the information that
et cos t = Re

e(1+i)t
occurs in the solution actually secures that
et sin t = Im

e(1+i)t
also must occur in the solution. In fact:
We know that
x = 3e−t + et cos t = 3e−t + Re

e(1+i)t
is a solution of the homogeneous equation. We shall now see what this means. First we calculate
dx

−3e−t + Re

(1 + i)e(1+i)t

thus by insertion

= 3(a0 −a1 + a2 −1)e−t
+(−2 + a1 + a0)et cos t + (−2 −2a2 −a1)et sin t,
where we see that the term et sin t turns up.

proving the uniqueness.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

3) If we did not start with the very intuitive point (1), then we proceed in the following way:
The corresponding characteristic polynomial
R3 −R2 + 2 = (R + 1)(R2 −2R + 2)
has the simple roots R = −1 and R = 1 ± i, hence the complete solution of the homogeneous
equation is
c1e−t + c2et cos t + c3et sin t,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Now, et −et cos t is a solution of the equation, and et cos t is a solution of the homogeneous
equation. This shows that x = et is a particular solution. When it is put into the left hand
side of the equation, we obtain
q(t) = d3x
dt3 −d2x
dt2 + 2x = et −et + 2et = 2et,
and the equation becomes
d3x
dt3 −d2x
dt2 + 2x = 2et,
where the complete solution is
et + c1e−t + c2et cos t + c3et sin t,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R,
t ∈R.
Example 2.6 For the diﬀerential equation
d4x
dt4 + a3
d3x
dt3 + a2
d2
d2t + a1
dx
dt + a0 x = q(t),
t ∈R,
we get the information that the functions
cos t,
cos t + 2 sin 2t −cos 2t,
cos t −et + 3e−t
are all solutions. Find the numbers a0, a1, a2, a3 and the function q(t).
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of fourth order and of (unknown) constant coeﬃcients
and an unknown right hand side. We know three solutions of the inhomogeneous equation. Find
the constants and the right hand side. Note that the complete solution is not requested.
D. The diﬀerence of any two of the given solutions must be a solution of the corresponding homoge-
neous equation. Insert these solutions and ﬁnd the coeﬃcients. Finally we insert one solution in
order to get q(t).
I. It is ﬁrst seen that the two diﬀerences
{cos t + 2 sin 2t −cos 2t} −cos t = 2 sin 2t −cos 2t,
and
{cos t −et + 3e−t} −cos t = −et + 3e−t,

are both solutions of the homogeneous equation. Then a qualified guess is that the characteristic
polynomial must contain the factors R2 + 4 (corresponding to c1 cos 2t + c2 sin 2t) and R2 −1
(corresponding to c3et + c4e−t), thus the characteristic polynomial is probably given by
(R2 + 1)(R2 −1) = R4 + 3R2 −4,
corresponding to
d4x
dt4 + 3 d2x
dt2 −4x = q(t).
If we insert the solution x = cos t, we get in this case
q(t) = cos t −3 cos t −4 cos t = −6 cos t.
We may therefore expect that the equation is
(15) d4x
dt4 + 3 d2x
dt2 −4x = −6 cos t,
which has the complete solution
cos t + c1 cos 2t + c2 sin 2t + c3et + c4e−t,
t ∈R,
where c1, c2, c3, c4 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
Notice that (15) clearly satisﬁes the conditions, so we have at least found one solution.
We shall now prove that the model above is unique. If we insert a solution of the homogeneous
equation
x
=
2 sin 2t −cos 2t,
dx
dt
=
2 sin 2t + 4 cos 2t,

2(16−4a3−4a2+a1+a0) sin 2t −(16+16a3−4a2−4a1+a0) cos 2t.

Put b1 = a0 −4a2 and b2 = a1 −4a3. Then
b1 = a0 −4a2 = −16,
b2 = a1 −4a3 = 0.
Then let
x = −et + 3e−t = d2x
dt2 = d4x
dt4 ,
and

from which
d4x

−(1 + a2 + a0 + a3 + a1)et + 3(1 + a2 + a0 −a3 −a1)e−t.
Since et and e−t are linearly independent, this is 0, if and only if
 (1 + a2 + a0) + (a3 + a1) = 0,
(1 + a2 + a0) −(a3 + a1) = 0,
hence
a1 + a3 = 0
and
a0 + a2 = −1.
We shall now only solve the four equations

a0
−
4a2

a0

a2


a1 = 4a3,
a1 = −a3,
from which it is seen that a1 = a3 = 0, and −5a2 = −15, thus a2 = 3 and a0 = −4. Therefore we
get precisely
d4x
dt4 + 3 d2x
dt2 −4x = q(t),
hence by insertion of the solution x = cost of the inhomogeneous equation we get q(t) = −6 cos t,
and the equation becomes
d4x
dt4 + 3 d2x
dt2 −4x = −6 cos t,
so we have proved the uniqueness.

Example 2.7 Given the complete solution of an inhomogeneous linear diﬀerential equation of order
n,
x = c1 cos 2t + c2 sin 2t + c3 + c4t + t2,
t ∈R.
Find n and the equation.
A. From the information of the complete solution of a linear inhomogeneous equation of unknown
order n, though of constant coeﬃcients, we shall ﬁnd the order n and reconstruct the diﬀerential
equation.
D. First ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial, and then insert the particular solution.
I. Since we have four arbitrary constants, the order must be n = 4.
Since cos 2t = Re e2it and sin 2t = Im e2it are solutions of the homogeneous equation, the factor
R2 + 4 must occur in the characteristic polynomial.
Since 1 = e0·t and t = t · e0·t are solutions of the homogeneous equation, we must have the double
root R = 0 in the characteristic polynomial, so R2 is also a factor in the polynomial.

When we collect these things we see that the characteristic polynomial is
(R2 + 4)R2 = R4 + 4R2,
corresponding to the linear diﬀerential equation of fourth order and of constant coeﬃcients
d4x
dt4 + 4 d2x
dt2 = q(t).
Since x = t2 is a solution of the inhomogeneous equation, we must have
q(t) = d4x
dt4 + 4d2x
dt2 = 8,
and the equation becomes

dt2 = 8.

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of third order and of constant coeﬃcients. This exam-

solution.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
Then write the solution of the homogeneous
equation. Finally, guess a complex solution in the form c · e(1+2i)t, and then take the real part.
I. The characteristic polynomial R3 + 3R2 + 3R + 1 = (R + 1)3 has the treble root R = −1, hence
the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
c1e−t + c2te−t + c3t2e−t.
If we put x = c · e(1+2i)t into the left hand side of the equation, we get

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁfth order and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial and set up the solution of the homogeneous equa-
tion. Then guess systematically, where we note that one of the terms on the right hand side is
already a solution of the homogeneous equation.
I. The characteristic polynomial R5 + 4R4 = (R + 4)R4 has the simple root R = −4 and the fourfold
root R = 0. Hence the homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1 + c2t + c3t2 + c4t3 + c5e−4t,
t ∈R,
where c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
If we put x = c · e2it into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d5x
dt5 + 4 d4x
dt4 = c

result 3 sin 2t, when we choose
x = Im
 3
80 (1 −2i)e2it

= 3
80 {sin 2t −2 cos 2t}.
If we put x = 1, t, t2, t3 into the left hand side of the equation, we of course get 0. If we instead
put x = c · t4, then we can expect to get a constant, and if we put x = c · t5, we can expect to get
a polynomial of ﬁrst degree. Therefore, our guess is
x = at5 + bt4.
Then by insertion
d4x
dt4 = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 at + 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 b = 120at + 24b

dt5 = 120a,
thus

dt5 + 4 d4x

This is equal to t, if a =

120a + 96b = 1
4 + 96b = 0,
i.e.
b = −1

A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of fourth order and of constant coeﬃcients. Find the
constant α, such that a given function is a solution.
D. Put x = c · eiαt and see when we get a solution. Although it is not required, we shall nevertheless
ﬁnd the complete solution, just for the practice.

When α ̸= ±1, then α4 −1 ̸= 0. Thus, if we choose c =

α4 −1, then we get the result eiαt.
Corresponding to this the solution becomes
x =
1
α4 −1 sin αt,
α ± 1.
When α = ±1, the right hand side sin αt is also a solution of the homogeneous equation, hence a
solution, which is independent of the ﬁrst one, must contain the additional factor t, so it cannot
be of the desired structure.
Remark. Complete solution. The characteristic polynomial
R4 −1 = (R2 −1)(R2 + 1) = (R −1)(R + 1)(R2 + 1)

where c1, c2, c3, c4 ∈R are arbitrary constants.

dx

Find the condition for that any two solutions ϕ(t) and ψ(t),
ϕ(t) −ψ(t) →0
for t →∞.
A. Find a condition for that all solutions of the homogeneous equation tend to 0 for t →+∞.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
I. By a complex factorization (the fundamental theorem of algebra) we get the characteristic polyno-
mial
Rn + an−1Rn−1 + · · · + a1R + a0 = (R −r1)(R −r2) · · · (R −rn).
If r ∈{r1, . . . , rn} is a simple root, r = r′ + ir′′, then a solution of the homogeneous equation is
ert = er′teir′′t = er′t{cos r′′t + i sin r′′t}.
Now
eir′′t = 1, so the condition is er′t →0 for t →+∞, i.e. Re r < 0.

If r is a multiple root of multiplicity k > 1, then we must at least have Re r < 0. Since the solution
corresponding to r is a linear combination of
ert, tert, . . . , tk−1ert,
and since the exponential dominates the power functions, this condition is also suﬃcient.
The condition is that every root in the characteristic polynomial has negative real part. (This
condition is both necessary and suﬃcient).
Example 2.13 Consider the diﬀerential equation
d4x
dt4 + 5 d3x
dt3 + 13 d2x
dt2 + 19 dx
dt + 10 x = sin 2t,
t ∈R.
Prove that there exists precisely one solution which is periodic of period π, and ﬁnd this solution.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of fourth order and of constant coeﬃcients. Find a
periodic solution.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
Prove that no solution of the homogeneous
equation is periodic. Finally, ﬁnd a solution by the complex method.
I. The characteristic polynomial
R4 + 5R3 + 13R2 + 19R + 10
is positive for R ≥0, so the only possible rationale roots can only be found among the numbers
−1, −2, −5, −10. By trial and error,
R = −1 :
R4 + 5R3 + 132 + 19R + 10 = 1 −5 + 13 −19 + 10 = 0,
R = −2 :
R4 + 5R3 + 13R2 + 19R + 10 = 16 −40 + 52 −38 + 10 = 0,
proving the R = −1 and R = −2 are roots. Then
(R + 1)(R + 2) = R2 + 3R + 2
is a divisor in the characteristic polynomial. By division we get
R4 + 5R3 + 13R2 + 19R + 1 == (R + 1)(R + 2)(R2 + 2R + 5),
and we see that all roots are
R = −1,
R = −2,
R = −1 ± 2i.
These are all simple. Due to the exponential factor, none of the corresponding solutions of the
homogeneous equation (linear combinations of
e−t,
e−2t,
e−t cos 2t,
e−t sin 2t, )
can be periodic.

Example 2.14 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d4x

dt3 −2 d2x
dt2 + 8t = t4 −3t2 −5t + 2,
t ∈R.
A. Linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of order 4 and of constant coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial; then write down the solution of the homogeneous
equation; ﬁnally, guess a particular solution.
I. The possible rational roots of the characteristic polynomial
R4 −2R3 −2R2 + 8
are R = ±1, ±2, ±4 and ±8.
Clearly, R = ±1 is not a root, because R4 −2R2 −2R2 is odd for R = ±1. Furthermore, 32 is a
divisor in R4 −2R3 −2R2, when R = ±4 or R = ±8, so we can also exclude these possibilities.
Therefore, it remains only R = ±2. By a calculation
R = 2 :
R4 −2R3 −2R2 + 8 = 16 −16 −8 + 8 = 0,
proving that R = 2 is a root. Then by a division by a polynomial we get the factorization
R4 −2R3 −2R2 + 8 = (R −2)(R3 −2R −4) = (R −2)2(R2 + 2R + 2),
and we see that the roots are R = 2 (double root) and the two simple roots R = −1 ± i.
Hence, the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
c1e2t + c2t e2t + c3e−t cos t + c4e−t sin t,
t ∈t,
where c1, c2, c3, c4 ∈R are arbitrary constants.

A. Roots of a polynomial of fourth degree. Computation of a complex number. A linear inhomoge-
neous diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcient.
D. The polynomial of degree four is a polynomial of degree two in the new variable w = z2.
The characteristic polynomial is equal to the given polynomial. The roots are given in (1). From
et cos t = Re

e(1+i)t
follows that (2) can be applied when we shall ﬁnd a particular solution of
the inhomogeneous equation-
I. 1) When w = z2 we get
P(z) = z4 + 6z2 + 25 = w2 + 6w + 25 = (w + 3)2 + 16.
Thus, the roots are
w = z2 =

−3 + 4i = 1 + 2 · 2i −22 = (1 + 2i)2,
−3 −4i = 1 −2 · 2i −22 = (1 −2i)2,
so we ﬁnd the four roots
1 + 2i,
1 −2i,
−1 + 2i,
−1 −2i.
2) By insertion we get
P(1 + i) = (1 + i)4 + 6(1 + i)2 + 25 = −4 + 12i + 25 = 21 + 12i = 3(7 + 4i).
3) According to (1) the roots of the characteristic polynomial are
1 + 2i,
1 −2i,
−1 + 2i,
−1 −2i.
Then the corresponding homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1et cos 2t + c2et sin 2t + c3e−t cos 2t + c4e−t sin 2t.

The corresponding inhomogeneous complex equation is of the form

Let us guess on x = a e(1+i)t. Then by (2),

dt2 + 25 x = P(1 + i)a e(1+i)t = 3(7 + 4i)a e(1+i)t.

t ∈R,
where c1, c2, c3 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
The corresponding complex equation is
d3x
dt3 + 8x = e3it.
If we put x = a e3it into the left hand side of the equation, we get
d3x
dt3 + 8x = a

(3i)3 + 8

e3it = 8{8 −27i}e3it,
which is equal to e3it for
a =

8 −27i = 8 + 27i
82 + 272 =

793{8 + 27i}.
Then a solution of the corresponding real equation is

Re

793 (8 + 27i)(cos 3t + i sin 3t)


793{8 cos 3t −27 sin 3t}.
The complete solution of the original equation is

+c2et cos(

t ∈R,
where c1, c2, c3 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
2) Since we have two constraints and three arbitrary constants, we must have an inﬁnity of
solutions. Now,
x =

793{8 cos 3t −27 sin 3t} + c1e−2t + c2et cos(

I. The characteristic polynomial
R3 −4R2 + R −4 = (R −4)
	
R2 + 1

has the three simple roots R = 4 and R = ±i, so the homogeneous equation has the complete
solution
c1e4t + c2 cos t + c3 sin t,
t ∈R,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R.
If we then put x = at2 + bt + c, we get by insertion

dt2 + dx
dt −4x
= −4 · 2a + b + 2at −4at2 −4bt −4c
= −4at2 + (2a −4b)t −8a + b −4c.
This is equal to 8t2 + 15, when
−4a = 8,
2a −4b = 0,
−8a + b −4c = 15,
so a = −2, b = 1
2 a = −1 and
c = 1
4 (−8a + b −15) = 1

Thus, a particular solution is −2t2 −t.
All things considered we obtain the complete solution

t ∈R,
where c1, c2, c3 ∈R are arbitrary constants.

Figure 3: A mechanical system, where the mass m to the right is under inﬂuence of a force F(t),

Example 4.1 Two physical phenomena are indicated on the ﬁgures above.
In the ﬁrst case we consider a mass m, which moves along the x-axis. The mass is under the inﬂuence
of a force of a spring k, a damper of constant c and an external force F(t), which we here choose as

In the second case we consider an electric circuit consisting of a coil of induction L, a resistance R,
a capacitor of capacity C, and a voltage generator of voltage V (t). We choose here V (t) = V0 sin ωt.
We shall consider the following problems in the two cases.
In the ﬁrst case we want to ﬁnd the
displacement of the mass x(t) from equilibrium, and in the second case we want to ﬁnd the voltage
Vc(t) measured over the capacitor. These two tasks are from a mathematical point of view identical,
i.e. the mathematical model is the same in the two cases. We shall not here derive how we get to this
model.
1) First prove that both diﬀerential equations can be written
(20) d2x
dt2 + 2α dx
dt + ω2
0 x = f · cos ωt,
t ∈R.
Here α ≥0, and we assume that ω > 0.
2) Consider the case where the external force is 0. This corresponds to F0 = V0 = 0, hence
(21) d2x
dt2 + 2α dx
dt + ω2
0 x = 0,
t ∈R.
Find the condition for that a solution of (21) can be 0 inﬁnitely often, and ﬁnd in this case the
complete solution of (21).

In the other two cases, only the zero solution is 0 inﬁnitely often.
3) Then consider
d2x

The characteristic polynomial R2 + ω2

by

t sin ω0t + c1 cos ω0t + c2 sin ω0t,

c1, c2 ∈R.
4) The special case is of course ω = ω0, where the complete solution is
f

t sin ω0t + c1 cos ω0t + c2 sin ω0t,
t ∈R,

This means that it is also possible to obtain the solution for ω = ω0 by a limit process.
The solutions of the homogeneous equation are the natural eigenfunctions of the system, so the
phenomenon only means that the external force is in resonance with the eigenfunctions. We
note that t sin ω0t oscillates between ±t, so the maximum grows to inﬁnity, when t tends to
inﬁnity.

Example 4.2 Let us return to the electric circuit of Example 4.1. Assume that V (t) = V0 cos ωt, and
that we want to ﬁnd the voltage Vc. It can be proved that we have for given Vc(t),
LC d2Vc
dt2 + RC dVc
dt + Vc = V0 cos ωt.
Assuming all this we consider the diﬀerential equation
(23) d2x
dt2 + 2α dx
dt + ω2
0 x = f · cos ωt,
t ∈R,
where all constants are positive. Let x0(t) denote the solution which is obtained by the complex method
of solution.
1) Find A(ω), such that x0(t) can be written
x0(t) = A(ω) cos(ωt0ϕ(ω)),
where the exact value of ϕ(ω) is not required.
2) Find for every value of α and ω0, the maximum of A(ω), ω > 0, and the value of ω, for which we
get this maximum.
A. Linear diﬀerential equation of second order and of constant coeﬃcient. The complex method of
solution is requested.
D. Put x = c · eiωt, ﬁnd c, and put x0(t) = Re x(t).

Example 4.3 Let us assume the same model as in Example 4.1. Consider the diﬀerential equation
(24) d2x
dt2 + 2α dx
dt + ω2
0 x = f · cos ωt,
t ∈R,
where the constants α, ω0 and ω are all positive.
Let x0(t) denote the solution which is obtained by the complex method of solution.
1. Prove that x0(t) can be written
x0(t) = A(ω) cos(ωt + ϕ(ω)),
t ∈R,
where
A(ω) =
f

(ω2
0 −ω2)2 + (2αω)2 .
2. Prove that for every solution x(t) of (24),
x(t) −x0(t) →0
for t →+∞.
Due to the result in (2) we are mostly interested in the solution x0(t). For ﬁxed ω let x0(t) denote
an oscillation of the amplitude A(ω). This amplitude therefore depends of the frequency of the angle
ω on the right hand side of (24). Considered as a function in ω we call A(ω) the characteristics of
amplitude of the diﬀerential equation (or of the corresponding physical system).
3. Find the maximum of A(ω), ω > 0, and the value of ω, for which this maximum is attained.
(One shall be very careful here and the right time distinguish between the two cases.)
A. Linear diﬀerential operator of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. Amplitude. There are
some similarities with Example 4.2.
D. Solve the equation by the complex method. Prove that every solution of the corresponding ho-
mogeneous equation tends to 0. Find the maximum of the amplitude.
I. 1) If we put x = c · eiωt into the left hand side of the equation, we get
	
−ω2 + 2iαω + ω2

which is equal to f · eiωt for

(ω2
0−ω2)2+(2αω)2 .
2) For every solution x(t) of (24) we have that x(t) −x0(t) is a solution of the corresponding
homogeneous equation. the characteristic polynomial is
R2 + 2αR + ω2
0 = (R + α)2 + ω2
0 −α2.

−α ± i

ω2

for α < ω0.
Clearly, Re R < 0 in the latter two cases. Since

α2 −ω2
0 < α, this is also true in the ﬁrst
case, so
eRt = et Re R →0
for t →+∞,
because Re R < 0, and the claim is proved.
3) The function A(ω) attains its maximum, when

ψ′(ω) = 2(ω2 −ω2
0) · 2ω + 8α2 · ω = 4ω

ω2 −ω2
0 + 2α2
.
Here, we distinguish between the two cases:
a. ω2
0 ≤2α2,
b. ω2
0 > 2α2.
a) If ω2
0 ≤2α2, then ω2 −ω2
0 + 2α2 > 0 for ω > 0, hence ψ′(ω) > 0 for ω > 0. The minimum
is attained for ω = 0, corresponding to

Example 4.4 A particle of mass m moves in the (x, y)-plane under the inﬂuence of the force F = k·ˆv,
where k is a constant, and v denotes the velocity of the particle. The force F is therefore always

Example 4.5 On the ﬁgure is shown a setting up, where a horizontal disc is turned with a constant
velocity of the angle Ω. the mass m moves frictionless in a pipe which is ﬁxed on the disc, and k is the
resistance of the spring. Let x(t) denote the oscillation of the mass from equilibrium. The constants k
and m are in the following kept ﬁxed, and the movement of the mass then only depends on the velocity
of the angle Ω. It can be proved that we as a mathematical model can use the diﬀerential equation

a few possibilities, which should be indicated.

2) If Ω =

m, then the solutions are
x = c1 + c2t,
t ∈R,

If c1 = 0, the movement of the particle is damped, i.e. it tends to the position of rest x = 0 for
t →+∞.
If c1 ̸= 0, then |x(t)| tends exponentially towards +∞.
In practice, none of the unbounded solutions can be realized, because the spring will be torn
into pieces for large t > 0.

Example 4.6 Consider a shaft, which is supported in its two end points. These are described on the
oriented shaft by x = 0 and x = ℓ, where ℓdenotes the length of the shaft. When the shaft rotates, it
can under certain conditions rotate in a bent form.
Figure 7: Sketch of a rotating shaft with the bending u(x).
the diﬀerential equation for the bending u of a rotating shaft is
(28) (EI) d4u
dx4 −
pω2
g

u = 0,
where p indicates the weight per length, and ω the constant velocity of the angle, and g the gravity,
and E the module of elasticity of the shaft, and ﬁnally, I a cross section constant. The diﬀerential
equation only gives a good description for a small bending.
1. Find the complete solution of (28).
That the shaft can rotate in a bent form can be proved to be equivalent to that (28) has a solution
which is not the zero solution, where

We call the values of ω, for which this phenomenon occur for the critical velocities of the angle.
In the rest of this example we shall ﬁnd these velocities of the angle. Therefore, consider a solution
u(x) of (28).
2. Prove that the conditions u(0) = u′′(0) are satisﬁed, if and only if u(x) can be written
u(x) = d1 sin(kx) + d2 sin(kx),
for some constants d1 and d2, where k is referring back to (28).
3. Then prove that if u(ℓ) = u′′(ℓ) = 0, then d1 = 0, and then ﬁnd the critical velocities of the angle.

From u(0) = u′′(0) = 0 we get

Example 4.7 A cable, which is fastened in two points, is hanging under the inﬂuence of its own
weight. Place a usual (x, y)-coordinate system such that the origo lies at the lowest point of the cable
and such that the x-axis has the same direction as the tangent at this point. By a consideration of the

Example 4.8 Consider a beam of length ℓ, which is clamped at its left end point, while it in its right
end point is under the inﬂuence of a pressure P. Let u(x) denote the bending of the beam (cf. the
ﬁgure).
Figure 8: A clamped beam under inﬂuence of a pressure P from the right.
It turns up that the beam is only bending due to the force P in some special situations. We shall
discuss this by using the mathematical model of the diﬀerential equation
(30) d4u
dx4 + P d2u
dx2 = 0,
0 ≤x ≤ℓ,
P > 0,
where for every bending u(x),
(31) u(0) = 0,
u′′(0) = 0,
u(ℓ) = 0,
u′′(ℓ) = 0.
We shall take all this for granted in the following.
1) First ﬁnd the complete solution of (30).
2) Then ﬁnd all solutions of (30), for which the conditions in (31) are also fulﬁlled.
3) Find those values of P, for which the beam is bending, i.e. where u(x) is not identically zero, and
ﬁnd the corresponding bending u(x).
A. Linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of fourth order and of constant coeﬃcients. There are
given some guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines (the characteristic polynomial etc.).
I. 1) The characteristic polynomial
R4 + PR2 = R2(R2 + P),
P > 0,
has the roots
R = 0
(double root)
and
R = ±i
√
P,
so the complete solution of (30) is
u(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cos(
√
P x) + c4 sin(
√
P x),
x ∈[0, ℓ],
where c1, . . . , c4 ∈R are arbitrary constants.

2) If
u(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cos(
√
P x) + c4 sin(
√
P x),
then
d2u
dx2 = −c3P cos(
√
P x) −c4P sin(
√
P x).
Then by insertion into (31),
u(0) = 0 = c1 + c3,
u′′(0) = 0 = −c3P,
thus c3 = c1 = 0, and it only remains
u = c2x + c4 sin(
√
P x),
d2u
dx2 = −c4P sin(
√
P x).
If u(ℓ) = u′′(ℓ) = 0, we clearly get c2ℓ= 0, i.e. c2 = 0, so the possible solutions are
u = c · sin(
√
P x),
where
u′′(ℓ) = 0 = −cP sin(
√
P ℓ).
Since c ̸= 0 for a bending, we must have sin(
√
P · ℓ) = 0. This condition means that
√
P · ℓ= nπ,
i.e.
P =
nπ

n ∈N.
3) According to (2) the solution is only diﬀerent from the zero function, if

Example 4.9 Consider a beam of length ℓ, which is clamped at its left end point, while it at its right
end point is under the inﬂuence of a pressure P. Let u(x) denote the bending of the beam, cf. the
ﬁgure. Unlike Example 4.8 we here assume that the bending has a horizontal tangent at the left end
point.
Figure 9: A clamped beam experiencing a pressure from the right.
We use as a mathematical model the diﬀerential equation
(32) d4u
dx4 + P d2u
dx2 = 0,
0 ≤x ≤ℓ,
P > 0,
where for every bending u(x),
(33) u(0) = 0,
u′(0) = 0,
u(ℓ) = 0,
u′′(ℓ) = 0.
We shall take the above for granted in the following.
1) Find the complete solution of (32).
2) A real bending of the beam corresponds to an non-zero solution u(x) of (32), for which the condi-
tions (33) are fulﬁlled. Prove that this only is possible, if
tan(

P ℓ) =

P ℓ.
3) Find every possible bending of the beam.
A. Same diﬀerential equation as in Example 4.8, i.e. a linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of
fourth order and of constant coeﬃcients. Only the boundary conditions have changed. There are
given some guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) This is the same question as (1) in Example 4.8.
The characteristic polynomial

Example 4.10 Consider a disc, which rotates with a constant velocity of the the angle Ω. An elastic
rod is fastened in one of its end points to the periphery of the disc, while there in the other end point
is a particle of mass 1. We shall furthermore assume that the length of the rod is 1. We denote by
x(ℓ) the deviation of the rod from the diameter of the disc (cf. the ﬁgure).
Figure 11: Rotating disc with an elastic rod fastened to its periphery.
The radius of the disc is r. When the disc rotates, the rod will (only) bend for some values of Ω.
For simplicity we shall only consider that situation, where the bending x(ℓ) fulﬁls x(1) = 0.1. As a
mathematical model we shall use the diﬀerential equation
(34) d3x
dℓ3 + Ω2 (r −1) dx
dℓ= Ω2 · 0, 1,
0 ≤ℓ≤1,
and for a bending where x(1) = 0.1 we shall also require that
(35) x(0) = 0,
x′(0) = 0,
x′′(1) = 0,
x(1) = 0, 1.
1) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation (34) in each of the cases r < 1, r = 1 and
r > 1.
2) Let us consider the case r < 1. First ﬁnd the complete solution of (34) by means of the hyperbolic
functions. Then prove that (34) has a solution which satisﬁes the conditions (35), only if the
velocity of the angle Ω satisﬁes
tanh(Ω
√
1 −r) = r Ω
√
1 −r.
A. I found this example in some book on Calculus, and I must say for one that I feel quite uneasy
with the physical model. In the original example the condition of the bending was x(1) = 1,
which means that the rod is always perpendicular of the diameter! When I pointed this out to the
authors, the condition was changed to x(1) = 0.1. This is still wrong, because we must assume
that the bending is perpendicular to the diameter, and the most natural thing would be to place
the coordinate system along the diameter. This violates the geometry of the problem! In fact,
draw the cord between the particle and the point of the rod on the periphery. Then this cord is
clearly shorter than the length 1 of the rod, and on the other hand it is also the hypothenuse of a
rectangular triangle, in which one of the shorter sides (given by the projection of the particle onto
the diameter) is 1. This is not possible in Euclidean geometry.

Finally, we must consider the possibility of the coordinate axis to follow the elastic rod. But then
the condition x(1) = 0.1 on the particle implies that it must move on a line parallel with the
diameter in the distance of 0.1, so there must be a groove here. I can ﬁnd nothing of the kind in
the example, so this is an unhappy example of a mathematical model where the requirement of
being solvable forces the authors to even violate the Euclidean geometry.
Let us forget the physical model, which apparently cannot be repaired in a reasonable way, and
instead turn to the mathematical task which still has a well-deﬁned meaning, and which can
be solved. We have a linear inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of third order and of constant
coeﬃcients.
D. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial in the three cases r < 1, r = 1 and r > 1. Guess
a solution.
I. 1) The characteristic polynomial is
R3 + Ω2 · (r −1) R = R

R2 + Ω2 · (r −1)

.
a) If 0 < r < 1, then the roots are
R = 0
and
R = ±Ω
√
1 −r,
and the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
x(ℓ) = c1 + c2 cosh(Ω
√
1 −r ℓ) + c3 sinh(Ω
√
1 −r ℓ),
ℓ∈[0, 1],
where c1, c2, c3 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
We immediately guess the particular solution x =
ℓ
10(1 −r), so the complete solution is
x(ℓ) =
ℓ
10(1 −r) + c1 + c2 cosh(Ω
√
1 −r ℓ) + c3 sinh(Ω
√
1 −r ℓ).
b) If r = 1, then R = 0 is a treble root, so the homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1 + c12ℓ+ c3ℓ2,
ℓ∈[0, 1],
c1, c2, c3 ∈R.
We guess the particular solution x = c · ℓ3. Then if follows from (34) that 6c = −0, 1 · Ω2,
i.e. c = −1
60 Ω2, and the complete solution is
x(ℓ) = −1
60 Ω ℓ3 + c1 + c2ℓ+ c3ℓ2,
ℓ∈[0, 1],
c1, c2, c3 ∈R.
c) If r > 1, then the roots are
R = 0
R = ±i Ω
√
1 −r,
and a particular solution is x = −
ℓ
10(r −1). Thus the complete solution is
x(ℓ) = −

10(r −1) + c1 + c2 cos(Ω

r −1 ℓ) + c3 sin(Ω

r −1 ℓ),
where ℓ∈[0, 1], and where c1, c2, c3 ∈R are arbitrary constants.

2) Let r < 1. According to (1a) above, the complete solution of (34) is
x(ℓ) =

√
1 −r ℓ) + c3 sinh(Ω
