Greeks and Chinese each independently postulated thousands of years ago 
that there must be a small number of elemental substances from which all 
other things were created as admixtures. Remarkably, both civilizations

the elements experimentally. Lavoisier‚Äôs discovery is often cited as the event 
that heralded the birth of chemistry as a proper science. Theorizing based on 
observation of natural systems began to give way to controlled testing of the 
properties of matter, leading to an explosion of understanding, the echoes of 
which are still ringing in modern-day laboratories.
Organic chemistry is the subject dedicated to the study of a deceptively 
simple set of molecules‚Äîthose based on carbon. Even today, centuries 
after the most basic governing principles of this subject were discovered, 
many students struggle to make sense of this science. At the university 
level, professors are often in a race against time to dispense the vast body 
of knowledge on organic chemistry to their students before semester‚Äôs end, 
leaving little time for discussion of exactly how this information came to be 
known or of just how new experimentation might change the world we live

elements grew, one of the simplest of them‚Äîcarbon‚Äîseemed to play 
a very special and indispensable role in many small molecules. This was 
particularly true of the molecules harvested from living organisms. So 
obvious was the importance of this role that chemists dubbed the study of the 
fundamental molecules of life ‚Äúorganic chemistry,‚Äù a science that today has

reactive sites on molecules, but always providing structural support for an 
ever-growing library of both naturally occurring and man-made compounds.
Other elements will join the story, bonding with carbon scaffolds to create 
compounds with a stunningly broad array of properties. Most notable are the 
elements hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and bromine. The presence 
of these elements and others in organic chemistry spices up the party, but 
none of them can replace carbon in its central role.
The goal of this course is to take the uninitiated student on a tour of the 
development and application of the discipline of organic chemistry, noting 
some of the most famous minds to dedicate themselves to this science in 
the past few centuries, such as Dmitry Mendeleev (of periodic table fame), 
Friedrich W√∂hler (the father of modern organic chemistry), and Alfred Nobel

functional groups, and ultimately the ways in which the bonds in these 
functional groups form and break in chemical reactions that can be used to 
convert one compound into another.
Next, you will apply that understanding of organic fundamentals to more 
complex, but often misunderstood, molecular systems, such as starches,

creations in the laboratory, investigating techniques as ancient as distillation 
and as modern as nuclear magnetic studies.
After completing this course, the successful student will have all of the 
tools needed to have a meaningful dialogue with a practicing organic 
chemist about the theory behind his or her work, the interpretation of the 
results that he or she obtains in the lab, and‚Äîmost of all‚Äîthe impact that 
modern experimentation in organic chemistry might have on the future

n this lecture, you will explore what organic chemistry is, how it got 
started, and how our understanding of it has changed over the years. This 
lecture will scratch the surface of explaining how carbon‚Äôs abundance, 
bonding complexity, and bonding strength all combine to make it such a 
unique and versatile element for building complex small molecules. You will 
also learn how the decoration of these scaffolds with groups of other atoms 
can lead to a diverse library of useful compounds.

substances can be broken down into their basic elements, which can 
no longer be subdivided while still retaining their identity. 
‚Ä¢ 
Because carbon is central to the chemistry of life‚Äîand serves as 
the structural basis for materials of incredible strength, fuels with 
tremendous amounts of stored chemical energy, and life-saving 
medicines‚Äîwe have honored it with something no other element 
has: its own branch of chemistry, called organic chemistry.

based molecules. Compounds such as the hydrocarbons in gasoline, 
the sugars in the foods we eat, and many modern materials ranging 

5
from explosives to plastics are all built on carbon-based backbones 
and, therefore, fall into this category.
Why Carbon?
‚Ä¢ 
With over 100 elements in the modern periodic table, why does 
carbon get its own branch of chemistry? The answer to this question 
lies in a balance of three key factors: abundance, complexity, and 
VWDELOLW\:KHQZHFRPSDUHFDUERQWRRWKHUHOHPHQWVLQWKH¬øUVW
WKUHHURZVRIWKHSHULRGLFWDEOHZH¬øQGWKDWRQO\FDUERQLVDEOHWR
blend these three factors in a unique way.

elements in our solar system by mass, we would discover that many 
elements are so vanishingly rare that they do not even register on 
our chart. Hydrogen is the clear winner at about 73%, followed by 
helium at 24%, and then oxygen at about 1%. 
‚Ä¢ 
Out of more than 100 known elements, just this trio makes up 98% 
of all the matter in the solar system. But coming in at number four 
is carbon, making up about one-half of 1% of the matter in the solar 
V\VWHP%DVHGRQWKLVLQIRUPDWLRQDORQH\RXPLJKWH[SHFWWR¬øQG
subdisciplines of chemistry focusing on the chemistry of hydrogen, 
helium, or oxygen as well. However, these subdisciplines do  
not exist. 
‚Ä¢ 
These numbers are a bit different when we consider just the Earth, 
or even portions of it. The truth is that we aren‚Äôt quite sure just 
how much of each element makes up the overall mass of our 
planet. We do know, however, that as the planet cooled 4 billion 
years ago, denser elements like iron and nickel found their way to 
the core of the planet, and intermediate-sized elements like silicon 
and aluminum were sorted into the crust, leaving behind lighter 
elements like carbon in higher concentrations at the surface.
‚Ä¢ 
So, carbon is ever present near the surface of the Earth in the 
environments that might support life as we know it, but our best 
estimates of the amount of carbon in those environments‚Äîthe 

6
Lecture 1: Why Carbon?
world‚Äôs atmosphere, oceans, and 
crust‚Äîis never more than about 
1% of the total mass. This means 
that there is enough carbon there 
to work with, but if abundance 
were the only concern, then there 
would clearly be better choices.
‚Ä¢ 
However, when we turn our 
attention to our own bodies, we 
see that we are actually made up 
of about 20% carbon by mass. 
This is far more than the relative 
abundance of carbon in our environment‚Äîfar more than the oceans, 
the atmosphere, or dry land. So, carbon is available, but so are 
many other candidates. There is something about carbon that makes 
it a better choice for the structural basis of organic molecules. 
Contenders for the Role of Backbone Molecule 
‚Ä¢ 
All atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a 
cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electron clouds of two

between atoms a covalent chemical bond.
‚Ä¢ 
Remarkably, 19th-century Russian chemist Dmitry Mendeleev‚Äôs 
brainchild, known as the periodic table of the elements, accurately 
predicts the maximum number of these covalent bonding 
interactions that a particular atom can form with others. 
‚Ä¢ 
,IZHVWDUWIURPWKHOHIWRIWKHWDEOHHOHPHQWVRIWKH¬øUVWFROXPQ
can form one bond at most. Those of the second row can form two, 
and the trend continues until we reach the fourth row. After this, 
the maximum number of possible bonds begins to decrease again, 
to three, two, one, and then zero. This makes hydrogen a relatively 
uninteresting nucleus from the bonding perspective, because it can 
only form a single bond with another atom.
Carbon is ever present near the 
surface of the Earth.
¬ã6WRFNWUHN,PDJHV7KLQNVWRFN

7
‚Ä¢ 
So, hydrogen atoms are the end link in chains of bonded atoms. They 
can‚Äôt bond with any more atoms to continue creating a complex 
structure, because doing so would require that they make a second 
bond. That makes hydrogen the placeholder of organic chemistry, 
occupying locations on a molecule in which differing groups of 
atoms might be placed to alter that molecule‚Äôs identity and reactivity.
‚Ä¢ 
Helium (nature‚Äôs second most abundant element overall, but 
vanishingly rare on Earth) appears in group eight of the table, 
making it unlikely to form any bonds at all. Helium usually only 
exists naturally as isolated atoms that don‚Äôt commonly react with

doing so, oxygen can act either as a bridge, bonding to two different 
atoms perpetuating a chain, or as a terminal atom, making what is 
known as a double bond.
‚Ä¢ 
%XW RQFH R[\JHQ¬∂V WZR ERQGV DUH HVWDEOLVKHG LW LV VDWLV¬øHG DQG
there are no additional locations available to decorate or modify an 
oxygen chain. Using oxygen as a backbone atom would lead to a 
rather dull set of molecules‚Äîa set of ever-lengthening chains of 
oxygen atoms with no additional complexity.
‚Ä¢ 
But carbon interests organic chemists because it is found in group 
four of the table, meaning that it can, and often does, form four 
bonds to complete its octet‚Äîmore bonds than any other element in 
the second row of the periodic table. This allows carbon to bond to 
itself to form chains, branches, loops, and more.
‚Ä¢ 
Furthermore, these complex carbon scaffolds often have remaining 
XQVDWLV¬øHG ERQGV WKDW FDQ EH WHUPLQDWHG E\ K\GURJHQ DWRPV RU
decorated by bonding them to any number of other candidates. 
Clearly, those extra bonds that carbon can form will make all  
the difference.

‚Ä¢ 
Nitrogen and silicon are still on the list of possible backbone elements 
for larger, complex scaffolds. Nitrogen and silicon have withstood 
the test of both abundance and complexity, with nitrogen abundant in 
the atmosphere and able to form three bonds, while silicon makes up 
a large part of the Earth‚Äôs crust and is able to make four bonds.
‚Ä¢ 
What separates carbon from nitrogen and silicon is the last factor 
to consider: strength. Just like a building, organic molecules need 
a support structure tough enough to hold the functional parts of 
the compound in place. Any candidate for this role will have to 
be tough enough to withstand the conditions that cause other parts 
RIWKHFRPSRXQGWRUHDFW6RWKH¬øQDOIDFWRUOHDGLQJWRQDWXUH¬∂V
choice of carbon for small-molecule scaffolds is the stability of the 
carbon-carbon bond. 
‚Ä¢ 
%RQGLQJLVDQHQHUJHWLFDOO\EHQH¬øFLDODUUDQJHPHQWDQGDERQG¬∂V
strength is usually measured by the amount of energy required to 
separate the bonded atoms. Scientists call this the bond enthalpy. 
The larger the bond enthalpy, the harder it is to pull two bonded 
atoms apart, and the stronger the chemical bond should be.

,IZHFRPSDUHWKHERQGHQWKDOSLHVRIDOO¬øUVWVHFRQGDQGWKLUG
row elements to other atoms of the same kind, we can see that only 
hydrogen and boron form single bonds to other atoms of the same 
kind with the same strength as carbon. 
‚Ä¢ 
So, hydrogen does bond to itself strongly and is very abundant, but 
its one-bond limit rules it out. Boron can form stable bonds with 
itself in networks with up to three bonds, but it‚Äôs so vanishingly rare 
in the environment that it can‚Äôt play an important structural role in 
the chemistry of life. 
‚Ä¢ 
7KH ODVW WZR YLDEOH FDQGLGDWHV QLWURJHQ DQG VLOLFRQ DUH ¬øQDOO\
ruled out when we consider bond strength. With bonds only half 
as strong as carbon, nitrogen can‚Äôt compete, and even silicon, a 
favorite candidate as carbon‚Äôs alternate because of its abundance

because a covalent network of silicon atoms would simply not be 
stable enough to survive chemical reactions meant to modify other 
bonds within the molecules it would comprise.
‚Ä¢ 
6RLIZHFRQVLGHUWKH¬øUVWWKUHHURZVRIWKHSHULRGLFWDEOHUHPRYLQJ
elements of prohibitively low abundance, elements incapable of 
forming more than two bonds, and those that do not form strong 
single bonds to themselves, it now becomes obvious how these 
three factors make carbon uniquely suited to the formation of 
molecular scaffolds.
The Complexity of Carbon Scaffolds and Organic Molecules
‚Ä¢ 
Carbon atoms can combine to form distinct structures, and 
decorating these structures with other atoms can lead to a rich and 
diverse library of compounds. Part of what makes carbon scaffolds 
VRSUROL¬øFDQGGLYHUVHLVWKHPXOWLSOHZD\VLQZKLFKWKHIRXUERQGV
to carbon atoms can be arranged in space. 
‚Ä¢ 
Chemical bonds are formed when electron clouds overlap, and this 
produces a region of dense negative charge between the atoms‚Äô 
nuclei. These bonds, made up of negatively charged electrons, can be 
thought of as being negatively charged themselves. Because they are 
made up of like-charged particles, they repel one another, positioning 
themselves as far apart as possible around the central atom.
‚Ä¢ 
So, when a carbon atom is connected to two other atoms, either by 
two double bonds or a single and triple bond, the connected atoms 
are 180 degrees apart from one another, forming a linear geometry. 
When a carbon atom is connected to three other atoms‚Äîtwo atoms 
by single bonds and another atom by a double bond‚Äîthe atoms 
form a planar geometry in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 
with bond angles of 120 degrees. We call this type of geometry  
trigonal planar.
‚Ä¢ 
But the real magic happens when we use all four bonds to connect 
IRXUGLVWLQFWERQGLQJSDUWQHUV,QWKLVFDVHDSODQDUJHRPHWU\ZRXOG
require 90-degree angles. But giving these bonds access to the third 

11
dimension allows them to separate even more, forming bond angles 
of 109.5 degrees. We call this arrangement tetrahedral, because 
tracing lines among all bonded atoms produces a tetrahedron.
‚Ä¢ 
So, by bonding carbon atoms together using some or all of these 
geometries‚Äîlinear, trigonal planar, and, in particular, tetrahedral‚Äî
we can form almost any three-dimensional arrangement imaginable. 
Furthermore, there are remaining bonds terminated by hydrogen 
atoms that could be replaced by other sets of atoms, which means 
that each carbon scaffold can act as a backbone supporting hundreds, 
thousands, or even millions of distinct atom combinations.
‚Ä¢ 
By designing molecules in this way, chemists are able to create 
FRPSRXQGV ZLWK YHU\ VSHFL¬øF DQG UDWLRQDOO\ GHVLJQHG VKDSHV
physical properties, and reactivities. This quickly leads to a virtually 
limitless library of possible compounds, all of which rely on the 
stability and geometry of their carbon scaffold to function.

hemical bonds form the basis for not only organic chemistry, but 
also all of chemistry. Bonding is, in fact, much more than just a way 
to connect atoms to form larger molecules. Bonding has a way of 
changing atoms in ways that alter their physical properties and reactivity 
so profoundly that many materials of identical atomic composition have

The Structure of the Atom
‚Ä¢ 
Atoms are comprised of three types of subatomic particles: 
positively charged protons, uncharged neutrons, and negatively 
FKDUJHG HOHFWURQV 1LHOV %RKU LV IDPRXV IRU PDQ\ VFLHQWL¬øF
accomplishments but most notably for his model of the atom, in 
which a dense, positively charged core of protons and neutrons 
called the nucleus is orbited by a cloud of small, fast-moving, 
negatively charged electrons. Each of these three particles plays a 
role in the properties of any given atom.
‚Ä¢ 
Protons provide the atom with its identity. For example, a nucleus 
with six protons means carbon. Regardless of the number of other 
subatomic particles in the structure, a nucleus containing six 
protons is always carbon. 
‚Ä¢ 
Neutrons add mass to an atom but do not alter its identity. For 
example, a carbon atom may have six neutrons, as in carbon 12; 
seven neutrons, as in carbon 13; or eight neutrons, as in carbon 14. 
When atoms have the same number of protons‚Äîmeaning that they 
are the same element‚Äîbut have differing numbers of neutrons, thus 
giving them a different atomic mass, we refer to them as isotopes of 
one another.

‚Ä¢ 
Electrons most directly

atom to be neutral, it must 
have the same number 
of electrons and protons. 
When the number of 
electrons in the electron 
cloud is not equal to the 
number of protons in the 
nucleus, a charged species 
results. We call these 
charged species ions.

The Octet Rule
‚Ä¢ 
The free energy of a substance is simply a measure of its stability. 
,WWHOOVXVVRPHWKLQJDERXWKRZPXFKSRWHQWLDOWKHV\VWHPKDVWRGR
work. Just as physical processes trend toward lower energy states‚Äî
such as a ball rolling down a hill or heat transferring from a hot 
radiator into a cold room‚Äîit is the more stable states of matter that 
tend to form in chemical processes as well. 
‚Ä¢ 
This concept was developed by American chemist Willard Gibbs 
in the late 1800s. Gibbs modeled the free energy of a system as 
DIXQFWLRQRIWZRLPSRUWDQWIDFWRUV7KH¬øUVWRIWKHVHLVHQWKDOS\
which is simply energy contained within a system (H). The second 
term of the Gibbs free energy calculation is the temperature in 
kelvins multiplied by the entropy of the system (S). Entropy is 
RIWHQVLPSO\GH¬øQHGDVUDQGRPQHVVRUGLVRUGHU
‚Ä¢ 
The total Gibbs free energy of a system at a given temperature is 
equal to the enthalpy of the system minus the absolute temperature 
at which the process takes place multiplied by the entropy of 
the system. At a given temperature, the change in free energy

¬®G ¬®H√≠T¬®S.
‚Ä¢ 
When the Gibbs free energy change for a process is negative, we 
call the process spontaneous. Spontaneous processes are favored 
because the energy of the products is lower. A spontaneous reaction 
will eventually happen on its own, but it may not happen. 
‚Ä¢ 
Entropy (or disorder) is not on the side of chemical bonding, 
because bonds attach freely moving atoms into higher-order 
structures. So, the entropic penalty of bonding must be overcome 
somehow if we expect a bond to form at all.

distance from one another in space. Atoms are so small, and when 
bonded the distances between them are so short, that a special unit 
of distance, called an angstrom, is used to measure bond lengths. 
One angstrom is one ten-billionth of a meter.

,QWURGXFWRU\ FKHPLVWU\ FRXUVHV RIWHQ WHDFK WKDW WKHUH DUH WZR
kinds of bonds: ionic and covalent. But the truth is that there is a 
continuum of bonds, with ionic at one extreme and covalent at the 
other. These two modes of bonding are distinct, but both are driven 
by the same drive for atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

electronegativity come together. Simply put, electronegativity is a 
PHDVXUHRIKRZKXQJU\DQDWRPLVIRUHOHFWURQV,QJHQHUDOLIZH
neglect the noble gasses, electronegativity increases as we move 
from left to right on the periodic table because the nuclei of atoms 

17
are becoming increasingly positively charged. Electronegativity 
also increases from bottom to top because the electron clouds are 
becoming smaller, screening the nucleus from the outer electrons 
the least.
‚Ä¢ 
The alternative end of the bonding spectrum is the covalent bond. 
When we pair two atoms of very similar electronegativity, neither 
is particularly willing to exchange electrons with the other. But 
there is another solution to this problem: the sharing of electrons 
rather than the transfer of them, in which each atom is fooled into 
thinking that it has its own octet. This is the driving force behind  
covalent bonding.
‚Ä¢ 
But the complexity of electron sharing doesn‚Äôt stop there. There 
are also double bonds, in which two pairs of electrons are shared, 
and polar covalent bonds, which give water its high polarity among 
common solvents. 
Atomic Orbitals

WKH\UHVLGH,QRUGHUWRVKRZWKHVSHFL¬øFYROXPHRIVSDFHLQZKLFK
each electron resides within an energy level, we have to introduce a 
second level of organization: atomic orbitals. 
‚Ä¢ 
All energy levels contain a single s orbital. S orbitals are spherical in 
shape and increase in size with increasing principal energy level. The 
1s orbital is smaller than the 2s, which is again smaller than the 3s. 
‚Ä¢ 
Because each s orbital can only hold two electrons, the remaining 
VL[HOHFWURQVIURPWKHVHFRQGDQGWKLUGSULQFLSDOOHYHOPXVW¬øQG
another home. They do so in an array of three distinct p orbitals 
per level. Like s orbitals, p orbitals increase in size with increasing 
principal energy level. Unlike s orbitals, however, p orbitals are 
shaped like a dumbbell, with a node at the nucleus of the atom. All 
three p orbitals of any level are slightly higher in energy than the 
corresponding s orbital but are equal in energy to one another.

Lecture 2: Structure of the Atom and Chemical Bonding
Sigma and Pi Bonding
‚Ä¢ 
Two major classes of covalent bonds pervade the science of 
organic chemistry: sigma bonds and pi bonds. Sigma bonds form 
whenever orbitals overlap along the internuclear axis, such as two 
s atomic orbitals overlapping. Atoms with available p orbitals can 
also accomplish this type of bonding by overlapping one lobe of  
a p orbital.
‚Ä¢ 
Placing electron density directly between the two positively 
charged nuclei screens them from repelling one another, creating

however, create a bond around which the attached atoms can spin, 
like the axle of a vehicle, giving these bonds free rotation.
‚Ä¢ 
Pi bonds, on the other hand, form when p atomic orbitals overlap 
in a side-to-side fashion. There is no electron density along the 
internuclear axis, but rather above and below the bonded atoms. 
This makes pi bonds somewhat weaker than sigma bonds but also 
gives them some very interesting properties, such as restricted 
rotation‚Äîand, in many cases, greater reactivity, because their 
electrons are easier to remove. 
Orbital Hybridization
‚Ä¢ 
The elegant, simple symmetry of methane (CH4) was a puzzle to 
chemists until renowned physical chemist Linus Pauling published 
his theory on orbital hybridization in 1931. Pauling postulated that 
atomic orbitals could combine with one another, creating new sets 
of orbitals with some s character and some p character‚Äîwhich he 
referred to as hybrid orbitals.
‚Ä¢ 
Remarkably, Pauling‚Äôs theory was spot on, and methane‚Äîthe 
simplest of all organic molecules‚Äîwas all the evidence he needed.

investigate the challenge of providing a reader with the right structural 
information about molecules. You will learn about the techniques that are 
widely used to help researchers communicate effectively, predicting and 
explaining the properties of new compounds.
Communicating the Identity of the Atoms
‚Ä¢ 
We often model molecules as connected spheres, in which atoms 
are represented by the spheres and the sticks tell us where bonds 
connect these atoms. These models are called ball-and-stick 
models. By far the most popular color choices for these cartoonlike 
representations of atoms are those pioneered by Robert Corey, 
Linus Pauling, and Walter Koltun‚Äîcalled the CPK color scheme.
‚Ä¢ 
The problem, of course, is that building models isn‚Äôt always 
practical. We often need to quickly depict the structure of a molecule 
using little more than a pen and paper or a two-dimensional 
computer screen. When chemists endeavor to draw molecules for 
one another, they must convey three critical types of information: 
the identity of the atoms, the connectivity of those atoms, and the 
geometry of the molecule. 
‚Ä¢ 
The empirical formula of a compound gives us the identity and 
ratio of each element in the compound. For example, a molecule 
containing two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms called 
ethene has an empirical formula of CH2, because the ratio of its 
two constituent elements is one to two. Of course, many different 
compounds may have the empirical formula CH2, including a 
molecule known as butylethylene.

21
‚Ä¢ 
But the empirical formula is limited in its ability to distinguish 
among compounds of similar composition. Unlike the empirical 
formula, a molecular formula gives us the exact number of each 
type of atom in the compound (rather than its simplest whole-
number ratio). Using its molecular formula, we would describe 
ethene as C2H4 and butylethylene as C6H12.
Communicating the Connectivity of the Atoms
‚Ä¢ 
,PDJLQHDVLWXDWLRQLQZKLFKPROHFXODUIRUPXODVPLJKWEHWKHVDPH
for two different compounds. Although the molecular formula 
solves the ambiguity between ethene and butylethylene, consider 
comparing butylethylene to a similar yet distinct chemical cousin: 
tetramethylethylene. Both will have the molecular formula C6H12, 
but the atoms are connected differently. 
‚Ä¢ 
This is where the second parameter‚Äîconnectivity‚Äîbecomes 
important. Each compound consists of 6 carbon atoms and 12 
hydrogen atoms, but the double bond is in a different location 
between the two. 
‚Ä¢ 
Hydrogen is the placeholder of organic chemistry, meaning that it 
can be substituted with other atoms or groups. So, when we have a 
different or more complex group in a place that would otherwise be 
bonded to a hydrogen, we call these groups substituents.

to a condensed structural formula, in which each carbon, its 
hydrogens, and its substituents are written as an individual formula 
in a series. For example, butylethylene would be represented as 
CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3, while tetramethylethylene would be 
represented as (CH3)2CC(CH3)2.

on the part of the viewer to thoroughly understand it.

that of chemistry, chemists in fact have devised similar schemes to 
project three-dimensional objects of interest onto two-dimensional 
surfaces. The only difference is that we are not concerned with 
globes but molecules.

23
‚Ä¢ 
The most commonly employed ways in which we try to show the 
relative positions of atoms, particularly at the introductory level, are 
by perspective formulas, Newman projections, Fischer projections,

When you do this, you are forced to place all but two of the hydrogen

The method that is used to convey the location of the remaining 
atoms is to draw their bonds differently depending on whether they 
are within the plane of the page, coming forward out of the page, or 
falling behind the plane of the page.

atoms closer to the viewer, and a dashed wedge is used for those 
that would be farther away.
Fischer Projections

the arrangements of atoms in small molecules, they can become

Emil Fischer was dealing with just such a problem when he was 
researching carbohydrates, which commonly consist of carbon 
chains numbering anywhere from three to six atoms in length and 
can be even longer. 

24

With so many atoms in the chain, perspective drawings can

molecule is projected with the chain oriented up and down on the 
page in such a way that the chain itself is falling behind the page.
‚Ä¢ 
When this is done, the two groups not in the chain have bonds that 
appear horizontal but are located above the page. So, projecting this 
arrangement onto a two-dimensional surface casts a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù of 
the molecule, in which all vertical bonds are pointing behind the 
page and all horizontal bonds are pointing above the page.
Newman Projections
‚Ä¢ 
The third method of projection we owe to Melvin Spencer Newman, 
who was an American organic chemist working at Ohio State 
University in the middle of the 20th century. Newman is famous for 
KLV SUROL¬øF FDUHHU V\QWKHVL]LQJ DQG FKDUDFWHUL]LQJ K\GURFDUERQV

also the rotational state of the bonds in a molecule can affect its 
reactivity. Certain reactions require that substituents on adjacent 
DWRPV EH DOLJQHG LQ FHUWDLQ ZD\V :H GH¬øQH WKLV VRUW RI DQJOH
between substituent bonds on adjacent carbons as dihedral angles. 
As the carbon-carbon bond rotates, these dihedral angles change. 
Chemists call these different states of the same molecule differing 
only by the dihedral angles of their substituents ‚Äúrotamers.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
Newman‚Äôs problem was that while perspective formulas and 
Fischer projections are both effective methods of communicating 
the arrangement of atoms about tetrahedral centers, neither is

dihedral bond angle. 

25
‚Ä¢ 
To view dihedral angles better, in Newman projections, the closer 
(or proximal) atom is drawn as a circle, and its bonded substituents 
are depicted with lines going all the way to the center. The farther 
(or distal) atom is obscured by the closer (or proximal) atom, and 
the other three bonded substituents are depicted with lines that end 
at the perimeter of the proximal atom, as though they are behind it. 
The other three groups bonded to the proximal atom are connected

accurately shown on paper. 
Stereoimages
‚Ä¢ 
One of the great fads of the 1990s was what we popularly refer 
to as ‚Äúmagic eye‚Äù posters, which have a hidden three-dimensional 
image buried within a seemingly simple pattern. The trick to seeing 
the three-dimensional image is to focus your eyes on a point far 
beyond the picture in the distance. When this is done with the 
viewer standing at the requisite distance, a three-dimensional image 
appears to leap off of the page.
Stereoimages are helpful in visualizing three-dimensional models on two-
dimensional surfaces.

This neat trick used to create novelties to hang on your wall can 
also be used to place any three-dimensional drawing on a two-
dimensional page. Magic eye posters work because what appears to 
be only one complex pattern in fact contains two adjacent patterns: 
one intended for your left eye and the other for your right. Focusing 
on a distant point causes your eyes to see separate images that 
convey slightly different perspectives, simulating a phenomenon 
called parallax. When your left eye and your right eye see slightly 
different images, your brain combines these images and interprets 
the differences to create depth.

molecule and then a second image just slightly rotated, producing 
the two images your brain would use to help you perceive depth. 
Placing these images side by side at just the right distance creates 
an image akin to the magic eye posters.

Drawing Chemical Reactions
Lecture 4
A
s useful as it is to have representations showing compounds in their 
most stable, ideal states, chemists are ultimately concerned with a 
material‚Äôs physical and chemical properties in the real world, where 
bonds vibrate and electrons move through clouds around those bonds. These 
physical and chemical changes are best communicated not by a single ideal

lecture, you will learn how to create drawings that depict the transfer of 
electrons from one location to another, resulting in the formation, alteration, 
or breaking of connections between atoms.
Depicting Resonance
‚Ä¢ 
Electrons within a molecule‚Äôs electron cloud are always in motion, 
and pi bonds have a unique ability to form and break without 
altering the connectivity of atoms, because their stronger sigma 
bonds can remain intact while the weaker pi bonds are broken.
‚Ä¢ 
So, electron pairs that are not involved in bonding at all‚Äî
sometimes called lone-pair electrons‚Äîand pi-bonding electrons 
can be more mobile within a molecule‚Äôs overall electron cloud and

by a hybrid orbital or an isolated pi bond. They can traverse great 
distances across molecules using p ortbitals without disrupting the 
connectivity of the atoms. 
‚Ä¢ 
These long, interconnected systems of p orbitals are sometimes 
called pi systems. So, as electrons move through these pi systems, 
no reaction is taking place, but our method of drawing an individual 
structure begins to fail.
‚Ä¢ 
The phenomenon of electrons moving about a molecule is called 
resonance, and each drawing of the molecule is called a resonance

can draw, the more free electrons are to move around within a 
molecule‚Äôs electron cloud. This freedom of electron motion tends to 
stabilize compounds. 
‚Ä¢ 
To show resonance, we place brackets around all contributing 
structures, and we use straight, double-headed arrows to separate 
each contributor. These are your cues to create the best possible 
approximation of the molecule‚Äôs structure by mentally combining 
all of the resonance contributors into a weighted-average structure 
called the resonance hybrid, which will give you the best 
approximation of the structure if you want to predict the reactivity 
or properties of it. Contributors with less charge separation tend to 
be a closer representation of the hybrid than their charge-containing 
counterparts.
Depicting Change with Time
‚Ä¢ 
Creating a static depiction of a system that is changing through time 
can be a challenging undertaking, but it is one that humanity has 
deemed worthy since prehistory. For example, the cave painters of 
Paleolithic Europe and Africa tried to document their hunts with 
just a few simple markings. 
‚Ä¢ 
Similarly, modern-day comic strip artists tell a story using a 
storyboard of static images depicting different moments in the 
QDUUDWLYH,WLVXSWRWKHUHDGHUVWRFRPELQHWKHVHLPDJHVLQWKHLU
minds to create a seamless, running story. 
‚Ä¢ 
Organic chemistry is no different. Someone might show you the 
chemical structures of ammonium cyanate and urea, but unless that 
person gives greater detail, it is up to you to decide how you think 
the transition took place using your understanding of how organic 
chemistry works.
‚Ä¢ 
Of course, technology has progressed to the point at which we often 
do not have to perform this exercise anymore. Computer animation

But even with the advantages of modern technology, fully

out most ambiguities, but it requires a great deal of effort to create 
and also special devices to view. For the purposes of day-to-day 
communication, chemists prefer to use a faster, shorthand style of 
depicting reactions that has developed over the centuries.
Reaction Schemes
‚Ä¢ 
The simplest possible illustration of a chemical change is a reaction 
scheme. Chemists often do not know or feel the need to convey 
minute mechanistic details of a chemical reaction as it takes place. 
Sometimes their argument simply depends on what was present at 
the beginning of the reaction and what is present at the end.
‚Ä¢ 
:KHQ WKLV UXGLPHQWDU\ OHYHO RI GHWDLO LV VXI¬øFLHQW ZH RIWHQ XVH
reaction schemes to show the four most crucial details of any 
chemical reaction: starting materials, products, conditions, and 
reversibility. We always write reactions from left to right when 
possible, indicating reagents on the left and products on the right. 
‚Ä¢ 
We separate these two groups of materials with an arrow or arrows 
that tell us something about the reversibility of the reaction, and 
above these arrows is a notation of special conditions, catalysts, or 
other crucial information about the reaction.
Reaction Mechanisms
‚Ä¢ 
So far, the drawing examples we have learned about have been 
limited in the sense that they convey a great deal about what we 
start and end with but relatively little about what goes on in the 
interim. Because reaction schemes only show a list of starting 
materials and products, we are left to wonder exactly how those 
starting materials go about becoming products. One might make the 
analogy that it is like having a pile of boards, screws, and other 
pieces and a picture of the table they make when assembled, but the 
step-by-step manual is missing.

30
Lecture 4: Drawing Chemical Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
When organic chemists want to convey the process of conversion in 
more detail, they turn to a style of drawing known as a mechanism. 
A mechanism, just like that manual for assembling our table, is 
a series of elementary steps, each not only showing the starting 
material, reversibility conditions, and products, but also explicitly 
showing how electrons from each species are exchanged to make 
and break bonds.
‚Ä¢ 
By drawing a mechanism, we increase the amount of information 
in our illustration by including the intermediates in our drawing. 
¬≥,QWHUPHGLDWH¬¥LVDWHUPXVHGE\FKHPLVWVWRGHVFULEHWKRVHVSHFLHV
that form transiently during a reaction but quickly go on to react 
again to complete the process.
‚Ä¢ 
But far from simply showing these punctuated states throughout 
the reaction, we want to demonstrate how each interconverts. This 
PHDQVGHSLFWLQJWKH√ÄRZRIHOHFWURQVWKDWPDNHVDQGEUHDNVERQGV
during each step. We accomplish this using curved arrows. When 
two electrons are involved, we use a full head on the arrow, and 
when just one electron is moving, we use a half-headed arrow. 
Energy Diagrams
‚Ä¢ 
So, we are now acquainted with the techniques used not only to 
draw molecular structures, but also in the elements of drawing used 
to convey elementary steps and the electron transitions that take 
place in each one. But there is one more piece of information that is 
crucial to understanding how these transitions occur: the chemical 
energetics of the process. 
‚Ä¢ 
Just like in classical physics, chemists think in terms of potential 
energy. Just as a physical object, like a ball, is expected to roll down 
a hill, thereby decreasing its potential physical energy and reaching 
a more stable state, so will a molecular system react in a way that 
decreases its overall potential chemical energy, also making it more 
stable. The difference is that chemical energy is a bit less intuitive 
to determine.

31
‚Ä¢ 
Still, to fully understand the process of a chemical reaction, we 
need a quick and convenient method for demonstrating whether a 
particular transition increases or decreases the overall chemical free 
energy of the system and by how much. 
‚Ä¢ 
To better understand this concept, consider the simple example of a 
ball perched just behind a hilltop. Classical physics tells us that the 
potential energy of that ball in its current position is higher than that 
of the same ball at the bottom of the hill. When given a small push 
to overcome the barrier, the ball will spontaneously roll downward, 
presumably coming to rest at the bottom in the lowest energy  
state available. 
‚Ä¢ 
Chemical systems are a perfect analogy for the physical system 
that was just described. Just as the ball has an associated physical 
potential energy that it would like to release, a collection of 
molecules will have an associated chemical free energy in their 
initial state. When a small energetic barrier is overcome by the 
addition of heat, catalysts, or other perturbations, the system can 
then convert spontaneously to its lower energy state. 
Just as a ball has an associated physical potential energy that it would like to 
release, a collection of molecules will have an associated chemical free energy 
in their initial state.

Chemists often convey this energetic landscape of a chemical 
reaction mechanism using this hill analogy in what is known as a 
reaction coordinate diagram‚Äîthe only difference being that the 
‚Äúhill‚Äù is one of chemical potential energy rather than one of physical 
potential energy. So, these diagrams are essentially plots of system 
free energy as a function of reaction progress.

t may seem daunting to consider the sheer number of possible molecular 
structures and how they might all interact with one another. But many 
reactions follow similar pathways and generally obey similar rules, so 
chemists group reactions into just a few fundamental classes. Probably the

as proton acceptors. Lewis acids are those species that can easily 
accept an electron pair to form a new bond, while Lewis bases 
donate electron pairs to bonds. 
Proton Transfer
‚Ä¢ 
Proton-transfer reactions are usually very fast, reaching equilibrium 
long before other reactions can occur. There are, of course, 
exceptions to this rule, but in general, we can expect that a system 
will reach its most stable protonation state long before any other 
reactions can occur.
‚Ä¢ 
The proton-transfer reaction is an equilibrium‚Äîa state of dynamic

cases, just a small amount of products coexists with reagents at

consisting of nearly all products and just a small amount of 
reactants. The extent to which this equilibrium lies in favor of 
products or reactants is dependent on the strengths of the acids 
appearing in the equation.
‚Ä¢ 
The strength of an acid‚Äîfor example, a hypothetical compound 
HA‚Äîcan be thought of simply as how easily that acid loses its 
acidic proton. Upon loss of a proton, an acidic molecule becomes a 
base. We call such a pair of species (differing by only one hydrogen 
and one unit of charge) conjugate acids and bases, and we call this 
reaction an acid dissociation. So, in our simple acid dissociation,

35
‚Ä¢ 
The strength of acid HA can be modeled mathematically as an 
equilibrium process, which produces an equilibrium constant 
expression of conjugate base concentration multiplied by proton 
concentration divided by conjugate acid concentration. For any 
given acid, this expression will always produce the same number at 
equilibrium. We label this value Ka for the acid in question.
‚Ä¢ 
Because Ka values can be extremely large or small, spanning dozens 
of orders of magnitude, we often report these values as pKa, or the 
negative log of the Ka value. Using this system, a Ka of 0.1 becomes 
a pKa of 1, a Ka of 0.01 becomes a pKa of 2, a Ka of 0.001 becomes 
a pKaRIDQGVRRQ,QJHQHUDOSKa values are a valuable means of 
quickly comparing acid strengths.

Lecture 5: Acid‚ÄìBase Chemistry
Factors Affecting Strengths of Acids and Bases
‚Ä¢ 
Careful consideration of a compound‚Äôs structure allows us to 
estimate its acidity or make an assertion about the relative acidities 
of two compounds, though not necessarily to predict their exact pKa 
values. Because the loss of a proton by an acid always produces its 
conjugate base, one way to predict acidity is to simply assess the 
stability of the conjugate base that forms. A more stable conjugate 
base means a stronger acid with a higher Ka and a lower pKa.
‚Ä¢ 
,Q JHQHUDO WZR IDFWRUV FRPELQH WR DIIHFW WKH VWDELOLW\ RI VXFK
conjugate bases. First is the electronegativity of nearby atoms 
causing electrons to be pulled away from the site at which the 
proton would be held. 
‚Ä¢ 
Second is nearby pi systems providing the stabilizing effect of 
resonance. Both of these factors affect stability essentially the same 
way‚Äîby spreading and delocalizing the charges that can form 
when proton removal occurs. 
‚Ä¢ 
These trends offer chemists a quick way to estimate relative 
acidities of compounds‚Äîa property that can be critical in synthesis, 
SXUL¬øFDWLRQDQGLGHQWL¬øFDWLRQ
Polyprotic Acids
‚Ä¢ 
Monoprotic acids have just one acidic hydrogen because their other 
hydrogens are bonded strongly and directly to the carbon scaffold, 
so their acid‚Äìbase chemistry is limited to a simple two-state system 
in which the molecule is either protonated or deprotonated. We 
call these types of acids ‚Äúmonoprotic‚Äù because they have just one 
acidic hydrogen that can be removed under all but the most extreme 
conditions.
‚Ä¢ 
This makes acid‚Äìbase equilibria involving monoprotic acids 
very easy to model, because there are only two potential states: 
protonated or deprotonated.

37
‚Ä¢ 
When an acid can‚Äîand sometimes actually does‚Äîlose two or 
even three protons in an acid‚Äìbase reaction, we refer to it as a 
‚Äúpolyprotic‚Äù acid, because it has multiple acidic hydrogens. The 
conjugate bases that still contain acidic hydrogens have the very 
interesting property of being able to act either as an acid, losing a 
proton, or as a base, accepting a proton. We call these species that 
can act as acids or bases ‚Äúamphoteric.‚Äù
Tautomers
‚Ä¢ 
There is a special type of proton transfer called tautomerization. 
During this process, a proton is transferred within the molecule 
itself. This can take place as a completely intramolecular process, 
or with a bit of assistance from a base to transport it.
‚Ä¢ 
For a proton transfer to be considered tautomerization, a proton 
must be relocated without disturbing the connectivity of the other 
atoms in the molecule. 
‚Ä¢ 
One example of this is called a keto‚Äìenol tautomerization, in which 
a double-bonded oxygen accepts a proton while a nearby carbon 
ORVHV D SURWRQ ,Q WKLV FDVH WKH UHVXOWLQJ FKDUJH VHSDUDWLRQ LV
UHFWL¬øHGE\UHORFDWLQJDGRXEOHERQG%HFDXVHWKHDWRPFRQQHFWLYLW\
is not disturbed, this is a true tautomerization.
Zwitterions
‚Ä¢ 
A second type of intramolecular proton transfer takes place in amino 
acids like glycine, which contains an acidic site and a basic site on 
the same molecule. Just as in the case of tautomers, the acidic site 
loses a proton while the basic site accepts it. 
‚Ä¢ 
The distinction is that a zwitterion cannot neutralize the resulting 
charges by resonance. Glycine, just like all other amino acids, 
has an sp3 carbon between the two sites, which prohibits us from 
drawing any resonance structures that redistribute charges.

Stereochemistry‚ÄîMolecular Handedness

you will learn how tetrahedral centers in molecules can be chiral and how 
handedness can be inverted. You will also be introduced to some examples 
of stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers. You will 
explore how it is possible for compounds to have stereoisomers even when 
they do not have chiral centers. Finally, you will learn about a system for 
ranking substituents around stereocenters and about how chiral centers are 
categorized. 
Handedness
‚Ä¢ 
Carbon atoms can have up to four sigma bonds, meaning four 
different bonded substituents arranged tetrahedrally about the 
central atom. When these four substituents are all distinct from one 
another, there are two different possible arrangements that have the 
same connectivity.
Like stereoisomers, human hands are non-superimposable mirror images of one 
another.

you make an exact copy of the structure and then interchange the 
location of two substituents, the resulting structure has all of the 
same connectivity but cannot be superimposed with the original by 
translation or rotation. 
‚Ä¢ 
These two hypothetical molecules have handedness. For example, 
WKHGLUHFWLRQRIWKHWKXPESDOPDQG¬øQJHUVDUHDOOXQLTXHWRD

right hands, you cannot make all of those objects superimpose 
simultaneously.
‚Ä¢ 
When interchanging two substituents on a central atom produces 
a new molecule, that central atom is called a stereocenter. A 
tetrahedral carbon is this tetrahedral center with four distinct 
substituents, which chemists call chiral centers. The result is 
nonsuperimposable objects with identical connectivity, which 
chemists call stereoisomers.
Enantiomers, Diastereomers, and Meso Compounds
‚Ä¢ 
Pairs of stereoisomers fall into several distinct categories, and 
understanding each of them is critical to understanding the physical 
DQG FKHPLFDO SURSHUWLHV RI VRPH RUJDQLF FRPSRXQGV 7KH ¬øUVW
class of stereoisomers is enantiomers. These can be thought of as 
nonsuperimposable mirror images or as a pair of compounds in 
which all of the stereocenters are inverted.

,Q WKH VLPSOHVW H[DPSOH RI D WHWUDKHGUDO FHQWHU ZLWK MXVW RQH
stereocenter, this is the only possible relationship that we can 
develop (because you can‚Äôt invert a fraction of a stereocenter).
‚Ä¢ 
When more than one chiral (or ‚Äúhandedness‚Äù) center is present 
in a molecule, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Take 
the example of a compound with two nonidentical stereocenters. 
,QYHUVLRQRIERWKVWHUHRFHQWHUVSURGXFHVDPLUURULPDJHWKDWFDQQRW
be superimposed with the original. A set of enantiomers can be 

41
made. Recall that enantiomers are compounds in which all chiral 
centers have been inverted.
‚Ä¢ 
But now that we have multiple centers, it is possible to invert only 
one chiral center while leaving the other in its original state. When 
we do this, the result is a compound with identical connectivity 
that is neither superimposable nor a mirror image. Such pairs of 
compounds are called diastereomers. 
‚Ä¢ 
Sets of diastereomers are distinct from sets of enantiomers in that 
they can, and often do, have different physical properties, such as 
boiling and melting points.
‚Ä¢ 
A third and somewhat unusual situation arises when a compound 
contains two stereocenters with the same four substituents attached 
WRHDFK,QWKLVLQVWDQFHLWLVSRVVLEOHWRKDYHDVLWXDWLRQLQZKLFKD
complete inversion of stereochemistry leads to a mirror image that 
is still superimposable with the original. We call compounds like 
this meso compounds.
Achiral Stereoisomers
‚Ä¢ 
Not all stereoisomers contain chiral centers. Recall that the 
GH¬øQLWLRQ RI ¬≥VWHUHRFHQWHU¬¥ LV WKDW LQWHUFKDQJLQJ WZR JURXSV RQ
the center changes the identity of a molecule. Recall also that pi 
bonds have restricted rotation, owing to the side-to-side overlap of 
p atomic orbitals that cannot be interrupted unless we break the pi 
bond. Because we cannot rotate pi bonds, it is possible to have a 
compound that has multiple stereocenters, even though there are no 
tetrahedral atoms in the stereocenter.
‚Ä¢ 
A simple example of this is the molecule commonly called beta-
butylene. At a glance, beta-butylene seems simple enough, but each 
carbon in the pi bond has two other distinct substituents bonded to 
it. Combined with the fact that the pi bond restricts rotation, there 
are actually two different isomers: one with the larger CH3 groups 
at opposition and the other with the larger CH3 groups on the same 
side of the molecule.

42
Lecture 6: Stereochemistry‚ÄîMolecular Handedness
‚Ä¢ 
The presence of the pi bond makes these two isomers distinct from 
one another, because breaking the pi bond between the intervening 
carbons would be necessary in order to achieve the kind of rotation 
necessary to make them superimposable. This sort of thing 
doesn‚Äôt tend to happen on its own; it takes a very special set of 
circumstances to encourage such a change.
The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Convention

reactions involving alkanes, including combustion in oxygen and free-radical 
halogenation, and to the phenomenon of hyperconjugation, which helps 
explain why radical halogenations tend to occur best at more-substituted 
carbons.
Introduction to Alkanes
‚Ä¢ 
Hydrocarbons are historically and commercially important 
compounds. Alkanes are the simplest class of hydrocarbons. 
The term ‚Äúalkane‚Äù refers to any hydrocarbon in which all of the 
carbon atoms are sp3 hybridized, meaning that there are no pi  
bonds present. 
Hydrocarbons are historically and commercially important compounds, 
providing power, heat, and light.
¬ã9LNWRU&DSL6WRFN7KLQNVWRFN

47
‚Ä¢ 
Because all of the carbons in an alkane must have four bonds, the 
empirical formula of alkanes is always CnH2n+2. The smallest three 
alkanes possible are methane, ethane, and propane. We can continue 
adding carbons to our chains to create the familiar stove and lighter 
fuel, butane. 
Branched Alkanes and Structural Isomerism
‚Ä¢ 
One can imagine how dull the science of hydrocarbons might 
be if only one type of hydrocarbon existed for each number 
of carbons. Limiting ourselves to an ever-lengthening straight 
chain of carbon only provides one distinct hydrocarbon for each  
molecular formula. 
‚Ä¢ 
Fortunately, this is only the case for three of them: methane, ethane, 
and propane. When we reach four carbons, new connectivities 
become possible, and the number of possibilities quickly grows as 
we add more.
‚Ä¢ 
The addition of the fourth carbon atom leads to a situation in which 
more than one structural arrangement of atoms is possible‚Äîwhat 
chemists call structural isomerism. For example, the carbons of 
butane can form a straight chain, but a second possible arrangement 
is possible in which the fourth carbon atom is branched off from 
a chain of three. Each of these molecules is a hydrocarbon of the 
formula C4H10, yet they are different chemical entities because of 
the difference in bond connectivity. 
‚Ä¢ 
But these two isomers of butane only scratch the surface of a 
vast library of alkanes, because each additional carbon atom 
exponentially increases the number of possibilities. There are 
2 structural isomers of butane, 3 isomers of pentane, 5 isomers

double that carbon count to just 16, a staggering 10,359 structural

Physical Properties of Alkanes
‚Ä¢ 
Alkanes do not have polar bonds that can affect the attractive forces 
between them. They have only their electron clouds, which are 
soft and polarizable. This means that as electrons move about the 
molecule‚Äôs electron cloud, an intermittent charge buildup, or dipole, 
can form in one molecule and induce a second intermittent dipole in 
a neighboring molecule, provided that they are close enough.
‚Ä¢ 
These two dipoles cause compounds to attract one another slightly, 
resulting in higher boiling points and increased viscosities. We call 
this type of attractive force London dispersion forces.
‚Ä¢ 
One can imagine that longer alkanes with larger electron clouds 
can produce stronger London dispersion forces than their shorter 
counterparts. This is clearly manifested in the phase behavior of 
hydrocarbons. Smaller chains making up methane, ethane, propane, 
and butane are easily recognized as gasses at typical pressures 
and temperatures, at which pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane  
are liquids. 
‚Ä¢ 
Chemists use the term ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù to describe the tendency of 
a compound to vaporize. So, we would say that methane is more 
volatile than pentane or that octane is less volatile than propane. 
This term should not be confused with the more colloquial meaning 
of volatility, which is taken to mean unstable, unpredictable,  
or explosive.
‚Ä¢ 
But the trend in volatility does not stop there. The boiling points 
of each hydrocarbon just mentioned systematically increase as 
chains lengthen and dispersion forces increase attraction among  
similar molecules.
‚Ä¢ 
Branching also has a predictable effect on physical properties. As 
hydrocarbons of the same mass become increasingly branched,

Lecture 7: Alkanes‚ÄîThe Simplest Hydrocarbons
Chemical Properties of Alkanes
‚Ä¢ 
Alkanes are not terribly reactive from the organic chemistry 
standpoint. Their lack of polarity leads to structures that do not tend 
to participate in most reactions, but it does give them the ability to 
dissolve a wide array of more reactive compounds. For this reason, 
liquid-phase alkanes are commonly used in organic chemistry labs 
as solvents. 
‚Ä¢ 
Among the reactions that can be undertaken with alkanes is 
combustion with oxygen, which leads to a mixture of carbon 
dioxide and hydrogen in an irreversible process. This is one of the 
processes that we rely on 
to power engines, provide 
heat, and give us light.
‚Ä¢ 
But chemists rely on 
combustion 
for 
yet 
another 
purpose. 
We 
can use it as a means for 
comparing the stability 
of similar compounds. 
This type of experiment 
is called calorimetry. 
‚Ä¢ 
A calorimeter is a sealed 
system that is charged 
with a known amount 
of a given compound 
DQG HQRXJK R[\JHQ WR FRPSOHWHO\ FRPEXVW LW ,I WKH FRPEXVWHG
materials produce the same products (in the case of hydrocarbons, 
this would be carbon dioxide and water), then any difference in 
the heat released must be a result of differences in the stability of 
the starting material. More heat released means that a less stable 
compound was combusted.
Combustion of hydrocarbons is a 
process we rely on to power our 
engines.

51
Radical Halogenation
‚Ä¢ 
With such a large supply of varied hydrocarbons available, they 
make an attractive entry point to organic synthesis for many 
different carbon scaffolds. Despite their relatively low reactivity, 
alkanes are frequently used for this purpose in labs and chemical 
plants around the world.
‚Ä¢ 
One of the most important uses from a synthetic organic chemistry 
standpoint is as a starting material used in the synthesis of a set 
of compounds called alkyl halides. Because carbon-carbon and 
carbon-hydrogen bonds are so stable, we have to use an unusual 
trick to get them to react. We have to present them with a highly 
UHDFWLYH DWRP RI D KDORJHQ VXFK DV √ÄXRULQH FKORULQH LRGLQH 
or bromine. 
‚Ä¢ 
The mechanism for this reaction begins with activation of a halogen 
PROHFXOH E\ D SKRWRQ RI D YHU\ VSHFL¬øF ZDYHOHQJWK XVXDOO\ LQ
the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. We usually represent light 
activation with the characters hn, which are actually variables 
representing Planck‚Äôs constant and frequency. When multiplied 
together, these terms yield the amount of energy carried by a photon 
of a given type of light.
‚Ä¢ 
When a halogen molecule like chlorine absorbs this photon, 
the bond between the two halogen atoms breaks, sending one 
bonding electron to each atom. We call this sort of bond breaking 
‚Äúhomolytic‚Äù because the bond breaks symmetrically. This is called 
the initiation step of the reaction.
‚Ä¢ 
The result of this process is two halogen atoms, each of which 
contains an unpaired electron. We call species with unpaired

their octet.

52
Lecture 7: Alkanes‚ÄîThe Simplest Hydrocarbons
‚Ä¢ 
One chlorine radical accomplishes this by removing a hydrogen 
from the alkyl halide, generating an alkyl radical. So, now our alkyl

radical but generates a new chlorine radical that can react similarly 
with another alkane.
‚Ä¢ 
This phase of the reaction is known as propagation. During 
propagation, new product is forming, but new chlorine radicals are 
also forming, carrying on in a chain reaction.
‚Ä¢ 
Finally, the chain reaction terminates when two alkyl radicals react 
in a homogenic bond formation. Just as homolytic bond breaking 
sends two bonding electrons in separate ways, homogenic bond 
formation takes place when a new bond forms from two electrons, 
one from each bonding partner.
‚Ä¢ 
At the end of this reaction, we have reacted an alkane and chlorine 
by a photoactivated reaction to form hydrochloric acid, an alkyl 
halide, and a small amount of the termination product. This is a 
very distinctive reaction‚Äînot only because it is a photoactivated 
radical reaction, but also because it is a chain reaction. We turn to 
this technique to modify alkanes because their remarkable stability 
requires such extreme measures.
Hyperconjugation
‚Ä¢ 
What happens when there are multiple carbons in the hydrocarbon 
starting material? The answer is that the halogenation will occur 
preferentially at the most substituted carbon possible. The exception 
to this is quaternary carbons, because they do not have a bonded 
hydrogen, which is required for the reaction to take place. 
‚Ä¢ 
For example, propane has primary and secondary carbons, and even 
though it is outnumbered two to one, it is the secondary carbon that 
will get the chlorine atom in greatest abundance and, therefore, will 
be the major product.

53
‚Ä¢ 
To understand why this happens, we need to invoke a phenomenon 
called hyperconjugation. Any time a p atomic orbital makes 
an appearance adjacent to an sp3 bonding orbital, there can be 
an alignment that allows electrons to be intermittently shared 
EHWZHHQWKHWZR,QWKHFDVHRIDUDGLFDOWKHUHLVRQO\RQHHOHFWURQ
in the nonbonding p orbital, but placing a methyl group next to 
it means that there will be a bonding orbital that can align with 
it, sharing just a small amount of its electron density with its  
HOHFWURQGH¬øFLHQWQHLJKERU
‚Ä¢ 
Distribution of electrons tends to lead to stability, so when we 
compare the two possible radicals that can form from propane 
in this process, we see that a primary radical can form in which 
one stabilizing hyperconjugation is present, but in the secondary 
radical, there are two of these interactions.
‚Ä¢ 
Because it is more stable, the secondary radical is expected to form

the phenomenon of ring strain. Finally, you will be introduced to a few 
bicyclic hydrocarbons. 
Cyclic Alkanes
‚Ä¢ 
The connectivity of carbon atoms in hydrocarbons leads to millions 
of possible geometric isomers, including cyclic chains. Because 
carbon can bond so well to itself, a chain of atoms frequently turns 
back on itself and create a cyclic chain. We see such cyclic chains 
in a variety of organic compounds, from medicines to explosives. 
‚Ä¢ 
The simplest possible cyclic hydrocarbon, one with three carbon 
atoms, has found uses as a starting material for many organic 
syntheses, as well as medical applications as an anesthetic, so this 
deceptively simple molecular structure belongs to a powerful and 
versatile organic compound.
‚Ä¢ 
Starting with its linear cousin, propane, and then cyclizing the 
compound, notice that bonding the two terminal atoms has several 
consequences. First, the terminal carbon atoms must each give 
up a hydrogen to make space available for the cyclizing bond. 
This means that the generic formula for a cyclic alkane is CnH2n, 
compared to CnH2n+2, as in its analogous linear hydrocarbon.

55
‚Ä¢ 
Next, notice that even though all of the carbons are sp3 hybridized 
and, therefore, should have free rotation, they in fact do not. The 
ring structure prohibits the carbon-carbon bond axis from rotating. 
This leads to a new type of isomerism‚Äîone in which the side of the 
ring to which substituents are attached makes a difference. When 
substituents are placed on the same side of the ring, we use the 
term ‚Äúcis‚Äù to describe their relationship. When substituents are on 
opposite sides of the ring, we use the term ‚Äútrans.‚Äù

parent chain is in fact cyclic. So, the three-membered ring that is the 
cousin of propane would be named cyclopropane. Similarly, rings 
of increasing size would be named cyclobutane, cyclopentane, and 
cyclohexane.
‚Ä¢ 
Our next consideration is that those cyclic alkanes with a single 
substituent do not require a number to give that substituent its 
location on the ring. This, of course, stems from the fact that all 
carbons on any unsubstituted ring are equivalent. So, we would 
name this molecule methylcyclobutane.
‚Ä¢ 
When two identical substituents are bonded to the ring, we

around the ring in a manner that gives the lowest second number

compound 1,3-dimethylcyclobutane.

WKH ULQJ DWRPV VWDUWLQJ ZLWK WKH VXEVWLWXHQW WKDW FRPHV ¬øUVW
alphabetically, and then proceed around the ring in a direction that 
leads to the lowest substituent numbers. For example, we would 
name this compound 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclobutane.

56
Lecture 8: Cyclic Alkanes
‚Ä¢ 
But there is more to this structure. Because the carbon-carbon bonds 
can no longer freely rotate, placing two substituents on the same 
side of the ring produces an isomer that is distinct from the one that 
has substituents on opposite sides of the ring. To distinguish these 
isomers, we name them ‚Äúcis‚Äù for the same side and ‚Äútrans‚Äù for the 
opposite sides: cis-1-ethyl-3-methylcyclobutane and trans-1-ethyl-
3-methylcyclobutane.

carbon-carbon bonds must be 60 degrees, because the 3 atoms are 
necessarily coplanar. 
‚Ä¢ 
Yet we already know that sp3 carbons ideally form bond angles of 
109.5 degrees. The fact that the ring structure forces bond angles 
into suboptimal geometries is known as angle strain, sometimes 
also referred to as Baeyer strain, which is named for notable chemist

‚Ä¢ 
Also, if we turn the cyclopropane molecule on its side and produce 
a Newman projection, it becomes clear that all of the substituents 
of this compound are locked in an eclipsed conformation. This 
inability to achieve a staggered conformation is referred to as 
torsional strain.

How Penicillin Works
‚Ä¢ 
Penicillin works by inhibiting an essential enzyme called 
transpepsidase, which is used by certain types of bacteria to build 
their cell walls. When a molecule of penicillin interacts with

considerable ring strain) opens 
as the molecule reacts with 
the enzyme‚Äôs active site‚Äîthe

Conformational Analysis of Cyclohexane
‚Ä¢ 
A strained ring of sp3 atoms can give a molecule powerful 
chemistry. But lack of strain can be every bit as important of a 
feature in a biologically relevant molecule. For example, it is its 
lack of strain that makes cyclohexane a pervasive motif in the 
chemistry of life. We see this structure in powerful hormones like 
human sex hormones testosterone and estrogen, the antibiotic

Bicyclic Compounds
‚Ä¢ 
When two hydrocarbon rings share one or more atoms, we call 
them bicyclic systems. By extension, we might call a molecule 
like testosterone a tetracyclic molecule, because it actually has four 
rings, each of which shares atoms with others. 
‚Ä¢ 
The combination of cyclic structures in alkanes can be accomplished 
in three different ways. When two rings share only a single carbon 
atom, we call this a spiro bicyclic compound. When the rings are 
conjoined by two adjacent carbons, we call them fused, and when 
their linkage is at two nonadjacent carbons, we call them bridged.

‚Ä¢ 
The tetrahedral geometry of this atom leads spiro compounds to 
have a twist to them, sort of like an airplane propeller. This twist 
does not make them inherently chiral, but it does mean that some 
substituted spiro compounds can have a chiral spiro atom.

followed by a bracketed list of the number of atoms in each bridge. 
Finally, just as before, we inventory all of the atoms in the system 
and name this compound.
‚Ä¢ 
What makes fused bicyclics so interesting from a structural 
perspective is their ability to form two different isomers: one in 
which the hydrogens on the shared carbons are anti to one another 
and a second in which they are gauche. We call these isomers 
trans-decaline and cis-decaline. And it should be clear from the 
two structures that the trans isomer is a bit more stable than its cis 
isomer, because it has only two gauche interactions, compared to 
three in the cis isomer.
‚Ä¢ 
Because it is more stable, it is not surprising that the trans-
decaline geometry is the one we see in most biomolecules, such as

different than their trans isomer.
‚Ä¢ 
Finally, when two rings are joined by sharing two nonadjacent 
carbons, we refer to these as ‚Äúbridged‚Äù bicyclic compounds. We 
start by writing ‚Äúbicyclo‚Äù to show that we are talking about a 
bicyclic compound, and then we identify the size of each bridge 
created by the geometries. This is done in brackets, longest bridge 
to shortest bridge. Finally, we name the compound based on the 
total number of atoms in the entire fused bicyclic structure.

almost always a sigma bond. The electrons in these bonds occupy 
the area along the internuclear axis, so they can rotate like the axle 
of a car without any meaningful energetic input.
‚Ä¢ 
But pi bonds are quite different. During the formation of double

region of space to inhabit‚Äîone that still screens the two nuclei 
from one another but does not occupy the space directly between 
them, because the original sigma bond electrons already have claim 
to that space.
‚Ä¢ 
Pi bonds form as a consequence of side-on overlap of u-hybridized 
atomic p orbitals. The shape of the p orbitals allows them to overlap 
in a region above or below the internuclear axis. This leads to two 
distinct differences between pi bonds and sigma bonds. 
‚Ä¢ 
7KH ¬øUVW LV WKDW GRXEOH DQG WULSOH ERQGV FDQQRW URWDWH IUHHO\ WKH
way single bonds can. Rotation of the bond would require that the 
pi bond be broken completely, leaving only the remaining sigma  
bond intact.

63
‚Ä¢ 
The second is that pi bonds are weaker than sigma bonds. Being 
located in a less centralized molecular orbital means that pi 
electrons tend to be held less tightly in the resulting bonding orbital. 
This means that less energy is required to break a pi bond. 
‚Ä¢

leaving the sigma bond intact, if the proper energy is provided. 
So, the atoms can be kept connected even while free rotation is  
temporarily restored.
‚Ä¢ 
Pi bonds make up the second and third pair of electrons in double 
and triple bonds, respectively. However, there is no such thing as a

geometrically impossible to obtain the orbital alignments required 
to form a carbon-carbon quadruple bond.
Alkenes and Alkynes
‚Ä¢ 
Hydrocarbons like alkanes, consisting of only sigma-bonded 
hydrogen and carbon atoms, are called saturated hydrocarbons. 
Conversely, hydrocarbons that contain pi bonds are sometimes 
collectively 
referred 
to 
as 
unsaturated hydrocarbons. 
‚Ä¢ 
At the most basic level of 
organization, there are saturated 
hydrocarbons, which are also 
called alkanes, and two classes 
of unsaturated hydrocarbons‚Äî
those with a double bond, called 
alkenes, and those with a triple 
bond, called alkynes. 
‚Ä¢ 
The simplest possible hydrocarbon containing a double bond is 
ethene, which is also known by the more common name ethylene. 
Ethylene is a naturally occurring alkene and a plant hormone that is 
critical to the ripening process in a number of fruits and vegetables.

Lecture 9: Alkenes and Alkynes
‚Ä¢ 
Ethylene has a molecular formula of C2H4, and its generic 
molecular formula is CnH2n. This is the generic molecular formula 
for all simple alkene hydrocarbons (‚Äúsimple‚Äù means having just 
one double bond in the hydrocarbon) like propylene, butylene,  
and beyond.
‚Ä¢ 
The simplest possible alkyne is a compound called acetylene. 
This compound is most well known for its use as a torch fuel, but 
just like ethylene, its reactive pi bonds also make it a very useful 
synthetic precursor to many important compounds. 
‚Ä¢ 
Ethylene has a molecular formula of C2H2, and its generic molecular 
formula turns out to be CnH2n√≠. All simple alkyne hydrocarbons, 
such as methylacetylene and ethylacetylene, will have this  
generic formula.
‚Ä¢ 
When the localized pi system of an alkene or alkyne is in the 
middle of a longer carbon chain, we call this an internal alkene or 
an internal alkyne. When the pi system is instead at the end of a 
chain, we call them terminal alkenes and terminal alkynes.
Naming Alkenes and Alkynes
‚Ä¢ 
The presence of weaker‚Äîand, therefore, more reactive‚Äîpi 
bonds gives alkenes and alkynes a special place among motifs 
in nomenclature. We call them functional groups rather than 
substituents. As functional groups, they receive special attention

are indicated not at the beginning of a molecule‚Äôs name like 
substituents, but rather at the end.
‚Ä¢ 
For example, a three-carbon alkane would be called propane. 
,QVHUWLRQ RI D GRXEOH ERQG OHDGV WR SURSHQH DQG FRQYHUVLRQ RI
this to a triple bond gives us propyne. Note that it is the VXI¬ø[ that 
indicates the presence of the functional group: ‚Äú-ane‚Äù for simple 
alkanes, ‚Äú-ene‚Äù for alkenes, and ‚Äú-yne‚Äù for alkynes.

Stereoisomers of Alkenes
‚Ä¢ 
Vladimir Markovnikov and Aleksandr Zaitsev were two of the 
PRVWLQ√ÄXHQWLDOFKHPLVWVLQWKHGHYHORSPHQWRIWKHXQGHUVWDQGLQJ
of alkenes. They were contemporaries studying under another great 
chemist, Aleksandr Butlerov, in the Russian system in the 1870s. 
‚Ä¢ 
With respect to the stability of alkenes, Markovnikov believed that 
less-substituted alkenes, such as 1-butene, were more stable, while 
Zaitsev held the opposing view‚Äîthat more-substituted alkenes, 
VXFKDVEXWHQHZHUHPRUHVWDEOH,QWKLVFUXFLDOGHEDWH=DLWVHY
proved victorious with a paper published in 1875.
‚Ä¢ 
Just as with hydrocarbon radicals, alkenes have pRUELWDOV,QWKLV
case, they are participating in bonding with an adjacent p orbital, 
but they can still align with other hybrid orbitals on adjacent carbon 
atoms. So, more adjacent carbon atoms means more places for 
electrons to move, which leads to extra stability.
‚Ä¢ 
Zaitsev used an alcohol dehydration reaction to demonstrate that 
alkenes of higher substitution are indeed more stable. Zaitsev 
needed to use this system because, frankly, it was one of very 
few understood reactions in his day. Modern chemists can much 

66
Lecture 9: Alkenes and Alkynes
more easily verify Zaitsev‚Äôs conclusions. Today, we often compare 
the stability of unsaturated hydrocarbons using the technique  
of calorimetry. 
‚Ä¢ 
,Q D FDORULPHWU\ H[SHULPHQW D UHDFWLRQ LV DOORZHG WR UXQ WR
completion in a closed, well-insulated vessel, and the temperature 
of the contents is monitored. On completion of the reaction, 
the amount of chemical potential energy gained or lost by the 
reacting molecules is proportional to the temperature change of the 
surroundings within the calorimeter.
‚Ä¢ 
Conducting a simple calorimetry experiment gives us great insight 
into the factors affecting alkene stability. An equal quantity of 
1-butene releases more heat when hydrogenated, which validates 
Zaitsev‚Äôs rule. We also see that not only is Zaitsev‚Äôs rule validated, 
but the geometric arrangement of larger substituents also appears 
to affect stabilities, with (E)-2-butene being more stable than (Z)-
2-butene.
‚Ä¢ 
The difference in stability between the (E) and (Z) isomers is 
usually attributed to sterics‚Äîthat is, the physical proximity of 
substituent electron clouds in the molecule. Placing two larger alkyl 
substituents close to one another, as in the (Z) isomer, causes a 
natural repulsion that is not present when those substituents are at 
opposition in the (E) isomer.
‚Ä¢ 
Not surprisingly, internal alkynes also prove more stable than 
their external counterparts. So, we see the same trend that Zaitsev 
would predict for internal and terminal alkynes, though the linear 
geometry of these compounds precludes any geometric isomerism.
Alkynes and Acidity
‚Ä¢ 
We know from the geometry of a carbon-carbon triple bond that 
alkynes are not capable of the kind of stereoisomerism that makes 
alkenes so fascinating. But that doesn‚Äôt make them uninteresting. 
Alkynes have their own properties that make them interesting to 
organic chemists.

67
‚Ä¢ 
2QHYHU\LQWHUHVWLQJSURSHUW\RIDON\QHVLVWKHLUDFLGLW\,QWHUQDO
alkynes do not have a very acidic proton, because all of their 
hydrogens are on sp3 carbons, just like an alkane. The pKa of a 
terminal alkyne, however, is about 26, which may seem like a very 
weak acid, and in fact it is.
‚Ä¢ 
But compared to the acidity of alkenes, with a pKa of about 44, 
and of alkanes, whose pKa is about 60, alkynes start to look like 
a pretty acidic compound. So, at a pKa of 26, terminal alkynes are 
weak acids in the overall scheme of things, but they are rock stars 
of acidity among hydrocarbons. 
‚Ä¢ 
,QIDFWWKHUHDUHMXVWDIHZEDVHVDYDLODEOHWRXVLQWKHODERUDWRU\¬≤
albeit very strong ones‚Äîthat are capable of deprotonating terminal 
alkynes. Most notable of these is the amide ion, the conjugate acid 
of ammonia, which has a pKaRIDERXW,WLVQRWHDV\WRZRUN
with, but it is available.
‚Ä¢ 
So, what is the source of this acidity in compounds like acetylene 
and propyne? The answer is that alkyne carbons are sp hybridized. 
Heterolytically breaking the carbon-hydrogen bond means that 
both bonding electrons will go to the carbon. This means that the 
hybrid orbital into which the bonding electrons go has about 50% 
s character, as opposed to about 33% s character for an alkene and 
25% s character for an alkane.

68
Lecture 9: Alkenes and Alkynes
‚Ä¢ 
S orbitals hold their electrons tighter and closer to the nucleus than 
do p orbitals of the same principle energy level. So, more s character 
in a hybrid orbital means a more stable lone pair in that orbital. And 
a more stable conjugate base means a more acidic conjugate acid.
‚Ä¢ 
These deprotonated alkynes are remarkably reactive compared to 
neutral hydrocarbons, and they can prove very useful reagents in 
the synthesis of other organic compounds.
Cyclic Alkenes and Alkynes
‚Ä¢ 
Just as alkanes can be cyclic, so can alkenes and alkynes. Cyclic 
alkenes and cyclic alkynes follow many of the same rules as 
cyclic alkanes, but with two important considerations. First, just 
like with linear and branched hydrocarbons, the presence of the 
pi system usually makes them much more reactive than similar 
alkane counterparts.
‚Ä¢ 
Second, the inclusion of a double bond (with sp2 carbons and angles 
of about 120 degrees) or a triple bond (with sp carbons and a bond

stabilizing the cis isomer.

So, the molecule commonly called propyl chloride would be 
considered a primary alkyl halide because of its single R group. 
Next is isopropyl chloride, which has two R groups attached to

alkyl halide. Finally, the simplest tertiary alkyl halide is

Physical Properties of Alkyl Halides
‚Ä¢ 
Halogens are much larger and more electronegative than hydrogen, 
and their presence on the molecule has two important effects. First, 
the size of the halogen atoms means that their large electron clouds 
are more polarizable. This makes them better suited to create the 
intermittent dipoles needed to form strong London dispersion 
forces, increasing their boiling point when compared to their 
alkane cousins.

72
Lecture 10: Alkyl Halides
‚Ä¢ 
Second, the electronegativity of the halogen produces a permanent 
dipole in the carbon-halogen bond. The halogen will have a 
permanent partial negative charge, and the carbon will have a 
permanent partial positive charge. The dipoles of each type of 
carbon-halogen bond are very similar because the bond dipole is a 
function not only of electronegativity, but also of the bond length.
‚Ä¢ 
The addition of a single halogen to an alkane backbone leads to a 
molecule with a much larger electron cloud. These large electron 
clouds lead to greater polarizability and, thus, stronger London 
dispersion forces. This trends when we increase the size of the 
bonded halogen. This principle also leads us to the conclusion that 
the number of bonded halogens will have an effect.

is refrigeration.
Reactivity of Alkyl Halides
‚Ä¢ 
Alkyl halides are also valued in synthetic organic chemistry for 
their balance of stability and reactivity. Many alkyl halides will 
keep in a bottle on a shelf for years but can be converted into other 
useful reagents in a matter of minutes or hours in the lab.
‚Ä¢ 
They key to this balance of stability and reactivity lies in the fact 
that carbon-halogen bonds are inherently fairly strong but polarized. 
$YHUDJH FDUERQ√ÄXRULQH DQG FDUERQFKORULQH ERQG HQWKDOSLHV DUH
similar to that of a carbon-carbon bond. Even carbon-bromine 
bonds are quite strong. This means that in the absence of other 
reagents, most alkyl halides have a long shelf life.
‚Ä¢ 
But unlike carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-halogen bonds are polar. 
The more electronegative halogen pulls the bonding electrons 
closer to itself, creating a mild permanent charge separation across 
the bond. 
‚Ä¢ 
Although some alkyl halides that contain many bonded halogen 
atoms are exploited for their physical properties, synthetic organic 
chemists more frequently use alkyl halides containing only one 
or a few halogens so that subsequent chemical reactions are more  
site-directed.
‚Ä¢ 
Furthermore, in the low-pressure, high-energy environment of the 
troposphere, radicals can easily form, but they are far less common 
in the lab. Organic chemists much more frequently rely on the 
tendency of halogens to accept the full bonding pair in a process 
known as heterolytic bond cleavage. Accepting both electrons from 
the bond produces a halide ion (which is much more stable than 
a halogen radical) and a positively charged hydrocarbon species 
known as a carbocation.

75
‚Ä¢ 
The tendency of this process to happen spontaneously in an alkyl 
halide is a result of two factors: the stability of the halide ion and the 
stability of the resulting carbocation. So, the key to predicting how 
a particular alkyl halide will react lies in being able to understand 
the factors contributing to the stability of those two products.
‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs focus on the halide ion. Fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide 
all have a single charge and a complete octet in their outermost 
energy level. So, they are all fairly stable from an octet-rule 
perspective. However, there is a steady trend of increasing stability 
LQWKLVVHWDVZHJRIURPVPDOOHUWRODUJHULRQV,QJHQHUDOt-butyl 
iodide more rapidly dissociates into a halide and a carbocation than 
does t-butyl bromide, which is faster than t-butyl chloride, which 
outpaces tEXW\O√ÄXRULGH
‚Ä¢ 
Next, we have to consider the resulting carbocation and its 
substitution. Carbocations contain a positively charged carbon 
atom with only three bonds to itself. So, the charged carbon has 
only six valence electrons; therefore, it does not have a complete 
RFWHW,QVWHDGLWKDVWKUHHFRSODQDUsp2 hybridized orbitals bonded 
to hydrogens or R groups, and it has a vacant p orbital. 
‚Ä¢ 
We observe in the lab that just like radicals and alkenes, 
FDUERFDWLRQVRIKLJKHUVXEVWLWXWLRQDUHPRUHVWDEOH,QRWKHUZRUGV
tertiary carbocations (those having three R groups, like the t-butyl 
cation) form more readily than do secondary carbocations (like the 
isopropyl cation). Similarly, primary carbocations (like the ethyl 
cation) are rarely ever seen in the lab. Finally, methyl cations, 
which have no R groups, are least stable of all. The reason for this 
trend in carbocation stability is hyperconjugation.

should be emphasized that this is a general rule and that there will 
be exceptions‚Äîparticularly when we start to consider the effect 
that solvents can have on reactions.

Lecture 10: Alkyl Halides
Carbocation Rearrangements
‚Ä¢ 
Carbocations and species like them make regular appearances in 
many common reaction mechanisms, so it is worth shining the 
spotlight on them. One very unusual property of these species is 
their ability to rearrange one or more of their bonds to increase 
their stability.
‚Ä¢ 
The substitution of a carbocation can have a profound effect on its 
stability, with tertiary cations being more stable than secondary, 
and so on. Molecules have a natural tendency to take on lower 
energy forms through chemical processes, and carbocations are no 
exception to this rule.
‚Ä¢ 
Carbocations sometimes can alter their own structure through a 
process known as rearrangement. These arrangements can take 
place in two ways: secondary (meaning that it takes place after the 
carbocation forms) or concerted (meaning that it takes place as the 
carbocation forms). They can also take place by two mechanisms: 
hydride shifts and alkyl shifts. 
‚Ä¢ 
Carbocation rearrangements can be either a supreme annoyance, 
against which we must guard, or a clever trick, used to devise

Strong nucleophiles and low-substitution substrates favor the SN2, while 
weak nucleophiles and highly substituted substrates favor the SN1. You 
will also learn the effect each pathway has on the retention of chirality in 
substrates as they undergo substitution. Finally, you will consider solvent 
selection for substitution reactions. 
Substitution Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
Any substitution reaction will have the same basic cast of 
characters: a nucleophile, a substrate, an electrophile, and a leaving

are those groups that easily withdraw their bonding electrons 
to become a separate, stable species. Finally, the entire molecule 
undergoing substitution is the substrate. 
‚Ä¢ 
With a nucleophile and a leaving group both in the mix, there are 
three potential permutations of a substitution reaction: one in which 
the nucleophile ¬øUVW attacks, and then the leaving group departs; 
one in which the nucleophile attacks as the leaving group departs; 
and one in which the nucleophile attacks only after the leaving  
group departs.

require that a transition state form in which the electrophilic carbon 
has more than eight valence electrons. But the other two are equally 
valid possibilities still remaining: one in which simultaneous attack 
and departure maintains a balance of eight valence electrons around 
carbon throughout the transition, and one in which initial departure 
of the leaving group produces a carbocation intermediate with only 
six valence electrons.

of organic chemistry is his 1933 description of these two possible 
pathways by which substitution may take place. We call these reaction 
pathways SN2 and SN1 (substitution-nucleophilic-bimolecular and 
substitution-nucleophilic-unimolecular, respectively). 
‚Ä¢ 
Any mechanism, no matter how complex, will have what is called 
a rate-limiting step. This is the slowest elementary step in the 
PHFKDQLVPDQGLWGH¬øQHVWKHUDWHRIWKHUHDFWLRQ-XVWDVDFKDLQ
is only as strong as its weakest link, a reaction is only as fast as 
its slowest step. The rate-limiting step and all steps before it are 
affected to some extent by the concentrations of reagents involved 
in those steps.

chemistry, we use a rate proportionality constant, k, to produce the 
rate law for a reaction.
‚Ä¢ 
So, a reaction in which two reagents react in a single, concerted 
step should have kinetics that are proportional to the concentration 
of both reagents. We call this a second-order reaction. But if one 
reagent slowly undergoes a change all by itself in the rate-limiting 
step before reacting with the second reagent, then the rate will only 
depend on the concentration of the dissociating reagent. We call

reagent concentration.

function and reactivity. He observed that not only did two 
substitution pathways exist, but also that the tendency of reactions 
to proceed by one or the other was predictable based on correlated 
structural features in the starting materials. 
The SN2 Reaction Pathway
‚Ä¢ 
The second-order nucleophilic substitution pathway, SN2, is 
characterized by a bimolecular reaction in which a nucleophile 
attacks and a leaving group departs simultaneously. Because it is 
the nucleophile‚Äôs attack that initiates the leaving group‚Äôs departure, 
the attack must take place from the opposite side of the substrate in 
order to break the bond to the leaving group. We call this orientation 
a backside attack. 
‚Ä¢ 
This type of reaction is expected to take place in a single, concerted 
step. With only one elementary step in this reaction, we expect that 
the reaction rate will be affected equally by the concentration of 
both starting materials.
‚Ä¢ 
The key to a reaction running by the SN2 mechanism lies primarily 
in two factors: strong (reactive) nucleophiles, like hydroxide, and 
less-substituted electrophiles, like methyl chloride. Let‚Äôs consider 
each one of these factors individually.

81
‚Ä¢ 
A strong nucleophile like hydroxide is inherently unstable. The 
high density of negative charge around the oxygen atom is the 
source of this instability, and hydroxide will seek to relieve it at its 
earliest chance. Another crucial feature is the degree of substitution 
at the electrophile. Hydroxide may be poised to attack, but it cannot 
attack what it cannot get to. 
‚Ä¢ 
Methyl chloride is an excellent choice of substrate for an SN2 
reaction, because the three hydrogen substituents leave the region 
of the molecule opposite the leaving group exposed. Consider 
the analogous reaction with t-butyl chloride‚Äîa tertiary substrate. 
Nucleophiles simply cannot get to the electrophilic carbon of a 
tertiary substrate, no matter how badly they may want to react.
The SN1 Reaction Pathway
‚Ä¢ 
What if we attempt to react a weak nucleophile with a highly 
substituted substrate, instead of reacting a strong nucleophile 
with substrates of low substitution? Let‚Äôs consider water reacting 
with t-butyl chloride. Water is clearly a weaker nucleophile than 
K\GUR[LGH ,W KDV ORQH SDLUV RI HOHFWURQV RQ LWV R[\JHQ EXW ODFNV
the negative charge that made the hydroxide attack with such 
urgency. And t-butyl chloride has three methyl substituents 
RQ WKH HOHFWURSKLOLF FDUERQ PDNLQJ DWWDFN GLI¬øFXOW HYHQ IRU D 
strong nucleophile. 
‚Ä¢ 
A patient nucleophile like water with nowhere to attack will simply 
wait, biding its time until something more accessible and reactive 
SUHVHQWVLWVHOI,QWKHFDVHRIt-butyl chloride, this happens when the 
chloride ion departs on its own, leaving behind a carbocation.
‚Ä¢ 
A t-butyl cation is a distinctively more attractive substrate for two 
reasons: The electrophilic carbon now has only six valence electrons 
and a full positive charge, and its new planar arrangement of 
substituents means that it is much more accessible to nucleophiles. 
This cation is practically begging to be attacked by even the 
weakest of nucleophiles.

82

(and rate limiting) of two steps in the reaction process. Because 
the nucleophilic attack happens after the slow formation of the 
carbocation, the nucleophile‚Äôs concentration no longer affects the 
rate of this reaction.

were to react a chiral substrate by SN2‚Äîfor example, enantiopure  
(R)-2-chlorobutane‚Äîwe can expect an enantiopure product to

affects the rate of SN2, but not of SN1. This is a consequence of its 
absence in the rate-limiting step of the SN1 pathway. But reagent 
concentration is not the only way to alter the rate of the SN1 and SN2 
UHDFWLRQVWRRXUEHQH¬øW
‚Ä¢ 
Because the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms differ in the chemistry 
of their rate-limiting steps, it stands to reason that their rates can 
be affected differently by changes in the surrounding chemical 
environment. Usually, this environment is a liquid solvent in which 
they are dissolved. 
‚Ä¢ 
SN2 is a nice, concerted mechanism taking place in a single step. SN2 
reactions are characterized by the presence of strong nucleophiles, 
which tend to have high negative charge density‚Äîspecies like 
hydroxide. Let‚Äôs consider the effect of running an SN2 reaction 
between methyl chloride and hydroxide starting materials.
‚Ä¢ 
The starting material includes a hydroxide with a full, localized 
negative charge. The reaction then proceeds through a transition 
state in which that negative charge is spread out across the 
nucleophile and the leaving group. So, the transition state has less 
charge density. Of course, there are other factors making it less 
stable than the starting materials, such as the two bonds in the 
process of breaking and forming.
‚Ä¢ 
But the fact remains that the activation energy of the reaction is 
simply the difference in energy between the two states. So, anything 
that we can do to close that energy gap will speed up the reaction. 
Anything we can do destabilize the starting material more than the 
intermediate will accelerate the reaction.

84
Lecture 11: Substitution Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
One of the easiest ways to do this is to choose the right solvent. As 
you might imagine, solvents of low polarity, like the hydrocarbon 
hexane, do not interact well with charged nucleophiles, leaving 
them highly reactive and, therefore, more likely to attack. The 
problem that sometimes arises in this situation, however, is that 
charged nucleophiles simply aren‚Äôt soluble in nonpolar solvents, so 
we have to choose carefully.
‚Ä¢ 
We sometimes classify solvents based not only on their 
polarity, but also on their acidity. We call solvents like acetone, 
dimethylsulfoxide, and acetonitrile ‚Äúpolar aprotic,‚Äù because they 
lack any acidic hydrogens. Conversely, solvents like isopropanol, 
ethanol, and water are called ‚Äúpolar protic.‚Äù All of these solvents 
have a strong molecular dipole, but the real difference is in the 
orientation of that dipole. 
‚Ä¢ 
All of the aprotic solvents have their dipole oriented with the 
negative end at the surface of the molecule, while all of the protic 
solvents have their dipole oriented with the positive charge density 
at the periphery of the molecule and the negative end buried 
deep within.
‚Ä¢ 
While low-polarity, or polar aprotic, solvents tend to accelerate SN2 
reactions, polar solvents in general accelerate SN1 reactions. This is 
a good general rule for prototypical substitution mechanisms, but 
there are many exceptions to this rule.

(E1) elimination reactions. You will also learn how the strength of 
the base dictates the order of the reaction and how extremely bulky bases 
combined with more-substituted beta carbons can lead to a situation in which 
Zaitsev‚Äôs rule fails to accurately predict the major product. Finally, you will 
discover that substitution and elimination frequently compete with one 
another and that certain reaction conditions‚Äîmost notably temperature‚Äî
can be altered to promote the desired mechanism.
The Elimination Reaction
‚Ä¢ 
Alkyl halides and other compounds containing good leaving 
groups need not necessarily undergo substitution reactions. There 
is another class of reactions in which these types of compounds

leaving group, a pi bond is formed by the loss of an adjacent proton, 
which we call the beta proton.
‚Ä¢ 
Elimination reactions always proceed with the production of 
a by-product formed by the leaving group but do not consume a 
nucleophile molecule in the process. So, in contrast to substitution 
reactions, elimination reactions are not entropically neutral but, 
rather, proceed with an increase in entropy, making two or more 
molecules from one.
‚Ä¢ 
This is a good thing, because the exchange of sigma bonds for 
a pi bond means that the enthalpy of this reaction is not usually 
favorable. So, elimination reactions are driven by factors like 
increased heat and time as well as the formation of stable leaving 
groups and alkene products. Eliminations are always a possibility

when this competing pathway becomes dominant that we call the 
reaction an elimination.
E1 and E2 Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
Completing an elimination reaction requires that two things be 
removed from the starting material: a stable leaving group and a 
beta proton from an adjacent carbon. Russian chemist Aleksandr 
Zaitsev‚Äôs theory that more-substituted alkenes would form in these 
reactions proved true. Vladimir Markovnikov instead hung his hat 
on a theory called microscopic reversibility. Having observed that 
alkyl halides of low substitution could be used to prepare alkenes, 
he theorized that reversing the reaction should produce the original 
starting material.
‚Ä¢

once again left his mark on organic chemistry by recognizing that 
there were three potential mechanisms that had to be considered: 
departure of a leaving group after deprotonation, departure of a 
leaving group during deprotonation, and departure of a leaving 
group before deprotonation.
‚Ä¢ 
,QWKH¬øUVWSRVVLELOLW\UHPRYDORIDEHWDSURWRQIURPDQDON\OKDOLGH
would require a very strong base. We know that protons don‚Äôt just 
fall off of molecules on their own; they need a suitable base to 
accept them. Because alkyl halide beta protons have a pKa of about 
50, any base strong enough to accomplish this would be practically 
unusable in a laboratory environment. We would be hard-pressed to

being acidic enough to be deprotonated by it as well.
‚Ä¢ 
The second possibility‚Äîsimultaneous deprotonation and leaving

possibility is also acceptable, generating a carbocation intermediate 
that gives our electron pair holding the beta hydrogen a place to go

Lecture 12: Elimination Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
So, just as in the case of substitution, we are left pondering two 
believable mechanisms for the elimination of an alkyl halide 
to form an alkene: one with a rate dependent only on substrate 
concentration and another dependent on both substrate and  
base concentration.

in each potential reaction mechanism was a base accepting the 
beta proton from the substrate, but in one mechanism the base 
participated in the rate-limiting step, while in the other it did not. 
Kinetic studies were the key to unlocking the rules governing these 
two mechanisms.
The E2 Reaction Pathway
‚Ä¢ 
The E2 reaction pathway involves simultaneous deprotonation and 
leaving group departure. Nucleophiles are electron-rich species 
that have high negative charge density and lone-pair electrons to 
donate in heterogenic bond formation. Another type of reagent 
that has a very similar set of properties to nucleophiles is a Lewis 
base. Because nucleophiles and bases have similar properties, it is 
possible for nucleophiles to also act as bases.
‚Ä¢ 
SN2 reactions take place when strong nucleophiles attack a substrate 
of low substitution. But what happens if the nucleophile is strong 
like hydroxide but the substrate is of high substitution, like 
t-butyl chloride? The nucleophile, unable to attack the obstructed 
electrophile, will not wait to react. When nucleophilic attack is not 
possible, it will instead react as a base. 
‚Ä¢ 
Deprotonation of a beta carbon seems like the next-best alternative 
to satiate this reactive species, but simple deprotonation would be 
a highly disfavored reaction because of the low pKa of alkyl halide 
beta protons.
‚Ä¢ 
But there is a second process that can be coupled to beta proton 
UHPRYDOWKHGHSDUWXUHRIWKHOHDYLQJJURXS,WLVWKLVVLPXOWDQHRXV
removal of the beta proton, departure of the leaving group, and 

89
formation of a new double bond that all come together to form a 
single-step process that results in the formation of an alkene. 
‚Ä¢ 
A beta proton that is at opposition to the leaving group is the one 
that will be removed. Remember that leaving groups in second-
order reactions depart when electrons move in from the backside

E2 substrate, the bond holding the acidic proton must be on the 
backside of the molecule from the leaving group. This orientation 
is achieved when the beta proton has a 180-degree dihedral angle 
relative to the leaving group. We call this orientation anti-coplanar.

‚Ä¢ 
A very weak base is a species that can accept a proton only under 
extreme conditions. Usually, this means a neutral compound, such 
as a molecule of solvent, or one that is negatively charged but has 
lots of resonance to help stabilize that charge. 
‚Ä¢ 
So, let‚Äôs consider the same substrate as before but with a weak

is no strong nucleophile to be found. So, what is a carbocation

The distinguishing property of E1 reactions is that they tend to 
run best under acidic conditions (no good nucleophile) and at high 
temperatures (favoring systems of greater entropy).

‚Ä¢ 
One consideration that sets second-order elimination, or E2, 
reactions apart from second-order substitution, SN2, is the wide 
variety of possible products that might form from the same 
combination of reagents. For example, unlike the SN2 pathway‚Äî
which involves the attack of a nucleophile on the carbon-bearing 
leaving group, giving it only one potential reactive site‚Äîthe E2 
reaction requires the abstraction of an adjacent proton, of which 
there may be many.
‚Ä¢ 
All of the beta protons of a t-butyl halide are equivalent, eliminating 
this consideration. But most substrates for elimination reactions are

arise quickly.
‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs consider an elimination reaction that can produce two different 
SURGXFWV 7DNH WKH H[DPSOH RI EURPRPHWK\OEXWDQH ,I ZH
were to react this secondary alkyl halide with hydroxide ion, there 
would be two chemically distinct types of beta protons. Removal 
of a primary proton leads to 3-methyl-1-butene, but removal of the 
secondary beta proton leads to 3-methyl-2-butene. So, which is the 
main product of the reaction?
‚Ä¢ 
,QVLWXDWLRQVOLNHWKLVWKHPRUHVXEVWLWXWHGDONHQHSURGXFWWHQGVWR
be the major product of the reaction. Zaitsev‚Äôs rule states that the 
major product of an elimination reaction will be the most substituted 
alkene possible. So, applying Zaitsev‚Äôs rule to our problem of 
2-bromo-3-methylbutane with hydroxide gives us the trisubstituted 
product in greater abundance than the monosubstituted product. By 
extension, Zaitsev‚Äôs rule accurately predicts the major products of 
these elimination reactions as well.
‚Ä¢ 
We can safely apply Zaitsev‚Äôs rule for E2 reactions when the base is 
particularly small, like the hydroxide in the previous example. The 
picture can, however, become a bit more complicated when we use 

91
bulkier bases like t-butoxide. When we attempt to react t-butoxide 
with 2-bromo-3-methylbutane to obtain an elimination product, we 
run into a little snag.
‚Ä¢ 
,QIDFWt-butoxide is much larger than hydroxide, and sterics make 
it tough for this powerful base to physically get into contact with 
the tertiary beta proton. With no access to the electrophilic carbon 
for backside attack‚Äînor to the tertiary beta proton‚Äîthe base is 
forced to take its third choice: the methyl proton, leading to the 
less-substituted alkene as the major product. We sometimes refer

with E2 reactions, we need to be careful to consider how an E1 
might produce multiple products of varying stability. We have 
already established that E1 reactions are expected to proceed 
through a carbocation intermediate. This has two important 
LQ√ÄXHQFHVRQWKHSURGXFWVIRUPHGE\WKLVUHDFWLRQ
‚Ä¢ 
First, the carbocation is planar, which means that they form a planar 
intermediate, making even more sterically obstructed beta protons 
accessible to the weak base. This means that E1 reactions are less 
prone to form Hoffman products.
‚Ä¢ 
So, the reaction of water with 2-bromo-2-methylpentane forms 
2-methyl-2butene just as the analogous E2 reaction. But reaction 
with t-butanol‚Äîa bulky, weak base‚Äîhas little effect. We still 
get the Zaitsev product as the major species. But there is another 
FRQVLGHUDWLRQ WKDW DOZD\V FRPHV ZLWK ¬øUVWRUGHU UHDFWLRQV
carbocation rearrangements.
‚Ä¢ 
So, the reaction of water with 2-bromo-3,4-dimethylpentane 
will produce a carbocation that can not only undergo a 
secondary rearrangement, but will then form the tetrasubstituted  
Zaitsev product.

Lecture 12: Elimination Reactions
Stereochemistry of Elimination Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
When we work with elimination reactions, just like with substitution 
UHDFWLRQVZHPXVWQRWRQO\FRQVLGHUUHJLRVSHFL¬øFLW\EXWDOVRWKH
possible effects on the stereochemistry of the products. Because the 
product of this reaction is an alkene, of course there is no potential 
for a chiral center to form in the product, but a stereocenter may yet 
be produced in the form of cis-trans isomers.
Elimination in Cyclic Alkyl Halides
‚Ä¢ 
Just as with cyclic alkanes, there is an associated ring strain in 
smaller cyclic alkyl halides that means that the carbon-carbon bonds 
making up the ring cannot freely rotate. This can pose a serious 
problem. The ring restricts rotation of the bond between alpha and 
beta carbons and simply will not allow the tertiary beta proton to 
achieve the necessary anti-coplanar alignment. The ability of cyclic 
alkyl halides to undergo E2 reactions is also severely limited by 
the need for the halide to be in an axial position for the proper  
orbital alignments. 
Competition between Substitution and Elimination
‚Ä¢ 
Substitution and elimination reactions are seldom found occurring 
exclusively, and they often compete with one another. The key 
to divining which mechanism will prevail is in the reaction 
conditions. Recall that the Gibbs free energy equation is a function 
of temperature. So, the extent to which entropy contributes to 
a process‚Äôs spontaneity is a function of temperature. Higher 
temperature means that entropy has a greater role.
‚Ä¢ 
,QFUHDVLQJ WHPSHUDWXUH PDNHV WKH LQFUHDVHG HQWURS\ RI WKH
elimination products more favored. So, if we have a reaction with 
competing substitution and elimination pathways, one way to tip 
the scales in the direction we want is to use heat.
‚Ä¢ 
Strong bases favor second-order reactions. Lower temperatures favor 
substitution. Higher temperatures with small, strong bases favor 
elimination to form the Zaitsev product, while higher temperatures 
with bulky bases favor the anti-Zaitsev elimination product.

Furthermore, you will learn how two chemists developed a chemistry that is

about the methods used to halt hydrogenation of alkynes at the alkene stage. 
Addition Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
Addition reactions involve the replacement of a pi bond with 
new sigma bonds to new substrates, meaning that these reactions 
tend to be entropically disfavored, creating fewer molecules than 
they consume. But from an enthalpic standpoint, they are usually 
favored, because the newly created sigma bonds are lower in energy 
and more stable than the pi bonds in the starting materials. 
‚Ä¢ 
Consider the reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons‚Äîalkenes 
and alkynes. The presence of a pi bond gives them an ability to 
act as nucleophiles themselves instead of a substrate, using their pi 
electrons to attack electrophilic species.
‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs consider what happens when an alkene like propene attacks 
a generic electrophile. The propene molecule sees an opportunity 
to convert its pi-bonding electrons into more stable sigma-bonding 
electrons by attacking the electrophile, but doing so means that 
the resulting species must take on a positive charge, becoming a 
carbocation. So, the tables have turned; the original nucleophile 
LVQRZDQHOHFWURSKLOH7KHDGMDFHQWFDUERQLVHOHFWURQGH¬øFLHQW
positively charged, and ready to be attacked itself by anything 
nucleophilic enough to do so.

95
Addition of Hydrogen Halides to Alkenes
‚Ä¢ 
Before his epic clash with Aleksandr Zaitsev over the regiochemistry 
of elimination reactions, Vladimir Markovnikov had already made 
a name for himself by publishing his famous rule governing the 
regiochemistry of addition reactions. These addition reactions can 
be used to produce alkyl halides from alkenes. We call this class of 
reactions hydrohalogenation because the reaction involves adding a 
molecule of HCl or HBr across a double bond.
‚Ä¢ 
Even though he was never quite certain exactly how it happened, 
Markovnikov was able to demonstrate that anytime an alkene with 
sp2 carbons of differing substitution, like propene, was reacted with 
a hydrogen halide like hydrochloric acid, the newly added halogen 
is always added preferentially to the more-substituted carbon of the 
alkene, and the hydrogen ended up on the less-substituted carbon.
‚Ä¢ 
The key to understanding exactly why Markovnikov‚Äôs rule holds 
only became available some 30 years later, when the carbocation 
VWUXFWXUH ZDV ¬øUVW SURSRVHG :KHQ SURSHQH DWWDFNV K\GURFKORULF
acid, its nucleophilic pi electrons naturally seek out the most

hydrogen of HCl, which is very electron-depleted, owing to the 
presence of the electronegative chlorine.
‚Ä¢ 
,QHVVHQFHWKHDONHQHLVDFWLQJDVDEDVHDFFHSWLQJDSURWRQIURP
the strong acid HCl. But this is a very special nucleophilic base, 
because its conjugate acid is an electrophilic carbocation, which 
means that its formation will naturally favor a product following 
the rules of carbocation stability. Hyperconjugation provided 
by additional alkyl groups around the carbocation provide extra 
stability, making carbocations of higher substitution more stable. 
‚Ä¢ 
So, given the choice between a primary and secondary carbocation, 
SURSHQH ZLOO FKRRVH WR EHFRPH WKH ODWWHU ,Q D VHFRQG VWHS WKH
tables have turned, and the propenyl cation is attacked in turn by the 
somewhat nucleophilic chloride ion to produce 2-chloropropane.

96
Lecture 13: Addition Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
Further evidence of this mechanism is evident in the stereochemistry 
of this class of reactions. When addition of a hydrogen halide 
produces chiral centers in a new product, all possible stereoisomers 
are formed equally, forming a racemic mixture. The reason for this 
is the same as that for racemization in SN1 reactions‚Äîthat a planar

rearrangement products to form during hydrohalogenation. 
‚Ä¢ 
Although Markovnikov‚Äôs rules originally were focused on addition 
of hydrogen halides like hydrochloric acid, they are remarkably 
consistent when applied to many more reactions. 
Hydrohalogenation of Alkynes
‚Ä¢ 
A very similar chemistry takes place in the case of hydrohalogenation 
RIDON\QHVZKLFKFDQEHK\GURKDORJHQDWHGHLWKHURQFHRUWZLFH,Q
WKLVFDVHWKHPDMRUGLIIHUHQFHLVWKDWWRFRPSOHWHWKH¬øUVWDGGLWLRQ
ZRXOGUHTXLUHWKHIRUPDWLRQRIDYLQ\OFDWLRQ,WLVGLI¬øFXOWWRVD\LI
this is in fact how the reaction proceeds, but what is undeniable is 
that it proceeds much more slowly than does hydrohalogenation of 
an alkene.
‚Ä¢ 
Nonetheless, it can be achieved, creating what we call a vinyl halide 
in accordance with Markovnikov‚Äôs rule. Of course, in the presence 
of excess hydrogen halide, this is of little consequence because any 
stereochemistry will be wiped out when a carbocation does form in 
the second hydrohalogenation.
‚Ä¢ 
When this takes place, Markovnikov‚Äôs rule holds yet again, but even 
in situations involving equally substituted sp2 carbons, the halogen 
will end up on the same carbon atom as its predecessor. This is 
because the attached halogen atom stabilizes the carbocation by 
resonance on its way to becoming what we call a geminal dihalide. 
‚ÄúGeminal,‚Äù meaning ‚Äútwins,‚Äù implies that the two halogens are 

97
on the same carbon. The alternate possibility‚Äîcalled a ‚Äúvicinal‚Äù 
dihalide, from the Latin word for ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù‚Äîindicates that the 
halogen atoms are on adjacent carbons and does not form in this 
type of reaction.
Addition of Halogens to Alkenes
‚Ä¢ 
Another commonly used addition reaction is the addition of 
molecular chlorine, bromine, or iodine to alkenes. Unlike radical 
halogenation of alkanes, we don‚Äôt have to resort to extremes 
like photoactivated radical chemistry to halogenate alkenes and 
alkynes. This reaction is typically accomplished using molecular 
halogens like chlorine or bromine in a non-nucleophilic solvent like 
dichloromethane. When these reagents are combined, one halogen 
atom is added at each side of the double bond.
‚Ä¢ 
Chlorine, bromine, and iodine all have fairly large electron clouds, 
meaning that their valence electrons are not held very tightly by the 
nucleus. This makes it relatively easy for other charged species (like 
attacking pi electrons) to induce a dipole in the halogen molecule 
by electrostatic repulsion of its electron cloud.
‚Ä¢ 
Once this attack begins, the polarization continues until the halogen-
halogen bond is broken, producing a halide ion as a by-product. 
But the truly intriguing product of this step of the reaction is what 
EHFRPHVRIWKHDONHQH7KH¬øUVWVWHSRIWKLVUHDFWLRQLQYROYHVQRW
the addition of a hydrogen, but that of a much larger halogen atom 
to the carbon scaffold offered by the alkene.
‚Ä¢ 
Unlike hydrogen, large halogen atoms need not remain locally 
bonded to a single carbon, but rather, they can sit between the two 
alkene carbons, creating a cyclic halonium ion. The formation of 
this ion is driven energetically by the distribution of the positive 
charge among three atoms, rather than isolating it on a carbon, as in 
a traditional carbocation.

98
Lecture 13: Addition Reactions
‚Ä¢ 
The reaction completes when a chloride ion, for example, attacks 
the halonium ion, alleviating the positive charge completely and 
producing a vicinal dihalide. The attack can come from any halide 
ion in the mix.
‚Ä¢ 
During hydrohalogenation, a planar carbocation intermediate 
ensures that we will produce an equal mixture of all potential 
stereoisomers in such a reaction. But the halonium intermediate of 
WKHKDORJHQDWLRQUHDFWLRQLVQRWSODQDU,QIDFWLWLVTXLWHIDUIURPLW

the second from attacking from the same side. Attack can only take 
place from the opposing face of the intermediate. Because addition 
must take place on opposite sides of the plane of the molecule, we 
call this an ‚Äúanti‚Äù addition.
‚Ä¢ 
The consequences of this anti addition become more important 
when we consider halogenation using a more complex alkene. 
Because the starting material is planar, the chloronium ion can form 
from either side.
Halogenation of Alkynes

forming an alkene with two halogens trans to one another because 
of the anti addition, followed by a second halogenation to form a 
tetra-halogenated alkane. When the product of a single halogenation 
is desired, carefully controlling the amount of halogen added is all 
that is required.
‚Ä¢ 
Adding just one molar equivalent of halogen will produce the 
1,2-dihaloalkene almost exclusively. This works because the 
resulting 1,2-dihaloalkene has two electronegative halogen atoms 
attached, withdrawing electron density from the pi bond, making it 
less nucleophilic and, therefore, much less reactive than the alkyne 
starting material. So, we do not expect the second halogen addition 
to take place until all of the starting alkyne has been consumed.

‚Ä¢ 
Boyce and Sabatier were after a process that would convert less 
saturated (and less expensive) plant oils into molecules more 
closely resembling animal fats. This is because animal fats have 
a higher degree of saturation, making them solids near room 
temperature and increasing their shelf life. Because animal fats are 
more expensive, converting a cheaper source into a similar material 
was good business. 
‚Ä¢ 
Their success in this endeavor led to the production of partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils, which we are so accustomed to seeing 
listed on the back of food packages today. The double bonds of 
hydrocarbons can be saturated using molecular hydrogen at or near 
room temperature. But, importantly, the reaction is painfully slow. 
‚Ä¢ 
Boyce and Sabatier realized that the solution to this was the use of 
a catalyst to weaken the bond in the hydrogen molecule, thereby 
promoting the reaction without the need for excessive temperatures. 
The discovery of a method to make

Unfortunately, these catalysts are

uses 
heterogeneous catalysts, meaning 
that the catalyst itself is a solid,

‚Ä¢ 
Even though the metal catalyst is 
not consumed in the reaction, a 
mass of precious metal would cost 
a great deal and only have a small 
exposed surface area on which 
the chemistry can take place. This 
potentially prohibitive cost issue is 
often circumvented by producing the catalyst not as a pure material, 
but as a thin veneer of the precious metal adhered to a highly 
porous carbon support. This tremendously increases the amount of 
surface area which can be generated per gram of catalyst, making 
the process much more useful.

This challenge was of particular interest to Swiss chemist 
Herbert Lindlar, who published his work on selective catalytic 
hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes in 1952. He succeeded in 
creating a palladium catalyst that had been deliberately poisoned 
with (among other things) lead. This intentional contamination of 
the catalyst reduced its catalytic power to the extent that it could 
only facilitate a single syn hydrogenation, leading to conversion of 
alkynes to cis alkenes.

hydrogenation earned him a 
Nobel Prize.

Acidity and Boiling Points
‚Ä¢ 
Alcohols are great hydrogen bonders, because the hydroxyl group 
is capable of both donating and accepting electrons to form such an 
interaction. This means that alcohol molecules stick to one another 
much better than analogous hydrocarbons.
‚Ä¢ 
The presence of a hydrogen atom bonded to a heteroatom means 
that alcohols are also amphoteric, being capable of releasing the 
hydroxyl hydrogen as a proton, forming a species known as an 
alkoxide, or accepting a proton to form what we call an oxonium

aliphatic alcohols to remain neutral.
Synthesis of Alcohols
‚Ä¢ 
Alcohols are used widely in organic chemistry as both reagents 
and solvents. Most of the world‚Äôs ethanol is prepared by 
the fermentation of sugars by the bacterium Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, or yeast. This little organic chemist is without equal 
when it comes to creating ethanol, but what about other, more  
complex alcohols?

105
‚Ä¢ 
When larger, more complex alcohols are needed, we must often 
turn to the tools of organic chemistry to create them. There are 
many ways in which to do this. For example, they can be produced 
by nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides using hydroxide ions. 
But there are many, many more ways. 
‚Ä¢ 
We will now focus on how alcohols are produced using alkenes as 
the starting materials by the addition mechanism. To accomplish 
this, we will discuss three types of reactions: hydration of alkenes, 
a technique called oxymercuration-demercuration, and a technique 
known as hydroboration-oxidation. Each of these reactions has 
VSHFL¬øF DGYDQWDJHV DQG FKDOOHQJHV DVVRFLDWHG ZLWK WKHP DQG LQ
many cases, they will produce various structural isomers of the 
product alcohol.
‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs begin with a special kind of addition reaction: acid-catalyzed 
hydration of a very simple alkene, propene. As the name implies, 
we will need three ingredients: an alkene, a mineral acid, and water. 
,QRUGHUWRFRPSOHWHWKHUHDFWLRQZH¬∂OOQHHGWRDFLGLI\WKHVDPSOH
using an aqueous solution of mineral acid with a non-nucleophilic 
conjugate base‚Äîsomething like phosphoric or sulfuric acid.
‚Ä¢ 
A strong acid like sulfuric acid protonates the alkene, but there 
are two possible carbocations that might form: a primary propyl 
cation or a secondary isopropyl cation. Hyperconjugation causes 
the secondary carbocation to be strongly favored. This is one of the 
driving forces behind Markovnikov‚Äôs rule, and this reaction will be 
no exception.
‚Ä¢ 
,IZHIROORZWKHUHDFWLRQZLWKWKHLVRSURS\OFDWLRQWRFRPSOHWLRQ
we see that our acid selection has produced a non-nucleophilic base, 
leaving only water to act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbocation 
and forming a new bond. So, we have created a species known as 
an oxonium ion.

106
Lecture 14: Alcohols and Ethers
‚Ä¢ 
Oxonium ions are very acidic and quickly lose their acidic proton 
to a molecule of solvent or to another alkene, thus perpetuating 
WKHUHDFWLRQ,IZHHYDOXDWHWKHSURGXFWREWDLQHGZHVHHWKDWWKH
extension of Markovnikov‚Äôs rule has held, with the added hydrogen 
on the less-substituted carbon of the product and the hydroxyl 
group on the more-substituted carbon.
‚Ä¢ 
So, if the goal of our synthesis is to convert an alkene into an 
alcohol without stereoselectivity and obeying Markovnikov‚Äôs rule, 
acid-catalyzed hydration seems to be the ticket. But just as with 
all reactions involving carbocations, we have to be vigilant of the 
possibility for rearrangements in the intermediate. 
‚Ä¢ 
For example, what happens when we try to hydrate 3-methyl-1-
butene with aqueous sulfuric acid, ostensibly to form 3-methyl-2-
butanol? Protonation of the alkene leads to a secondary carbocation, 
but there is an adjacent tertiary carbon. This spells trouble, because 
a hydride shift can lead to formation of a more stable tertiary 
carbocation in the intermediate. This leads to a rearrangement 
product: 2-methyl-2-butanol.
‚Ä¢ 
So, how do we cope with this problem? This question no doubt 
vexed Markovnikov and was taken up by Karl Andreas Hofmann 
and Julius Sand in 1900. They were investigating the phenomenon 
that metals, though rare in organic chemistry, are present and can 
form bonds to carbon.
‚Ä¢ 
The reaction that Hofmann and Sand developed involves the use of 
mercuric acetate‚Äîa compound consisting of one atom of mercury 
bonded to two acetate groups. Hofmann and Sand realized that 
if this compound was used in place of a mineral acid to initiate 
hydration of an alkene, no rearrangement took place.
‚Ä¢ 
What if it were necessary to hydrate an alkene to produce the 
anti-Markovnikov product? American chemist Herbert C. Brown

107
‚Ä¢ 
What makes boron hydrides so interesting is that boron has a very 
low electronegativity‚Äîso low, in fact, that the hydrogen atoms of 
boron trihydride are at the negative end of the bond dipole. The 
unusual orientation of the bond dipole in boron trihydride causes it 
to interact with the pi system of the alkene in such a way that the 
hydrogen preferentially positions itself above the more-substituted 
carbon. More-substituted carbons tolerate positive charges better, 
and this is exactly what happens as a result of the nearby hydride. 
‚Ä¢ 
At this point, a single, concerted step breaks the boron-hydrogen 
bond, producing what is called an alkylborane. Because of 
this arrangement of atoms in the transition state, it is clear that 
hydroboration must take place with syn stereochemistry. 
‚Ä¢ 
Finally, the borane group is reacted with hydroxide and hydrogen 
peroxide to replace the borane with a hydroxyl group. So, the 
hydroboration and oxidation of our alcohol leads to an anti-
Markovnikov hydration of an alkene to an alcohol with syn 
stereochemistry.

as solvents than as reagents, but they are critical materials 
nonetheless.
‚Ä¢ 
Ethers can be synthesized using analogues of two of the complex 
mechanisms while simply substituting the desired alkyl group for 
the appropriate hydrogen. For example, instead of acid-catalyzed 
hydration to form 2-methyl-2-butanol, we can simply replace 
water with an alcohol, leading to the corresponding sec-butyl 
ether. Similarly, oxymercuration and demercuration in an alcohol 
solvent rather than water leads to a Markovnikov ether product  
without rearrangement.

108
Lecture 14: Alcohols and Ethers
‚Ä¢ 
Unfortunately, the complexities of the oxidation step in 
hydroboration and oxidation make it impossible to produce 
ethers from alkenes using this method, but there is a solution to  
this problem. 
Reactions of Alcohols
‚Ä¢ 
Although alcohols, and particularly ethers, are most frequently 
used as solvents in organic chemistry, there are situations in which 
alcohols can be reactants. The difference in the utility of these 
chemical cousins lies in their most obvious difference: the presence 
of an acidic hydrogen. Most simple aliphatic alcohols have a 
pKa of about 16. This makes them very weakly acidic, but acidic 
nonetheless. So, in the presence of a suitably basic environment, 
alcohols can be deprotonated to form their conjugate bases 
called alkoxides. 
‚Ä¢ 
Organic chemists sometimes use a reagent known as sodium 
hydride to accomplish this. This is a great technique because not 
only is it already so strongly favored, but the effervescence of the 
hydrogen gas by-product also makes the reaction truly irreversible, 
because the hydrogen gas just bubbles away.
‚Ä¢ 
Just as deprotonation of water forms the more nucleophilic 
hydroxide ion, deprotonation of the alcohol increases its 
nucleophilicity substantially by producing alkoxide ions. This 
nucleophile, mixed with the appropriate alkyl halide, can produce 
an ether through a process known as the Williamson ether synthesis: 
an SN2 reaction.
‚Ä¢ 
Because Williamson ether syntheses are SN2, a methyl or primary 
alkyl halide is expected to react well to form a new ether and a halide 
LRQE\SURGXFW6RUHDFWLQJHWKDQRO¬øUVWZLWKVRGLXPK\GULGHDQG
then with 1-chloro-3-methylbutane is a suitable route to our ether of 
lowest substitution. Unfortunately, highly substituted substrates are 
less likely to be effective, instead producing elimination products 
with double or triple bonds.

109
Substitution Reactions of Alcohols
‚Ä¢ 
But remember that alcohols are amphoteric, meaning that they can 
also accept a proton to become a conjugate acid. Protonation of an 
alcohol under very acidic conditions changes what would be a poor 
hydroxide leaving group into a much more stable water leaving 
group. What was the nucleophile in basic solution is instead the 
substrate under acidic conditions.

the neurotoxic effects of ethanol and prepare it for removal from 
the body, an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase converts 
the offending intoxicant into a more oxidized state‚Äîthat of 
acetaldehyde.
‚Ä¢ 
The process of enzymatic oxidation is complex and involves the 
assistance of large, complicated biomolecules, but it essentially 
consists of removal of the hydroxyl proton and one of its neighbors, 
thereby producing a double bond between the carbon and oxygen. 
‚Ä¢ 
Essentially, this is an oxidative elimination reaction. We call 
it oxidation because the central carbon is gaining additional 
attachment to oxygen atoms‚Äîin this case, trading a single bond to 
oxygen for a double bond. 

111
‚Ä¢ 
The product aldehyde is eventually metabolized further as 
this process continues, but in the meantime, it interferes with 
mitochondrial activity, liver function, and a host of other biological 
mechanisms, contributing to the condition that we colloquially refer 
to as a hangover.

that chromic acid itself does not: alpha protons. One of those alpha

Lecture 15: Aldehydes and Ketones
‚Ä¢ 
So, this mechanism depends on the presence of an alpha hydrogen 
on the starting material. A secondary alcohol has only one of these. 
So, this oxidation can only take place once, ending at the ketone 
stage in which the carbonyl carbon has no more hydrogens to  
give up.

leading not to the desired aldehyde, but rather to a more oxidized 
compound called a carboxylic acid. For now, our goal is to make 
an aldehyde, so how do we stop the oxidation at the desired point?
‚Ä¢ 
The key to stopping the oxidation selectively at the aldehyde stage 
is in remembering that aldehydes in aqueous solution tend to form 
UHDFWLYHK\GUDWHVFDOOHGJHPLQDOGLROV¬≥JHP¬¥GLROVIRUVKRUW,WLV
these geminal diols that can form a new chromate ester and undergo 
additional oxidation by chromic acid to form the carboxylic acid.
‚Ä¢ 
So, if we want to stop the oxidation at the aldehyde stage, we have 
to stop this gem diol from forming. As you might expect, the easiest 
way to avoid hydration of anything is to not have water around. 
But removing water poses a second problem: Chromic acid is not 
VLJQL¬øFDQWO\VROXEOHLQPRVWRUJDQLFVROYHQWV
‚Ä¢ 
So, to achieve our goal, we have to substitute a different 
oxidizing agent that is soluble in an organic solvent. Pyridinium 
chlorochromate (PCC) is one reagent that proves very useful in the 
oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes in particular, because of 
its solubility in solvents like methylene chloride.
‚Ä¢ 
This reaction of primary alcohols with PCC in organic solvents 
is the organic chemistry equivalent of the biological effects of

Antabuse. Antabuse is often prescribed to discourage alcohol

aldehyde dehydrogenase‚Äîthat enzyme that continues the process 
of oxidatively breaking down the alcohol metabolite acetaldehyde 
into the more manageable, and far less toxic, acetic acid.

113
‚Ä¢ 
Antabuse binds to and shuts down enzymes in the liver that further 
oxidize acetaldehyde and move it along in the natural process of 
removal. Stopping the oxidation process for ethanol at the aldehyde 
step like this causes an unusually high level of acetaldehyde to 
build up in the patient‚Äôs bloodstream. This in turn causes what is 
best described as a super hangover. 
‚Ä¢ 
PCC simply accomplishes the same effect on the lab bench. 
The difference is that it does so by preventing aldehyde hydrate 
formation instead of enzyme inhibition, and it can be done not only 
for ethanol, but also for practically any primary alcohol starting 
material we can imagine.

‚Ä¢ 
Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyls leads to an addition product 
in which hydrogen gas is added across the carbonyl double bond. 
To do this, we use a special catalyst called Raney nickel to form the 
corresponding alcohol. Raney nickel is a specially prepared, highly 
porous nickel-aluminum alloy that has a tremendous surface area 
and catalytic activity for hydrogenation. This catalyst was invented 
in 1926 by American engineer Murray Raney and is so effective 
that it is still in use industrially today.

The mechanism is completely analogous to hydrogenation of

hydrogenation of vegetable oils, just like Sabatier and Boyce‚Äôs

‚Ä¢ 
This method is often chosen in industrial settings, where gas-
handling equipment is available and inexpensive hydrogen gas 
offsets the cost of this equipment. But in the laboratory, where we 
usually want to perform reactions on a smaller scale, we often turn 
to the use of hydride reagents.

simply removes a proton from the solvent to become the neutral 
alcohol product.
Reactions of Ketones and Aldehydes in Acidic or Basic Environments
‚Ä¢ 
Just as with alcohols, aldehydes and ketones are amphiprotic, 
so we must consider the possibility that ketones and aldehydes 
might act as nucleophiles or electrophiles, depending on their pH 
environment. Just like alcohols, compounds containing carbonyl 
groups are prone to reactions under conditions of extreme pH‚Äî
either high or low. 
‚Ä¢ 
Basifying and acidifying are both viable strategies for activating 
ketones and aldehydes, inducing them to react. No reaction is 
a better example of this than the aldol condensation, a reaction 
between two carbonyl compounds that can be conducted under

chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz in 1872. What Wurtz didn‚Äôt know, 
but we know today, is that the reaction of one ethanal with another 
takes place when a portion of the sample becomes protonated at 
the carbonyl oxygen. So, a mixture of both neutral aldehyde and 
protonated aldehyde needs to be present.
‚Ä¢ 
The protonated aldehyde has a resonance contributor with positive 
charge density at the carbonyl carbon, and the neutral aldehyde can 
tautomerize to form a species known as an enol (for the alkene and 
alcohol motifs that combine to make it up).

a new alcohol group forms. The enol then quickly deprotonates to

however, before it was realized that the same result could be 
accomplished by instead increasing the nucleophilicity of a portion 
of the aldehyde by addition of a suitable base.
‚Ä¢ 
Addition of a base like hydroxide or methoxide can cause a portion 
of ethanal to become deprotonated at its alpha carbon, which can 
participate in resonance to form a resonance-stabilized enolate. One 
of the resonance contributors to this compound has negative charge 
density at the alpha carbon, making it a nucleophile.
‚Ä¢ 
So, the enolate nucleophile, best represented by the contributor 
with the negative charge on the alpha carbon, attacks a neutral, but 
electrophilic carbonyl carbon, breaking its pi bond and promoting 
a series of steps that lead to the same product as in Wurtz‚Äôs  
acidic reaction.
Acetals and Ketals
‚Ä¢ 
Carbonyl-containing compounds don‚Äôt just react with themselves. 
They make great electrophiles for attack by a large library of 
nucleophiles. Another commonly used reaction employing ketones 
and aldehydes as electrophiles is their reactions with alcohols. 
When we do this, we get compounds reminiscent of hydrates like 
methylene glycol, but one or both of the OH hydrogens is replaced 
with an alkyl group. 
‚Ä¢ 
,QWKHFDVHRIDQDOGHK\GHOLNHIRUPDOGHK\GHUHSODFHPHQWRIRQH
OH leads to what we call a hemiacetal, while replacement of both 
give us an acetal. 

116
Lecture 15: Aldehydes and Ketones
‚Ä¢ 
When the carbon bearing the two groups was instead derived from 
a ketone (having two R groups), we call the resulting compounds 
hemiketals and ketals. 
‚Ä¢ 
The formation of hemiacetals and hemiketals from aldehydes and 
ketones is accomplished in exactly the same way that their hydrates 
are made, but we simply substitute an alkoxide in place of the 
hydroxide nucleophile. After one nucleophilic attack has taken 
place, there is no good leaving group to depart and make room for 
a second attack. Therefore, the reaction stops at the hemiacetal or 
hemiketal stage.
‚Ä¢ 
We can instead create acetals and ketals by mixing aldehydes 
and ketones with an alcohol under acidic conditions. Under these 
conditions, the carbonyl group can be protonated, making it a good 
HOHFWURSKLOH,WLVWKHQDWWDFNHGE\WKHZHDNO\QXFOHRSKLOLFDOFRKRO
through an SN1 reaction. This forms a protonated ether that quickly 
loses its proton to solvent.
‚Ä¢ 
But under acidic conditions, a second attack is possible, because 
the hemiacetal or hemiketal formed can be protonated to create 
an oxonium ion in which a water leaving group can be displaced 
by another alcohol nucleophile. This leads to the acetal or ketal, 
depending on whether the starting material was an aldehyde or a 
ketone, respectively.
‚Ä¢ 
Both acetals and ketals are very stable to strong bases and 
nucleophiles, but they can be easily converted back into their 
ketone or aldehyde counterpart using acidic hydrolysis, essentially 
reversing the reaction by adding water. These characteristics make 
acetals and ketals useful as protecting groups in synthesis, masking 
reactive carbonyl sites that can be unmasked later after chemically 
modifying other regions of a molecule.

the carboxylic acid group‚Äôs location is unnecessary because it is 
incapable of extending a chain, instead always terminating a chain.
‚Ä¢ 
Replacing the acidic hydrogen of a carboxylic acid with an R group 
has three profound effects on esters. First, they are not remotely as 
acidic as their predecessors. Second, their functional group polarity 
is much lower. Finally, the fact that they can only accept hydrogen 
bonds, not donate to them, makes them more volatile and less water 
soluble than carboxylic acids of similar size.

Neutral carboxylic acids contain both an sp2 oxygen from the 
carbonyl and an sp3 oxygen as a hydroxyl. The dual nature of the 
oxygen atoms in this motif makes acids excellent at hydrogen 
bonding to themselves, giving them relatively high boiling points.

solubility when their carbon frameworks are relatively small.
‚Ä¢ 
Perhaps what sets organic acids apart from analogous alcohols and 
aldehydes is their higher acidity. The key to this elevated acidity is 
the way the two oxygen atoms work in concert to offer resonance 
and stabilize the conjugate base that forms when the acidic 
proton is removed. We call this deprotonated carboxylic acid a  
carboxylate ion. 
‚Ä¢ 
Removal of a proton from a carboxylic acid produces an anion with 
two identical resonance contributors, both of which place some of 
the negative charge on an electronegative oxygen atom.
Synthesis of Carboxylic Acids
‚Ä¢ 
Carboxylic acids are the end of the line as oxidation of primary 
alcohols goes. They can be produced using our now-familiar 
aqueous chromic acid reaction in which one round of oxidation 
produces an aldehyde, followed by hydration and a second round 
of oxidation. So, when treated with aqueous chromic acid, ethanol 
oxidizes to ethanal, which becomes ethanoic acid, or acetic acid.

121
‚Ä¢ 
But carboxylic acids need not be created from oxygen-containing 
starting materials. Certain alkenes can also be oxidized to form acids 
using a suitable oxidizing agent as well. Consider, for example, 
2-butene, which can be reacted with potassium permanganate under 
acidic conditions to produce two molecules of acetic acid.
‚Ä¢ 
This reaction takes place through an intermediate that we would 
call a vicinal diol. This vicinal diol quickly splits under acidic

chemists of the late 1800s, and his work on carbohydrates gave us 
the Fischer projection. Far from being just a carbohydrate chemist, 
Fischer was driven to synthesize many of the small biologically 
relevant molecules that we encounter on an almost daily basis, 
including caffeine and the theobromine found in chocolate. He also

‚Ä¢ 
This attack forms a tetrahedral intermediate that can take on two

easily accomplished even in ancient times by allowing rainwater to 
percolate through wood ashes to create lye, which modern chemists

‚Ä¢ 
The hydroxide from lye is a much better nucleophile than 
water and attacks the carbonyl of neutral esters easily to form a 
tetrahedral intermediate. Just as with the acid mechanism, this 
intermediate is now faced with two options: losing a hydroxide to 
go back to starting materials or losing an alkoxide as it recovers its  
carbonyl bond.

other atoms. This makes nitrogen quite an interesting structural 
twist, because unlike oxygen, in its sp3-hybridized state, it can 
perpetuate chains and also bear one additional functional group  
or substituent.
‚Ä¢ 
The library of nitrogen-containing motifs can get unwieldy very 
quickly, so we‚Äôll focus on just the simplest of these groups‚Äî
those consisting of only one nitrogen atom bonded to one or more 
hydrocarbons. Within this narrow group of compounds, nitrogen 
can take on an sp3-hybridized state, forming three single bonds to

take on an sp2 hybridization state, making a double and a single 
bond, forming an imine, or it can be sp, creating just one triple 
bond, commonly called a nitrile.

127
‚Ä¢ 
This means that the family of simple nitrogen-containing 
compounds is larger and more complex than oxygen. We now have 
to consider not just how our heteroatom can terminate or perpetuate 
a chain, but also how it can modify that chain, introducing 
branching in ways that oxygen simply can‚Äôt. 
Structure and Nomenclature of Amines, Imines, and Nitriles
‚Ä¢ 
Aliphatic amines can be thought of as saturated hydrocarbons 
containing at least one bonded sp3 nitrogen atom. Just as oxygen 
had two bonding partners, nitrogen will have three, meaning that it 
may be bonded to just one alkyl group, creating a primary amine; 
two alkyl groups, creating a secondary amine; or three alkyl groups, 
producing a tertiary amine. 
‚Ä¢ 
Amines can be thought of as cousins to alcohols and ethers in which 
an NR group has been substituted instead of an OR. Alkylamines 
are somewhat less reactive than their alcohol brethren, leading 
to their frequent use as weak bases in reactions involving more 
reactive starting materials. The pKa of a protonated alkylamine (or 
alkylammonium ion) is about 11. This makes them suitable bases 
for the removal of protons from species like carboxylic acids, 
phenols, and others.

for oxygen-containing compounds, owing to the branched nature 
of the sp3 nitrogen. Amine motifs are treated as functional groups,

Synthesis of Amines
‚Ä¢ 
When it comes to organic synthesis, the human race has been bested 
time and time again by single-celled organisms. Just as was the 
case with synthesis of acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and other oxygen-
containing compounds, it would seem that the extra 3 billion years

‚Ä¢ 
Amines are the simplest starting point from which Haber-Bosch 
ammonia (named for Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch) can be injected 
into the organic chemistry realm. One very simple example of this 
is direct alkylation of ammonia using alkyl chlorides.
‚Ä¢ 
Ammonia is a fairly good nucleophile, and it can be coerced to 
react by an SN2 reaction with a primary or methyl alkyl halide like 
ethyl chloride.
‚Ä¢ 
When mixed, a nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place, 
generating a primary amine and one mole of hydrochloric acid. So, 
here we run into a potential problem. The product amine is also 
nucleophilic and, in theory, can react with yet another alkyl halide 
to form a secondary amine, which could again react to form a 
tertiary alkyl halide.
‚Ä¢ 
So, it is rather easy to make a tertiary alkyl amine by direct 
alkylation‚Äîjust use a large excess of alkyl halide. Conversely, 
we can force the reaction system in the direction of primary alkyl 
halides by using a large excess of ammonia, limiting the chances 
that an already-formed primary amine will productively collide 
with another alkyl halide before they are all consumed. 
‚Ä¢ 
But this requires a very large excess of ammonia. The solution to 
this problem in making primary amines was actually worked out 
well ahead of Haber‚Äôs time by one of his countrymen, Siegmund 
Gabriel, who used what we commonly refer to as a protecting group 
to temporarily render two sites on ammonia unreactive and then 
restore them to their original state after alkylation.

129
‚Ä¢ 
Gabriel used a compound called phthalimide in place of ammonia, 
activating it with potassium hydroxide to create a more nucleophilic 
phthalimide ion. This ion attacks the alkyl halide to form the N-alkyl 
phthalimide intermediate. But there are no more NH protons to 
lose, which is a requirement for the reaction to proceed.
‚Ä¢ 
After this step, a molecule known as hydrazine is used to remove the 
protecting group. Hydrazine contains two potentially nucleophilic 
nitrogens, and the phthalimide motif has two electrophilic carbonyl 
FDUERQV7KHK\GUD]LQH¬øUVWDWWDFNVRQHFDUERQ\ODQGWKHQWKHQH[W
forming the very stable by-product phthalimide hydrazide and our 
primary amine.
‚Ä¢ 
Direct alkylation is an easy way to make tertiary amines, and 
primary amines can be made using phthalimide protecting groups 
and the Gabriel synthesis. But what about secondary amines? They 
cannot be favored by stoichiometric control, nor can the Gabriel

Under these conditions, an N-substituted imine is formed. Once

carbonyl that uses one of the amine protons to tautomerize to a 
b-hydroxyamine. Finally, a second tautomerism occurs, leading to 
departure of a water molecule and formation of the imine.
‚Ä¢ 
Of course, imines can always be reduced to their analogous amines 
using lithium aluminum hydride or palladium and carbon. Just 
as with creating a secondary amine, a linear primary amine can 
be made by reduction of a primary aldimine. Branched primary 
amines can be prepared by reduction of primary ketimines. 
Linear secondary amines can be prepared from secondary 
aldimines, and branched secondary amines can be prepared from  
secondary ketimines.
‚Ä¢ 
But imines are so much more than just intermediates in the synthesis 
of amines. They hold their own as a commercially useful class of

functional group we have yet examined can accomplish: They can 
be used to connect two large pi systems together through resonance. 
Of all the motifs we have considered so far, imines are the only 
heteroatom motif that has the ability to perpetuate the overlap of pi 
orbitals from one side of the functional group to the other.
‚Ä¢ 
A perfect example of this motif‚Äôs occurrence in commercial 
products is their presence in dyestuffs. Phenazine, for example, 
contains two of these groups. They link the two neighboring 
rings by resonance, creating a huge volume through which the pi 
electrons can move. Phenazine serves as the backbone for a number 
of commercial stains and dyes. 

131
Structure and Nomenclature of Nitriles
‚Ä¢ 
Nitriles, the simplest compounds containing an sp nitrogen, have 
a terminal nitrogen triple-bonded to a carbon, the most simple of 
these probably being the most well known: hydrocyanic acid, better 
known as hydrogen cyanide, the gas commonly used in executions 
decades ago.
‚Ä¢ 
Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid, and it dissociates partially 
in the bloodstream, creating protons and the cyanide ion. This 
small ion is a powerful binder to certain proteins involved in the 
electron transport chain that our bodies use to process energy and  
stay alive.
‚Ä¢ 
The cyanide ion is not only very toxic, but is also very nucleophilic, 
prompting many to brave this potentially lethal compound in 
pursuit of their chemical goals. For example, cyanide was, 
and in some cases still is, used as an agent to extract gold from  
low-grade ore. 
‚Ä¢ 
Cyanide and gold form a strong complex known as aurocyanide. 
This complex is far more water-soluble than gold itself; gold 
can be leached from rock using strong solutions of cyanide in 
water. Naturally, this process must be very carefully monitored 
and controlled, and its by-products must be thoroughly treated  
for disposal. 
‚Ä¢ 
We also use cyanide to produce much larger nitrile compounds 
from primary and secondary alkyl halides in a simple SN2 reaction. 
Using cyanide as a nucleophile, carbon chains can be conveniently 
extended by one carbon, creating larger nitriles. These nitriles have 
many uses, including an alternative to the Gabriel synthesis to 
manufacture primary amines without concern of over-substituting 
the product.

Lecture 17: Amines, Imines, and Nitriles
‚Ä¢ 
Having pi bonds to their heteroatoms means that nitriles can 
be thought of as being similar to carbonyls, just like their imine 
cousins. They have a very electrophilic nitrile carbon and are 
susceptible to nucleophilic attack at that location. So, we can design 
syntheses in which the electrophilic nitrile carbon is attacked, 
leading to strategies to create many other functional groups.
‚Ä¢ 
Probably the most familiar 
use of the term ‚Äúnitrile‚Äù is its 
reference to functional groups

nitric acid with alcohols. You also will explore nitro compounds and amino

is already present in the nitrate ester group, and you have a very 
explosive substance.

Compounds 
containing

trinitrotoluene (TNT).

One particularly useful application of the nitro group in synthesis 
is that it can be reduced to an amine functional group using the 
familiar hydrogen and metal catalyst developed by Sabatier, or 
acidic solutions of certain metals. This can be a very handy synthetic 
tool when an amine group is desired in a particular location on a 
product, but attachment of a nitro group is easier to accomplish.
TNT contains organic motifs 
that combine nitrogen and 
oxygen with organics to form an 
extremely reactive compound.

136
Lecture 18: Nitrates, Amino Acids, and Amides
‚Ä¢ 
A classic example of this utility is the synthesis of the anesthetic 
Novocain. The reaction requires the use of thionyl chloride to 
convert the carboxylic acid group to an acid chloride. A secondary 
amine is then reacted with that activated site to produce the needed 
tertiary amine.
‚Ä¢ 
The problem is that the amino group from the ring can also react 
with the activated acid chloride. The solution is to start with an 
unreactive nitro group, completing the tertiary amine formation 
before reducing the nitro group to the desired amine.
Amino Acids
‚Ä¢ 
We have examined nitrate esters and nitrates, both of which contain 
nitrogen-oxygen bonds, and‚Äînot so coincidentally‚Äîboth of 
which can be used to make high explosives. But there are other 
organics that contain both of these elements joined not directly to 
one another, but through one or more carbons. When we make this 
YHU\VPDOOVWUXFWXUDOFKDQJHZH¬øQGRXUVHOYHVPDNLQJPROHFXOHV
that have a very different but equally versatile chemistry and can be 
used safely and reliably in organic synthesis.
‚Ä¢ 
When a carboxylic acid motif is connected to an amine group via 
at least one intervening carbon, we call the resulting molecule an 
amino acid. Amino acids combine an acidic carboxylic acid group 
with a basic amine group, so they are often found in a state in which 
the acid is deprotonated but the amine is protonated. We call species 
like this‚Äîones with a positive and negative charge in separate 
regions‚Äîzwitterions.
‚Ä¢ 
The most famous group of amino acids is the 20 amino acids used 
by your body and all other living systems to produce proteins 
and enzymes that moderate your biochemistry. All of them share 
a common amino acid motif‚Äîone in which the two groups are 
separated by only one carbon. We call these alpha amino acids.

137
‚Ä¢ 
But amino acids can have more than one carbon separating their 
acid and base groups. Two carbons in between produces a beta 
amino acid. Three carbons in between leads to a gamma amino 
acid, the simplest of which is gamma aminobutyric acid, a powerful 
neurotransmitter and integral part of your central nervous system. 
Amides
‚Ä¢ 
Yet another pervasive motif in organic chemistry that contains 
oxygen and nitrogen is the amide functional group. You can think 
of an amide as a carboxylic acid or ester with an sp3 nitrogen, 
rather than an sp3 oxygen. The lower electronegativity of the amide

acids, with a pKa somewhere around 25 compared to 5 for a typical 
organic acid.
‚Ä¢ 
Primary amides have an NH2 group and can be synthesized from 
carboxylic acids by reaction with ammonia gas. A favorable proton 
transfer forms carboxylate and ammonium, which are heated to 
GULYHRIIWKHZDWHUE\SURGXFWRIWKHDPLGHERQGIRUPDWLRQ,WLV

ethanamide. Just as carboxylic acids are similar to esters, varying 
only by replacement of the acidic hydrogen with an R group, 
primary amides can be changed to secondary and tertiary amides in 
which one or both hydrogens are substituted with an R group.
‚Ä¢ 
When there are R groups present, we name them as substituents 
of the parent primary amide. Examples are N-methylethanamide 
and N,N-dimethylethanamide. You may see these names shortened 
by dropping the ‚ÄúN‚Äù designation and simply calling them 
methylethanamide and dimethylethanamide.

give us a useful alternative to the direct amination route to create 
amines. Amines can be synthesized easily when the R groups of the 
alkyl chloride substrate are primary or secondary. But an SN2 reaction 
is essentially impossible when the alkyl halide substrate is tertiary. 
‚Ä¢ 
So, we are left wondering how we might create something like 
t-butylamine, in which the amine nitrogen is attached to a tertiary 
FDUERQ ,I ZH ZHUH WR WU\ WR GLUHFW DPLQDWLRQ RI t-butyl bromide 
or t-butyl chloride, we expect a preponderance of the elimination 
product to form (if anything forms at all).
‚Ä¢ 
One solution to this problem is the Hofmann rearrangement, named 
for German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann. He discovered 
that primary amides could be converted into amines by reaction 
with a molecular halogen like chlorine or bromine and an aqueous 
base like sodium hydroxide solution. This reaction works even if 
the adjacent carbon is tertiary.
‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs go through this reaction using t-butyl amide, molecular 
bromine, and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Under these conditions, 
just a small amount of the amide is deprotonated, forming a 
nucleophilic species that attacks the bromine molecule. The 
important difference is that the R groups are already attached to the 
nucleophile, not the substrate, in the initiating event of the reaction.
‚Ä¢ 
This process forms an N-bromo amide, which is deprotonated a 
second time. Then, the bromide group is displaced from the amide 
nitrogen in an alkyl shift. This effectively reverses the carbon and 
nitrogen ordering in the chain, creating what we call an isocyanate.
‚Ä¢ 
Hydroxide ion then catalyzes the conversion of isocyanate to 
a motif known as a carbamic acid, which is essentially just a 
carboxylic acid bonded directly to a nitrogen, rather than a carbon. 
Carbamic acids have a strong tendency to decarboxylate under 
basic conditions, leading to an amine.

139
‚Ä¢ 
So, we have used the Hofmann rearrangement starting with 
t-butylamide to produce t-butylamine. About 30 years later, 
Theodore Curtis improved on this reaction using azide ion to 
convert an acyl chloride to acyl azide. This species reacts by a 
similar mechanism to form isocyanate, which decarboxylates to 
form an amine.
The Peptide Bond
‚Ä¢ 
Perhaps the most interesting chemistry involving amides is their 
use to link together dimers and short oligomers (meaning a chain 
of a few subunits) of amino acids to form some consumer goods

your gastrointestinal system, the amide bond is easily hydrolyzed to

‚Ä¢ 
The aspartic acid is of little concern, because it has no known 
ill effects on health. What is concerning to some is that the 
phenylalanine methyl ester also hydrolyzes into phenylalanine, to 
which a small percentage of the population is highly sensitive, and 
methanol, which is metabolized to formaldehyde, which can have 
toxic effects in the body, including blindness.

diet soda contains about 180 milligrams of aspartame, which is just 
about enough to produce 18 milligrams of methanol when it reaches

wine contains about 50 milligrams of methanol. A similar amount 
of methanol is also produced by hydrolysis of naturally occurring 
methyl esters in fruit juices.

140
Lecture 18: Nitrates, Amino Acids, and Amides
‚Ä¢ 
So, based on the numbers, you are no more likely to develop vision 
problems drinking diet soda than you are by drinking grape juice or 
beer. To reach acutely dangerous levels of methanol in your system 
would likely require a diet soda binge the likes of which the world 
has never seen before.

Conjugation and the Diels-Alder Reaction
Lecture 19
,
n this lecture, you will be introduced to the phenomenon of conjugation, 
in which multiple pi bonds in resonance with one another lend 
extra stability to a compound or ion. You will learn a few structural 
arguments for why this added stability exists, and you will discover a 
new way of modeling the energies of conjugated pi systems in alkenes.

exploring two reactions. Finally, you will examine a reaction conceived by 
Otto Diels and Kurt Alder that allows us to quickly and easily form two  
carbon-carbon bonds.
Conjugation
‚Ä¢ 
The simplest conjugated compound possible in organic chemistry 
is the hydrocarbon 1,3-butene. Compounds with pi bonds, or the 
potential to have them, tend to have resonance contributors that can 
stabilize those compounds; 1,3-butadiene is no different, having 
resonance contributors that contain pi electron density on the 
intervening carbon-carbon bond.
‚Ä¢ 
When this resonance involves the commingling of multiple 
pi bonds, as it does in this case, we refer to this special type of 
resonance as conjugation. Conjugation in a compound comes with 
some important structural, physical, and chemical properties.
‚Ä¢ 
The requirement for conjugation is that double bonds are

bond apart, then an intervening sp3 carbon prevents the pi electrons

‚Ä¢ 
For example, what is commonly called vinylethylene would be 
named 1,3-butadiene. Creating ever-larger linear conjugated 
alkenes produces 1,3,5-hexatriene, and then 1,3,5,7-octatetraene, 
etc. This analogy extends to cyclic conjugated compounds. For 
example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene would be a conjugated compound  
as well.
Stability of Conjugated Species
‚Ä¢ 
Just as we did with isolated alkenes, we can also survey the effect of 
conjugation on stability using heats of hydrogenation. Let‚Äôs do this 
using a simple system with only a few isomers, such as pentadienes. 
‚Ä¢ 
As a reference, the heat of hydrogenation of 1-pentene is 125

isolated from the other by multiple carbon-carbon bonds, we create 
1,4-pentadiene, which contains two isolated double bonds. Not 
surprisingly, the heat of hydrogenation doubles because we have 
essentially added a second bond of exactly the same type.
‚Ä¢ 
But hydrogenation of its regioisomer 1,3-pentadiene releases less

effect of resonance.
‚Ä¢ 
This stabilizing effect extends far beyond simple diene 
hydrocarbons. Resonance has similar effects on the stability of 
compounds containing heteroatoms, such as enols, carbocations, 
and many more.

143
Reactivity of Conjugated Alkenes
‚Ä¢ 
Although conjugated systems are somewhat more stable than 
similar but isolated pi systems, they can and do undergo many 
of the addition reactions that we discussed previously for simple, 
isolated alkenes‚Äîwith a few important caveats.
‚Ä¢ 
For example, the highly connected pi systems of conjugated 
compounds like alkenes mean that they can often undergo more 
complex addition reactions with unexpected regioisomers. The 
classic example of this is the addition of a hydrogen halide to 
1,3-butadiene.
‚Ä¢ 
Markovnikov‚Äôs rule states that the addition of hydrogen halides to 
alkenes will occur with the halide going to the more-substituted 
carbon. But what happens when that alkene is conjugated? 
‚Ä¢ 
,Q WKH UHDFWLRQ EHWZHHQ EXWDGLHQH DQG K\GURFKORULF DFLG WKH
pi electrons still attack the acidic hydrogen of hydrochloric acid, 
producing a secondary carbocation‚Äîbut the presence of an adjacent 
p orbital means that this carbocation is resonance stabilized, placing 
some of the positive charge density much farther away from the 
newly acquired proton than we are accustomed to seeing.
‚Ä¢ 
So, in the second step of our reaction, the chloride nucleophile 
now has a choice of where to react. The two potential results are 
the products of a 1,2 addition, which produces a terminal alkene 
in accordance with Markovnikov‚Äôs rule, and a 1,4 addition, which 
produces an internal alkene, the likes of which Zaitsev would be 
likely to predict. 
‚Ä¢ 
So, in a single system, we have a microcosm of this classic feud 
going on. The real winner is probably Zaitsev. The more stable 
product is, in fact, the internal alkene. But the catch is that 
Markovnikov‚Äôs product forms faster, because the nucleophilic 
attack by chloride in the second step has a lower activation energy 
barrier at the 2 position than at the 4 position.

144
Lecture 19: Conjugation and the Diels-Alder Reaction
‚Ä¢ 
So, if we run this reaction at very low temperatures for very short 
periods of time, we get more of the 1,2-addition product. This is 
because the competing process, 
the 1,4 addition, happens very 
slowly and doesn‚Äôt get a chance 
to take place. We call reactions 
run under conditions like this 
kinetically controlled reactions, 
and the corresponding product 
is called the kinetic product.
‚Ä¢ 
But if we give the system 
plenty of heat and lots of time, 
giving the 1,4-addition a chance 
to take place, then it will be 
the major product, because 
both pathways are accessible 
to the reagents, giving them 
a choice. We call reactions 
run like this, with long run 
times and high temperatures, 
thermodynamically controlled 
reactions.

145
‚Ä¢ 
The Diels-Alder reaction is actually one of a class of reactions 
known as pericyclic reactions, which consist of the exchange 
of multiple pi electrons simultaneously between two molecules 
to create new sigma bonds between them. The Diels-Alder is 
designated a [4+2]-pericyclic reaction because it involves such a 
reaction between a conjugated diene (having 4 pi electrons) and 
one pi bond from another reagent known as a dienophile (having  
2 pi electrons).
‚Ä¢ 
The simplest example that meets these criteria is the reaction 
between s-cis-1,3-butadiene and ethene. To envision how this 
reaction takes place, let‚Äôs re-create the molecular orbitals of both 
molecules. First, 1,3-butadiene has four molecular orbitals, of 
which the pi 2 is the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) 
DQGWKHSLLVWKHORZHVWXQ¬øOOHGPROHFXODURUELWDO/802
‚Ä¢ 
We collectively refer to the HOMO and LUMO as frontier 
molecular orbitals, because they usually represent the orbitals 
that will be vacated and occupied, respectively, when a reaction  
takes place.
‚Ä¢ 
Ethene is a bit simpler because it only has two p orbitals in its pi 
system. So, pi 1 is the HOMO and pi 2 is the LUMO.
‚Ä¢ 
As the two reagents approach one another, the HOMO of the diene 
and the LUMO of the dienophile are in phase on both sides, and the 
same is true of the diene LUMO and the dienophile HOMO. This

trading two pi bonds for two sigma bonds. The new carbon-carbon 
bond creation is complete. 

146
Lecture 19: Conjugation and the Diels-Alder Reaction
‚Ä¢ 
What makes the [4+2] reaction so easy to complete is the in-phase 
alignment of frontier molecular orbitals. Because the geometries 
of the molecular orbitals are perfectly set up for a reaction to take 
place, all we need is to mix the reagents and wait for the molecules 
to collide. We call this a thermally activated reaction.

the frontier molecular orbitals are not properly aligned when the

explanation until the 1860s, when August Kekule hypothesized 
that benzene‚Äôs formula and properties could be explained if the 
molecule were cyclic. 
‚Ä¢ 
We know today that Kekule was right. His theory was not beyond 
challenge, however, as Kekule‚Äôs model of a cyclic triene predicts 
that a molecule of benzene should have two different types of 
carbon-carbon bonds: three shorter double bonds and three longer 
single bonds. Yet the compound proved to have six identical bonds, 
forming a perfect hexagon.
‚Ä¢ 
Also, Kekule‚Äôs putative structure should generate two possible 
isomers when replacing two of the hydrogens with other groups, such 
as chlorine. One isomer has a double-bonded carbon between the 
substituents, and the other has only a single bond. Kekule attempted 
to explain this observation as a fast interconversion between the two 
putative isomers, but he was actually wrong about this.

‚Ä¢ 
But when we add that magical third pair of pi electrons, the heat 
of hydrogenation is far less than we would have expected‚Äîabout 
150 kilojoules per mole less. We call this discrepancy the resonance 
energy for benzene. To put the size of that resonance energy into 
perspective, it is just less than half the bond enthalpy of a covalent 
carbon-carbon bond.

atomic orbitals to combine to form one large pi system with density 
both above and below the ring.
‚Ä¢ 
But the rule for the formation of molecular orbitals is that six atomic 
orbitals in means six molecular orbitals out. These orbitals all 
correspond to the linear addition of p atomic orbitals with varying 
combinations of phase. For example, when all six p orbitals are in 
phase, the lowest possible energy molecular orbital is obtained. We 
call this the pi 1.

pi 3), two possibilities with two node planes (pi 4 and pi 5), and 
one possibility in which all six p orbitals are aligned antiparallel, 
creating three nodal planes and a sixth molecular orbital (pi 6).
‚Ä¢ 
So, we are in a situation very similar to that of 1,3,5-hexatriene,

‚Ä¢ 
Bisecting this ring with a horizontal line gives us the nonbonding 
energy for the diagram, and populating the pi system with the total 
inventory of six pi electrons from benzene leads us to a situation in 
which all of those electrons are in a more stable bonding molecular

electrons from its pi system, we see a situation similar to that of 
cyclobutadiene, in which the last two electrons are in nonbonding 
orbitals, making 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene anti-aromatic. 
‚Ä¢ 
This fact is evident in the structure of 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene, 
which has been shown to have four isolated double bonds of shorter 
length and a distinct pucker, which places alternating pi bonds out of 
alignment with one another in an attempt to avoid anti-aromaticity.

on. This trend‚Äîthat 4n pi electrons leads to anti-aromatic systems 
and 4n pi + 2 electrons leads to aromatic systems‚Äîis known as 
H√ºckel‚Äôs rule, named for German chemist Erich H√ºckel.
‚Ä¢ 
But the utility of H√ºckel‚Äôs rule extends well beyond just 
hydrocarbons like benzene; it can be used to explain the behavior 
of other cyclic systems with aligned p orbitals as well. For example, 
a polygon analysis of the tropylium ion, which is a carbocation 
consisting of a seven-membered ring with six pi electrons and a 
positive charge, shows that it is also aromatic.

benzoic acid.

dimethylbenzene, commonly called xylene, can form three 
different isomers: 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, and 
1,4-dimethylbenzene.

Large Polynuclear Aromatics
‚Ä¢ 
Aromatics need not exist as an isolated benzene ring. Although 
most, if not all, of the compounds we will be investigating will have 
isolated benzene motifs, a newer class of compounds has gathered 
considerable interest in recent decades.
‚Ä¢ 
Picture two benzene rings fused along one edge, essentially 
sharing a carbon-carbon bond. We call this compound naphthalene. 
By fusing the rings, we create two aromatic systems that share 
a common pair of p orbitals, so it should come as no surprise 
that naphthalene‚Äôs resonance energy is about 252 kilojoules 
per mole‚Äîslightly less than two separate benzene rings, but  
substantial nonetheless.

155

For planar compounds, this trend continues through the tricyclics 
anthracene and phenanthrene all the way up to graphite, which 
is essentially a never-ending sheet of fully fused benzene rings.

‚Äúbuckyballs‚Äù and named for the famous architect, inventor, and 
futurist R. Buckminster Fuller.
‚Ä¢ 
One can also envision how the buckyball motif could act as endcaps 
connecting a graphene sheet that is rolled up on itself. This structure 
is commonly called a carbon nanotube. These materials show some 
promise in some very exciting applications‚Äîsuch as gas storage, 
media, and building materials to electronics, engineering, and 
medicine‚Äîbut much of that potential is yet to be realized.

Baeyer was supervising a graduate student named Othmar Zeidler,

benzene compound known as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 
(DDT). Zeidler‚Äôs synthesis of this compound was accomplished 
using chlorobenzene and chloral under acidic conditions. Under 
these conditions, the two chlorobenzene rings are joined by 
substituting the chloral for hydrogens in the para position of  
each ring.

The synthesis of DDT is a shining 
example 
of 
an 
electrophilic 
aromatic 
substitution 
reaction, 
which is so named because the 
newly attached motif starts out as 
an electrophile (unlike nucleophilic 
substitution, in which the newly 
added group is nucleophilic). 
‚Ä¢ 
,Q WKH UHDFWLRQ RI EHQ]HQH DQG D
generic electrophile, for example, 
the pi electrons of benzene are 
not held as tightly as most sigma-
bonding electrons, even though 
they are in an aromatic system. 
Although it takes an extraordinarily 
electrophilic 
reagent 
to 
coax 
them 
into 
attacking, 
it 
can  
be accomplished. 
‚Ä¢ 
When an adequately electrophilic 
reagent is added to benzene, the 
pi electrons of benzene simply 
can‚Äôt resist attacking, and in doing so, they generate a tetrahedral 
center adjacent to a resonance-stabilized carbocation. We call this 
intermediate a sigma complex because we have traded two of our 
aromatic pi electrons to make a new sigma bond to the electrophile.
‚Ä¢ 
Even with the newly formed, more stable sigma bond, the sigma 
complex is of much higher energy than the starting material. This is 
mainly because the ring has lost its aromaticity, and the associated 
stability, at this point.
Though now banned in the 
United States, DDT is a shining 
example of an electrophilic 
aromatic substitution reaction.

159
‚Ä¢ 
Under conditions like this, the intermediate will immediately 
begin to look for ways to dispense with the positive charge of 
the carbocation and recover its aromaticity. The simplest way to 
remove the newly acquired positive charge is to lose a proton to  
the solvent.

cleavage, we can repopulate the aromatic ring using the bonding 
electrons that were holding that substituent in place. Removal of 
the electrophile would produce an uninteresting result, because 
we simply return to the starting materials. But what if instead we 
remove the proton on the same tetrahedral center?
‚Ä¢ 
A molecule of solvent or another weak base is usually all it takes to 
abstract that proton, leading to a return to aromaticity (and therefore 
stability), while leaving the new benzene-electrophile bond intact. 
Our substitution reaction is complete.
Generating Electrophiles
‚Ä¢ 
As simple as the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism 
seems, getting such a reaction started can be complicated because 
it requires a species so electronegative‚Äîso hungry for electrons‚Äî
that it can compensate for the temporary loss of aromaticity during

is to generate an adequately electrophilic substitution reagent. 
‚Ä¢ 
With regard to Zeidler‚Äôs synthesis of DDT, chloral itself is not 
electrophilic enough to react with the aromatic electrons of 
chlorobenzene. This is why Zeigler added a small amount of 
sulfuric acid to his reaction. Sulfuric acid is strong enough to 
protonate a carbonyl group like that of chloral, increasing the

Over the past two centuries, many researchers have devised ways to 
substitute benzene using many familiar functional groups, including 
QLWUDWLRQKDORJHQDWLRQDQGDON\ODWLRQ,QDOOWKUHHRIWKHVHFDVHV
simply mixing benzene with nitric acid, molecular bromine, or an

ways to make each of these three reagents even more electrophilic 
than they already are. 
‚Ä¢ 
Nitration of benzene is typically achieved by adding a bit of sulfuric 
acid to the mixture. The purpose of this sulfuric acid is to protonate 
the nitric acid, which acts as a base. Sulfuric acid is extremely 
strong, with a pKaRIDERXW√≠DQGFDQSURWRQDWHMXVWHQRXJKQLWULF
acid to get the process started.
‚Ä¢ 
Once protonated, nitric acid can lose a water molecule to form a 
species known as nitronium. The electron cloud around nitronium 
is exactly the same as that of carbon dioxide, but it has a central 
nitrogen atom instead. That extra proton in the nucleus of nitrogen 
means that the nitrogen now has a +1 charge associated with it. This 
dense region of positive charge, complete with oxygen atoms ready 
to accept pi electrons as the attack occurs, is all it takes to make an 
effective electrophile for nitration.
‚Ä¢ 
Halogenation of benzene is another highly desirable goal, but 
it is one that cannot be achieved simply by mixing benzene and

of chlorination is so effective that when taken to extremes, all 
six hydrogens from a benzene can be substituted with chlorine, 
producing hexachlorobenzene.

The same type of catalyst can be used to enhance the dipole of an 
alkyl halide to produce an alkylation. Alkylated benzene compounds 
produced in this way can be used to produce such useful products

When we substitute one nitrogen from benzene, like its nitration, or 
when we substitute all of its protons, like we did using chlorine and

intended product exists. But what about when we replace some, but 
not all, of the hydrogens around a benzene ring?
‚Ä¢ 
Once a substituent has been placed on the ring, the remaining 
hydrogens are no longer equivalent. We have two ortho positions, 
two meta positions, and one para position around the ring. 
Will the second substitution take place preferentially at one 
of these positions, or will we get a statistical mixture of all  
three possibilities?
‚Ä¢ 
This consideration is well illustrated by Zeidler‚Äôs successful DDT

caused substitutions at random locations around the ring, we would 
expect that any given sample of chlorobenzene molecules should 
produce a mixture of products that are 40% ortho, 40% meta, and 
only 20% para.

Moreover, the chances of a second substitution occurring at the

is performed, the desired regioisomer is the major product obtained. 
So, how did it come to be that chlorobenzene selectively undergoes 
electrophilic substitution at its para position?

‚Ä¢ 
Recall that there are three different positions available to react on a 
substituted benzene ring: two ortho positions, two meta positions, 
and one para position. Based on this distribution, one might expect

that, for example, brominating a nitrobenzene molecule would 
yield a mixture of products that is 40% ortho-, 40% meta-, and 20% 
para-substituted.

a preponderance of one product with just a small amount of the 
others. So, how does this preference to substitute at a particular 
location on the ring happen? The answer lies in the stability of the 
sigma complex transition states of all three reaction pathways.
‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs start by analyzing the three possible pathways for the 
electrophilic aromatic substitution of chlorobenzene. When an 
HOHFWURSKLOH ¬øQGV LWVHOI DW WKH PHWD SRVLWLRQ ZH VHH D WUDQVLWLRQ
state form in which three resonance contributors form, all of which 
look very similar to those in a simple benzene ring undergoing 
substitution.
‚Ä¢ 
However, when an electrophile attaches to the para position or 
the ortho position of the ring, we can draw a fourth resonance 
contributor. More contributors mean a more stable species. 
Hammond‚Äôs postulate, named after chemist George S. Hammond, 
says that a more stable intermediate in the rate-limiting step leads to a  
faster reaction.
‚Ä¢ 
,Q WHUPV RI WKH WKUHH SRVVLEOH SURGXFWV RI DQ\ HOHFWURSKLOLF
substitution of chlorobenzene, the meta-intermediate is similar 
in energy to substitution of benzene, but the ortho- and para-
intermediates are lower in energy, thus lowering the activation 
energies of the pathways for these two products.
‚Ä¢ 
So, the meta position of chlorobenzene is less reactive than the 
RUWKR DQG SDUD SRVLWLRQV ,Q IDFW FKORULQH LV SDUW RI D FODVV RI
VXEVWLWXHQWV FDOOHG RUWKRSDUD GLUHFWRUV 7R H[SODLQ ZK\ WKH SDUD
position is substituted more than the ortho requires that we look to 
our second consideration: ring activation and deactivation.

163
‚Ä¢ 
The second consideration is that the already-attached group may 
withdraw or donate electron density to the ring. Reducing electron 
density within the ring makes it less likely to attack, because doing 
so would only increase the magnitude of charge generated in the 
intermediate. Conversely, donating additional electron density to 
the ring would be expected to activate the ring and make it even 
more reactive.
‚Ä¢ 
One of the traits that makes chlorine and bromine so interesting 
in this reaction type is that they withdraw electrons from the ring 
inductively. This means that the electronegativity of chlorine causes 
it to pull electrons out of the ring. Unlike resonance, inductive 
effects attenuate with distance.
‚Ä¢ 
This gives us an explanation for the strong preference for the para 
position over the ortho position. The higher positive charge on the 
ortho atoms of chlorobenzene simply makes them less likely to 
attack an electrophile and take on even more positive charge.

the C-X bond.
‚Ä¢ 
Deactivating meta directors, such as nitrates, carboxylic acids, and 
aldehydes, all withdraw electrons strongly by resonance. All of 
these groups contain a heteroatom two bonds away from the ring.

Sugars that cannot be hydrolyzed into simpler compounds are 
called monosaccharides. When two such units are joined together 
in a condensation reaction, we get a disaccharide. Polysaccharides 
can have anywhere from just a few to thousands of condensed 
monosaccharide units.
Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides can be of varying length and organization but

the compound to get a carbonyl at one end. 
‚Ä¢ 
The inclusion of just one carbonyl solves the problem and gives 
us a framework on which to build our simple sugars. When the 
requisite carbonyl is placed at the end of the chain, we call these 
VXJDUVDOGRVHVIRUWKHDOGHK\GHJURXS,ILQVWHDGWKHFDUERQ\OLV
on an interior carbon, we call this a ketose (for the ketone motif  
it produces).

167
‚Ä¢ 
We name monosaccharides based on the number of carbon 
atoms contained therein. So, a six-carbon sugar with a terminal 
carbonyl is an aldohexose, whereas a six-carbon monosaccharide 
with an interior carbonyl is a ketohexose. This system is applied 
to all commonly occurring monosaccharides, which tend to have 
anywhere from three to seven carbons, with most ketoses having 
the carbonyl on the second carbon.
‚Ä¢ 
%XW VLPSO\ GH¬øQLQJ WKH QXPEHU RI FDUERQV LQ WKH FKDLQ DQG WKH
location of the carbonyl bond in a simple sugar isn‚Äôt enough to 
let us unambiguously identify carbohydrates. All along a chain of 
hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, and even the triose glyceraldehydes, 
there are one or more chiral centers. Particularly in the case of 
longer monosaccharaides like hexoses, chirality can generate a 
large number of potential stereoisomers. 
‚Ä¢ 
The drawing method known as Fischer projections is used to 
investigate stereoisomers. Fischer projections are created by 
drawing a compound so that all of the horizontally depicted bonds 
are coming out of the plane of the page and vertical bonds are 
falling back behind it.
‚Ä¢ 
Herman Emil Fischer won his Nobel Prize in part for his 
characterization of the structure of glucose, and a large part of his 
technique for this was to use his systematic form of projection, 
which made all of the stereochemical relationships in these complex 
molecules evident.
‚Ä¢ 
As a general rule, we draw monosaccharides in a Fischer 
projection with the terminal carbonyl at the top of the drawing. 
We can then number carbons of the chain from top to bottom to  
facilitate discussion.

most electrophilic and most likely to participate in substitution 
reactions, such as the reaction between alpha-D-glucopyranose and  
DFLGL¬øHGPHWKDQRO
‚Ä¢ 
This mixture generates an equilibrium mixture of both the 
alpha- and beta-functionalized monosaccharide. When the C1 
is functionalized, we call the product a glycoside, and the newly 
added group is called an aglycone.
‚Ä¢

sucrose, which consists of a glucose and a fructose unit linked by a 
bridging oxygen through one another‚Äôs anomeric carbon. So, in this 
unusual case, both sugars are acting as glycosides for themselves 
and as aglycones for their bonding partner.
‚Ä¢ 
Because both anomeric carbons are occupied by the glycosidic 
linkage, sucrose has no free anomeric carbon to open back up in 
equilibrium with the cyclic form. This is important because sugars 
are much more prone to oxidative degradation when in their acyclic 
forms. This makes sucrose much slower to oxidize than other 
disaccharides and a popular choice for use in preserves.
Polysaccharides
‚Ä¢ 
Polysaccharides are simply longer chains of sugars in which most 
of them are acting both as glycosides and as aglycones, perpetuating 
a polymer built from monosaccharide subunits. Many materials 
with which we are familiar are made from polysaccharides. For

DNA and Nucleic Acids
Lecture 23
E
legantly simple in its library of just four letters, but stunningly 
complex in the size and organization of those four letters, DNA and 
its chemical cousin RNA are familiar biopolymers that form the basis 
of life itself. Our understanding of DNA and the biochemical processes 
surrounding it has altered our perception of what it is to be a living thing. 
Scientists endeavor to study it, understand it, and ultimately manipulate it 
in ways that improve life. None of this understanding is possible without 
tearing this beautiful complex down into its most basic constituent parts‚Äî
which is the focus of this lecture.
RNA

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) serves several critical roles in converting

Like any other aldopentose, ribose can undergo cyclization to form 
the associated ribofuranose, with its anomeric carbon in one of

uracil (as opposed to the thymine of DNA), adenine, and guanine. 
These units are further subdivided into the class of pyrimidine bases 
and purine bases, based on their backbone structure.

174
Lecture 23: DNA and Nucleic Acids
‚Ä¢ 
Using one of these four bases as the aglycone in beta-ribofuranose 
produces one of the four subunits of RNA, collectively called 
nucleosides. Not surprisingly, these nucleosides have names similar 
to those of the bases that give them their identity. An aglycone of 
cytosine forms the nucleoside cytidine. Uracil leads to uridine. 
Adenine produces adenosine, and guanine produces guanosine.
‚Ä¢ 
The glue that holds the nucleoside subunits together into a chain‚Äî
so that there is a sequence to the collection of C‚Äôs, U‚Äôs, A‚Äôs, and

of our nucleoside, we create a motif called a phosphoester. 
The phosphoester group will be the linkage through which 
our nucleosides are connected to give our collection of  
information order.
‚Ä¢ 
This collection of three crucial elements‚Äîinformation in the base, 
the backbone of the ribose, and the glue of the phosphoester‚Äîmake 
up what is called a ribonucleotide, which is one complete subunit of 
RNA, ready to be linked to others to create a useful code.
‚Ä¢ 
RNA is nature‚Äôs messenger molecule, transporting information from 
the genetic code stored in DNA and assisting in the conversion of 
that information into the vast library of proteins that our bodies use 
to regulate its chemistry.
‚Ä¢

carried out on a fairly rapid time scale, RNA itself does not need

DNA
‚Ä¢ 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is another ribose-based biopolymer 
that serves a very different purpose. DNA is very similar to RNA, 
consisting of a phosphate, sugar, and base to form what we call  
a deoxyribonucleotide.

With this nucleophile out of the picture, DNA hydrolyzes about 100 
times slower than RNA. This makes DNA a much better choice not 
for a short-lived messenger, but for the storage of the genetic code 
that needs to last you the rest of your life.
‚Ä¢ 
A second feature of DNA that makes it a more robust system is the 
replacement of uracil with thymine, a methylated version of uracil. 
The reason for this difference is that cytosine itself can deaminate 
spontaneously to become uracil. When this happens to your DNA, 
this is bad news, because it means that your DNA mutated.

Russian researcher Phoebus Levene was able to identify the 
individual components of DNA, including the sugars, phosphates, 
and bases that comprised it. But he lacked the necessary tools to

place in history. What Watson and Crick proposed explained every 
observation to date: The sugar, phosphate, and base molecules 
found by Levene were all accounted for; the equal amounts of 
purine and pyrimidine bases from Chargaff‚Äôs experiments were 
easily explained; and the crystallography data from Wilhelm and 
Franklin‚Äôs labs, as well as Watson and Crick‚Äôs, clearly showed that 
a helical structure held them all together.
‚Ä¢ 
The key to putting it all together was that the two pyrimidine bases 
(adenine and thymine), when held in place by the helix proposed, 
formed a network of two hydrogen bonds, causing them to pair 
up. Guanine and cytosine formed a similar set of three hydrogen 

178

bonds when placed on adjacent strands. These base pairs and their 
non-covalent interactions (now called Watson-Crick pairs) are what 
hold the two strands of DNA together in an antiparallel alignment 
with one another. 
‚Ä¢ 
There is even more interaction going on with the base pairs. The 
pi systems of neighbors stack against each other, creating a strong, 
contributing dispersion force that holds them together. This 
interaction has been successfully targeted as a site for antitumor 
drugs, which can slip in between adjacent bases in rapidly growing 
cancer cells, causing kinks in their DNA strands, inhibiting their 
ability to replicate their genetic code and grow.

Protein Manufacturing
‚Ä¢ 
Another incredible use found for DNA is in the production of 
proteins for chemical research and as medical therapies. For 
example, human insulin is a relatively small protein, but it is critical 
to proper blood sugar management. Adults with type 2 diabetes 
suffer from an inability to produce the insulin needed to properly 
manage this critical solute in their blood. 
‚Ä¢ 
For decades, sufferers had to inject themselves with solutions of 
insulin taken from the pancreas of pigs, which is a great solution for 
most of the population. But a small variation in the pig version of 
insulin elicited an allergic reaction in a fraction of patients.
‚Ä¢ 
Enter DNA and the world 
of microbiology. For the 
past few decades, patients 
requiring insulin get not 
the porcine version of 
the protein, but an exact 
copy of human insulin‚Äî
and it does not come 
from the pancreas of a  
person, either.

human insulin and insert

drug chemistry, detergents, and many more functions. This class of 
PDWHULDOVLVSURWHLQV8VXDOO\DVVRFLDWHGZLWKVNLQKDLUDQGPXVFOH¬øEHUV
proteins make up a class of catalysts that mediate every chemical reaction 
that your body carries out. But before you can develop an appreciation for 
these large, complex kings of catalysis, you have to become familiar with 
their building blocks‚Äîamino acids.
Amino Acids
‚Ä¢ 
Amino acids are so named because this class of compound always 
has two distinct functional groups: an amine and an organic acid 
joined by one or more carbons. The simplest possible example 
is an amino acid in which amine and acid groups are joined by a 
single CH2 (methylene) group. When only one carbon separates the 
functional groups, we call these ‚Äúalpha‚Äù amino acids.
‚Ä¢ 
Extending the chain by one more methylene creates a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù amino 
acid, and yet another insertion creates a ‚Äúgamma‚Äù amino acid, and 
so on. Alpha amino acids are the ones that were chosen by nature as 
the basis for proteins; they are a very special set of compounds that 
carry out the chemistry of life.

182
Lecture 24: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
‚Ä¢ 
The simple alpha amino acid glycine has two different methylene 
K\GURJHQVRQLWVDOSKDFDUERQ,WLVWKLVSRVLWLRQWKDWLVPRGL¬øHG
to create a short library of 20 alpha amino acid compounds used 
to produce nearly all of the proteins and enzymes that drive the 
chemistry of life. When something other than a hydrogen is present 
in one of these positions, we refer to the group as a side chain. 
‚Ä¢ 
Of course, there is really no side, front, back, top, or bottom to a 
molecule, but when we align various amino acids for the purposes 
of comparison, we usually line up the amino acid portion of the 
molecule and treat the side chain as a motif branching off to the side. 
Even so, these bonds can twist and rotate and do not necessarily 
H[LVWORFNHGLQDVSHFL¬øFFRQ¬øJXUDWLRQ
‚Ä¢ 
Side chains can be broken down into several classes based on their 
chemistry. For example, aliphatic (or hydrocarbon) side chains are 
present in the amino acids alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. 
Acidic side chains are available on aspartic acid and glutamic acid. 
Hydroxyl groups make an appearance in threonine and serine. 
Nitrogen-containing side chains are on lysine as well as arginine 
and histidine. 
‚Ä¢ 
Aromatic side chains include phenylalanine, tyrosine, and 
tryptophan. Asparagine and glutamine have terminal amides. 
Methionine and cysteine contain sulfur atoms. Finally, proline is a 
curious amino acid whose side chain wraps back around and bonds 
to its own amine nitrogen.
‚Ä¢ 
All but glycine contain a chiral center at the alpha carbon, meaning 
that there are two possible enantiomers of each compound. 
Remarkably, all 19 amino acids with a chiral alpha carbon take on 
the same stereochemistry in living systems. So, only one enantiomer 
of each amino acid is useful biologically.
‚Ä¢ 
The reason for this is twofold. First, chiral RNA is responsible for 
sequestering and using these amino acids to build proteins, so only 
one handed form interacts properly with the ribosomal RNA. The 

183
other reason is that many amino acids are manufactured from one 
another in the body. Only 8 of the 20 are absolutely essential in 
your diet. The rest can be made by chemically modifying some of 
the 8 essentials.
Synthesis of Amino Acids
‚Ä¢ 
There are quite a few ways to produce amino acids from non-
biological sources, though biological sources are very attractive 
because amino acids make up a very large percentage of the 
biomass of living systems.

produce amino acids from aldehydes using ammonium chloride and 
potassium cyanide. His process generates an amino nitrile via an 
iminium intermediate. Ammonia is then eliminated with the use of 
an aqueous acid.
‚Ä¢ 
The most noteworthy amino acid synthesis was the one carried 
out by young graduate student Stanley Miller in the 1950s at the 
University of Chicago. Miller was a student of Harold Urey, who 
had a keen interest in the origin of life and had asked if it were 
possible for simple, vital organic compounds to form under the 
reducing, stormy conditions of the Earth‚Äôs early atmosphere. 
‚Ä¢ 
Miller designed a system that simulated the early Earth‚Äôs 
atmosphere in closed conditions on a lab bench. He enclosed water, 
methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and formaldehyde in a sealed vessel 
and allowed an electrical current to arc through the mixture for an 
extended period of time.
‚Ä¢ 
After running his apparatus for a week, Miller tapped the 
circulating solution and analyzed it. When he did, he found a broad 
range of amino acids. Miller himself detected 11 of the 20 amino

samples from his experiments have been analyzed and shown to 
contain all 20.

Lecture 24: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
Peptides and the Amide Bond
‚Ä¢ 
When we put amino acids together via a series of condensation 
reactions that form chains of amide bonds, the polyamides that 
result are called either peptides or proteins. The distinction 
between the two is one of size, with the former generally referring 
to polymers of less than 100 residues and the latter encompassing 
larger molecules.
‚Ä¢ 
For example, if we could condense two glycine residues together 
in an end-to-end relationship, we would create a very short chain 
consisting of two glycines, minus a water. The loss of the water 
is important, because it balances what would be an entropically 
disfavored reaction. 
‚Ä¢ 
We can continue the process, condensing another to make triglycine, 
then another, and so on. The result is a chain of glycine residues. 
We call them residues, instead of amino acids, because they have 
lost one equivalent of water when they are in the chain. 
‚Ä¢ 
Biochemists like to arrange their polyamides so that the nitrogen-
containing terminus is at the left, and the sequence can be read like 
a sentence from left to right‚ÄîN terminus to C terminus. 
‚Ä¢ 
Our polyglycine peptide is pretty boring as peptides go, but nature 
has provided us with 19 more options for each slot in the peptide. 
,WLVWKLVYDULHW\WKDWOHDGVWRVWXQQLQJFRPSOH[LW\LQWKHSRVVLEOH
sequences for peptides. We call each unique sequence of condensed 
amino acids a primary structure.
‚Ä¢ 
Furthermore, when amino acids condense to form an amide bond, 
the amine nitrogen from one residue and the carbonyl from the 
preceding residue participate in a resonance that locks in a plane

‚Ä¢ 
But that leaves the alpha-carbon bonds free to rotate, and this gives 
proteins a tendency to twist and collapse on themselves in very

the functional form of the 
protein is actually not the 
most stable fold. Proteins 
can become misfolded and 
trapped in a topology that 
will not allow them to fold 
properly. 
Ordinarily, 
it 
wouldn‚Äôt be too alarming if 
a single protein in your body 
misfolded. After all, you 
have millions and millions 
more to get the job done. 
‚Ä¢ 
But it does become disconcerting when one misfolded protein 
encourages the misfolding of others, producing plaques of proteins 
with potentially devastating health implications. This situation most 
notably happens when amyloid plaque builds in the brain of an 
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease victim.

as organometallic chemistry.
The Birth of Organometallic Chemistry
‚Ä¢ 
Organometallic chemistry got its start in the lab of Aleksandr 
Butlerov at the University of Kazan in Russia in the 1800s. Butlerov 
had noticed that dialkyl zinc reagents, chemicals containing 
two organic alkyl groups bonded directly to a zinc atom through 
their carbons, could be used to produce alcohols from ketones by 
transferring their alkyl group to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.
‚Ä¢ 
Excited about the prospect of developing a new method for the 
formation of carbon-carbon bonds, Butlerov passed this project 
on to his prot√©g√©, Aleksandr Zaitsev, who was able to apply its 
chemistry to several new substrates, but always with limited 
success. These zinc-based reagents proved to be unpredictable and 
GLI¬øFXOWWRZRUNZLWK
‚Ä¢ 
Then, in 1900, a young French graduate student by the name of 
Victor Grignard blew the lid off of organometallic chemistry 
by devising a powerful, versatile, and adaptable organometallic 
reagent for use in producing new carbon-carbon bonds.
‚Ä¢ 
,Q WKH ODWH V LQ 3KLOLSSH %DUELHU¬∂V ODE DW WKH 8QLYHUVLW\ GH
Lyons in France, while Grignard was conducting experiments for 
his doctoral dissertation, he acted on a hunch. He replaced the zinc 

189
from the only known class of organometallics of the day with what 
he believed would be more reactive magnesium. His work not only 
earned him his doctorate, but one-half of the Nobel Prize 12 years 
later. His corecipient was Paul Sabatier, for his metal-catalyzed 
hydrogen-addition reaction.
The Grignard Reaction
‚Ä¢ 
So, what had Grignard accomplished? He mixed an alkyl halide 
with magnesium metal in ether. This combination of reagents 
produced what we would call an alkyl magnesium halide, in this 
case an alkylmagnesium bromide. This process involves two 
distinct radical reactions that take place when the alkyl halide bond 
spontaneously and breaks, sending one electron each way.
‚Ä¢ 
So, we have two radicals, hungry for a partner for that unpaired 
electron. We also have neutral magnesium metal, with two valence 
electrons that it is more than willing to give up to establish its own 
octet. The magnesium strikes a deal with the two radicals and 
inserts itself between the alkyl group and the halide, forming two 
new covalent bonds‚Äîone to the halide radical, and then one to the 
alkyl radical. From an octet perspective, everyone is happy again. 
‚Ä¢ 
But in regard to the covalent bond between the carbon and 
magnesium, magnesium has a very low electronegativity‚Äî
so low, in fact, that we usually refer to it instead as having high

Of course, when Grignard made it, his reagent was not a carbanion, 
but an alkyl magnesium bromide reagent, which means that we 
have to account for the magnesium and bromine. What happens to 
them during the nucleophilic attack is a bit complicated and case-

Exposing these species to aqueous acid leads to carboxylic acid and

‚Ä¢ 
Grignard‚Äôs new nucleophile could be used to produce acids from 
carbon dioxide, secondary alcohols from aldehydes, and tertiary 
DOFRKROVIURPNHWRQHV,WVHHPVWKDWDQ\WKLQJZLWKDFDUERQ\OLVIDLU
game for them. Grignard reagents are extremely versatile, offering 
not only ways to make alcohols and acids, but also aldehydes from 
amides, tertiary alcohols from esters, and many more. 
‚Ä¢ 
But there is much more to the Grignard reaction. Easy though it is 
to run, there are a few special considerations that must be taken to 
ensure its success. First, the Grignard reagent itself is only stable 
in ether solvents like diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. Second, 
the reaction mixture must be kept extraordinarily free of protic 
solvents, including water.
Ethers and Protic Solvents in Grignard Syntheses
‚Ä¢ 
One of the great limitations of Grignard reactions is that 
alkylmagnesium halide reagents can only form in ether solvents. 
But why? The answer lies in the ability of solvents to coordinate 
metals. The solvent must have oxygen atoms with lone pairs 
that can stabilize the Grignard by donating electrons to form a 
stabilizing metal-oxygen interaction in solution.

191
‚Ä¢ 
That alkyl magnesium halide motif is so polar that it needs a solvent 
WKDWZLOOEHDEOHWRDUUDQJHLWVGLSROHWREHQH¬øFLDOO\LQWHUDFWZLWK
the positive charge density at the magnesium. For this purpose, 
ethereal solvents are just the ticket. Nonpolar solvents like hexanes 
or benzene are not capable of forming such stabilizing interactions, 
so they are clearly out.
‚Ä¢ 
Grignard reagents are really polar, so why can‚Äôt we use more polar 
solvents like ethanol to dissolve them for reactions? Ethanol has 
enough polar punch to get this reagent to form in solution, but it is 
protic, with a pKa of about 17. Recall that Grignard reagents react 
like carbanions, whose conjugate acid has a pKa of about 60. So, a 
Grignard reagent will form in ethanol‚Äîfor a split second before 
reacting with the ethanol to form ethoxide and a hydrocarbon. This 
is not a good way to make a Grignard.
‚Ä¢ 
Ethers like diethyl ether and THF are special because they strike 
a balance between their ability to solvate a Grignard with their 
inability to react with it, and this is why they have been the preferred 
solvent for this sort of reaction from 1900 until today.
‚Ä¢ 
But using ether and THF isn‚Äôt enough. Because it is slightly polar, 
ether can dissolve a small bit of water. Our solution to this is to use 
ether that has been chemically dried before use. We accomplish this 
through the use of inorganic drying agents like magnesium sulfate 
or molecular sieves, which act like sponges, absorbing the water 
IURPWKHHWKHUDQGWUDSSLQJLWDVDVROLGFRPSOH[WKDWFDQEH¬øOWHUHG
or decanted away.
‚Ä¢ 
A more modern substitution for many Grignard reagents is 
n-butyllithium, which itself can by made by mixing n-butylchloride 
or bromide with lithium metal and is preferred over other 
alkyllithium reagents for its relative stability. Bottles of this reagent 
can be purchased and stored for short periods of time, while 
Grignard reagents usually must be prepared at the time of use.

Biological Organometallics
‚Ä¢ 
Some of the most astonishingly powerful organometallic catalysts 
are the ones at work in your body right now. For example, if we 
remove all of the protein atoms from a subunit of the structure of 
human hemoglobin, left over is a large, cyclic ligand coordinating

‚Ä¢ 
But nature has gone far 
beyond just using iron ions 
to get the job done. For 
example, 
hemocyanin‚Äî

transports oxygen in crustaceans like crabs and lobsters. This 
enzyme contains two copper ions coordinated to the protein matrix, 
giving lobsters, crabs, and many other marine animals a very 
different blood chemistry than mammals.

Synthetic Polymers
Lecture 26
A 
tremendous amount of attention has been poured into understanding,

body armor, and more, the importance of synthetic polymers to our modern 
lifestyles cannot be overstated. This lecture will provide a short survey of 
polymer chemistry‚Äîhow polymers are designed, how they are made, and a 
few ways in which they have changed the world. 
Polymers

more repeating units known as monomers. Biologically relevant

method is to distinguish them based on how they are prepared. 
From this perspective, most polymers fall into one of two general 
classes: addition polymers or condensation polymers. 
‚Ä¢ 
Addition polymers are formed when monomers react with the end 
of a growing chain. Addition polymers tend to be prepared from 
alkene subunits, trading less-stable pi bonds for the new sigma

polystyrene, falls into this class of compounds. The process of 
creating addition polymers consists of three phases: initiation, 
propagation, and termination.

a sample of styrene is heated in the presence of a small amount 
of benzoyl peroxide. The heat causes the benzoyl peroxide to 
dissociate into two phenyl radicals, a process encouraged by the 
loss of carbon dioxide gas.

termination, two growing radicals react with one another, forming 
one last sigma bond that consumes the radicals without generating 
a new one.
‚Ä¢ 
Addition polymers are very attractive targets for commercial 
materials because their properties can be tuned by controlling the 
overall size of the macromolecules produced in the chain-growth 
reaction. The size of addition polymer molecules can be controlled 
simply by altering the relative amount of benzoyl peroxide added: 
Relatively fewer benzoyl peroxide molecules means fewer growing 
chains, and because growth can only take place at the end of an 
initiated chain, one expects to obtain longer polymers in such a 
scenario. Additionally, fewer growing chains equates to a lesser 
chance that two growing chains will encounter one another in a 
termination step.
‚Ä¢ 
Another example of an addition polymer is the polyethylene used 
in plastic bottles, formed by the addition of ethene monomers 
to one another. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), most well known 
as a substitute for metal plumbing pipes, is assembled in a 
similar reaction using vinyl chloride monomers. Even the once-

WHWUD√ÄXRURHWK\OHQHPRQRPHUV
‚Ä¢ 
The second major class of polymers is condensation polymers, 
which differ from addition polymers in that their growth is driven 
not by trading of pi bonds for sigma bonds, but by the formation of 
small molecule by-products. 

197
‚Ä¢ 
A perfect example of this is the formation of nylon-6, in which 
molecules of 6-aminohexanoic acid are joined together in a reaction 
that produces not only an amide union between monomers, but also 
a molecule of water as a by-product. 
‚Ä¢ 
Condensation polymers are also called step-growth polymers, 
because unlike chain-growth polymers, condensation can take place 
at any time between any monomers or growing polymers. 
Copolymers
‚Ä¢ 
When polymers are constructed from multiple monomers, we 
refer to them collectively as copolymers. Copolymers can take on 
a vast array of arrangements, including alternating copolymers, in 
which monomers regularly repeat; random copolymers, in which 
a statistically random arrangement of monomers exists; block 
FRSRO\PHUV ZKLFK DUH FKDUDFWHUL]HG E\ ODUJH GH¬øQHG UHJLRQV
consisting of one monomer type or the other; and graft copolymers, 
in which a polymer of one monomer supports polymers of another.
‚Ä¢ 
A familiar alternating polymer is produced when vinyl chloride and 
vinylidine chloride react in a radical chain-growth polymerization. 
,QWKLVUHDFWLRQPRQRPHUVDGGLQDQDOWHUQDWLQJRUGHUZLWKYLQ\O
chloride monomers reacting at initiated viniylidine termini and 
vinylidene chloride monomers reacting at initiated vinyl chloride 
termini. The result is an alternating polymer called saran, which is 
used to make the very popular food wrap that bears its name. 
‚Ä¢ 
But alternating polymers can just as easily be produced using 
condensation polymerizations. One example of this is the polymer 
nylon-6,6, which is prepared using equal parts of adipic acid and 
1,6-hexanediamine.
‚Ä¢

Lecture 26: Synthetic Polymers
‚Ä¢ 
The development of the homopolymer nylon-6 by BASF was an 
attempt to produce a material with similar properties that did not 
infringe on Dupont‚Äôs intellectual property. Both of these polymers 
were a huge success and are still used today as the backbone for 
some of the most modern materials produced by both companies.
‚Ä¢ 
Random copolymers are produced by mixing monomers, but 
unlike alternating copolymers, growing random copolymers 
can incorporate any of the monomers in any order, leading to a 
statistically random distribution of monomers in the macromolecule. 
‚Ä¢ 
An example of a random copolymer is polybutyrate, which 
is a polyester compound built from two distinct subunits. 
The distinction is that these subunits are randomly oriented

random copolymer are completely deconstructed by moisture and 
microbes in the ground.
‚Ä¢ 
One of the more exciting advances in recent decades has been the 
development of block copolymers, which aim to exploit the best 
properties of more than one polymer by linking together large 
regions of each, called domains.
‚Ä¢ 
The block copolymer SBS‚Äîwhich stands for poly(styrene-
butadiene-styrene)‚Äîis used in many modern applications, 
LQFOXGLQJWLUHVDQGVKRHVROHV,QDVLQJOHPROHFXOHRIWKLVEORFN
copolymer, a domain of polybutadiene is sandwiched in between 
two polystyrene domains.
‚Ä¢ 
The polystyrene blocks give this polymer great toughness, while 
the polybutadiene domain becomes softer under high-temperature 
conditions, allowing the material to be more easily moldable like 
softer rubbers. The result is a material that behaves more like plastic 
at high temperature, but more like vulcanized rubber when cooler. 

199
‚Ä¢ 
Graft copolymers are characterized by a uniform backbone 
polymer that is decorated by strands of a different polymer attached 
FRYDOHQWO\DORQJLWVOHQJWK,QPDQ\FDVHVJUDIWFRSRO\PHUVFDQEH
designed to have certain properties of both polymers that make it up.
‚Ä¢ 
Examples include long polysacharides like cellulose onto which 
other polymers are grafted. This has the effect of producing a very 
large molecule with many of the properties of the smaller grafted 
polymers while retaining the biodegradability of the cellulose 
backbone.
Cross-Linking Polymers
‚Ä¢ 
Natural rubber is a somewhat complex mixture created by trees 
WRGHIHQGWKHPVHOYHVIURPZRRGHDWLQJLQVHFWV,WKDVTXLWHDIHZ
minor components, but the big player in its chemical properties 
is a polyisoprene macromolecule made on long, unsaturated 
hydrocarbons, making it very thick and insoluble in water.
‚Ä¢ 
The problem is that these polyisoprene macromolecules are only 
held together by dispersion forces stemming from their electron 
clouds. These forces are enough to make the molecule viscous, 
but they can be overcome. So, when we pull on natural rubber 
molecules, they can slide back and forth with one another.

for producing a variation of rubber that would be strong enough 
to produce objects that could be molded into a desired shape but 
would then retain that shape across a greater range of conditions. 
His method involved steam heating a mixture of natural rubber 
with sulfur. 
‚Ä¢ 
What Goodyear accomplished by the addition of sulfur was to 
cross-link the polymer molecules with covalent bonds to sulfur. 
With these bonds in place, the material can still be deformed 
slightly, but as soon as it is released, it snaps back into its  
original position.

200
Lecture 26: Synthetic Polymers
‚Ä¢ 
So, the presence of these cross-
links is what gives vulcanized 
rubber its toughness and ability 
to retain its shape‚Äîexactly 
what you would hope for in a 
product like an automobile tire.

to recycle.
Polycarbonates and Bisphenol A
‚Ä¢ 
Another 
common 
polymer 
motif is polycarbonates. These 
polymers are found in materials 
as tough and rigid as bulletproof 
glass and as soft and supple as commercial water bottles. Both of 
these products are made from the condensation of carbonic acid 
with bisphenol A (BPA) to form an alternating copolymer.
‚Ä¢ 
Recently, concern has arisen over the possibility that these polymers 
can hydrolyze back into their starting materials over time, leaching 
bisphenol A into the water or beverage that they contain. The 
reason for so much concern is mounting evidence that bisphenol 
A imitates estradiol in the body, potentially causing developmental 
and reproductive problems.
‚Ä¢ 
Some studies suggest that BPA is less than 0.0001 as powerful of 
a hormone as estradiol is, suggesting that this controversy may 
be overblown. Still, we simply don‚Äôt know what the long-term 
effects of exposure to low levels of BPA might do. Regardless, 
PDQ\SHRSOHDUHVXI¬øFLHQWO\ZDU\RI%3$WKDWWKH\DUHZLOOLQJWR
purchase products labeled ‚ÄúBPA-free‚Äù without giving much thought 
to what is actually in the plastic.
Modern tires can be deformed 
slightly, but will snap back into 
their original position.
¬ã)XVH7KLQNVWRFN

201
‚Ä¢ 
The polymers industry has 
responded to these concerns by 
offering BPA-free plastics with 
a great deal of fanfare. What 
they do not tell you, however, 
is that most of these products 
are still polycarbonates that are 
simply made using molecules 
like bisphenol S or bisphenol 
F in place of bisphenol A in an 
analogous reaction.
Plasticizers
‚Ä¢ 
Another hot-button plastics issue is the use of compounds called 
phthalates. Phthalic acid is a small organic diacid that is easily 
HVWHUL¬øHG ZLWK D QXPEHU RI DOLSKDWLF DOFRKROV WR SURGXFH VPDOO
molecules called phthalates.
‚Ä¢ 
Phtalates‚Äîlike dibutyl phthalate, for example‚Äîare sometimes 
added to polyvinyl chloride to soften the plastic enough to make 
it useful over a wider range of applications. Plasticizers work by 
disrupting the packing of the polymer chains‚Äîin this case, in the 
PVC, causing it to soften. That new car smell many people love is 
caused by these plasticizers, escaping the newly prepared plastics 
into the air.
‚Ä¢ 
Polyethylenetetraphthalate (PETE) is used in food packaging and 
does not contain isolated phthalate molecules. The ‚Äú-phthalate‚Äù 
portion of PETE‚Äôs name refers to the monomer that is condensed 
to prepare the polymer. So, in this case, the phthalate is locked 
securely in the matrix of this nonbiodegradable plastic, where it 
cannot easily be released.
‚Ä¢ 
So, PETE doesn‚Äôt release phthalates into the environment even 
though ‚Äú-phthalate‚Äù is in its name, and PVC very often does release 
phthalates, even though the term ‚Äú-phthalate‚Äù is nowhere to be 
found in its name.
Most products labeled ‚ÄúBPA-free‚Äù 
are still polycarbonates.

lecture will explore the science of spectroscopy. Most simply put, 
spectroscopy is the observation of the interaction of light with matter. Over 
the next few lectures, you will learn about some of the ways that scientists 
coax structural information from molecules using spectrometers to sense 
how they interact with different forms of light. This lecture begins in the 
visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.
Light
‚Ä¢ 
What we generally refer to as ‚Äúlight‚Äù is, in fact, electromagnetic 
radiation, a form of self-propagating energy composed of

carries that are most interesting to spectroscopists, and we therefore 
tend to classify light based on these properties. 
‚Ä¢ 
One of the properties associated with waves is the wavelength‚Äîthe 
distance from one point on the wave to the next analogous point. 
$QRWKHU SURSHUW\ RI OLJKW LV YHORFLW\ /LJKW KDV D ¬ø[HG VSHHG DW
which it travels in a given medium, regardless of its wavelength. 
Light in a vacuum always travels at 3.0 √ó 108 meters per second. 
The frequency of light is the number of equivalent points along the 
ZDYHWKDWSDVVE\DJLYHQORFDWLRQLQDVSHFL¬øHGWLPH
‚Ä¢ 
The constant speed of light becomes a proportionality constant 
for the relationship between wavelength and the reciprocal of the 
frequency: c = hv. To put it simply, because of the constant speed 
of all light, cutting the wavelength in half results in a doubling  
of the frequency.

204
Lecture 27: UV-Visible Spectroscopy
‚Ä¢ 
Another property of light that is crucial to understanding 
spectroscopy is that light does still have some particle character. 
We call these particles of light photons. A single photon of light 
contains an amount of energy that is directly related to its frequency 
by a factor called Planck‚Äôs constant (h). A single photon of light has 
an associated wavelength, frequency, and energy that are all related 
to one another.
‚Ä¢ 
We classify light according to its frequency or wavelength, which 
are related to the amount of energy carried by a single photon of that 
light. The known range of wavelengths is called the electromagnetic 
spectrum. This spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency 
(and energy): radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, 
and gamma ray.
The electromagnetic spectrum includes not only what we can see with the naked 
eye, but also higher- and lower-frequency wavelengths.

had just the tool for the job‚Äîsilver chloride.

the same speed in different colors of light. He could disperse light 
with a prism, then place vials of silver chloride solution in different 
parts of the resulting spectrum, and clearly see that the reaction was 
fastest in blue, slower in green, and slower still in red.
‚Ä¢ 
Ritter‚Äôs real contribution was that he decided to place a vial of silver 
chloride solution outside of the blue-colored light from the prism. 
The solution outside of the blue end of the spectrum reacted even 
faster than any of the samples within the visible area. 
‚Ä¢ 
This experiment is remarkable because it clearly demonstrated the 
existence of light with a frequency even higher than the violet light 
at the edge of the visible spectrum‚Äîone that was not detectable to 
the human eye but had even more energy than visible light. Ritter 
had discovered ultraviolet light.
‚Ä¢ 
Of course, since Ritter‚Äôs day, the science of spectroscopy has come 
a long way. We no longer have to move a sample from one band of 
light to the next to observe how a sample is interacting with light.

‚Ä¢ 
All spectrometers have the same basic functional parts. How 
each part functions can be very different depending on the design 
and the technique needed to solve a particular problem, but all 
spectrometers consist of several crucial parts.
‚Ä¢ 
First is a light source that generates a broad spectrum of light. This 
can be as simple as an ordinary incandescent lightbulb or a more 
advanced lamp. The light from this source is sent to a device called 
a monochromator. The simplest example of this would be Newton‚Äôs 
prism dispersing sunlight into its constituent parts. Modern 
monochromators are usually more sophisticated and vary widely  
in design. 
‚Ä¢ 
The most common tool for this purpose is known as a diffraction 
grating, which accomplishes the same effect as the prism but can 
be very precisely machined to produce much narrower bands

measurements.
‚Ä¢ 
The light produced by the lamp and monochromator is passed 
through a sample one wavelength at a time. The sample can be 
solid, liquid, gas, or solution. Most commonly in the organic 
chemistry lab, we want to characterize the interaction of light with 
a compound in solution, so we use a quartz cell sometimes called a 
cuvette to hold the sample. 
‚Ä¢ 
The sample is held securely in the sample compartment, where light 
from the monochromator passes through it. As light exits the sample 
compartment, it strikes a detector that turns the light intensity into 
an electrical signal that can be interpreted by a computer.
‚Ä¢ 
As the monochromator is adjusted to send different wavelengths 
of light to the sample, the detector measures the intensity of the 
exiting light at each wavelength and compares it to the intensity of 
the original beam when no sample is present.

August Beer, who is most well known for his law of absorbance, 
which he proposed in 1852. His law is concerned not with the 
maximum wavelength of absorption, but with just how strongly a 
given compound or sample absorbs.
‚Ä¢ 
Beer observed that incrementally increasing the concentration of a 
chromophore, or colored chemical compound, cut the transmittance 
by half each time. Similarly, for a given concentration, the 
transmittance was cut in half when the length of the cell was 
increased incrementally.
‚Ä¢ 
This relationship produces an exponential relationship. But 
scientists prefer to work with linear relationships, which are much 
easier to predict. So, Beer converted transmittance to a new unit, 
called absorbance. The absorbance is the negative logarithm of a 
sample‚Äôs transmittance. The resulting plot is a very simple, very 
useful relationship in which incremental concentration or path 
length increases lead to incremental absorbance values.
‚Ä¢ 
Beer‚Äôs equation relates absorption to three important factors: a 
property of a given molecule called its molar absorptivity (which is 
essentially a measure of how well it absorbs at a given wavelength), 
the concentration of the sample, and the path length of the cell used 
in the experiment.

and this energy can be calculated from its wavelength and Planck‚Äôs 
constant using the relationship E = hcL. Let‚Äôs set the rule that this

an electron to a higher energy state when the orbital energy gap is 
exactly equal to the energy packet of the photon.

‚Ä¢ 
We can construct an energy diagram for the molecular orbitals of 
a conjugated system, and when we do this for 1,3-butadiene and 
1,3,5-hexatriene, we discover that the frontier molecular orbitals are 
closer in energy in the more conjugated compound. So, there is a 
distinct correlation between the wavelength of maximum absorption 
and the extent of conjugation in 
organic compounds. And this 
trend continues into the visible 
spectrum as well.

‚Ä¢ 
UVC radiation spans 100 nm to 280 nm wavelengths. UVC is the 
portion of the ultraviolet spectrum that isn‚Äôt normally found at the 
surface of the Earth, because it is naturally absorbed by the gasses 
in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. This high-energy, potentially damaging 
radiation is absorbed by two naturally occurring atmospheric gasses 
in particular: oxygen, which absorbs between 100 nm and 200 nm, 
and ozone, which absorbs between about 200 nm and 280 nm. 
These two gasses work in concert to protect us from all of the most 
dangerous ultraviolet light reaching the planet.

portion of the ultraviolet spectrum that reaches the surface and 
causes reddening of the skin, known commonly as sunburn. 
Because of this, it was long thought that UVB rays were the 
only dangerous form of ultraviolet radiation reaching the planet‚Äôs 
surface, leading companies to produce sunblock formulations 
containing compounds like para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which 
absorbs very well right up to the edge of the UVB.
Modern sunblock formulations are effective against both UVA and UVB rays.

UVA radiation spans the 315 nm to 400 nm region of the spectrum.

light was not harmful to humans because it did not cause sunburn 
OLNH 89% ,Q WKH ODWHU GHFDGHV RI WKH V KRZHYHU PHGLFDO
researchers began to recognize that UVA light can, in fact, cause 
cellular damage even though it does not cause a reddening of the 
skin. So, modern sunblock formulations have abandoned PABA in 
favor of compounds like octocrylene and avobenzone.
‚Ä¢ 
When we look at the ultraviolet spectrum as a whole and at those 
materials that we use to protect ourselves from it, both man-made 
and naturally occurring, the trend is that increasing the size of the 
conjugated pi system in the compounds correlates directly with 
the wavelength of maximum absorption in the compound. From 
oxygen, to ozone, to PABA, octocrylene, and avobenzone, each is 
larger and more conjugated than the next.

of light known as infrared. Scientists like those at NASA have 
developed cameras and 
telescopes 
capable 
of 
detecting 
the 
infrared 
emissions of both small 
objects on Earth and 
celestial bodies on the 
other side of the known 
universe, creating false-
color images, in which 
the detected infrared light 
has been shown.
‚Ä¢ 
But infrared light isn‚Äôt 
just radiated. Like all 
other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, it can also be absorbed. 
And just as a warm object cools by radiating energy as infrared 
light, an object can be warmed by absorbing it.
Though invisible to the naked eye, 
infrared light can be captured using 
sensitive cameras.

Wilhelm Ritter‚Äôs experiment that resulted from his hunch to look 
outside of the blue end of the visible spectrum was almost certainly 
inspired by one conducted earlier that year by Sir William Herschel, 
who made a truly inspired discovery when he asked a simple 
question: Which color of light is most effective at heating a surface 
on which it is shined? To answer this question, he used a prism to 
diffract sunlight into a spectrum and placed thermometers with 
blackened bulbs at regular intervals within that spectrum. 
‚Ä¢ 
Herschel saw that the temperature indicated by the thermometers 
increased across the spectrum from blue to red. Knowing what we 
do about the amount of energy contained in photons of different

objects near room temperature.
‚Ä¢ 
But the pertinent result of Herschel‚Äôs experiment wasn‚Äôt the trend 
he saw in the visible spectrum. His real breakthrough came when 
he wondered if the trend continued beyond the spectrum that he 
could see. Sure enough, when he placed a thermometer just beyond 
the red portion of the spectrum, it read an even higher temperature 
than the one in the red light. Clearly, there was some form of light 
beyond the red portion of the spectrum, prompting him to call his 
new discovery ‚Äúinfrared‚Äù light.
Infrared Spectrometers
‚Ä¢ 
Modern spectroscopy in the infrared region is conducted using an 
instrument very similar to those used for UV-visible. Both start 
with a source lamp, though the infrared source lamp is made of a 
different material that generates more infrared light.
‚Ä¢ 
The infrared beam is split using a mirror, which sends the beam to 
two different cells. One is the reference cell, containing no sample, 
and the other is the sample cell, containing the molecules we want 
to analyze.

called a beam splitter, which allows only one of the two beams to 
make it to the detector at a given time. After passing through a 
monochromator, the intensities of the two beams are compared at 
the detector to calculate the transmittance of a sample.

think of molecules in terms of dynamic models, rather than the 
idealized structures‚Äîsymmetrical, rigid, unmoving‚Äîthat are so 
often depicted in the literature, models, textbooks, and television. 
Dynamic simulations approximate the random motions of each 
atom within the molecule. The bonds between and among the 
atoms stretch, bend, and twist in numerous ways. Put simply,  
bonds vibrate.
‚Ä¢ 
Consider carbon monoxide‚Äîtwo atoms joined by a triple bond. 
With only two atoms, there is only one possible bond vibration that 
can take place: a stretching between the atoms. But when we move 
on to carbon dioxide, a molecule with three atoms, we can conceive 
of vibrations involving a symmetrical stretch, an asymmetrical 
stretch, symmetrical bending, and asymmetrical bending. So, there 
are four different ways in which CO2 can vibrate.

complex molecules have dozens or even hundreds of vibrational

Infrared Absorption
‚Ä¢ 
What is it that brings these two apparently disparate concepts‚Äî
how infrared spectroscopy is conducted and the vibration of bonds 
and sets of bonds in organic molecules‚Äîtogether? The answer is 

215
that many bond vibrational frequencies are the same as those of 
infrared light, and just as an electronic transition could be promoted 
by just the right photon in UV-visible spectroscopy, a transition 
in the vibrations of a molecule can be induced by just the right  
infrared photon.
‚Ä¢ 
When a bond vibrating at a particular frequency encounters a photon 
of identical frequency, that photon can be absorbed, increasing the 
amplitude of the associated vibration. This is the absorption that is 
measured by the spectrometer. For example, if our spectrometer 
reports to us that photons with a frequency of 2000 hertz are being 
absorbed, we know that there must be a bond vibrating at that 
frequency within the molecule.
‚Ä¢ 
Of course, we have a pretty good idea of the vibrational frequencies 
of different types of bonds near room temperature. The trend is

7KHUHLVRQHPRUHFDWFKWRWKHVFLHQFHRILQIUDUHGVSHFWURVFRS\,W
is known as the infrared selection rule, which states that a vibrating 
bond or set of bonds can only absorb a photon of the same frequency 
if that vibration causes a change in the dipole of the molecule. No 
dipole change means no absorption; strong dipole change means 
strong absorption. 
‚Ä¢ 
Functional groups, which usually have strong dipoles, are often 
powerful infrared absorbers, while less-reactive bonds, such as alkyl 
C-H bonds, tend to absorb very weakly or sometimes not at all. 
‚Ä¢ 
Most functional groups contain good, strong polar bonds to at least 
one hydrogen or double and triple bonds among larger atoms (or 
both). So, the signatures associated with most common functional

the mineral calcite. Calcite is unusual among common minerals 
because of a property called birefringence. Calcite has the ability 
to refract light at two different angles, depending on the orientation 
of the electromagnetic waves making up the incident light. Those 
waves oscillating perpendicular to the surface of the stone refract 
at an angle different than others, creating a second image when one 
looks through the stone. 
‚Ä¢ 
Scientists now know that light from the Sun that penetrates the 
Earth‚Äôs atmosphere undergoes a process known as scattering, which 
happens when light encounters small particles in the air. Some 
familiar effects of this scattering are the blue color of the sky in 

219
the day and the reddish and orange hues of sunset. A second effect 
is polarization. The scattering that goes on as the light enters the 
atmosphere causes light that reaches the surface to have waves that 
are not randomly oriented, but rather polarized, or preferentially 
oriented in a direction that points back to the source‚Äîin our case, 
the Sun.
‚Ä¢ 
Human eyes are not capable of detecting the difference between 
polarized light coming directly from the Sun and diffuse light 
coming from other directions, but with its strong birefringent 
properties, calcite is. By scanning the horizon looking though the 
stone and comparing the intensities of the two images one sees, 
a skilled navigator can 
pick out the direction of 
the Sun even on the most 
overcast of days.

years, like our Sun. Malus used the Sun as a source of light, the

gets through to the polarizer. The polarizer, much like the windows 
of the palace, ensures that only one plane of polarization makes it 
to a sample compartment. So, at this point, we have plane-polarized 
light of a single wavelength encountering a sample.

Small organic molecules in solution aren‚Äôt aligned like polymer

randomly, so they do not preferentially absorb plane-polarized light 
like a pair of sunglasses. They do, however, interact with plane-
polarized light in a different way.

Lecture 29: Measuring Handedness with Polarimetry
‚Ä¢ 
Chiral molecules have the interesting ability to rotate plane-
SRODUL]HG OLJKW $V D SODQHSRODUL]HG OLJKW EHDP RI D VSHFL¬øF
wavelength passes through a chiral sample, the plane of polarization 
rotates, so that when the beam exits the sample, the plane of 
polarization has a new orientation. 
‚Ä¢ 
The polarimeter must rotate the second polarizer to let the exiting 
light through to reach the detector. So, the instrument rotates the 
second polarizer until the detector sees the maximum intensity of 
OLJKW7KHDQJOHEHWZHHQWKHLQLWLDODQG¬øQDOSODQHVRISRODUL]DWLRQ
is called alpha. This is the measured rotation in a given experiment.
‚Ä¢ 
This ability of chiral molecules to rotate plane-polarized light 
is called optical activity, and just as the ability to absorb light is

other words, a given chiral compound rotates a certain wavelength

bracketed alpha.

visible spectroscopy, there are no anti-absorbers that reemit the 
light absorbed by their counterparts, canceling them out. But in 
polarimetry, there is such a counterpart‚Äîthe other enantiomer of 
the compound. 
‚Ä¢ 
We have to include a term in our equation that accounts for the 
opposing rotation of the minor enantiomer. Both terms of the 
equation share the same optical rotation and path length, so we can 
separate these algebraically and arrive at an equation that works for 
samples of a compound that are not enantiopure.

and (S) enantiomers. This difference is also called the enantiomeric 
excess. Journal articles covering chiral syntheses will always 
include a measure of the enantiomeric excess of the desired chiral 
product, reported as a percentage simply calculated by dividing 
the observed rotation by the calculated rotation and multiplying  
by 100%.

the link between chirality and biological systems. Louis Pasteur 
famously used this technique in 1848 to analyze tartaric acid salt 
crystals isolated from wine. Pasteur‚Äôs experiments showed very 
clearly that biologically sourced tartaric acid had the ability to 
rotate plane-polarized light but that tartaric acid synthesized in the 
laboratory did not. 
‚Ä¢ 
This lack of optical activity was a conundrum that lead Pasteur 
to take a very close look at synthetic tartaric acid. When he did, 
he noticed that carefully crystallized tartaric acid actually forms

Fortunately, we have better methods today, but they all are 
dependent on Pasteur‚Äôs realization that the same compound can 
have two equal but opposite optically active forms‚Äîenantiomers.
‚Ä¢ 
But polarimetry has contributed even more to our understanding 
of organic reactions. One classical example of this is the work of 
Saul Winstein, who used polarimetry to recognize that not all SN1 
reactions proceed with total loss of stereochemistry, although most 
of them do.

224
Lecture 29: Measuring Handedness with Polarimetry
‚Ä¢ 
Winstein was able to show using polarimetry that the same SN1 
solvolysis reaction run in solvents of differing polarity not only 
proceeds at differing rates, but also with differing degrees of

racemic product when reacted in 50:50 water and alcohol but with 
50% enantiomeric excess when run in alcohol alone.
‚Ä¢ 
This led Winstein to theorize the existence of concerted ion pairs, 
in which positively charged carbocations and negatively charged 
leaving groups stay close to one another in what he called an 
LQWLPDWHLRQSDLU,IDQXFOHRSKLOHDWWDFNVEHIRUHWKHLRQSDLUIXOO\
dissociates, the leaving group (though detached) can still block the 
face of the carbocation from which it came. This explains the lack 
of total racemization in a reaction showing SN1 kinetics, and the 
theory got its start with a polarimetry experiment.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Lecture 30
,
n this lecture, you are going to learn about yet another region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. You will go all the way to the long-wavelength 
end of the spectrum‚Äîbeyond infrared and past microwaves all the way 
to the radio portion of the spectrum. But before doing so, you need to better 
understand a property of atoms that is usually thought of as more within the 
realm of physics than of organic chemistry: magnetism. 
Magnetism
‚Ä¢ 
The magnetic properties of nuclei were not well understood by Sir 
,VDDF1HZWRQ5LWWHUDQG6LU:LOOLDP+HUVFKHODQGZHQWODUJHO\
unaddressed during the development of optical spectroscopy

magnetic properties that can be used to discern one from another in 
a given molecule.
‚Ä¢ 
Atomic nuclei have a property that physicists call magnetic 
‚Äúspin‚Äù‚Äîa term that does not actually refer to the rate of rotation, as 
one might assume from classical mechanics. Certain atomic nuclei

saying that there are two possible magnetic states. Such nuclei 
contain what is known as a magnetic dipole, or a magnetization that 
can behave much like an atom-sized bar magnet or compass needle.

which they reside, leading to a distribution of these two states in  
the population.
‚Ä¢ 
But the energies of the parallel state (called the alpha spin state) 
and the antiparallel alignment (called the beta spin state) differ by 
an amount that can be calculated and is referred to as the Zeeman 
splitting energy, which is a function of the intensity of the external 
PDJQHWLF¬øHOGDQGDQLQWULQVLFSURSHUW\RIWKHQXFOHXVFDOOHGWKH
gyromagnetic ratio. All protons in the universe have the exact same 
gyromagnetic ratio. 
‚Ä¢ 
So, for a nucleus of a given type, the stronger the external magnetic

states will be. 
Continuous Wave Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
‚Ä¢ 
Early spectrometers consisted of a powerful electromagnet, a radio 
frequency transmitter, and a radio frequency receiver. A sample of

The current to the electromagnet is slowly increased as the exiting

the radio wave will be absorbed in the spin state transition from 
alpha to beta, manifesting itself as a reduced radio wave intensity 
at the receiver. This is the basic design of a continuous wave  
NMR spectrometer.

an NMR experiment is uniform, then how is it that this technology 
is good for anything other than simply detecting the presence of 
protons? How can it possibly distinguish one proton from another? 
The answer to this very important question lies in a different term in 
WKH=HHPDQVSOLWWLQJHTXDWLRQ,WLVQRWWKHJ\URPDJQHWLFUDWLRWKDW
differs from one proton to the next but, rather, the exact strength of 
WKHH[WHUQDO¬øHOGDWHDFKQXFOHXV
‚Ä¢ 
The key to understanding how NMR gives us information lies in 
another phenomenon‚Äîmagnetic shielding by electrons. Electron 
clouds have this interesting ability to attenuate, or weaken, the

nucleus, whereas a proton closer to an electron-withdrawing atom 
is expected to have less electron density around itself. 
‚Ä¢ 
Reduced shielding means that we need to apply a less-powerful

its peak to shift within the NMR spectrum. This phenomenon is 
called chemical shift.

of proton NMR, we use a compound called tetramethylsilane (TMS). 
We use this compound because the very low electronegativity of

So, parts per million (ppm) has become the standard unit of  
NMR spectroscopy.
Magnetic Coupling
‚Ä¢ 
How would we expect a continuous wave NMR spectrum to look for 
a compound that has more than one kind of proton? Let‚Äôs consider 
this using a fairly simple organic compound, ethyl chloride, which 
has two chemically distinct types of protons: those on the carbon 
bearing the electron-withdrawing chlorine and those one carbon-
carbon bond away.
‚Ä¢ 
We expect the former to be more deshielded than the latter, 
producing a spectrum with two different absorptions: one at about 
3.5 ppm and one at about 1.5 ppm. This is, in fact, what we see. 
But if we look closer, we see that the peak at 3.5 ppm appears to 
actually have four distinct lobes and the peak at 1.5 has three. 
‚Ä¢ 
This is a phenomenon known as spin-spin coupling, a mechanism 
through which magnetization from one neighboring proton is 
encoded on the other. This phenomenon is most obvious when the 
coupled hydrogens are three bonds away from one another and 
only takes place when the chemical shifts of the coupled protons  
are different.
‚Ä¢ 
NMR spectroscopists are familiar with the patterns produced by the 
interplay of nuclei close to one another in a molecule and look for 
distinctive patters that help them identify not only the presence, but 
also the location of groups within a molecule.
Exchangeable Protons
‚Ä¢ 
More than any other element, hydrogen atoms (or protons) tend to 
exchange between molecules. For example, the acid proton of a 
carboxylic acid is very labile, potentially protonating molecules of 
solvent or even other carboxylic acid molecules in the sample. This 

230
Lecture 30: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
transition between and among different chemical states can occur 
on the timescale of an NMR experiment, which usually takes a few 
seconds to complete, leading to a ‚Äúblurring‚Äù of the chemical shift 
associated with that proton.
‚Ä¢ 
A collection of molecules with protons interchanging very slowly 
will produce spectra with sharp lines for each type of proton, but 
as their exchange rate increases, the signals coalesce and blur. 
This explains why protons bonded to nitrogen and oxygen have 
a tendency to appear at many different chemical shifts and with 
broader absorption peaks than usual.
‚Ä¢ 
This sort of behavior is very common for acid, alcohol, and amine 
protons, and it explains why their approximate chemical shifts are 
so widely varied in shift tables.

Pulsed NMR

Several advances in technology have led to the development of the 
pulsed, or Fourier-transform, NMR technique. First and foremost 
LV WKH GHYHORSPHQW RI VXSHUFRQGXFWRUV $OO PRGHUQ KLJK¬øHOG
spectrometers use a superconducting magnet to generate extremely 
KLJKDSSOLHG¬øHOGVWRDFKLHYHEHWWHUUHVROXWLRQ
‚Ä¢ 
Keeping these superconducting magnets cold is critical to their 
function, so spectrometers contain a series of concentric vacuum-

liquid nitrogen and an interior dewar containing liquid helium and 
the superconducting magnet. The liquid helium keeps the magnet 
at 4 kelvins‚Äîcolder than the dark side of the Moon‚Äîwhile just 
inches away from it is the sample at room temperature.
‚Ä¢ 
The second advancement that opened the door to the pulsed NMR 
method is computing technology. The detector in NMR is more 
often called a receiver because the response that it creates is not a 
spectrum but, rather, a raw data set that must be manipulated by the 
computer before it can be used.

Larmor frequency for a given proton using the same equation,

But it would be a decade after R√∂ntgen‚Äôs Nobel Prize that one of 
the most impactful applications of his X-rays would be developed. 
English physicist Sir William Lawrence Bragg, working in 
collaboration with his father, opened up this entirely new part of 
the electromagnetic spectrum to the art of identifying organic 
molecules when he developed a technique to elucidate the structure 
of crystalline materials using X-rays.

had a peculiar effect on X-rays as they interacted. There is a

As he continued his research into subatomic particles, he turned 
his attention to the nucleus of the atom, seeking any clue of the 
existence of subatomic particles there. He found what he was

What he saw was remarkable: Two different spots formed on the 
developed paper. Thompson had observed neon atoms behaving 
as if they had two different masses. He had proven the existence 
of elemental isotopes‚Äîatoms of the same element with different 
molecular masses. The only logical explanation for his observation 
was that atomic nuclei are made up of something smaller

so many molecules share the same molecular mass? The answer 
lies in a phenomenon that takes place during the ionization process.
‚Ä¢ 
During the high-energy process of ionization, many of the ionized 
organic compounds fragment into smaller pieces. Usually, this 
involves the homolytic cleavage of a bond to form two pieces of the 
original molecule‚Äîone neutral radical and one cation. 
‚Ä¢ 
The mass spectrum not only gives us the mass of the molecule 
by detecting its molecular ion, but also produces a sophisticated

By measuring the mass difference between the molecular ion 
and its fragments, we can determine the identity of the fragment 
that was lost to produce each fragment. Not the molecular mass, 
but the fragmentation pattern is the key to much of the utility 
of this technique.

the unfortunate decision to eat a poppy seed bagel before a 
urinalysis drug screening only to be told afterward that he or she

by popular programs like MythBusters and has been parodied on

spectroscopy and spectrometry in general. 
‚Ä¢

two acetyl groups. These acetyl groups are added to the naturally

reason for this is hidden in the Gibbs free energy of crystals. Crystals

But organic molecules can also achieve these highly repeating 
patterns in the solid state. When they do so, the intermolecular 
attractions between and among molecules become stronger, and the 
free energy of the system naturally decreases. Because lower-energy

‚Ä¢ 
Let‚Äôs use a compound called phthalic acid to better understand the 
process of crystallization. We start with a sample of phthalic acid 
and a beaker of water in which we can dissolve the phthalic acid.

not going to spontaneously rearrange in the solid phase, expelling 
the contaminants, so we want to speed up the process.

241
‚Ä¢ 
We need to disassemble the crystals at the molecular level, 
separating them all in such a way that the phthalic acid molecules 
get a second chance to order themselves in a more stable state. 
One way to accomplish this separation is to dissolve the crystals, 
separating them all with solvent.
‚Ä¢ 
We can create a saturated solution of phthalic acid in boiling water. 
At the beginning, the phthalic acid has no incentive to precipitate, 
because it is happy staying dissolved in the hot solution. But then, 
we turn off the heat source.
‚Ä¢ 
As the solution cools slowly, the solubility of the phthalic acid 
drops dramatically. Then, the organics have nowhere to go but out 
of solution. The key here is that we are allowing the process to 
happen slowly. By cooling slowly, we avoid the trapping of impure 
molecules in the growing crystals. 
‚Ä¢ 
At the completion of the recrystallization, the large, well-formed, 
pure phthalic acid crystals can simply be removed from solution

Pure crystals tend to be more stable than their impure counterparts. 
This phenomenon can be used to purify a compound by crystallizing 
it from a solution, but we can also exploit this phenomenon in a 
completely different way‚Äîby observing the melting behavior of a 
sample to help us identify it and assess its purity.
‚Ä¢ 
Just as dissolution involves liberating individual molecules from 
one another by solvation, melting liberates them by heating them

take the diagram for a pure substance, which we will call substance

with boundaries for melting and freezing, boiling and condensing, 
and sublimation and deposition.
‚Ä¢ 
However, the diagram only applies to a pure substance. To create 
a binary phase diagram, we settle on a constant pressure like 1 
atmosphere, and at that pressure, we project the diagram along a 
third axis of composition. We do this for two hypothetical solids, 
which we will call A and B, focusing on the melting transition.
‚Ä¢ 
The new [-axis is the mole percentage of one of the two compounds, 
so the extremes of the axis correspond to pure materials, and 
the interior corresponds to mixtures of the two in various ratios. 
The melting process for most mixtures occurs over a range of 
temperatures rather than a single, distinct temperature. 

243
‚Ä¢ 
The lower temperature barrier for melting is called the solidus. At 
temperatures below the solidus for a given mixture, no liquid can 
coexist at equilibrium. The higher temperature barrier is called the 
liquidus, and it represents the temperature above which only liquid 
can exist at equilibrium. 
‚Ä¢ 
This diagram will allow us to predict the melting behavior of 
our system as a function of its composition at 1 atmosphere of 
pressure. The melting points of pure A and B are just that‚Äîpoints 
of a single temperature at which the solidus and liquidus converge. 
After all, we learn in general chemistry that the melting of a

VSHFL¬øFWHPSHUDWXUH
‚Ä¢ 
But let‚Äôs consider what happens when we mix a bit of compound 
B into the solid sample of A‚Äîjust about 5 mole percent. At this 
composition, the presence of a few molecules of impurity B are 
disrupting the crystals of A, reducing its melting point. 
‚Ä¢ 
But there is even more going on here. The temperatures at which 
solid and liquid can coexist are now a range, rather than a single 
temperature. This is because a process called incongruent melting 
is taking place.
‚Ä¢ 
,QFRQJUXHQW PHOWLQJ PHDQV WKDW WKH OLTXLG JHQHUDWHG ¬øUVW LV QRW
of the same composition as the solid. So, the liquid is more 
concentrated in B than in the solid, meaning that the melting point 
of the crystal increases as it melts, although it never quite reaches 
the melting point of the pure solid.
‚Ä¢ 
As we continue to add more and more compound B to the solid and 
repeat the experiment, we see the trend of melting point depression 
and broadening continue, until eventually the gap narrows again 
and comes to a point at a local minimum on the solidus.

Vapor Pressure
‚Ä¢ 
All liquids exist naturally in equilibrium with just a bit of their 
vapor, even at temperatures well below their boiling points. The 
exact amount of vapor varies from substance to substance and 
depends on how well molecules of the same kind stick together 
through intermolecular attractions. 
‚Ä¢ 
We measure the amount of vapor above a liquid in terms of the 
pressure that it exerts, so this property of liquids has come to be 
known as vapor pressure. The higher the vapor pressure of a given 
liquid, the faster and more easily it will convert to the gas phase. 
We often report vapor pressures in units of torr. One torr is equal to 
1 mm of mercury in a barometer. 
‚Ä¢ 
,QFUHDVLQJ WKH WHPSHUDWXUH RI D VDPSOH PHDQV LQFUHDVLQJ WKH
kinetic energy in the molecules making it up. So, increasing the 
temperature of a liquid sample gives more of its molecules enough 
kinetic energy to escape the liquid and become a gas. This increases 
the vapor pressure of the sample.

247
‚Ä¢ 
When a liquid is heated to a temperature at which its vapor pressure 
is equal to the externally applied pressure, such as the 760 torr of 
pressure exerted by the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, the liquid boils. When 
the pressure we are working against is 1 atmosphere, we refer to 
this temperature as the normal boiling point.

Raoult‚Äôs law, named for French chemist Fran√ßois-Marie Raoult, 
states that the vapor pressure exerted by a component in a mixture 
of miscible liquids is equal to its vapor pressure when pure 
PXOWLSOLHGE\LWVPROHIUDFWLRQLQWKHPL[WXUH,QRWKHUZRUGVWKH
vapor pressure of each component is proportional to the fraction of 
sample molecules it makes up. 
‚Ä¢ 
Dalton‚Äôs law, named for John Dalton, tells us that the sum of the 
partial vapor pressures exerted by all of the components of such a 
V\VWHPLVHTXDOWRWKHWRWDOYDSRUSUHVVXUHH[HUWHGE\WKDWV\VWHP,Q
other words, vapor pressures are additive. So, varying the amount 
of each liquid making up the mixture can alter its vapor pressure.
‚Ä¢ 
The ideal gas law is actually a combination of several laws, relating 
pressure, volume, abundance, and temperature through a constant 
called the ideal gas constant. The equation for the ideal gas law is 
PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is the volume occupied by the 
gas, n is the number of moles of gas, T is the temperature of the 
vapor, and R is the ideal gas constant. Because R is constant for 
all systems, we can assert that PVnT for any gas or collection of 
gasses should always be equal.
‚Ä¢ 
The ratio of the partial pressure of a gas to the total pressure must be 
equal to its mole fraction in the sample. The vapor above miscible 
mixtures of liquids is more enriched in the more volatile component

problem with this approach is that it is very labor- and energy-

run again. 
‚Ä¢ 
Neither of these options is particularly attractive, especially when 
there is an easier way‚Äîa technique known as fractional distillation. 
A fractional still differs from a simple still in just one crucial way:

‚Ä¢ 
The ultimate effect of all this is that a single distillation runs with 
JUHDWHUHI¬øFLHQF\WKDQDVLPSOHVWLOOFDQDFKLHYH,IWKHGLVWLOODWH
is as pure as that obtained by two simple distillations, we say that 
the still runs at two theoretical plates. This is a reference to early 
fractionating column designs, which actually contained plates along 
the length of the column, on which one cycle of condensation and 
vaporization could take place before the vapor moved on to the 
next-highest plate.

249
Azeotropes
‚Ä¢ 
As powerful as distillation is as a technique, it does suffer from 
limitations. For example, grain alcohol is 190 proof‚Äîmeaning 
that the mixture is 95% ethanol and 5% water by volume‚Äînot 200 
proof, or 100% alcohol for a very good reason: Ethanol and water 
cannot be distilled beyond this proportion.
‚Ä¢ 
Raoult‚Äôs law, Dalton‚Äôs law, and the ideal gas law are predictions 
based on ideal behavior, in which gas molecules do not interact 
ZLWK RQH DQRWKHU VLJQL¬øFDQWO\ 7KH WUXWK LV RIWHQ TXLWH GLIIHUHQW
from this. Because these laws are not rigorously accurate models, 
we often see distortions in the behavior of systems that we are 
trying to distill. 
‚Ä¢ 
The mixture of ethanol and water is actually a rather mild example 
of this. The liquid-vapor phase diagram for this system has a small 
ORFDOPLQLPXPDWDERXWHWKDQRO,WORRNVDORWOLNHWKHHXWHFWLF
point, which is the only composition at which the liquid and solid 
are of the same composition.

250
Lecture 33: Purifying by Distillation
‚Ä¢ 
When the analogous feature is seen in a liquid-vapor system, we 
call the mixture an azeotrope, derived from Greek terms meaning 
¬≥QRFKDQJHRQERLOLQJ¬¥,WLVDYHU\DSSURSULDWHQDPHEHFDXVHWKH
vapor above the liquid is of exactly the same composition as that 
liquid, making distillation of such a mixture futile.

A fractionating column that reaches the Moon would not be 
VXI¬øFLHQWWRREWDLQSXUHHWKDQROE\GLVWLOODWLRQ:HZRXOGKDYHWR
resort to other means to chemically dry the azeotrope and make 
it 100% ethanol. From the perspective of an alcoholic beverage 
company, it simply isn‚Äôt worth all of the extra effort to remove that 
last little bit of water from a product that is most likely going to 
be mixed right back in with another aqueous solution to prepare  
a drink.
Advanced Distillations
‚Ä¢ 
Since a century or two ago, many additional methods for distillation 
have been developed to create new spins based on this old 
technique. While the simple and fractional distillation techniques 
are designed to carefully coax one volatile organic away from 
another, there are situations in which we can be a bit more heavy-
handed. An example is the rotary evaporator.
‚Ä¢ 
For example, let‚Äôs say that we want to recover a nonvolatile solute 
from solution, such as nonvolatile dye molecules dissolved in a 
sample of acetone. Essentially, one of our two components has no 
YDSRUSUHVVXUHZKDWVRHYHU,QWKLVVLWXDWLRQZHZDQWWRXVHDV\VWHP
that can quickly and quantitatively distill away all of the volatile 
material, leaving behind only the nonvolatile dye molecules.
‚Ä¢ 
Another potential sticking point when designing a distillation 
is how to distill a material that is known to decompose before it 
reaches its normal boiling point. This can be accomplished in a 
number of ways, but when the desired compound is immiscible 
with water, chemists often turn to the technique of steam distillation 
to get the job done.

251
‚Ä¢ 
Take the example of eugenol, which is the primary component of 
the essential oil of cloves and is prized for its anesthetic properties 
DQG DV D √ÄDYRULQJ DJHQW %XW LW KDV D YHU\ ORZ YDSRU SUHVVXUH
giving it a normal boiling point of about 254¬∞ Celsius. Such a 
KLJKERLOLQJSRLQWPDNHVHXJHQRODSRRUFDQGLGDWHIRUSXUL¬øFDWLRQ 
by distillation.
‚Ä¢ 
However, there is one critical property of eugenol that we have 
QRW \HW FRQVLGHUHG ,W LV LPPLVFLEOH ZLWK ZDWHU 7KLV PHDQV WKDW
Raoult‚Äôs law does not apply to a mixture of eugenol and water. 
,QVWHDGZDWHUDQGHXJHQROZLOOHDFKHVWDEOLVKWKHLUYDSRUSUHVVXUH
independently of their mole fraction in a mixture.
‚Ä¢ 
At 100¬∞ Celsius, eugenol has a vapor pressure of about 4 torr. This 
means that in the presence of boiling water, eugenol will only make 
up about 0.5 mole percent of the molecules in the vapor phase.
‚Ä¢ 
This might seem like a hopeless endeavor, creating a vapor that is 
only 1 part eugenol and 199 parts water. But keep in mind that this 
approximation is a mole percentage and not a mass percentage. We 
can easily convert it into mass percentage, multiplying by the molar 
mass of eugenol and dividing by the molar mass of water.
‚Ä¢ 
This leads us to the conclusion that the vapor above a mixture 
of boiling eugenol and water will actually have 4 mass percent 
eugenol‚Äîstill a small amount, but not nearly as disappointing as 
our mole percentage made it seem.
‚Ä¢ 
So, by boiling whole cloves in water, we can generate a vapor that 
is 4% eugenol in water at a very safe 100¬∞ Celsius. Collecting this 
vapor using a West condenser gives us a mixture of eugenol and 
water, which are easily separated because they are not miscible.
‚Ä¢ 
What makes steam distillation particularly useful in situations 
like this is that the steam need not be exactly 100¬∞ Celsius. More 
complex systems can be set up to introduce steam of varying 

252

temperatures, allowing us to maximize the yield of oils without 
losing product to degradation. This technique is very commonly 
used to extract oils like that of the clove plant because they tend to 
be low-volatility, water-immiscible materials.

as a very effective tool for isolation of nonvolatile organic compounds in a 
process known as liquid-liquid extraction.
Partitioning in the Laboratory
‚Ä¢ 
The contents of a bottle of salad dressing include water and olive 
oil. We can see these two ingredients because they create two 
distinct phases. Because the oil and 
water are immiscible, one simply

oil above the water. Also in the bottle 
are salt and some herbs. To simplify, 
the recipe contains just those four 
components: water and oil as solvents 
and salt and oregano oil as solutes.
‚Ä¢ 
The water and oil provide two different 
chemical environments in which the 
sodium and chloride ions from the 
salt and the organic carvacrol from the 
oregano can dissolve. Knowing what 
we know about intermolecular forces 
and the role they play in solubility,

bond dipoles to create favorable interactions with the dissolved 
ions. The low-polarity carvacrol from the herb oils dissolves in 
the low-polarity oil layer on top, because the larger oil molecules 
are more polarizable and can form dispersion forces that solvate  
the carvacrol.

separate, dispensing each individually‚Äîwe are doing a very simple 
form of liquid-liquid extraction.

in one of the two phases available to it. We were able to make this 
assumption because of how drastically different sodium chloride 
and carvacrol are, being ionic and organic, respectively.
‚Ä¢ 
But the truth for most organic molecules in a system like this is 
not so simple. Many of them have an appreciable solubility in both 
water and a certain organic solvent. When this is the case, we can 
expect a solute to establish a set of equilibrium concentrations in 
both solvents based on its solubility in each.
‚Ä¢ 
This effect is called partitioning, and the equilibrium constant

FRHI¬øFLHQWVDUHHDVLO\FDOFXODWHGIURPWKHPD[LPXPVROXELOLW\RI
the solute in each of the two solvents. They give a numerical value 
that allows us to predict how much of each solute will be in each 
layer at equilibrium.

255
Effect of pH on Partitioning
‚Ä¢ 
Compounds of varying solubilities can be concentrated or reduced 
in samples with a well thought-out liquid-liquid extraction. But 
there is a very powerful trick that we have not yet considered‚Äîthat 
many organic compounds are titratable, meaning that they can be 
ionized by protonation or deprotonation in suitably strong acid or 
base, respectively.
‚Ä¢ 
Partitioning depends on relative solubility of the solute in each 
solvent, so if we can change the solubility of the compound in 
RQHOD\HUZHFDQFKDQJHWKHSDUWLWLRQLQJFRHI¬øFLHQW7KHNH\WR
understanding acid‚Äìbase extraction is to recognize that when 
ionized, organic compounds tend to strongly favor dissolution in 
aqueous media because of its high polarity.
‚Ä¢ 
/HW¬∂VWKLQNDERXWDVLPSOHRUJDQLFDFLGZLWKWKHIRUPXOD+$,WV
acid dissociation reaction is governed by the equilibrium constant 
Ka for this compound. An expression that relates the ionization state 
of the compound to the ratio between the dissociation constant Ka 
and the proton concentration in the water is Ka = [H+][A√≠@>+$@
‚Ä¢ 
The Henderson-Hasselbach equation relates the ratio of acid and 
conjugate base through the difference in pKa and pH: pH = pKa + 
log10([A√≠@>+$@8VLQJWKLVUHODWLRQVKLSZHFDQJHQHUDWHDSORWRI
the percent ionized in water as a function of pH.
‚Ä¢ 
The logarithmic relationship leads to a situation in which the acid is 
99% in its neutral protonated form when the pH is two units lower 
than its pKa. Conversely, it is 99% in its charged conjugate base 
form when the pH is two units higher than its pKa.
‚Ä¢ 
This means that we can maximize its partitioning into an organic 
phase by lowering the pH of the aqueous phase using a strong 
mineral acid, or we can maximize its partitioning into the aqueous 
phase by raising its pH using a base.

256
Lecture 34: Purifying by Extraction
‚Ä¢ 
For example, let‚Äôs say we have phenol, a weak organic acid with 
a pKaRIDERXWWKDWFDQGHSURWRQDWHWREHFRPHSKHQRODWH,IZH
were to mix a solution of phenol in ether with an aqueous solution

LQWKHRUJDQLFOD\HURUQHXWUDOLQWKHDTXHRXVOD\HU,WZLOOSUHIHUWKH
organic layer.
‚Ä¢ 
But if instead we use an aqueous solution at pH 12, the phenol has 
a choice between being neutral in the organic layer or a being a 
charged phenolate in the aqueous layer. This time, the aqueous layer 
competes much better for the solute, and the partitioning behavior 
of that solute changes.
Acid‚ÄìBase Extractions
‚Ä¢ 
7KHHIIHFWRIDOWHULQJWKHS+LQDQH[WUDFWLRQFDQEHVLJQL¬øFDQWDQG
is fairly predictable, allowing us to tune an extraction to our liking 
in many cases. Let‚Äôs again take the example of phenol, but this time 
let‚Äôs assume that we need to separate a sample of phenol from a 
physical mixture containing benzoic acid. Both are similar aromatic 
compounds with similar polarities.
‚Ä¢ 
,I ZH ZHUH WR GLVVROYH WKH PL[WXUH LQ HWKHU DQG WKHQ DWWHPSW DQ
extraction with an aqueous solution at pH 2, because we are below 
the pKa of both compounds, we expect them each to preferentially 
accumulate in the ether layer. The separation is not optimized.
‚Ä¢ 
But say that we instead buffer the aqueous layer to a pH of 7. This 
time, we are three units above the pKa of benzoic acid but three 
units below that of phenol. We are in a range of the Henderson-
Hasselbach plot, which shows that benzoic acid will dissolve in the 
aqueous as benzoate, but the phenol will have to be neutral. So, 
the benzoic acid is expected to partition into the aqueous layer to a 
much greater extent.

257
‚Ä¢ 
Finally, let‚Äôs consider what would happen if the aqueous layer were 
pH 12. We are now well above the pKa of both compounds, meaning 
that not only can benzoic acid dissolve in the aqueous layer as its 
charged conjugate base, but so can phenol. Both compounds prefer 
the aqueous layer, and the separation will again suffer.
‚Ä¢ 
So, the selection of an aqueous layer pH must be carefully 
considered when attempting to isolate titratable organic compounds 
from one another.
‚Ä¢ 
Yet another consideration comes up when dealing with organic 
bases, such as aniline. Aniline is an aromatic amine, which is in fact 
basic. As a base, its conjugate acid is anilinium ion, which has a pKa 
of about 5.
‚Ä¢ 
But because aniline is a base, its conjugate acid will be charged, 
meaning that its Henderson-Hasselbach plot will be inverted on the

,IZHZHUHWRLQVWHDGQHHGWRVHSDUDWHWKLVEDVHIURPSKHQROWKH
effect of this on pH selection is dramatic.
‚Ä¢ 
We now must use an aqueous layer with a pH less than 3 or higher 
than 12 to reach a position in which one of the two components 
ionizes well in water. So, the drawback to separating acids from 
EDVHVLVWKDWZHPXVWXVHH[WUHPHS+FRQGLWLRQVEXWWKHEHQH¬øW
is that we now get to choose which compound accumulates in the 
aqueous layer and which accumulates in the organic layer.
Extraction from Solids
‚Ä¢ 
Partitioning can take place between any two distinct phases, not just 
two immiscible liquid phases. Some other examples are solid-liquid 
or liquid-gas systems. So, naturally, it should be possible to conduct 
extractions using such systems as well.

258
Lecture 34: Purifying by Extraction
‚Ä¢ 
Probably the most obvious example of an extraction using  
solid-liquid partitioning is the process of brewing a cup of tea. 
As we add hot water to a 
tea leaf, certain compounds 
dissolve into the water better 
than others. The large and 
insoluble material making up 
the tea leaves can interact with 
the 
caffeine, 
polyphenols, 
and other compounds that 
would otherwise be soluble in  
cold water. 
‚Ä¢ 
However, steeping tea in cold 
water leads to a very weak 
solution. So, just as we can 
manipulate the partitioning

extraction with pH, we can 
manipulate the partitioning 
FRHI¬øFLHQW RI D FRPSRXQG LQ
a solid-liquid system using 
temperature. 
‚Ä¢ 
Green tea is famous for its 
GHOLFDWH√ÄDYRUVDQGDURPDVEXWLWDOVRFRQWDLQVSDUWLFXODUO\KLJK
levels of tannins, a polyphenolic compound with a bitter taste and 
dry mouthfeel. So, the goal when preparing this delightful beverage 
is temperature control.
‚Ä¢ 
Fine green teas require careful attention to brewing temperature, 
because water just below boiling partitions the pleasant and aroma-
giving compounds into the water effectively‚Äîbut water too close 
to boiling will separate the polyphenolic compounds that have a 
more bitter taste, ruining the otherwise enjoyable experience of a 
well-crafted green tea.
We can manipulate the partitioning

in solid-liquid systems using 
temperature; tea connoisseurs will 
understand this well.

up the discussion to one of the most powerful separation techniques ever

us to isolate almost anything we can imagine. From recrystallization, to 
distillation, to liquid extractions, to chromatography, there is a solution for 
nearly any separation problem that can come up in the lab.
Chromatography
‚Ä¢ 
Mikhail Tsvet, the inventor of chromatography, was educated in 
Switzerland, where he received his Ph.D. in 1896. Shortly after this, 
however, he found himself in Russia, where his foreign credential 
nearly marginalized him. Tsvet‚Äôs non-Russian credential was 
not recognized by the national establishment, prompting him to

plant pigment chlorophyll that he made the observation that would 
forever change his life and the science of separations.
‚Ä¢ 
Tsvet knew that isolated chlorophyll could be easily dissolved in 
an organic solvent known as petroleum ether. However, when he 
attempted to extract the pigments from the leaves of plants, he 
QRWHGWKDWLWZDVYHU\GLI¬øFXOWWRGLVVROYH(YHQDIWHUJULQGLQJDQG
tearing the leaves to expose more surface area and break open cells, 
the distinctive, dark green pigment simply wouldn‚Äôt cooperate.

261
‚Ä¢ 
His conclusion was that the chlorophyll pigment must be adhered 
to the solid plant matter through intermolecular forces, reducing 
its solubility in the solvent. Using this idea as a springboard for 
his research, Tsvet tried adhering chlorophyll to different solid 
surfaces, then washing it away with various solvents by allowing 
WKRVHVROYHQWVWR√ÄRZWKURXJKWKHVROLGPDWUL[
‚Ä¢ 
He found that not only did chlorophyll migrate at different rates 
in different systems, but also that mixtures of pigments would 
many times separate in space because of the differing attractive 
forces at work between them and the two phases. This created an 
array of colors on Tsvet‚Äôs column, prompting him to call his new 
technique chromatography, from the Greek words meaning ‚Äúcolor‚Äù  
and ‚Äúwriting.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
Where Tsvet‚Äôs creation really differed from simple liquid-liquid or 
solid-liquid extraction is that he added motion to the equation. By 
allowing one of the phases to move across the other, the partitioning 
of a solute between heterogeneous phases can be used to move 
compounds across the stationary phase at varying rates. The more 
time a particular compound spends partitioned into the mobile 
phase, the faster it moves.
Thin-Layer Chromatography and Paper Chromatography

Chromatography has advanced considerably over the past century. 
Stationary phases like calcium carbonate and sugar from Tsvet‚Äôs 
experiments have been replaced by a number of superior options.

As the mobile phase wicks up through the plate by capillary action, 
the different compounds in the sample move at different rates. 
Compounds that interact more strongly with the polar silica move 

263
a shorter distance, while those that interact better with the lower-
polarity mobile phase move a greater distance.
‚Ä¢ 
At the completion of the experiment, we measure the distance 
traveled by the sample spot as a fraction of the distance traveled by 
the mobile phase and report this number as the retention factor (Rf) 
value for that sample in that particular system. This value gives us a 
semiquantitative way to describe simple chromatographic mobility.
Column Chromatography
‚Ä¢ 
Thin-layer chromatography may be a versatile, quick, low-cost 
way to observe the chromatographic mobility of a compound, 
but working with such small quantities makes collection of a

the thin layer of stationary phase on a backing for a column. 
Bringing the third dimension into play means that a 2-centimeter-
wide column can separate about 8000 times as much sample as a 
TLC lane 200 microns thick.

SLHFHRIJODVVZRRODQG¬øOOHGZLWKVDQGWRSURYLGHDOHYHOOD\HURQWR
which we can build a column of silica that is then saturated with the 
mobile phase.
‚Ä¢ 
Then, we drain the mobile phase through the stopcock to expose 
the top of the column and gently add a narrow, concentrated band 
of the compound we want to analyze. We then drain that to get 
it in contact with the silica gel before topping it off with more  
mobile phase.

264
Lecture 35: Purifying by Chromatography
‚Ä¢ 
After loading the column, we can open the stopcock and let it run. 
As the mobile phase moves downward under the force of gravity, 
the compounds again separate, but this time in large enough quantity 
that we can collect a band consisting of just one component. This 
fraction is now ready to be worked with. We can recover the solute 
by rotary evaporation, liquid extraction, or another technique, and

explosion of advancements, leading to techniques involving 
ultramicroscopic silica particles with such small pores that powerful 
pumps must be used to push solvent through them at high pressure 
in a technique called high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC).
‚Ä¢ 
The extremely high surface area of the HPLC column packing 
allows very precise separations, but it also requires a closed 
system consisting of a steel column to be used so that it can resist 
the pressure applied by the pumps. So, it is impossible to load 
compounds in the same way as traditional chromatography, because 
the system is sealed. Similarly, it is impossible to see even colored 
compounds as they move through the system.
‚Ä¢ 
The loading problem is solved with a device called an injection 
loop, which consists of a manifold with two separate loops made 
of a pressure-resistant tubing. When the valve handle is rotated, one

with a special injection septum.
‚Ä¢ 
The sample is pushed into the open loop using a syringe, and then the 
handle is turned, placing the injection loop in line with the mobile 
phase, thereby introducing the sample into the chromatographic 
system without ever opening it and losing pressure.

265
‚Ä¢ 
Because columns need to be packed into stainless steel cases, it 
becomes impossible to monitor a run with our eyes, even if our 
compounds are visible. So, HPLC systems also have a detecting 
system that is usually something like a simple spectrophotometer

passes through the eluting solvent, striking a detector.

As the sample molecules move out of the column and through the

of time, starting with the injection of the sample at zero minutes, 
we can create what is called a chromatogram, or a graphical 
representation of the separation taking place.
Gas Chromatography
‚Ä¢ 
There are many more chromatographic methods available to the 
modern chemist, including gas chromatography (GC). Archer J. P. 
Martin is the name most commonly associated with the invention 
of GC. Martin is actually most famous for his invention of paper 
chromatography, the technique used by Stanley Miller to detect the 
amino acids in his primordial concoction in Harold Urey‚Äôs lab.

phase more quickly if the gas phase were somehow included  
in the experiment.

266
Lecture 35: Purifying by Chromatography
‚Ä¢ 
Martin wondered whether a form of chromatography could be 
developed using liquid as the stationary phase and gas as the mobile 
phase. His idea proved viable. He demonstrated that separation 
could be accomplished with extreme speed and precision using 
a dense liquid phase and a gas like helium as the mobile phase.

His new method allowed faster separation with far less material 
and has become a staple technique in forensic and analytical labs 
all around the world. Using various detection methods, GC can be 
used to analyze practically anything that will vaporize.

it was witnessed, so there is no debating its extraterrestrial origins;

that the meteorite contained thousands or even tens of thousands of 
different small organic molecules encased within. The implication 
is that just like the meteorite, which is unquestionably an authentic 
space rock, those molecules that were trapped within its matrix 
must have fallen from space. 
‚Ä¢ 
Even more tantalizing evidence of extraterrestrial organics has 
been collected in recent decades as organizations like NASA 
launch sophisticated probes and telescopes like the Spitzer Space

the 21st century. Spitzer found not only evidence of carbon, but 
VSHFL¬øFDOO\RIsp3-hybridized carbon. 
Chirality
‚Ä¢ 
Another curiosity that scientists are still trying to address is that all 
life on Earth that we know of uses l-amino acids, or left-handed 
amino acids, as the principle constituent of the proteins of life. That 
means that even though we may think of ourselves as being achiral 
at the macroscopic level, we are in fact not symmetrical when we 
look at ourselves through molecular eyes. At the molecular level, 
we are chiral.
‚Ä¢ 
However, every reliable source of data on abiologically synthesized 
organics suggests that racemic mixtures of these compounds 
are created in natural processes. This leads us to two important 
questions. First, why l-amino acids? The molecular machinery 
that our bodies use to create the proteins and enzymes we need 
to live are chiral themselves, so it makes sense that we should 
use all of one handed amino acid or the other. So, clearly, nature 
had to make a choice early on: left-handed biochemistry or  
right-handed biochemistry?
‚Ä¢ 
But is there any real difference between our biochemical world and 
LWV PLUURU LPDJH" ,V WKHUH VRPH TXDQWXP PHFKDQLFDO HIIHFW WKDW
we do not understand perfectly that dictated that choice, or was it 
just a cosmic coin toss that led us to be composed of l-amino acids 
instead of d-amino acids?

Lecture 36: The Future of Organic Chemistry

chemical activity of the right-handed protein was identical in every 
way to its left-handed version.
‚Ä¢ 
This closed the book on the question of handedness in the chemistry 
of life. Racemic sources of material that led to our left-handed 
biochemistry should be equally capable of seeding right-handed 
biochemistry. So, if we ever do make contact with extraterrestrial, 
carbon-based life-forms, it would appear that there is a 50% chance

Kent‚Äôs research opened up a whole new vein of inquiry. Now that 
we know that d-amino acids can be used to create enzymes with 
every bit as much power to promote highly specialized chemistry, 
researchers are trying to develop new therapeutics made from 
d-amino acids.
Biomimetic Chemistry

When humans sought to take

wings were an obvious inspiration 
for the design of early aircraft. 
Scientists call this kind of design 
strategy‚Äîone of observing the 
properties of natural systems and 
applying them to engineering‚Äî
biomimicry. 
‚Ä¢ 
Similarly, as we learn more and 
more about the biomolecular 
world, 
scientists 
more 
often 
turn to the biological for inspiration in their designs of useful 
compounds. This practice of imitating the function of biological

molecules is called biomimetic chemistry, and it may provide the 
springboard that we need to create small molecules with the exact 
chemical properties that we need to accomplish a number of tasks.
‚Ä¢ 
Researchers at the University of Leeds have successfully synthesized 
what they call porphyrin cored hyperbranched polymers, which 
have oxygen-binding properties similar to hemoglobin but can be 
easily created in a lab. Someday, compounds like this one might 
offer a non-biological oxygen carrier for use in medical applications

in the cells that had accepted the transplant without compromising 
the viability of the cells.
‚Ä¢ 
So, the genetic deck was stacked in favor of success in this 
experiment. Still, this achievement will no doubt take us to the next 
level of biomolecular engineering, as it demonstrates clearly and 
effectively that the molecular machinery of life is modular and can 
be transplanted from one cell to another. 
‚Ä¢ 
This experiment shows that with enough understanding and 
cautious, dedicated effort, genetic material and the cellular 
machinery that uses it can be mixed, matched, and altered to

entire cells from chemicals on a lab bench using organic reactions 
that are available to us today.
Carbon Sequestration
‚Ä¢ 
Carbon-containing compounds contain a great deal of chemical 
energy, and whether we are burning fuels or using foods for 
respiration, a large amount of the organic material in the world is 
GHVWLQHGWREHFRPHFDUERQGLR[LGH,QDGGLWLRQZKHQKXPDQVDQG
other creatures are done with their biomass for good, decomposition 
naturally releases much of their carbon as CO2.
‚Ä¢ 
Carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, absorbing radiated heat 
from the Earth‚Äôs surface, leading to climate change when it is not 
properly balanced. This has led to a global movement to devise 
ways to store and use carbon dioxide in ways that prevent its release 
into the atmosphere. 
‚Ä¢ 
For example, the U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that 
2.4 billion metric tons of industrially produced CO2 could be 
stored by injecting it into subsurface structures like un-minable 
coal seams, where it can become adsorbed to the surface of the  
underground carbon.
‚Ä¢ 
The concern is that there are other gasses already bound to the coal 
in seams like these, most notably methane. Those who advocate 
this method are betting on irreversible binding of carbon dioxide 
to subsurface structures like the carbon-rich coal deposits of coal 
seams‚Äîbinding so strong that it can displace methane.
‚Ä¢ 
There‚Äôs a good chance that such an idea would work, but it depends 
on how well each environmental gas adsorbs to the stationary coal 
SKDVHUHODWLYHWRLWVWHQGHQF\WRYDSRUL]H,QFRPSOH[JHRORJLFDO
systems like these, the overall composition and chemical behavior 
of formations can be tricky to predict, so we won‚Äôt know the best 
method for sequestering CO2 until we try and see the results.

273
Molecular Engineering
‚Ä¢ 
When we have completely exhausted the ability of our planet to 
provide for us, even with some assistance from science, the natural 
next step is that we look beyond the Earth for places to live, 
continue to expand our knowledge, and carry our species into the 
reaches of the solar system‚Äîand eventually the cosmos.
‚Ä¢ 
To do so, at least to get started, will require that we take with us 
everything and everyone that a colony might need to get to and 
survive on a new celestial body. But that leads to a number of 
logistical questions, including how to get that much material off of 
the Earth and into space. With current rocket technology, it costs 
thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to get just one pound 
of material into orbit around the Earth.

a cost-effective way to escape the gravity of Earth. One very 
interesting proposal is the construction of a so-called space elevator, 
which would consist of a line that reaches from the equator of the 
Earth to an altitude of about 36,000 kilometers, the altitude at which 
a geostationary orbit is obtained.
‚Ä¢ 
,WLVXQOLNHO\WKDWDQ\VXFKVWUXFWXUHFRXOGVXSSRUWLWVRZQZHLJKW
One proposed solution to this problem is to use a structure that is 
supported not by compression, but by tension‚Äîconstructing a 
cable with a counterweight reaching so far into space that its center 
of mass is above 36,000 kilometers and whose overall length is 
100,000 kilometers so that it is held taut under its own momentum 
as it turns with the Earth.
‚Ä¢ 
Using a cable like this, a mechanical climber could simply move up 
the cable, taking its payload of people and supplies to the necessary 
altitude to escape Earth‚Äôs gravity and reach outer space. Estimates 
are that a device like this, though profoundly expensive to build, 
once operating could lower the cost of delivering material into 
space by more than tenfold.

Under one proposal, nanotubes several meters in length could be

human history and providing us with the cable needed to make the 
space elevator a reality.

Researchers have reported that they have managed to create single 
nanotubes with lengths approaching the necessary mark needed 
to form the proposed cable. So, it would seem that soon the only 
thing standing in the way of a space elevator will be our own 
imagination‚Äîand about $20 billion.
