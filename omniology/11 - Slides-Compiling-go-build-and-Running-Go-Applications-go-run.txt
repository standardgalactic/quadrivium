Compiling (go build) and Running Go Applications (go run)
go is a tool for managing Go source code.
1. go run: it compiles and runs the application. It doesn’t produce an executable
●
go run ﬁle.go compiles and immediately runs Go programs. 
2. go build: it just compiles the application. It produces an executable
●
go build ﬁle.go compiles a bunch of Go source ﬁles. It compiles packages and 
dependencies.  
●
If you run go build it will  compile the ﬁles in the current directory and will produce an 
executable ﬁle with the name of the current working directory.
●
go build -o app will produce an executable ﬁle called app

Compiling (go build) and Running Go Applications (go run)
Compiling for Windows: GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o winapp.exe
Compiling for Linux: GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o linuxapp
Compiling for Mac: GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o macapp
3. go install
●
Both go install and go build will compile the package in the current directory.
●
If the package is main, go build will place the resulting executable in the current directory 
and go install will move the executable to GOPATH/bin
●
When running go install you use paths relative to GOPATH/src
