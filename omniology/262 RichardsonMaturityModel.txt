Steps Towards the Glory of REST

Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)
• Established by Leonard Richardson in a 2008 Q-Con 
Presentation 
• A model used to describe the maturity of RESTful 
services 
• Unlike SOAP, there is no formal speciﬁcation for REST 
• RMM is used to describe the quality of the RESTful 
service

RMM Levels
Level 0: The Swap of POX
Level 1: Resources
Level 2: HTTP Verbs
Level 3: Hypermedia Controls

Core Technologies
URI
HTTP
HYPERMEDIA

Level 0: Swamp of POX
• POX - Plain Old XML 
• Uses implementing protocol as a transport protocol 
• Typically uses one URI and one kind of method 
• Examples - RPC, SOAP, XML-RPC

Level 1: Resources
• Uses Multiple URIs to identify speciﬁc resources 
• Examples: 
• http://www.example.com/product/1234 
• http://www.example.com/product/5687 
• Still uses a single method (ie GET)

Level 2: HTTP Verbs
• HTTP Verbs are used with URIs for desired actions 
• Examples: 
• GET /products/1234 - to return data for product 1234 
• PUT /products/1234 (with XML body) to update data for 
product 1234 
• DELETE /products/1234 to delete product 1234 
• Most common in practical use

Level 3: Hypermedia
• Representation now contains URIs which may be useful 
to consumers 
• Helps client developers explore the resource 
• No clear standard at this time 
• Spring provides an implementation of HATEOS

Summary
• Level 1 - breaks large service into distinct URIs 
• Level 2 - Introduces Verbs to implement actions 
• Level 3 - provides discoverability, making the API more 
self documenting
