Preface
There is growing awareness that nuclear energy is needed to complement 
intermittent energy sources and to avoid pollution from fossil fuels. Light 
water reactors are complex, expensive, and vulnerable to core melt, steam 
explosions, and hydrogen explosions, so better technology is needed. 
Thorium energy and molten salt reactors could make nuclear energy safer 
and less expensive.
The book “Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy” (Elsevier 
2017) has served as a reference for engineers and scientists. Since then, 
nuclear power has become more accepted, and there is growing interest 
in molten salt reactors. Therefore, a Second Edition has been prepared. 
The volume of information is so large that we have split off the 25 coun- 
try/organization reports into this separate volume, entitled “Global 
Progress on Molten Salt Reactors”. In this companion volume 3 chapters 
are completely new, 10 have substantial revisions, 7 have minor revisions, 
and 4 chapters are picked up from the First Edition. We look forward to 
more updates in the years to come.

MSR activities in Canada are concentrated in the Integral Molten Salt 
Reactor (IMSR), which is a uranium-fueled, graphite-moderated, fluoride 
chemistry, thermal spectrum molten salt reactor system designed by 
Terrestrial Energy Incorporated. It is described in Chapter 18 Integral molten 
salt reactor of “Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy” (Elsevier 2023), 
and also in the following site.

CHAPTER 2
Czech Republic
Jan Uhlir
Research Centre Rez, Husinec, Czech Republic
The technology of nuclear reactor systems with liquid molten salt fuel has 
been investigated in the Czech Republic since 1999. The original effort 
came from the national partitioning and transmutation concept based on 
the subcritical accelerator-driven system for the incineration of transura­
nium elements with liquid fluoride fuel and fluoride pyrochemical parti­
tioning fuel cycle technology. After 2005, the original R&D intentions 
were gradually converted to a classical molten salt reactor technology and 
to the thorium—uranium fuel cycle. Arguments for this decision were 
presented by a group of prominent Czech nuclear scientists. These argu­
ments were based on the fact that the Czech Republic should support the 
development of a technology that can minimize environmental impact of 
nuclear power, save natural resources, and has a potential to be deployed 
also in nonsuperpower countries, whereas fast reactors, which need highly 
enriched uranium or a high plutonium content, will represent the future 
of nuclear power for superpowers.
The theoretical and experimental development of MSR and liquid tho­
rium fuel technology has been realized by a national consortium of institu­
tions and companies originally led by the Nuclear Research Institute Rez.
After the first R&D activities in 2000—03, devoted mainly to subcriti- 
cal molten salt system for incineration of transuranium elements, since 
2004, the main R&D effort has been focused on critical MSR systems; 
and since 2005, the thorium—uranium fuel cycle technology has also 
been under intensive study.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic supported 
two important R&D projects devoted to MSR system and 
thorium—uranium fuel cycle. The first, which was opened in 2004, was 
called “Nuclear system SPHINX with molten fluoride salts based liquid 
nuclear fuel,” the second, opened in 2006, was “Fluoride reprocessing of 
GEN IV reactor fuels.” The investigations were based on experience 
obtained by US Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the Molten-Salt

Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Reactor Experiment project in 1960s (Rosenthal et al., 1971) and also 
from the exchange of scientific information with the French EDF team 
on the AMSTER project in 2000 (Vergnes et al., 2000).
The SPHINX project was devoted to the broad spectrum of the MSR 
technology covering theoretical and experimental activities in MSR physics, 
fuel salt and fuel cycle chemistry, molten salt thermohydraulics, structural 
material development, and testing of apparatuses for molten fluoride salt 
media. The project was carried out by a consortium of institutions and 
companies lead by the Nuclear Research Institute Rez in cooperation with 
SKODA JS (SKODA—Nuclear Machinery), Nuclear Physics Institute of 
the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Faculty of Nuclear 
Sciences and Physical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in 
Prague and Energovyzkum Ltd. Brno, and later also with the Research 
Centre Rez and COMTES FHT. The mam aims of the project were to 
contribute to the knowledge of MSR reactor physics, core design and 
safety, structural material development, MSR fuel cycle technology; to ver­
ify experimentally selected important areas of MSR technology; and to 
contribute to the solution of existing bottlenecks. The research work under 
the SPHINX project was divided into following work packages:
1. WP1—MSR core and primary circuit;
2. WP2—MSR fuel cycle technology;
3. WP3—experimental MSR core and its control system;
4. WP4—secondary circuit and its components;
5. WP5—structural materials for MSR technology;
6. WP6—system study of MSR-SPHINX;
7. WP7—experimental program SR-0.
The second project “Fluoride reprocessing” was devoted to the exper­
imental development of two fluoride partitioning technologies, specifically 
to the fluoride volatility method and to electrochemical separation pro­
cesses from fluoride molten salt media. As the fluoride volatility method 
can be used for oxide fuels from fast reactors, the investigation of electro­
chemical separation processes has been exclusively devoted to the thor- 
ium—uranium fuel cycle of the molten salt reactor system. The work 
within this project also covered the experimental verification of fresh liq­
uid molten salt fuel processing—a technology of ThF4 and UF4 prepara­
tion from ThO2 and UO2, respectively, and final processing of MSR fuel 
salts LiF-BeF2-ThF4 and LiF-BeF2-UF4. Other objectives of the MSR 
fuel cycle investigation were system studies focused on the material bal­
ance calculations and a conceptual flow-sheet design of MSR on-line

reprocessing. Both one-fluid (single-fluid) and two-fluid (double-fluid) 
systems of MSR core design were investigated, and conceptual flow­
sheets were designed for both design systems. Finally, the project also cov­
ered the nonproliferation and physical protection aspects of Th-U MSR 
fuel cycle technology.
Although the MSR design and operation were already verified by 
ORNL in the 1960s, the on-line reprocessing was never fully realized and 
still represents a crucial problem of MSR technology, which must be 
solved before MSRs can be deployed in the future. The “Fluoride repro­
cessing project was solved by the Nuclear Research Institute Rez.
The main achievements of both projects were:
1. Challenging reactor physics experiments with inserted molten salt 
zones were realized in LR - 0 and LVR -15 and VR-1 reactors at the 
Nuclear Research Institute Rez, the Research Centre Rez, and the 
Czech Technical University.
2. Computer codes for calculation of neutronic characteristic of the 
MSR system and for calculation of the composition evolution during 
the burnout of liquid fuel were developed.
3. In the Fluorine chemistry laboratory of the Nuclear Research Institute 
Rez, handling with beryllium-contammg molten salts was mastered, 
fresh thorium and uranium molten salt fuel processing for MSR sys­
tems was verified in semipilot conditions, and the basic studies of elec­
trochemical separation of actinides (Th, U) from fission products were 
realized. These electrochemical studies were devoted to MSR on-line 
reprocessing development.
4. MSR fuel cycle mass balance calculations and conceptual flow-sheets 
of on-line reprocessing were designed.
5. A special nickel alloy called MONICR, resistant to molten fluoride

salt media, was developed by SKODA JS and COMTES FHT compa­
nies. Irradiation and corrosion tests of the MONICR alloy and metal­
lographic studies were performed and experimental production of 
sheets, tubes, and rods was realized.
6. Basic design and theoretical and experimental development of impel­
lers and valves for molten fluoride salts and “salt/salt” and “salt/air” 
heat exchangers were realized by the Energovyzkum Ltd.
7. Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering of the Czech 
Technical University in Prague opened new facultative topics “Liquid

The LR-0 reactor, operated by the Research Centre Rez, has proved 
to be extremely suitable equipment for measurement of molten salt neu- 
tronics. The measurements were realized in molten salt zones inserted in 
the central part of the reactor core. The standard VVER fuel served as the 
neutron driver (Fig. 2.1). Basic critical parameters (the critical height of 
the moderator, the moderator level coefficient) were determined for each 
arrangement using the approved methodology of the initial critical experi­
ments for the LR-0 reactor. These, along with a description of the fuel 
quantity, enrichment, and filling material, represent the fundamental data 
needed to determine the effects of the filling on the physical properties of 
the core, and serve as the input for calculations and benchmark compari­
sons. The initial critical experiments were followed by measurements of 
neutron flux and reaction rate to determine the characteristics of the neu­
tron and photon field using the following methods. The increase in reac­
tivity was determined by differences in the critical moderator level with 
and without the salt (Hron and Matal, 2008; Frybort and Vocka, 2009).
The theoretical and experimental investigations of MSR fuel cycle 
technology at the Nuclear Research Institute Rez have been focused 
mainly on the electrochemical separation processes in fluoride media 
suitable for usage within the MSR on-line reprocessing technology.

The main objective of experimental activities on electrochemical separa­
tion technology has been to survey the separation possibilities of the 
selected actinides (uranium, thorium) and fission products (lanthanides) in 
selected fluoride melt carriers. The cyclic voltammetry method was used 
to study the basic electrochemical properties.
The first step was the choice of fluoride melts suitable for electro­
chemical separations. The melt should meet some basic characteristics— 
low melting point, high solubility, high electrochemical stability, and 
appropriate physical properties (electrical conductivity, viscosity, etc.). 
A special reference electrode based on the Ni/Ni21 red-ox couple was 
developed to provide reproducible electrochemical measurements in fluo­
ride melts (Straka et al., 2009, 2011) and to facilitate the on-line reproces­
sing flow-sheet design (Uhlir et al., 2012a).
Results obtained from the measurements were interpreted in fol­
lowing way:
1. In FLIBE melt, there is a good possibility for electrochemical separa­
tion of uranium. Although the electrochemical studies of protactinium 
have not been realized yet, based on the thermodynamical properties 
of PaF4, there is a presumption that protactinium could be separated 
from this melt as well.
2. In FLINAK and in LiF-CaF2 melts, both uranium and thorium and most 
of the fission products (lanthanides) can be electrochemically separated.
The national projects described above were successfully finalized in 
2009 (SPHINX) and 2012 (Fluoride reprocessing) (Hron et al., 2009; 
Uhlff et al., 2012b). The main goals were achieved in both projects, and 
the obtained knowledge and experience created a good basis for interna­
tional collaboration of Czech companies in further collaborative R&D 
projects of MSR technology. In 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
of the Czech Republic and US Department of Energy concluded a 
Memorandum of Understanding focused on the collaborative investiga­
tion of the fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) and mol­
ten salt reactor technologies. Current Czech activities in this field cover 
mainly the areas of:
1. theoretical and experimental reactor physics of MSR and FHR;
2. chemistry and chemical technology of MSR;
3. further development of nickel alloys for molten fluoride salt technologies;
4. development of equipment and components for MSR/FHR technology.
These areas were also solved within the last project entitled "R&D of 
Fluoride-cooled Nuclear Reactor Systems," which was completed in 2021

Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
(Marecek et al., 2021). The project was carried out by a consortium of insti­
tutions and companies managed by Research Centre Rez in cooperation 
with UJV Rez (Nuclear Research Institute), COMTES FHT, MICo Ltd, 
and SKODA JS. The project was financed by the Technology Agency of the 
Czech Republic and supervised by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
One of the main objectives of the project in the area of reactor physics 
was to measure the neutronic characteristics of the fluoride salt FLIBE 
(7LiF—BeF2) over the operating temperature range of the MSR and FHR 
reactors (500°C—750°C) in order to determine the reactivity coefficients kef 
(Losa et al., 2020). For these experiments, a so-called “Hot FLIBE Inserted 
Zone” was constructed. The measurements were carried out in the experi­
mental LR-0 reactor of the Research Centre Rez. Because the LR-0 reactor 
did not allow heating of the “Zone” inside the reactor vessel, the “Zone” 
was preheated outside the reactor before each experiment (Fig. 2.2).

In the field of chemistry and chemical technology of MSR, in addition 
to the technology of electroseparation, the technology of uranium 
removal from FLIBE salt using the “Fused salt volatilization method” was 
also studied (Straka et al., 2019). In the field of further development of 
nickel alloy MONICR, the problems of its welding, high-temperature 
microstructure stability, high-temperature mechanical stability, and radia­
tion embrittlement were addressed.
In the area of component development, flange and gasket designs 
were tested and the development of impeller pumps for fluoride salts was 
underway. The project also included a loop program to test the design 
and operation of freeze valves (Fig. 2.3).
Czech activity in R&D of MSR technology has also enabled individual 
Czech research teams to participate in several international projects devoted 
to MSR technology (MOST, ALISIA, EVOL and SAMOSAFER projects 
of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Framework Programme and Horizon 2020 
Programme of EC-EURATOM, selected CRP projects of IAEA, and stud­
ies of OECD-NEA). Czech representatives also participate in the work of 
Provisional System Steering Committee of MSR System of the Generation 
Four International Forum under the membership of the EURATOM team.

International Thorium Molten-Salt Forum, Yokohama, Japan
After ORNL in the United States stopped the operation of their experi­
mental MSR (MSRE: Molten Salt Reactor Experiment) in 1969, China 
started an MSR project in 1970. A major institution in China was the 
Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP); and in 1971, they con­
structed a first zero-powered experimental reactor using frozen salt. 
However, this history has not been known outside China for long time, 
and it gave a surprise to Western countries when they told this history in an 
international conference (Xu, 2012). In 2011, SINAP started a long-term 
development program for their Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR), 
which is described later.
Besides the study in SINAP, Tsinghua University in Beijing investigated 
molten salt application to nuclear energy at Institute of Nuclear Energy 
Technology (INET) in the 1970s. They have made various studies, and 
one of them was a molten salt loop using HTS (nitrate) with 8 m3/h flow 
by a pump, operated by a 100kWe heater at 550°C (Yoshioka, 1999).
In the 2011 development program for TMSR, SINAP started a wide 
range of studies in parallel (Xu, 2013). These are material development 
such as molten salt, Nickel-based super-alloy, graphite, and enriched 7Li. 
Components such as pumps, valves, and reactor vessel have also been devel­
oped. In order to establish offline reprocessing, which is a separate facility 
from TMSR, SINAP is developing dry-processing technology based on the 
previous study in ORNL.
Meanwhile, they constructed a non-nuclear MSR mockup facility in 
the SINAP campus. It has a 370 kWe electric heater in a core with molten 
FLiNaK salt with a flow rate of 3.9 kg/s (ca. 6 m3/h) at 600°C—650°C. Its 
heat is transferred to secondary molten salt through a heat exchanger and 
finally to open air through a heat exchanger, as is shown in Fig. 3.1. This 
figure is drawn by the author, based on literature (Dai et al., 2016; Zou, 
2019). This facility was to be completed around 2019, and its construction 
experience was applied to the next stage described later.

A first Chinese experimental MSR (TMSR-LF1) is being constructed 
at Wuwei in Gansu Province. It was originally planned to be completed 
in 2020—21, but due to Covid-19 influence, it is delayed. Table 3.1 
shows its design parameters (Chen et al., 2020). Its thermal power is 2 
MWt, which is 1/4 of MSRE design value in ORNL. Its initial fuel is 
based on LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 same as MSRE. As an initial fissile material, 
HALEU (High Assay Low Enriched Uranium) is adopted, but thorium 
(Th) addition is planned. Its graphite design is not shown here, but 
another report (Dai et al., 2016) says it is a rectangular block, and that its 
graphite fraction is 84%, similar to MSRE.
Fig. 3.2 shows a plant concept of TMSR-LF1, which is shown in a 
licensing report (SINAP, 2019). This design follows MSRE design, but it 
adopts an integrated design, where a fuel salt loop pump and its heat 
exchanger are enclosed in a main vessel. Its core heat is transferred to cool­
ant salt through a heat exchanger and finally to open air through another 
heat exchanger, same as MSRE design. One more difference from MSRE 
is a passive heat removal system for accident situations.
Next stage is a demonstration reactor around 2030. Based on the litera­
tures up to 2022 (Dai et al., 2016; Xu, 2012; Zou, 2022), its plant size is

(Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)) in the book 
of “Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy”, it is not repeated here.
Meanwhile in 2018, they started to investigate another possibility of a 
microsized MSR, such as 60 MWe with 150 MWt (Xu, 2018).

4.1 Technical University of Denmark
Bent Lauritzen, DTU Physics
Neutronics research at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) is 
currently concentrated within three areas:
1. 
development of neutron transport codes in support of neutron scatter­
ing research (McStas, MCPL, NCrystal),
2. 
neutronics design of nuclear instruments, detectors, and sources, con­
tributing to the design of large-scale facilities, in particular the 
European Spallation Source (ESS) target monolith and the ESS suite 
of scattering instruments, and
3. reactor physics, with the focus on MSR development.
Within neutronics R&D, DTU is engaged in a number of collabora­
tive projects with both public and private entities including the ESS, 
Fusion for Energy, and the Danish nuclear startup Seaborg Technologies. 
In 2020, DTU joined with observer statues the EURATOM-supported 
SAMOSAFER project, aimed at establishing the safety case for MSFRs.
In recent and current MSR projects, DTU has investigated various 
neutronics-thermal hydraulics coupling schemes applicable to fluid-fueled 
reactors (Nalbandyan et al., 2019; Groth-Jensen et al., 2021). In the 
generic design of the MSR, the fuel is dissolved in the coolant salt result­

strong (negative) thermal reactivity feedback, but further complicated by 
the transport of delayed neutron precursors out of the reactor core. The 
EU Horizon 2020-supported SEALION project aimed at developing reg­
ulatory compliant multiphysics software, based upon both open-source 
and restricted software single physics codes and intended to demonstrate 
the safety of MSR designs and eventually to ease the licensing process for 
such reactors. Within the SAMOSAFER project, DTU contributes to 
investigations of fuel confinement and the generic design of freeze valves 
for MSRs.
Within materials science, DTU is collaborating with the Seaborg 
Technologies on testing structural materials for MSRs. The focus of investiga­
tion is high-temperature corrosion of, for example, nickel- or zirconium-based 
alloys exposed to various molten hydroxide or fluoride salts.
4.2 Seaborg technologies ApS—compact molten salt 
reactor power barge
Seaborg Technologies ApS Troels Schonfeldt, CEO, Seaborg Technologies
Seaborg is a fast-growing Danish company developing a novel nuclear 
reactor (the Compact Molten Salt Reactor—CMSR). Seaborg was 
founded in 2016 by reactor and particle physicists from The Niels Bohr 
Institute, Paul Scherrer Institute, Danish Technical University, and 
CERN, combining traditional and novel computational methods for con­
ceptualizing next-generation nuclear reactors. The company employee 
headcount is 100 today, including researchers (physics, chemistry, engi­
neering, and business) from five continents.
The CMSR is a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) in which the fuel, 
which also functions as the primary coolant, is molten fluoride salt. The 
CMSR is integrated into a floating nonself-propelled Power Barge (cov­
ering the phase to decommissioning life cycle). The CMSR is a funda­
mentally different type of SMR that generates 250 MWth/100 MWe. 
A single Power Barge can integrate several CMSRs resulting in electrical 
power outputs of 200/400/600/800 MWe. The CMSR is remarkably 
innovative yet simple: inherently safe, lowering considerably capital costs, 
reducing time of construction/deployment by using a novel maritime 
approach, and achieving a very small resource footprint.
The company is focused on the reactor core and primary circuit—its 
expertise—and is dedicated to commercializing the CMSR. The excel­
lence of the team is seen in the knowledge generated.

Seaborg already holds a key patent on the moderator (NaOH). This 
patented moderator allows for a truly compact reactor. The patent is 
being globalized putting Seaborg in a very strong position. Furthermore, 
Seaborg has been a pioneer in using modern supercomputers, state-of- 
the-art modeling as well as code development (See also Chapter 22, 
Generation IV International Forum).
4.3 Copenhagen atomics
Thomas Jam Pedersen, cofounder, Copenhagen Atomics
Copenhagen Atomics (CA) is developing a Heavy Water Moderated 
Molten Salt Reactor design, which improves neutron economy and uses 
LWR fuel recycling in a thermal spectrum MSR design. The goal is to 
develop this into a breeder reactor, which can be mass manufactured. CA 
has significant intellectual property rights in reactor design and compo­
nents such as pumps and valves. CA has collaboration with Alfa Laval and 
KSB and other leading industry players. Based on an open-source philoso­
phy, where publishing of results and collaboration with other teams are 
encouraged, over the years, CA has created a strong collaboration with 
other players from North America and Europe. In 2021 CA has 15 mol­
ten salt test loops, 30 static molten salt systems and is constructing a non­
fission prototype of the first reactor. Copenhagen Atomics has already 
completed 25 years of accumulated testing of components for the first 
reactor. The team had 50 1 people and was expected to reach 100 peo­
ple by 2023. CA expects to start the first 1 MW test reactor in 2025 and 
have commercial reactors based on the thorium fuel cycle online in 2028. 
Copenhagen Atomics does not expect to start the first reactors in 
Denmark. (See also Chapter 21, Venezuelan contribution to AD MSR 
development).

5.1 Brief history
Since the ORNL experiments and projects on MSR, various studies on this 
kind of reactors were resumed in the 1980s in the world, including in 
France, with studies on the MSBR by EDF and the CEA. In the 1990s, the 
concept was taken up again with a view to burning nuclear wastes in subcrit- 
ical reactors such as the TIER-1 project or in critical reactors such as the 
CEA TASSE project or the EDF AMSTER project (Lecarpentier, 2001).
5.2 Development of the molten salt fast reactor concept
In France, CNRS has been involved in molten salt reactors since 1997, 
initially through the legal obligation imposed at CNRS to have research

activities on systems able to reduce the wastes of the nuclear industry (loi 
Bataille of 1991 extended by the law of June 28, 2006). The Thorium 
fuel cycle, as for MSRs, was also seen as too immature industrially and 
not necessary compared with the classic U/Pu fuel cycle already in place 
in PWRs. However, since only two fuel cycles exist on Earth (only two 
fertile materials being naturally available: 232Th and 238U), researchers at 
CNRS/IN2P3 decided also to work on this topic.
The CNRS researchers first reevaluated the Oak-Ridge National 
Laboratory Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project using a probabilistic neu­
tron code and an in-house evolution code for materials (REM) both 
being coupled (Nuttin et al., 2005).
To solve the issues of the MSBR project (positive void coefficient, 
molten salt reprocessing, and graphite management), an innovative con­
cept called Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) initially based on the 
Thorium fuel cycle was proposed by CNRS/IN2P3 (Allibert et al., 2016; 
Mathieu et al., 2009; 2009a,b, 2011, 2012, 2013; Rouch et al., 2014). 
The primary feature of the MSFR concept is the removal of the graphite 
moderator from the core, resulting in a breeder reactor operated in the 
thorium fuel cycle. The use of a fast neutron spectrum allows, in addition, 
access to actinide burning and a strong reduction in neutron capture by 
fission products, which makes fuel reprocessing very light (reprocessing of 
less than 0.1% of the total volume of fuel each day). This “reference 
MSFR” (large power reactor of 3 thermal GW operated in the Th fuel 
cycle and using a fluoride salt) is listed in the official ARIS (Advanced 
Reactors Information System) database of IAEA. This concept results 
from extensive parametric studies in which various core arrangements, 
reprocessing performances, and salt compositions were investigated with a 
view to the deployment of a thorium-based reactor fleet on a worldwide 
scale. Systematic studies of MSRs have been undertaken at LPSC/IN2P3/ 
CNRS in Grenoble to optimize an MSR in the framework of the 
deployment of a Gen4 concept, first regarding neutronics and then 
including reactor physics, thermalhydraulics, chemistry, materials, and 
safety.
In 2008, the Generation IV International Forum selected for further 
studies on Molten Salt reactors (MSR) the concept of Molten Salt Fast 
Reactor (MSFR) that has been recognized as a long-term alternative to 
solid-fueled fast neutron systems with a unique potential (excellent safety 
coefficients, smaller fissile inventory, no need for criticality reserve, simpli­
fied fuel cycle...) (Boussier et al., 2012; GIF, 2008; Renault et al., 2009;

France
21
Serp et al., 2014). Since then, this “reference MSFR” concept proposed 
by CNRS has been the center of various national and European projects 
such as the EVOL (FP7), SAMOFAR, and SAMOSAFER (H2020) 
projects.
These research activities have been supported by several French inter­
disciplinary programs involving public laboratories and private companies: 
the former PACEN and present NEEDS national programs, as well as 
local support in Grenoble and direct industry supports in the 2000s, for 
example, by EDF, Rhodia/Solvay, and AREVA through the funding of 
PhD theses.
5.3 Main studies at CNRS on the “reference molten salt fast 
reactor” concept
The research activities cover reactor physics including neutronics, physics 
coupling and transient calculations, experimental molten salt chemistry, 
risk analysis and evaluation, decay heat calculation, structural material cor­
rosion, plant design, and experimental technology for molten salt. CNRS 
studies on MSR are performed topics listed in the paragraphs below, 
mainly by numerical modeling and simulation approaches together with 
experiments mainly on the chemical questions. The CNRS/IN2P3 
research activities are thus supported by the development of innovative 
simulation codes and by experimental facilities, both dedicated to MSR 
technology. Some of the developed codes (REM, TFM-OpenFOAM, 
LiCore-ALICES) are quite unique in the world, simulating MSRs requir­
ing usually codes more generic, and can be applied on solid fuel reactors. 
Moreover, these codes have been validated for years by code-to-code 
comparisons and also on experimental data when available (TFM code).
5.3.1 Neutronic calculations of material composition, nuclei 
evolution, and burnup associated with MSRs
The MSFR team based at the CNRS/LPSC laboratory of Grenoble is 
developing, updating, and validating the REM neutronic code for more 
than 20 years (Doligez et al., 2014; Merle-Lucotte et al., 2010). REM is a 
code of evolution under constraints, which can be used to simulate the 
composition evolution of the materials under neutron irradiation in any 
kind of nuclear system, including molten salt reactors where the fuel 
cleaning (fission product extraction) and feeding (addition of fertile or fis­
sile matter) are done during the reactor operation. This code remains 

22
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
quite unique in the world in its neutron-chemistry coupling capabilities 
and also the only one to allow the setting of several parameters during the 
evolution (reactivity, power, proportion of given elements). The REM 
code has been used to perform various MSR studies and optimizations of 
the MSFR concept based on the evolution of material composition dur­
ing irradiation or in storage, including burnup studies of different kinds of 
MSFR (fluoride and chlorides salts, fast to thermal spectrum, and versions 
of MSRs as breeders and actinide burners using a cycle based on Th-233U 
(Heuer et al., 2014) and based on 238U-Pu).
A neutronic benchmark (Brovchenko et al., 2019) has been carried 
out in the frame of the EVOL European project. These burnup calcula­
tions have been used for applications such as proliferation evaluations 
(Allibert et al., 2020; Ignatiev et al., 2018) and radioprotection issues in 
the frame of the work-package 5 of the SAMOFAR project between 
IPN Orsay, LPSC, and CEA/IRFU. A new neutronic benchmark is 
under working in the frame of the current SAMOSAFER, led by 
CNRS/Subatech with contributions of different partners (Paul Scherrer 
Institut, Politecnico di Milano, CEA, CNRS/LPSC, and Subatech) aim­
ing at providing the MSFR term source that can be released in the envi­
ronment by the reactor in case of severe accident.
In perspective, an adapted version of the Serpent code for MSR is 
foreseen at the SUBATECH laboratory, together with studies and optimi­
zations of different kinds of MSRs (fluoride and chlorides salts, fast and 
thermal spectrum, a fuel cycle based on Th/233U or on 238U/Pu, and 
MSR versions for burning actinides).
5.3.2 Nuclear data related to decay heat and neutron cross 
sections, uncertainty propagation, and assimilation based on 
Monte Carlo approach
Some dedicated studies were performed at CNRS/Subatech to evaluate 
the decay heat produced by a MSFR and to assess the potential needs of 
new nuclear data for such a Generation IV concept. Some work just 
started (2020—24) in uncertainty calculations of the MSFR’s decay heat, 
especially to determine the impact of nuclear decay data by using an 
approach based on the Total Monte Carlo (TMC) method with the 
development of the Cocodrilo code coupled to the SERPENT code, 
which may be used for different concepts. Another new code named 
Coconust focuses on the neutron cross section sampling for uncertainty 
propagation and assimilation as studied in (Heuer et al., 2017).

5.3.3 Chemical experiments on molten salts
Chemical experiments on molten salts are carried out on fluoride melts to 
document the pyrochemical extraction of soluble fission products. The 
chemistry of ThF4 was studied in LiF-CaF2 molten salt, and diffusion 
coefficients and activity coefficients were determined. These values were 
compared with those determined previously in LiF-ThF4 (Soucek et al., 
2021).
5.3.4 Simulation studies during normal and accident 
conditions
Important aspects of such systems regarding the coupling are the delayed 
neutron precursor convection and a complex flow pattern in the core cav­
ity. Two simulation tools have been developed by CNRS for MSRs that 
account for the specificities of a circulating liquid fuel, namely:
1. The LiCore power plant simulator for real-time simulation under 
development by CNRS and the CORYS company (Laureau et al., 
2020).
2. The TFM-OpenFOAM coupled code: this multiphysics tool, which is 
more generic than those existing for reactors with solid fuel, has been 
developed by coupling CFD thermalhydraulics and an innovative 
green function neutronic approach based on Monte Carlo calculations 
called Transient Fission Matrix (TFM) method (Laureau, 2015; 
Laureau et al., 2015a,b) invented at CNRS/IN2P3. Various MSFR 
transient studies have already been calculated with the TFM- 
OpenFOAM code (Laureau et al., 2017a,b,c,d,e), and a collaboration 
is developed with Framatome to include the TFM method in the 
StarCCM 1 code. Finally, the TFM-OpenFOAM code developed 
initially for MSFR studies was also used for PWR calculations 
(Laureau, 2015) and more recently was extended to perform transient 
calculations of sodium fast reactors (Laureau et al., 2017a,b,c,d) or of 
research reactors (Blaise et al., 2019).
5.3.5 Safety approach and risk analysis
Safety analysis has also been carried out at a very early stage on the “theo­
retical reactor” MSFR in order to detect as early as possible any safety 
constraint before looking at technological options. A safety analysis meth­
odology for such a reactor with circulating liquid fuel has been developed 
in collaboration with IRSN, Framatome, and POLITO in the

24
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
SAMOFAR and then the SAMOSAFER European projects of the 
H2020 program, including now also CEA and Politecnico di Milano. 
This approach is based on the Integrated Safety Assessment Methodology 
(ISAM) developed by the Risk and Safety Working Group of the 
Generation IV International Forum (GIF, 2011), coupled to usual risk 
analysis methods such as functional method analysis, master logic diagram, 
and line of defense method (Beils et al., 2019; Gerardin et al., 2018, 
2019; Uggenti et al., 2017). This assessment methodology aims at reach­
ing a safety that is “built-in” and not “added-on” by applying it at the 
earliest stages of design.
5.3.6 MSR system design optimization and preconceptual 
design studies
The static system SONGe (System OptimizatioN by Genetics/Systeme 
d'Optimisation Numerique par algorithme Genetique) code developed at 
LPSC is focused on the MSFR’s fuel circuit and connected to genetic 
algorithms. This code allows optimization studies of this circuit. The 
objective is to obtain a globally optimized geometry of the fuel circuit by 
setting different parameters and constraints, instead of separately optimiz­
ing the various components (such as heat exchangers and pipes). This is 
mandatory since some constraints cover several components (for example, 
the fuel salt—coolant volume). A configuration that best satisfies these 
constraints can then be sought by adjusting a list of variable design 
parameters.
In the frame of the EVOL, SAMOFAR, and SAMOSAFER 
European projects and in collaboration between CNRS and Framatome 
and now also CEA, preconceptual design activities are also carried out on 
the MSFR concept, based on the functions to be performed by the com­
ponents with no precise drawings. Several simplified designs of the 
3 GWth reference MSFR were proposed during the EVOL and 
SAMOFAR European projects in order to integrate qualitative and quan­
titative studies related to safety analysis. Safety analysis of the functional 
design of the fuel circuit was conducted, and the results were used to pro­
pose changes to eliminate or reduce the consequences of accidents for 
each design option. This continuous process is ongoing to achieve safety 
by design, and its advancement depends on the sophistication of the avail­
able numerical modeling.

5.3.7 Deployment scenario studies
Finally, the ISF (Innovative Scenarios for the Future) code has been 
developed at LPSC in parallel to the REM code to study nuclear deploy­
ment scenarios including molten salt reactors. ISF is a simulation program 
for the deployment of electro-nuclear energy developed in the DALI 
environment in the context of the study of molten salt reactors. The 
DALI code development environment is a toolbox in C language devel­
oped at CNRS/LPSC for more than 20 years. These tools are grouped in 
the form of DALI modules, one of which is the ISF code and another 
one is the REM (neutronic evolving under constraints) code. A scenario 
is defined by its start and end dates, a monitoring step for the evolution of 
the reactor fleet (generally taken as one year), a list of reactor types classi­
fied by decreasing order of priority at start-up with their enrichment and/ 
or reprocessing units, reserves or stocks of certain materials shared by the 
reactors that can be modified by these units, and energy objectives by 
monitoring step. A type of reactor is defined by a name, a power, an ini­
tial commissioning date for the concerned reactor, a load factor, a lifetime, 
and the materials consumed and produced. These consumed and pro­
duced materials are put in the form of objects called evomats designed to 
follow the evolution of a given material (each one characterized by a 
name, for example “Pu produced in PWR”, an isotopic vector, its type 
of evolution, which can be linear or exponential or entered via a file in 
absolute or relative date of the reactor, and a delay on the availability of 
the material for example due to a cooling or reprocessing time). Examples 
of applications of the ISF code are available in references (Heuer et al., 
2014; Merle-Lucotte et al., 2006).
5.4 Perspectives
Given the interest aroused by MSR in the world, the needs of nuclear 
energy, and the possible collaborations, new studies are underway as men­
tioned above around other applications and versions of the reference 
“MSFR” studied for about 15 years as a high-power reactor and regener­
ator in the Thorium fuel cycle: notably as a low-power Small Modular 
Reactor (SMR), using one of the two fuel cycles 238U/Pu or Th/233U, 
for power generation, or transuranics for nuclear waste incineration. More 
recently, the same type of parametric studies as those done to define the 
“reference MSFR” has thus been extended to other fuel salts such as 

26
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
chlorides and other fissile elements (U235, Pu, and Minor Actinides or 
their mix), fertile ones (U238), and core size as well. Dedicated studies led 
at CNRS showed that the Thorium fuel cycle is more compatible with a 
fluoride salt, while using plutonium and minor actinides as fuel leads to a 
chloride salt mainly due to solubility issues. This explains why the main 
studies performed at CNRS/IN2P3 and focused on the Thorium fuel 
cycle were on fluoride reactors (as the “reference MSFR”), and the new 
developments to design reactors able to burn nuclear wastes are now 
more oriented on chloride reactors. Optimization studies are currently led 
in the frame of the SAMOSAFER project on a new MSFR concept 
equivalent to the “reference MSFR” in terms of power (3 GWth), neu­
tron spectrum (fast), and objective (breeder reactor producing electricity), 
but studied in the U/Pu fuel cycle and so with a chloride NaCl salt.
New studies are currently being conducted at CNRS on other kinds 
of molten salt reactors, for example, as an SMR or even as a micro­
reactor (see the XSMR concept of the NAAREA start-up) of reduced 
power, or operated in the U/Pu fuel cycle, or as an actinide burner, or a 
combination of these characteristics. These research activities are done in 
collaboration with an increasing number of French partners (Orano, 
CEA, Framatome, IRSN, EDF), which reflects a growing national interest 
for MSR technology during recent years in France and also in the world. 
This is combined with the present possibility of moving toward concrete 
realization of such reactors up to a demonstrator in the coming years 
through new collaborations with the NAAREA start-up, and with Orano 
and the Thorizon Dutch start-up in the frame of the new European 
MIMOSA (MultI-recycling with MOlten SAlt technology) project led by 
Orano and selected in 2022 in the Horizon Europe program.
Since 2019, CEA joined the game and developed a more technology- 
oriented 4-year national program that became effective in January 2022 
with the ISAC (Innovative System for Actinides Conversion) project aim­
ing at studying the burning of Pu and Minor Actinides in a chloride 
MSFR called ARAMIS (Advanced Reactor for Actinide Management In 
Salt). The ISAC project led by CEA is funded in the frame to the French 
post-Covid recovery plan. Apart from public laboratories (CEA and 
CNRS), three industrial partners are active in this program: EDF, 
Framatome, and Orano, that is, all the usual French actors of the nuclear 
energy domain.

Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were studied during early phases of reactor 
development in Germany. A fast neutron spectrum reactor concept with­
out graphite in the core, MOSEL, was proposed in Germany at Julich 
and studied in cooperation with US partners (Kasten et al., 1965; Uri Gat, 
1967). The MOSEL reactor with fast neutron spectrum was developed 
primarily for the Th-U fuel cycle, with a fissile liquid fuel for the core 
and a fertile one for the blanket. The core was fueled with uranium fluo­
ride dissolved in a carrier salt. The latter salt was a mixture of beryllium- 
and alkali metal fluorides.
The core contained nickel-alloy structures, such as tubes or plates. 
Within these structures, the fuel was circulated primarily for purposes of 
fuel mixing, addition, and removal. The blanket fluid was thorium fluo­
ride dissolved in the same carrier salt.
In ref (Kasten et al., 1965), the blanket fluid was also used for cooling the 
core. In ref (Uri Gat, 1967), liquid lead was alternatively considered for cool­
ing the MOSEL core; the coolant was allowed to be in direct contact with 
the liquid fuel while passing through the core. This option was proposed to 
enhance heat transfer from the fuel to the lead coolant and under assumption 
that the lead coolant is easily separated from the fuel when it leaves the core.
In the 1970s and 1980s, major nuclear activities in Germany were on 
alternatives to MSR reactor types such as Light-Water Reactors and 
Sodium Fast Reactors. Later, some interest to MSRs reappeared, in partic­
ular, due to proposals to use these reactors for nuclear waste burning. 
These activities were integrated in EURATOM, to which German 
Institutions contributed. Different MSR systems were also studied with 
participation of German institutions within an IAEA project on options 
for nuclear waste incineration (Maschek et al., 2009). In particular, safety- 
related reactor physics parameters, transmutation potential and transient 
behavior in different kinds of MSRs, including those with fertile and

without fertile components in the fuel, were evaluated for the latter IAEA 
project. More recently, MSRs were considered as an option in the 
German study on partitioning and transmutation (Ortwin et al., 2013).
Since early 2000, several EURATOM projects were organized on 
MSR studies, namely the MOST, ALISIA, EVOL, SAMOFAR, 
SAMOSAFER projects. The latter project runs in 2019—23. Major 
nuclear German institutions, in particular the Research Centers of 
Dresden-Rossendorf, Julich, and Karlsruhe, were involved in EU projects 
before 2015. To the current SAMOSAFER project, only the Karlsruhe 
Institute of Technology is now contributing. An Institute of the 
European Joint Research Centre, actively contributing to all EU activities 
on MSRs, is also located at Karlsruhe.
In Julich, the major effort in the past EURATOM projects was done 
on fuel chemistry and reprocessing, while at Karlsruhe and Dresden, the 
activities were mainly on development and application of coupled fluid­
dynamics and neutronics models for simulating core behavior under nom­
inal and transient conditions and for fuel cycle analyses. Initially, both 
fluoride and chloride salts were considered, but soon the efforts were con­
centrated on fluorides in the MOST and following projects. In 
SAMOSAFER, systems with chloride salts are considered again.
The initially studied systems in the MOST project contained graphite 
in the core for neutron moderation, similar to the MSRE reactor. In these 
systems with thermal neutron spectrum, the fuel flows through graphite 
channels in the core.
Information on MSRE experiments was used to validate new compu­
tation models developed for MSRs, including effects of circulation of 
delayed neutron precursors on transient core behavior and neutron bal­
ance. For later EURATOM projects, including SAMOSAFER, mainly 
fast neutron spectrum MSRs were under investigation. The fast systems 
were introduced in order to improve safety-related neutronics parameters, 
in particular reactivity coefficients, while keeping the MSR breeding 
potential. The fast spectrum system systems are also considered preferable 
for nuclear waste burning. The reason is that the probability of fission— 
after a neutron interacts with a nucleus of transuranic fuel—is higher at 
higher energies.
In Dresden, a coupled code developed earlier for LWR reactor transient 
analyses, DYN3D, was extended for MSR applications (Krepel et al., 2007). 
The neutron transport solver in DYN3D is based on the diffusion approxima­
tion, initially developed for HEX-Z geometry and more recently extended to

Germany
33
XYZ in space and to SP3 in angle approximation. The employed cross-section 
library contains cross sections for a reference set of reactor parameters, such as 
fuel temperature. These cross sections are computed in advance by a cell code 
and interpolated during the calculations. The fluid-dynamics part of the code 
for simulating fuel behavior in the core is based on a multichannel approach 
and is well suited for thermal spectrum MSR analyses: the fuel flow is essen­
tially one-dimensional in the graphite channels in the core.
For the fast neutron spectrum cores without graphite, studies in 
Dresden were mainly conducted on irradiation of structure materials sur­
rounding the core (Merk et al., 2014) and on the fast spectrum MSR 
potential for nuclear waste management.
For fast spectrum MSRs, studied in EVOL, SAMOFAR, and 
SAMOSAFER, the fluid pattern in the reactor core can be rather com­
plex because the core is essentially a large tank, in which regions with 
stagnant flow may appear. Special design efforts were made to exclude the 
possibility for formation of stagnant regions, in which the temperature can 
be rather high. At Karlsruhe, this was done by introducing a special flow 
distribution plate below the core for flow profiling. A more recent 
approach proposed by other EU project partners was to modify the shape 
of the core/blanket boundary.
At KIT, a safety code, SIMMER, was extended for MSR simulations 
in order to support the MSR design and safety studies. This code is devel­
oped by JAEA of Japan, in cooperation with CEA of France, KIT of 
Germany, and other partners, initially for analyses of severe accidents in 
sodium fast reactors (Tobita et al., 2002). The code framework is rather 
general, including spatial neutron kinetics and multiphase multicompo­
nent fluid-dynamics models. It was extended in early 2000s for accelerator 
driven systems (ADSs) and other reactor types at KIT. For neutron trans­
port calculations, 2D RZ and 3D XYZ Sn-method-based models are 
used in SIMMER-III, 2D version, and SIMMER-IV, 3D version, respec­
tively. The cross sections used in neutron transport calculations are gener­
ated by SIMMER while using multigroup libraries with f-factors. The 
spatial kinetics model is based on the quasi-static method. The neutronics 
part of the code was extended first (Rineiski et al., 2005) and checked for 
an MSRE experimental model, where the transient flow can be described 
in a rather simple manner. The effect of neutron precursor movement 
was taken into account via an additional source-like term. This integrally 
negative source-like term was introduced in the spatial and point-kinetics 
parts of the code similarly to that was done earlier for simulating the 

34

external neutron source in ADSs. Unlike ADSs, for which the reactivity 
at nominal conditions is negative and the source term is positive, the reac­
tivity at nominal conditions for MSRs in SIMMER is positive, that is 
compensated by a “negative” source-like term appeared due to decay of 
part of delayed neutron precursors outside of the core. The SIMMER 
fluid-dynamics part is based on a multiphase, multiple velocity field 
approach and includes models for phase transfers of reactor materials, such 
as melting/freezing and vaporization/condensation. Flexible equations of 
states (EOSs) are used to describe the reactor material properties. For 
making possible coupled neutronics and fluid-dynamics/thermal-hydrau- 
lics MSR calculations with SIMMER in the general case, the fluid 
dynamics part was extended further; in particular, a new turbulence 
model was introduced, and new EOS for several fluoride salts were 
included in SIMMER at KIT (Wang et al., 2006).
Due to a very general SIMMER code framework, its application takes 
a lot of computer time. For transient MSR analyses, to which simplified 
calculation models are applicable, a faster running coupled code, 
COUPLE, with a two-phase one-velocity-field computational fluid 
dynamics model is also developed at KIT (Guo et al., 2016). Then, a neu- 
tronics code and data system, C4P-TRAIN, applied at KIT in support of 
SIMMER studies, was extended for simulation of fuel cycle and computa­
tion of decay heat in MSR (Rineiski and Sinitsa, 2018).
Recently a new MSR concept, a so-called Dual-Fluid Reactor, was 
proposed by a research group from Berlin, for both energy production 
and waste management. The reactor uses a chloride salt as fuel that flows 
inside metallic structures, which are cooled by liquid lead (Dual-fluid- 
reaktor, 2020: http://dual-fluid-reaktor.de/ See Chapter 22: Generation 
IV International Forum, of this book). This activity is running in parallel 
to the mentioned EU projects.

(ITB);
A group of faculty members at ITB has been interested in MSR 
since 2010, especially the FUJI designs: FUJI-12, miniFUJI, FUJI-U1, 
and FUJI-U3 (Waris et al., 2010a,b, 2012a, 2013, 2015; Aji and 
Waris, 2014; Aji et al., 2015). At first, they were mainly focused on 
high-level nuclear waste (especially plutonium and minor actinides) 
utilization in MSR. However, they are now studying the safety aspects 
of MSRs. The FUJI designs are based on the ORNL MSBR design 
with several improvements. Since 2019, they have considered the 
design of small power of 100 MWe MSR based on FUJI-U3 design 
(Wulandari et al., 2019) and small power of 5—50 MWth Molten Salt 
Fast Reactors (MSFR) based on the European 3000 MWth MSFR 
(Waris et al., 2019; Lestari et al., 2021).

The faculty members at UGM in Yogyakarta, (Andang Widi Harto 
and Team) are mostly concentrated on the design of the fuel cycle and 
safety aspects of the passive, compact molten salt reactors (PCMSRs) 
(Harto, 2015).
PCMSR is designed to utilize thorium. Thorium will be converted to 
fissile 233U. LEU will be used as initial fissile fuel to avoid the use of Pu 
or HEU. The criticality can be maintained by balancing the production 
and consumption of 233U and the depletion of 235U. The composition 
of initial fuel is 6.3% mole of UF4, 23.7% mole of 232ThF4 and 70% 
mole of 7LiF. The initial uranium enrichment is 19% mole of 235U.
7.2 National agencies

In the last decade, R&D activities on circulating fuel Molten Salt 
Reactors (MSRs) have been extensively carried out in Italy and are still in 
progress. In particular, two research groups are active at Politecnico di 
Torino (Polito) and Politecnico di Milano (Polimi), respectively. In this 
chapter, we briefly overview the main R&D activities performed in Italy, 
also in the context of several international collaborations.
8.1 R&D activities at Polito
The research group at Politecnico di Torino has been involved in all the 
EURATOM-supported Projects on MSRs (IABAT, MOST, ALISIA, 
EVOL, SAMOFAR, SAMOSAFER) and in an IAEA Coordinated 
Research Project on transmutation (Maschek et al., 2008), which also consid­
ered such systems. The R&D activities were focused on basic reactor physics 
to handle the molten salt system specificities, with particular regard to the 
moving fuel feature (Lapenta and Ravetto, 2000; Dulla et al., 2017). Delayed 
neutron precursors are also in motion, leading to a reduction of the impor­
tance of emitted neutrons. Moreover, some neutrons are emitted outside the 
core, thus they are unable to take part in the chain reaction. These phenom­
ena lead to a reduction of the effectiveness of the delayed emissions. 
Criticality and time-dependent analyses were carried out by the Polito 
research group over the years (Brovchenko et al., 2019; Delpech et al., 2003),

and the interaction of thermal-hydraulics with neutronics was investigated as 
well (Dulla and Ravetto, 2007; Nicolino et al., 2008; Di Lecce et al., 2018). 
Kinetic methods were extended to the specific circulating fuel configuration 
(e.g., adapting the DYNAMOSS code) (Dulla et al., 2008), and some issues 
related to local perturbations introduced by fuel precipitates and gaseous bubbles 
were investigated (Dulla and Nicolino, 2008) as well, while stochastic effects, 
sensitivity and safety analyses are currently under consideration (Beils et al., 
2019; Dulla et al., 2014; Gerardin et al., 2019; Santanoceto et al., 2021; 
Uggenti et al., 2017).
8.2 R&D activities at Polimi
The research group at Politecnico di Milano has been involved in the 
modeling and analysis of both thermal and fast-neutron-spectrum MSR 
concepts, in the context of several collaborations with other research insti­
tutions (e.g., TU-Delft, PSI, CNRS-Grenoble, KIT, Westinghouse 
Electric Co., VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland). In both ther­
mal and fast liquid-fueled MSRs, the molten salt simultaneously acts as 
fuel and coolant. This leads to a complex environment characterized by 
peculiar features, in comparison with solid-fueled reactors, i.e., the drift of 
delayed neutron precursors and the internal heat generation in a fluid. 
These aspects notably affect the system dynamic behavior and require 
dedicated tools (Luzzi et al., 2012a) to allow for the intrinsic coupling 
between neutronics and thermal fluid dynamics. Hereinafter, the main 
R&D activities carried out by the Polimi group are summarized.
In order to evaluate the effects of the fuel circulation on the system 
kinetics, simplified models (Cammi et al., 2011a) were preliminarily set 
up to allow for the decay of delayed neutron precursors in the out-of­
core part of the primary circuit and assessed against the experimental data 
available for the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment). Afterward, 
analytic, deterministic, and Monte Carlo approaches (Aufiero et al., 
2014a) were developed for calculating the effective delayed neutron frac­
tion in the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), which is the European fast 
reactor concept studied in the frame of the EURATOM EVOL1, 
SAMOFAR1 2 and SAMOSAFER3 Projects. As concerns the analysis of

MSR dynamics, different numerical models were conceived for studying 
the core and system (primary/secondary circuits) behavior of thermal­
neutron-spectrum MSRs, based on lumped and one-dimensional 
approaches. In this framework, the approximations related to the adoption 
of simplified geometries were also investigated (Cammi et al., 2012). 
These models were adopted for stability analyses concerning both thermal 
and fast MSRs (Cammi et al., 2017; Guerrieri et al., 2013) and for a pre­
liminary control-oriented analysis focused on the MSFR (Guerrieri et al., 
2014; Tripodo et al., 2021). As a further development in the direction of 
more accurate dynamic analyses, a Multi-Physics Modeling (MPM) 
approach (Cammi et al., 2011b; Luzzi et al., 2012a; Ramzy et al., 2020) 
was developed to better reproduce the intrinsic coupling between neutro- 
nics and thermal-hydraulics. The adoption of this approach to the study 
of graphite-moderated MSRs allowed a preliminary assessment of the 
developed models on the basis of international benchmarks available for 
both the MSBR (Molten Salt Breeder Reactor) and the MSRE (e.g., in 
the frame MOST Project), pointing out the main advantages offered by 
the multi-physics approach in comparison with the models available in lit­
erature for the MSRs. The MPM approach was also adopted for the 
MSFR transient analysis (Aufiero et al., 2014b; Cervi et al., 2019; Fiorina 
et al., 2014b).
A geometric multiscale modeling strategy (Zanetti et al., 2015) to the 
analysis of MSR “plant dynamics” has been developed at Polimi. It con­
sists of the optimization of the multi-physics modeling through the cou­
pling between a Multi-Physics code (addressing the core modeling with a 
3-D PDE-based approach) and a computational environment that adopts 
simplified 0-D ODE-based models for handling the boundary conditions 
and simulating the remaining part of the system (e.g., the cooling loop) 
with a different level of detail. The aim is to combine the accuracy of the 
MPM approach with acceptable computing power in order to analyze the 
overall plant dynamics.
With reference to the MSFR, the research group at Polimi also devel­
oped an extended version of the SERPENT-2 code to study fuel burn­
up and core material evolution (Aufiero et al., 2013) and carried out an 
investigation on the fuel cycle and the long-term core physics perfor­
mance (in terms of possible initial core loading, actinide burning capabili­
ties, radiotoxicity generation, decay heat, and safety features), which also 
included a systematic comparison with solid-fueled Fast Reactors (Fiorina 
et al., 2013). This R&D activity was also the subject of the IAEA CRP

fuel-cycles-crp-thorium-2011.html.
The thermal-hydraulic behavior of internally heated molten salts flowing 
in straight circular channels was analyzed using both analytic and numerical 
tools (Battistini et al., 2021; Luzzi et al., 2012a,b), with application to 
graphite-moderated MSRs and to the MSFR as well (see also Chapter 6 of 
“Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy,” Elsevier 2017). In this frame­
work, a preliminary heat transfer correlation was proposed (Fiorina et al., 
2014a). In particular, it has been shown that the effect of internal heat gener­
ation can be described by means of a corrective factor to be applied to tradi­
tional correlations (e.g., the Dittus-Boelter or Gnielinski correlations) for the 
Nusselt number. The corrective factor has been demonstrated to be lower 
than one in case of inward wall heat flux, thus implying an overestimation of 
the heat transfer coefficient in case traditional correlations were used. In case 
of outward wall heat flux, the correction factor is instead generally higher 
than 1. Finally, the developed correlation has been used to carry out a 
parametric investigation of the effect of decay heat on the out-of-core com­
ponents of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor. The volumetric power determines 
higher temperatures at the channel wall, but the effect is significant only in 
case of large diameters and/or low velocities. This might be the case of the 
channels of the salt reprocessing system (Fiorina et al., 2014a).
As for the natural circulation dynamics with internal heat generation, 
linear and nonlinear analysis methods were developed to investigate the 
natural circulation features of internally heated fluids for MSR applications 
(Battistini et al., 2021; Cammi et al., 2016b; Pini et al., 2016; Ruiz et al., 
2015; Pini et al., 2014). These methods have constituted the basis for the 
design of a testing facility (DYNASTY), built at the Department of 
Energy - Politecnico di Milano (Cammi et al., 2016a). DYNASTY is 
aimed at: (i) the experimental investigation of the natural circulation 
dynamics in the presence of distributed heat generation, with a specific 
focus on the analysis of thermal-hydraulic instabilities (stability maps); (ii) 
the experimental validation of the theoretical models and simulation tools 
developed to study the natural circulation capability of a loop with a 
homogeneously heated molten salt, useful for the design optimization of 
the MSFR primary circuit. The experimental campaign started in the 
Spring of 2022 and will conclude its first phase in 2023. In Chapter 6

(Section 6.4), the influence of the volumetric heat generation on the sta­
bility features of natural circulation is briefly presented, with reference to 
the stability maps of single-phase rectangular loops.

Ritsuo Yoshioka and Motoyasu Kinoshita
International Thorium Molten-Salt Forum, Yokohama, Japan
Based on the long and wide development at ORNL from the 1950s to 
the 1970s, Kazuo Furukawa and his group in Japan have been investigat­
ing graphite moderated MSR “FUJI” and related accelerator technology 
since the 1980s until the present day (Furukawa et al., 2008; Yoshioka, 
2013). FUJI is mostly based on the MSBR design, with some improve­
ments. His group has provided wide design results, such as detailed design 
results of FUJI-U3 for self-sustaining, FUJI-Pu for Pu start-up, transmuta­
tion capability of minor actinides, super-FUJI of 1000 MWe, and a pilot 
plant mini-FUJI, which are described in Chapter 11 of “Molten Salt 
Reactors and Thorium Energy,” Elsevier 2017, Liquid fuel, thermal neu­
tron spectrum reactors. In order to promote MSR development, 
Furukawa and his group established the International Thorium Molten- 
Salt Forum (ITMSF) (2008) and the Thorium Tech Solution Inc. (TTS) 
(2010).
ITMSF is a nonprofit organization, which is composed of researchers 
and engineers from 14 countries who are involved or interested in MSR 
and related thorium cycles. Until 2021, 27 seminars had been held in 
Japan. The Japan Atomic Energy Committee (JAEC) issued a formal 
opinion paper in 2012, which mentioned candidates for future nuclear 
applications, including thorium usage. ITMSF proposed its MSR to the 
JAEC in 2013 (Yoshioka and Kinoshita, 2013). ITMSF has been an 
observer member of the MSR group of the GIF (the Generation IV 
International Forum) since it started in 2005 and has participated in the 
discussions in recent years (Serp et al., 2014).
Under the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, a special committee was 
started as “Nuclear Application of Molten Salt.” In this committee, experts, 
including several ITMSF members, discuss MSR, dry reprocessing, fusion 
application, and so on. A working group within this committee is participat­
ing in the ANS20.1 committee, where the general design criteria (GDC) for 
the FHR (fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor) are discussed (ANS

200.1 Working Group, 2014). Based on the discussions in the ANS20.1 
committee, the GDC for the MSR is proposed in Chapter 11, Liquid fuel, 
thermal neutron spectrum reactors.
As for TTS, its final target is the commercialization of FUJI, which is 
based on developments including ITMSF. A small thorium MSR inte­
grated with heat exchangers, named UNOMI (Universally Operable 
Molten-salt reactor Integrated) (Kamei, 2013), is proposed by a member 
in ITMSF. TTS is now developing various MSR designs and compo­
nents. In order to expand markets, TTS is now designing a micro-sized 
(25 MWe miniFUJI II), based on helium gas turbine (Aso, 2021). 
Another example is shown in Fig. 9.1, which is a molten salt test loop 
with FLiNaK for circulation technology, working together with 
Sukegawa Electric Co., Ltd.
The following are the basic studies related to MSR at Japanese univer­
sities or research laboratories.
1. Volatile FP release experiment in molten salts, which is related to the MSR 
source term issue, at the University of Fukui (Yamawaki et al., 2015).
2. Corrosion study of Hastelloy N in molten salt, at the University of 
Fukui (Fukumoto et al., 2015).
3. Molten salt chemistry for nuclear systems, at the University of Tokyo 
(Terai et al., 2001).
4. Dry reprocessing using molten salt, at the Central Research Institute 
of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) (Koyama et al., 2012).

5. FLiNaK-loop experiment for fusion technology, at the National 
Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS) (Sagara et al., 2015).
The Japanese government started to support the development of MSR 
technology from 2019. Three MSR companies are selected. Two (TTS 
and MOSTECH) are promoting an MSR with fluoride salt that is moder­
ated by graphite. And another is BERD, promoting Integral Molten Salt 
Fast Reactor System (IMSFR) with TRU (Pu, MA) in chloride salt, 
where universities (TIT, Fukui, Doshisha) and CRIEPI are working 
together (Yamawaki, 2021).
MOSTECH is performing molten salt loop experiments, one is freeze 
valve experiments, which is installed at a FLiNaK loop in NIFS (Fig. 9.2) 
(Aji et al., 2019). Another loop is tested at the University of Kyushu.

Deokjung Lee and Yongjin Jeong
Department of Nuclear Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, 
Republic of Korea
In Korea, Se Kee Oh and his group at Ajou University performed MSR 
research actively from 1998 to 2008, and UNIST (Ulsan National 
Institute of Science and Technology) started MSR research in 2002. 
Work on basic research has continued up to the present day.
Ajou University first set up a computer code system for MSR analysis, 
which consists of HELIOS (HELIOS methods, 1998), AMDEC, and 
AMBIKIN2D (Lee and Oh, 2008; Young Joon, 2008). HELIOS is a 
commercially available code from Studsvik Scandpower Inc., and 
AMDEC and AMBIKIN2D are inhouse codes developed at Ajou 
University specifically for MSR analyses. HELIOS solves two-dimensional 
neutron/gamma transport problems and generates lattice parameters for 
the downstream diffusion calculations by AMBIKIN2D. AMBIKIN2D is 
a two-group, two-dimensional neutron kinetics code for MSR transient 
analysis, taking into account the flowing fuel-induced neutronics effects 
such as the reduction of effective delayed neutron fractions caused by the 
liquid fuel loop circulating through the outside loop of the core. It solves 
the R-Z time dependent diffusion problems and calculates eigenvalues, 
fluxes, power shapes, and reaction rates of the core. AMDEC performs 
the fuel depletion calculations in multiregion fluid-fuel loop systems with 
continuous feeding and reconditioning processes. HELIOS provides 
AMDEC with spectrum weighted 1-group cross section sets, and 
AMDEC provides HELIOS with updated nuclide number densities. 
HELIOS also provides the AMBIKIN2D code with two-group macro­
scopic cross-section data. The code system was used for the design and 
analysis of Ajou University’s unique MSR design, AMBIDEXTER.
Ajou University designed AMBIDEXTER-NEC (Advanced Molten- 
salt Break-even Inherently-safe Dual-function EXcellenTly-Ecological 
Reactor Nuclear Energy Complex), which encompasses a reactor core, 
primary pump, heat exchanger, power generator, chemical processing

units, etc. (Oh et al., 1998, 2000a,b, 2001, 2002). The design objective of 
the reactor is to burn DUPIC fuel (Ham et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2007) 
and to minimize minor actinides production while generating electric 
power. To achieve the objectives, the AMBIDEXTER reactor core con­
sists of two parts: a blanket region and a seed region. The blanket region 
consists of only molten salt fuel (LiF-BeF2-(Th,U,Pu)F4), and the seed 
region consists of the molten salt fuel and graphite moderator channel. 
The blanket region has a very hard neutron spectrum like a fast reactor, 
and the seed region has a soft neutron spectrum like a pressurized water 
reactor (PWR). The seed region mainly burns molten-salt fuel, and the 
blanket region mainly burns minor actinides because of the neutron spec­
trum characteristics of each region. AMBIDEXTER was designed as a 
burner reactor, which has a low conversion ratio, 0.298. Unfortunately, 
when Prof. Oh retired from Ajou University, the MSR research in Korea 
stopped until 2012, when UNIST started MSR research.
Deokjung Lee and his group at UNIST have been developing a code 
system for the simulation of online reprocessing and refueling and deple­
tion of a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) (Robertson, 1971). The 
MSBR was designed by ORNL (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in the 
1970s. The MSBR adopts molten salt as a liquid fuel as well as coolant, 
and graphite material as a neutron moderator and reflector. The reactor 
core of the MSBR is divided into two zones with different fuel-to- 
graphite ratios. Zone-1 has a low fuel-to-graphite ratio and most fission 
reactions occur here, and while zone-2 has a high fuel-to-graphite ratio 
and most breeding occurs here. UNIST investigated three different equi­
librium composition search approaches for the MSBR using the nuclear 
reactor core analysis computer code system based on the MCNP6 
Monte-Carlo code. (1) The first search method uses a representative 
average single unit cell for both zones. The single unit cell model uses 
volume-weighted average fuel and moderator compositions and sizes 
(Jeong et al., 2014a,b; Jeong et al., 2015a). (2) The second method uses 
two representative unit cells, one for each zone, which preserves the fuel- 
to-moderator ratio of each zone (Jeong et al., 2015a,b). (3) The third 
method directly models the whole MSBR core. The code system was 
set up with the MCNP6 Monte-Carlo code, its depletion module 
CINDER90, and the Python scripting language (Park et al., 2015a,b,c). 
Python is used for implementing the batch-wise reprocessing and refuel­
ing. In the process of calculating the equilibrium fuel compositions, vari­
ous parameters such as the multiplication factor, breeding ratio, and 

Korea
55
number density can be obtained to analyze the MSBR. The MSBR 
whole core analysis is performed at the initial and equilibrium core condi­
tions, for various reactor design parameters such as normalized neutron 
flux distribution, temperature coefficients, rod worth, and power distribu­
tions. The neutronics core characteristics were analyzed using the four- 
factor formula applied to the single-cell model, two-cell model, and the 
two zones of the whole core, separately.
UNIST plans to develop a new high fidelity code system for MSR 
analysis including the online reprocessing and refueling, and the modeling 
capability of the movement of liquid fuel and the delayed neutron precur­
sors. Furthermore, it is planning to develop a new MSR core concept 
using the developed code system.

11.1 NRG activities
NRG operates the 45 MW High Flux Reactor in Petten with two main 
goals: to produce medical isotopes and to investigate effects of neutron 
irradiation in nuclear fuels and materials. Past irradiation campaigns con­

et al., 2008) have contributed to developments in the field, culminating in 
qualification efforts for power reactors (Knol et al., 2018).
An R&D campaign was started in 2014 to expand general competence 
in material and fuel irradiations to include the field of molten salt reactors. 
The core of NRG’s multi-year MSR technology program is formed by a 
series of molten fuel salt capsule irradiations focused on fission product 
migration and material compatibility issues, plus a series of high- 
temperature alloy irradiations to address mechanical degradation of vessel 
and internals. These efforts should form a basis for future material and fuel 
qualification efforts. Associated work is also being performed on radiolytic 
gas production in salts at near room temperature, penetration of salt into 
(irradiated) moderator graphite, MSR-related modeling efforts including 
an extension of a system thermal hydraulics code for MSRs and develop­
ment of a multi-physics three-dimensional computational platform, and 
conversion of molten fuel salt waste to an acceptable waste form.
11.2 MSR fuel irradiations
As of early 2022, a fuel salt irradiation capsule is being fabricated and assem­
bled with the central goal of obtaining long-term in-pile corrosion rates for 
Hastelloy N at MSR-relevant temperatures. The SALIENT-03 sample 
holder designed by NRG and JRC Petten contains five welded, salt-filled 
capsules (Fig. 11.1). Salt samples were fabricated and purified by R&D part­
ner JRC Karlsruhe. The basic composition in line with the European MSFR

efforts (Fiorina et al., 2013) is 75LiF-18.7ThF4—6UF4—0.3PuF3, but UF3 
and CrFx were added to individual capsules to screen for beneficial effects of 
limiting redox potential and shifting the chemical equilibrium of the corro­
sion reaction.
The fission power generated in the liquid salt produces a convective 
flow pattern with flow velocities up to 2 cm/s and temperature gradients 
up to 200°C (Fig. 11.2). To improve information on the in-core temper­
ature gradients in the flowing salt, the bottom capsule has been given an 
annular geometry, which enables insertion of three central thermocouples 
at different axial positions. This configuration should allow reconstructing 
the axial temperature gradient (600°C—800°C) and collecting information 
on temperature-dependent corrosion in that gradient, comparable to the 
information obtained from loop operation. The other four capsules are 
designed to operate at a more or less constant salt-capsule interface tem­
perature of around 700°C.
The top capsule in SALIENT-03 is connected to a pressure sensor, 
which during irradiation will follow fission gas release from the salt. This 
capsule also contains three nickel electrodes with the aim to collect basic 
I-V curves during irradiation. Reference curves for non-irradiated salt 
were obtained previously in a glovebox oven setup.
Figure 11.2 Relative temperature and velocity profiles for the top capsule. The abso­
lute in-core temperatures are controlled during irradiation by changing gas gap con­
ductivity around the sample holder.

60
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Post-irradiation examinations following an irradiation period of 
420—550 full power days should include gamma scans (to obtain the dis­
tribution of fission products over the capsule volume), ICP-OES and 
ICP-Ms measurement to collect information on salt burn-up and on 
chromium accumulated through the corrosion process, plenum gas analy­
sis to establish fission gas release, and SEM/WDS measurements to obtain 
corrosion depths and fission product deposition profiles. Small salt samples 
will finally be transported to JRC Karlsruhe for additional electron 
microscopy and Knudsen Cell Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS). The 
latter produces information on vaporization behavior of the salt and 
the contained fission and corrosion products up to temperatures at which 
the salt completely evaporates.
SALIENT-03 builds on previous experience from the SALIENT-01 
project (Hania et al., 2021). In SALIENT-01, four open graphite capsules 
containing 78LiF-22ThF4 salt were (2017 — 19) inside a welded steel sam­
ple holder; a sister irradiation (SALIENT-02) containing UF4-LiF-BeF2 
was designed and partially built, but ultimately abandoned because of 
uncertainties around the radiolytic production of fluorine gas (F2) at low 
salt temperatures and related safety issues such as corrosion of the graphite 
capsules and steel containment, subsequent exothermic release of CF4(g) 
and similar gases from graphite at high temperature, and chemical reactiv­
ity of the reduced salt Hania et al. (2021). Measurements performed at 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory Haubenreich (1970), Toth and Felker 
(1990), and Trowbridge et al. (2002) have previously shown that the phe­
nomenon of radiolytic gas production does not occur at temperatures 
above around 150°C and is most significant at temperatures below 70°C. 
Using this information, SALIENT-03 has been equipped with electric 
heaters that are engaged when sample temperatures drop to below 150°C, 
which occurs during reactor downtime or SCRAM events.
An additional issue of SALIENT-01 was the rather large change in fis­
sion power density over the course of the irradiation. By breeding of 
233U from the 232Th in the salt, power density would increase over the 
course of months. While the average temperature of the capsules can be 
controlled by changing gas gap composition around the sample holder, 
the temperature gradient in the salt is largely determined by the generated 
fission power. For SALIENT-03, in order to maintain a constant tempera­
ture gradient in the salt column, a composition was chosen for which 
breeding and burning are nearly in equilibrium, ensuring a nearly constant 
power density in the salt.

11.3 Radiolysis at low temperatures
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, a decrease of the salt temperature 
to below 70°C—150°C poses the risk of radiolytic production of fluorine 
gas and an accompanying reduction of the fuel salt. This issue does not 
occur during normal operation, when temperatures should stay above the 
melting point of the salt (generally in the range of 400°C—600°C), but 
may become relevant in case of salt spills from the primary containment 
or in the context of waste storage (Blankenship, 1964).
In an attempt to quantify and model radiolysis in salt at near room 
temperature as well as temperature-assisted recombination of the liberated 
gas and the reduced salt at elevated temperature, a test facility with the 
name SAGA (SAlt GAmma) was designed and built at NRG. The facility 
contains six sealed Monel-400 capsules of which the inside walls are satu­
rated with fluorine gas at 200°C. Each capsule contains a salt powder sam­
ple with helium cover gas at 1 bar (room temperature) and is connected 
to a pressure sensor. After placing the SAGA facility in the strong gamma 
field of an arrangement of HFR spent fuel elements, pressure rise is moni­
tored to follow radiolytic gas production. The facility itself lacks the hea­
ters required to induce recombination, but individual salt capsules can be 
taken out of the facility following irradiation and put in a tube oven for a 
post-irradiation recombination test. The experiments using the SAGA 
facility are ongoing, and results will be combined to conclude on the 
influence of salt chemistry and grain size on radiolysis.
11.4 Qualification of MSR construction materials
In 2021, NRG has also started the first of a series of high-temperature 
irradiations of MSR construction materials with the aim to assess degrada­
tion of mechanical performance in a strong neutron field. The 
ENICKMA facility contains a set of tensile/low cycle fatigue and stress 
relaxation samples irradiated in inert atmosphere at 650°C, as well as a 
smaller set at 700°C—730°C. The sample matrix comprises nickel- 
molybdenum-chromium alloys including Hastelloy N, Hastelloy 242, 
MONICR and GH3535, and the 316 L(N) steel developed within the 
French ASTRID SFR program. Target duration for the experiment is 
275 full power days, equivalent to 0.8—1.5dpa (depending on sample 
location) and 4—30- appm He (depending mostly on boron content in 
the heats). A parallel oven test is conducted at the same temperatures and 

62
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
duration, and mechanical test results for the oven samples and irradiated 
samples are compared with the as-fabricated specimens. This is done to 
separate the irradiation effects, of which helium embrittlement is perhaps 
the most significant in a thermal spectrum and at the relatively high tem­
peratures of interest, from the pure temperature effects. A follow-up 
experiment will be carried out to evaluate to what extent creep is 
enhanced by irradiation at MSR temperatures.
11.5 MSR simulation efforts
For the design and safety analysis of a nuclear reactor, mostly fast-running 
lumped parameter, so-called system thermal hydraulic codes are being 
used. At NRG, the SPECTRA system thermal hydraulics code has been 
extended to allow simulation of molten salt-cooled and -fueled reactors 
(Stempniewicz, 2020a,b,c). These developments have been applied to and 
verified with results from MSRE, other experiments, and code-to-code 
comparisons as reported in Stempniewicz and Roelofs (2021), Roelofs 
and Stempniewicz (2021), and Hua et al. (2022). For molten salt reactor 
applications, the fluid properties and heat transfer correlations can flexibly 
be defined by the user. A point reactor kinetics model as well as a nodal 
point kinetics model is available, with an isotope transformation model to 
compute concentrations of important isotopes (for example, 135Xe). The 
package for radioactive particle transport in the code deals with radioac­
tive fission product chains, release of fission products, aerosol transport, 
deposition, and resuspension. With all extensions made to the SPECTRA 
code, the code can model the following relevant phenomena for a system 
fueled with molten salt:
• 
delayed neutron precursor drift;
• 
fission product transport in molten salt reactors, for example, 135Xe 
(see Fig. 11.3);
• 
noble gas and noble metal behavior;
• 
noble metal extraction;
• 
chromium leaching and deposition.
For some analyses, a system thermal hydraulic code will not provide the 
required level of detail, especially with respect to three-dimensional flow and 
heat transport features. Therefore, in 2021, NRG started to develop a 
medium resolution simulation platform based on Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD) coupled with neutron transport codes similar to the plat­
form published by Cervi et al. (2019). The CFD models developed to

simulate noble metal extraction via flotation (Capelli et al., 2018) will be 
included in that platform in a later stage.
11.6 Research at TU Delft
Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has a long tradition with homo­
geneous nuclear reactors, starting in the 1950s with the research of Prof. J.J. 
Went on a homogeneous reactor at the KEMA site and Prof. D.G.H. 
Latzko on the use of molten salts as heat transfer fluids for power generation.
The interest in homogeneous reactors revived at TU Delft at the 
beginning of this century as part of a research program on Generation-IV 
reactors. It was realized that breeding of new fuel and complete destruc­
tion of long-lived actinides could best be realized in a homogeneous reac­
tor. Research on the thermal Molten Salt Reactor started in 2005 and 
focused on the thorough understanding of the Molten Salt Reactor 
Experiment (MSRE) and on improving the US Molten Salt Breeder 
Reactor (MSBR) design. Various alternatives were investigated among 
one-fluid, one-and-a-half fluid, and two-fluid designs. In addition, the 
chemical and physical properties of various fuel salt were studied, in close 
collaboration with the JRC-Karlsruhe. Although the thermal MSR design 
clearly has a lot of potential, research at TU Delft now focuses on the

64
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) originally proposed by CNRS and 
adopted as the reference design for Generation-IV in Europe. This 
resulted in two EC-funded projects coordinated by TU Delft: 
SAMOFAR running from 2015 till 2019, and SAMOSAFER running 
from 2019 till 2023.
TU Delft focuses on fundamental research regarding the computation 
challenges in MSR, numerical and experimental work to study freezing/ 
melting and heat transfer phenomena, to derive thermophysical properties 
of the (fuel) salt, as well as various applications such as safety assessment 
and the design of freeze plugs and passive decay heat removal mechan­
isms. Furthermore, TU Delft investigates the phase equilibria and thermo­
dynamic properties of both fluoride and chloride salts, their chemical 
interaction with structural materials, and the chemical speciation of fission 
and corrosion products generated during irradiation using a combination 
of experimental studies and thermodynamic modeling assessments using 
the CALPHAD method.
11.7 Numerical code development and transient analysis
The TU Delft simulation package combines a state-of-the-art discrete ordi­
nates neutron tool with a newly developed fluid dynamics simulation code. 
The package was verified with code to code comparisons with other partners 
and with benchmarks from literature. The code system has been used to 
investigate the behavior of the MSFR under both steady-state and transient 
conditions. The transients studied were Unprotected Loss Of Heat Sink 
(ULOHS), Unprotected Loss Of Fuel Flow (ULOFF), Total Loss Of Power 
(TLOP), Unprotected Pump Over-Speed (UPOS), and salt Over-Cooling 
(OVC). The main conclusion from these simulations is that the reactor 
response to these scenarios is excellent. No major weak points have been 
identified regarding the safety of the MSFR design: modest temperature var­
iations are found, and power variations are strongly damped by reactor feed­
back. An example of the salt temperature distribution obtained from our 
multi-physics analysis is shown in Fig. 11.4.
11.8 Reduced order model development
Multi-physics analyses of the three-dimensional MSFR are computation­
ally inherently expensive. To partially counteract this, a strong effort has 
been made in the development of Reduced order modeling (ROM) at

Netherlands
65

part with height and diameter of 226 cm) and heat exchanger with a pump during a 
TLOP transient.
TU Delft. The focus has been on methods that are non-intrusive to be 
able to work with complex models without requiring access to the under­
lying model equation, i.e., a black box approach. The newly developed 
methods are based on adaptive sampling of the parameter space combined 
with interpolation for the amplitudes of a set of modes that adequately 
describe the system, the latter determined by proper orthogonal decom­
position (POD). The set of modes and their amplitudes are adaptively 
enriched by sampling the parameter space where the errors are largest 
until specified error criteria are met. The methodology has also been 
extended to transient scenarios where time is treated as any other input 
parameter, which enables efficient handling of parametric dynamic mod­
els. The ROM method has subsequently been used for uncertainty quan­
tification. Steady-state analysis has been performed for 30 independent 
input parameters originating from cross sections, neutron precursors, and 
thermodynamics parameters. The various parameters’ influence has been 
ranked, and probability distributions of various key parameters such as k- 
eff and the maximum temperature have been made. An example of such 
distributions is shown in Fig. 11.5.

66

and of the multiplication factor, k-eff under influence of input parameter variation.
11.9 Polynomial Chaos expansion development and 
application
TU Delft has also made significant progress in developing and applying 
Generalized Polynomial Chaos expansion (GPC) methods to perform fast 
and accurate uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the 
MSFR despite the computationally expensive multi-physics modeling 
required. Just like ROM, GPC represents a black box approach that 
builds efficient meta-models of selected important system responses as a 
function of uncertain physical/chemical properties and undefined design 
parameters. Because multi-dimensional polynomial approximations 
(instead of hierarchical linear interpolation as in the ROM approach) are 
being used, it is more applicable in cases of strong nonlinearity. 
Moreover, it provides a straightforward approach to derive local sensitivi­
ties as well as global variance-based sensitivity metrics (Sobol indices). We 
have used GPC to identify parameters with significant effect on the per­
formance metrics of the MSFR.
GPC has also been used to quantify the uncertainty regarding the salt 
composition. As the MSFR will use molten salt as fuel, knowing the 
physicochemical properties of the salt is paramount under all conditions. 
This is heavily hindered by both the lack of available data and the inher­
ent difficulty of predicting properties for such multicomponent systems, 
containing many different elements due to the emergence of fission pro­
ducts. TU Delft has addressed this issue by combining our GPC tools 
with the CALPHAD method (CALculation of Phase Diagrams), allowing 
quantifying the uncertainties in predicted phase diagrams. By analyzing 
the relation between the uncertain input parameters and experimental 

Netherlands
67
uncertainties, the input parameters can be tuned and give statistical infor­
mation about parameters that can be calculated, but not measured.
11.10 Ultrasonic technique for measuring viscosity of fluids
An innovative method based on ultrasonic waves propagation is being 
developed for the simultaneous determination of the viscosity and den­
sity of the molten salt fuel at elevated temperatures. A thin plate is 
used as a waveguide to transmit shear waves separating the transducer 
from harsh environments such as elevated temperatures, highly corro­
sive fluids, and/or radioactive fluids. At the solid—fluid interface, the 
echo signal of the ultrasonic wave depends on the operating frequency, 
the physical properties of the fluid (viscosity and density), and the 
properties of the waveguide (density and shear modulus). The research 
at TU Delft dealt with the study of the factors for determining the 
physical properties and the solutions required to maximize the accuracy 
of the proposed technique, especially at very low viscosities. Rheology 
beyond Newtonian fluids is under investigation as well.
11.11 Development of a passive freeze plug
In the MSR, passive protection is provided by a so-called freeze plug. 
The freeze plug is an actively cooled blockage consisting of solidified salt. 
In the case of, e.g., a station blackout, the plug will melt, enabling the 
reactor vessel contents to flow into underground tanks. In the MSFR, this 
process must be completed within 8 minutes at most to prevent damage 
to the reactor vessel and components. One of the promising designs con­
sists of a thick distribution plate that contains holes of a certain diameter, 
see Fig. 11.6. This design increases the melting surface and diminishes the 
drainage time of the reactor vessel. Plate material and geometry were var­
ied. Based on preliminary calculations, the drainage time can be reduced 
to 6 minutes, which is below the prescribed 8 minutes.
11.12 Molten salt-structural materials interaction
The suitability of the structural material is defined to a large extent 
by its resistance against corrosion by the fluoride/chloride salt. The 
MSRE experience showed that Hastelloy-N, a Ni-Cr-Mo alloy, 
could withstand the harsh operational conditions in the reactor (high

temperatures, contact with the corrosive fluoride salt, high radiation 
dose), and prospective alloys in current MSR designs includes the 
above chemical elements. The rate of corrosion is primarily deter­
mined by the redox potential of the salt, which is controlled by the 
UF4/UF3 ratio for a fluoride mixture. During irradiation, free fluo­
rine is formed, which reacts with UF3, hence increasing the UF4/UF3 
ratio and leading to oxidation reactions such as Cr(alloy) 1 
2UF4(salt) 5 CrF2 (salt) 1 2UF3(salt), and subsequent formation of 
voids in the Ni-based structural alloy. Among the large panel of 
MSR designs under investigation, reactors with and without redox 
control or salt cleanup are under consideration. Because Ni is the 
main element of the structural alloy, and Cr is the most likely to be 
dissolved, we have been recently studying the phase equilibria of the 
fuel salt with potential Ni and Cr corrosion products. We have devel­
oped for the first time a thermodynamic model for the AF-NiF2, AF- 
CrF3 (A 5 Li, Na, K), LiF-CrF2, and CrF2-CrF3 systems, which can 
feed computer simulations codes that model the behavior of the liq­
uid fuel during operation and under accidental conditions.
Besides the effects of corrosion on the salt, the effects of corrosion on 
the structural materials should also be studied. In addition, the microscopic 
processes in materials under radiation at elevated temperatures are gov­
erned by radiation damage and microstructure instability, which should be 
understood in detail in order to predict long-term behavior.

11.13 Chemical speciation of fission products
The importance of chemical speciation of fission products in nuclear fuels is 
beyond doubt. The fate of these elements and their influence on the fuel 
properties strongly depend on their chemical state, which in turn depends on 
the reactor parameters, such as temperature and redox potential. For reactors 
that use molten fluoride salt mixtures as nuclear fuel, a thorough thermo­
chemical analysis of the most important fission products is not yet complete. 
In order to predict the stable phases and the physicochemical properties of 
the mixtures, thermochemical analysis and phase diagram studies are 
employed. Two thermodynamic databases are under development at TU 
Delft, one including the main salt-soluble fission products (e.g., caesium and 
iodine) and one including the noble metals and their fluoride phases.
The chemistry of caesium and iodine is particularly relevant as their 
potential release into the environment is a subject of primary concern for 
the safety of the general public. The isotopes 135Cs, 137Cs, 131I are indeed 
the main cause for the radiological consequences of an accident, and their 
behavior in nuclear fuels must be carefully evaluated. A comprehensive 
thermodynamic assessment of the Li,Cs,Th//F,I system was therefore per­
formed at TU Delft in collaboration with JRC-Karlsruhe and NRG and 
combines experimental phase diagram investigations, vapor pressure mea­
surements, and thermodynamic modeling.
A quite different behavior is expected for the noble metal class of fis­
sion products of which Mo, Nb, and Ru are the most important contri­
butors. They are expected to be in the metallic state under the reducing 
conditions, which would normally be maintained in the reactor as a result 
of the redox control of the salt during operation. Nevertheless, knowl­
edge of their thermochemistry and in particular of the formation of noble 
metal fluoride phases is essential to understand their fluorination behavior 
and establish a proper fission product management strategy. A thermody­
namic model of the noble metal elements Mo-Nb-Ru-F has been devel­
oped for this purpose, by combining first-principles calculations and 
CALPHAD-type modeling assessment.
11.14 The influence of melting and solidification on heat 
transfer
A good understanding of the melting and solidification phenomena of the 
LiF-ThF4-UF4 fuel in the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is required 

70
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
for the design of the freeze plug, a key safety component, for an accurate 
prediction of the possible formation and growth of a solid layer of salt on 
the reactor walls during normal operation and for the analysis of accident 
scenarios where solidification of the fuel salt might pose a risk. As such, 
the goal of this research is to improve our knowledge and understanding 
of the physics underlying the phase-change process. To this end, the 
effects of phase change will be included in a CFD model based on techni­
ques such as the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach through the so- 
called enthalpy method, where the melting/solidification front is tracked 
implicitly, and models based on the lattice-Boltzmann method. Validation 
of the applied numerical models is being performed through a set of 
phase-change experiments for both laminar and turbulent flow regimes.
11.15 Noble particles extraction
One of the advantages of having a liquid fuel is the possibility of control­
ling and extracting fission products while operating the reactor. At pres­
ent, helium bubbling is seen as the most mature technique for in-core 
removal of fission products, and it is employed to extract the gaseous fis­
sion products. Moreover, this process has also the potential to remove via 
flotation the insoluble particles, such as noble metals, which might other­
wise deposit on colder metallic surfaces. A feasibility and performance 
study for the removal of particles via flotation is ongoing at TU Delft in 
collaboration with NRG. It aims to gain a better understanding of the 
underlying mechanisms involved in the process and evaluate the depen­
dence of the extraction efficiency with the process parameters. An experi­
mental setup using simulant fluids is developed for this purpose and 
provides the required data (local, instantaneous particle concentrations) for 
process optimization and scale-up in molten salt systems. The particle 
concentrations are measured with the help of Laser-Induced Fluorescence 
and particles with sizes varying from B100 nm to micrometers.
11.16 Development of a thermodynamic database
A large thermodynamic database has been developed over the years by 
the JRC-Karlsruhe for fluoride and chloride salts, based on the 
CALPHAD methodology and quasi-chemical formalism in the quadruplet 
approximation, which allows the computation of thermodynamic equilib­
rium properties of multicomponent systems. The models in this database

rely on the great wealth of phase diagram and crystallographic studies pro­
duced by the original MSRE program at ORNL, as well as other miscel­
laneous sources, and more recent measurements performed at the JRC. 
For a long time, TU Delft has been contributing to the development of 
this database in a joint effort with JRC-Karlsruhe, with experimental 
structural and thermodynamic studies, and modeling activities. Fission 
product (Cs, I, Nb, Mo, Ru) systems, and corrosion product (Ni, Cr) sys­
tems, as mentioned previously, have been investigated. Moreover, we 
have recently reexamined, among others, the LiF-UF4, NaF-ThF4, KF- 
ThF4, AF-ZrF4 (A 5 Li,Na,K), NaCl-UCl3, ACl-ThCl4 (A 5 Li,Na,K), 
and NaCl-ThCl4-PuCl3 systems, as part of an effort to systematically 
review and model the actinide containing fuel systems including fission 
and corrosion products.
11.17 Structural studies and structural-thermodynamic 
modeling
It is known that depending on conditions of composition, temperature, and 
redox potential, the local structure of the molten salt (an ionic liquid) can 
vary widely with cases where the ions in the melt are completely dissoci­
ated, form molecular species, or even exhibit some degree of network for­
mation (polymerization). The local structure of the melt can be directly 
related to the thermodynamic and transport (viscosity, thermal conductivity) 
properties. A fundamental understanding of the relationship between the 
local structure of the molten salt and its physicochemical and thermody­
namic properties is needed to gain greater predictive capability over the 
dynamic (far from ideal) behavior of the fuel salt. Through in situ high 
temperature Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectros­
copy studies in the molten states, interpreted with the aid of Molecular 
Dynamics, we have explored the structural characteristics of the AF-AnF4 
melts (A 5 Li, Na, K, Cs; An 5 Th, U). A dedicated molten salt furnace 
setup was developed at the TU Delft for the EXAFS measurements of 
hygroscopic, corrosive, and radioactive salts. Moreover, in combination 
with the quasi-chemical formalism, we have developed and optimized 
CALPHAD models, which reproduce the structure of the melt simulta­
neously with the phase diagram and key thermodynamic properties (mixing 
enthalpies, heat capacities, activity coefficients, etc.). This is ongoing work, 
but to date, the advanced models have been successfully applied to LiF- 
BeF2, LiF-UF4, NaF-ThF4, NaCl-UCL3, and AF-ZrF4 (A 5 Li, Na, K).

12.1 Thorium discovery in Norway
The element Thorium was actually discovered in Norway in 1828. At 
that time, Norway was in a union with Sweden after having been part of 
Denmark for some 400 years. Norway experienced in the 19th century a 
blossoming of science, literature, and arctic discoveries that paved the way 
for full independence in 1905.
The mineral named “thoritt” was found by Hans Morten Thrane 
Esmark at the tiny island of L0v0y in Telemark. He was the son of the 
geology assessor Jens Esmark at Kongsberg where silver had been mined 
for centuries. Even if Hans had a passion for minerals, he chose to become 
a priest and was sent to Brevik in Telemark. His duties in the parish 
allowed for crisscrossing circuits in the fjord archipelagos. The brown 
mineral “thoritt” was sent to his chemist friend Jons Jakob Berzelius in 
Stockholm that was the intellectual capital of the union kingdoms.
Berzelius undertook the then state-of-the-art examinations and con­
cluded that “thoritt” had to be newly discovered mineral that also con­
tained a new element. Berzelius has long been dreaming of a calling a 
new element after the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. Apparently, the 
priest did not protest to the naming after a pagan god.
12.2 Thorium fever
Th has special geochemical properties, and as a result, Th-minerals have 
ended up in pegmatites, a kind of geological dustbins from melting

processes in inner Earth. “Thoritt” nuggets the size of walnuts can be 
found along the fjordline of Telemark. From the 1880s, a klondyke set in 
and the world production came from only this area. Th was paid several 
hundreds crowns a kilo, a fortune at the time, for use as glowing mantles 
in Auer lamps. People fought over claims, but the bonanza came to a stop 
when Th could be extracted by simple using spades and picks in the 
United States, Brazil, and India before the turn of the century. Electric 
light outcompeted the lamps. “Thoritt” chunks probably never will be of 
commercial interest again.
12.3 Telemark geology
Th has been identified at several locations in Telemark, but Fen is the 
main spot. Fen is a very unique formation. Six-hundred million years old, 
it seems to have been a plug sprung open during the creation of the 
Oslofjord spewing up exotic minerals from deep down. Its twin is the 
Tanzanian volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai. “Thoritt” ThSO4 is not the main 
mineral. “Rauhaugkitt” and “Ankeritt” contain iron and carbonates. 
ThO2 crystals are finely dissolved in the hard rock at concentrations of 
0.2%—0.4%. Mining and refining are deemed to turn out costly compared 
with monazite. However, Europium, Cerium, Neodymium, Lanthanum, 
and other Rare Earth Elements at around 1% could make profitable value 
chains in the current marketplace.
12.4 Commercial interest
The Germans initiated mining for Niobium during WWII. The operation 
was closed down in 1965.
Helicopter gamma surveys were carried out in 2006, but Th reserves 
are hard to predict since gammas don’t penetrate from that far down. 
Historically, the estimate has been 170,000 tons Th, but the exact origin 
of this estimate can’t be pinned down. Some prospectors claim much 
higher quantities as well as higher local concentrations in smaller ores. 
A drilling campaign would cost hundreds of millions USD.
Th from Fen needs to be highly automated since radiation and Radon 
levels are high. Tailings will be voluminous given low concentrations, and 
acidic waste after separations will need a repository sealed off from the 
drinking water supplies of the region.

Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Almost all these activities are devoted to the theoretical and experi­
mental justifications of the different modifications of the thorium MSR 
and its fuel cycle. Recently, the conception of MSR with U-Pu fuel has 
been developed.
13.1 Physics and chemistry of MSR materials
Molten salt properties (density, viscosity, thermal capacity, conductivity, 
etc.) have been studied in Russia for a long time. One of the first works 
was the determination of the fusion diagram of LiF-NaF-KF (Bergman 
and Dergunov, 1941). The essential contribution to this field was done by 
VNIINM (Gorbunov et al., 1976), Ural Polytechnic Institute (Smirnov 
et al., 1974; Desyatnik et al., 1979, 1981; Klimenkov et al., 1983), RIAR 
(Naumov et al., 1996). and especially by “Kurchatov Institute” (Naumov 
et al., 1996; Ignat'ev et al., 1984; Ignatiev et al., 2003, 2006a,b, 2008a, 
2013; Khokhlov et al., 2009; Afonichkin et al., 2009; Merzlyakov et al., 
2011, 2014; Ignatiev and Surenkov, 2012, 2013; Alexeev et al., 2014).
The measurements of the solubility of the actinide and lanthanide 
fluorides in molten salts were performed recently at VNIIKHT (Seregin 
et al., 2011a,b; Ponomarev et al., 2011, 2013), VNIITP (Volozhin et al., 
2013), and RIAR (Lizin et al., 2013a,b, 2015a,b).
13.2 Subcritical MSR systems for the minor actinides 
incineration
Due to the small fraction of the Am delayed neutrons (fi 0.14%) MSR 
burners of the minor actinides are considered mainly as subcritical ones. 
Many theoretical and experimental works have been performed in this 
line (Dubovsky, 1959; Vasil'kov et al., 1970; Kolesov et al., 1994, 1997, 
2000, 2002; KolesovV et al., 1995; Alekseev et al., 1995a,b; Kiselev, 
2001; Gerasimov and Kiselev, 2001; Mel’nik et al., 2003; ISTC 
Project#1486, 2004; Degtyarev et al., 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013a,b,c; 
Yurevich et al., 2006; Gulevich et al., 2008a,b; Gulevich et al., 2013).
The accelerator power Wa with proton energy Ea 1 GeV and the 
blanket core power Wb with subcriticality Ak are connected by the rela­
tion (Degtyarev et al., 2005):
Wa & 0.7-Ak- Wb

Figure 13.1 Schema of the experiment: salt cylinder (320 kg of NaF—ZrF4) with 220 
tablets of U-235 (18.6 kg, 90% enrichment), in which the sphere of Np-237 (5 kg) is 
imbedded with neutron source (Cf-252) inside.
At Wa 5 10 MW and Ak 5 0.05, the blanket power is restricted up to 
Wb & 300 MWth.
To enhance Wb to A • Wb at fixed Wa with amplification factor A, the 
cascade schema of MSR burner was considered (Dubovsky, 1959; 
Kolesov et al., 1994, 1997, 2000, 2002; KolesovV et al., 1995; Alekseev 
et al., 1995a,b; Mel’nik et al., 2003; ISTC Project#1486, 2004; 
Degtyarev et al., 2005, 2006). The experiment was performed at VNIIEF 
(Fig. 13.1) (Kolesov et al., 2002; ISTC Project#1486, 2004). The mea­
sured value A 5 2.0 6 0.1 is in fair agreement with theoretically estimated 
one.
The effective MSR burner of Am was considered on the base of 
eutectic LiF-NaF-KF in which the solubility of AmF3 is B40 mol.% at 
700°C (Lizin et al., 2013a). Such MSR burner can incinerate B300 kg 
Am/year ■ GWth using Am as fuel, without feeding by Pu and U-235 
(Degtyarev et al., 2013a).
13.3 Thorium-based reactor and its fuel cycle
The thorium fuel cycle was studied for many years in the Institute of 
Physics and Power Engineering (IPPE, Obninsk) and Moscow 
Engeenining Physics Institute (MEPHI, Moscow) (Mourogov et al., 

80
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
1983) as well as in the Institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
(Suglobov et al., 2007). The most systematic consideration was performed 
in the Russian Research Center “Kurchatov Institute” (Ignatiev et al., 
2007; ISTC Task #1606, 2007; Ignatiev et al., 2008b) especially in the 
framework of “MOSART” conception, based on the salt LiF-NaF-BeF2 
(Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b, 2014). This reactor has an intermediate neutron 
spectrum, and it is proposed as the minor actinides incinerator.
13.4 Fast MSR with U-Pu fuel cycle
The conception of the fast MSR based on chloride salt was considered in 
the work (Degtyarev and Ponomarev, 2012).
Until recently, the fast MSR with U-Pu fuel based on the fluoride 
molten salts was not considered because the PuF3 solubility in these salts 
does not exceed B3 mol.%. In the last 3 years, the extremely high solu­
bility of the actinide fluorides PuF3, UF4, and AmF3 in the eutectic 
46.5LiF—11.5NaF—42.0KF (FLiNaK) was established experimentally 
(B30, 45, and 40 mol.% respectively at 700°C) (Volozhin et al., 2013; 
Lizin et al., 2013a,b), as well as the lanthanide fluoride solubility (Seregin 
et al., 2011a,b; Ponomarev et al., 2011, 2013). These observations open at 
first the way for the development of the Fast MSR with U-Pu fuel cycle, 
which can operate in the equilibrium mode (Degtyarev et al., 2015; 
Ponomarev and Fedorov, 2015; Ponomarev et al., 2016). The closed fuel 
cycle of such MSR is simplified in comparison with the solid fuel reactors 
one, and its cost is essentially reduced (Ponomarev et al., 2016). The sub- 
critical fast MSR burner of minor actinides based on FLiNaK can inciner­
ate b300 kg Am/year ■ GWth (Degtyarev et al., 2013a).

14.1 Introduction
Steenkampskraal Thorium Limited (STL) is developing the HTMR-100 
(High-Temperature Modular Reactor) pebble bed reactor, a high- 
temperature gas-cooled reactor, graphite-moderated and cooled by forced 
helium flow. The existing design is set to produce high-quality steam cou­
pled to a steam-turbine/generator system to produce 35 MW of electric

power. The steam can be used in a wide range of cogeneration applications. 
The reactor is also suitable to provide direct high-temperature energy for 
process heat applications. The design of the reactor is based on proven tech­
nology, and therefore, no new basic technology development is needed. The 
size of the reactor and the fuel cycle were chosen to simplify the design and 
operation of the module and to facilitate the use of thorium. The approach 
to small intrinsic safe modular units ensures continuous production, easy road 
transportability, skid-mounted subsystems, a wider range of manufacturers, 
fast construction, and an enhanced licensing process (Fig. 14.1). Although 
this is not a molten salt reactor, it is included in this book because it can 
operate with thorium-based fuel.
14.2 Target applications
The HTMR-100 is capable of supplying electric power to any distri­
bution grid and standalone or isolated electricity users. It can be 
deployed as a single module or electricity generation multimodule 
plants as well as for medium-temperature process heat applications. 
The HTMR-100 is a perfect fit for clients who plan to progressively 
extend their generating capability. The unique safety characteristics of 
the reactor make it possible to introduce and construct these plants in 
non-nuclear countries. First World countries that want to use their 
stock of plutonium for peaceful applications are also markets for 
HTMR-100 reactors.

out” (OTTO) fueling scheme leads to a simple and cost-effective fuel 
management system. The relative low pressure in the primary loop pres­
sure requires a thinner-walled pressure vessel. This will ease the 
manufacturing process, thereby resulting in a wider range of vessel 
manufacturers.

14.4.2 Reactor core and power conversion unit
The reactor unit consists of a steel pressure vessel, a steel core barrel, 
graphite reflector blocks, neutron absorber rods, rod guide tubes, drive 
mechanisms, and in-vessel instrumentation. The vessel is designed for 
4 MPa pressure.
The graphite structure allows for differential expansion and volumetric 
changes due to temperature and neutron fluence-induced distortion. This 
is done to keep the stresses low and minimize primary fluid bypass and 
leaks. The side, top, and bottom reflector materials are made of nuclear 
grade graphite (Fig. 14.2). See Table 14.1.

Advanced concept phase
The gas coolant flows through the core from the top to the bottom 
where the heated gas is collected in a hot plenum. From the plenum, the 
hot gas flows through a connecting pipe to the steam generator. The 
power conversion system (PCS) uses a helical coil steam-generator unit 
supplying superheated steam to the turbine. The main system will be sup­
plied as four skid-mounted units, namely the condenser, turbine, gearbox, 
and electric generator. The turbine can be used in a back-pressure config­
uration, or intermediate-temperature steam can be taken off for process 
heat applications.
14.4.3 Fuel characteristics and supply
The fuel elements (FEs) for the HTMR-100 are 60 mm diameter graphite 
spheres consisting of a spherical fuel zone of approximately 50 mm diame­
ter. Each sphere contains TRISO-coated particles, which are randomly 
distributed in the graphitic matrix material. A fuel-free shell of graphite 
matrix of about 5 mm in thickness is then molded to the fuel zone. The 
fuel kernel and coatings serve as a fission product barrier in normal and 
accident operating conditions.

South Africa
91
There are various types of fuels that will be used in the HTMR-100 
reactor, ranging from LEU UO2 to mixtures of Th/LEU, Th/HEU, and 
Th/Pu. The following options have already been studied and shown to 
be viable:
• 
LEU: ,10% enrichment (7—10 g HM/sphere);
• 
Th/LEU: various options;
• 
50% LEU by mass 20% enrichment, 50% Th (10—12 g HM/sphere);
• 
25% LEU by mass 20% enrichment, 75% Th (16—20 g HM/sphere);
• 
Th/HEU, 10% HEU by mass 93% enrichment, 90% Th by mass 
(10—12 g HM/sphere);
• 
Th/Pu: 15% reactor grade Pu by mass (12 g HM/sphere).
A fuel qualification and test program will be conducted on the fuel 
prior to loading of the reactor.
The HTMR-100 operates on a much longer burn-up fuel cycle com­
pared with conventional reactors. The nonproliferation characteristic of 
the OTTO cycle is the extended time the pebbles reside inside the core, 
making it more difficult to divert partially burnt fuel.
14.4.4 Fuel handling system
The fuel handling and storage system (FHSS) is a support system to the 
main power system of the HTMR-100.
A 6-month supply of fresh fuel is kept in the fresh fuel storage facility. 
New spherical fuel elements (fresh fuel) are loaded by the fuel-loading 
machine into a charge lock. The charge lock is purged, filled with clean 
helium, and pressurized to system pressure, before it is opened and fuel is 
gravity-fed into the core cavity. The charge lock has a physical capacity 
for approximately one full-power day’s fuel sphere inventory.
Spent fuel is removed from the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) by means 
of two fuel-unloading machines (FUMs), connected to a single reactor 
defueling chute. Each FUM discharges spent fuel into a discharge lock. 
The discharge locks have sufficient capacity for a full-power day of spent 
fuel elements.
Spent fuel, damaged in such a manner that gravity conveyance is com­
promised, is mechanically separated inside the FUM and accumulated in a 
dedicated scrap canister, located inside the FUM.
Provision is made in the design of the FHSS for the temporary fitment 
of activity-measuring devices. These are to be used for the removal of the 
first core graphite spheres. Separate burn-up measuring devices can also be 

92

temporarily installed for core performance and calculational purposes 
when running fuel composition trials.
During decommissioning, the FHSS extracts the last used fuel in the 
same manner as per normal operation (Fig. 14.3).
14.4.5 Reactivity control
Control is provided by 18 neutron absorber control rods. The control 
rods are placed within graphite sleeves inside the graphite side reflector 
blocks. The absorber rods can be operated independently as a group or as 
subgroups, as required by the reactor operating control system. A control 
rod consists of several rod absorber material segments, which are pinned 
together to form articulating joints. The control rods consist of sintered 
B4C absorber material, sandwiched between an inner and an outer tube 
segment. The inner tube segment allows helium cooling gas to flow from

the top down in the circular channels. Each rod is equipped with a posi­
tion indicator, which measures the position of the rod over its entire posi­
tioning range including the upper and lower limit positions.
14.4.6 Reactor pressure vessel and internals
The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is constructed according to the ASME 
III subsection NB code. It comprises two main components:
1. Reactor vessel body;
2. Vessel head, which is bolted to the vessel body.
The reactor vessel body consists of several forged ring components cir­
cumferentially welded together.
The core structures consist of the metallic parts and the graphite struc­
tures. The function of these internal structures is to provide stable core 
geometry, neutron reflection, cold and hot gas channeling, fuel element 
flow, shielding, thermal insulation, and support of the control and shut­
down systems guide tubes and the neutron source. The functional design 
of the structural core internals is such that they are capable of withstand­
ing the steady state and transient loadings during normal operation, antici­
pated operational occurrences, and design basis accidents.
The shape and structure of the inner side reflector wall and the 30 
degrees angled core bottom permit uniform fuel element flow.
The loads borne by the ceramic internals are transferred to the steel 
core barrel and then to the RPV through metallic components, such as 
the lower support structure and the core barrel axial and radial supports.
All areas of the core internals are designed for the service life of the 
reactor. Access for ceramic structure inspections can be done through the 
fuel-loading channel and the reflector rod holes.
14.5 Plant safety features
14.5.1 Engineered safety system configuration and approach 
In principle, the plant is designed to perform its safety functions without 
reliance on the automated plant control system or the operator. The engi­
neered safety system of the plant has no engineered safety systems in terms

der core geometry, and the use of materials capable of withstanding high

temperatures ensure complete passive residual heat removal capability 
without exceeding the design limits of components.
Provision for beyond-design basis conditions is made, including the 
nonfunctioning/noninsertion of all active control and shutdown systems. 
The reactor core characteristics, e.g., small excess reactivity and strong 
negative reactivity coefficient with temperature, will shutdown the reactor 
and maintain a condition where no damage to the fuel, core structures, 
and reactor vessel occurs.
Excessive reactivity increase during water or water vapor ingress 
(increasing moderation) is prevented by designing the reactor for limited 
heavy metal content of the fuel.
14.5.2 Reactor cooling philosophy
The reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS) removes heat radiated from 
the reactor toward the reactor cavity walls. It consists of welded mem­
brane tubes arranged side by side on the inside of the reactor cavity wall. 
Water is circulated through the tubes to form a cold wall. The RCCS is a 
passive system and consists of three independent cooling trains and is 
designed for all postulated design basis conditions.
14.5.3 Containment function
The primary fission product barrier is the TRISO-coated fuel particles, 
which keep the fission products contained under all postulated events, 
even if the second barrier (the primary pressure vessel system) and the 
third barrier (the building filter system) collapse.
14.6 Plant operational performances
The central consideration is the demand for high availability of process 
steam supply and/or electricity generation. To reduce or minimize the 
nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) daily or weekly load changes of the 
reactor, the preference is to change the ratio between steam supply and 
electricity supply. Excess steam and/or electricity can be used in the desa­
lination plants to provide water as a sellable commodity earning additional 
revenue. This allows the plant to operate virtually continually at full 
power very close to the plant availability.
In order to maintain the plant safety and operational performance, spe­
cific areas are controlled for human occupation and protection.

14.7 Instrumentation and control systems
The automation system (ATS) comprises a group of safety and nonsafety 
C&I systems that provide automated protection, control, monitoring, and 
human—system interfaces. The following three specific systems in the 
HTMR-100 system structure define control and instrumentation:
1. Plant control, data, and instrumentation system: Provides overall plant con­
trol and monitoring. It includes an architecture that combines C&I 
systems and the control room equipment.
2. Equipment/investment protection system: Reduces the risk of losing critical 
or expensive components by maintaining the plant within its normal 
and safe operating envelope.
3. Protection system: Initiates reactor SCRAM to protect against nuclear 
control failure or loss of primary coolant, etc.
The HTMR-100 ATS architecture implements modern digital C&I 
designs and equipment. The architecture of the overall automation system 
is based on redundancy, diversity, separation, and functional and physical 
independence. This concept includes four levels of defense-in-depth: (1) 
distributed control system or control system; (2) reactor protection system 
(RPS); (3) manual shutdown system; and (4) post-event information 
system.
14.8 Site and plant layout
The HTMR-100 is configured to simplify the construction of the various 
buildings and to ensure easy installation of the reactor, steam generator, 
and handling of spent fuel. The proposed plant layout aims to protect 
safety-important functions while simplifying operational and maintenance 
tasks. The plant layout allows for the addition of multiple reactors (and 
associated equipment) in a compact multimodule fashion.
14.8.1 Reactor building
The reactor building contains the safety equipment that provides the nec­
essary functions for the safe shutdown of the reactor under all design basis 
conditions. The reactor building is partially submerged below ground 
level such that the reactor and steam generator cavities are completely 
protected against postulated external threats. The depth can be further 
adapted to suit the geological conditions of the specific site to provide for 
the necessary level of seismic protection.

96
Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
The reactor building, electrical building, and auxiliary buildings are 
connected by means of underground tunnels, providing protection for 
interlinked services, and it also ensures that spent fuel is never brought 
above ground level. Provision is made for the storage of all spent fuel pro­
duced during the operating life of the plant. The reactor building is seis- 
mically designed to withstand a design basis earthquake (DBE) and, 
together with the spent fuel storage bunker, is the only safety-related 
building structure of the HTMR-100 (Fig. 14.4).
14.8.2 Electrical building
The electrical building houses the main control and computer rooms, pri­
mary and secondary plant security alarm rooms, and provides the primary 
access facilities for the nuclear island and the energy conversion area. This 
center also provides space for activities associated with plant administration 
and security services. The plant control, data, and instrumentation system 
control/display panels and computers are housed in the control room.
14.8.3 Turbine generator building
The turbine generator building provides the foundation and housing for 
the PCS, including other support systems such as the compressed air, 
water sampling, HVAC, voltage distribution systems, permanent 11 
kVAC and 400 VAC diesel generator sets, and steam safety valves.

97
14.8.4 Balance of plant
The balance of plant consists of the secondary systems and the tertiary 
systems.
The PCS has one set of isolation valves between itself and the NSSS. 
The PCS and its major subsystems are of non-nuclear safety class and thus 
conventional safety class, and the product is of a high-quality industrial 
standard.
14.8.5 Electric power systems
The electrical power supply system (EPSS) for the single-module 
HTMR-100 plant supplies power to the plant safety and nonsafety equip­
ment for normal plant operation, start-up, normal shutdown, as well as 
for accident mitigation and safe shutdown.
The EPSS provides the following voltage levels: 230 VAC, 400 VAC, 
11 kVAC, 24/48 VDC, and 250 VDC. The primary voltage of the sta­
tion feeder transformer is transmission grid dependent and thus site­
specific.
The majority of plant loads are powered from the main power supply 
system (MPSS), while all safety-related loads as well as nonsafety-related 
loads on the nuclear island (NI) portion of the EPSS are powered by the 
reactor power supply system (RPSS). The RPS and some nonsafety- 
related loads (i.e., primary blowers 1 and 2, etc.) are powered from the 
RPSS. A portion of the RPSS circuit (inside the reactor building) is cate­
gorized as safety-related (Class 1E).
14.9 Design and licensing status
Conceptual design is in an advanced stage. The core nucleonic, thermo- 
hydraulic, and heat transfer analyses are carried out to optimize the perfor­
mance and verify the safety analysis. Nuclear regulator engagement is 
planned with the aim of commencing the preassessment for licensing in 
order to reach design certification status at the end of the concept phase.
14.10 Plant economics
Since the HTMR-100 is mainly intended to service the needs of isolated 
geographical areas, it is not meant to compete economically with large 
( . 1 GW) reactors connected to an existing national grid. The HTR 

98 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
SMR comes into its own right when the various combinations of electric­
ity, process heat, and water desalination are considered and holds great 
promise for the long-term economics of users.
Preliminary capital and operating cost studies indicate that this flexibil­
ity of the HTMR-100 provides the most efficient energy to isolated com­
munities and industries. It is well suited to deployment in developing 
countries with its affordability and Gen IV safety characteristics.

15.1 Preliminaries
Until recently, research in advanced nuclear reactors (such as accelerator- 
driven systems or Gen-IV reactors) has not been very intensive in 
Sweden. In the pre-Harrisburg era, some aspects of fast reactor concepts 
were tested in critical assemblies at the national research center Studsvik. 
After the Three Mile Island accident, a national vote (referendum) was 
held on nuclear energy, which resulted in a recommendation of phasing 
out nuclear power on the long run. This had the consequence that in the 
continuation, education and research in nuclear engineering could only 
get funding from the industry (coordinated by the Swedish Centre for 
Nuclear Technology, SKC) and the safety authority. For obvious reasons, 
the activity was restricted to the safety of the existing installations.
Research on accelerator-driven systems (ADS) and transmutation was 
started up at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, 
with support from the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management 
Co, as well as from EU, in the early 1990s. About the same time, 
Chalmers (Goteborg) and Uppsala joined research on transmutation tech­
niques, and Chalmers also participated in FP 4, 5, and 7 projects on ADS.
Regarding Gen-IV systems, the main interest in Sweden lies in lead- 
cooled fast reactors. In 2009, in the midst of a short hopeful period in the

100 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
pre-Fukushima era, the Swedish Research council financed a 3-year long 
framework project called GENIUS, aimed at research in lead-cooled reac­
tors. All three universities with nuclear engineering faculty (KTH, 
Uppsala, and Chalmers) participated in the project. Very recently, the 
Swedish Energy Agency granted support for a competence centre 
(Academic-industrial Nuclear technology Initiative to Achieve a sustain­
able energy future), for research concerning small modular reactors, and 
the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research supports a project 
(Sustainable Nuclear Energy Research In Sweden) on development work 
for a lead-cooled research and demonstration reactor in Sweden.
15.2 MSR kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise
The former Division of Nuclear Engineering (currently Division of 
Subatomic, High Energy and Plasma Physics) of the Department of Physics, 
Chalmers University of Technology has long been doing research and devel­
opment work on reactor dynamics and noise diagnostics in cooperation with 
the nuclear industry (the Ringhals power plant) and the safety authority (the 
Swedish Radiation Safety Authority). Research on the dynamics and neutron 
fluctuations in molten salt systems was started in 2008, partly as a PhD research 
project (Jonsson, 2012; Pazsit and Jonsson, 2011; Jonsson and Pazsit, 2011; 
Pazsit et al., 2012). Some of the work was performed in international coopera­
tion, with a visiting Professor from CEA Saclay, France (Pazsit et al., 2014). 
This research is described in Chapter 5 of “Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium 
Energy”, hence only a brief summary of the main findings is given here.
In this research, the kinetic behavior of molten salt systems was inves­
tigated in simple models, in which analytical or semianalytical solutions 
can be obtained. This facilitates the insight and understanding of the phys­
ics of such systems. A number of characteristics of MSR dynamics were 
identified and interpreted in comparison with traditional solid fuel sys­
tems. It was shown that due to the movement of the delayed neutron 
precursors, such systems become more tightly coupled from the neutron 
physics point of view, which manifests itself in their dynamic response. 
Due to the smaller effective fraction of delayed neutron precursors, the 
neutron fluctuations induced by perturbations in a critical core have a 
larger amplitude than in traditional reactors with solid fuel, hence neutron 
diagnostics might be an effective tool for monitoring and surveillance 
of such systems. It was also shown that application of the traditional 
point kinetic approximation, which assumes factorization between the 

Sweden 101
space- and time dependence, meets difficulties due to the fact that the 
propagating property of the delayed neutron precursors is in contradiction 
with factorization.
In the period of May 2018—April 2021, the Division of Subatomic, 
High Energy and Plasma Physics contributed to the SEALION project 
(Seaborg External multiphysics Architecture for Licensing and Ip develop­
ment Of Nuclear reactors). The project was financed by the Eurostars-2 
Joint Programme with co-funding from the European Union’s Horizon 
2020 research and innovation program. The project was led by Seaborg 
Technologies (Denmark), with the participation of the Technical 
University of Denmark (Denmark), DAES (Switzerland), and Chalmers 
(Sweden). Chalmers’ involvement consisted in the development of a new 
verification method applicable to MSR neutronic modeling software. 
This method consists of the modeling of the system response to external, 
stationary, and monochromatic fluctuations of macroscopic cross sections 
throughout the reactor core. By using proper orthogonalization techni­
ques, various components associated to the system response are extracted 
(Demaziere et al., 2021, 2022). It was demonstrated that some analytical 
dependence between those components as a function of frequency of the 
applied perturbation exists. By varying the frequency of the perturbation, 
it is possible to check whether the processed code outputs follow the 
expected analytical dependence, from which the proper code implemen­
tation can be verified.
There was no Swedish technical participation in any other European 
MSR projects, but the Division of Nuclear Engineering from Chalmers 
had a member in the stakeholders' committee of the 3 years long FP7 
Project on the Evaluation of the Viability Of Liquid fuel fast reactor sys­
tem (EVOL), dedicated to the design of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor 
(MSFR) concept. The EVOL project ran between 2011 and 2013. The 
Division has also been invited to present their research at the CMSNT- 
2013 (Conference on Molten Salts in Nuclear Technology), January 
9-11, 2013, Mumbai, India.
15.3 Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR 
fuel cycle
The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Uppsala University has 
been doing research on technical nonproliferation and safeguards for over 
30 years. The efforts have primarily targeted research and development 

102 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
associated with the light water reactor fuel cycle, but over the years 
increasing attention has been directed toward Generation IV nuclear 
energy systems. To a limited extent, this has included MSR systems, 
although the objective has been to investigate issues of general relevance 
or concern. Examples of activities that have been made so far, or are 
planned within existing research projects, are assessments of proliferation 
resistance, fuel cycle vulnerability studies, material attractiveness evalua­
tions, and the development of measures and tools to properly safeguard 
the future systems.
15.4 Thorium research
In 2006, the largest Swedish nuclear utility Vattenfall, together with the 
Norwegian privately owned company Thor Energy, initiated a feasibility 
study of various thorium systems. The focus was on reactor types that 
were either already on the market or perceived to be ready for commer­
cialization within the next 10—15 years. Parts of the study were carried 
out by researchers within Vattenfall, some parts were carried out at 
Swedish universities, and some parts were subcontracted to researchers in 
other countries. The research performed at the Swedish universities 
included two MSc thesis projects involving neutronic simulations, one 
focusing on the nuclear design and evaluation of a BWR with four differ­
ent variants of thorium-based fuel (Insulander Bjork, 2008) and the other 
one involving similar simulations but for a PWR (Liu, 2008). The feasibil­
ity study did not indicate any showstoppers for the use of thorium in any 
of the investigated systems. Based on the study, Vattenfall decided not to 
engage more with thorium fuel, whereas Thor Energy decided to proceed 
with irradiation testing of thorium-based oxide fuel with plutonium as a 
fissile component (Th-MOX). An irradiation test rig was loaded in the 
Halden research reactor in 2013, comprising Th-MOX pellets and also 
some uranium oxide fuel with thorium added as a minor component.
As a further outcome of the feasibility study, Thor Energy, with the 
support of the Norwegian Research council, sponsored an industrial PhD 
project at the Division of Nuclear Engineering at Chalmers, which 
involved neutronic simulations of the usage of Th-MOX fuel in BWRs 
and PWRs, as well as analysis of the data from the test irradiation and 
related thermal—mechanical simulations of the fuel material (Insulander 
Bjork, 2015). In parallel, another PhD project was performed at the 
Division of Nuclear Engineering at Chalmers, on the feasibility of using 

Sweden 103
of thorium in PWRs, funded by the Oskarshamn Power plant and 
Vattenfall (Lau, 2015). The origin of this project was that some sponsoring 
members of the Swedish Centre for Nuclear Technology expressed inter­
est in knowing more about the thorium cycle and research in India in this 
respect. In this study, the main focus was on the use of thorium as a 
minor component in uranium oxide fuel, which was proven to provide 
some benefits, in particular with regard to power peaking factors.
This concept attracted the interest of Thor Energy, which was the rea­
son why a fuel material typical for this application was included in the 
irradiation test rig in the Halden research reactor. Some simulations were 
also performed by Thor Energy on the neutronic merits of thorium as an 
additive to uranium oxide fuel in BWRs (Insulander Bjork, 2015), and 
several different fuel materials typical for this application were loaded in a 
second test rig in 2015, together with other uranium based fuel types 
with different additives for improving fuel performance.
15.5 The chemistry of the thorium cycle with a view to 
MSR
At the Department of Nuclear Chemistry at Chalmers, the specialty has 
for a long time been the chemistry of the fuel cycle from mining to final 
repository, including separation for transmutation. In this context, several 
processes based on aqueous reprocessing have been developed mainly for 
uranium and uranium/plutonium-based fuels. One of the reasons for this 
is that the nuclear chemistry laboratory at Chalmers is one of very few in 
the world that can handle all chemical elements present in used nuclear 
fuel in reasonable amounts. Thus, advanced fuels such as (Pu, Zr)N and 
minor actinide-bearing oxides can also be manufactured ( the first pure 
PuN pellet in the world was made here in 2015).
For thorium fuels, the fabrication is rather straightforward. The choice 
of starter nuclide is naturally pivotal for the choice of facility to work in. 
Today there are several choices for such a starter, e.g., 239Pu, 233U or 
235U. In the latter cases, (U,Th)O2 fuels have been prepared at Chalmers 
by the powder mixing route. However, as the percentage of the starter 
increases or if the fuel is used for minor actinide burning, other produc­
tion routes such as the dust-free sol—gel may be used. This technique is 
also used in the Chalmers laboratories.
The recycling of thorium-based fuels is a major challenge, as is dis­
cussed in the literature. The conclusion is that for normal Th-based fuel 

104 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
the U and the Th will be recycled for further use, while the remaining 
elements will be vitrified. The separation process is rather simple and can 
be tested at Chalmers. However, the actual dissolution of the thorium 
fuel is not as simple, due to the very high stability of ThO2 (which makes 
it ideal for direct storage without recycling). So far, the dominating sug­
gested route has still been the HF/HNO3-based THOREX dissolution. 
More novel methods exist but have not been tried industrially or in pilot 
plant scale.
In the case of the MSR, laboratories exist with the capability to 
develop processes based on the uranium and thorium fuel cycles. In 
essence this means that an MSR fuel simulation can be made mimicking 
any stage of the operational cycle. This salt can then be used for separa­
tions studies in batch processes. No equipment for continuous processes 
exists. In principle the methods that potentially can be used for MSR 
cycles are:
1. Physical methods with fractionated distillation or sublimation and crys­
tallization as well as methods of liquid—liquid extraction and distribu­
tion in immiscible molten metals and molten salts;
2. Chemical methods such as cyclic oxidation and reduction methods 
using chemical and electrochemical processes.
Depending on fuel type, that is, uranium or thorium-based, these 
methods may be more or less suitable. However, due to practical reasons, 
the preferred techniques at Chalmers would be electrochemical separation 
from the molten salt or molten salt/molten metal extractive separation. 
The present equipment is placed in a glove box with possibilities to con­
trol the main atmosphere as well as oxygen potential, etc. A picture of 
this equipment is shown in Fig. 15.1 below.
15.6 Research into heat and mass transfer in molten salts
Extensive studies of natural convection in molten salt pools (Gubaidullin, 
2002; Sehgal et al., 1998; Gubaidullin and Sehgal, 2002) have been com­
pleted at the Division of Nuclear Power Safety at the Royal Institute of 
Technology in Stockholm, with primary interest to severe accident 
research. A series of experiments employing eutectic and non-eutectic salt 
mixture in an NaNO3-KNO3 system were performed in the SIMECO 
facility (Fig. 15.2). Tests with stratified molten pools with 2 and 3 immis­
cible layers were carried out to study and develop heat transfer models for

molten pools undergoing a miscibility gap. The heat focusing effect of a 
metal layer atop of the molten salt pool was investigated experimentally.
Advanced numerical models were elaborated and tested, which enable 
quantitative analysis of a two-layer salt-stratified system in a wide range of 
flow regimes, including flow instabilities and turbulent effects. The turbu­
lent characteristics inherent to the convection at Rayleigh numbers of 

106 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
interest were obtained by direct numerical simulation (DNS). The results 
were compared against experimental data. The underlying physics of the 
flow characteristics was explained, and the shortcomings of existing turbu­
lence models were pointed out.
Currently the Division of Nuclear Power Safety is developing a new 
experimental program to study heat and mass transfer in stratified molten 
salt pool involving the SIMECO-2 facility (Yu et al., 2016; Lopukh et al., 
2018; Bian et al., 2022a, 2022b) (Fig. 15.3). The research has been started 
within the European program Horizon-2020 in the frame of the IVMR 
project. The experiments are planned to conduct with new simulant 
materials—the CsCl-KCl-LiCl system and Al-Mg alloy representing 
immiscible liquids of oxidic and metallic layers, respectively. The new 
unique feature of the facility is contactless method of induction heating to 
minimize the hydrodynamic impact of traditional heaters on the natural 
convection. An essential part of the research program is devoted to 
modeling of the natural convection including development of new 
computational approaches and model validation with new experimental 
data.
Pre-test simulation of the stratified molten pool was performed with 
Phase Effective Convectivity Model (PECM) (Tran and Dinh, 2009a, 
2009b). It gives information important for the facility design (temperature 
and heat flux distributions, position and thickness of interfacial crust, total 
consumed power) using relatively low computational capacity (Fig. 15.4).

16.1 Introduction
Switzerland, represented by the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), is a member 
of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and participates in the 
GIF Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) project. It is also involved in IAEA 
MSR activities and in the European consortium dedicated to MSR 
research. In 2015, together with the GIF general framework agreement, 
the Swiss participation in GIF was extended for another 10 years, and PSI 
revised its priorities. It was traditionally involved in High-Temperature 
Reactor (HTR) and Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) GIF projects. 
However, the participation in GFR project was terminated and replaced 
by the GIF MSR project. Within Switzerland, PSI collaborates with the 
Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Board), espe­
cially with the federal polytechnic schools of Lausanne and Zurich.
The major objective of the MSR research is the safety and fuel cycle 
sustainability. Accordingly, several tools have been developed or modified 
at PSI for MSR application. These are:
• 
EQL0D & EQL3D equilibrium cycle procedures for fuel cycle simulation. 
• AMoDy Atomistic Molecular Dynamics tool.

• 
GEMS Gibbs Energy Minimization Software for thermodynamics 
simulation.
• 
cGEMS (GEMS-MELCORE) coupling for severe accident simulation.
• 
TRACE-PARCS system code for MSR transient analysis.
• 
GeN-Foam / Atari multi-physics tools for MSR core analysis.
These tools represent rather carefully selected areas of discrete compe­
tencies that exhausting list of tools and methods needed for the ultimate 
goal. Therefore, PSI relies also on strong international collaboration.
The present MSR-related research was launched at the Nuclear 
Energy and Safety (NES) division of PSI at the end of 2012. Nonetheless, 
historically, the non-water-cooled reactors have been persistently analyzed 
at PSI and its predecessor, the Federal Institute for Reactor Research 
(EIR). Besides the safety goal, there have always been two major fuel 
cycle objectives: maximal usage of natural resources and minimal waste 
production.
The historical MSR research effort was dedicated to chloride salts and 
fast neutron spectrum systems such as MCFR (Molten Chloride Fast 
Reactor). It started at EIR in the seventies and was driven by Professor 
Taube. Already before joining EIR, Taube proposed a concept of homo­
geneous MCFR reactor (see Fig. 16.1A) with direct cooling by boiling 
AlCl3 salt (Taube et al., 1967). Early at EIR, Taube considered the same 
salt as coolant for fast solid fuel reactor (Taube and Schumacher, 1969). In 
early seventies, the EIR research focused on heterogeneous MCFR for 
breeding and burning application (see Fig. 16.1B, C, and D). The blanket 
salt, which was either carrying fertile material (Fig. 16.1B) or waste dedi­
cated for transmutation (Fig. 16.1C), served as the primary coolant 
(Taube, 1974a). The breeding and burning features were also combined 
in three-zone concept (Fig. 16.1D). In the middle of seventies, concepts 
combining U-Pu and Th-U cycles were proposed (Taube, 1974b) in the
Figure 16.1 Overview of the past MSR chloride concepts assessed at PSI predecessor

form of spherical homogeneous two-zone MSR (see Fig. 16.1E). The 
waste minimization was nonetheless still one of the objectives (Taube 
et al., 1975) and resulted in another proposal of dedicated burner concept 
with driven central burning zone (Fig. 16.1F). Finally, in early eighties, 
the homogeneous MCFR breeder with salt reflector and fuel based on 
natural chlorides (Fig. 16.1G) was proposed (Taube and Heer, 1980), 
before the MSR research at EIR was terminated.
In the last 20 years, the advanced reactor research at PSI focused 
mainly on the HTR and on the Fast Reactors cooled by Gas (GFR), 
Lead (LFR), or Sodium (SFR), optionally coupled with external neutron 
source. The research dedicated to MSR, which is the subject of this chap­
ter, was restarted at the end of 2012. The recent activities were initiated 
at NES Laboratory for Reactor Physics and System Behavior (LRS) and 
related mainly to the fuel cycle in Thorium-Uranium-fueled MSRs 
(Krepel et al., 2013; Fiorina et al., 2013). It was accompanied by the 
development of two different approaches for MSR transient analysis based 
on the coupled system code TRACE-PARCS (Kim, 2015; Zanetti et al., 
2015) and on OpenFOAM high-fidelity solver GeN-Foam (Fiorina et al., 
2015a,b, 2016). Later the application of GEMS code (Kulik et al., 2013), 
development of AMoDy code and of cGEMS code (Kalilainen et al., 
2020, Nichenko, 2020) followed.
Since one of the major objectives is maximal usage of natural resources 
and minimal waste production, concepts with outstanding neutron econ­
omy are in objective of PSI research. Accordingly, the focus migrated 
from the initial graphite-based MSR to the homogeneous fluoride or 
chloride fast reactors operated as Th-U or U-Pu breeders or in so-called 
U-Pu Breed and Burn (B&B) cycle. PSI belongs to the pioneering orga­
nization in this area and was the first to report in open literature the MSR 
B&B capability (Hombourger et al., 2015b, 2017, Hombourger, 2018, 
2019), and this type of fuel cycle is nowadays one of the major research 
directions.
16.2 Motivation, research areas, and projects
PSI, and in particular the NES division, is a Swiss competence center for 
nuclear energy. As such, it has several major missions. One of rather 
minor missions is dedicated to the technology monitoring and contribu­
tion to international effort dedicated to advanced reactors research. In 
2021, the new division of Scientific Computing, Theory, and Data (SCD) 

112 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
was established at PSI. As a result, the activities related to advanced reac­
tors are now divided between NES and SCD divisions, where majority of 
the MSR-related research is accomplished in the SCD Laboratory for 
Simulation and Modeling (LSM) and particularly in its Advanced Nuclear 
System (ANS) group. The SCD division should, between others, provide 
modeling know-how and computing resources for the science, engineer­
ing, and accelerator program. Accordingly, innovative computation­
demanding research projects such as MSR represent a small but important 
asset for both of these divisions.
PSI focuses on the three advanced reactor systems: HTR, SFR, and 
MSR have different motivation. HTR is perceived as a potential short­
time alternative to Light Water Reactors (LWRs) with distinct safety 
architecture and possibility to deliver process heat; nonetheless, with com­
parably low fuel usage as LWR and voluminous spent fuel. On the other 
hand, SFR is perceived as technologically most developed reactor, which 
enables fuel recycling and high sustainability. Its monitoring is partially 
driven also by the involvement and interest of the neighboring country 
France. MSR was selected as additional system especially for its potential 
to combine high resources usage, low waste production, and risk reduc­
tion with the exclusion of severe accidents. It may fulfill the “low waste, 
low risk” requirement of the broad public toward a better acceptance of 
nuclear energy generation in the future. Furthermore, since MSR oper­
ates at low pressure and since both the safety approach and fuel cycle may 
be potentially simplified, in the long term, its price may become lower 
than the current or planed LWRs or SFRs.
The MSR safety potential, as the PSI long-term research target, can­
not be evaluated without knowing the system design, fuel chemistry, salt 
thermal-hydraulics features, safety and fuel cycle approach, and the rele­
vant material and chemical limits. The above listed competencies and 
tools at PSI can be thus grouped into four topical areas:
• 
Core design and fuel cycle,
• 
Fuel behavior at nominal and accidental conditions,
• 
Transient behavior and decay heat removal system,
• 
Safety, fuel stream, and relevant limits.
The safety is obviously superior to the other tree areas and represents 
their central point. As already mentioned, PSI competencies are rather 
timely, and the research obviously relies on intensive international coop­
eration. Therefore, soon after the MSR research was restarted, PSI joined 
as an observer in the EU FP7 project on the Evaluation of the Viability 

Switzerland 113
Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system (EVOL) dedicated to the design of the 
Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) concept. Since 2015, PSI participated 
in the EVOL follow-up project entitled Safety Assessment of the MOlten 
salt FAst Reactor (SAMOFAR) dedicated to innovative MSFR safety 
features. PSI is also member of the SAMOSAFER project (Severe 
Accident Modeling and Safety Assessment for Fluid-fuel Energy Reactors) 
consortium.
In 2014, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) financed a 
PhD study “Small Modular Molten Salt Reactor Designing for Low 
Waste Production,” which started in April 2014. Its major outcome was 
the pioneering work on identification of B&B fuel cycle in MSR 
(Hombourger et al., 2015b, 2017, Hombourger, 2018, 2019). In May 
2015, a 2-year research project dedicated to HTR and MSR “Feasibility 
and plausibility of innovative reactor concepts in an European electricity 
supply environment” was launched. It was financed by the Project and 
Study Fund of the Electricity Industry (PSEL) of the Association of Swiss 
Electricity Producers (VSE), Swiss electricity grid operators (swisselectric), 
and ETH Zurich. It resulted in several innovative solution for HTR sim­
ulation, e.g., (Vitullo et al., 2020), and additional MSR B&B concept 
assessment (Hombourger et al., 2017).
For the chemistry of molten salts, it is relevant that in 2008, PSI 
joined, as a partner, the 4-year FP7 Project Actinide recycling by 
SEParation and Transmutation (ACSEPT). The project lasted until 2012, 
and in its frame, the HERACLES database for the PSI in-house chemical 
thermodynamics modeling code GEMS was created. PSI joined in 2013 
the 3-year FP7 follow-up project Safety of ACtinide SEparation 
proceSSes (SACSESS), which lasted until 2016. The PSI contribution 
focused on Mo and MgO behavior in LiCl-KCl salts and on the behavior 
of actinide fluorides in LiF-AlF3 salts.
16.3 Core design and fuel cycle
The core design and fuel cycle-related activities at PSI focus on the iden­
tification of MSR designs appropriate for sustainable energy production 
and simultaneously limiting the waste production and granting high levels 
of safety. Since this kind of research is only an indirect objective of the 
recent European projects, it is driven mainly by the national projects 
sponsored by SNSF (PhD study) and PSEL project or in form of students’ 
theses in the frame of the Swiss nuclear master course.

114 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
This research can be divided into two main phases. Initial phase was 
dedicated to a parametric scoping study evaluating major design options 
such as salts, moderators, feed materials, fuel cycle, and core layout. The 
second phase objective was to identify promising reactor designs out of 
the parametric studies. The selection criteria were: dimension, materials 
lifetime, fissile inventory, reprocessing intensity, etc. The main design cri­
terion in addition to safety is, nonetheless, the neutron economy. 
Excellent neutron economy should enable both breeding of fissile fuel 
from fertile nuclides (232Th or 238U) and reduction of legacy and own 
waste volume. The term waste is here used for synthetic actinides, which 
are generated as by-products of 235U, 232Th or 238U usage. The pivotal 
tool for related simulations is the PSI in-house equilibrium closed-cycle 
routine EQL0D (Hombourger et al., 2015a, 2016, 2020). It is a 
MATLAB script coupled with the Monte-Carlo code SERPENT capable 
of simulating continuous reprocessing; for instance, removal of gaseous fis­
sion products (FPs) from the MSR core. This tool was initially applied to 
moderated MSR, with conclusion that breeding in thermal spectrum is 
possible in the Th-U cycle, but requires intensive FPs removal and possi­
bly 233Pa separation. For some moderators, a separation material with 
nearly zero neutron absorption is required (Hombourger, 2018). 
Therefore, often SiC is considered as a prodigy.
The performance of fast-spectrum MSR seems more robust. The ratio 
of fissile actinides in these concepts is generally higher, and they are thus 
less sensitive to the FPs buildup (Krepel, 2021b). Several selected carrier 
salt compositions including both fluoride and chloride salts were evalu­
ated: 7LiF-BeF2, 7LiF, 7LiF-NaF, NaF-BeF2, NaF-KF, NaCl, and Na37Cl. 
The labels 7Li and 37Cl indicate assumption of isotopic enrichment. These 
carrier salts were mixed with the fuel salt to form an eutectic mixture 
with lowest melting point. Both U-Pu and Th-U fuel cycles were simu­
lated using EQL0D and evaluated by means of the equilibrium closed- 
cycle excess reactivity p for infinite medium. To provide further insight, 
major contributors to the parasitic neutron capture were identified (see 
Fig. 16.2). The MSR performance from this perspective was also com­
pared with other reactors (Krepel and Losa, 2021). It is obvious that the 
Th-U fuel cycle profits from low 233U capture cross section and can per­
form well even in epithermal or thermal spectrum (Krepel, 2021a). At the 
same time, only about 2.5 neutrons are available per fission in this cycle. 
The U-Pu cycle profits from 2.9 neutrons origination per fission, but is 
more sensitive to spectrum softening.

Figure 16.2 Excess reactivity in infinite media for Th-U (left) and U-Pu (right) fuel 
cycles and selected carrier salts. The difference between excess and hypothetical 
reactivity (for zero parasitic capture) is isotope-wise decomposed.
Best-performing fluoride carrier salt is 7LiF, the reference carrier salt of 
the SAMOFAR and SAMOSAFER projects. Fuel salts based on this car­
rier salt profit from low capture cross section of 7Li and 19F, but the salt 
has higher melting temperature than the respective 7LiF-BeF2 used in 
ORNL times. When compared with 9Be, 7Li and 19F are not moderators 
per se; however, both are light nuclides with strong scattering resonances 
in fast neutron spectrum range. Therefore, they are strongly suppressing 
fast neutrons share. This can be seen on the mediocre U-Pu cycle perfor­
mance with these salts. Since 7LiF was considered as reference salt in the 
European projects, it was used at PSI for several fuel cycle studies. 
A parametric spectral study at equilibrium cycle and at full core level was 
accomplished with an ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure (Krepel et al., 
2013). A hybrid-spectrum MSR core was evaluated (Krepel et al., 2014a), 
the simplified reprocessing scheme assessed (Krepel et al., 2014b), and the 
continuous and batch-wise reprocessing schemes compared in (Krepel 
et al., 2015).
The chloride salts profit from the absence of broad scattering resonances 
and from the higher weight of 37Cl nuclide (Krepel and Kramer, 2021). 
Accordingly, chloride salts have generally harder spectrum than fluoride 
salts. The highest reactivity excess and therefore the best performance in 
both fuel cycles were provided by Na37Cl carrier salt. Its tremendous reac­
tivity excess in the U-Pu cycle can even enable the use of a breed-and- 
burn fuel strategy (Hombourger et al., 2015b, 2017, Hombourger, 2018, 
2019). Nonetheless, the absence of scattering cross section, which enables 
this huge reactivity excess on infinite lattice, results also in transparency of 
the salt for neutrons. Despite the high kinf, chloride-salt-based reactors are 

116 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
often voluminous to minimize the neutron leakage. The core minimization 
is the major ongoing research with only preliminary results (Raffuzzi and 
Krepel, 2020).
16.4 Fuel behavior at nominal conditions
MSR fuel behavior under nominal and accidental conditions can be ana­
lyzed by the thermochemistry of molten salts. The variety of possible salt 
composition calls for a tool able to predict physical and thermodynamic 
properties of a wide range of mixtures. The PSI in-house open-source 
Gibbs Energy Minimization Software (GEMS) (Kulik et al., 2004—2016) 
thus may play a vital role (see Fig. 16.3). The PSI activities grouped in 
this area are financed via the EU projects ACSEPT, SACSESS, 
SAMOFAR, and SAMOSAFER and through an internal MSR project.
Of the utmost interest for safety evaluations are the physical properties 
pertaining to accidental conditions such as phase changes (freezing or boil­
ing). Moreover, the behavior of specific fission products such as 99Mo can 
be of interest for medical isotopes production. The GEMS code with the 
extended HERACLES database (Shcherbina et al., 2012) can be applied 
to model the abovementioned MSR thermodynamic properties. GEMS 
has a modular and flexible database and user interface built around an

efficient open-source GEMS3K numerical kernel code (Kulik et al., 
2013) for solving phase equilibria in complex non-ideal systems that can 
be coupled with transport- or multi-physics codes. It is developed at NES 
since the year 2000 under the lead of D.A. Kulik.
GEMS3K also contains a TSolMod code library (Wagner et al., 2012) 
with . 25 state-of-the-art mixing models for aqueous, gaseous, solid solu­
tions, and melts. This gives GEMS a broad applicability to various types 
of materials, for example, fused salts, if extended with the necessary data­
sets for phases and their components. The input thermodynamic functions 
and interaction parameters of mixing are kept in the database and consis­
tently extended, as required. The accomplished and planned tasks in this 
topical area are:
• 
Thermodynamic modeling of salt melts. Mo behavior in alkali chloride 
melt (LiCl-KCl) was studied based on its speciation in the selected 
melts and standard Gibbs energies of different species (Nichenko and 
Streit, 2015).
• 
Molecular Dynamics (MD) application to MSR chemistry. MD and 
DFT simulations will be used to provide novel data for improvement/ 
extension of a thermodynamic database of the key MSFR fuel systems 
including PuF3- and ThF4. Properties that will be simulated are, for 
instance, specific heat, melting behavior, and diffusion coefficients.
• 
GEMS modification for MSR applications, thermodynamic database 
HERACLES extension with relevant data and models of fused salts 
and their mixtures to enable the GEMS for efficient simulations of 
their thermodynamic properties and processes.
• 
Extension of GEMS by a GEMSPHAD module for generating and 
plotting phase diagrams; amendments of GEMS3K kernel for efficient 
coupling with OpenFOAM.
Optionally, the results obtained by the GEMS code can be employed 
for precipitation and vaporization simulation under accidental conditions 
with the in-house code Parallel SImulator of BOILing (PSI-BOIL) 
(Niceno et al., 2010). It can simulate the solidification process of single 
crystals, and assess the feasibility of vaporization or freezing methods in 
the purification of waste salts. Similar simulations have already been car­
ried out in (Badillo and Beckermann, 2006; Badillo, 2015), where a 
phase-field model was used to predict the morphology and concentration 
distribution around a growing crystal.
The information on excess Gibbs energy for binary systems together 
with the information on thermophysical properties of pure compounds 

118 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
can be used to study complex systems. Such an approach allows to study 
the speciation in selected melts and to determine the standard Gibbs ener­
gies of various species in melts. The information on standard Gibbs ener­
gies is used to assess the standard chemical potentials of different species 
melts, as well as for constructing the E-pO2- stability diagrams, such as 
those developed for Mo in LiCl-KCl (Fig. 16.4, Nichenko and Streit, 
2015). Among the stable Mo species in LiCl-KCl system are in this case: 
MoCl3, MoO2, and MoO3. Higher chlorides and oxychlorides are 
unstable and thus are not present in the melt. This information can sup­
port an experimental study on CERMET fuels electrochemical reproces­
sing in the presented melts.
At PSI also the Molecular Dynamic (MD) is used for modeling trans­
port properties such as heat conductivity and viscosity, as well as structural 
properties of solid and liquid phases. The goal is to complement experi­
mental research by providing data at the atomic level in the melt under a 
variety of variables, such as compositions and temperatures, including 
some that are difficult to achieve experimentally.
The so-called GreenKubo approach is used to calculate the dynamic 
properties of melt (viscosity and thermal conductivity), which allows for 
an accurate calculation of the dynamic properties at the temperature and 
composition of interest and is a reliable tool for studying the influence of 
small amounts of additives and FPs on the transport properties of the fuel 
salt. The major focus of the research is on the optimization of Force-Field 
model parameters for the chemicals of interest.
This kind of research is difficult to perform due to the limitations of 
the existing force field models. For example, available force field models

Fig. 16.6, one of the key components of the fluoride-based salt, was the 
driving reason for the invention of the novel Force-Field model. Fig. 16.5 
shows how the created model allows for precise modeling of both solid- 
and liquid-phase structural features.
Fig. 16.6 shows how well the created model can reflect experimentally 
measured viscosity values for the LiF-ThF4 system. The research con­
tinues in the direction of developing Force-Field databases for molten 
salts, actinides, and FPs, and using these data to calculate transport para­
meters such as viscosity and thermal conductivity.
16.5 Transient behavior and decay heat removal system
The activities are grouped in this topical area based on MSc and PhD stud­
ies. The development of two different approaches for MSR transient analy­
sis is considered, based on the coupled system code TRACE-PARCS

120 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
(Kim, 2015; Zanetti et al., 2015) and on the OpenFOAM high-fidelity 
solver GeN-Foam (Fiorina et al., 2015a,b, 2016). MSR thermal-hydraulics 
is peculiar from several points of view:
• 
The liquid fuel is acting at the same time as a coolant.
• 
The solid moderator, if used, is cooled by the liquid fuel.
• 
The delayed neutron precursors drift with the salt flow.
• 
The heat from fast-decaying fission products is spatially distributed in 
the salt.
• 
The heat from slower-decaying fission products is equally distributed 
in the salt volume.
• 
Since the salt is volumetrically heated, the bulk salt temperature has a 
different meaning for the heat exchange with solid walls than in the 
classical case.
These features make the simulation of MSRs a very interesting 
research topic. There were only few available codes that can simulate sev­
eral of these peculiarities. Especially, the heat exchange between volumet- 
rically heated liquids and solid surfaces is a scientifically challenging issue, 
which can have a strong relevance to safety. The accomplished tasks in 
this topical area are:
• 
Salt properties inclusion in the TRACE code and pre-evaluation of 
the heat exchangers (Ariu, 2014).
• 
TRACE-point kinetics modification for delayed neutron precursors 
drift (Zanetti et al., 2015).
• 
TRACE-PARCS modification for delay neutron precursors drift and 
its application to MSRE transients (Kim, 2015).
• 
Assessment of decay heat distribution in the fuel stream (Choe, 2015).
• 
Development of GeN-Foam solver for OpenFOAM field solver 
(Fiorina et al., 2015a,b, 2016) and GeN-Foam modification for 
delayed neutrons precursors drift.
• 
In the frame of the MSc thesis, the GeN-Foam solver was applied to 
MSRE (Bao, 2016).
• 
In the frame of SAMOFAR project, a PhD study was dedicated to 
extension of GeN-Foam by freezing model, which resulted in a code 
branch called ATARI (de Oliveira, 2021).
As an example of TRACE application, the response of the MSRE 
core at 8 MW power level to a unprotected pump trip (adopted from 
Kim, 2015) is shown in Fig. 16.7. The power decreases after the pump 
trips relatively steeply; the average salt and graphite temperatures at the 
end of the transient are only slightly increased. Furthermore, the power

stabilizes, due to the natural circulation on the 1 MW level. Another illus­
trative result (Bao, 2015) shows in Fig. 16.8 a basic parametric study 
related to a cold jet-driven MSR. It was assumed that the cold salt in the 
center of the core can have stronger reactivity worth and thus that it can 
be used more efficiently to control the power. Four different locations for 
the salt outlet have been evaluated from the maximal temperature point 
of view. Generally, it was concluded that the impact of spatial tempera­
ture distribution on the reactivity is low and does not provide strong 
advantages.
16.6 Safety, fuel stream, and relevant limits
The evaluation of MSR safety is the main long-term aim of the PSI 
research. It is a very broad topic, and the other three research areas should 
thus provide key inputs to support it. Since MSR safety strongly depends 
on the fuel treatment, the design and safety evaluation of the off gas sys­
tem and reprocessing unit may belong here. MSR safety is also strongly 
design-dependent, and only few general studies can be accomplished 
without the knowledge of the detailed design.

122 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
One of these tasks can be aerosols formation and migration in the con­
tainment atmosphere during severe accidents. Fission products may be 
present there, either in the gas phase or as aerosols. They undergo trans­
formations depending on the concentration of the different species as well 
as the containment temperature and pressure. The formation of aerosols 
from the gas phase species is simulated taking into account the formation 
by homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation and growth by condensa­
tion, coagulation, and agglomeration (Bosshard et al., 2013). Transport of 
aerosols and their deposition on the walls and other structures are simu­
lated based on the containment thermal-hydraulic conditions. As a result, 
the source term in the containment can be preliminarily assessed.
The cGEMS (coupled GEMS) code (Kalilainen et al., 2020; Nichenko, 
2020), created at PSI, connects MELCOR and GEMS to improve the 
chemical modeling in MELCOR under severe accident conditions. 
cGEMS acts as an interface between GEMS and MELCOR, allowing it to 
call either MELCOR or GEMS depending on the scenario, and so has a 
controlling role in the simulation process. Coupled computer simulations 
were used to investigate the release of fission products and salt compounds 
from molten salt reactor fuel under accident conditions. The GEMS was 
used to perform thermodynamic modeling of the salt and fission product 
mixture, and the resulting compound vapor pressures were exchanged with 
the severe accident code MELCOR, which simulated evaporation from a 
salt surface at the bottom of a confinement building. The simulations used 
LiF-ThF4-UF4 as the fuel salt, with fission products Cs and I. The composi­
tion of the fuel salt material was determined using the EQL0D procedure 
in conjunction with the Serpent 2 code to simulate the salt's equilibrium 
fuel cycle. When the salt was heated on the confinement floor, large 
amounts of salt materials and actinide species are released. The example 
of such a simulation is given in Fig. 16.9 (Kalilainen et al., 2020). 
Furthermore, the mixing processes in the salt influence the timing of the 
release of various chemicals. The depressurization increases the amount of 
evaporated materials by affecting the mass transfer coefficient at the salt sur­
face. One of the main conclusions is that the thermodynamic modeling of 
the salt mixture is critical in determining the dominant volatile species that 
must be considered when salt evaporation is investigated. This demonstrates 
that the simplistic evaporation modeling based on pure compound vapor 
pressures is insufficient, particularly for MSRs where chemical interactions 
in the liquid salt are crucial. Furthermore, the quantity of F in the salt 
combination has a significant impact on vapor-phase iodine speciation.

base case simulation (left y-axis). Salt temperature T is given on the right y-axis.
This might have a substantial impact on FP behavior during salt evaporation 
and should be researched more in the future.
Another example is the simplified level-1 Probabilistic Safety 
Assessment (PSA). It was applied to graphite-moderated FUJI-like MSR 
(Pyron, 2016) and identified main events for vessel damage. Since its 
safety architecture relies on emergency draining system, the vessel damage 
was always an outcome of a double failure. There were several initiators 
such as steam generator tube rupture, secondary pump trip, or loss of off­
site power. However, simultaneous failure of the draining system was 
required to cause the vessel damage. The only single failure, which may 
cause it, is the failure of the draining process itself (Fig. 16.10).
16.7 Summary
Switzerland and especially the NES and SCD divisions of PSI are involved 
in many research areas related to MSR. It participates in GIF and IAEA 
MSR activities, and it is a member of the SAMOSAFER project consor­
tium. The potential to combine exceptional safety with fuel cycle sustain­
ability is the key point and main long-term interest of the PSI MSR 
research. There are several rather timely competencies, and the research is 
driven by students’ work and international cooperation.

17.1 Goals
Nuclear studies were started in 1955 in Turkiye. The agreement between 
the Republic of Turkiye and the United States of America for the coop­
eration in the field of research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy was 
approved. The Turkish Atomic Energy Commission (TAEK) was estab­
lished in 1956, and a 1 MW swimming pool type of research reactor was 
established at Ku^uk Qekmece, Istanbul. Studies of uranium and thorium 
exploration and research in Turkiye are under the responsibility of 
Mineral Research and Exploration Institute (MTA), which was founded 
by M. Kemal Ataturk in 1935 (Erbay, 1985a). MTA has established a pilot 
plant beneficiation plant for the production of yellow cake and to educate 
qualified personnel in 1974 (Erbay, 1985b).
The exploration studies continued up to the end of 1990, and 9129 
tons of uranium reserve had been determined (MENR, 2016). The 
thorium resources have already been confirmed at about 380 thousand 
tons reasonably achievable and 500 thousand additional tons were esti­
mated, total 880 kton. Turkiye has about 21.4% of the world total. 
The first nuclear power plant of Turkiye, Akkuyu Nuclear Power 
Plant, is under construction, for which the investment cost is about 20 
billion dollars.

128 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
The goals of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) 
strategic plan for 2015 — 19 are to:
1. Deploy indigenous and renewable energy sources at maximum level
2. Support reduction of energy intensity
3. Use nuclear energy in electricity generation
4. Minimize waste and environmental impacts of the energy
5. Reach a competitive energy system strengthening the country’s strate­
gic position in international energy trade (MENR, 2016).
The coordinators for the Objective 4 are the Nuclear Energy Project 
Implementation Department (NEPUD) and General Directorate of Energy 
Affairs. The TAEK, Electricity Generation Company, Turkish Electricity 
Transmission Corporation, and Energy Market Regulatory Authority 
(EPDK) are the responsible bodies.
Performance Indicators of this objective are:
• 
Completion of electricity transmission lines for Akkuyu Nuclear 
Power Plant (NPP) by the end of 2018
• 
Start-up of Akkuyu NPP for electricity generation (test generation)
• 
Start-up of construction for Sinop NPP
• 
Determination of the field for third NPP in line with technical, eco­
nomic, and environmental criteria
• 
The initiation of pre-feasibility and investment preparations
• 
The completion of studies for the determination of investors
• 
Determination of domestic uranium and thorium resources
• 
Determination of the domestic nuclear industry policy based on these 
sources
• 
Preparation of a road map by the end of 2019.
The Objective 11 in Goal 2 is about domestic uranium and thorium 
resources that shall be explored and developed for fuel in nuclear power 
plants. Under the coordination of NEPUD, the General Directorate of 
Mining Affairs, General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration 
(MTA), and ETI Maden General Directorate (ETI MADEN) are the 
responsible bodies (MENR, 2016). The reserve determination studies of 
uranium and thorium resources and preparation of production feasibility 
studies will be completed by the end of 2019.
Investigations of Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium are reported in the lit­
erature by individual researchers at the universities in Turkiye. The interests of 
academicians have been directed toward the theoretical scientific studies. 
Generally, thorium as an additive fuel has been considered through neutronic 
calculations, and some systems as heat exchangers have been studied.

Turkiye 129
An extensive study carried by Energy Frontiers (ITMSF, 2016) with 
international contributions including L. Berrin Erbay, considers the 
Thorium Molten Salt Nuclear Energy Synergetic System [THORIMS- 
NES]. Furukawa et al. (1994; Erbay et al., 1994; Furukawa et al., 1995, 
2008, 2011, 2012; Furukawa and Erbay, 1997, 2010; Erbay, 1997, 2012a) 
described THORIMS-NES as a symbiotic system, which is based on the 
thorium-uranium-233 cycle; the energy is produced in molten salt reac­
tors, and fissile U-233 is produced by spallation in a breeder accommo­
dated in regional centers.
17.2 THORIMS-NES and Fuji
Thorium Molten Salt Nuclear Energy System (THORIMS-NES) is a 
radically different fuel cycle concept, which departs from current fuel 
cycles:
1. It uses a liquid fuel instead of solid fuel elements
2. It uses thorium instead of uranium as the fertile element to breed the 
fissile isotope U-233
3. It separates the nuclear power production from the nuclear fuel breed­
ing by proposing a simple thorium molten salt reactor (Th-MSR) 
devoted exclusively for energy generation by burning initially U-235 
or Pu-239 and eventually U-233
4. It proposes an Accelerator Molten Salt Breeder (AMSB) devoted 
exclusively to the production of fissile U-233
5. It will incorporate fuel reprocessing in Regional Centers.
It is a “Symbiotic” system with each function optimized by its simplic­
ity. The THORIMS-NES concept includes a planned timetable begin­
ning with the construction of the mini FUJI, a 10 MWe small power 
reactor, whose purpose is to recover the know-how that the Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory obtained in 1964—69 with the molten salt reactor 
experiment.
The rational thorium breeding fuel-cycle system named as 
THORIMS-NES (Thorium Molten—Salt Nuclear Energy Synergetics) 
can reduce the quantity of transuranium elements and for recycling fuels 
produced by all kinds of military, research, and industrial reactors. A sys­
tem for the realization of THORIMS-NES has been introduced by the 
explanation of relations between facilities. The status of groups working 
on Th and Th fuel cycle has been summarized. The development and 
launch of THORIMS-NES require the following three programs during 

130 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
the next three decades (K. Furukawa et al., 1994, 1995, 2008, 2011, 
2012; Erbay et al., 1994; Furukawa and Erbay, 1997, 2010; Erbay, 1997, 
2012a):
1. Pilot-plant: miniFUJI (7-10 MWe),
2. Small power reactor: FUJI-Pu (100—300 MWe),
3. Fissile producer: AMSB for globally deploying THORIMS-NES.
The replacement of the present fossil fuel industry by a fission industry 
needs to be achieved in the next 30—50 years. The fission industry should 
grow with 5—7 years doubling time. Such a growth rate will never be 
achieved by any kind of classical “Fission Breeding Power Station” con­
cept. Now a symbiotic system coupling fission with spallation (or D/T 
fusion, but not yet proven) should be considered, because fission is 
energy-rich but neutron-poor, and spallation is energy-poor but neutron­
rich (Furukawa et al., 2011). The new Fission—Spallation coupled energy 
technology should be sufficiently safe by eliminating a “severe accident.”
A new, more simplified, highly efficient, economical, and safe molten 
salt nuclear power station (MSR) named FUJI is presented, initially being 
constructed from the smaller reactor mini FUJI (Furukawa et al., 2008). 
The energy is produced in molten salt reactors (FUJI), and fissile U-233 is 
produced by spallation in Accelerator Molten Salt Breeders (AMSB). FUJI 
is size-flexible and can use all kinds of fissile materials achieving a nearly 
fuel self-sustaining condition without continuous chemical processing 
of fuel salt and without core-graphite replacement for the life of the 
reactor. The AMSB is based on a single-fluid molten salt target/blanket 
concept. Several AMSBs can be accommodated in regional centers for the 
production of fissile U-233, with batch chemical processing including 
radioactive waste management. FUJI reactor and the AMSB can also 
be used for the transmutation of long-lived radioactive elements in 
the wastes, and it has a high potential for producing hydrogen fuel 
in molten salt reactors (Furukawa et al., 2008). This system uses the 
multifunctional “single-phase molten-fluoride” circulation system for all 
operations. There are no difficulties relating to “radiation-damage,” 
“heat-removal,” and “chemical processing” owing to the simple “idealistic 
ionic liquid” character of the fuel.
17.3 Stirling engines
Power generation by the Stirling heat engine with Molten Salt Reactors 
has been proposed and examined by Erbay (1999). In the standard designs 

Turkiye 131
of MSRs, the classical steam cycle is considered for the heat removal sys­
tem. In her study, the steam turbine is replaced with Stirling heat engine. 
The hot molten-salt fuel transfers heat through a heat exchanger (HX), 
which constitutes the heater (hot-end head) of the Stirling engine. The 
flexibility in size of MSRs makes the use of a Stirling engine possible 
instead of the salt/steam cycle. The special properties of the small molten- 
salt nuclear reactors and the available designs for Stirling heat engines have 
been presented to yield the present capacities and the possibility of the 
MSR—Stirling combination has been discussed (Erbay, 1999). The 
MSR—Stirling proposed system yields a good match for power produc­
tion from the nuclear source and therefore gains higher public acceptance 
than other nuclear systems, with little maintenance.
The standard design of FUJI-series molten salt reactors is completed 
with the supercritical steam turbine for electric generation with the ther­
mal efficiency of around 45%. On the other hand, a Stirling (Str) engine 
works on the principle of closed operating chambers, necessities long life 
designs with minimum maintenance, and requires high temperatures for 
high efficiencies. When a small MSR is used as a continuous high- 
temperature heat source, the combined system turns out to be a prosper­
ous closed power-producing system. A dish Str engine having directly 
illuminated tube-type receiver has been considered in the figures in which 
the receiver is replaced with a HX (Erbay, 1999).
The figures of merit for the proposed MSR-Str combination are sum­
marized as follows (Erbay, 1999):
1. The pressure of the system is maintained as low as possible throughout the 
plant. In the standard design, the steam turbine pressure is around 30 MPa. 
To maximize the power, Stirling engines typically operate at pressure in 
the range of 5—20 MPa, which is lower than that of a standard steam 
cycle. The achievable temperature is higher in the proposed Str.
2. The system maintenance and operation are simple and practical, since 
the Stirling engine is a single closed unit.
3. The flexibility of the power size is ensured by using parallel Stirling 
engine sets in the proposed system.
4. The MSR-Str combination uses MSR benefits
• 
Reduced radiation damage in the liquid molten-salt fuel and blanket
• 
Physicochemical behaviors of molten salts have high predictability
• 
The configuration of the reactor is a simple tank
• 
The fuel handling is easy
• 
There is no core meltdown accident.

132 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
5. The system directly imports the advantages of Stirling engines, which 
are the most efficient heat engines, closed operating systems, operate 
quietly, and require little maintenance.
6. The proposed system constitutes an almost completely closed power 
unit, since the MSR has self-sustaining fuel characteristics without 
continuous fuel processing, and the Stirling engine is also a single unit 
having a closed cycle.
The MSR-Str combination merits further development for stationary 
electricity-generating plants. The plant thermal performance is limited by 
the molten-salt fuel outlet temperature. The required molten-salt fuel outlet 
temperature depends on the working fluid type of the Stirling heat engine. 
He gas is chosen as the working fluid. The thermal cycle can be considered 
as a single loop for initial designs, with the possibility of a two-loop cycle 
(Erbay, 1999). As the power level increases, the intense radioactivity of the 
fuel requires the use of a secondary loop. When the MSR-Str combined 
system has two loops, the primary loop exchanges heat with molten salt 
coolant flowing in the secondary loop. In the previous studies, the coolant 
salt in the secondary loop is NaF-NaBF4 (8—92 mol.%). When low power 
levels of Str heat engine designs are considered, a single loop is sufficient.
Since the power level of the MSR is dictated by the heat transfer rate 
and fuel is removed outside the reactor by circulation, the design of the 
hot-end head HX has a particular importance (Erbay, 1999). The heater 
should have a small volume in order to minimize the hold-up of fuel salt. 
Therefore, a counter flow compact U-tube arrangement is preferred 
(Erbay, 1999). A large heater head has been replaced by the proposed sys­
tem with a specialized compact HX. Helium, the working fluid of 
Stirling heat engine, flows inside the tubes of the heater HX and the mol­
ten salt fuel flows through the shell side due to the possibility of fission 
product deposition. Fouling of the tube walls by fission products should 
be examined seriously. The heater is designed to provide good drainage 
to avoid the accidentally freezing of the molten salt fuel.
The analysis of the alternative combinations for conceptual design of a 
power plant consisting of a Molten Salt Nuclear Reactor (MSR) and 
Stirling Engine has been discussed by Erbay (2001).
The system has the following problems to be studied in detail (Erbay, 
2001):
1. The oscillatory nature of the flow in the heater head effecting the 
flow of the liquid in the secondary loop;
2. Radioactivity of the fluid fuel flowing in the primary loop;

Turkiye 133
3. Heat exchanger sizing for preventing the hold-up problem;
4. Heater-head design as a heat exchanger for the flows of a molten salt 
(Flibe) and He gas working in the engine;
5. The present power limit of Stirling engines;
6. U-233 production as a fuel for the Molten Salt Nuclear Reactor.
17.4 Heat exchangers
The design of the heat exchanger offers solutions for FUJI-Thorium Molten 
Salt Reactor (Th-MSR) as a safe reactor (Erbay, 2012b). The design method­
ology already developed for normal fluids can be applicable to FUJI. For 
molten salts flowing in the mini-micro channels, the flow still can be consid­
ered as Newtonian; and Navier—Stokes equations can be applicable by con­
sidering the Knudsen number (Erbay, 2012a). The ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Codes and Standards of Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers 
Association (TEMA) are applicable to HXs. The compact arrangements can 
help reduce the fuel and salt inventory, but the problems of thermal expan­
sion may intensify (Erbay, 2012b). A careful vision is established by consider­
ing the decrease in the flexibility of mechanical design. The FUJI system 
pressure is lower than 0.5 MPa. The FUJI reactor vessel and all mechanical 
components in contact with the molten salts use Hastelloy N and graphite.
The fundamental design methods are summarized by Ka^ar and Erbay 
(2013). Thermodynamic analysis of a HX is presented in terms of irrever­
sibilities and entropy generation. The irreversibilities are important for the 
HX optimization (Yilmaz et al., 2013). The effect of internal temperature 
cross on the heat transfer and entropy generation is examined by tackling 
the 1—2 TEMA-J shell-and-tube HX (Yilmaz et al., 2013). The effect of 
the cold fluid inlet temperature on the thermal performance of two mini 
channel flat-tube with multi-louvered fin compact HXs has been studied 
experimentally by Dog an and Erbay (2016).
In general, studies carried by researchers have a purpose of thorium 
usage in a hybrid reactor or a symbiotic system, due to environmental 
concerns as well as to energy economics.
17.5 Fusion—fission hybrid reactors and nonproliferation
The potential of a moderated fusion—fission hybrid reactor fueled with 
ThC2 or ThF4 is investigated by Yapici et al. (2000) assuming a plant fac­
tor (PF) 75% under a first wall fusion neutron current load of 5 MW/m2.

134 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
LWR (Light Water Reactor) fuel rods containing ThC2 or ThF4 are 
placed in the fissile fuel zone of the hybrid reactor. The behavior of 
the neutronic is observed for 4 years. At the end of the operation period, 
the Cumulative Fissile Fuel Enrichment (CFFE) values varied between 
3.55 and 7% depending on the fuel and coolant type. Yapici et al. (2000) 
indicated that the best neutronic performance is obtained with FliBe, fol­
lowed by air and natural lithium coolants. After 48 months, the maximum 
CFFE value is 7% in the ThF4 fuel and FliBe coolant mode, and the low­
est CFFE value 3.55% is in the ThC2 fuel and natural lithium coolant 
mode. Consequently, these enrichments would be sufficient for LWRs, 
and the lowest radial neutron leakage out of the blanket is with the FLiBe 
coolant modes.
In a thorium fusion breeder, the production of denaturated fissile 
fuel by mixing the fertile fuel with natural-UO2 and LWR (light water 
reactors) spent nuclear fuel has been investigated by Sahin et al. (2001). 
Four different coolants (helium, Flibe, natural lithium, and Li17Pb83 
eutectic) are considered. In order to obtain a power flattening in the 
fissile-fertile zone, the UO2-fraction or the spent fuel fraction in the 
mixed oxide (MOX) fuel has been gradually increased in radial direction. 
Power plant operation periods between 13 and 29 months are evaluated. 
Sahin et al. (2001) concluded that the U-238 component of natural-UO2 
can provide a limited proliferation hardening only for the U-233 compo­
nent, whereas the homogenous mixture of ThO2 with a small quantity of 
( . 4%) LWR spent nuclear fuel remains non-proliferational for both ura­
nium and plutonium components.
Sahin et al. (2002) have performed a neutronic analysis for a thorium 
fusion breeder to burn minor actinides and to produce U-233, Pu-238, 
Am-242, and Cm-245 for spacecraft application. Natural lithium has been 
selected as the fuel zone coolant. Minor actinides from 5 and 10 units of 
LWRs per meter of blanket height have been mixed with ThO2. This 
has significant advantages with respect to plant operation and uniform 
usage of the nuclear fuel in the fissile zone. A neutronic analysis has been 
performed by Sahin et al. (2004) to assess a prospective usage of light 
water reactor (LWR) spent fuel in deuterium uranium reactors mixed 
with thoria (ThO2), hence to open the extended usage of worldwide dis­
posed spent nuclear fuel from CANDU reactors.
Yapici et al. (2005) have studied how to denature nuclear weapon 
grade plutonium in a thorium fusion breeder. Ten fuel rods containing 
the mixture of ThO2 and PuO2 are placed in the radial direction in the 

Turkiye 135
fissile zone where ThO2 is mixed with variable amounts of PuO2 to 
obtain a quasi-constant nuclear heat production density. The plutonium 
composition volume fractions in the fuel rods are gradually increased from 
0.1% to 1% by 0.1% increments. The fissile fuel zone is cooled with the 
four coolants with a volume fraction ratio of 1. Yapici et al. (2005) noted 
that the energy multiplication factor M changed between 2.1731 and 
6.6241 depending on coolant type during the operation period.
Some quantities of plutonium have been accumulated in the nuclear 
waste of civilian LWRs and CANDU reactors. Sahin et al. (2006) indi­
cated that reactor grade plutonium can be used as a booster fissile fuel 
material in the form of mixed ThO2/PuO2 fuel in a CANDU fuel bun­
dle, in order to assure reactor criticality. They investigate the prospects of 
exploiting the rich world thorium reserves in CANDU reactors. In the 
study, two different fuel compositions were selected for investigations: (1) 
96% thoria (ThO2) 1 4% PuO2 and (2) 91% ThO2 1 5% UO2 1 4% 
PuO2. The latter is used for the purpose of denaturing the new 233U fuel 
with U-238. They observed the behavior of the reactor criticality kN and 
the burn-up values of the reactor during full power operation for . B8 
years; The reactor starts with kN 5 B1.39 and decreases asymptotically to 
values of kN . 1.06, which is still tolerable and useable in a CANDU 
reactor; The reactor criticality kN remains nearly constant between the 
4th year and the 7th year of plant operation, and then, a slight increase is 
observed thereafter, along with a continuous depletion of the thorium 
fuel; After the 2nd year, the CANDU reactor begins to operate practically 
as a thorium burner. Very high burn-up can be achieved with the same 
fuel ( . 160,000 MW D/MT); The reactor criticality would be sufficient 
until a great fraction of the thorium fuel is burned up, provided that the 
fuel rods could be fabricated to withstand such high burn-up levels. Fuel 
fabrication costs and nuclear waste mass for final disposal per unit energy 
could be reduced drastically.
A new fusion reactor APEX uses a liquid wall between the fusion 
plasma and the solid first wall for either tritium breeding or energy 
transfer. This liquid wall also allows using high neutron wall loads and 
reduces the radiation damage at the first wall to get high performance 
for the reactor. High quality of fissile fuel U-233 production has been 
studied by Ubeyli and Yalpn (2008) to achieve additional improvement 
in APEX. This can be obtained by using salts containing fissionable iso­
topes as a liquid wall in fusion blankets with respect to energy multipli­
cation and fissile fuel breeding.

136 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
For a new reactor type, the so-called fixed-bed nuclear reactor 
(FBNR), Sahin et al. (2009) investigated prospective fuels including Th 
with respect to reactor criticality. The reactor criticality has lower values 
with uranium fuel, and there is increased production of minor actinides, 
reactor grade plutonium, and weapon grade plutonium, as expected.
A Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) was also considered for dif­
ferent fuels including thorium compounds. Acir and Askin (2012) have 
investigated the time evolution of criticality and burn-up grades of the 
PBMR for reactor grade plutonium and minor actinides in the spent fuel 
of LWRs mixed with thoria. First, the plutonium—thorium and minor 
actinides—thorium ratios were determined by using the initial kef value of 
the original uranium fuel design. Then the time-dependent neutronic 
behavior of the reactor grade plutonium and minor actinides and original 
fuels in a PBMR-400 reactor was calculated. The core lives for the origi­
nal, the reactor grade plutonium/thorium, and the minor actinide/tho- 
rium fuels were calculated by Acir and Askin (2012) at ~3.2, ~6.5, and 
B5.5 years, whereas, the corresponding burn-ups came out to be 99,000, 
B190,000, and B166,000 MWD/T, respectively, for an end of life keff 
set equal to 1.02.
Different types of nuclear fuels including thorium have been studied 
in a Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor (GTMHR). Sahin and Erol 
(2012) have considered two different types of nuclear fuels acquired from 
the reactor operations combined with thorium and also considered a 
GTMHR. Performances were compared with the uranium fuel designed 
for this reactor. Nuclear fuels are 50% ThO2—50% reactor grade PuO2 
and 10% ThO2—90% reactor grade PuO2 uranium (original) fuel. 
Operation time (i.e., the time passed until the keff value reached a level of 
1.02 for original fuel), MA, 50% ThO2-50%RGrPu, and 10% 
ThO2—90%RGrPu mixtures were found by Sahin and Erol (2012) as 
515, 565, 765, and 2315 days with burn-up values of 47.7, 71.94, 75.1, 
and 213.4 GWd/MTU, respectively.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied a Laser Inertial 
Confinement Fusion Fission Energy (LIFE) hybrid fusion—fission nuclear 
energy system to generate power and burn nuclear waste. Sahin et al. 
(2014) investigated the main parameters of a LIFE-driven thorium 
breeder. A blanket similar to the LIFE engine design is chosen in order to 
allow mutual feedback between the two geographically separated teams 
toward a more advanced and improved design with independent views. 
ThO2 has been suspended in the form of micro-size tristructural-isotropic 

Turkiye 137
(TRISO) particles in the lithium coolant for U-233 breeding. The blanket 
energy multiplication M increases with thorium volume fraction, namely 
as M 5 1.2206, 1.2322, 1.2426, 1.2536, 1.2636, 1.3112 for respective 
TRISO volume fractions due to the contribution of fission energy. Fissile 
fuel productions in the blanket are calculated as 17.23, 33.09, 48.66, 
64.21, 79.77, and 159.71 233U (kg/year), respectively by Sahin et al. 
(2014).
Accelerators can be used to produce fissile isotope U-233 from 
Thorium. Sahin et al. (2015) have analyzed the integral U-233 and 239Pu 
breeding rates, neutron multiplication ratio through (nxn)- and fission 
reactions, heat release, energy multiplication, and consequently, the 
energy gain factor in infinite-size thorium and uranium as breeder material 
in accelerator-driven systems (ADSs). The irradiation is supplied by a 1- 
GeV proton source. Fissile fuel material production is calculated as 53 
232Th(n,g) U-233, 80.24, and 90.65 238U(n,g) 239Pu atoms per incident 
proton, respectively. They noted that the neutron spectrum maximum is 
by B1 MeV, and lower-energy neutrons E , 1 MeV have major contri­
bution on fissile fuel material breeding ( . 97.5%), whereas their share on 
energy multiplication is negligible (0.2%) for thorium, depleted uranium.
17.6 Recent developments—Turkish MSR
In 2019 SAMOFAR—Safety Assessment of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor 
Project—which is funded under H2020-Euratom was completed and a 
Turkish private company named FIGES-Computer Simulation in Physics 
and Geometry AS took part as an observer. In this project, a contribution 
was made especially to the design of the primary heat exchanger for 
MSFR. TAEK was closed in 2020 with a decree. Instead, TENMAK, 
Turkiye Energy, Nuclear And Mining Research Institution was estab­
lished with the same decree. Under TENMAK, there are NUTEN- 
Nuclear Energy Institute, BOREN-National Bor Research Institute and 
NATEN-Rare Earths Research Institute which deal with nuclear issues. 
The attention of Ankara Chamber of Industry (ASO) was turned to MSR 
with the individual efforts of FIGES founder Tarik Ogut and nuclear 
department head Resat Uzmen. As a civil initiative Nurettin Ozdebir as 
the chairman (2007—22) of the board of ASO organized web meetings to 
attract the attention of Turkish industrialists and to inform about MSR. In 
2021 groups of experts who will work in person and who can provide 
consultancy have been formed, and research has started for the planning 

138 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
of the studies and the design of a Turkish MSR officially headed by 
TUBITAK. Studies on the MSR research reactor are the responsibility of 
NUTEN. The last achievement was the project named “Advanced 
Reactor Design Feasibility Survey Project: Preliminary Analysis Project on 
30MWth Molten Salt Reactor Feasibility” completed in March 2023. It 
was conducted by TUBITAK (MAM). The project was supported by the 
organization named Turkish Energy, Nuclear, and Mining Research 
Council (TENMAK).

18.1 Introduction and national programmes
The United Kingdom remains committed to delivering energy security and 
combatting climate change and believes that nuclear energy should play an 
important role in this. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero 
(DESNZ) provides dedicated leadership on these priorities and will be 
responsible for driving forward our ambitions, as set out in Powering up 
Britain, to boost deployment of civil nuclear up to 24 GW by 2050. The 
United Kingdom believes that Advanced Nuclear Technologies,1 including

142 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
molten salt reactors (MSRs), will play an important role alongside large-scale 
nuclear to support a secure, affordable, and decarbonized energy system. The 
government is committed to ensuring that the UK civil nuclear industry has 
the required skills to deliver on its existing decommissioning requirements 
together with supporting the proposed programme of new nuclear.
The government’s long-term ambition is to boost deployment of civil 
nuclear power to around 25% of our projected 2050 electricity demand. 
Subject to technology readiness, SMRs will form a key part of this nuclear 
project pipeline. To deliver this ambitious civil nuclear programme, the 
UK Government has launched Great British Nuclear (GBN), an arms- 
length body responsible for driving delivery of new nuclear projects. 
GBN is tasked with helping projects through every stage of the develop­
ment process and developing a resilient pipeline of new-build projects.
The United Kingdom is committed to international cooperation and 
collaboration in nuclear. The United Kingdom is working closely with 
the Nuclear Energy Agency, International Atomic Energy Agency, and 
others on the next generation of nuclear technologies, to promote the 
highest standards of nuclear safety, security, and safeguards. As a member 
of the OECD/NEA, the IAEA, and other multilateral organizations, the 
United Kingdom supports numerous programmes and participates in joint 
projects in the field of nuclear safety, security, waste management, emerg­
ing technologies, and more. International collaboration is also a funda­
mental part of the government’s policy to successfully realize the 
opportunities of Advanced Nuclear Technologies.
The National Nuclear User Facility (NNUF) project (http://www. 
nnuf.ac.uk) is a government investment in the UK’s nuclear future, pro­
viding state-of-the-art experimental facilities for research and development 
in nuclear science and technology. There are currently 30 facilities housed 
in 12 universities, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, the National 
Nuclear Laboratory (NNL), and Diamond Light Source, most of them 
available for external access to undertake work on nuclear materials. The 
Pyrochemical Research Laboratory (see Section 18.5, The University of 
Edinburgh) and the Molten Salts Nuclear Technology Laboratory 
(Universities of Edinburgh and Manchester, sections 18.5 and 18.6, 
respectively) are specifically designed to support molten salt studies, but 
the NNUF provides open access to a wide range of capabilities relevant 
to the development of MSRs.
Advanced Nuclear Technologies have an important role to play in the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. The 2020 Energy White Paper and 

United Kingdom 143
the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan established a d385 m Advanced 
Nuclear Fund (ANF) to support the development of both SMRs and 
Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs). The government’s published British 
Energy Security Strategy referenced ongoing work to accelerate develop­
ment of large-scale nuclear and advanced nuclear technologies, including 
SMRs and AMRs. The Advanced Nuclear Fund includes funding for an 
AMR Research, Development & Demonstration (RD&D) programme 
with the aim of enabling an AMR demonstration by the early 2030s, to 
understand the potential of the technology. The overarching aim of the 
AMR RD&D programme is to develop and demonstrate high-temperature 
gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) technology to reduce technical risk, develop 
UK-owned IP, and have the option for further commercial HTGRs.
RD&D into MSRs is outside of the scope of the AMR RD&D pro­
gramme. However, while the government has made a commitment to 
RD&D into HTGR, it remains open to the adoption of any AMR tech­
nology that will enable the United Kingdom to meet its 2050 commitment 
and long-term sustainable energy requirements. It is therefore essential that 
the United Kingdom retains sufficient skills and capabilities to support and 
assess non-HTGR technologies such as MSRs. With this in mind, the 
NNL, other national laboratories, UK universities, and private enterprise 
are carrying out a number of programmes of work supporting MSR devel­
opment; these are summarized below.
18.2 National Nuclear Laboratory and collaborative 
programmes
The United Kingdom started a programme on MSRs around 1970, 
inspired by the US MSRE programme. There was close contact with the 
US group, and opportunities to collaborate with France were explored. 
The programme culminated in an extraordinarily ambitious conceptual 
design for a reactor as follows:
• 
Pumped molten salt system operating without moderator in a fast 
spectrum;
• 
Uranium/plutonium/sodium chloride fuel system with uranium/ 
sodium chloride breeding blanket;
• 
Electrical power of 2500 MW;
• 
Output temperature from the core of 1050°C;
• 
Helium as secondary coolant linked to gas turbine systems for power 
generation.

144 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Substantial work was also carried out on the fuel cycle, materials 
requirements, and other aspects. The reports are available for inspection at 
the UK National Archives at Kew. The key report is AEEW R1059 
“Conceptual design and assessment of a helium cooled, 2500 MWe mol­
ten salt fast reactor with integrated gas turbine plant,” which is located in 
AB 35/72. Further useful documents are available in the National 
Archive.
The original programme was terminated about the same time as the 
US MSR programme and no further work on MSRs took place in the 
United Kingdom until Moltex Energy began development of reactors 
based on static molten salt fuels in 2013.
While government-funded work on MSRs ended in the mid-1970s, 
work on nuclear fuel reprocessing using molten salts did continue. In the 
1960s, there was an active programme on electrowinning of uranium from 
spent Magnox fuel. Through the 1970s and 1990s, small laboratory-scale 
projects were carried out at British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), generally in 
the context of larger European collaborations, and with a focus on the 
pyro-processing concepts developed at Argonne National Laboratory. In 
the early 2000s and prior to the UK withdrawal from active engagement 
within the Generation IV International Forum in 2006, the United 
Kingdom had a significant programme of research on molten salt electrore­
fining process technology that included engineering, fundamental science, 
and experimental infrastructure investment; key to this was a Molten Salts 
Dynamics Rig (MSDR) that is no longer operational (Banfield et al., 
2005). The MSDR was a one-of-a-kind pilot-scale test facility fitted with 
three pumping options and a lithium chloride—potassium chloride eutectic 
(LKE) salt inventory of approximately 120 kg.
Since 2006, the United Kingdom, through the NNL and University of 
Manchester, has maintained skills and expertise in molten salt—based recycling 
technology through collaborative European projects, such as ACSEPT, 
SACSESS, and ASGARD2 (Bourg et al., 2011, 2016). In 2011, a 4-year UK 
EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)-sponsored pro­
gramme commenced focusing on direct electrochemical reduction, electrore­
fining, and speciation and analysis: this REFINE programme was the largest

programme of molten salts work in the United Kingdom up to 2016, led 
by the University of Edinburgh with partners from the Universities of 
Manchester, Nottingham, Cambridge, and University College London and 
NNL (Fig. 18.1).
Between 2016 and 2019, UK activity in the MSR field was most sig­
nificant in the private sector through Moltex Energy Ltd, though a num­
ber of universities continued programmes in the area. NNL also began a 
collaboration with the University of Liverpool in 2015, cofunding a 
research chair in nuclear modeling with the RAE for a period of 3 years. 
This collaboration helped spawn the iMAGINE project, which is 
described in section 18.5. However, in 2019, as part of the d505 m 
Energy Innovation programme, the UK Government awarded NNL two 
elements of the Advanced Fuel Cycle programme (AFCP, d40 m): 
“Future Fuels” and “Nuclear Fuel Recycle and Waste Management.” As 
part of the latter programme, a project to reestablish skills in capability 
pyrochemical processing and treatment of resulting wastes was developed. 
NNL delivered this project by taking a collaborative approach, working 
with nine UK universities. The extensive programme is summarized in 
Fig. 18.2.
NNL coordinated and advised on all activities, but specific work on 
the following was carried out at universities:

AFCP has led to a rejuvenation in molten salt activity and a fresh look 
at MSRs by NNL. In 2021, NNL also conducted an assessment of the 
ability of MSRs to reduce the nuclear stockpile and has begun to actively 
engage with a number of reactor developers on how the laboratory can 
support their R&D needs. In 2022, The Molten Salt Technology 
Platform was launched, initially chaired by NNL, its purpose is to bring 
together stakeholders in molten salt technologies for nuclear to provide an 
authoritative body of knowledge, promote the underpinned benefits of 
the technologies, and foster collaboration. NNL continues to support 
international development efforts in molten salt technologies and has an 
internal programme of work including molten salt fuel production, mol­
ten salt properties measurement and analysis, flowsheet evolution, model­
ing, treatment and waste form development, and electrochemical 
experiments. The capability for the latter is expected to be significantly 
enhanced following commissioning of the Pyrochemical Alpha-active 
Processing Apparatus (PAPA) in NNL’s Central Laboratory.

More recently, NNL has begun to investigate molten salt—based elec­
trolyzers for hydrogen production. Projects are in their early stages but 
potentially will help close the gap between hydrogen and reactor technol­
ogies. While the applications of the technology are different, there is a 
good opportunity for cross-domain research into materials degradation.
18.3 Moltex Energy
Moltex Energy Ltd was established in 2016 to develop a globally patented 
concept of a MSR where the molten salt fuel is held in essentially con­
ventional fuel assemblies, with heat removed from the reactor core by a 
second molten salt.
This basic concept, the Stable Salt Reactor, achieves the major safety 
benefit of molten salt fuel, which is maintaining the most hazardous fission 
products in nonvolatile chemical forms (stable salts with high boiling 
points). The major benefit over other MSRs lies in the containment of 
the molten salt fuel in fuel pins, so it is not necessary to expose pumps, 
heat exchangers, valves, and other “plumbing” systems to the hot, 
extremely radioactive, and continually chemically evolving fuel salt. As 
such, the development hurdles are substantially lower than for other 
MSRs.
Moltex Energy established a subsidiary company, Moltex Energy 
Canada Inc, in 2017 and transferred intellectual property rights to the fast 
spectrum version of the Stable Salt Reactor to this company. That reactor 
is now being developed in Canada in cooperation with the provincial 
nuclear utility NB Power and with a strategic alliance with SNC-Lavalin. 
Major financial support has been received from the Canadian federal gov­
ernment. The company and the reactor design have successfully passed 
the first stage of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Vendor Design 
Review.
The fast spectrum reactor (the SSR-W), like all fast spectrum reactors, 
is effective at consuming the long-lived higher actinides that keep spent 
nuclear fuel hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years. The W in 
SSR-W stands for “Wasteburner” as that is its primary interest in Canada 
where the natural uranium-fueled CANDU reactors have generated large 
amounts of spent fuel requiring expensive disposal because of the low 
burnups inherent in natural uranium-fueled reactors.
Moltex Energy Ltd also transferred the intellectual property rights for 
its proprietary molten salt—based nuclear fuel recycling technology (Waste 

148 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
to Stable Salt) to Moltex Energy Canada Inc, and that technology is now 
under active development with successful experiments on highly radioac­
tive spent CANDU fuel already carried out in cooperation with Canadian 
Nuclear Laboratories.
While continuing to support its Canadian subsidiary, Moltex Energy 
Ltd also set out to develop a design for a thermal spectrum version of its 
Stable Salt Reactor. A second subsidiary was established in 2022, 
MoltexFLEX Ltd, to develop this technology, which has been named the 
FLEX reactor because of its almost unique suitability to operate as a flexi­
ble carbon-free energy source to complement the growing importance of 
intermittent renewable energy generation.
18.4 MoltexFLEX
The FLEX reactor is seen by Moltex as highly complementary to its 
SSR-W fast spectrum reactor. Its global target is all countries with a need 
for flexible, carbon-free, and LOW-COST energy. LOW-COST is capi­
talized as it is the most important target for MoltexFLEX. The company 
believes that climate change is a global problem and a cheaper alternative 
is required to fossil fuels. The price point that MoltexFLEX aims for is, 
therefore, the cost of power from unmitigated coal-fired power stations 
not burdened with carbon taxes.
The FLEX reactor achieves this by targeting utmost simplicity coupled 
with intrinsic safety. It is a SMR with thermal power output of 60 MW. 
The fuel is standard 5% enriched uranium converted to a eutectic sodium 
fluoride/uranium tetrafluoride/uranium trifluoride salt mixture. This takes 
place through a single-stage reaction of uranium hexafluoride from exist­
ing centrifuge cascades with metallic sodium. By eliminating the multiple 
steps of hydrolysis, reduction, pressing, sintering, and machining uranium 
oxide pellets, it is expected that costs of converting uranium hexafluoride 
to reactor fuel will be substantially reduced compared with conventional 
solid fuels.
The reactor is graphite moderated with single fuel tubes in channels in 
the graphite matrix. The core is cooled with a proprietary and globally 
patented coolant salt based on a eutectic mixture of aluminum fluoride 
and sodium fluoride—a superb coolant system never before considered 
for nuclear purposes with viscosity barely higher than that of water and 
volumetric heat capacity three times higher. This unique coolant salt is 
the key enabler of the use of only convective heat flow for extraction of 

United Kingdom 149
heat from the reactor. It is also compatible with the use of redox control 
of the salt to essentially prevent corrosion of steels by molten salts—an 
approach to corrosion control that Moltex has been a proponent of for 
many years. In the case of the AlF3-based coolant salt, this is achieved by 
dissolving low concentrations of aluminum metal in the salt. Tests at 
800°C for over 2 years without rigorous inerting have demonstrated suc­
cessful control of corrosion.
All movement of the fuel salt in the fuel tubes and coolant salt 
through the core and through the primary heat exchanger is by natural 
convection. There are literally no moving parts in the reactor. This avoid­
ance of moving parts enables the reactor to operate with a core output 
temperature of 800°C—temperatures normally associated with HTGRs.
The reactor also achieves reactivity control through passive means 
with patented “gadolinium thermometers,” which resemble old-fashioned 
mercury thermometers. As the bulbs of the thermometers heat up, molten 
gadolinium salt rises into the stems of the thermometers, which pass into 
the reactor core, absorbing neutrons and lowering core reactivity. This 
allows the reactor to passively and safely respond to changes in heat 
abstraction via the primary heat exchangers with no automated or human 
action required.
Like many small reactors, the FLEX reactor is continuously cooled by 
air flowing past the tank wall, so engineered emergency cooling systems 
are not required for safety in the event of a loss of power or cooling 
water. The low power and high temperature of the reactor enable the use 
of a double-tank arrangement where inner and outer tanks are separated 
by borated insulation to reduce the tank temperature well below tempera­
tures where corrosion by the circulating air would be a problem and also 
greatly reduce the amount of activated Ar-41 produced in the cooling air.
18.4.1 Cost structure of the FLEX reactor and power plant
The FLEX reactor is designed to operate using Moltex’s GridReserve 
technology, which allows grid-scale quantities of energy to be stored in 
large tanks of molten salt for periods of hours or days. This storage solu­
tion is particularly useful for the FLEX reactor due to the high output 
temperatures achieved. This allows low-cost chloride salts to be used as 
the storage medium instead of the more expensive, thermally unstable, 
and corrosive nitrate salts used in other heat storage solutions.

150 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
GridReserve allows the reactor to be coupled to a power plant 
with multiples of the reactor power. So a power plant could comprise 
300 MWe of reactor power coupled to 900 MWe of steam turbogen­
erators operating only the highest demand 8 hours of the day. This is 
the daily peaking mode of the reactor deployment, which is perfect for 
providing short-term (up to a week) response to grid demand. Such 
operation is becoming essential for nuclear to be economically compet­
itive—in any electricity market with high renewable penetration, there 
will be times when zero marginal cost renewables provide all the 
power needed.
Nuclear baseload generation as an economic model is a thing of the 
past. If significant amounts of inflexible baseload nuclear generation are 
added to a modern grid with high levels of wind and solar generation, 
those zero marginal cost renewables will have to be paid to turn off when 
renewable energy is plentiful, which makes no economic sense.
The capital cost of the FLEX reactor itself has been independently cal­
culated by two major international nuclear consultancies at well under 
$1500 per kWe capacity. Addition of 3 kWe of steam turbogenerator 
plant for every 1 kWe of reactor power allows the plant to run at triple 
the reactor power at 33% capacity factor to complement intermittent 
renewables. In this configuration, the capital cost of the power plant is 
around $1200 per kWe with the steam plant dominating the capital cost 
and hence greatly reducing the economic uncertainty inherent in costing 
advanced nuclear reactors.
The resulting levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is dependent on the 
discount rate used for the cost of capital, but at a realistic commercial dis­
count rate of 9%, the LCOE is calculated to be d28/MW/h when oper­
ated as baseload generation, rising to d42/MW/h when operated at a 
33% capacity factor. That is a substantially lower LCOE than can be 
achieved with unmitigated (no carbon capture) coal-fired generation.
The levelized cost of heat is even more exciting. Without a steam tur­
bogenerator plant, the reactor module outputs heat at about 800°C at an 
estimated cost of d8/MW/h. That is cheaper than a gas flame in the years 
before gas prices skyrocketed due to the war in Ukraine. This makes the 
FLEX reactor ideal for decarbonization of heavy industry. Where tem­
peratures above 800°C are needed, the temperature can be increased using 
direct electrical heating, so the “heavy lifting” is done by the direct use of 
heat at d8/MWhr, with electricity as a top-up at d28/MW/h.

United Kingdom 151
18.5 The University of Edinburgh
The Pyrochemical Research Laboratory (PRL) and the collocated Molten 
Salts Nuclear Technology Laboratory—Edinburgh (MSNTL) of the 
University of Edinburgh together form an open-access national user facil­
ity affiliated with the National Nuclear User Facilities (NNUF). The PRL 
was established in partnership with the UK Department of Energy and 
Climate Change in 2016 to provide academic, public, and private sector 
organizations with access to state-of-the-art equipment to support world 
leading research in molten salt pyrochemical processing and reprocessing. 
The MSNTL was opened in 2023 as part of the United Kingdom 
Research and Innovation-funded NNUF Phase 2 expansion.
The PRL is unique in the United Kingdom and provides the facilities 
to develop and demonstrate integrated pyrochemical processes for MSRs 
and nuclear fuel reprocessing at laboratory scale, using nonradioactive 
compositional mixtures, along with the required process monitoring. This 
helps to ensure rapid R&D progress by lowering barriers to entry and 
maintaining high throughput for facility users. The ready benchmarking 
of surrogate R&D work in radioactive-capable partner laboratories in the 
NNUF is facilitated by common infrastructure or capability alignment.
The laboratory consists of a suite of interconnected controlled atmo­
sphere argon gloveboxes equipped to demonstrate the essential elements 
of pyrochemical processing at the laboratory scale. This includes the capa­
bility for thermochemical and high-temperature electrochemical charac­
terization using potentiostats, thermal analysis using Thermogravimetric 
Analysis/Differential Scanning Calorimetry, optical and material analysis 
equipment. The PRL’s flexible configuration allows users to demonstrate 
either individual components of pyrochemical reprocessing or a complete 
pyrochemical process, including associated monitoring and analysis 
(Fig. 18.3). Work in the PRL has to date primarily focused on chloride 
salt mixtures, but there is developed expertise in studying oxide, hydrox­
ide, nitrate, and carbonate salts.
MSNTL Edinburgh is one of two complementary facilities with the 
second being MSNTL Manchester, see section 18.4, The University of 
Manchester. The MSNTL Edinburgh operates under the same environmental 
conditions as the PRL and has extended capability to enable the handling and 
testing of fluoride salts at the elevated temperatures critical for the R&D of 
MSR systems technologies along with extending PRL high-temperature 
rheometric analysis. MSNTL—Manchester offers equivalent low-throughput

experimental equipment and capabilities for radioactive materials. MSNTL 
therefore provides a vital contribution to the advancement of this reactor type 
in the United Kingdom through leveraging relevant expertise in spent nuclear 
fuel reprocessing.
Recent programmes include key roles in national and international 
consortia including those with universities and the UK NNL. Recent 
examples since 2020 are the successful delivery of two phases of the UK 
Advanced Fuel Cycle programme (AFCP), see Section 18.2 NNL and 
collaborative programmes, between 2020 and 2022, where Edinburgh led 
a consortium of nine other universities, and a Game Changers programme 
in collaboration with the UK Advanced Nuclear Skills and Innovation 
Campus. These joint activities have contributed to the development of 
UK flowsheets for pyrochemical reprocessing of nuclear waste, strategies 
for the electrochemical extraction of neutron poisons, for both fuel repro­
cessing and during operation of MSRs, online monitoring using electro­
chemical and optical techniques. They have also provided training of PhD 
and early career researchers to satisfy the increased capacity needs for the 
required highly trained nuclear scientists and engineers.
18.6 The University of Manchester
At the time of writing, a new suite of laboratories is nearing completion 
as part of the Dalton Institute within The University of Manchester. 
The laboratories provide bench, fumehood, and glovebox spaces to 

United Kingdom 153
enable study of both aqueous and molten salt—based separation activi­
ties. The laboratories can support work on materials containing uranium 
and small quantities of minor actinides. High-purity gloveboxes will 
soon be available for the study of both chloride and fluoride molten salts 
with latter forming part of the Molten Salts Nuclear Technology 
Laboratory (MSNTL) with the complementary facility at The University 
of Edinburgh, section 18.3. The University of Manchester also has a 
number of complementary laboratories making it an interdisciplinary 
hub for molten salts research with radioactive materials. As well as 
equipment for testing of chemical and electrochemical properties includ­
ing corrosion, The University of Manchester operates the irradiation 
facilities at the Dalton Cumbria Facility (DCF). DCF has X-ray and 
gamma sources plus ion beam lines. Experiments on molten salts, using 
bespoke apparatus, in these facilities are currently being planned.
The University of Manchester has an active laboratory training PhDs 
and early careers researchers. They are working on national and interna­
tional progammes and collaborating with MSR developers contributing to 
the development of UK flowsheets for pyrochemical reprocessing of 
nuclear waste, strategies for the electrochemical extraction of neutron poi­
sons, for both fuel reprocessing and during operation of MSRs, and online 
monitoring using electrochemical and optical techniques.
18.7 University of Liverpool
The University of Liverpool, with financial support from Science and 
Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the Royal Academy of 
Engineering (RAE), has developed a research programme for a reactor, 
iMAGINE. iMAGINE is designed to overcome traditional gaps between 
reactor operation and consideration of nuclear waste by considering the 
three steps: reactor, fuel cycle, and waste together with an ambition to 
achieve as near as possible a zero-waste nuclear energy solution (Merk 
et al., 2017, 2021, 2022). The aim of this work is not to find answers to 
the challenges identified, but to identify potential approaches and promis­
ing ways to go, as well as to stimulate a discussion among experts. Initially 
started as a cofunded programme by NNL and RAE, the project was in 
2021 awarded d2.5 m over 10 years through an RAE chair in emerging 
technologies. This corresponds to a significant investment from DESNZ 
into molten salt technologies.
iMAGINE eventually settled on a MSR technology as the most promis­
ing technology to close the generation, recycling, and partitioning

154 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
transmutation gap. Optimizing the reactor concept through the use of neu- 
tronics simulation and AI led to the selection of a MSR design with a fast 
spectrum to ensure sufficient breeding to allow operation on spent fuel 
only, without prior reprocessing. In turn this led to the choice of a 
chlorine-based molten salt, which allows an exceptionally high load of fer­
tile material to support the required breeding. STFC subsequently under­
took further R&D investigating the thermal hydraulics behind this concept. 
The Liverpool group has also contributed to the development of a number 
of early careers researchers, making a significant contribution to the skills 
gap in reactor physics and thermal hydraulics in the United Kingdom.
Due to the specifics of the MSR, it will be possible to operate on spent 
fuel from light water reactors without prior reprocessing since the salt 
cleanup system can be designed in a way to operate with the accompanying 
fission products. The use of an integrated salt clean-up process in which 
contaminants are removed rather than the fuel removes the requirement for 
cooling and dissolution of solid fuel and solid fuel production. Since there 
is no requirement for separation of fissile material, this also has advantages 
for nonproliferation and opens new opportunities in waste management 
including final disposal. Since the fissile and fertile materials stay in the reac­
tor and only the waste is removed, this will lead to a significant reduction 
in the volume of waste and reduced fuel demand.
The iMAGINE project continues to model and evaluate this inte­
grated fuel cycle approach though computational design and modeling 
but also through experimentation in collaboration with national and inter­
national universities and other institutions. The project’s vision is to move 
toward the establishment of a zero-power test facility, which is required 
to reduce uncertainties in the simulations and build confidence in the 
approach. It is noted that the high-level concept behind iMAGINE is 
similar to a number of other molten salt technologies, however, is cur­
rently different in its preferred technical solutions.
18.8 Science and Technology Facilities Council
Since mid-2017, Daresbury Laboratory has been collaborating with 
University of Liverpool in the coupled simulation of the fluid dynamics 
and neutronics of mobile-fueled MSRs. The systems simulated cover 
both chloride and fluoride eutectics. The fluoride eutectics were aimed at 
the simulation of the freezing of salt at the vessel wall of an optimized 
EVOL-type reactor where the fissile material comprised a mixture of 

United Kingdom 155
natural uranium and plutonium. The chloride eutectics simulations exam­
ined draining of the salt and the burnup of the fuel with an aim to deter­
mine the impact on the neutronics of the plating of noble metals that 
may occur in the reactors (Depositio-MSFR: A numerical study for the 
surface plating of noble metals in Molten Salt Fast Reactors). The chloride 
reactors were fueled by enriched uranium.
As part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy 
national programme on nuclear innovation, Frazer-Nash Consulting with 
contributions from Daresbury Laboratory produced one of six technical 
volumes on nuclear heat transfer (Macpherson and Cartland-Glover, 
2021) in terms of molten salt thermal hydraulics. The technical volume 
reviewed various aspects of numerical modeling including computational 
fluid dynamics, systems codes, thermal radiation as well as neutronics and 
fuel burnup in the context of MSRs. The technical volume also explored 
future developments in materials modeling using both density functional 
theory and molecular dynamics. Frazer-Nash Consulting also produced a 
case study of forced and natural circulation with the application of uncer­
tainty quantification.
18.9 University College London
The Electrochemical Innovation Lab at UCL hosts a range of electro­
chemical techniques supporting a wide range of industries allowing tech­
nology transfer between them. Within the last 5 years, there has been a 
vast array of pyroelectrochemical processing research conducted at the 
Electrochemical Innovation Lab, UCL. The bulk of this work concerns 
the use of molten salts within the low temperature range ( , 500°C).
The ability to manipulate the potential window of any given molten 
salt relies on having an awareness of predominance diagrams; predomi­
nance diagrams are used to illustrate extractive metallurgical processes 
important in the electrochemical processing methods needed for the mol­
ten salt cleanup processes associated with MSRs (Mirza et al., 2023). 
Recently, UCL has derived the predominance diagram for thorium spe­
cies using the LiCl-KCl eutectic system at 500°C (Fig. 18.4).
UCL has pioneered the use of fluidized cathode electroreduction and 
successfully applied this technique to challenging systems. The “fluidized 
cathode” process is a pioneering advancement of the Fray-Farthing-Chen 
Process (FFC), which is based on the principle of agitating the cathode 
precursor (a particulate solid) using an argon gas bubbling mechanism to

form a pseudo-mixture. It is versatile and offers several advantages: a large 
specific surface area, increased mass transfer and constant temperature dis­
tribution, and uniformity of mixing (Abdulaziz et al., 2017).
This technique utilizes a three-electrode system with a working (inert 
tungsten rod), counter (graphite rod), and reference electrodes (Ag/AgCl). 
Cyclic voltammetry, square wave voltammetry, and chronoamperometry 
are some of the most common transient electrochemical techniques used to 
understand the behavior of an electrochemical system. They provide the 
operator with key information into the reduction peaks and their associated 
currents as well as showcasing electrochemical noise features associated with 
the “fluidization” of the electrochemical reactor (Fig. 18.5).
18.10 University of Cambridge
Nuclear Energy Center at the University of Cambridge has been working on 
solid fuel, molten salt—cooled reactor designs for a number of years. As part 
of that effort, an AGRESR project (AGR Technologies for Enabling Salt- 
cooled Reactor Designs) has been recently concluded. The project was spon­
sored by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and 
was contributing to the US Department of Energy Nuclear University pro­
gramme project—Design of a Commercial-Scale, Fluoride-Salt-Cooled, 
High-Temperature Reactor with Novel Refueling and Decay Heat 
Removal Capabilities led by the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, in 
partnership with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and AREVA (now 
Framatome).

tem is illustrated without any electrodes and (B) highlights each electrode and the 
entry and exit point of the argon gas inlet into the molten salt system used to agi­
tate particles in the melt.
The appeal of solid fuel salt-cooled reactors is that the fuel design, 
manufacturing technology, and behavior under irradiation are largely 
known. Therefore, it arguably represents less of a technological risk than 
liquid fuel MSRs, while maintaining several key advantages of the latter 
such as low pressure but high-temperature operation.
The AGRESR project took one step further attempting to leverage the 
technology and experience of British Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors 
(AGR) in order to increase the technology readiness level of salt-cooled 
reactors even further (Forsberg et al., 2019). AGRs have many years of suc­
cessful operation in the United Kingdom. They operate at a temperature 
range broadly similar to that envisaged for salt-cooled reactors, they have a 
similar core structure composed of graphite blocks with coolant channels 
filled with fuel assemblies and have proven on-power refueling capability.
Within the AGRESR project, multiple coolant salt options have been 
investigated in combination with several fuel types and a broad range of 
fuel geometries. A number of constraints were imposed on core materials’ 
temperatures and reactivity coefficients to ensure operational stability, 
while aiming to maximize the core power density, as an indicator of the 

158 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
reactor capital cost, as well as maximizing the fuel burnup to initial 
enrichment ratio, as an indicator for the fuel cycle cost.
In the course of the project, it was found that several combinations of 
coolant salt and fuel type can achieve substantially higher core power den­
sity than conventional gas-cooled AGR by up to a factor of 5. It has been 
shown that within a reasonably large domain of the core design parameter 
space, the high-power density core configurations will have negative reac­
tivity feedback in response to thermal expansion of the salt coolant (Xing 
et al., 2022; Margulis and Shwageraus, 2020, 2021a,b).
Coolant salt alternatives to the reference LiF-BeF (FLiBe) salt that do not 
generate tritium during operation are less attractive with respect to their capa­
bility to increase the core power density and have a smaller design parameter 
space in which a negative coolant temperature coefficient can be assured.
One of the major findings from the review of past and contemporary 
studies of AGRs and other HTGRs is that permanent graphite core struc­
tures ultimately limit the life of the reactor, as these are typically nonre- 
placeable. This is a serious limitation of this reactor type, which nearly 
universally relies on graphite as the main neutron moderator. Consideration 
of a wider range of coolant salt options and core geometry configurations 
in this project suggests that operation of AGR-like salt-cooled reactors is 
possible without reliance on permanent graphite core structure. This is a 
major finding with far-reaching implications, potentially leading to develop­
ment of salt-cooled designs, which are no longer limited by the life of their 
graphite core structure. A follow-up work in this direction is ongoing to 
confirm and further explore this possibility. More detailed performance 
assessment of AGR-like pin-type fuel under low-pressure coolant condi­
tions is also ongoing in collaboration with Framatome and the Institute for 
Transuranium Elements (ITU) in Karlsruhe, Germany. An experimental 
campaign to establish the validation domain for such fuel performance 
modeling is also being planned in collaboration with the UK NNL as part 
of the UK participation in Jules Horowitz Reactor project under construc­
tion in France.

in molten salt reactors
18.11.1 Core Power
Core Power is working on connecting the nuclear industry with the

technology. However, they are fostering the crossbreeding of nuclear and 
marine regulations (IAEA and International Maritime Organization, 
IMO), by engaging in studies on nuclear marine applications (e.g., pro­
duction of green hydrogen with power produced by a floating nuclear 
power plant) and by producing concept designs of marine nuclear assets.
While not developing the reactors themselves, Core Power recognizes 
the potential of MSRs and is a participant in the Molten Chloride 
Reactor Experiment (MCRE) led by Southern Company.
18.11.2 UK Atomics
Copenhagen Atomics has launched a UK-based business to support their 
entry into the UK market. Their ambition is to have a criticality test in 
the United Kingdom by 2025 and a test reactor by 2028.
UK Atomics has initiated discussions with UK suppliers for determin­
ing the detailed programme of the criticality test including site location, 
decommissioning planning, and costs for full criticality test operations. 
UK Atomics is also working with University of Liverpool on material 
analysis and corrosion validation, which recently completed. A collabora­
tion on dynamic salt flow loops is developed with The University of 
Leeds whereby UK Atomics is providing the equipment for testing 
(Dynamic salt flow loop). A joint research programme is being carried out 
between Copenhagen Atomics and University of Edinburgh on salt char­
acteristics and corrosion behavior.

19.1 Introduction
From the USSR, Ukraine has inherited a huge amount of nuclear weap­
ons, the ruined 4th unit of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and 16 
PWR units that provide a half of the electricity power in the country. 
While the nuclear weapons were transferred abroad under the guarantee 
of security, Chernobyl is in the process of becoming a nuclear waste stor­
age. The planned decommissioning of the majority of PWR units (mainly

of the generation II) is expected before 2030. Taking into account that 
many institutions and plants in Ukraine were involved in the nuclear pro­
jects of the USSR, that one-sixth of explored world uranium reserves and 
a lot of other raw materials for the nuclear construction materials belong 
to Ukraine, we are not an ordinary user of nuclear technologies. Ukraine 
has good prospects for nuclear industrial development as a partner in the 
world community. The explored uranium reserves would be sufficient to 
provide the PWR fuel for the next 150 years. Therefore it was proposed 
(Paton et al., 2008) to develop a two-level nuclear engineering structure 
in Ukraine during the transition to Gen-IV. The PWR units constitute 
the first level. The second level is Heavy Water Reactors (HWR) with 
the fuel cycles oriented toward burning the spent nuclear fuel of PWRs 
and incinerating radiotoxic isotopes. Later, when MSR technologies are 
developed, they will be implemented in Ukraine. Since the MSR tech­
nologies are more promising but less advanced compared with the HWR 
technologies, they need a long-term R&D program, which currently is 
being formed in the world community.
Structural materials for MSR is one of the key problems of this pro­
gram. Since there are many institutions and experts working in this field 
in Ukraine, the project “Research and development of fuel and construc­
tion materials for accelerator-driven plutonium disposal and nuclear waste 
transmutation systems using molten salt fluoride blankets” was proposed 
by the researchers of the National Science Center Kharkiv Institute of 
Physics and Technology in partnership with the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory (USA). This project was approved for financing by 
the STCU in 2003.
As a rule, promising construction materials have to be tested in reac­
tors using special loops reproducing all conditions of real MSR. 
Experiments of this type take a lot of time and need special technique and 
testing procedures. The idea of the project was to imitate reactor condi­
tions of the material corrosion using the electron irradiation. The impor­
tant point is the relevance of the data obtained in the simulation 
experiments to the behavior of the material in reactor conditions. This 
problem needs special investigations, which were performed within the 
project framework. These investigations are based on the fact that the 
nature of kinetic processes induced, modified, and activated by irradiation 
is very similar on the microscopic level regardless of the type of irradia­
tion. For this reason, the investigation of the kinetic processes under elec­
tron irradiation gives valuable information, which can be used for 

Ukraine 163
prediction of materials behavior in reactors, using the proper rescaling of 
the kinetic coefficients.
A special remark concerning the corrosion kinetics in surface layers has 
to be made. The corrosion is controlled by chemical reactions. The reac­
tion rate is sensitive to the local energy deposition due to irradiation. The 
irradiation excites the electron states and can produce atomic replacements 
and displacements. These radiation-induced elementary processes need 
excitation energy from one to tens of eV per atom. Accelerated electrons 
and Y-quanta are ideal agents for activation of the corrosion kinetics at 
comparatively low rate of the replacements and displacements of atoms. 
Therefore an electron accelerator of proper energy (10 MeV per electron) 
was chosen to imitate the impact of the reactor irradiation on the corro­
sion kinetics. Concurrently, the electron irradiation impacts diffusion 
and phase transformations in the bulk and, especially, within the grain 
boundaries.
The corrosion tests in metallic melts and salts without irradiation pro­
vide a reference database and allow estimating thermodynamic driving 
forces controlling the corrosion and aging kinetics.
19.2 Methodology
19.2.1 Electron irradiation test facility
Some helpful features of the electron irradiation are:
1. Since the energetic thresholds of nuclear reactions induced by elec­
trons and Y- rays are nearly 10 MeV or somewhat less, the use of elec­
tron beams with the energy of 10 MeV avoids considerable 
radioactivity of the irradiated materials, so hot cells are not needed in 
post-irradiation investigations of the materials.
2. The penetration length of electrons with the energy of 10 MeV is of 
some centimeters. On this length scale, the electron energy decreases 
from 10 to 1 MeV or even less due to the bremsstrahlung and other 
inelastic processes. It means that, on the one hand, the test ampoules 
can have reasonable size to mimic large-scale experiments and, on the 
other hand, the irradiation conditions are dramatically changing on a 
comparatively small length. Therefore we can use many metallic speci­
mens of sub-millimeter thickness within one ampoule to investigate 
the dependence of corrosion and radiation damage processes versus 
energy deposited by e- and Y- fields.

164 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
3. The electron beam can be used as an efficient heater of the irradiated 
target to maintain the needed temperature if the electron beam power, 
target geometry, and construction are properly chosen.
The irradiation cell and general view of the EITF are represented in 
Figs. 19.1 and 19.2. The construction of the irradiated ampoule with 
tested specimens immersed into molten salt is also shown. The surface 
layers of the specimens S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 are indicated.
Surface layers of the specimens are marked by letters S1 .. . S6. Due 
to the gradual stopping of the electron beam, the deposited energy Ed 
(S1) in the first surface layer is much larger than that in the last layer, 
Ed(S6). Computer simulations (Materials for molten salt reactors, 2005) 
show that during a 700 hour experiment Ed (S1) 
6200 eV per atom,
while Ed (S6) 
120 eV per atom. In layers S2—S5, this quantity assumes

of the specimens, their surfaces are marked by symbols S1—S6. Due to stopping of 
electrons, the deposited energy within the surface layer considerably decreases with 
the layer number increase. In particular, the deposited in S1energy is 50 times larger 
than that in the layer S6.

intermediate values. Such ampoule construction allows one to investigate 
corrosion kinetics over a wide range of irradiation rates in just one irradia­
tion session.
19.2.2 Simulations of the e- and 7- fields and the deposited 
energy distribution
The electron and Y-radiation field magnitudes, the spatial profiles of 
energy deposition onto the molten salt and the samples, as well as the 
rates of point defect generation in the specimens have been evaluated by 
means of numerical simulations of radiation transport in the test bench 
geometry. The results of such simulations may be used to optimize the 
ampoule construction and provide quantitative predictions for the speci­
men properties vs. the irradiation dose.
19.2.3 Temperature distribution
Equation of heat balance that takes into account the total deposited 
energy and the radiation heat losses from the ampoule’s surface was used 
to estimate the thermal balance inside of the irradiated target. To calculate 
the temperature distribution within the ampoule, the spatial density of the 
deposited energy was used as an input and then the heat transport equa­
tion was solved. The calculations performed show that the temperature 
variance within the ampoules is really small.

166 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
19.2.4 Mechanical tests
The changes of the macroscopic mechanical properties due to the pres­
ence of the molten fluoride salts or metallic coolants were revealed by 
standard mechanical tests including nanoindentations. Indentation is an 
informative tool providing information about the changes of the mechani­
cal properties of the corroded surface layers of the irradiated specimens.
Additionally, investigations of the impact of the ultrasonic vibrations 
on the tested material were performed and provided information on the 
inner friction and materials’ sensitivity to the high-frequency fatigue.
19.2.5 Structural and compositional analysis
The compositional, structural, and phase changes were investigated by 
means of advanced diffraction and microscopy techniques that reveal 
structure, composition, and precipitation on the macroscopic, mesoscopic, 
and microscopic scales.
19.2.6 Corrosion tests
Corrosion of alloys and their constituents in a molten eutectic NaF- ZrF4 
fluoride mixture has been studied by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray analysis, 
scanning electron microscopy, and metallography. The corrosion rates of 
the samples exposed in salt at 650°C for different times were measured 
afterward in a fresh molten salt by the volt-ampere method. This way the 
impact of the electron irradiation on the corrosion rate of the alloys in 
molten fluorides has been measured.
19.2.7 X-ray spectroscopy
After irradiation by 10 MeV electrons, a small amount of nuclear reactions 
occurs, leading to the formation of Y-active nuclei. This gives a possibility 
to register the products of the alloys corrosion in the molten salt by per­
forming the Y-spectroscopy of the used salt. Although this method does 
not produce a proper quantitative compositional analysis, it gives a semi- 
quantitative and qualitative information about the solubility of alloy com­
ponents in the molten salt.
19.2.8 Theoretical models
Quantitative analysis of the experimental data calls for a development of 
appropriate theoretical models. The main goal is to describe the corrosion 

Ukraine 167
and phase transformation kinetics under the impact of electron irradiation. 
As far as I know, this problem is not yet solved.
19.2.9 Thermodynamics of Zr in alkali halide melts
Equilibrium constants determine the thermodynamic forces responsible 
for chemical reactions and dissolution of alloys. Since Zr and alkali metals 
are the basic elements of all fluoride salts used in MSR, it is important to 
know their thermodynamic characteristics. Investigations of the thermo­
dynamics of Zr in alkali melts were performed within the framework of 
this project.
19.3 Materials
19.3.1 Fluoride salt
The fluoride salt NaF- ZrF4 was used in the experiments.
19.3.2 Hastelloys
Ni-Mo alloys (Hastelloys), similar to those that had already shown satisfac­
tory corrosion resistance in contact with molten fluoride salts NaF -ZrF4 
and ZrF4-LiF-BeF at temperatures 600°C—800°C in earlier experiments, 
were prepared and used. Since comparatively small compositional changes 
of alloys can lead to a considerable decrease or increase of the corrosion 
resistance, two compositions of the Ni-Mo alloys (Alloy A and Alloy B) 
were chosen after some analysis of the corrosion data previously obtained 
by others. The nominal compositions of these alloys are shown in 
Table 19.1. It is noteworthy that yttrium was added in Alloy B to 
improve the grain boundary corrosion resistance. Compounds of high 
purity were used to exclude the impact of uncontrolled impurities.
19.3.3 Carbon-carbon composite
C—C composites with good mechanical properties and low chemical 
activity in contact with fluoride salts were chosen as materials for the 
ampoules. Tests of the corrosion resistance of these materials in molten 
salts under irradiation in EITF provided quantitative results on their corro­
sion properties.

19.4 Results
19.4.1 Results of the C-C composites tests
Tests show that exposure to the molten salt, with and without e-irradia- 
tion at 650°C, does not change the properties and composition of the 
tested specimens and ampoules. It looks like the test conditions were not 
“hard” enough to initiate a destruction of this material.
19.4.2 Impact of the NaF-ZrF4 molten salt and e-irradiation 
on the properties of the Alloys A and B
Our data show that:
• 
irradiation heavily impacts the corrosion rate;
• 
corrosion resistivity is rather sensitive to small compositional changes. 
Alloys A and B have minor compositional difference, but their corro­
sion resistivity with and without irradiation is considerably different. 
Besides, the corrosion rate of alloy B is more sensitive to the deposited 
energy Ed;
• 
impurities of La in the NaF-ZrF4 molten salt enhance the corrosion of 
the alloy A, even without irradiation.
The corrosion rates of the Alloy A and Alloy B vs. the exposure time 
and deposited energy Ed are given in Fig. 19.3.
As it is seen, the corrosion rate of Alloy B under irradiation increases 
B103 times, while in the case of the Alloy A, the energy deposition rate 
does not play such a big role.

Figure 19.3 The corrosion rates of the Alloy A and Alloy B vs. the exposure time and Ed.
In the Bremsstrahlung X-ray spectrum of electrons with energy of the 
order of 10 MeV, the comparatively soft Y-quanta with energy less than 
1 MeV are dominating. Therefore generation of point defects is weak 
even at high levels of deposited energy. Calculations show that at 
Ed 5 6200—120 eV/atom, atomic displacements range from b10 2 to 
1023 per atom (Materials for molten salt reactors, 2005).
The energy deposited in the fluoride salt is several times smaller than 
that in the Hastelloy specimens. Nevertheless, it is large enough to impact 
the chemical reaction rates. Apparently ionization and activation of atoms 
under irradiation within and near the surface layers of the alloy are the 
main cause of the acceleration of corrosion kinetics.
Different sensitivities of the Alloys A and B to the deposited energy 
rate show that the alloying additions (such as yttrium and niobium) have 
an essential impact the corrosion resistance. Therefore, the search for opti­
mal compositions of the Ni-based structural alloys has to be continued in 
varied environments and at a range of irradiation intensities.
Post-irradiation mechanical tests of the samples prove their high 
strength and plasticity. Microanalysis reveals the Cr depletion and the Ti 
enrichment in the surface layers, as well as penetration of zirconium and 
sodium into the samples. The thickness of the layers with considerable 
changes in composition is about 40pm.
Our tests have demonstrated that corrosion resistance of both alloys is 
acceptable, but Alloy B shows better properties.

19.5 Summary
At least one hundred experts from a number of labs in Ukraine and 
abroad were involved in the EITF tests of the materials for MSR, investi­
gations of their properties before and after irradiation, and attempts to 
design better material compositions. Results of their efforts are published 
in Refs (Bakai, 2008; Materials for molten salt reactors, 2005; Paton et al., 
2008; Volkov et al., 2006; Wanderka et al., 2007) and other papers. At 
the time this work was stopped due to the lack of funds caused by a com­
paratively slow progress in the development of the overall MSR program. 
However, the methodology of the MSR structural materials assessment 
developed in the KIPT-EITF project proved to be remarkably efficient. It 
is fast, cheap in comparison with the traditional in-pile tests, and surely 
deserves further development and use in combination with other 
approaches in the R&D of MSR structural materials.

172 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
20.1 Introduction
The influx of Molten Salt Reactor and Thorium Energy Alliance sponsored 
research within the United States has grown considerably since publication of 
the first edition of this book. Advanced research has taken place in National 
Laboratories, Universities, and by multiple for private reactor designers and 
stakeholders. The bulk of this research is building upon and adding to the 
knowledge base laid forth during the preceding decade. The general MSR 
and Th innovation has been spurred on by general acceptance that advanced 
nuclear and associated critical materials will play an increasingly large role in 
electricity and process heat generation as the global energy community devel­
ops reduced carbon technologies. As legacy technologies (coal, oil, natural 
gas) are replaced, reliable and clean base-load power technologies will need 
to be used in large scale to provide for the growing demand.
20.2 Oak Ridge National Laboratory
ORNL uses cutting-edge experimental capabilities and expertise to 
address critical issues in the development of advanced energy systems. The 
group leverages ORNL’s capabilities in advanced modeling and simula­
tion tools, next-generation manufacturing techniques, and the latest 
instrumentation and controls.
“We developed the loop with maximum flexibility in mind, so we 
could test numerous materials and components for possible deployment,” 
Kevin Robb said. “As we learned more about the concentrated solar power 
(CSP) program, it was obvious we could leverage that experience to do the 
same thing for them.”
Robb and Gen3 CSP project collaborators from the University of 
Utah, Virginia Tech, and Argonne National Laboratory will develop the 
solar-based loop, with salts and parts different from those found in the 
Liquid Salt Test Loop.
The team will design the facility to circulate heated chloride salts 
throughout the system. The goal is to offer extreme versatility via inter­
changeability of parts—from seals and pumps to valves and heat exchan- 
gers—providing researchers a variety of options to determine what works 
best in the loop, while avoiding pitfalls that could shorten the lifespan of a 
full-scale CSP plant. In commercial CSP plants, the hot chloride salts 
could be readily stored in tanks to generate fully dispatchable electricity at 
any time of day or night.

United States 173
“Our research at the liquid salt facility focuses on maintaining low cor­
rosion rates throughout the system,” Robb said. “We’ll analyze how dif­
ferent parts interact with the salt, and we’ll test corrosion mitigation 
tactics to simulate how this could work in a CSP plant.”
“ORNL is synonymous with MSRs because of the Molten Salt 
Reactor Experiment and the massive amount of research before and 
after that project,” he said. “When interest in MSR technologies from the 
nuclear industry resurged, we were ready to lead the charge. Now we’re 
seeing synergies in the technology needed for MSR facilities for reactor 
applications and Gen3 CSP and we’re ready to answer this call and take 
on a new challenge.”
20.2.1 Molten salt reactor workshop
The 2021 Molten Salt Reactor Workshop was held virtually on October 
12—13, 2021 from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. There was a tremen­
dous response to the workshop this year, and approximately 700 people reg­
istered for the event. 2021 marked the sixth annual MSR Workshop, chaired 
by David Holcomb since its inception.

Argonne will work with Terrestrial Energy to determine the thermophy­
sical properties of molten salts, which the company plans to use in its 
Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR). The IMSR uses two molten salt 
streams—a fuel salt that contains the uranium and another salt to transfer 
heat from the reactor to the electricity generation system—in a design 
that will optimize uranium usage and energy production while reducing 
the generation of waste.
Argonne will also work with Oklo, Inc., to speed deployment of a 
comprehensive database of information about metallic nuclear fuel perfor­
mance. The historical data were generated during decades of Argonne’s 
development of sodium-cooled fast reactors, which use metallic fuels. 
Oklo will work with Argonne to make the information more approach­
able to small companies that might lack the resources to tackle the massive 
database.
The third project will pair Argonne with CompRex, a company that 
is developing a new type of compact heat exchanger for applications with 
high temperature and pressure, such as nuclear reactors. The heat exchan­
gers can be used for advanced electricity generation using supercritical car­
bon dioxide instead of steam, a field in which Argonne has extensive 
experience.

20.4 Idaho National Laboratory
Status of Metallic Structural Materials for Molten Salt Reactors (R. N. 
Wright and L. Sham).
Several configurations are being explored, including the use of fluoride 
salts either as the primary coolant of a reactor with solid fuel or with the 
fissile material dissolved in the salt. Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) with 
fluoride salt typically have a thermal neutron spectrum. There are also 
fast-spectrum reactors that could use chloride salts to transfer heat. As a 
result of operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the 1960s, a system with uranium 
fuel dissolved in a fluoride-salt medium is the most well-established tech­
nology. A nickel alloy with about 6%Cr and molybdenum as a solid 
solution-strengthening agent was developed and deployed for all structural 
applications in this reactor. The alloy was commercialized as Hastelloy N. 
During these experiments and in post-decommissioning characterization 
of material behavior, it was determined that the most significant challenges 
for structural materials are embrittlement, from helium introduced by 
transmutation of Ni, and corrosion and grain boundary embrittlement 
from the fission product tellurium. The MSRE had an outlet temperature 
of approximately 650°C. The mechanical properties of Hastelloy N are 
not sufficient to support long-term operation of an MSR above this tem­
perature. Qualification of a material for use in the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, “Rules for Construction of Nuclear 
Facility Components,” Division 5, “High Temperature Reactors,” will 
facilitate licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hastelloy N 
has not been qualified for use in nuclear construction, and significant 
additional characterization would be required for Code qualification. 
Given that this alloy is susceptible to He embrittlement and has limited 
high-temperature strength, it is not recommended that Code qualification 
be pursued. Instead, it is recommended that a systematic development 
program be initiated to develop new nickel alloys that contain a fine, 
stable dispersion of intermetallic particles to trap He at the interface 
between the matrix and particle and with increased solid solution 
strengthening from addition of refractory elements. Extensive screening of 
attractive alloy compositions for elevated temperature strength, micro­
structural stability, weldability, and resistance to He embrittlement (char­
acterized using ion implantation) will lead to an alloy down-selection for 
commercialization and Code qualification

Ab-initio molecular dynamics study on thermal property of 
NaCl—CaCl2 molten salt for high-temperature heat transfer and storage. 
Approach-to-equilibrium molecular dynamics method is used for ther­
mal conductivity.
The correlations between microstructures and thermophysical proper­
ties are studied.
The distances and interactions between ion pairs determine its 
properties.
NaCl—CaCl2 molten salt is considered as a promising high- 
temperature heat transfer and storage fluid for advanced nuclear power 
plants and concentrating solar power plants in the field of renewable 
energy usage. However, the comprehensive physical properties and 
their microscopic mechanisms for the molten NaCl—CaCl2 are not 
measured accurately due to the extreme measuring condition. In this 
work, the ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation is used to investigate 
its microstructures and thermophysical properties for entire operating 
temperatures. It reveals that ion clusters are formed in terms of three for 
face-sharing, two for edge-sharing, and one for corner-sharing Cl2 ions 
between the coordination shells of two neighboring cations. The coor­
dination numbers of Na1-Cl2 and Ca21-Cl2 ion pairs decrease from 
5.88 to 6.46 at 783K to 5.33 and 6.02 at 1173K, respectively. 
Meanwhile, the reliable and meaningful values of densities, ion self­
diffusion coefficients, viscosities, and thermal conductivities were evalu­
ated from 783 to 1173K. It suggests that the distances and interactions 
between ions pairs determine thermodynamic properties directly. The 
ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation is an effective way to obtain 
the essential data for the designs of heat transfer and thermal energy 
storage systems in practical applications.

Patricia Paviet, an expert of the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, has 
been named National Technical Director for the Molten Salt Reactor 
(MSR) Program by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear 
Energy (DOE-NE).
MSR technology is undergoing a revival from the 1950s to 1970s, as 
nuclear energy and the development of advanced reactors are increasingly 
considered to provide a carbon-free baseload source of electricity.

The interaction between hydrogen isotopes and graphite at tempera­
tures of 500°C—800°C and a few Pa partial pressure is of importance to 
the management of tritium produced in fission and fusion reactors. Data 
are compiled on uptake and desorption from nuclear graphite above 
500°C and up to tens of kPa partial pressures. The enthalpies of reaction 
at the different types of reactive carbon sites (RCS) are reviewed and then 
used to discuss how temperature and pressure extrapolations could be per­
formed in order to fill the gaps in available hydrogen uptake data. 
Chemisorption is the dominant pathway of hydrogen uptake at the condi­
tions of interest. The importance of Trap 2 for reversible hydrogen uptake 
is emphasized. Neutron irradiation and pre-oxidation of graphite impact 
the abundance of available RCS and the relative distribution between 
Trap 1 and Trap 2. Isotopic effects will impact differently the occupancy 
fraction of Trap 1 and Trap 2.

phenomenology, and we develop system-level and component-level 
modeling tools for salt coolants.
3. Tritium transport: we study tritium transport from molten salts into 
graphite, developing both experimental and modeling capability. We 
also study characterization of graphite matrix and nuclear graphite, 
which are used in FHRs and HTRs. The tools we use here are also 
more broadly applicable to transport, solubility, and reactions of other 
radioisotopes in the salt and the graphite.
4. Molten salt chemistry: we are developing electrochemistry and optical 
spectroscopy tools in molten fluoride systems to investigate tritium 
transport and reaction kinetics, salt—graphite interface interactions, iso­
tope transport, and chemical speciation and to characterize the chemi­
cal state of the molten salt coolants.

Fluoride Salt-cooled High-temperature Reactors (FHRs) are an attractive 
fourth-generation reactor concept. Like other fourth-generation concept 
designs, FHRs offer characteristics such as a high-temperature low-pres­
sure molten salt coolant allowing the reactor to be combined with a high- 
temperature high-efficiency power generation cycle such as an air­
Brayton or supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO2).
Like most Gen IV reactor concepts, there are a few problems that 
need to be addressed with the design before it can be licensed. One par­
ticular design is the Mark 1 pebble bed FHR, a design put out by the 
University of California Berkeley. Two problems that need to be 
addressed are due to characteristics of the choice of molten salt. The main 
choice is a mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride (flibe). This 
work attempts to analyze the heat transfer performance of a double-wall 
twisted tube heat exchanger, which could play a part in the solution to 
these problems.
Particularly, the focus of the work attempts to understand the perfor­
mance of a three-fluid, parallel stream heat exchanger with two thermal 
communications with an emphasis on understanding the effect the inter­
mediate fluid and it’s flow rate has on the overall effectiveness of the heat 
exchanger.

20.10 South Carolina University
Professor Ted Besmann is leading a project that will provide a Molten 
Salt Thermodynamic Database that will be used by a number of compa­
nies and regulators around the world endeavoring to develop molten salt 
reactors that would be safer, smaller, and more economical than the cur­
rent fleet of water-cooled reactors.
To do that, they need a database of thermodynamic values for the salts 
in order to accurately calculate factors such as melting point of the com­
plex salt as its composition changes in the reactor, or whether the salt will 
significantly corrode the reactor vessel and piping.
Molten salt reactors are attractive to utility companies, such as 
Dominion Energy, as they look to add or replace power sources. At one- 
third the size of traditional nuclear reactors, they are simpler and cheaper 
to build. As a region grows and the need for power increases, utilities can 
add power capability incrementally and risk less capital, ultimately benefit­
ing the consumer.
The team has completed the first version of the database containing 
values for 60 different compounds and will continue expanding it to 
include additional elements and compounds that are important.
20.11 University of Tennessee Knoxville (Ondrej Chvala)
Terry Price, Ondrej Chvala, and George Bereznai, have developed a 
dynamic model of xenon gas behavior in MSRs.
In a liquid fuel, xenon will be continuously removed from the liquid 
fuel through off-gassing, which can be aided by a sparging process, where 
the fuel is injected with an inert gas such as helium. While the fuel is 
recirculated from the reactor’s inner core, bubbles of xenon rise to the 
surface and escape into off-gassing system for capture and sequestration.
“We have created the first model that appears to be descriptive of vari­
ous transients in the 1960s Molten Salt Reactor Experiment with the sin­
gle parameter set,” said Chvala.
What separate xenon analysis in MSRs from xenon analysis in solid fuel 
reactors are the migrational processes. Xenon behavior is very complex 
because it takes many pathways, forms bubbles, and can migrate into graphite.
According to Price, there had been some prior work done back in the 
1960s and 1970s, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, but their success in 
fitting their model to the experimental data was very limited.

182 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
“The breakthrough came when we realized that the xenon stripper, 
due to foaming action in the pump bowl, wasn’t as efficient as we initially 
thought at removing xenon.”
While there requires still more study of the effect of these xenon gas 
bubbles, the model the team developed provides reasonably accurate 
account of the poison fraction of the xenon compared with the experi­
mental data.
The team believes that its model is the first one capable of fitting both 
start-up and shutdown xenon behavior of MSR experiments using a sin­
gle set of parameters, giving critical insight into their functionality.

advanced reactor applications. In the past two years, Lee focused on high- 
temperature experiments including molten-salt test loop design and 
construction and heat-pipe cooled microreactor experimental facility 
design. Lee has capabilities to develop diagnostics and operate various 
measurement techniques such as PIV and laser-induced fluorescence, 
pressure-sensitive paint (PSP), hot-wire anemometer (HWA), FO-DTS, 
and confocal laser displacement sensor (CLDS). Additionally, he has tech­
niques for PIV, LIF, PSP, and HWA that provide flexibility for various 
targets at extreme conditions. Lee’s thermal-hydraulics laboratory 
(THLAB) is currently establishing its research infrastructure, which is to 
include a high-speed infrared (IR) camera, an FO-DTS system, a CLDS,

Alliance supports basic research into reviving the use of thorium as a criti­
cal material in Alloys, medicines, super conductors, catalysts, and electron­
ics as well as use in solid and liquid-fueled reactors. TEA also works on 
policy matters such as the classification of molten salt reactor definition 
with ANS and has been organizing and disseminating educational curricu­
lum materials for high school levels through graduate level. The TEA has 
organized 11 International conferences with significant global attendance 
and has been a catalyst for getting many of the founders of the current 
businesses developing molten salt reactors together. Thorium Energy 
Alliance has partnered with corporations around the world to advise on 
how to incorporate thorium into their businesses. TEA has presented 
information on the use of thorium at scores of conferences around the 
world including AIST for nuclear steel and AEA for nuclear ammonia. 
Thorium Energy Alliance will continue to the promoter of thorium for 
use as a critical material as well as a fuel source for solid fuel reactors and

20.15 Terrestrial Energy USA Inc
Terrestrial Energy USA is developing clean, resilient, cost-competitive 
power plant technology that will forever change how the world produces 
energy. By using long-proven molten salt Generation IV nuclear fission 
technology in a commercially innovative small and modular power plant 

184 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
design, we’ve created a brand-new, emission-free, sustainable energy 
source that can scale rapidly to meet the world’s growing energy demands 
while avoiding greenhouse gas emissions.
20.15.1 Integral Molten Salt Reactor Design
The central challenge for all nuclear reactor designers is to facilitate heat dis­
sipation to achieve safety and operational objectives. Terrestrial Energy’s 
IMSR (Integral Molten Salt Reactor) design dissolves the nuclear fuel in 
the coolant, a molten salt, to create a liquid-fueled reactor system. This fun­
damentally different system has the ability to dissipate heat through the nat­
ural mechanism of convection, unachievable with a solid fuel reactor.
Technology Readiness: The IMSR is a uranium-fueled, graphite­
moderated, fluoride chemistry, thermal spectrum molten salt reactor sys­
tem. This was successfully demonstrated at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory during its MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment) program. 
It is hence a proven reactor technology. However, an industrial reactor 
must be simple and safe to maintain and operate and must have a high 
utility factor. These additional requirements have historically created tech­
nology challenges to the commercialization of a Molten Salt Reactor. 
The IMSR addresses these remaining technology challenges, including all 
the materials’ lifetimes challenges, in large part through the IMSR’s inno­
vative “integral” core architecture. Central to this is a replaceable reactor 
core, the “Core-unit,” which has a 7-year operating life. Today, there are 
no fundamental technical challenges that the IMSR must overcome. The 
IMSR project is on a track of largely ordinary nuclear engineering work 
to advance it through licensing and construction. With this profile of 
technology readiness, Terrestrial Energy expects to have the first IMSR 
commercial plant operational by the 2020s.
Terrestrial Energy Inc. was founded in 2013 and has operations in 
Canada and the United States. Its Design Center is in Oakville, Ontario, 
which is the center of the Canadian nuclear power industry.
20.16 ThorCon
ThorCon aims for an operating prototype, with modular construction. 
Several 550 MWt units would comprise a power station, and a 
1000 MWe Thorcon plant would comprise about 200 factory- or 
shipyard-build modules installed below grade (30 m down). All compo­
nents are deigned to be easily and frequently replaced. For instance, every 

United States 185
4 years, the entire primary loop would be changed out, returned to a cen­
tralized recycling facility, decontaminated, disassembled, inspected, and 
refurbished. Incipient problems would be rectified, and major upgrades 
could be introduced without significantly disrupting power generation. 
The company claims generation costs of 3—5 c/kWh depending on scale 
and is “targeting its first installations in forward-looking countries that 
support technology-neutral nuclear regulations and see the benefits of the 
license-by-test process.”
20.16.1 Safe
ThorCon is a simple molten salt reactor. Unlike all current reactors, the 
fuel is in liquid form. If the reactor overheats for whatever reason, 
ThorCon will automatically shut itself down, drain the fuel from the pri­
mary loop, and passively handle the decay heat. There is no need for any 
operator intervention. In fact, there is nothing the operators can do to 
prevent the drain and cooling. ThorCon is walkaway safe.
The ThorCon reactor is 30 m underground. ThorCon has four gas 
tight barriers between the fuel salt and the atmosphere. Three of these 
barriers are more than 25 m underground. Unlike nearly all current reac­
tors, ThorCon operates at near-ambient pressure. In the event of a pri­
mary loop rupture, there is no dispersal energy and no phase change. The 
spilled fuel merely flows to a drain tank where it is cooled. The most 
troublesome fission products, including strontium-90 and cesium-137, are 
chemically bound to the salt. They will end up in the drain tank as well.
20.16.2 No new technology
ThorCon requires no new technology. ThorCon is a straightforward 
scale-up of the successful Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). 
There is no technical reason why a full-scale 250 MWe prototype cannot 
be operating within 4 years. The intention is to subject this prototype to 
all the failures and problems that the designers claim the plant can handle. 
This is the commercial aircraft model, not the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission model. As soon as the prototype passes these tests, full-scale 
production can begin.
20.16.3 Rapidly deployable
The entire ThorCon plant including the building is manufactured in 
blocks on a shipyard-like assembly line. These 150—500 ton, fully

186 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
outfitted, pretested blocks are barged to the site. A 1 GWe ThorCon will 
require less than 200 blocks. Site work is limited to excavation and erect­
ing the blocks. This produces order of magnitude improvements in pro­
ductivity, quality control, and build time. ThorCon is much more than a 
power plant; it is a system for building power plants. A single large reactor 
yard can turn out 100 1 GWe ThorCon units per year.
20.16.4 Fixable
No complex repairs are attempted on site. Everything in the nuclear 
island except the building itself is replaceable with little or no interruption 
in power output. Rather than attempt to build components that last 40 or 
more years in an extremely harsh environment with nil maintenance, 
ThorCon is designed to have all key parts regularly replaced. Every 4 
years, the entire primary loop is changed out, returned to a centralized 
recycling facility, decontaminated, disassembled, inspected, and refur­
bished. Incipient problems are caught before they can turn into casualties. 
Major upgrades can be introduced without significantly disrupting power 
generation. Such renewable plants can operate indefinitely; but, if a 
ThorCon is decommissioned, the process is little more than pulling out 
but not replacing all the replaceable parts.
20.16.5 Cheaper than coal
ThorCon requires less resources than a coal plant. Assuming efficient, 
evidence-based regulation, ThorCon can produce reliable, carbon-free, 
electricity at between 3 and 5 cents/kWh depending on scale.

20.1 7 Southern Company, MCFR
Southern Company, a leading energy company in the United States, is 
partnering with a private company to develop a molten chloride fast reac­
tor (MCFR) that uses liquid salts as both a coolant and a fuel.
The U.S. Department of Energy already invested more than $45 mil­
lion in cost-shared funds for the project to further identify and test materi­
als used in the reactor.
The MCFR will be optimized to operate as a commercial reactor that 
can produce up to 1200 megawatts of electricity, with a lower-output 
demonstration reactor proving smaller-scale potential.

United States 187
The design uses liquid chloride salts as the coolant and fuel that flows 
through the reactor core—allowing the fission to directly heat the salts. 
The mixture is then circulated through a heat exchanger to a coolant 
chloride salt loop that can be used for process heat, thermal storage, or 
electricity generation.
Because the reactor operates at a high temperature, the process is more 
efficient at producing electricity than light water reactors. The reactor 
would also produce less waste and could even consume waste from other 
reactors.
20.17.1 MCFR benefits
MCFRs can enable the transition to a flexible, robust, and low-carbon 
energy system.
The MCFR has what the industry calls a “walk-away-safe” design that 
would shutdown the reactor without any need for electric pumps to pre­
vent fuel damage. If there is a loss of coolant flow, the fuel salt would 
expand through the reactor core to passively halt the process and naturally 
circulate to remove decay heat.
20.17.2 Other benefits include
No fuel assemblies to fabricate, replace or store
Online refueling for continuous operation to increase fuel usage and 
availability
Ability to use multiple fuels for operation including depleted and natu­
ral uranium, or even spent fuel
Enrichment only needed at startup
Ability to load follow and support other energy sources on the grid.
Southern Company Services in the USA is developing a molten chlo­
ride fast reactor (MCFR) with a private company, Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory (ORNL)—which hosts the work, the Electric Power 
Research Institute (EPRI) and Vanderbilt University. It is not certain that 
it is to be a single-fluid type. However, fuel is be a chloride salt (see sec­
tion above), and as a fast reactor it can burn U-238, actinides, and tho­
rium as well as used light water reactor fuel, requiring no enrichment 
apart from initial fuel load. In January 2016, the US DOE awarded a 
Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) grant to the proj­
ect, worth up to $40 million.

Southern Company will explore, develop, and demonstrate advanced 
nuclear reactor technologies through subsidiary Southern Company 
Services. The effort will be managed through a new public—private part­
nership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power

21.1 Introduction
Nuclear physics began in Venezuela with the Eisenhower program 
“Atoms for Peace” within which a nuclear research reactor RV 1 was 
contracted and built (1956—60) during the dictatorship of Gen. Marcos 
Perez Jimenez and the following transition to democratic government in 
1958. The. reactor was operated in the Instituto Venezolano de 
Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC) as a service facility for a mainly biology 
and medically oriented institute with no real interest or vocation for 
nuclear physics. However, the institute’s library was designated a reposi­
tory of US Atomic Energy Agency publications becoming a valuable 
source of information. However, after successive ups and downs in the 
policy toward nuclear physics by the institute’s directors, the reactor was 
finally shut down (1991) in a “reversible manner,” and the core fuel, 20% 
enriched uranium, was dismantled and returned to the United States. In 
spite of the closure of an important sector with the decommissioning of 
the Venezuela Research reactor RV 1, there has been renewed interest in 
accelerators for medical use and applications of nuclear techniques for 
industrial purposes. These activities were also reinforced by technical

cooperation agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
IAEA Vienna, Austria.
During the 1970s, the official interest in atomic energy was expressed 
by the creation of the “Consejo Nacional Nuclear” (CONAN), later con­
verted to “Consejo Nacional para Desarrollo de la Industria Nuclear” 
(CONADIN) and eventually to the present DEA or “Direccion de 
Energia Atomica.” This institution became the Venezuelan counterpart of 
the IAEA. It had plans for the introduction of atomic power in Venezuela 
by the mid-1990s. It carried out modest surveying activities in the search 
for uranium deposits in the country, which yielded no results. However, a 
large deposit, Cerro Impacto (Aarden et al., 1973) containing thorium, 
niobium, rare earths, and other elements was discovered placing the coun­
try in seventh place worldwide in thorium resources (World Nuclear 
Association, 2015). Nuclear power introduction plans were abandoned 
with the world’s nuclear power cooling after the Three Mile Island and 
Chernobyl accidents.
A revival of interest in nuclear power came with the election of Hugo 
Chavez as president in 1998. The new government engaged in deep 
reform of the political and economic system of the country including the 
initiative to launch a nuclear program for peaceful applications. Venezuela 
had signed the Tlatelolco agreement as a non-nuclear weapons state (UN 
Office for Disarmament's Affairs, 1967). It signed two agreements with 
Russia dealing with nuclear science and technology. The first October 15, 
2010 (Gaceta Oficial, 2009) was mainly a mutual collaboration agreement. 
The second (Gaceta Oficial, 2010) considered the purchase and installa­
tion of two nuclear reactors in the country: A research reactor to be used 
for medical, industrial, and scientific purposes and a nuclear power plant. 
The agreements included plans for the training of students in Russia to 
build the necessary manpower.
The tsunami in Japan and ensuing damage to the four Fukushima 
nuclear power reactors on March 11, 2011 (Fukushima Daiichi, 2016), as 
well as the following world mediatic campaign against nuclear power, 
determined a presidential declaration putting a stop to the plans for the 
Russian nuclear reactors. However, the personal training program contin­
ued in a modest way with a number of students completing their post­
graduate degrees in Russia. This student training program was still active 
in 2016.
Modest nuclear science activities are carried out at Venezuelan 
Universities and at IVIC as part of the physics departments. This is mainly 

Venezuela 191
concentrated at the Dosimetry laboratory at IVIC and at the Nuclear 
Physics Laboratory of the Universidad Simon BoHvar (USB). This labora­
tory, founded in 1979, has produced the majority of the research into the 
science, technology, and personal training in nuclear science in Venezuela 
(Laboratorio de F^sica Nuclear, 2016).
In 2009, Kazuo Furukawa and Takashi Kamei paid a one week visit to 
USB, during which they gave a course in thorium molten salt reactors (MSR) 
after a presentation at ANFM2009 meeting (Kamei et al., 2009). This visit 
marks the beginning of the interest in thorium MSR of the research group of 
the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Universidad Simon Bolivar. Some of 
the group research areas are related to neutron production by spallation, neu­
tron transport, and interactions in the core. In what follows, we present some 
of the background activities in the field of molten salts, we describe a 
radioisotope-excited subcritical liquid fuel assembly and a contribution to 
Accelerator-Driven MSR (AD MSR). A further contribution to AD MSR is 
included in Chapter 15 of “Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy”.
21.2 Background activities
Venezuela has a large experience in the industrial use of a molten salt. 
This is an experience that can contribute modestly to the use of molten 
salts in the nuclear field. The aluminum industry (Alcasa and Venalum) 
reduces alumina (Al2O3) to pure aluminum in Hall-Herauld cells that 
contain molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) at 950°C. Very large cells handling 
currents as high as 350,000 A have been developed (Club Ensayos, 2016). 
The need to streamline the analysis of cryolite in order to diagnose the 
state of operation of the aluminum production cells and to optimize the 
operation of the plant resulted in the design of an isotope-excited neutron 
activation procedure for the analysis of the fluoride molten salt (Greaves 
et al., 2005). This work resulted in a firsthand experience with handling 
high-temperature fluoride molten salts in Venezuela.
As mentioned previously, the invitation in 2009 to Kazuo Furukawa and 
Takashi Kamei to spend a week in USB resulted in a close collaboration 
with the Japanese MSR movement and the publication of review articles 
(Furukawa et al., 2011; Greaves et al., 2012). The capacity of the molten 
salt nuclear fuel to be processed for the removal of nuclear waste and gener­
ation of fissile (Delpech et al., 2011) as well as the processing of alumina 
mentioned suggested the idea of using molten salts for the reduction and 
production of elements from the refractory mineral Columbite-tantalite

192 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
(Niobium and Tantalum mineral) from Venezuelan deposits. The work car­
ried out in Orsay, France, by E. D. Greaves with developments in the labo­
ratory of Dr. Silvie Delpech (Delpech, 2013) involved three molten chloride 
systems: ZnCl2-NaCl, LiCl-KCl, and NaCl-CaCl2 and one fluoride system: 
FLiNaK, ternary eutectic alkaline metal fluoride salt mixture LiF-NaF-KF 
(46.5—11.5—42 mol.%) that has a melting point of 454°C and a boiling 
point of 1570°C. The work resulted in additional experience with the use 
of molten salts and an opportunity for fostering the idea of the thorium 
MSR (Greaves 2013a, 2013b).
21.3 Radioisotope-excited subcritical liquid fuel assembly
A subcritical liquid fuel reactor project is in progress, at USB. It has as 
purpose the acquisition of expertise in the operation of liquid fuel reac­
tors, the test of modeling results and training of students. The project con­
templates the simplest configuration possible to keep costs and 
development time at very low levels. Operation is at room temperature 
for which the reactor’s fuel: fertile and (eventually) fissile isotopes are dis­
solved in aqueous media such as uranyl nitrate and thorium nitrate solu­
tions. The facility is built around an existing radioisotope neutron 
irradiator developed as a cryolite (F6AlNa3) analyzer to serve the 
Venezuelan aluminum industry (Greaves et al., 2005) as shown in 
Fig. 21.1. The reactor contains a radioactive neutrons source consisting of 
a californium 252Cf source and an americium-beryllium 241Am-Be source
Figure 21.1 Schematic diagram of the subcritical liquid fuel assembly facility show­
ing the graphite moderator, surrounding shielding, and liquid fuel circulation.

Venezuela 193
located in the center of a lead container that serves the purpose of shield­
ing the high-intensity gamma radiation of the californium source at 1.173 
and 1.332 MeV. The fission neutrons produced by the 252Cf source are of 
high energy (on average 2 MeV) so that the source is surrounded by a 
graphite moderator. The whole assembly has a biological shield consisting 
of lithium-loaded high-density polyethylene as well as lithium-loaded par­
affin blocks. As shown in Fig. 21.1, there is an irradiation port, which 
transverses the graphite lengthwise where the liquid fuel reactor core is 
located. The core consists of a 3/16 inch polyethylene tube rolled around 
a graphite frame with a number of turns that is located in the center of 
the irradiation port. The core has an entrance and exit for the flow of the 
liquid fuel. The fuel solution is made to circulate in and out of the core 
by a peristaltic pump at a controlled flow that determines the fuel resi­
dence time in the core. Due to the limited thermal neutron flux produced 
by the radioactive sources, monitoring of reactions taking place is accom­
plished in-line by a detector, but mainly by off-line measurements of the 
radioactivity of the liquid fuel. For off-line, a measure before and after 
irradiation is done with a high-resolution very low-level gamma ray spec­
trometer fitted with solid-state detector (LEGE HPGe Camberra 
GL2020L) normally intended for environmental measurements. The facil­
ity is used for neutron activation experiments in the “Advance 
Laboratory” practicals of the physics undergraduate curricula at USB using 
nuclear electronics for energy spectra and lifetime measurements in the 
identification of nuclear isotopes. Open-source Monte Carlo software 
packages such as FLUKA (FLUKA Home, 2016) and GEANT4 
(GEANT4, 2016) are taught to advanced MSc and PhD candidates in 
nuclear technology projects. The modeling of the operation of the liquid 
fuel subcritical assembly constitutes a challenging proposal to train them in 
current nuclear energy tasks.
21.4 Accelerator-driven MSR (AD MSR) simulation
An AD MSR operates as a subcritical assembly, and the chain reaction is 
maintained by an external neutron source. This can be accomplished by 
different technologies, for example, with a radioisotopic neutron source 
(252Cf, Ra-Be, Am-Be, or others) as described above or by an 
accelerator-related source that generates neutrons by gamma ray or parti­
cle beam nuclear reactions (Kamei, 2014). Earlier proposals on spallation 
reaction target design have been considered for running nuclear reactors 

194 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
(Furukawa et al., 1991; Rubbia et al., 1995) which operate close to the 
critical value. Today’s important technological progress could be advanta­
geously used for this purpose.
As part of an extensive study, we considered the ongoing EURISOL 
project (2009) as a possible neutron source for an AD MSR device. 
Essentially it is an accelerator with a technologically advanced ion source 
producing a 1 GeV high-energy proton beam impinging on the AD 
MSR device. The system is considered with a power between 1 and 
10 MW depending of choice of the reactor, effective multiplication factor 
keff value (Bk 5 0.98), and desired output power. It is usual to use 
Ebeam $ 800 MeV, targeting on fuel in the reactor core. In our case, this 
is liquid fuel flowing in the reactor core. This is a target station where 
spallation neutrons are generated in large numbers, between 30 and 40 
neutrons per reaction, which in turn interact with the thorium-uranium 
fuel providing transmutation and fission. The fertile-fissile nuclei, located 
by design in a large tank lined with graphite, circulate at high temperature 
and relatively low speed in a closed loop from the core to the heat 
exchanger. The target station therefore hosts the spallation neutron source 
and fissile fuel including 235U-rich and 232Th molten salt mixture. The 
latter contain ThF4 dissolved in the molten salt (FLiBe) being the fertile 
fuel to produce fissile fuel 233U. The target area is a modification of that 
proposed for the EURISOL neutron source with the important modifica­
tion that the spallation reaction takes place directly in molten fuel salt. 
The geometry of the device is shown in Fig. 21.2.
Surrounding the target is a graphite moderator with cylindrical geom­
etry providing the thermal neutrons and at the same time a duct for fuel 
transport. Further from the target (not shown), the fuel flows in a 
graphite-lined vessel that by reflection improves the neutron economy. As 
a last radiation barrier, a concrete wall provides shielding and structural 
support for the whole assembly. All of these details have been included in 
a simulation using the FLUKA code (Battistoni et al., 2016). The compo­
sition of the molten salt and relevant technical details are given elsewhere 
(Bermudez et al., 2011).
Results of the modeling of the target station for a proton beam of 
1 GeV and a current of 1 mA indicate that a specific density of neutrons/ 
cm2/mA is attainable. An example is shown in Fig. 21.3.
The distribution of the power density in the core of the reactor fol­
lows approximately as expected the 3D-Bragg curve. Energy produced by 
fission in the molten salt has a strong heat gradient toward the surrounded

graphite reflector and structural concrete. The system is conceived for an 
operational power of 10 MW. The distribution of fissions in the fuel as a 
result of spallation neutrons and of fission neutrons indicates an asymmetry 
of the neutron fluence, power density, and fission density in the forward 

196 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
direction of the impinging proton beam. Fission density distribution is 
indicated in Fig. 21.4.
Predictions by FLUKA show spectra that depend on graphite modera­
tor, fuel, reflector, and concrete wall shape and mass. Specific spectra are 
obtained for the various zones. These have an important consequence on 
the reactor’s effective multiplication factor keff. In fact, the spallation- 
related neutron energy distribution departs strongly from the fission 
spectrum. This in turn will superimpose to the existing in-core neutron 
spectrum and influence the neutron economy. One of these results is 
shown in Fig. 21.5 in comparison with the fission spectra. It has been 
observed that, in the non-fission multiplication case, fast neutrons produce 
relatively large number of (n, xn) reactions due to the spallation spectra, 
which contain a large portion of fast neutrons in the high-energy region.
The EURISOL AD MSR is characterized by the energy gain G (i.e., 
energy produced / energy injected), which is expressed by the relation:
(Energy=fission) 3 (Nonumber of neutrons per protons absorbed)=(v(1 2 ks)Ebeam) 
In that v represents the number of neutrons released during fission or 
G 5 (0:18Noks)=(v(1 2 ks)Ebeam) 5 G0=((1=ks) 2 1)
For uranium GoB3 and since ks is very close to unity G 5 3/(1/ks)

21.5 General conclusions
The radioisotope-excited subcritical liquid fuel assembly described shows 
how a facility may be operated with very simple and economical means, 
without the need of highly radioactive materials, which require extensive 
and lengthy certification procedures. The facility allows the acquisition of 
the knowledge of important features of liquid fuel reactors. Furthermore, 
it offers at the same time technical knowledge and the necessary expertise 
in the use of powerful modeling programs that condense substantial 
nuclear physics and important data and on how these tools may be used 
for the design of the nucleonic aspects of molten salt reactors.
The work carried out in Monte Carlo modeling of the EURISOL 
type neutron source shows that it is indeed possible to use this technology 
for a high-energy proton accelerator-driven MSR. However, further 
work is needed in refinement in respect to the size, scaling, fissile concen­
tration, and the requirement of a more realistic geometry.

22.1 GIF organization
The beginning of GIF meetings was in January 2000 when the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) convened a group of senior governmental 
representatives from the original nine countries to begin discussions on 
international collaboration in the development of Generation IV nuclear 
energy systems (Fig. 22.1).
The GIF Policy Group also decided to form a group of high-level 
technical experts to explore areas of mutual interest and to make recom­
mendations on processes to collaborate with and evaluate research and 
development areas. This group of advanced technical experts has been 
operating since April 2000.
The founding document of the Generation IV International Forum 
(GIF), a framework for international cooperation in research and develop­
ment for the next generation of nuclear energy systems, is set out in the

in 2002, Euratom in 2003, the People’s Republic of China, and the 
Russian Federation in 2006 (Fig. 22.2). In 2002 A Technology Roadmap 
for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems was published (GIF-002-00).
22.2 MSR pSSC meetings
The GIF Policy Group has decided to create a System Steering 
Committee for MSR in Generation IV (MSR-SSC) in 2004 Policy 
Group meeting. France, USA, and Euratom have made an initiative to 
join the MSR-SSC, but their representatives have been proposed in 
February 2005.
In 2005, two initiative MSR meetings were held to discuss the 
selection of MSR concepts and the identification of generic or specific 
fields of interest that should be addressed in the frame of Gen IV.

Generation IV international forum 203
About the general organization and missions of MSR System Steering 
Committees (MSR SSC), the MSR SSC is in charge of the R&D plan 
and defines the splitting, if needed, into specific projects (e.g., design & 
safety, materials and components, system and balance of plant, fuel & 
fuel cycle). According to the experience from other systems in Gen IV 
(VHTR, SFR, GFR), 1 or 2 years appear a reasonable time span for 
the elaboration of the R&D plan. In a second step, project plans defin­
ing more precisely R&D tasks, costs/resources, deliverables, and sched­
ule should be prepared. Regarding meeting organization rules, MSR 
SC meetings are organized and attended by the official representative 
of each partner (Euratom, France, USA) who can invite other people 
as observers, according to the needs and objectives of the meeting.
The meeting for provisional System Steering Committees for MSR 
(MSR pSSC) assigned officially by GIF took place in Paris in February 
2006. It was initially called MSR SSC, but since no formal system agree­
ment was signed, it has been operated as MSR pSSC since the third 
meeting (GIF System Arrangements and Memoranda of Understanding). 
As of the end of 2023, MSR pSSC meetings as below listed in the 
table (Table 22.1).
MSR pSSC discussed about transition to MSR SSC, but following on 
decision from 52nd PG meeting, GIF MSR group will continue as a 
pSSC and will evaluate its technical situation in 2 years.
22.3 MSR pSSC members
In May 2004, GIF Policy Group (GIF PG) decided to create an MSR- 
SSC, and France, USA, and EURATOM, which centered on the Czech 
Republic and the Netherlands, expressed their interest in participating. 
Russia joined the MSR-SSC as an observer in 2006.
In 2009, discussions were held on the mode of cooperation on MSR 
R&D in GIF. The GIF PG took the decision to set up a Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) for both the MSR and LFR system. This 
MOU would provide a more flexible structure for R&D cooperation on 
that system in the GIF framework for the mid-term.
Euratom (JRC) and France (CEA) have signed an MOU, but Russia 
and the USA remain as observers in 2010. In 2012, Japan and China 
joined the MSR-pSSC as an observer. In 2013, Russia (ROSATOM) 
changed to the signatory from observer, and Switzerland (PSI) made a 
sign on MOU. Korea has been an observer since 2013. Since then, the

22.4 Outcomes from MSR pSSC
22.4.1 MSR R&D objectives and areas
The renewal and diversification of interests in molten salts led the MSR 
PSSC in 2008 to shift the R&D aims and objectives promoted in the 
original Generation IV Roadmap, issued in 2002, to include different 
applications for fuel and coolant salts. Following the GIF Experts Group 
recommendations, it has proposed six projects for liquid-fueled MSR: 
• materials and components;
• 
liquid salt chemistry and properties;
• 
fuel and fuel cycle;
• 
system design and operation;
• 
safety and safety system;
• 
system integration and assessment.
Since that time, within the GIF collaboration framework, an MOU 
between Australia, Canada, France, Euratom, the Russian Federation, 
Switzerland, and USA (with China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea as 
observers) is providing a flexible structure for R&D cooperation on 
MSR concepts.
The common objective of MSR projects in different GIF countries is 
to propose a conceptual design with the best system configuration— 
resulting from physical, chemical, and material studies—for the reactor 
core, the fuel salt processing unit, and wastes conditioning (Serp et al., 
2014). The mastering of MSR technically challenging technology requir­
ing concerted, long-term international R&D efforts, namely:
• 
additional studies of the salt physical, chemical, and thermodynamic 
properties,
• 
system design and safety analysis, including development of advanced 
neutronic and thermal hydraulic coupling models,
• 
development of advanced materials, including studies on their compat­
ibility with molten salts and behavior under high neutron fluxes at 
high temperature,
• 
mastering of corrosion and tritium release prevention technologies, 
based on proper molten salt redox control,

206 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
• 
development of efficient techniques of gaseous fission products extrac­
tion from the fuel salt by helium bubbling,
• 
fuel salt processing flowsheet, including redox control and actinide- 
lanthanide separation tests (reductive extraction, precipitation, electro 
winning),
• 
development of safety, safeguards, security and proliferation resistance 
approaches dedicated to liquid-fueled reactors.
These common objectives are based on system research plan (SRP) for 
GIF MSR R&D, which has been elaborating since beginning of pSSC. 
MSR SRP consists of three common R&D areas, Fuel and Coolant salt 
Chemistry, Materials and components, and System Integration.
The aim of the R&D project “Fuel & Coolant Salt Chemistry” is to 
identify and address the key aspects that must be taken into consideration 
to understand and predict the integral performance of the fuel and coolant 
salt under operating and off-normal conditions of the molten salt reactor. 
The outcomes of this project should significantly contribute to the overall 
safety assessment of the reactor.
The objective of the Materials and Components Project is to conduct 
collaborative research on and development of materials, components, and 
substructures for Molten Salt Reactor systems to reduce their time to 
deployment. Activities within this Project include: fabrication processes, 
assembling methods, and characterization of commonly specified reactor 
materials (chemical, mechanical and physical properties), reactor components, 
and reactor substructures together with assessment of environmental effects 
and their effects on system structural integrity and component lifetime.
The major aim of the system integration project is to provide support 
for the development of the most promising MSR concept. It is the proj­
ect where the knowledge from material and components project and 
from fuel and coolant salt properties project will be combined to provide 
each concept assessment.
22.4.2 Developing generic safety principles for MSR systems 
The objective this task force, initiated by the RSWG and the MSR 
pSSC, is to establish generic principles, common positions, and harmo­
nized terminology for the safety evaluation of MSR cycles. While recog­
nizing that risks potentially impacting safety are present throughout the 
whole facility, a stepwise approach will be followed focusing first on the 
reactor systems and extending the analysis to processing facilities and then 

Generation IV international forum 207
the whole fuel cycle. The MSR safety approach will rely as much as pos­
sible on generic physical and chemical phenomena and fundamental safety 
principles applicable to most MSR concepts under development. The 
identification of generic risks and accidents initiators will also be explored 
as well as specific considerations for main MSR families (e.g., fast, thermal, 
fluoride, chloride salts), if applicable. The outcomes of this work will be 
collected in one or several deliverables.
RSWG and MSR pSSC members will propose representatives to par­
ticipate in the GIF MSR Task-Force (MSTF) to work on the safety 
approach for MSR technologies, but this MSTF will be open to any 
experts from GIF members willing to contribute to the effort. The mem­
bers of the TF should be familiar with MSR systems and/or safety funda­
mentals and requirements.
During the first meeting, this TF will elect a Chairperson and agree on 
work plan, deliverables, and different milestones while taking into account 
the ongoing work at other relevant organizations (IAEA, Working Group 
on the Safety of Advanced Reactors [WGSAR]) to avoid duplication. 
The Chairperson will report on the progress of the different activities of 
this GIF Tf at every PG meeting. The members of the TF will meet as 
necessary to accomplish the work plan. Timely interactions with external 
key stakeholders (IAEA, WGSAR, regulators, vendors) will take place as 
necessary in order to gather the necessary information and to review the 
different deliverables. Questionnaires, workshops, and other specific events 
could be envisioned to collect additional targeted inputs and communicate 
on the different activities of the TF.
22.4.3 MSR proliferation resistance and physical protection 
white paper
The Evaluation Methodology Group developed a PR&PP methodology 
during the Generation IV Roadmap (DOE 2002), but the approach was 
limited in its depth. Although incomplete information available about the 
systems contributed uncertainty to evaluations for all goals, the PR&PP eval­
uation was particularly restricted because of the lack of accepted metrics or 
figures of merit that could provide a comprehensive representation of the 
PR or the robustness of nuclear facilities against security threats. As a result, 
the criteria and metrics used in the final screening evaluations provided only 
a high-level representation of system performance in this goal area.
The Generation IV Roadmap resulted in a recommendation to 
develop an improved evaluation methodology to assess NESs with respect 

208 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
to PR&PP and to perform PR&PP evaluations during the earliest phases 
of design. The PR&PP Working Group (PRPPWG) was convened by 
the Generation IV International Forum in December 2002 and developed 
a detailed methodology, which was issued in 2006 as Revision 5 of a 
series of draft reports that present the methodology (GIF PRPPWG, 
2006). Revision 5 was approved by the Generation IV International 
Forum (GIF) for public distribution as GIF report GIF/PRPPWG/2006/ 
005 and can be found at the web address:
http://www.gen-4.org/Technology/horizontal/PRPPEM.pdf.
After Revision 5 was issued, the Working Group performed a case study 
of an example sodium fast reactor (ESFR) to test the methodology against a 
full fuel cycle energy system in order to gain an understanding of the actual 
application of the approach and to identify areas in the methodology that 
could be improved (GIF PRPPWG, 2009). In addition, some members of 
the Working Group applied the Revision 5 methodology to other (than 
GIF) applications (Zentner et al., 2010) and were able to develop insights 
on how the PR&PP methodology could be further improved.
The Working Group identified two main areas in which the method­
ology could be updated and further elucidated. These are: (1) the expert 
elicitation process by which information from subject matter experts is 
incorporated in a PR&PP assessment and (2) the characterization of 
metrics that are used to define measurement scales for the high-level 
PR&PP evaluation measures.
The present document, termed Revision 6, updates Revision 5 in 
these two areas. These updates do not change the PR&PP methodology 
in any fundamental way. Rather, they provide additional information to 
analysts that can help guide future assessments with the PR&PP method­
ology. The focus of the update on metrics is in the area of proliferation 
resistance. The update on expert elicitation can be used for application to 
both proliferation resistance and physical protection.
Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) have seen a resurgence of interest in the 
past decade around the world. Support for these activities is provided from 
both national and private sources. The largest difference from the 2011 GIF 
MSR PR&PP evaluation consequently is the transition from evaluating 
academic systems focused on exploring the technical potential of MSRs to 
those of companies and countries focusing on near-term deployment.
A wide variety of designs currently exist ranging from solid to liquid- 
fueled designs, with salt processing on-site or off-site, and a variety of fuel 
choices [1, 2]. As such, the proliferation resistance and physical protection

Generation IV international forum 209
(PR&PP) aspects will have significantly more variation depending on 
reactor design than the other advanced reactors. This document, prepared 
jointly by the GIF PRPPWG and the GIF MSR pSSC, follows the 
high-level paradigm of the GIF Proliferation Resistance and Physical 
Protection Evaluation Methodology to investigate the PR&PP features of 
the GIF MSR representative designs (GIF/PRPPWG/2023/001). The 
rapid introduction and evolution of innovative MSR designs inevitably 
mean that technology specific details of overview reports, such as this one, 
become rapidly outdated. Consequently, this report focuses on essential 
features required for any MSR rather than specific design aspects.
22.4.4 VHTR/MSR materials and components R&D workshop 
MSR pSSC, in collaboration with GIF’s VHTR material PMB, held an 
international workshop on September 18, 2019 at Avignon in France. This 
workshop provided a forum for advanced reactor stakeholders to discuss the 
state of knowledge, operating experience, and research activities related to 
high-temperature metallic and nonmetallic materials, coolant chemistry, 
reactor component integrity, and applicable codes and standards.
The purpose of the workshop is to assess the current understanding 
and develop future research needs to better prepare the regulatory infra­
structure to license advanced reactors, in the areas of materials and com­
ponent integrity. The format for the workshop sessions was structured to 
allow for thorough discussions and sharing valuable insights and perspec­
tives. Experts from the United States, France, Korea, China, Australia, 
and European Union presented and discussed 11 topics on VHTR and 
MSR materials.
22.4.5 Contribution for GIF publication
22.4.5.1 Annual report
MSR pSSC has been introducing their activities in the GIF annual report, 
which is published annually by GIF since 2007 (GIF Annual report 2007, 
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 
2021, 2022). At the beginning, the activities related to MSFR-related 
research, which is a reference reactor, and the development of MSR cross­
cutting technology such as corrosion were explained. Since then, the num­
ber of member countries has gradually increased, and the types of reactors 
they are interested in have diversified, and the latest research trends of par­
ticipating countries are included in the annual report.

22.4.5.2 A technology roadmap for generation IV nuclear energy 
systems
As the Generation IV goals were being finalized, preparations were made 
to develop the Generation IV technology roadmap. In order to develop a 
process to systematically evaluate the potential of proposed Generation IV 
nuclear energy systems to meet the Generation IV goals, Groups of inter­
national experts were organized to undertake identification and evaluation 
of candidate systems and to define R&D to support them. At the same 
time, a solicitation was issued worldwide, requesting that concept propo­
nents submit information on nuclear energy systems that they believe 
could meet some or all of the Generation IV goals. Nearly 100 concepts 
and ideas were received from researchers in a dozen countries.
Technical Working Groups (TWGs) collected their concepts into sets 
of concepts with similar attributes. The TWGs conducted an initial 
screening, termed screening for potential, to eliminate those concepts or 
concept sets that did not have reasonable potential for advancing the goals 
or were too distant or technically infeasible. Others include Fuel Cycle 
Crosscut Group formed to explore the impact of the choice of fuel cycle 
on major elements of sustainability and to cover economics, risk and 
safety, fuels and materials, and energy products. As a result of the evalua­
tion, six types of reactors were selected: VHTR, SFR, SCWR, GFR, 
LFR, and MSR.
Given the changing circumstances after 10 years of collaborative 
work, the GIF Policy Group decided to update the original 2002 
Technology Roadmap. The main objective of this update is to focus on 
the most relevant developments of the six GEN IV systems originally 
selected and provide, to the extent possible, a realistic high-level techni­
cal progress report.
The goal of this report is to assess the current technology status of 
each system, using the general classification of viability, performance, 
demonstration or commercialization phases, and to identify the key 
remaining R&D challenges as well as ways of overcoming them through 
the GIF international collaboration framework.
MSR pSSC contributed to the roadmap of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA).
22.4.5.3 GIF R&D outlook for generation IV nuclear energy systems 
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) is undertaking necessary 
R&D to develop the next generation of innovative nuclear energy 

Generation IV international forum 211
systems that can supplement today’s nuclear plants and transition nuclear 
energy into the long term. With regard to the challenge of maintaining 
the R&D infrastructure, the GIF strongly supports the coordinated 
revitalization of nuclear R&D infrastructure worldwide to a level that 
would once again move a new generation forward quickly. This 
Generation IV R&D Outlook provides a view of what the GIF mem­
bers hope to achieve collectively in the next five years. As always, each 
Forum member is free to choose the systems that they will advance. 
The various sections introduce the systems that we are advancing and 
the goals that we are working toward. They also describe the horizon­
tal work we do in support of all our technologies, highlighting vital 
areas such as quality management, system integration and assessment, 
and collaborations around the world.
The first edition was published in August 2009, described technical 
features and outlook for six advanced reactors those of VHTR, SFR, 
SCWR, GFR, LFR, and MSR. The 2018 update to 2009 GIF R&D 
Outlook has a purpose to present the major outcomes achieved by the 
Forum partners in pursuing the R&D objectives specified in the 2014 
update to the GIF Technology Roadmap. Additionally, this report aims 
to identify remaining or new challenges and the R&D needed to over­
come them on the path to viability, performance demonstration or, in 
some cases, the demonstration/deployment of the respective fourth gener­
ation (Gen IV) system.
MSR pSSC provided main MSR R&D challenges as identified in the 
2014 Roadmap Update and major achievements in response to these chal­
lenges on the 2018 Update (Fig. 22.3).

214 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
A meeting in 2015 organized by the IAEA concluded that there were 
no known fundamental technical hurdles that would prevent MSR tech­
nology from being a safe and feasible energy solution, and that this technol­
ogy could be commercially demonstrated within the next two decades, 
provided the necessary funding is available. However, it also recognized 
that many engineering challenges have to be solved, and the economic 
competitiveness needs to be studied further. A meeting in 2016 identified 
the need to prepare an IAEA publication documenting status of MSR 
technology. The IAEA convened a group of international experts on this 
subject during subsequent years and produced a publication covering this 
status (IAEA, 2021a), which will be published in full by IAEA.
Section 23.2 contains text from this IAEA publication (reproduced 
with permission) to describe a taxonomy of MSRs and the current non­
technical challenges for deploying them. Section 23.3 provides an over­
view of the review on the applicability of the IAEA Safety Standards to 
advanced reactors, including MRSs, which was a result of an IAEA proj­
ect initiated in 2020. The full results will be available in a forthcoming 
IAEA publication. Finally, Section 23.4 briefly describes other activities 
related to MSRs and thorium.
23.2 Report on the “status of molten salt reactor 
technology”
The IAEA prepared a preprint (final draft version) of a Technical Reports 
Series (TRS) on the “Status of Molten Salt Reactor Technology” (IAEA, 
2021a). The draft covers a brief history of MSR technology; discusses 
advantages and technological challenges of MSRs; offers a classification 
(taxonomy) of MSR families (types of MSRs), including a description of 
each MSR family; elaborates on current research and development 
(R&D) activities on MSR technology, organized by Member State; dis­
cusses major non-technical challenges for deploying MSRs; and provides 
conclusions. The draft also offers five appendices. One appendix describes 
some current MSR concepts, including those that may still be at a con­
ceptual level. The other four appendices provide details about the history 
of MSR technology in Poland and Switzerland, China, France, and 
Russia. Most of this information is largely covered elsewhere in this book, 
so the focus of this chapter is on summarizing the taxonomy of MSRs 
and the current non-technical challenges for deploying MSRs.

23.2.1 Taxonomy of molten salt reactors
23.2.1.1 Introduction to the taxonomy
Molten salt reactors are a broad and diverse category of reactors, in which 
a molten salt plays one or more significant functions in the reactor core, 
such as fuel chemical form, liquid fuel carrier, coolant, or moderator. All 
historical and recent concepts rely either on fluoride or chloride salts. 
Other halides or other salts, for instance, the industrially used nitrate salt, 
are not considered because one or more of their properties, such as radiol­
ysis of the salt without recombination, high neutron absorption or activa­
tion, low solubility of fuel salt, or unfavorable melting points disqualify 
them for use in the reactor core. Also, the homogeneous mixture of 
fluorides and chlorides is not considered. It was evaluated briefly early in 
the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program (Fraas and Savolainen, 
1954) and recently mentioned by TerraPower (2016). Such a mixture 
would have high neutron absorption in moderated reactors and softer 
neutron spectrum than stand-alone chlorides in fast reactors. Furthermore, 
it will strongly increase the complexity of the chemistry of the fuel salt.
MSR development spans about seven decades, that is, since the late 
1940s. Some of the conceived MSR concepts are based on a relatively 
simple idea, typically related to the fuel cycle arrangement, and rely only 
on neutronic simulations; other concepts were supported by substantial 
R&D effort, and their Technological Readiness Level (TRL) is high (EU, 
2014). A prominent example of a design class that is well developed is the 
graphite-based MSRs.
In the past, there were several efforts to classify MSRs, for example, 
see (Smith et al., 1974; Taube, 1978). The contribution described in 
Taube (1978) to the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation project 
(INFCE), which was supported by IAEA, is especially relevant because it 
includes detailed discussion of an MSR classification. It uses the following 
classification parameters: method of cooling, flux intensity, number of 
core zones, type of fuel cycle, neutron spectrum, and salt type. The 
method of cooling was selected as the foremost criterion and defines three 
major MSR groups based on the location of the heat exchange between 
fuel and dedicated coolant and on whether the coolant and liquid fuel are 
in direct contact or not. The three groups defined were: internally indi­
rectly cooled MSRs, externally indirectly cooled MSRs, and internally 
directly cooled MSRs. For internally cooled reactors, the heat exchange 
between fuel and coolant takes place in the active core; for externally 

216 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
cooled, it is outside of the core. This classification is, however, outdated 
because (1) the directly cooled MSRs, where liquid fuel and coolant are 
in direct contact, are not considered as a promising option anymore, (2) 
several classification parameters from the extensive list of possible para­
meters for classifying MSRs (*: See below) were not considered at that 
time, and (3) some recent MSR concepts introduced non-graphite mod­
erating materials, which are different to those used in the past ANP (Fraas 
and Savolainen, 1954) and molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) research 
programs (Briant and Weinberg, 1957; MacPherson et al., 1957) at Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Unlike graphite, these moderators 
are not compatible with the salt and require coating or cladding material 
to avoid direct contact. Accordingly, they have different technological 
and safety requirements than those for the MSRs that are moderated by 
graphite. From this perspective, these concepts are similar with internally 
indirectly cooled MSRs, where structural material is needed in the core to 
separate the fuel salt from the dedicated coolant.
(*) Parameters that have typically been considered for MSR classification 
are: technological readiness level (low, medium, high), fuel state (liquid, 
solid), neutron spectrum (thermal, epithermal, fast, hybrid, variable), fuel 
cooling (in-core, ex-core), contact with coolant (direct, indirect), moderator 
(graphite, hydrogen based, deuterium based, beryllium based, other), num­
ber of actinides containing salts (single-fluid, two-fluids, multi-fluids), salt 
type (fluorides, chlorides, mixture), salt purpose (fissile, fertile, coolant, 
moderator), core criticality (critical, subcritical), primary circuit layout (loop, 
pool), core structure (homogeneous, heterogeneous), use of neutron leak­
age (reflector, blanket, multi-zone core), neutronics design (burner, con­
verter, breeder, breed-and-burn), make-up fuel (enriched uranium, existing 
spent fuel, none), fuel cycle (open, partially closed, closed), breeding (Th-U 
cycle, U-Pu cycle, combination), fuel reprocessing location (in-situ, ex­
situ), fuel reprocessing pace (as fast as possible, with years of delay, combina­
tion, no reprocessing), fuel refilling/removing (continuously, batch-wise, at 
once, none), and power level (micro, small, large).
23.2.1.2 Definition of major molten salt reactor classes and families 
There are many parameters and options on how to develop an MSR tax­
onomy. Some of the parameters may or may not be important for its 
structure. The taxonomy developed herein to classify major MSR con­
cepts is partly inspired by the previous classification (Taube, 1978), but 
the technological similarities play a more important role in it. The 

International Atomic Energy Agency 217
taxonomy covers most of the concepts that have been proposed to date 
and constitutes from three major classes of MSRs:
1. Graphite-based MSRs
2. Homogeneous MSRs
3. Heterogeneous MSRs
Since some, usually peculiar or smaller power, concepts can be on 
the border between two classes or not fully congruent with a class def­
inition, a fourth class is introduced to address them:
4. Other MSRs
Each class has its own specific features:
• 
Graphite-based MSRs are characterized by graphite presence in the 
core and use exclusively fluoride salt and thermal spectrum. Since the 
graphite is directly compatible with the salt, there is no need for other 
structural material in the core. This class has the highest TRL level, 
because of the successful operation of the molten salt reactor experi­
ment (MSRE), and for some concepts because of their similarity to 
High-Temperature Reactors (HTRs).
• 
Homogeneous MSRs are characterized by the absence of structural 
materials whose function is to separate the fuel salt from a coolant or a 
moderator in the core, which is thus filled solely by the fuel salt. 
Optionally, there can be structural materials (e.g., baffles for flow 
direction) in the core; however, they do not have the separation func­
tion. The TRL of this class depends mainly on the fuel salt, and for 
some of the MSRs using similar salts to those of the MSRE or 
MSBR, the TRL can be higher than for others.
• 
Heterogeneous MSRs are characterized by the presence of structural 
material in the core that is separating the fuel salt from a dedicated 
coolant or from a moderator not directly compatible with the fuel salt. 
The TRL of this class depends also on the separation material and can 
be lower than for the previous two classes because these materials are 
typically not yet qualified.
• 
Other MSRs, which do not fit the three major classes, have generally 
the lowest TRL.
I. Class
Graphite-based MSRs are moderated by graphite and can be further sub­
divided into two families according to the form of the fuel:
• 
Fluoride salt-cooled solid fuel reactors. In this family of reactors, the fuel is 
in the form of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particles, distributed in 

218 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
the graphite moderator, which most commonly has either plate or 
pebble shape and the core is cooled by fluoride salt, typically 7LiF- 
BeF2 eutectic. Concepts from this family are actually classical reactors 
with solid fuel and share many features with the HTRs; for instance, 
the very low specific actinides density. The pebble-bed option shares 
some fuel cycle features of a reactor with liquid fuel that are: (1) con­
tinuous refueling operation, and (2) nearly homogeneous core compo­
sition obtained as a result of small fuel element stochastic distribution 
and multiple passes of pebbles in the core. Nevertheless, significant dif­
ferences exist. As fuel is segregated within pebbles, online isotopic sep­
aration is not possible as in liquid fuel but, differently from salt, 
pebbles can be discerned and discarded according to burn-up level. 
The low specific fuel density and the solid state of the fuel disable sus­
tainable breeding in these reactors. Accordingly, they rely on enriched 
uranium (typically . 8% 235U); optionally, they can act as burners. 
Using fluoride salt as coolant enables higher specific power than in an 
HTR cooled by helium. On the other hand, it results in higher spe­
cific decay heat, which cannot be removed only by passive radiation as 
in the HTR case and need to rely on coolant natural circulation.
• 
Graphite-moderated liquid fuel MSRs. These MSRs represent the most 
developed MSRs and use fluoride carrier salt as a diluent for actinide 
fluorides. Compared with the fluoride salt-cooled reactors, these con­
cepts can reach much higher specific fuel density. Since the fuel is liq­
uid, its continuous treatment is enabled, and breeding can be achieved 
for selected salt types in the closed Th-U fuel cycle. These reactors 
can be operated in single-fluid or two-fluids layouts and include bur­
ners fueled by transuranics (TRU), converters fueled by enriched ura­
nium, and breeders in the Th-U cycle.
In both graphite-based families, graphite has limited lifespan due to 
irradiation. In reactors cooled by fluoride salt, graphite acts as a fuel matrix 
and is naturally exchanged when the fuel is depleted. The volume of dis­
charged spent fuel is typically much higher than for existing light water 
reactors, but its form is suitable for final repository. In a graphite­
moderated MSR, the graphite has to be regularly replaced solely due to 
its limited lifespan. It generates voluminous activated waste.
A third family, which is not considered here, can be based on a com­
bination of the previous two options and applicable especially for the 
transition cycle. The fuel (e.g., enriched uranium) can be embedded in 
the graphite as TRISO particles, and the fertile material (e.g., thorium)

International Atomic Energy Agency 219
can be diluted in the fluoride salt. However, this design may result in pos­
itive coolant-density and coolant-void reactivity effects.
II. Class
Homogeneous MSRs are characterized by a fast neutron spectrum and 
core filled solely by the fuel salt. The two major families are determined 
by the salt type, fluoride or chloride, as follows:
• Homogeneous fluoride fast MSRs. They have probably the second highest 
TRL level after the Graphite-based MSRs. This would be especially 
valid for the fuel salt used during MSRE or planned for MSBR. 
However, these particular salts contain beryllium and can be consid­
ered as moderating. Therefore, they are usually not applied for 
Homogeneous fluoride fast MSRs. The TRL level for other fluoride 
salts may differ between the salt types. These reactors belong to the 
category of fast spectrum reactors. However, even without beryllium 
in the salt, their neutron spectrum is one of the softest from fast reac­
tors. Depending on the reactor design, they can be operated as bree­
ders in the closed Th-U and U-Pu cycles, as converters fueled by 
enriched uranium or as waste burners. For some of the concepts, the 
solubility of trivalent actinides or lanthanides (e.g., PuF3) could be the 
limiting fuel cycle factor.
• Homogeneous chloride fast MSRs. They are based on chlorides and histor­
ically has less benefit of R&D than the MSRs based on fluorides; 
hence, their TRL level can be lower. These reactors also belong to 
the group of fast spectrum reactors. However, their neutron spectrum 
is much harder than for fluoride fast MSRs and it belongs to the hard­
est spectra between all fast reactors. This is also the most appealing fea­
ture of MSRs based on chlorides. It enables efficient breeding in both 
Th-U and U-Pu closed cycles and even the operation in an open 
breed-and-burn U-Pu cycle. The hard spectrum is, however, accom­
panied by the core transparency for neutrons. Hence, reactors in this 
family suffer much more from the neutron leakage than the 
Homogeneous fluoride fast MSRs and are usually larger. At the same 
time, the solubility of actinides or lanthanides in the fuel salt can be 
higher than in MSRs that are based on fluoride.
III. Class
Heterogeneous MSRs are characterized by the presence of structural 
material in the core that is separating the fuel salt from a dedicated coolant 

220 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
or from a moderator not directly compatible with the fuel salt. The two 
families in this class are defined by the material that needs to be separated. 
In one case it is the moderator, which is not directly compatible with the 
fuel salt, and in the other case it is the dedicated coolant:
• 
Non-graphite-moderated MSRs. They use fuel in the form of fluoride 
salts diluted in fluoride carrier salt and are characterized by thermal 
spectrum and presence of structural materials in the core. There are 
some moderators (e.g., based on beryllium or deuterium) that can 
assure better neutronics performance than graphite. Such concepts 
can be potentially better breeders or waste burners than Graphite­
moderated MSRs. Nonetheless, the performance will strictly depend 
on the characteristics of the separating structural material. It appears 
that only silicon carbide (SiC) can preserve the excellent neutronic 
performance features. However, the lifespan of some of these mod­
erators and structural materials can be significantly larger than graph­
ite, hence producing much less waste, and resulting in the structural 
material lifespan usually determining the lifespan of the reactor. Since 
the TRL of this family depends also on the separation material, it can 
be lower than for other MSRs. However, the only operational expe­
rience of an MSR besides the MSRE is the Aircraft Reactor 
Experiment (ARE), which belongs to this class and operated with a 
beryllium oxide moderator and fluoride fuel salt, separated by 
Inconel tubes.
• 
Heterogeneous chloride fast MSRs. They have their chloride-based fuel 
separated from the dedicated coolant by the structural material. The 
coolant can be another salt or liquid metal, typically lead. So far, none 
of the concepts considers sodium as the coolant. In the salt case, it is 
usually chloride salt, which does not carry actinides. But in some his­
torical concepts, a blanket salt was used to cool the core. Due to the 
structural material and dedicated coolant presence in the core, these 
reactors have higher parasitic neutron absorption in the core than 
Homogeneous chloride fast MSRs. At the same time, the fuel salt 
does not serve as primary heat transport medium and is therefore not 
extensively pumped out of the core. Due to the structural materials, 
which are often not yet qualified, the TRL level of these reactors is 
lower. The heterogeneous fast reactors using fluoride fuel salt and ded­
icated coolant have inferior neutronic performance than both 
Heterogeneous chloride fast MSRs and Homogeneous fluoride fast 
MSRs and are not considered herein.

International Atomic Energy Agency 221
IV. Class
The class “Other MSRs” is needed because not all MSR concepts docu­
mented in the literature can be covered by the three major classes above. 
These concepts are typically historical or discontinued, have the lowest TRL 
level, and are rather exotic. Some of the types included in this class are repre­
sented by more than one concept. For instance, the directly cooled MSRs. 
They were proposed to avoid extensive fuel salt pumping through the high- 
surface heat exchangers or the structural material presence in the active core. 
The high heat exchange surface is needed because the salts have low thermal 
conductivity, which is comparable to water. Since the direct contact leads to 
strong contamination of the direct coolant, all concepts of this type are dis­
continued. Another example of more than one concept are the subcritical 
MSRs, which were proposed during the 1990s as a liquid fuel option of the 
accelerator-driven system. Since the only major function of the costly exter­
nal neutron source is the criticality safety, it can be avoided in inherently safe 
critical MSRs. The remaining types are typically based on single rather hypo­
thetical concepts, which do not fit one of the six defined families or which 
are sometimes not meant for large power production. As an example, the 
gas-cooled MSRs or the frozen salt MSRs can be mentioned here.
23.2.1.3 Molten salt reactor taxonomy
This subsection briefly describes the MSR taxonomy. The first two layers 
of the taxonomy are defined by the three major MSR classes and the six 
major MSRs families. The three identified major MSR classes are:
I. 
Graphite-based MSRs;
II. Homogeneous MSRs;
III. Heterogeneous MSRs.
The six major MSRs families are:
I.1. Fluoride salt cooled reactors (Subsection 23.2.1.4);
I.2. Graphite-moderated MSRs (Subsection 23.2.1.5);
II.3. Homogeneous fluoride fast MSRs (Subsection 23.2.1.6);
II.4. Homogeneous chloride fast MSRs (Subsection 23.2.1.7);
III.5. Non-graphite-moderated MSRs (Subsection 23.2.1.8);
III.6. Heterogeneous chloride fast MSRs (Subsection 23.2.1.9).
The third level of the taxonomy is the outcome of the detailed family 
descriptions in Subsections 23.2.1.4 through 23.2.1.9. Each subsection 
briefly introduces a family and the family’s third layer of the taxonomy.

23.2.1.4 Fluoride salt-cooled solid fuel reactors
Fluoride salt-cooled reactors feature solid fuel, mostly based on coated fuel 
particles embedded in or surrounded by graphite moderator, cooled by 
fluoride salt. Similarly, as in the case of the HTR that is gas-cooled 
(HTGR), the fuel particles can be dispersed in a graphite pebble or concen­
trated in sealed plates or compacts and surrounded by graphite blocks. The 
technology of coated fuel particles was already suggested in 1957 (Huddle 
et al., 1962) for HTR; around the same time when Graphite-moderated 
MSR became a major option for ORNL. Early Fluoride-cooled High- 
temperature Reactor (FHR) designs were based on prismatic blocks and 
TRISO-bearing compacts replicating HTGR prismatic block geometry, 
but such an option was quickly discarded as the average density of the fuel 
blocks would be lower than that of the salt causing the blocks to float and 
making some operations, such as refueling, very challenging. Designs featur­
ing plate, pebble, or stringer fuel have instead gained traction.
Fluoride salt-cooled reactors combine two previously existing technol­
ogies: reactor coolants based on molten fluoride salts operating at high 
temperature and low pressure developed in the USA Aircraft Nuclear 
Propulsion (ANP) program of the 1950s, and the subsequent breeder 
reactor program that was based on molten salt, and solid fuel consisting of 
coated particles (TRISO) embedded in a graphite matrix originally devel­
oped for reactors operating at high temperature and cooled by gas in 
some countries such as Germany and USA. As fuel is based on TRISO 
particles embedded in or surrounded by a graphite moderator, fluoride 
salt-cooled reactors are characterized by a soft neutron spectrum. This fea­
ture restricts the choice for coolant to neutronically favorable fluoride 
salts. Among those, the 7LiF-BeF2 (2:1) eutectic remains the preferred 
option based on neutronics (if enriched in 7Li at 99.995% or higher per­
centage) and thermophysical properties. Although graphite is the main 
moderator, the light components of the salt also contribute to neutrons 
slowing down. Moreover, to obtain negative coolant temperature or 
coolant void reactivity feedback, it is, indeed, necessary that salt modera­
tion is not negligible. Therefore, the coolant scattering cross section 
should have a stronger impact on the neutronics than the capture cross 
section. When the salt temperature increases (causing the salt’s density to 
decrease) or when a void appears in the salt, two competing reactivity 
changes occur: a positive change due to reduced absorption of neutrons in 
the salt, and a negative effect due to the spectrum hardening from reduced 
moderation in the salt. For the latter effect to be dominant and the overall 

International Atomic Energy Agency 225
feedback to be negative, neutron moderation in the salt has to be sizable 
and neutron capture minimal (Fratoni and Greenspan, 2011). Therefore, 
(1) only fluoride salts are suitable for the coolant, (2) 6Li is excluded for its 
high neutron capture cross section, and (3) 9Be is included for its high 
neutron scattering cross section.
As already mentioned, the low specific fuel density and the solid state 
of the fuel disable sustainable breeding in these reactors. Accordingly, they 
rely on enriched uranium (typically .8% 235U); optionally, they can act 
as TRU burners. Using fluoride salt as coolant enables higher specific core 
power than in an HTR cooled by helium. On the other hand, it results 
in higher decay heat that is removed relying on coolant natural circulation 
rather than passive radiation as in the HTR case.
23.2.1.5 Graphite-moderated liquid fuel molten salt reactors
The reactor concepts belonging to this family use graphite as moderator, 
hence the neutron spectrum is thermal. The fuel is liquid in the form of 
actinide fluorides dissolved in a fluoride carrier salt or their mixture, for 
instance, BeF2, 7LiF, or NaF. The fuel has simultaneously the coolant 
function, so it not only conveys the fission heat out of the core but also 
cools the graphite moderator. From the perspective of the fuel cycle, this 
reactor can be operated as a breeder in a closed Th-U fuel cycle, as a con­
verter fueled by enriched uranium, or as TRU burner in open or closed 
fuel cycle. This reactor type has a prominent position from a historical 
perspective (such as the MSRE at ORNL), and the most experimental 
and theoretical effort so far was invested on this technology.
The fuel and the moderator are in direct contact. The capability of 
graphite to withstand this contact was recognized in the early pioneering 
time of the nuclear era. During the ANP program between 1947 and 
1961 (e.g., Ellis and Thompson, 1950) at ORNL, the reactors moderated 
by graphite were excluded as an option for the nuclear-powered jet 
engines because of their size. The associated shielding weight penalty was 
too big (Fraas and Savolainen, 1954). Nonetheless, the benefits of graphite 
features were recognized, and graphite was used or proposed to be used: 
as outer shielding of the reactor moderated by Be (Briant et al., 1955; 
Jordan et al., 1954a), as graphite packed seals (Briant et al., 1953), as 
graphite powder for extinguishing material (Cottrell et al., 1953a), as ves­
sels lined with graphite for fuel salt preparation (Cottrell et al., 1953a), as 
graphite anode for electrochemistry in chlorides (Cottrell et al., 1953b), or 
in the compound UF6-C7F16 (Jordan et al., 1954b). Tests were done 

226 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
within the ANP program for: compatibility of graphite of high density 
with other materials (Briant et al., 1954), and changes in a chemical sys­
tem’s behavior with graphite presence (Savolainen et al., 1954). Many 
other studies were done later (e.g., in MacPherson (1959)), including 
carburization of Inconel and INOR-8, irradiation time and radiation 
damage of graphite, and graphite permeability for molten salts.
The three major requirements for a graphite moderator, which are still 
valid today, are recapitulated in Rosenthal et al. (1972), and state that it 
has to:
• 
withstand neutron irradiation for enough time;
• 
have pores small enough that capillary forces exclude fuel salt; and
• 
have a low enough permeability to gases to keep down the absorption 
of xenon.
ORNL decided to develop a civilian MSR breeder around 1957. In 
(Briant and Weinberg, 1957; MacPherson et al., 1957), the Th-U cycle is 
recognized as an alternative to the U-Pu cycle, and a fluoride salt mixture 
consisting of BeF2, 7LiF (or NaF), UF4, and ThF4 was proposed for both a 
homogeneous fluoride fast MSR and a graphite-moderated MSR. The per­
formance of both reactor concepts was comparable; the moderated reactor 
based on a 7LiF-BeF2 salt even slightly outperformed the fast reactor 
(MacPherson, 1958; Alexander et al., 1959), from the perspectives of con­
version ratio and doubling time. At that time, other moderators were 
excluded because they are not compatible with the fuel salt and the parasitic 
neutron absorption by their respective claddings would disable sustainable 
breeding in the Th-U cycle (MacPherson et al., 1957; MacPherson, 1958). 
This cycle generates the intermediate isotope 233Pa, which decays with 27 
days half-life to 233U and causes parasitic capture of neutrons. It is especially 
pronounced in the thermal spectrum. Hence, it is desirable to remove this 
isotope or to minimize this capture in a graphite-moderated MSR. To 
achieve breeding in the Th-U closed cycle with a graphite-moderated 
MSR, several design solutions are needed: leakage minimization with blan­
ket, reflector, under-moderated outer core zone, bulky core, or a combina­
tion of these features; intensive salt purification from fission products; and 
minimization of 233Pa parasitic capture of neutrons.
Other considerations related to graphite that are relevant for MSR 
application are the following:
• 
Potentially positive effect on reactivity due to temperature;
• 
Large thermal inertia;
• 
Large cores;

International Atomic Energy Agency 227
• 
Slightly under-moderated cores;
• 
Limited lifespan of graphite due to irradiation;
• 
Penetration by salt and gases;
• 
Shrinking and growing under irradiation;
• 
Radioactive graphite waste;
• 
Reactor can operate with a low fissile inventory;
• 
Need for intensive salt cleaning and 233Pa removal in breeder reactor 
concepts;
• 
Complexity of reactor concepts using two fluids;
• 
Graphite reflector can reduce neutron fluence on the reactor vessel;
• 
Graphite is neutronically compatible with moderating 7LiF-BeF2 salt;
• 
Presence of BeF2 decreases salt melting temperature.
23.2.1.6 Homogeneous fluoride fast molten salt reactors
The reactor concepts belonging to this family do not use any moderator, 
making the neutron spectrum fast. The fuel is liquid in the form of acti­
nide fluoride, and the carrier salt is usually 7LiF even if other options with 
BeF2, NaF, and KF are possible. The fuel mixture acts also as coolant, and 
thus the homogeneous fluoride fast MSR belongs to the externally indi­
rectly cooled MSRs. The main options for the fuel cycle are based on 
thorium (Th-U and Th-TRU) allowing the reactors in this category to 
be suitable for breeder and burner applications. Usage of enriched ura­
nium or of the U-Pu cycle is also possible, but may face the issue with tri- 
valent fluorides, for example, PuF3 solubility limit.
Homogeneous fluoride fast MSRs have one of the softest fast spectra, 
and the U-Pu cycle especially suffers from this fact. The Th-U cycle is 
less dependent on the spectrum and acts thus as a reference fuel cycle for 
these reactors. The combination of liquid fuel and fast spectrum allows for 
both waste incineration of the actinides that are long-lived and breeding 
for resource sustainability. This possibility brings different benefits in the 
reactor design, safety, and operation. Firstly, the absence of graphite or 
any other moderator material leads to a simplification of the layout of the 
fuel circuit, typically characterized by the absence of structural internals, 
providing advantages from the neutronics and thermohydraulic points of 
view. However, this absence also reduces thermal inertia of the core and 
results in a higher actinides load. Secondly, due to the reduced neutron 
capture cross section of the fission products (FPs) and due to the increased 
fissile fuel share in the fast spectrum, these reactors are less sensitive to 
FPs, and there is no need for frequent salt treatment.

228 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
From a safety point of view, when compared with thermal reactors, 
these fast MSRs are characterized by (1) highly negative reactivity coeffi­
cient, both for the salt void (thermal expansion) and the temperature 
Doppler effect; (2) a small reactivity swing, (3) a lower tritium production, 
(4) a much shorter lifetime of prompt neutrons, and (5) a lower thermal 
inertia. On the other hand, a fast reactor has a hard neutron spectrum 
because many of the neutrons have high energies, and this spectrum 
causes higher irradiation damage in terms of displacements per atom (dpa) 
to those structural materials that are in direct contact to the salt and not 
protected and shielded by a graphite reflector.
The fuel salt carrier employed by this MSR family is characterized by 
mixtures based on fluoride (typical cations are alkali or alkaline earth ions) 
due to their favorable features in terms of melting and boiling points 
(compatible with reactor design and structural material limitations), low 
capture cross section, and high solubility of actinide and lanthanide fluor­
ides. The latter property is particularly important in this family since the 
fast spectrum requires a much larger fissile and fertile inventory than ther­
mal MSRs. Fluoride salts have good thermophysical properties with 
respect to other candidates (general candidates or salt candidates) in terms 
of density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity. However, they are 
not as good as liquid metals, which are an excellent medium for heat 
exchange, especially in passive decay heat removal (DHR). With respect 
to other candidate salts for a fast MSR (mainly chloride salts), fluoride salts 
can rely on a relatively extensive experience given their use in the MSRs 
moderated by graphite operated in the past as the MSRE and in other 
experimental tests, even if their behavior in an environment with fast neu­
trons is not well established. In addition (always with respect to the chlo­
ride salt option), reactor concepts based on fluoride salts show less hard 
spectrum, a proven compatibility with structural materials (e.g., Hastelloy- 
N), less chemical issues (e.g., chlorine isotope separation is required to 
decrease the production of 36Cl but it is not ready at industrial scale), and 
no sulfur production. On the other hand, using a fluoride salt bearing 
lithium or beryllium can be a concern due to tritium generation, and Li 
also needs isotope separation to decrease tritium production and increase 
the neutron economy.
Different options for fuel cycles are available in this family, according 
to the reactor operation mode, that is, whether the reactor works as TRU 
burner, converter, or breeder. Since the solubility limit of trivalent fluor­
ides often defines the applicable carrier salt, homogeneous fluoride fast

International Atomic Energy Agency 229
MSRs can be generally divided into Th-U breeders and reactors contain­
ing Pu. In the second case, it can be designated as a TRU burner or 
breeder in closed U-Pu cycle. At the same time, 233U is not available in 
sufficient amount, and Th-U breeders will need to be started with 
enriched uranium, reactor grade plutonium, or a mixture of the two. The 
reactor design for such fuel cycle transition will be classified according to 
the applied fuel type.
23.2.1.7 Homogeneous chloride fast molten salt reactors
The Homogeneous chloride fast MSRs are very similar to homogeneous 
fluoride fast MSRs. The obvious major difference is the use of chloride 
salts. Different options in terms of carrier salts are available (Taube, 1961), 
ranging from the alkali (Na, K) and alkaline earth (Ca, Mg) compounds 
to CuCl and ZnCl2. This family is characterized by a hard fast spectrum 
given the absence of light nuclei in the carrier salt, such as Li and Be, usu­
ally used in concepts based on fluoride. This feature is exploited in the 
fuel cycle where the most selected option is the breeder U-Pu cycle, or 
less frequently U-Th cycle. Burner and converter applications are also 
possible, as well as the self-sustaining breed-and-burn U-Pu cycle, which 
avoids the need of fuel enrichment, reprocessing, and separation of 
actinides.
The use of chloride salt was one of the first options considered during 
the first phase of the development of MSR concepts. Being alternative to 
the salts based on fluoride, this option was discarded mainly in favor of 
fluoride, in addition to having the problem related to the activation of 
35Cl into 36Cl, an isotope that is long-lived and a 0.7 MeV beta emitter. 
A solution to this radiotoxicity issue is the chlorine isotopic separation 
with enrichment in 37Cl, but this technology was not considered mature 
at that time. As result, R&D efforts were concentrated in fluoride carriers, 
making experimental data on chloride very limited.
In homogeneous chloride fast reactors, the active core is composed of 
fuel salt with no structural material that may affect the neutronics feature. 
With the power directly released in the fuel salt, the heat exchange with a 
secondary salt takes place outside the active region leading to a loss in 
delayed neutron precursor and an overall increase of the required fissile 
inventory due to the salt volume outside the core active region. For this 
purpose, the higher solubility for the actinides granted by the chloride salts 
allows for a greater actinides load capacity than in fluorides. From a neu- 
tronics point of view, the chloride salts are characterized by the presence 

230 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
of two stable isotopes, 35Cl (75.76%) and 37Cl (24.24%). In addition to 
the production of 36Cl, the 35Cl has a higher capture cross section than 
37Cl, leading to the need of isotopic separation in a chloride fast MSR. 
The low scattering properties of 37Cl, in combination with the low neu­
tron absorption, provide a hard spectrum to this kind of MSR. On the 
other hand, this results also in a large neutron mean free path, requiring a 
reflector or a blanket for counterbalancing the neutron transparency. As 
for the issues related to chemistry, such as corrosion, compatibility with 
structural material, and stability of chloride salts, they require further 
investigation. From a thermohydraulic point of view, the chloride salts 
share similar characteristics with fluoride salts, having good heat transfer 
properties and showing small differences in terms of heat capacity, density, 
and viscosity. In terms of melting point, the chloride salts show a slightly 
lower value than fluoride salts.
23.2.1.8 Non-graphite-moderated molten salt reactors
The reactor concepts belonging to this family are a cohort of moderated 
MSR designs, where the neutron spectrum is thermal, and characterized 
by using non-graphite moderators. From the perspective of the fuel cycle, 
these reactors can be operated as a breeder in a closed Th-U fuel cycle, as 
a converter fueled by enriched uranium, or as a TRU burner in an open 
or closed fuel cycle. These designs separate the fuel salt and moderator 
due to chemical incompatibility and in some cases thermally insulate the 
moderator from the fuel salt. This large MSR family used diverse modera­
tor types, but many of these MSR designs were not actively developed 
after the termination of the ANP program (1947—61) at ORNL.
Broadly, this family can be split up into three main types:
• 
Solid moderator heterogeneous MSRs. The moderator is in the form of 
metals, metal oxides, metal hydrides, or metal carbides. This group 
excludes MSRs moderated by graphite, which is considered a separate 
family, as described in Subsection 23.2.1.5.
• 
Liquid moderator heterogeneous MSRs. The moderator is in the form of 
circulating or stagnant liquid, for example, light water, heavy water, 
metal hydroxides, or metal deuteroxides. This group includes reactors 
cooled by circulating the fuel salt or the moderator.
• 
Hybrid moderator heterogeneous MSRs, using solid and liquid moderators. 
Since this type is discontinued, it is included in the other MSRs class 
(Subsection 23.2.1.10).

International Atomic Energy Agency 231
Homogeneous mixtures of fuel salt and carrier salt, referred to simply 
as “fuel salt,” are not considered moderating enough to be part of this 
family but are, instead, considered a fast reactor; see Subsections 23.2.1.6 
and 23.2.1.7 on homogeneous fluoride and chloride fast MSRs, respec­
tively. However, fluoride fuel salts, especially those containing beryllium 
difluoride, might be characterized as epithermal rather than fast and con­
tribute significant self-moderation in otherwise unmoderated designs.
Concepts with a homogeneous mixture of solid fuel and moderator in 
the form of a molten salt, such as uranium oxide particles suspended in 
molten hydroxide, that is, concepts based on slurry, and concepts with 
heterogeneous solid fuel and same type of moderator, such as solid fuel 
assemblies or pebble beds cooled and moderated with, for example, mol­
ten hydroxide, are characterized as reactors cooled by molten salt and thus 
not part of this family.
Since the ANP program was aiming at jet engines powered by nuclear 
energy, reactors with high outlet temperature, compact dimensions, rea­
sonable weight, and sufficient control stability were required. The com­
pact dimension requirement conflicts with the reactor breeding capability 
for reactors without blankets and the fertile isotope 232Th was excluded 
and 238U minimized.
The different moderator types are listed also in Briant and Weinberg 
(1957), including the direct mixture of liquid moderator with a com­
pound bearing fuel. They are evaluated from a breeder perspective and 
have either low solubility for actinides or include nuclides that absorb 
neutrons. These characteristics deteriorate the breeding performance in a 
thermal spectrum.
When the ANP program was terminated, MSR research at ORNL 
shifted toward developing reactors that produce power, aiming at thermal 
breeder reactors. At that time, other moderators were excluded because 
they were not compatible with the fuel salt and the parasitic neutron 
absorption of the respective cladding would disable sustainable breeding in 
the Th-U cycle (MacPherson et al., 1957; MacPherson, 1958).
Recently, the performance of selected moderators and fuel salts was 
evaluated in the closed Th-U fuel cycle (Hombourger, 2018). When the 
cladding material is neglected, moderators based on beryllium and deute­
rium, namely beryllium metal, beryllium oxide ceramic, and heavy water, 
neutronically outperform the graphite. The study did not include 7LiOD, 
which is likely to have similar neutronic performance to heavy water. 
Moderators based on hydrogen, even with the neglected cladding, are not 

232 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
applicable for sustainable breeding. When the metallic cladding containing 
Hastelloy or SS316 is considered, moderators based on beryllium and deu­
terium are not applicable for such breeding, either. The only applicable 
cladding material that allows sustainable breeding is SiC. However, both 
beryllium and heavy water with SiC cladding neutronically outperform 
graphite moderators breeding performance, making them the highest neu- 
tronically performing thermal spectrum MSRs. For a power reactor, ber­
yllium will likely require internal cooling while heavy water can be 
circulated for cooling.
The now defunct Transatomic Power considered a solid moderator 
made of zirconium hydrate (ZrH) in direct contact with the fuel salt and 
possibly chemically stabilized with lithium hydride (LiH) and yttrium 
hydride (YH) (Massie and Dewan, 2013).
The limited life of graphite under radiation, issues related to ingress of 
fuel salt and gaseous species, and possibly improved neutron economy and 
lower fissile inventory have led to liquid moderator being the focus of 
recent MSR developments. Liquid moderators mainly have infinite life­
time, similar to the fuel salts, resulting in the cladding material lifetime 
setting the overall possible reactor lifetime; for example, SiC cladding has 
significantly larger resistance to reactor irradiation than metal alloys that 
are compatible with fuel salt.
23.2.1.9 Heterogeneous chloride fast molten salt reactors
The reactor concepts belonging to this family do not use any moderator, 
and the neutron spectrum is fast. The fuel has the form of liquid actinide 
chlorides with or without some chloride carrier salts. The carrier salts can 
be NaCl, MgCl2, KCl, CaCl2, or a mixture of them. Other options for 
the carrier salts are possible but seldom reported. As a common practice 
for this family, the fuel salt does not perform the coolant function and is 
physically separated from the dedicated coolant. In some older concepts, 
the blanket salt was used as the fuel coolant (Alexander, 1963; Taube, 
1974). The options for the fuel cycle can be U-Pu burning or breeding, 
U-Th burning or breeding, or TRU burning, thus allowing the reactors 
in this family to be suitable for different applications. Due to the presence 
of structural materials and dedicated coolant, the neutron economy of 
Heterogeneous chloride fast MSRs is tighter when compared with 
Homogeneous chloride fast MSRs. Nevertheless, the once-through 
breed-and-burn U-Pu cycle is possible (Kasam and Shwageraus, 2016; 
Kasam et al., 2020).

International Atomic Energy Agency 233
Reactors in this family share many characteristics with other fast spec­
trum MSRs. They allow the possibilities of waste incineration of the acti­
nides that are long-lived and breeding for resource sustainability. The 
installed core power depends on the heat exchange surface of the separat­
ing material. At the same time, liquid fuel can withstand higher tempera­
tures than the solid fuel and the dedicated coolant circulation can be fast. 
Hence, compact reactor core designs with a high core power density are 
possible. The absence of moderator also eliminates one of the constraints 
on the reactor core lifetime set by moderator materials such as graphite. 
Nonetheless, the lifetime of fuel pins is also limited. Thanks to the 
reduced capture cross section of the FPs in the fast spectrum, there is no 
need for frequent salt treatment to remove neutron poisons. On the other 
hand, fast reactors have hard neutron spectra causing more severe radiation 
damage in terms of dpa to those structural materials that are in direct con­
tact to the salt and not shielded by a moderator or reflector than thermal 
reactors.
Unlike the homogenous MSRs, the reactors in this family usually use 
fuel pins or assemblies in the reactor core to contain fuel salts. The 
approach reduces the volume of the fuel salt. The arrangement of the core 
can be similar to the ones commonly seen in the reactors cooled by water 
or the sodium fast reactors, so it may help to reduce the difficulty in model­
ing the reactor core. For reactors that do not circulate the fuel salt, the 
contamination of the components by the fuel salt can be minimized. 
However, the introduction of the structural materials into the reactor core 
will impact the neutron economy and require the qualification of the struc­
tures such as the fuel pins or assemblies. The fuel of Heterogeneous chlo­
ride fast MSRs usually uses enriched 37Cl as the salt base.
The fuel salts used by this family are usually mixtures of chlorides due 
to their favorable features in terms of melting and boiling points, low cap­
ture cross sections, and high solubility of actinide and lanthanide chlorides. 
The high solubility of actinides such as plutonium is particularly important 
for this family since fast reactors require a much larger fissile and fertile 
inventory than their thermal counterparts. Chloride fuel is expected to 
have good stability at high burnup and at high temperatures. It also has 
good thermophysical properties with respect to other types of nuclear fuel 
in terms of density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity.
With respect to other candidate salts for fast MSRs (mainly fluoride 
salts), chloride salts have a superior solubility of actinides. Reactors based 
on the chloride fuel tend to have harder neutron spectra, which may 

234 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
result in better burning rates if designed as waste burners. Historically, 
more effort was devoted to developing MSRs using fluoride salts than to 
those using chloride salts. The issues of using the FLiBe salt, which was 
the one used in the MSRE by ORNL, caused by the 6Li isotope and the 
beryllium health hazard are widely recognized. On the other hand, the 
36Cl that is produced mainly from the activation of 35Cl may be a chal­
lenge for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel from the reactors using the 
chloride fuel salt because 36Cl has an extremely long half-life and a high 
solubility in water.
Different options for fuel cycles are available in this family. For TRU 
burning, the reactors are usually fueled by spent nuclear fuel from reactors 
cooled by water. For U-Pu burning or breeding, the reactors are usually 
fueled by uranium and reactor grade plutonium. For Th-U burning or 
breeding, the reactors are usually fueled by thorium, reactor grade pluto­
nium, or uranium.
23.2.1.10 Other molten salt reactors
There are several MSR concepts that do not fit the six major families. 
Even though these concepts have the lowest TRL level and are rather 
exotic, they are still classified herein into the following types:
• 
Directly cooled MSRs. They were considered in the past, and there are 
about half a dozen concepts ranging from 1955 to 1974. The ideal of 
directly cooled MSRs is to avoid the large heat exchange surface 
needed for the salts, because of their low thermal conductivity, which 
is similar to water. The biggest disadvantage of the “Directly cooled 
MSRs” family is the coolant contamination by actinides and fission 
products.
• 
Subcritical MSRs. They were studied in the 1990s, when great interest 
was dedicated to the Accelerator-Driven System (ADS). The purposes 
were nuclear waste burning and energy production. The major disad­
vantages of these nuclear systems are the cost of the accelerator and 
the complexity of the associated neutron spallation target. Since an 
MSR using liquid fuel can be designed as a waste burner with all ther­
mal reactivity feedback coefficients negative, in a critical MSR like the 
Molten Salt Actinide Recycler and Transformer (MOSART), critical­
ity safety is no more a major concern and there is no need to resort to 
ADS, thus eliminating the accelerator and the spallation target.
• 
Hybrid moderator MSRs. Many of the reactor concepts considered by 
the ANP program were hybrids of solid and liquid moderators. Solid 

International Atomic Energy Agency 235
metal Be moderator performance was deemed the most effective solu­
tion. Reflector materials were treated similarly, and also NaOH, 
NaOD, and 7LiOD were considered. However, their moderating per­
formance was limited by the predominantly forward scattering, and Be 
performed better because it is heavier (Fraas and Savolainen, 1954). 
The Hybrid moderator MSRs use a homogeneous mixture of modera­
tor and fuel salt: this could be a mixture of liquid moderator and fuel 
salt, for example, hydroxide-fluorides mixtures, or principally a mix­
ture of fuel salt and moderator slurry with solid particles suspended in 
fuel salt. The reflector-moderated MSRs also can be included here. 
They are on the edge between Graphite-moderated MSRs and homo­
geneous fluoride fast MSRs. The fluoride salt includes beryllium and 
has thus itself moderation power. The homogeneous core is, further­
more, surrounded by graphite reflector. The importance of thermal 
spectrum decreases with increasing core size.
• 
Chloride salt-cooled fast reactors. The chloride salt can be also used as 
coolant for a fast reactor with solid fuel and a bonding material in the 
fuel pin. The disadvantages of the usual coolants for fast reactors can 
be avoided by using chloride salt as a coolant. However, the salt cool­
ant introduces additional complexity.
• 
Frozen salt reactors. They rely on solid fuel in salt form. Accordingly, 
they belong to heterogeneous MSRs, which require dedicated liquid 
coolant and separating structural material. The frozen state enables low 
operating temperatures. At the same time, the fuel can be occasionally 
re-melted and purified. Therefore, this concept has similar advantages 
and disadvantages as a reactor with solid fuel including orificing of the 
coolant flow and possible hotspots presence. The major advantage and 
disadvantage are the fuel melting temperature. It may be too low to 
achieve fuel freezing during nominal operation and too high to be re­
melted for purification.
• 
Hybrid spectrum MSRs. They are characterized by the presence of both 
thermal and fast spectra in the core. This design option is usually 
applied to minimize the neutron leakage. The core often acts as a flux 
trap, where the multiplication factor is much higher in the center than 
on the periphery. There are also concepts with variable neutron spec­
tra, where manipulation with the core composition or geometry results 
in spectral changes.
• 
Heterogeneous gas-cooled MSRs. The gas coolant has been considered for 
a heterogeneous chloride fast MSR.

23.2.2 Current major non-technical challenges for deploying 
molten salt reactors
While MSR technology operability was demonstrated in the 1960s during 
the MSRE program at ORNL, a few technical and developmental chal­
lenges lie ahead of modern MSR commercial deployment. These can be 
divided into three macro areas: (1) reactor physics, (2) salt chemistry and 
materials science, and (3) engineering. Challenges that are of a less technical 
nature, such as related to the supply chain, licensing, and regulatory aspects, 
are better characterized as non-technical challenges and are addressed in this 
subsection. Since most challenges are ultimately related to technical issues, 
there is no clear distinction between technical and non-technical challenges. 
Therefore, there is some overlap between the challenges discussed in this 
subsection and those related to technical challenges, which are described 
and discussed elsewhere in this book and in IAEA (2021a).
Accordingly, this subsection focuses on the challenges associated with 
deploying MSRs and possible solutions to these challenges. It is noteworthy, 
however, that methods or processes for overcoming any specific challenge are 
mainly incumbent upon decision-making by the technology development 
organization facing the challenge, as well as governments and regulatory bod­
ies. Other stakeholders in the project of an MSR may also support developing 
these methods or processes and this decision-making. Furthermore, many of 
the issues are specific to the region where the MSR is to be deployed.
The types of challenges that are considered to be the most significant 
are the following: (1) supply chain, (2) fuel supply, (3) regulation, (4) fuel 
salt waste disposal, (5) safeguards and security, (6) maintenance and opera­
tion, and (7) program documentation. The next subsections discuss each 
type of challenge. A possible or potential solution to a type of challenge is 
discussed at the end of each subsection.
This subsection does not discuss existing policy challenges related to 
deployment of MSRs due to the significant difference in policy positions 
between Member States. It remains incumbent upon each Member State 
and organization developing an MSR to assess the policy positions relative 
to its region of interest to understand the challenges associated with such 
development in that region.
23.2.2.1 Supply chain challenges
Many of the components and structures required by various MSR designs 
do not have an existing supplier base or full technical specifications necessary 

International Atomic Energy Agency 237
for their specialized materials and components. Depending on the regulatory 
framework, MSRs may be able to rely upon commercial-grade high-tem­
perature technology for industrial processes. Some heat transfer components 
capable of supporting the operating environments presented by an MSR, 
such as heat exchangers, vessels, and instruments, are currently available in 
the market. The lack of other components and scarcity of manufacturers 
lead to the challenges of sourcing new suppliers. This sourcing challenge 
will also include difficulties in developing, controlling, and maintaining a 
nuclear safety culture, obtaining technical expertise, and ensuring knowledge 
transfer across the global supply chain. Additionally, qualification of materials 
and manufacturing methods is critical, whether nuclear or non-nuclear stan­
dards for high temperature are used.
The solution to the supply chain challenge depends on the need or 
market for MSRs. That is, if there is a demand, a supplier will appear. 
This rule does not necessarily work the other way around.
Qualification of suppliers
Inspecting and certifying manufacturing facilities for MSRs are currently 
difficult if the manufacturer desires to follow an established, conventional 
nuclear standard such as Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) (ASME, 
2019) of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), which 
is not directly related to molten salt media. In addition, attempts to use 
limited capabilities and limited manufacturing facilities may cause long 
lead times. Risk is increased if required components have to come from a 
link, which has limitations in its capability, within the supply chain. This 
difficulty associated with qualifying facilities and suppliers is common 
among advanced high-temperature reactor developers, especially those 
that have not chosen to use materials qualified by existing standards.
Because many developers are new entrants into the industry, they 
have limited experience or capability to qualify a supplier. Developers 
have to be diligent and oversee the suppliers to ensure that correct design 
standards and quality assurance standards are followed. Without fully vet­
ting and qualifying suppliers, the risk of substandard components being 
supplied is heightened.
The solution for qualification of suppliers also depends on the need or 
market for MSRs. Taking lessons learned from the MSRE and with par­
ticipation of current nuclear plant equipment suppliers in the deployment 
stage, this issue can be resolved. For the suppliers to sell their products, 
they need to be able to be qualified for this purpose.

238 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Physical infrastructure considerations
Although physical infrastructure is generally considered to be regionally 
specific, the status of existing physical infrastructure to support MSR 
deployment presents a challenge. Roads, ports, railways, shipping lanes, 
heavy haul routes, heavy transportation, and heavy lifting, most of which 
are project and technology specific, have to be adequate. The unavailabil­
ity of satisfactory infrastructure for a specific MSR deployment project 
can result in significant challenges to deployment and for meeting sche­
dules associated with critical paths.
The solution for establishing physical infrastructure could be to use the 
current nuclear plant deployment systems. Besides, deployment of MSRs 
as small modular reactors (SMRs) may be facilitated due to smaller and 
lighter structures and components of SMRs, which may not need as 
sophisticated physical infrastructure as large nuclear projects.
Reactor developer and supplier engagement
Early engagement between reactor developers and suppliers has long been 
viewed as critical to success; however, carrying it out requires a delicate 
balancing act between timing, need, availability, cost, price, competition, 
and risk. Accomplishing this goal requires obtaining a strategic and coop­
erative fit between the supply chain strategy of developers and the com­
petitive strategy of the suppliers; an arrangement that is very difficult to 
achieve. Developers have historically chosen to strategically delay selection 
of suppliers, whereas suppliers tend to drive toward securing early rela­
tionships with the developers. Although the timing, engagement, and 
decisions made by any particular developer of an MSR will be different 
for almost every component or service required to deploy its particular 
design, the need for both the developer and the supplier to be ready for 
engagement is paramount to success.
The solution to the lack of engagement between developers and sup­
pliers depends on the progress of the deployment of MSRs in the market. 
Since the developers and suppliers are likely based in different countries 
and probably continents, an international cooperation is required.
23.2.2.2 Fuel supply challenges
Current developers of MSRs are contemplating a multitude of fuel types 
and associated suppliers. Fuels include enriched uranium, plutonium from 
used nuclear fuels, transuranic elements from used fuels, and 233U pro­
duced from fertile thorium. Each MSR using liquid fuel will need to 

International Atomic Energy Agency 239
have a fuel salt specification to support purchasing. Fuel salt composition 
and tolerance standards are still being developed.
Most MSRs with fast spectra will require uranium enrichment 
greater than 5% for their initial cores. Hence, for Member States that 
currently impose a regulatory limit on the production of low enriched 
uranium (LEU) to less than 5%, there is a need for regulators and gov­
ernment agencies to consider how to authorize production, transporta­
tion, and use of this material. More generally, a strategic plan for MSR 
fuel cycles showing where and when materials will be generated, trans­
ferred, used, stored, and disposed has to be developed—just like for any 
other nuclear fuel.
Since the current fuel supply for LEU and mixed oxide fuel (MOX) 
fuels is based on the solid fuel industry, producing molten salt with 
U/Pu/Th needs new facilities or equipment. Nevertheless, these facilities 
or equipment are similar to those used in the existing chemical industry, 
though dealing with radioactive material entails additional complications. 
Some MSRs are often compared with chemical reprocessing plants more 
than with conventional nuclear power plants. The same is assumed as 
before, that is, if demand exists, supply will appear.
HALEU fuel supply challenges
Available data (IAEA, 2022) provide evidence that many MSRs under 
development are planning to use fuel enrichment levels that require high 
assay low enriched uranium (HALEU), that is, uranium enrichment is 
. 5 wt.% and , 20 wt.%, which is a supply challenge, as described above. 
An MSR reactor under development planning to use less than this enrich­
ment or that is located in Member States where there is an availability of 
HALEU will not encounter this challenge.
The use of HALEU is potentially problematic in many Member States 
due to the lack of regulatory requirements for the fabrication, transporta­
tion, and use of this type of fuel. Introduction of HALEU for advanced 
reactors, including MSRs, is being promoted by a nuclear organization in 
the USA (NEI, 2018).
Uranium-plutonium and transuranic (spent fuel) fuel supply 
challenges
A significant investment may be required for developing the necessary 
infrastructure capable of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from currently 
operating reactors to make available the required feedstock material for 

240 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
fabrication of the fuel for an MSR. On the other hand, reprocessing spent 
nuclear fuel is expected to reduce the amount of radioactive waste for 
final disposal. This reduction has benefits in several areas, including finan­
cial and environmental benefits.
The solution for using Pu or minor actinides fuels can be limited to 
the following two cases:
1. For those Member States having commercial reprocessing plants, it 
may be straightforward by adding only a conversion facility to produce 
the fuel salt with U or Pu.
2. For other Member States, construction of a new entire reprocessing 
plant would probably be needed.
Thorium fuel supply challenges
Thorium fuel supply is characterized by different types of challenges than 
HALEU or Pu. The primary ones remain the acceptance by industry, 
widespread adaptation of existing uranium-based fuel fabrication technol­
ogy for manufacturing thorium-based fuel, and the accompanying devel­
opment of the significant supporting infrastructure for the thorium-based 
technology. Furthermore, fuels that are based on uranium already have an 
infrastructure that is well established, so these fuels are a natural preference 
to the less popular thorium. For these reasons, it appears that there are sig­
nificant challenges for deploying reactor technologies that are based on 
thorium in the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, if reactor developers 
increasingly pursue a design utilizing thorium, the thorium fuel market 
will grow.
23.2.2.3 Regulatory challenges
This work recognized the existence of multiple regulatory agencies 
worldwide, and no attempt is made at evaluating their effectiveness in 
regulating any reactor technology. Also, it does not identify the challenges 
faced by any of these agencies in carrying out their individual responsibil­
ity to their respective governments, relative to licensing and permitting of 
nuclear activities involving MSRs. However, in meeting regulatory 
demands, there are unique, technology-specific challenges associated with 
licensing of MSR designs irrespective of the regulatory jurisdiction. It is 
these more generally applicable challenges from a regulatory perspective 
that are included here. It remains incumbent upon each individual appli­
cant for regulatory approval to evaluate the specific challenges for licens­
ing or permitting of an MSR within its chosen regulatory jurisdiction.

International Atomic Energy Agency 241
Providing a comprehensive listing of regulatory challenges associated with 
each of the many regulatory agencies was beyond the scope of this work.
The solution to regulatory challenges for the MSR technology may be 
different depending on each domestic market, but it is desirable to have 
criteria or guidelines that are applicable worldwide.
Acceptance of evaluation tools by regulators
The scarcity or lack of available technical information to allow developers 
to create successful designs is a challenge. Hence, providing meaningful 
and credible evidence to enable the regulator to align or develop its regu­
latory requirements according to the safety characteristics of MSRs is a 
challenge as well.
Many of the issues impeding industry interest in MSRs are in the areas 
of safety evaluation and regulatory licensing tailored to the characteristics 
of MSRs. Consequently, common safety/licensing challenges exist from 
the lack of specific safety evaluation tools and capabilities. The outstanding 
issues are, among others, lack of a consensus set of potential MSR acci­
dents, of the form and content of a regulatory license application, and of 
experimental validation or benchmarks of safety evaluation tools for 
MSRs. Moreover, the current regulatory practices caused the acceptance 
of the newly developed tools to be very expensive and time-consuming.
Evaluation of accident progression
Depending on the regulatory framework, licensing of an MSR may 
require evaluating the progression of potential accidents for MSRs. No 
comprehensive, consensus set of potential MSR accidents or safety models 
of these accidents is currently available. This lack of documented and 
credible MSR accident scenarios that result in the dispersal of significant 
quantities of radionuclides may be due, at least partly, to the good safety 
characteristics of MSRs. A robust justification of these safety characteristics 
is expected to completely or at least partially resolve this challenge.
Overall, a comprehensive set of design basis accidents (DBAs) could be 
developed for MSRs based upon their common characteristics in a similar 
way to that initially developed for light water reactors (LWRs), well 
before the latter plants had accumulated very considerable operating 
experience.
MSR technology offers great flexibility to reactor developers, so there 
are substantial design variations between prospective developers, thus 
increasing the difficulty of validating modeling tools for general purposes.

242 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
Moreover, MSRs will have substantial variability in types and vulnerabil­
ities to accidents that occur beyond the reactor system and the generation 
of electricity and possibly cogeneration. However, these accidents may 
also lack the energetic potential to disperse the radionuclides beyond the 
plant site, owing to the inherent properties of molten salts and low oper­
ating pressure of the primary system.
One means to provide assurance that a proposed list of DBAs for MSRs 
adequately spans the potential set of accidents is to employ maximum hypo­
thetical accident evaluations such as those used by the US regulator 
(US-NRC, 1995). This approach led to historic (and current non-power) 
reactor licensing that relied upon maximum hypothetical accidents to bound 
potential accidents. MSRs may be able to follow a similar strategy by show­
ing that even credible beyond DBAs, such as prompt criticality or massive 
failure of the boundary wetted by the fuel salt or both, do not result in sig­
nificant radionuclide release while crediting only barriers and passive struc­
tures, systems, and components (SSCs) for removing decay heat.
Measurements of fuel salt’s properties are required to provide data to 
determine, in subsequent testing, what radionuclides are released from the 
fuel salt under normal and accident conditions. The combination of fuel 
salt property measurements and performance models will form the foun­
dation for fuel salt qualification.
Fuel accidents can also be bounded by maximum hypothetical acci­
dents. If even prompt criticality or unintended criticality outside the core 
region of the fuel boundary does not result in release of radionuclides 
from the plant, the fuel performance specification and consequently the 
testing required to validate fuel properties may be relaxed substantially. In 
essence, even if fuel salt that is well outside design specifications is loaded 
into the reactor, the probability for radionuclide release into the environ­
ment remains very low provided that the fuel continues to be cooled; 
from this viewpoint it is worth noticing that some MSR designs provide 
this cooling by passive means. Thus, a fuel specification would be limited 
to validating the fuel salt’s thermophysical properties rather than its 
nuclear properties. MSR fuel salt thermophysical properties are not antici­
pated to substantially change even after many years of use, thereby sub­
stantially decreasing the rigor required in the measurements of these 
properties (Flanagan and Qualls, 2018). These are benefits of using a fuel 
salt that may simplify the licensing process.
Additionally, any accidents have to be evaluated that might happen 
during the entire fuel cycle and also after the used nuclear fuel has been 

International Atomic Energy Agency 243
disposed of. A regulator expects any applicants (vendors or operators) to 
support their safety case. An ultimate waste disposal plan has to be pre­
pared, and its safety reasonably demonstrated by the license applicant.
Industrial codes and standards
MSR deployment challenges exist due to a lack of industrial codes and 
standards, several of which have begun development. Examples of recom­
mended standards include:
• 
MSR Design Safety Standard. For example, one is currently under 
development in the USA as ANS 20.2 (ANS, 2022);
• 
salt composition standards;
• 
fuel salt transportation standards;
• 
standard methods for performing MSR fissile materials accounting; and
• 
standard methods for evaluating MSR vital areas related to physical 
protection.
The development of specific codes and standards is now starting in the 
US, such as ANS 20.2. However, there is a wide variety of these standards 
besides the above examples, and further development is needed.
23.2.2.4 Fuel salt waste disposal challenges
Liquid salt does not accumulate physical damage like solid fuel. Also, to 
the extent that its composition can be controlled to remain within a speci­
fication, it does not suffer from aging. Fission products can potentially 
build up to equilibrium concentrations, and most designs include some 
online or batch continual chemical processing (polishing) of the molten 
salt so the extent of this phenomenon will be dependent upon the indi­
vidual developers’ choice of fission product and fission gas management 
techniques and design choices. Consequently, used MSR fuel salt can be 
considered for use in future generations of reactors. However, further 
advances in technology development and demonstration are required for 
an MSR to operate on a closed fuel cycle (Choe et al., 2018). 
Nevertheless, MSRs still require a disposal path for fuel salt waste and 
defining this path could significantly support licensing of the MSRs.
The Office of Nuclear Energy of the US Department of Energy has 
recently provided overviews of the potential waste processing and waste 
form options for MSRs (Riley et al., 2018) and has evaluated the status of 
molten salt waste technologies focusing on fast spectrum systems (Arm 
et al., 2020). It is still required, however, that thermal spectrum reactors 

244 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
be evaluated, and that challenges in development of disposal techniques of 
different fluoride and chloride salts be solved.
The basic technology for creating stable salt waste forms is generally 
known (Siemer, 2012, 2014). However, no implementation details are 
available for the technology or licensing of waste disposal systems. A vali­
dated MSR waste stream roadmap, which would help to minimize the 
technical risks, is yet to be completed.
Some components wetted by fuel salt may have significant amounts of 
fission products plated onto and possibly embedded into their surfaces. 
Moreover, container alloys will have been activated while in use and may 
include surface contamination with actinide materials. Activation of nickel 
within the nickel-based alloys used may (depending on the shielding 
design) result in the structural alloy being classified as a radioactive waste 
and disposed of. Several Member States are working toward developing 
nuclear waste disposal strategies that, in principle, would be the same for 
MSR and LWR waste. Also, recycling of used nuclear material is 
possible.
The knowledge of the waste streams and viability of solutions to treat 
the used fuel and dispose of the waste are important aspects in developing 
and licensing MSRs. There are technical options for reusing actinides 
indefinitely and for stably packaging the remainder of the fuel salt. The 
remainder of the solid wastes can largely be left to decay sufficiently to be 
acceptable in surface storage sites.
23.2.2.5 Safeguards and security challenges
MSRs incorporate features that are fundamentally different from conven­
tional reactors. At the same time, MSRs have limited operational experi­
ence restricted to research reactors from a time preceding modern best 
practices for safeguards and security. A modern framework for safeguards 
and security for MSRs is therefore largely untested and represents impor­
tant uncertainties regarding deployment of MSRs as power reactors at 
large scale. Consequently, reactor developers have to establish, verify, and 
validate adequate safeguards and security provisions for MSRs. In parallel, 
various stakeholders—including legislators and international organiza- 
tions—will need foresight, imagination, and initiative to proactively 
accommodate an expansion of nuclear power at large scale, including 
SMRs and MSRs, as prescribed by many scenarios for reducing green­
house gas emissions (IPCC, 2018).

International Atomic Energy Agency 245
There is great variety in MSR designs, which importantly impacts 
safeguards and, to a lesser extent, security. Some MSRs circulate liquid 
fuel salts while actively controlling the chemistry of the fuel salt, which 
are features resembling facilities for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. This is 
particularly true for MSRs that incorporate online refueling and fuel salt 
let-down, as well as online separation of fission products and actinides. 
Other MSR designs do not exchange considerable amounts of radioactive 
material with other systems within the NPP, more akin to conventional 
solid fuel reactors, for which nuclear material accountancy is expected to 
be easier to implement.
Historically, safeguards and security measures were “added on” rather 
than developed concurrently with an NPP design. Despite this, the safe­
guards and security measures implemented in conventional NPPs have 
been effective. This is evident from the lack of severe incidents related to 
external attacks, sabotage, theft, or other diversions of fissile material from 
commercial NPPs. In designing and developing commercial MSRs, pro­
active consideration of and discourse about safeguards and security from 
an early design stage will ensure effective implementation of efficient 
measures that also retain overall economic competitiveness.
Even though the current legal framework for IAEA safeguards 
(Rockwood, 2013) focuses mostly on existing NPPs and processing facili­
ties, already established methods and practices are expected to be applica­
ble to MSRs to some extent, though some adaptation may be necessary. 
Nonetheless, since no MSR for power generation has been licensed for 
commercial operation in any regulatory jurisdiction to date, the imple­
mentation of necessary safeguards and security protocols remains a chal­
lenge to deployment.
Material control and accountability
Fissile material control and accountability are a key differentiating element 
of licensing risk for reactors with liquid fuel. Some Member States plan to 
adopt material accountancy equivalent to what is required currently by 
“The Structure and Content of Agreements Between the Agency and 
States Required in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons” (IAEA, 1972). A new approach, such as including 
safeguards early in the design process, can be implemented as well.
Depending on a reactor’s design, the application of safeguards to 
MSRs with liquid fuel may have to consider: (1) the mixture of fuel, 
coolant, fission products, and actinides (along with high radiation fields);

246 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
(2) variation in isotopic concentrations in the fuel salt including removal 
of fission products, rare earth elements, and noble metals; (3) high operat­
ing temperatures; (4) online processing—if included in the reactor 
design—where some fraction of the inventory of fuel salt can be removed 
while the reactor is operating; (5) unique refueling schemes—if included 
in the reactor design—including the ability to continuously feed the core 
with fresh fissile and fertile material; and (6) the presence of fuel outside 
the reactor vessel (Kovacic et al., 2018). Approaches to accomplish the 
required material control and accountancy at MSRs are still under devel­
opment, and no general consensus has been reached to date.
Nevertheless, there are already existing safeguards techniques and 
equipment, classified by the IAEA (IAEA, 2011), which could be directly 
implemented at MSR facilities, such as the weight or volume counting of 
the fuel salt within a single Material Balance Area (MBA), among other 
non-destructive analysis techniques. With only one or limited number of 
MBAs encompassing the MSR NPP, material control and accountancy 
can be achieved in a simplified manner, which would correspond to 
trends in advanced reactor design, where a simplified approach to safety 
and safeguards is preferred to costly and redundant engineered solutions. 
However, the fact that even fuels for a pebble bed reactor (PBR) could 
be seen as a bulk item versus an item when looking at reactor design and 
operation complicates the accounting for fuel moving across MBAs 
(Beddingfield and Hori, 2007). Measuring and accounting for fuel in peb­
ble and liquid or even the solid salt forms will need a change in the 
framework for verification and accountancy measures (Durst et al., 2009). 
The safeguards will have to acknowledge that liquid material changing 
isotopic form cannot be drawn off from an MSR and be accounted like 
an item. A format for setting up a limit on the material measurement 
accuracies and discrepancies such as is done with powders and liquids in 
fuel fabrication or reprocessing facilities will need formulation for MSRs 
and PBRs.
Additionally, containment and surveillance techniques, which comple­
ment measurements, do not necessarily have to be different from the 
existing ones. If safeguards are considered early in the process of designing 
an MSR, complexity of accountability processes can be significantly 
reduced. Solid fuel salt delivered to an MSR NPP prior to melting can be 
treated as fuel pellets currently used in LWRs and counted per item. 
Transport and storage accountancy will not differ, either. On the other 
hand, transport and handling of the nuclear material will increase due to 

International Atomic Energy Agency 247
rapid development and deployment of MSRs and closed nuclear fuel 
cycles, which will require infrastructure and more personnel capable of 
dealing with sensitive technology and with the noted need above for a 
more sophisticated approach to handling bulk nuclear fuels with 
acceptable uncertainties in verification activities.
Security challenges unique to molten salt reactors
Security by design, a concept included in the World Institute for Nuclear 
Security (WINS) Best Practice Guide (WINS, 2016), suggests that pre­
vention of a malicious act is always preferred to having to respond to it. 
Design and salts that are proliferation resistant, lessons learned from opera­
tion of existing NPPs, and strict access control of the MSR NPP must be 
implemented throughout the entire lifetime of an MSR NPP.
The only anticipated MSR interface with the environment that is 
related to security is in the MSR’s need to reject decay heat—which is 
the same as in conventional NPPs. The function of removing decay heat 
after reactor shutdown will likely be split into multiple passive (and active) 
systems to provide redundancy against single failures. To cause sufficient 
barrier damage to result in significant release of radionuclides into the 
environment by preventing an MSR from rejecting decay heat, an adver­
sary would, thus, need to impair these separate and independent cooling 
systems and prevent operation of the cooling systems used during normal 
operation. Furthermore, molten salts retain radionuclides to a much 
greater extent than when traditional solid fuel rods are used. Hence, 
MSRs do not appear to be particularly vulnerable to releasing radioactiv­
ity due to attacks to systems used for decay heat removal.
On the other hand, MSRs have various SSCs that are different to 
those used by the current fleet of NPPs. The SSCs that are specific 
to MSRs, such as those used for online fuel reprocessing, may be targets 
of malicious attacks. Accordingly, measures for the physical protection of 
these SSCs may have to be developed and then reviewed for regulatory 
approval. Such development and review are challenges to be addressed 
and are related to the regulatory challenges mentioned above.
Alternate physical security requirements for advanced reactor technologies 
with enhanced engineered safety and security features, such as those the 
Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) in the USA has proposed developing, are 
needed (NEI, 2016). The alternate requirements would have the key result of 
shifting the responsibility for protecting facilities from the plant owners to 
local law enforcement, substantially reducing the ongoing expense related to 

248 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
security by the plant owners. SSCs that are specific to MSRs, such as those 
used for online fuel reprocessing and the interface for transferring decay heat 
to the environment, will need to be robust against assaults so local law 
enforcement can be relied upon for their physical protection.
23.2.2.6 Maintenance and operation challenges
The MSRE, which was operated and produced energy just below 10 MW 
(th) for roughly 4 years, is a major source of knowledge on maintenance 
and operation of an MSR. There are elaborate reports on maintenance 
equipment and procedures, and accounts of successful implementation of 
totally remote and long-handled tools for maintenance of the MSRE, 
including a mock-up facility of an MSR specifically designed for testing of 
remote handling technology for major component replacement (Briggs, 
1964; Blumberg and Hise, 1968). Remote maintenance is required due to 
the high temperature and radioactivity of the fuel. Harsh conditions inside 
an MSR facility can damage the remote-handling equipment, which adds 
another complexity level to the maintenance and operation, as service of 
the irradiated equipment might be needed as well.
Moreover, the operational challenges in decontamination and cleanup 
of spillages of active salts may be addressed by the Member States. Also, 
should any in-core structures and components be replaced, either due to a 
break or their end-of-life caused by irradiation, specific maintenance 
actions are required. Measures used in conventional NPPs can be adopted 
in MSRs to some extent, but more advanced and remote solutions might 
be needed, depending on the strategy for dealing with the decontamina­
tion and replacement.
Improved modeling tools for process operations would be of substan­
tial use to facilitate scale-up and modeling of MSR operation for 
extended duration. Extensive, automated, and remote maintenance and 
component replacement may be required for a commercial plant. 
Developing and demonstrating this maintenance and replacement, as well 
as adequate modeling and simulation of maintenance and operation pro­
cesses are key elements and challenges to deploying MSR designs. Both 
the maintenance and operation of an MSR could be significantly simpli­
fied with the use of modern technology, such as virtual reality, where a 
digital twin of a facility could be used for training and planning of the 
activities. However, challenges that may be faced during maintenance and 
replacement of the remote handling equipment will require solutions that 
might not yet be commercially viable.

International Atomic Energy Agency 249
23.2.2.7 Program documentation challenges
The MSRE was viewed as a very successful test reactor and the overall 
MSR program of the USA was a development program that extended 
over decades, which would suggest that no major technology develop­
ment is needed in order to commercialize the first MSR NPPs. However, 
this understanding is not widespread and the technology status and the 
unique features and benefits of MSRs are not well known beyond the 
people who have been involved in various MSR development programs.
For example, corrosion of pipes and other components in contact with 
salts has been extensively researched and documented. Few people outside 
of a very narrow specialist community, including regulatory agencies, 
understand that, as early as in 1967, the ORNL concluded that the tech­
nology for materials resistant to corrosion was in an advanced stage of 
development (Thoma, 1971). ORNL came to this conclusion based on 
an extensive corrosion program, using several families of fluoride mixtures 
involving commercial and high temperature alloys that were under devel­
opment at that time. These same studies also concluded that container 
materials were available that demonstrated extremely low corrosion rates 
at temperatures expected to be encountered during anticipated MSR 
operations (McCoy and Weir, 1967).
Through the 1970s, salt chemistry control was further developed, sub­
stantially decreasing the significance of corrosion as a limitation to MSR 
deployment. Also, multiple companies are currently carrying out their 
own corrosion experiments.
Irrespective of these examples of research and development results, 
which have been available for several decades, there remains a lack of 
general familiarity with the technology status of MSR developments and 
the unique features and benefits of MSRs. Developing program docu­
mentation of high quality that is readily accessible to the non-specialist 
technical community is more important to MSR development than for 
other advanced reactor classes.
23.3 Activities on the safety of molten salt reactors
The IAEA safety standards applicable to NPPs were mainly developed at a 
time when land-based, large, LWRs produced electricity at commercial 
level. Recently, there has been substantial interest in other reactor tech­
nologies. To respond to this need, the IAEA started a project in 2020 on 
reviewing the applicability of IAEA safety standards to reactors that may 

250 Global Progress on Molten Salt Reactors
not be fully covered by IAEA safety standards, including MSRs. As 
part of this project, a group of experts on MSR safety was convened 
by the IAEA to assess the applicability of the IAEA’s Safety Specific 
Requirements No. SSR-2/1 (Rev. 1) (IAEA, 2016) to MSRs. Reports 
documenting this review and the overall results of this project are 
expected to be publicly available in 2022.
In addition, Subsections 23.2.2.3 and 23.2.2.5 describe regulatory, and 
safeguards and security challenges, respectively.
23.4 Other related activities
As mentioned in Section 23.2, one appendix of IAEA (2021a) describes 
some current MSR concepts, including those that may still be at a con­
ceptual level. Practically all current MSR developers were contacted, 
and each was requested to provide a brief summary of its concept. The 
mentioned appendix presents the summaries of the concepts that were 
received.
A more detailed description of MSR concepts can be found in the 
online IAEA’s database Advanced Reactor Information System (ARIS) (if 
the developer of the concept provided such description to this database) 
(IAEA, 2022). This database is updated periodically. The recent IAEA 
publication “Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology 
Developments (2020 Edition)” (IAEA, 2020) is a supplement to ARIS 
and has a section with 10 MSRs that are SMRs. This report is usually 
published every 2 years.
In addition, the IAEA has explored during approximately the last two 
decades the possibility of including thorium as fuel in nuclear reactors, and 
the associated processes, such as the thorium fuel cycle. IAEA (2000, 2002, 
2003, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2021b) provide information 
about the work related to thorium fuel cycle. Subsection 23.2.2.2.3 specifi­
cally addresses challenges with the thorium fuel supply.
