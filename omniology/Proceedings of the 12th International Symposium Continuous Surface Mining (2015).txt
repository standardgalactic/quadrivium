Welcome to the ISCSM 2014
Despite the fact that continuous mining systems are operated in all ﬁve continents
and in unconsolidated as well as consolidated material, the technique is still associ-
ated with lignite mining in Central Europe. The ﬁrst International Symposium was,
however, held in Edmonton, Canada in 1986 at a time when continuous systems
marked the ﬁrst steps of the fast expanding oil sand mining. With the expansion of
elements of continuous systems into hard rock mines the development of the tech-
nique now can be found in all kind of mines.
The scope of the ISCSM is to reference the state of the art as well as inform about
research results and trends in continuous surface mining. It is jointly organized by
Aachen University and Bergakademie Freiberg and in partnership with DEBRIV.
The event takes place every three years alternating between the two universities and
international locations. The ISCSM 2014 Call for Papers attracted more than 65
abstracts from 15 countries.
The papers that have been accepted will be published in hard cover by the pub-
lishing house Springer in the “Lecture Notes in Production Engineering”-Series as
part of the conference package. This is an innovation insofar as the selection and
evaluation of papers is now done in a standardized peer review process. The sympo-
sium committee apologies for the burden imposed by the online conference system
OCS especially on the authors from outside the academic structures. In engineering
evaluation of conference papers and publications in journals traditionally takes place
by praxis rather than in academic circles. The symposium committee, however, felt
obliged to comply with the urge of university management worldwide towards the
peer reviewed system - common in natural science.
After the opening session the symposium continues in three parallel ones grouped
into seven issues to allow the audience to focus on distinct topics. Apart from the
traditional mining in unconsolidated material (1), drilling, dewatering, slope sta-
bility and soil mechanics (2), deposit and mine simulation in computerized mine
planning (3), control of operations, organization and management (4) as well as en-
vironmental questions (5) and the now established praxis in consolidated material
for example IPCC (6) will be dealt with. An individual session has been added to
address legislation and mine administration (7).

Welcome to the ISCSM 2014
Regardless the effort to comply with university standards, the symposium apart
from scientiﬁc research speciﬁcally focuses on the state of the art in the industry.
Here, the event will present ample opportunities for discussions with national and
international professionals and features a poster presentation. The ﬁeld trip to the
famous Hambach Mine will give an insight into the state of the art in mining tech-
nology and consideration of environmental aspects in the Rhenish lignite district.
At this point, I would like to thank all speakers, companies, institutions and sup-
porters contributing to the success of the conference. This foremost goes to DEBRIV
for its active partnership in the preparation of the upcoming event.
We hope that you will be able to join us at the Symposium and look forward to
extending a warm welcome to all delegates and afﬁliates.

Conti® MegaPipe – A New Dimension  
in Closed-Trough Belt Technology 
Thomas Neumann and Andrey Minkin 
ContiTech Transportbandsysteme GmbH, 
PO Box 1169,  
37154 Northeim, Germany 
ContiTech is adding a new dimension to closed-trough belt technology. Enlarging 
the maximum diameter of the closed-trough belt to max. 900 mm will 
considerably expand the number of uses to which it can be put. It will give rise to 
completely new application areas for the transport of bulk material. Considerable 
reductions in fixed costs and CO2 emissions are possible, particularly for solid 
rock digging in surface mining. For all other industrial applications, this 
innovation will double the volumetric flow rate!   
1 
Challenges Facing Closed-Trough Belt Technology 
Is it possible to transport large volumetric flow rates over complicated routes 
without generating high noise levels? Can the transported material be protected, at 
the same time, from environmental influences such as rain and wind? Is steep 
conveyance possible? Can all of this be done, even under extreme environmental 
conditions such as very low temperatures? 
These, and many other questions from our customers, encouraged us to 
investigate the current state of closed-trough belt technology and compare this 
with current opportunities. In doing so, we drew on a rich collection of closed-
trough belts that have already been delivered. Under the name "HS-Rollgurt," 
Conti closed-trough belts have become a technological standard in a large number 
of industrial sectors. 
But time presses on, yet the further development of drive technology makes 
progress possible, particularly in light of EU environmental legislation grounded 
in the new requirements to lower CO2 emissions.   
The technical pre-requisites, timing resources, and naturally the motivation of 
excellently trained application engineers and developers form the basis for 
successful implementation of the idea.  
1.1 
High Inclined Angles and Small Curve Radii 
Closed-trough belts generally allow the curve to be designed in many different 
ways. They can thus be made to fit in very well with existing natural or even 

2 
T. Neumann and A. Minkin
 
urban profiles. The low noise levels and the fact that the transported material is 
enclosed frequently make the closed-trough belt a good choice. 
Steep conveyance is a special form of flow guidance. A large number of special 
steep conveyor belt solutions as well as vertical conveyor belts are currently in 
use. This means that inclines of up to 20° can be easily handled using standard 
troughed belt systems. Depending on the characteristics of the bulk materials, 
inclines of up to 35° can be created using closed-trough belts.  
A particular challenge in the area of steep conveyance arises in solid rock 
digging. Nowadays, heavy-duty trucks are mainly used here; these transport the 
material from the surface mine at an incline of up to 7°. In addition to enormous 
energy consumption, other characteristics of this mode of transport are high 
operating costs, high expenditures for servicing and a very high demand for 
qualified personnel. Many mines are located in inaccessible areas where labor is 
scant. The attractiveness of such projects is thus also very low. 
Mining companies are showing increasing interest in finding alternative means 
of transporting ore or rubble. By switching over from discontinuous conveyor 
technology to continuous conveyor belt technology, it is possible to achieve 
considerable gains in efficiency, an improvement in the CO2 footprint, and 
improved process reliability. 
Software tools are very helpful in convincing people to switch over. They take 
actual data compiled on the current mine conditions and compare conveyor 
technologies. This allows for comparison of CO2 footprints as well as investment 
and operating costs. This then provide an excellent basis for making a decision.

High Mass Flows 
How to increase efficiency poses a constant challenge for all customers. Closed-
trough belts allow a considerable improvement here thanks to their high speed,

optimum routability and expanded conveyor diameters. Conti engineers have an 
excellent pool of knowledge at their disposal that enables them to superbly adjust 
the belts to be delivered to meet customer requirements. This is where we use our 
extremely extensive wealth of experience, combined with modern calculation 
procedures and technological expertise, to achieve optimum results. 
High mass flows pose new requirements for the transmission of higher tractive 
forces, optimization of the forming forces, and belt designs. 
1.3 
FEM and DEM Method for Designing a Closed-trough Belt 
Designing closed-trough belts is a time-consuming process. Numerous factors 
have to be taken into consideration. This is why specific calculation programs 
developed by Conti engineers for this very purpose as well as other known 
software are used for DEM and FEM analysis. Test samples are then created to 
check the calculation results on special test stands in the technical center. The 
result is an optimally designed closed-trough belt that exactly meets the 
requirements of the individual project.  
2 
Expanding the Technical Opportunities with Conti® 
MegaPipe Technology 
In developing the Conti® MegaPipe, the ContiTech Conveyor Belt Group has 
opened up a whole new dimension in closed-trough belting. Figure 2 shows the 
structure of a MegaPipe with one textile tensile member and one steel cord tensile 
member. The rigidity of the MegaPipe in a transverse direction and the shape of 
the overlapping area play a decisive role in ensuring that the pipe functions safely 
and reliably. As is the case with conventional closed-trough belts, the belt must be 
designed in such a way as to ensure optimum transverse rigidity.  
If this is not the case, the belt edges of the overlapping area can crumble (transverse 
rigidity is too low) or the system's energy consumption will be too (in some cases, the 
closed-trough belt risks opening up between idler roller stations). The shape of the 
overlapping area must securely seal the material in the closed-trough belt. 
As shown in Figure 2, optimum transverse rigidity of a steel cord MegaPipe is 
achieved by means of a system consisting of several textile and steel breakers that 
have been attached at a particular distance from the neutral phase (this is frequently 
the central level of the cord) in the cross-section of a closed-trough belt. In the case 
of textile EP MegaPipes, optimum transverse rigidity is ensured by maintaining a 
particular distance between textile EP layers and by the layout of a steel breaker.

2.1 
Increasing the Volumetric Flow Rate  
Whereas conventional models do not exceed an outer diameter of 700 mm, the 
Conti®MegaPipe can have an outer diameter of as much as 900 mm. The larger 
diameter offers two distinct advantages. Firstly, the larger belt width of up to 3,200 
mm and the higher conveyor speed enable a significant increase in the capacity of the 
conveyor system. This allows for an increase in the flow rate of up to 100 percent. 
2.2 
Increased Grain Size  
The 
Conti®MegaPipe 
can 
transport 
coarse-grained 
material. 
The 
Conti®MegaPipe can handle material with a grain size up to 30 percent larger 
than what conventional systems can deal with. This facilitates transportation of 
large chunks of material with a grain size of up to 350 mm. This makes it possible 
to use the Conti®MegaPipe directly after a primary crusher.  
2.3 
Adapting to the Profile of the Surface Mine  
Solid rock digging, in particular, involves a very steep angle of approach. For this 
reason, the use of continuous conveyor devices has only been possible so far with 
considerable additional investments. It is then necessary to create intricate 
approach sections if belt systems are used whose conveying angle is limited by the 

Conti® MegaPipe – A New Dimension in Closed-Trough Belt Technology

bulk material being transported. The Conti®MegaPipe can be adapted exactly to 
the existing route profile.  
2.4 
Long-Distance Transport  
Conti®MegaPipe closed-trough belts are also suitable for very long transport 
routes. The absence of transfer points, and the enormous adaptability offer an 
interesting alternative here to discontinuous transport involving heavy-duty trucks 
or even rail transport. In the latter case, neither the time-consuming loading and 
unloading processes nor the complete technical and HR infrastructure for rail 
transport are required.  
This mode of transport offers optimum protection to the transported material. 
And quantity losses are minimal. 
2.5 
Flow Rates within Companies 
The opportunity to realize 3D routes makes the use of closed-trough belts within 
companies very interesting. Conti®MegaPipe expands the range of uses here in 
relation to volumetric flow rates. Loss of material at transfer points and scrapers is 
now a thing of the past.

The belt features a very compact design. This makes it ideal for use in 
underground mining and tunnel construction. 
The absence of transfer points considerably cuts costs. Even the material losses, 
which are difficult to avoid here, and the HR outlay for manual removal of 
contamination on the transport route are a thing of the past. 
Thanks to standardized and low-wear components, the servicing and cleaning 
outlay is greatly reduced. 
Thanks to the closed-trough belt concept, very steep conveyor angles of up to 
35° are possible. 
Conti closed-trough belts can be designed for high conveyor speeds. 
3.2 
Product 
High conveyor strengths make large distances between axes possible, even in the 
case of larger diameters and inclines. 
The short clamping distances result from the low-stretch reinforcements. 
High straight-line stability, and optimum sealing of the overlapping zone are 
hallmark features of Conti®MegaPipe closed-trough belts. A high level of 
experience and accuracy in designing tensile members and belt material is 
required to achieve this very characteristic. This characteristic is particularly 
important in the event of adverse external circumstances. 
Thanks to the company's decades of experience, and the extreme reliability of 
the belt design, a long service life is guaranteed. 
The particular dimensions and characteristics of the Conti®MegaPipe allow the 
DIRECT transport of broken ore away from the PRIMARY CRUSHER. This 
means that transportation by heavy-duty truck can be minimized. 
3.3 
Protecting the Environment and the Transported Material 
Conti® MegaPipe technology also makes it possible to dispense with 
discontinuous material transport by means of heavy-duty trucks. This considerably 
reduces energy consumption , resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 
emissions. ContiTech supports customers in implementing this universal goal. 
This contributes toward implementation of the ContiTech "Green Engineering" 
key principle. 
Closed-trough belts protect both the environment and operatives from 
dangerous, contaminated, dusty, and malodorous materials (such as chemicals, 
waste, ash, rubble, etc.). What is more, the material transported is not 
contaminated by outside influences. 
Instead, it is protected from environmental influences such as wind, snow, and 
rain.

Conti® MegaPipe in Solid Rock Digging 
The feasibility study focuses on an existing solid rock mine. The role of the 
closed-trough belt is to transport the metal ore from the bottom of the mine to the 
upper level. Heavy-duty trucks are used only for haulage from the extraction 
equipment to the central loading point of the Conti® MegaPipe with primary 
crusher.

4.3.2 Heavy-Duty Truck – Consumption Calculation 
- 
Power class of the heavy-duty truck: 200 t  
- 
Cycles per hour: 2 
- 
Required number of heavy-duty trucks: 10 
-

- 
Total diesel consumption of the heavy-duty truck fleet: 4,000 l/h 
- 
Total energy consumption of the heavy-duty truck fleet: 19,600 kWh 
This rough examination shows a considerable potential for reducing energy 
consumption and CO2 emissions. The belt system consumes less than half 
as much transport energy as heavy-duty truck transport. 
This does not take into account further cost reductions arising from reduced 
operating, HR, and servicing expense as well as profits from higher process 
reliability, etc.. 
4.4 
Cost Advantage Resulting from Doing without a Secondary 
Crusher Thanks to a Conti® MegaPipe 
There is a limit to the grain diameter size in the case of closed-trough belts. In 
general, the internal closed-trough belt diameter must be twice or three times the 
max. material grain size in order to cope with this material. In standard closed-
trough belts, a secondary crusher is therefore required immediately after the 
primary crusher. It reduces the grain size and thus make the material 
"transportable" for a closed-trough belt (see Figure 3). 
A simple cost-effectiveness calculation shows the following: wearing parts 
must be replaced 14 times a year or even more often. If the costs for wearing parts 
over a 25-year period (the usual service life of a secondary crusher) are added to 
its cost of purchase, it becomes obvious that using a Conti®MegaPipe and the 
associated elimination of the secondary crushers can mean that getting around the 
cost of an eight-figure investment! 
Even if use of a secondary crusher is unavoidable in the technological chain, a 
MegaPipe allows it to be used flexibly, i.e. the secondary crusher can be installed 
after both the primary crusher as well as the MegaPipe discharge point. This 
means that a mine operator has more latitude in the positioning of a secondary 
crusher in the technology chain.

Summary 
Closed-trough belts are a reliable technology for continuous conveyor technology. 
The advantages they offer come into play in very demanding tasks in particular. 
Conti®MegaPipes expand the range of application possibilities considerably. 
They open up an entirely new dimension in conveyor technology for mining .  
The Conti®MegaPipe combines the well-known advantages of a closed-trough 
belt -- such as environmentally compatibility, enclosed transport of materials, 
small curve radii, high incline angles of up to 35°, elimination of transfer points -- 
with new characteristics such as the possibility of material grain sizes of up to 350 
mm, high conveyor speeds, and high mass flows.   
This presentation outlines how continuous closed-trough belt technology is 
used in solid rock mining. It has considerable potential to reduce energy 
consumption, and CO2 emissions, with a resulting reduction in the cost of 
transporting ore and rubble from the mine. 
Thanks to the possible omission of a secondary crusher, eight-figure 
investments can be avoided. In addition, a mine operator has more latitude with 
regard to the positioning of a secondary crusher in the technology chain. 
This technology is also an interesting solution for large flow rates over 
complicated routes and relatively long distances.

Belt Positioning and Skewing Prevention

Abstract. In open pit mines, one of the key aspects of automation is the transport 
of the mined minerals. Due to their economic benefit, conveyor belts are used to 
transport masses continuously.  High availabilities and safe working conditions 
can be achieved by automating the process. Especially the feeding of the conveyor 
system has a strong automation potential. At the moment, the positioning of 
transfer booms or transfer chutes is done manually by a machine operator. The 
decisions of the operator are driven by his experience and his visual perception. 
The visual perception is often limited, e.g. by low light (in the evenings or at 
night), blinding by the sun or other environmental conditions such as dust or rain 
which can be present in open pit mining. This can lead to sub-optimal loading of 
the material. In case of off-centered loading, the conveyor belt can start to drift 
away from a centered position, which is called skewing. This skewing results in 
increased wear and tear of the system leading to breakdowns or increased 
maintenance times. Additionally, the transport capacity of the conveyor belt 
decreases because less area can be loaded with material.  
To detect skewing on conveyor belts, various systems are available on the 
market. The most common types of detection systems are mechanical components 
like switches and guide roller constructions. A second group of sensors used for 
skewing detection are supersonic systems. Both, mechanical and supersonic 
systems are not able to prevent belt skewing. These systems only detect an 
existing misalignment.  
To be able to prevent belt misalignments, a system based on long-wavelength 
infrared (LWIR) cameras which monitor the loading process as well as the 
position of the conveyor belt is proposed by the authors. The obtained data is 
correlated and analyzed with regard to the position of the belt when entering the 
loading station, the loading process itself and the belt position when leaving the 
station. This data can either be used for automation or if visualized to the operator, 
as an assistance system. This information can be used to optimize the loading 
process in order to prevent skewing, or to counteract already existing drift of the 
conveyor belt to prevent damages on the conveyor belt or other systems.

During production, the hopper car is moved depending on the loading unit’s 
position. Moving the hopper car is necessary if the maximal charging range is 
reached. Changes in the feeder position have to be corrected in order to prevent 
misalignments. 
Besides the positioning of the boom which is done by the loading unit driver, 
there are a number of material parameters influencing misalignments on the 
conveyor belt. Changes in density and different rebound properties at the impact 
plate as well as water content of the material can considerably influence the 
position of the belt [Seeliger 2002]. 
To detect misalignments during production various systems were developed. 
These systems will be introduced in the following. 
2 
Existing Systems for Skewing Detection/Prevention 
Systems for skewing detection can be divided into the following groups: 
• 
Mechanical systems 
• 
Ultrasonic systems 
• 
Optical systems 
Mechanical systems cover by far the biggest group of detection systems. 
Devices used for skewing detection are mechanical switches which are mounted 
next to the belt. In case of a misalignment the switch is pulled. Modern systems 
have got two phases. In the first phase of misalignment an alert is triggered, but 
the belt is still running. If the misalignment increases the mechanical system stops 
the belt to prevent it from damage and turning over. Another belt tracking method 
is the employment of rollers. These rollers are installed in recurring distances to 
guide the belt and prevent it from escaping the slide way. Using guide rollers 
causes stress and, therefore, higher tear at the belt edges. However, this measure 
does prevent misalignment. 
A tracking roller is a common item to redirect the belt passively. If the belt 
misaligns, the roller turns in the running direction guiding the belt back to the 
center. This is manly influenced by the weight of belt and material as well as the 
friction between belt and tracking roller. This roller is usually installed right 
before driving- and return station of the conveyor to ensure a straight turn and 
prevent the belt from being damaged during the turning process. From this 
follows, that misalignment caused by feeding is not compensated. 
Ultrasonic systems are used to determine the belt’s position by detecting the 
distance between sensor and belt edge. The results of this measurement can be 
influenced negatively, due to poor sensor positioning. Furthermore, a damage of 
the belt edges leads to mistakes. Damaged edges are not reflecting the ultrasonic 
waves to the sensor, but scatter and dampen them. Therefore, no signals are 
detected and false information is generated. 
Optical systems comprise the last group of belt tracking systems. Due to 
modern camera and video processing technologies, belt misalignment can be

detected with ease. Unfortunately, optical cameras are strongly influenced by 
environmental conditions. Especially dust, rain and poor light conditions can 
cause false results or make it impossible to measure the belt track.

Principles of Infrared Thermography 
Infrared radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum located between the 
visual light and microwave/radio radiation with a wavelength between 0.78 and 
1000 µm (see Figure 4). All bodies with a temperature above absolute zero (0 K or 
-273.15°C) emit electromagnetic radiation due to molecular movements. The 
wavelength of this emitted radiation is dependent on the temperature of the object 
and shortens the higher the temperature of the object gets. For ambient 
temperatures, the maximum of this emitted radiation is located inside the long-
wavelength infrared (LWIR or LIR) spectrum between 8 and 12 µm while for 
higher temperatures, the spectral emission shifts towards the visual light, 
according to Wien’s displacement law. [Schuster 2009] The radiation is detected 
by infrared-sensitive sensor arrays and visualized in images, similar to digital 
cameras. Therefore, detection of this radiation is also referred to as thermography 
or thermal imaging since it (mainly) mirrors the temperature of observed objects. 
The images contain information of relative temperature differences, with the 
coldest part of the image shown in black while the hottest point inside the image is 
white. [Nienhaus 2010] 
 
Fig. 4 Allocation of infrared radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum 
Compared to visual light detection in digital cameras, the main advantage of 
thermal imaging is the robustness towards environmental influences such as bright 
light and small particles in the surrounding atmosphere (like dust or water 
particles). Small particles are penetrated by long-wavelength infrared radiation 
and are thereby no source of influence for the resulting image. The advantages of 
infrared imaging can be seen in Figure 5. This figure shows the sight of a visual

Application of Thermal Cameras for Skewing Detection 
and Prevention 
In order to overcome the difficulties of current applications for belt skewing 
detection, imaging systems can be used to obtain a view of the position of the belt. 
By detecting the position of material on the belt and the position of the belt in 
comparison to the frame of the conveyor system, skewing can be detected and, 
hence, prevented. While observing the loading process, misalignment during the 
loading can be detected as well. As already stated, the main disadvantage of visual 
cameras is the vulnerability to all environmental influences present in an open pit 
mine. Therefore, infrared cameras were chosen for the given task.  
The positions of the installed infrared cameras were chosen to cover the three 
relevant steps of the process: the incoming belt position, the position of loading 
and the outgoing belt (see Fig. 6). The incoming belt is observed to detect 
potential misalignment already present before loading, while the other two 
cameras are used to monitor the loading process and its influence on the belt 
position.  
 
Fig. 6 Position of the thermal cameras on the hopper car 
With the aim of preventing belt skewing, the images are processed in order to 
find relevant features capable of describing and analyzing the loading process. 
Following, two example pictures of the infrared cameras are depicted after 
algorithms were applied. Additionally, a short description of the used algorithms 
and key points inside the images are given.

are insensitive to the environmental influences. This makes infrared imaging 
superior to imaging with visual light cameras. Additionally, one of the main 
disadvantages of ultrasound sensors, the influence of wear on the belt edges is not 
only irrelevant for the detection of belt skewing with infrared, but can also be 
detected. This could be used for improved maintenance schedules to reduce the 
risk of major belt damages. 
Next steps during this project include the determination of the influence of 
different material characteristics on the applied force onto the belt and the related 
belt skewing. Currently, only the positioning of the loaded material is considered 
for the determination of a misalignment in loading. However, different particle 
sizes of the material will result in different impulses on the belt and, therefore, 
influence the position of the belt in different ways. Also the type and consistency 
of material can lead to differences in belt skewing, e.g. rain will fluidize the 
material while frost will lead to bigger particles and harder material. During this 
test phase, only a small subset of possible material constellations was present and 
could be analyzed. Thereby, there might be a huge potential for further 
improvements when material changes due to the influence of seasons and weather. 
The robustness in imaging with infrared technology shows a high potential for 
other applications in open pit mines. The thermal detection can be used for 
surveillance of the condition of support segments of the conveyors as it is possible 
to detect blocked segments which will heat due to increased friction. Assistance 
systems for the personnel can be installed for supervision and replace visual light 
cameras. Because of all its advantages, it is to be expected that infrared cameras 
will be the state-of-the-art imaging tool in the future for the mining industry.

Introduction 
Nowadays every company should compete with other players on the market in 
terms of efficiency, quality of products, production cost etc. Any troubles (break-
downs) with often complicated, unique machinery systems used in the company is 
very undesirable due to financial loses as well as safety of the staff and environ-
mental issues. It was reported by Babiarz and Dudek [1] that due to unexpected 
breakdowns several heavy duty machines in Polish opencast lignite mining was 
destroyed completely and other required significant investment to rehabilitate ma-
chine or used mechanical systems. Similar problem might be find in underground 
mining (hard coal, copper). What kind of reasons have been occurred in men-
tioned cases? The most spectacular have been related to basic machines in lignite 
mine industry as bucket wheel excavator (planetary gearbox failure – several 

22

month of production breakdown, BWE boom failure, burning of machine due to 
belt ignition, etc). 
In this paper we would like to be focused on belt conveyors in both opencast 
and underground mines. Critical problems for this mechanical system are related 
to belt (longitudinal intersection, joint failure), pulleys (damages of coating, bear-
ings, shaft) and other element of drive units (damages of electric motor, coupling, 
gearbox). Due to mechanical contact of pulley’ coating and belt, it has sometimes 
happen that temperature is increasing and belt ignition might initiate. This is very 
dramatic situation for underground mines and usually results in serious conse-
quences in terms of organization of production in the mine, investigation by local 
mining authority, financial losses for mine and managers, unfortunately it might 
me also affect safety of mining staff. 
Any failure of the machines in the mine might be very difficult to repair due to 
sparse parts and experienced staff availability, environmental factors etc. To avoid 
such situations, to maintain effectively machines and to manage of maintenance 
process, many project have been launched in last decade in Polish mining indus-
try. The purpose of this paper is to list and review them as well as to synthesize 
current effort to project what would be important in the near future in Poland. 
A current state of the research and practices focused on maintenance of belt 
conveyors will be discussed, in particular, among others, following projects will 
be overviewed: i) Online monitoring system for drive units developed for lignite 
mine(2010), ii) Portable monitoring system for conveyor belt with steel cords de-
veloped for lignite mine(2013), iii), Diag Manager – maintenance system for belt 
conveyor transport network (2011 and 2013), iv) Laboratory and in situ research 
on belt conveyor technology (belts, joints, idlers resistance to motion, energy effi-
ciency, etc). Mentioned industrial project have been deployed by research teams 
from Wroclaw University of Technology, to provide whole picture regarding situ-
ation in Poland, other important implementation in both opencast and underground 
mining companies in Poland will be recalled as well.

Belt Conveyor and Belt Conveyor System 
To realize how important problem is discussed in the paper a brief description of 
conveyor and example of conveyor based transportation system in the mine will 
be presented. Fig 1a presents simplified diagram of a belt conveyor, which con-
sists of: a drive unit(s), a belt loop, idlers and some auxiliary elements. From the 
very first view it doesn’t look so complicated. However, the problem with main-
tenance of belts, drive units, idlers etc is related to specificity of mining industry. 
Today over 500 km of conveyor belts are installed in 4 lignite surface mines in 
Poland, even more conveyor belts are installed in underground mines. In this pa-
per research is focused on belts and drive units. Different loading, harsh environ-
mental conditions, large dimensions and weight of conveyor components, high 
power required to transport materials etc require innovative approaches for belt 
conveyor maintenance management. It is important to notice, that elements of

conveyor-based system are located on large area of mine (so called spatially dis-
tributed system) that requires also specific logistic procedures (Fig2). Taking into 
account all these factors and different detailed problems of given conveyor com-
ponent, dedicated systems have to be developed, and finally information from 
them should be integrated to make a decision on maintenance action.

Belt Conveyor Laboratory 
Transportation system in the mine is a key component in production chain in the 
mine. There is very undesired by the miners to do any “passive” experiments that 
might affect production efficiency. Any “active” experiments (introducing dam-
age) to test efficiency of monitoring system are not possible due to financial, or-
ganizational and safety reasons. In such a case the only possible solution is to play 
with test rig. Such a conveyor for testing was built several years ago in our labora-
tory to test diagnostic systems. The belt is 17m length, 40 cm width, conveyor is 

24

equipped with speed control system, unfortunately, there is no load applied to the 
conveyor (no material stream). It should be highlighted that it cannot replace final 
test in situ, however it significantly decreased cost of testing belt diagnostic sys-
tems, vibration monitoring system, infrared thermography based diagnostic proce-
dures. Other equipments to identify parameters of belts or their joints have been 
described in [2]

Monitoring and Diagnostic Systems for Belt Conveyor  
In this chapter following subsections will discuss: i) Online monitoring system for 
drive units developed for lignite mine (2010), ii) Portable monitoring system for 
conveyor belt with steel cords developed for lignite mine (2013), iii), Diag Man-
ager – maintenance system for belt conveyor transport network developed for  
underground copper ore mine (2011 and 2013). Again, number of element, their 
different importance in the system, motivates us to develop different solution: 
portable diagnostic system that has to be installed for each measurement and de-
installed after that and online, stationary system. Reasonable decision making 
should be based on many factors, including average lifetime, loading condition, 
damage type, importance of monitored component in whole chain and finally cost 
of single stationary monitoring system 
4.1 
Diagnostic System for Conveyor Belts 
A key difference between condition evaluation of belts and other object is that 
length of the belt could reach several kilometers and the belt is moving with speed 
equals approx. several m/s. Moreover, number, size and density (along belt length 
and width) of damage could be very different and non-uniformly distributed. It is 
due to the fact that belt’ loop consists of sections with different length. So in other 
words there is no other option for using automatic monitoring and diagnostic sys-
tem. However, specific practices in belt operation requires dedicated solution that 
need to be implemented in the system (“beginning” of the loop, differentiation be-
tween damage and joint, influence of belt speed, etc.). All these issues have been 
taken into account in system presented in Fig 4 – hardware and software part are 
presented, respectively [3, 4].

Trends in Monitoring and Diagnostic Systems for Belt 
Conveyor 
Development of sensor and measurement technologies as well as data transmis-
sion and processing techniques make possible to apply very advanced, multichan-
nel monitoring systems for maintenance purposes. Moreover, apart from  
measurement, it is often require to combine knowledge from measurements with 
knowledge about failure analysis, human factors influence, environmental impact 
and so on. All these information are nowadays available in modern corporations in 
various data bases and information systems. In authors belief, the future of main-
tenance management will be based on data/information and knowledge fusion. 
Problem of mining machines is that they operates in very harsh conditions, and 
problem of maintenance seems to be very complicated [8]. It is due to number of 
factors that should be taken into account. Additional problem that was recently 
deeply studied by Bartelmus is influence of varying operating condition [9] and 
unique degradation scenarios [10] in mining industry. This problem is partially re-
lated to data fusion concept suggested by Galar [11], because apart from current 
diagnostic features values, knowledge about operational condition should be taken 
into account Also history of operation (number of startup and shut down events, 
repair action etc.) might significantly modify results of condition assessment and 
prognosis. Research team lead by Barszcz [12] pointed out that due to harsh con-
ditions, complexity of machines and influence of external factors, data collecting 
by automatic systems should be carefully interpreted and validated. It appears that 
many data acquired by condition monitoring systems doesn’t contain any diagnos-
tic information due to, for example, damaged sensor. Finally, the last key issue 
and in fact serious challenge for diagnostic is problem of decision making based 
on collected data. Decision scheme commonly used in monitoring system follow 
the “if then else” rule, that basically mean constant thresholds for warning or 
alarm [13-15]. It has been proved among others by Bartelmus [9] that in machines 
operated in time varying conditions values of thresholds should be load dependent 
and might be linear or nonlinear function of load. Mentioned challenges (feature-

operating condition dependencies, validation, load dependent threshold, data fu-
sion) seems to be universal problems both for rotating machines as well as belts 
condition monitoring. It should be noticed that there are other commercial solu-
tions that also are used in mining companies ([16-18]) as well as other research in-
stitutes. As far as we know, at least in systems operated in mining companies, 
mentioned problems were not solved in systematic way. Thresholds are “adapted” 
according to engineering experience (what if machine is unique?), data fusion is 
not performed, varying load is not taken into account. A final conclusion could be 
formulated in optimistic manner: there is a lot of work to do with monitoring and 
diagnostic in mining industry from research perspective and fortunately, there  
are more and more mining companies that want to invest money in Condition  
Monitoring.

Conclusion 
In the paper a review of last developments of condition based maintenance solu-
tions dedicated to belt conveyors is presented. They have been prepared by mem-
bers of Machinery Systems Division and prototypes were installed in opencast and 
underground mine. A brief description of basic functions implemented in these 
system is provided in appropriate sections. Finally, several challenges for future 
work are pointed out. They seem to be complicated task and according to authors 
knowledge many research teams work on them. Finally in the paper we point out 
several challenges that come out from many years of experience with mining ma-
chines, monitoring and diagnostics. Unfortunately they seem to be  classical ones: 
experimental data validation, data processing, modeling, analysis, decision mak-
ing, information processing and visualization.

Abstract. In the paper a new diagnostic approach for gearbox used in belt con-
veyors will be discussed. The purpose of the work is to provide novel view on di-
agnostic data processing in the context of detection of changes in condition for 
population of gearboxes used in belt conveyor network. The idea will be presented 
by examples: a data base of diagnostic features collected during last 3 years (real 
data from conveyors operating in mining company) will be used for illustration.  
The method takes advantage from recent results of research carried out by au-
thors and other researchers related to different types of gearboxes used in mining 
and other machines, (i.e. belt conveyors, bucket wheel excavators, coal shearers, 
wind turbines and helicopters). A serious dependency between diagnostic features 
and operational conditions (speed/load) it is shown in mentioned works.  
A novel research hypothesis has been formulated that behavior of machine in 
bad condition is unstable and it is more visible for heavy loaded machine.  
It results with diagnostic data set with higher data dispersion than for healthy 
one. In the paper we will prove that feature load dependency and data dispersion 
might be a basis for novel approach for condition monitoring of gearboxes used in 
belt conveyors. An advantage of such approach is its simplicity and strong physi-
cal background.  
Keywords: belt conveyor, diagnostics, novel features, data processing.

Introduction 
Fundamental basis for decision making in condition monitoring is that given set of 
diagnostic parameters (values of vibrations, temperatures, pressures etc.) is depen-
dent on change of machine condition and independent from the rest of possible 
factors. It is well-known nowadays, many of machines operate under time varying 
load conditions (TVLC) and classical parameters (called features) might be (in 
fact they are) load/speed dependent [1,2,4]. It means that our diagnostic decision 

32 
R. Zimroz et al.
 
 
should be function of two groups of variables D=f(operating conditions descrip-
tors, machine condition descriptors) and reasoning process become complicated. 
Many researchers try to collect classical data and process them using advanced da-
ta mining techniques to cancel out influence of TVLC. For example there are pa-
pers where application of PCA [3,4] is advised. Also neural-network-based  
approaches are used. Search for load independent, fault sensitive features is diffi-
cult direction of research and still seems to be a challenging issue. Other idea, 
proposed by [1] was to extend a bit classical approach and to take into account 
second parameter(s) influencing decisions. It has appeared that simple, classical 
features are very complicated to interpret alone for TVLC case, but combining 
with descriptors of TVLC become again very intuitive and simple. 
Following based on assumptions of [1] we would like to propose a procedure 
that help us to understand the data we acquired from many gearboxes used in belt 
conveyor drives. They operate under different external load, they are in unknown 
condition and problem of proper decision making (accept to continue further oper-
ating or stop the machine?) is still open. Unfortunately, actual condition of ma-
chines, pre-defined decision threshold and methodology how to deal with such 
problem hadn’t been precisely defined until now, thus we didn’t have any key or 
reference during analysis. Due to relatively short observation (approx. 1 min) and 
actually approximately constant loading conditions during 1 min of measurement, 
the concept proposed by [1] cannot be applied directly. However, knowledge from 
that paper, number of objects and some new ideas allow us to propose a method to 
estimate what group of machines is in good, warning or bad condition, respective-
ly. The paper is organized as follows: a short review on the subject and current 
practice in the mine will be described; based on preliminary analysis, some remark 
and assumption will be formulated and novel procedure will be presented and dis-
cussed; finally, application of the method will be provided.

Problem Definition 
Machine condition monitoring means collecting signals (vibro, temperature, cur-
rent, etc.) and compare actual values with threshold. Progress in sensors data 
transmission/storage technologies make possible quick development of CM sys-
tems. Surprisingly, it appeared that there are just a few papers discuss a problem 
of decision threshold estimation in context of condition monitoring [9-11]. The 
ideal situation is when two data sets (good/bad conditions) are available. Then us-
ing statistical data modeling or neural networks so called “classification system” 
might be trained and validated using appropriate data sets. Unfortunately, in our 
case, there are several facts that make this problem very different. First, three (not 
two) classes are expected (good/warning/bad). Second, there are many data in un-
known and very different (from very good to very bad) conditions’ cases. Third, 
we have a large dataset but for many objects, for certain gearbox there are only 60 
samples of diagnostic feature. All these data are stored in kind of decision support 
system developed for maintenance management which has been used nowadays 

Novel Techniques of Diagnostic Data Processing for Belt Conveyor Maintenance

by the maintenance staff [7]. Computerised systems for maintenance management 
is a popular way for machinery management [5,6]. Values of threshold established 
in the system are probably too high, and they don’t depend on operating condi-
tions (load) that might be source of misleading decisions. 
3 
The Approach Used in the Industry and Recent Research-
Based Solutions -A Discussion 
A condition based maintenance approach were applied for discussed system in 
2009. Since then many measurement have been done (Fig. 1a). A key problem is 
to establish two values of threshold: for warning and alarm levels. Currently, in 
diagnostic Decision Support System (DSS) constant values of thresholds are used 
as presented in Fig. 1b [7].

Fig. 2 Mean values of diagnostic features and speeds for all data sets (for each gearbox) 
From the literature [1,2,13] it is known fact that one should expect two pheno-
mena in such data set: i) operating conditions expressed here as mean value of  
instantaneous speed should be time varying, ii) features should be somehow corre-
lated with speed variation (should depend on speed). At least first condition is 
clearly visible from Fig. 2: speed varies from 930 to nearly 1000rpm.

It means that one should analyze diagnostic data with reference to operating 
condition (speed here). It can be considered as the simplest form of data fusion as 
recommended in [4]. Fig. 3 shows representation of data in 2D space (2a) and vi-
sualization of decision boundaries according to Fig. 1 (thresholds does not depend 
on speed). However, it is known that in such a case due to feature-speed depen-
dency, values of thresholds should not be constant, they should be adaptively cal-
culated for actual speed value. Unfortunately, it requires kind of training process 
for extraction of knowledge about properties of bad and good datasets.

Methodology of Data Processing 
Before a novel approach will be presented, a few figures with preliminary analysis 
will be discussed. In fact, these observations have been a basis to define new ap-
proach presented in the paper. It should be noted, that it is strongly linked to pre-
vious works lead by Bartelmus and Zimroz [1,2,13] related to diagnostics of gears 
used in  bucket wheel excavator, belt conveyor and wind turbine. 
4.1 
Preliminary Analysis 
A first remark we will formulate here is related to properties of data clouds. Some 
of them are very scattered, while other are located in nearly in the same coordi-
nates on feature-speed map. What is a reason of that? We believe, that it could be 
related with technical condition of machine, and kind of its “stability” of opera-
tion. Machine in good condition should manifest following properties: small value 
of feature (classic approach) and small scatter. There are two scenarios for degra-
dation: machine could increase its feature according to wear development (and 
scatter but not so much) or could increase its scatter more than value of the fea-
ture. Fig. 4 shows mean values of data clouds (as blue *) and values of max and 
min values of features (represented as red circle). We propose to introduce  
simple parameter as a measure of data cloud scatter, namely Max-Min = max(DF)

– min(DF). Max-Min values are shown in bottom subplot, Fig. 4. Next, let’s have 
a look in Fig. 5, where Max-Min is plotted vs. diagnostic feature DF (left subplot) 
and speed (right subplot), respectively. This figure will be a basis for the method 
proposed in the next section.

Detailed analysis of Fig. 5 will allow us to notice two characteristic areas (with 
small features and scatter and big features and scatter) corresponding to two ma-
chine conditions, moreover, right subplot show how scatter depends on speed for 
healthy and worn machine in very similar way as in [1,13]  
4.2 
Proposal of a New Approach 
In this section a proposal of complete procedure describing how to process data to 
estimate decision boundaries will be presented. As it was said, the procedure is 
based on experience with mining machines, previous publications and some ob-
servation related to this specific data set. It might be possible, that this approach is 
valid for very specific data from mining machines only. The FlowChart of the me-
thod is presented in Fig. 6. According to this FlowChart, first one should check 

36 
R. Zimroz et al.
 
 
basic properties of data, their variability, feature-speed relationship and so on. If 
dataset doesn’t reveal mentioned properties, there is no need (and even more - no 
possibility!) to use our approach. Next step by step we try to understand our data 
and introduce constraints related to scatter, values of features, scatter-speed rela-
tion and we visualize iteratively results using 3 colors in feature-speed plane for 
validation.  
 
Fig. 6 FlowChart of the method 
 
Fig. 7 Supplementary explanation to the FlowChart 
As it was said, machine in good condition should manifest following proper-
ties: small values of features (classic approach) and small scatter. In Step 1 we 
identify a cluster of data (representing set of machines) with such properties. 

Novel Techniques of Diagnostic Data Processing for Belt Conveyor Maintenance 
37 
 
 
Second Step is related to preliminary identification of dataset with very big scatter 
and big values of diagnostic features (it is done based on scatter – speed relation 
analysis). Visualisations after first iteration might not be so clear due to simple de-
cisions we made. Now is time to introduce some extra constraints that are based 
on knowledge about machine. It is obvious that properly loaded (this is a reason 
we need feature-speed plot!) machine with very small features- cannot be consi-
dered as damaged. First constraints (Step 3a) is as follow: discriminate data with 
big scatter into: small and other features. It should be done by visual inspection of 
data, in the worst case the highest value from pointed out ’good condition‘ dataset 
could be used. The last step (Step3b) is related to understanding properties of data 
from class “warning” that is between good and bad condition (plotted in yellow). 
In fact it consist in 3 subclasses: medium features and scatter, small features/big 
scatter and small scatter/big features. They represent very different scenarios of 
degradation and in our opinion should not be treated in the same way [12, 13]. 
More explanation will be presented during application results discussing. 
Now we will present and discuss results obtained when applied the procedure 
to raw data presented in Fig. 1. Follow the FlowChart we provide illustration of 
each step. In Fig. 8 results for step 1 and 2 are presented. Identification of good 
condition dataset was obtained using scatter-feature-value analysis.  
 
Fig. 8 Performing of step 1 and 2: a selection of small scatter (a left) and big scatter  
(a right), b, c) visualization green-good, magenta-warning, red-bad condition. 
A value of threshold was set ThWy = 40 based on similarity (most closest) of 
cluster for good condition. From scatter-speed plot it has been found that there are 
mixture of two very different datasets: some of data create of patter significantly 
dependent of speed, while other rather not. A threshold was set ThCy = 100,  

38 
R. Zimroz et al.
 
 
Fig. 8b and c visualize our decisions. From Fig. 8c one might conclude that values 
of thresholds are not really good due to number of clusters classified as bad, but in 
fact they are located in the middle of warning and very close to good condition. 
Fig. 9 shows results for the first of constraints applied to the data. Simple linear 
discrimination for ThCx = 650 significantly improved the plot 9b. Fig. 10 presents 
a decomposition of warning class into 3 subclasses. Fig. 10b shows that data plot-
ted in black (small scatter/big feature values) should be rather considered as bad 
condition. Fig. 11 shows final picture - results of decision boundaries estimation. 
It should be noted that our warning and alarm levels are smaller than currently 
used in the mining DSS that means we are able to recognize incorrect operation of 
drive unit’s component earlier.

Conclusions 
The main aim of this work was to develop a procedure for finding of new decision 
boundaries (thresholds) to increase effectiveness of diagnostic decision support 
system (DSS) used in copper mine for belt conveyors maintenance.  
Unfortunately, the belt conveyors are particularly difficult kind of machines to 
diagnose (for various reasons), thus detailed analysis including: exploration of the 
relationships among diagnostic data, relating them to the machines’ behaviors and 
taking into account factors of degradation are needed. Currently, authors simulta-
neously are working on several ideas regarding modeling of degradation processes 
for belt conveyors. 
The novel approach presented in this paper introduces a new parameter namely 
Max-Min to determine a decision threshold. Max-Min is measure of scatter of data 
cloud from single diagnostic measurement. Multiple visualizations of Max-Min vs. 
external load or vs. mean of diagnostic features allow to divide dataset into two main 
clusters: (a) good condition characterized by data clouds with small values of features 
and small scatters, (b) bad condition - data clouds reveal high values of features and 
big scatters. Detailed analysis of obtained clusters showed that data depend on speed, 
much more for bad condition than for other classes. It follow the idea proposed in [1]. 
Moreover, for a large population of data clouds no above mentioned properties 
has been identified. It has been assumed that they represent very different scena-
rios of degradation and in our opinion should not be treated in the same way. 
Therefore, we decompose that intermediate condition, so called warning state into 
3 subclasses: (a) small scatter/big feature values, (b) big scatter/small feature val-
ues and (c) medium scatter/feature values. After further analysis we decided to 
classify “small scatter/big feature values” as a bad condition. We believe that 
these different behaviors of machines are strong dependent on: (a) operating pa-
rameters (rotational speed, external load), (b) design properties (technical configu-
ration, modulus of elasticity etc.) and (c) degree of wear (e.g. pitting, scuffing). 
What’s more, perhaps the ratio of scatter value to feature value (or similar) should 
be used to estimate failure risk index in reliability analysis or prediction of further 
degradation in belt conveyor case.

Abstract. The article is devoted to improving the efficiency of rock mass 
transportation in open-cast mining steep deposits. Implementation of cyclic-and-
continuous transport chart on these deposits is analysed. The conducted researches 
consist improvement of hard rocks and ore transportation chart that combines 
trucks, conveyor and railway. It is based on the design developed of the steeply 
inclined conveyor with a pressure belt. As a result of the proposed technology 
application is reduction of internal quarry mileage of trucks and the maximum 
output of the conveyor.  
Keywords: Hard rock, Cyclical-and-Continuous Method, Inclined Conveyor, 
Transportation System, Management Information System. 
The development of steep deposits depends on increases of the depth of the 
quarries. As a result the volumes and the distance of transportation of the 
mountain mass increase. Neither type of the quarry transport has no totality 
economic advantages which would allow to use it without other types of the 
transport one quarry of large depth. That why using of two and more types of the 
transport in independent or combined objectively unavoidable. 
The more promising is a combined motor-conveyer transport, i.e. cyclic-and-
continuous transport (CCT), which economic expediency increases with depth of 
the quarry and the rock mass. The challenges for implementation of CCT on 
working pit are placement of the conveyer systems on the formed slopes and non-
coordination of the cyclic and the continuous parts of an integral transport system.  
Increasing of effectiveness CCT consist in using the steeply inclined lifting 
conveyer that reduces up to the minimum the volumes of mining permanent works 
when preparing the route for on the formed pit walls. Unfortunately, application of 
the steeply inclined conveyers SIC in the quarries of the CIS countries was limited 
only with theoretic researches. Results of this researches were applied in the 
quarry "Muruntau" of Navoi Mining-and-Metallurgical Industrial Complex.

Aim of researches consist in development of efficient CCT for the deep quarry 
on the base of resource-saving cyclic-and-continuous transport with steeply 
inclined conveyer (SIC). 
For realize this idea the Navoi MMIC has adopted and fulfilled a program with 
main specialists from Ukraine. The main components of CCT-ore: CRS - 
crushing-reloading station (point); SIC – steeply inclined conveyer, LSC - 
loading-storage complex; ASMODU – automated system of monitoring and 
operative-dispatcher control (fig. 1, 2).

This innovative technology of the cyclic-and-continuous transport was created 
with joint efforts of Navoi MMIC, designers, developers, scientists and machine-
builders whose collectives are in Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Russia. Thus, it was 
confirmed again that the most significant results are achieved on the junction of 
the sciences when integrating the efforts of scientists, developers, specialists of 
machine-building and operating enterprises. 
In the process of the project development, manufacturing, installation and 
commissioning of the steeply inclined conveyer SIC-270 it had been set to the 
developed design of the steeply inclined conveyer with a rider belt is operable, has 
high reliability, ensures stable reception, lifting at angle of 37 degrees at the height 
of 270 m and unloading of the crushed rock mass with capacity of more than  
3500 t/h (fig. 3) 
 
 
Fig. 3 Inclined lifting conveyer 
The created steeply inclined conveyer SIC-270 satisfies the conditions of 
operation in the quarry, is provided with the servicing facilities, is recognized to 
be  successful solution and is recommended for use and. This conveyor can 
combine in the unique module the lifting and the transferring functions that is its 
feature in the quarry "Muruntau" (fig. 2). The route of the steeply inclined 
conveyer to be placed perpendicularly to the berms of the ledges at general angle 
of the inclination of the pit wall. 
The developed design layout of pivot joint of the sections between themselves 
and the supports on the ledges along the entire length of the steep part without 
discontinuities for compensation of temperature deformation of supporting metal 
structures confirmed its operability and reliability. 
Slope on the area of placing SIC-270 is sufficiently stable, the possibility of 
appearance of large deformations being able to result in emergency situations is 
practically absent, and the design of the foundation structures for supports (know 
how) reduces the possibility of local collapses of the ledges with deformation of 
support of the steep part of SIC-270. The safety factors of mountain massifs from 
their additional loading with steeply inclined conveyer are 1.3...1.95.

The possibility of installation on the pit wall of large components (length 51 m, 
cross-section 18 m2 and weight 84 tons) of steep part of SIC-270 is proved with 
the consecutive lowering of the sections on the guides stacked on the upper 
structure of supporting metal structures. 
The screw-tooth crusher confirmed its operability on the rocky mountain mass 
of the quarry "Muruntau". For the increase of its capacity up to the design values 
and the durability of its operating elements the grate bars for the preliminary 
screening before the crushing are provided.  
In the process of installation and commissioning of the loading-storage 
complex on the surface of the quarry "Muruntau" it has been set to that self-
propelled rocky loader-stacker ensures the continuous direct flow loading of the 
ore into the dump cars or to the storage. In result, the continuous delivery of the 
ore from the bottom of the quarry to the plant without unnecessary transshipment 
on the surface is formed (fig. 4). It was determined that the combined capacity of 
operative and motor transport warehouse provides six days stock of the ore for its 
shipment to the plant.

Installation of the additional conveyer line gave to the CCT system the 
additional flexibility which allows to adapt it to the current prevalence of the 
volumes of mixed flows of the ore or overburden which is formed in the quarry. 
At the installation and commissioning of ASMODU (automated system of 
monitoring and operative-dispatcher control) of the continuous transport for the 
ore of the quarry "Muruntau" was determined that the multi-level computer-aided 
system of control Automated Control System "PT-ore" having more than 1300 
physical inputs/outputs proved its operability and reliability, provided the high 
level of supervision, protection, control and monitoring which assist to the 
increase of the readiness of the continuous transport to the operation and to the 
reduction of the time of operability restoration after the emergency shutdowns. 
The practical implementation of the ASMODU with positive result can be 
regarded as the base one for the quarries and mining reductions of concentrating

factories, has the sufficient flexibility of the software-hardware that will allow to 
increase, to enhance and to adapt it to the different technological schemes with 
continuous transport in which the screens and the crushers are integrated. 
The cyclic-and-continuous transport on the base of steeply inclined conveyer 
SIC-270 with deep input into the quarry have next advantages. 
SIC is installed practically without additional mining preparatory works on the 
narrow section of the pit wall that does not restrict the expansion of the mining 
along the entire contour of the quarry, does not require the laying of the special 
trenches or sinking operations (comparing to the traditional slightly inclined 
conveyers the steeply inclined conveyer takes up by 25-50% less area of the 
workspace).  
Creation of the transport berms in the mountain part with the corresponding 
separation of the pit wall in this zone is not necessary for entrance of technological 
transport to CRP and that allows to retain its general angle of inclination. The 
combined parallel operation of two belts increase their resulting strength and 
tractive ability of the drives that increases the height of the lifting of the mountain 
mass with one conveyer without overloading. 
Proposed technological chart allows the further depth increase of the 
continuous part sinking of CCT up to 450 m. When transporting the ore the 
necessity of its primary crushing in the process of processing at the plant. The 
loads losses due to the reduction of blowing and spilling of the transported cargo, 
the environmental situation of mining enterprise is improved.  
It should be specially noted that with the average operation life of the dump 
trucks being 6-7 years, during the resource life of CCT operation during 20 years 
it would be necessary to renew three times the park of dump trucks which is 
released by the continuous transport; 
For analyse effectiveness of proposed CCT in condition of "Muruntau" its 
parameters was compare with well known analogues. In the domestic mining 
industry and CIS countries there are no samples of CCT with steeply inclined 
conveyer. The nearest analogue in the world's practice of open pit mining 
(Majdanpek, Serbia) according to the height of the lifting is approximately one 
third of the created one (table 1).

Industrial operation of steeply inclined conveyor with a pressure belt in the 
"Muruntau" pit was started from 2011. On this time were shipped more then 17 
million tons of rock mass. The maximum shift capacity of 46.3 thousand tons for 
12 hours shift or 3860 t/h was achieved. The maximum monthly capacity of 
458000 m3 or 1.19 million tons per month was achieved that will allow the 
capacity of the continuous transport being more than 13 million tons of the 
mountain mass per annum. 
The same continuous transport has possibility to put out the overburden from 
the quarry which through the system of additional conveyers is delivered to the 
dump passing the ore warehouse (thus, the CCT system was given additional 
flexibility which allows to adapt it to the main cargo flow being formed in the 
quarry: ore or overburden). 
At the transportation of mixed overburden and ore with application of the 
continuous transport on the base of SIC-270, the distance of the transportation 
with motor transport was decreased by 3.6 km, and the transport run was 
decreased by 40 %. 
Developed technological decision allow to increase the coefficient of the 
readiness of the continuous transport from Cr=0.717 to Cr=0.842 of operation 
periods. The reliability of adopted and realized solutions will not restrain the 
increase of the transportation of the mountain mass in the cyclic elements of the 
quarry and annual capacity reach to 16 million tons. 
According to the data of Navoi MMIC the economic effect for the mixed 
mountain mass (overburden and ore) which has been already obtained from the 
creation of the cyclic-and-continuous transport on the base of steeply inclined 
conveyer SIC-270 for year 2012 amount 1.53 million USD.

Abstract. The performance of bucket-wheel excavators used for the selective 
mining of multiple-layered lignite deposits is mainly determined by the physical 
and mechanical properties of the excavated material (digability parameters), as 
well as by the thickness and the inclination of the excavated layer. The lack of suf-
ficient information regarding the diggability of the excavated layers during mine 
design stage results in a poor estimation of the bucket-wheel excavator’s perform-
ance. Such inaccurate estimation could lead to inappropriate equipment selection. 
The possibility of prediction of the bucket-wheel excavator performance by using 
an expert system was investigated in the present study. The development of the 
expert system was based on the existing boreholes’ data related to physical and 
mechanical properties of waste and lignite layers, on their geological descriptions 
and on the existing experiential knowledge about selective mining by bucket-
wheel excavators.  
The developed expert system was applied for the prediction of the performance 
of the bucket-wheel excavators used for the exploitation of Mavropigi Lignite 
Mine in Ptolemais area (Northern Greece).

Introduction 
Lignite is the most important domestic fuel of Greece, used almost exclusively for 
power generation. The annual lignite production in Greece in 2013 was ~53 Mt,

while the electricity produced from the lignite-fired power plants comprised the 
48% of the total power generation. Lignite is mined mainly by the Public Power 
Corporation S.A. (PPC) and is considered a strategic fuel for Greece due to secure 
supply and controllable cost; consequently it gives a competitive strength in 
Greece’s fuel mix. The remaining lignite reserves that are suitable for electricity 
generation are 2.5 billion tones (2013) [1].  
Most of the Greek lignite deposits have a multiple-layer structure and are lo-
cated in the Ptolemais - Amynteon basin, in the area of Western Macedonia in 
northern Greece. For the exploitation of these deposits, the continuous surface 
mining method is used. High capacity bucket wheel excavators (BWE), conveyor 
belts and spreaders are used to achieve high output rate with low cost of mined 
lignite per ton [2,3]. Nowadays, the Western Macedonia Lignite Centre (WMLC) 
has four large scale open pit mines, which handle 315 Mm3 of material and pro-
duce 43.6 Mt of lignite (2013). The lignite deposits under exploitation cover an 
area of 160 Km2 including 1200 Mt of proven geological reserves and 1000 Mt of 
exploitable reserves under the current economic and technological criteria. It is es-
timated that the lignite of the Ptolemais-Amynteon basin is sufficient to supply the 
existing power plants for another 15-25 years.  
The multiple-layered lignite deposits, which are characterized by the extreme 
splitting of lignite seams separated by non-lignite layers, make the selective min-
ing a necessity (Figure 1). The alternated waste layers, mainly marls and clays, are 
of varying thickness and cohesion and also exhibit intense spatial fluctuation. In 
addition, the presence of hard formations in the overburden, consisting mostly of 
conglomerates and stiff sandstones, impose the use of discontinuous exploitation 
methods (hydraulic excavators and/or blasting and trucks) either independently or 
in combination with the existing continuous surface equipment. The implementa-
tion of selective mining procedures by terrace cutting and the occurrence of cohe-
sive and hard formations affect decisively the performance of the used bucket 
wheel excavators. Hence the estimation of the effect of the geometrical, physical 
and mechanical properties of the excavated material, which determine decisively 
its digability,  on the performance of the bucket wheel excavators is crucial for the 
appropriate long and short-term mine planning and design activities. However, the 
lack of sufficient information regarding the digability of the excavated layers dur-
ing mine design stage in combination with the observed intense spatial fluctuation 
of the excavated material could result in poor estimation of the bucket-wheel ex-
cavator’s performance. Such inaccurate estimation could lead to inappropriate 
equipment selection.  
In the present study a new methodology for the prediction of the bucket-wheel 
excavator performance by using expert systems is proposed. The developed expert 
system is used to assess the diggability of the excavated blocks, while their thick-
ness is estimated by the existing conventional practices used for the evaluation of 
multiple-layered lignite deposits. Expert system reasoning is based on the existing 
boreholes’ data describing the lithology of the drilled geological formations, as 
well as on the acquired experiential knowledge about mining these formations by 
bucket-wheel excavators.

in the area of Ptolemais in Northern Greece, a sophisticated evaluation methodol-
ogy, based on exploitation and quality criteria, has been developed [10-12]. It 
takes into account the minimum thickness for the selective mining of lignite and 
waste layers, as well as the maximum allowable ash content of mined lignite. 
These parameters affect significantly not only the recovery of the deposit and the 
quality of the mined lignite, but also the efficiency of the excavating equipment. 
According to this methodology thin non-lignite layers (with thickness less than the 
minimum thickness for selective mining by BWE) can be included in the mineable 
lignite blocks if the quality requirements for the excavated lignite are fulfilled. On 
the other hand, thin lignite layers which cannot be excavated selectively are in-
cluded in the waste blocks. The thickness of the formed mineable lignite or waste 
blocks have a significant effect on the efficiency of the bucket-wheel excavators 
which are used in these selective mining operations. The productivity of the buck-
et-wheel excavators drops significantly as the ratio h/R decreases (where, R is the 
radius of bucket wheel and h is the thickness of the excavated block) as shown in 
figure 2 [12].

Apart from diggability and excavated block thickness, the performance of a 
BWE is also affected by BWE type and rated capacity, operation cycle, equipment 
breakdowns, external delay factors, management, personnel skills and working 
conditions. In this study we focus on the diggability and thickness since these fac-
tors are considered crucial for the BWE performance during the selective mining 
of multiple-layered lignite deposits [12].

Expert Systems (ES) 
The Expert Systems (ES) derive from the scientific area of Artificial Intelligence 
and were developed to solve specific problems by using specialized knowledge. 
An expert system, also known as knowledge based system (KBS), is in effect a 
computer program that encompasses the knowledge and analytical skills of one or 
more human experts in the domain of a specific problem. The goal of the design of 
the expert system is to capture the knowledge of a human expert relative to some 
specific domain and code this in a computer in such a way that the knowledge of 
the expert is available to a less experienced user [13,14] 
The basic components of an ES, shown schematically in figure 3, are:  
the knowledge acquisition module, the knowledge base, the inference engine, the 
explanation facility and the user interface [13].  
 
 
Fig. 3 Schematic representation of an expert system structure 
Knowledge acquisition refers to acquiring, restoring the knowledge collected 
and organized in cooperation with the experts in the specific domain. It is a sub-
system used to build knowledge bases. The techniques used for knowledge acqui-
sition are protocol analysis, interviews, and observation. The process of acquiring 
knowledge is the most critical point in the development of an ES.  
The knowledge base contains the knowledge necessary for understanding, for-
mulating and solving problems. The acquired knowledge can be distinguished into 
factual and heuristic knowledge. Factual knowledge is that knowledge of the task 
domain that is widely shared, while heuristic knowledge is mainly experiential and 
largely individualistic. Factual knowledge is represented as facts, while heuristic is 
represented as rules. The facts are information that is generally known or

published and generally accepted by the experts of the specific domain. The rules, 
unlike the facts, are a way of thinking and judgment characterizing the modus op-
erandi and the skills of an expert. For the creation of rules the logical operators 
AND, OR and NOT in conjunction with the operator IF and THEN are used. The 
general form of these rules is:  
 
IF F(1) AND F(2) AND F(3)……AND F(N) 
THEN Η 
or 
IF F(1) OR F(2) OR F(3)……OR F(N) 
THEN Η 
 
where:  F(1)……F(N)  are the facts and Η is the consequent  
 
The inference engine must be independent of the acquired knowledge. The rea-
son is that our knowledge in a specific field is changing but the way of reasoning 
and drawing conclusions should remain stable to ensure consistency, accuracy and 
completeness. The way of reasoning used by the ES inference engine is: forward, 
backward and sideways chain. The forward chain of reasoning takes into account 
the facts and is driven to the assumption or conclusion (synthetic thinking). The 
backward chain of reasoning takes into account the conclusion or the fact and tries 
to find data supporting this fact or conclusion (analytical thinking). Finally, the si-
deway chain of reasoning is a combination of the two above.  
An ES must be able to explain how the conclusions were drawn and the need to 
obtain specific information from the user. For this purpose special programs have 
been developed to track the inference path. The user can at any time ask the ES 
why this rule was fired or how that conclusion was drawn. Finally, the user inter-
face enables the communication of the ES with the user and must be as user 
friendly as possible.

Methodology for the Estimation of BWE Performance 
The proposed methodology for the estimation of the effect of material diggability 
and excavated blocks thickness on the BWE performance includes the following 
stages: 
• 
Development of an ES for the assessment of the diggability of excavated 
geological formations. This assessment is based on the lithology descrip-
tion of the related drillhole cores.  
• 
Determination of the mineable lignite and waste blocks for selective min-
ing as described above (section 2). This includes the estimation of the 
thickness of the blocks as well as the assessment of the diggability of the 
excavated block.   
• 
Estimation of the impact of diggability and thickness of excavated block 
on BWE performance.

4.1 
Development of an ES for the Assessment of Diggability 
The assessment of the diggability was based on the existing information obtained 
during the detailed exploration of the lignite deposit. The coding of the boreholes’ 
data is particularly useful, since it significantly reduces the size of the created 
files, makes data entry and correction very easy and, finally, significantly im-
proves searching, matching and comparison efficiency. For each drilled geological 
layer there is a record describing its lithology, texture, inclusions, color, etc. After 
rigorous exanimation of these recorded parameters by experienced mining engi-
neers and geologists of the Mine Division of the Power Public Corporation of 
Greece, three of them were selected to be used by ES for diggability assessment: 
the major lithology description (MM), the additional   lithology description (S) 
and the texture (T). Typical coding cases for MM, S and T are shown in Table 1.  
Regarding the classification of the excavated material according to its diggabil-
ity a five-level scale is proposed, as indicated in Table 2. Furthermore a rough es-
timation of the expected performance of the BWE in each diggability class is also 
suggested. This performance is expressed as percentage of the BWE performance 
achieved when excavates easily diggable materials (diggability=1).  
In the developed knowledge base facts are considered to be the material proper-
ties as described by the selected parameters (MM, S and T). These fact are con-
nected with the logical operators AND, OR and NOT and in conjunction with IF – 
THEN operators create a set of rules. A typical form of such a rule is:  
IF MM = "MR" AND AND S = "K" AND T = "M"   
THEN Diggabilty = 2

The above rule assigns the diggability value of 2 (diggable) to a soft (T="M") 
calcitic (S="K") marl layer (MM= "MR"). Moreover the BWE performance is ex-
pected to be 75% of the achieved in easily diggable material.  
The developed knowledge base of the current ES version contains 104 rules 
and uses the forward chain of reasoning. The ES was developed in Visual Basic 
within the Excel environment.

Estimation of the Impact of Excavated Block Thickness to 
the BWE Performance 
The performance of a BWE during selective mining is also significantly affected 
by the thickness of the excavated block. The determination of the mineable lignite 
and waste blocks and their thickness was carried out by using the software 
METAL developed by PPC [10]. The impact of excavated block thickness on a 
BWE performance is calculated from the diagram shown in figure 2. This perfor-
mance is also given as a percentage of the nominal BWE output rate.  
Finally the overall performance of a BWE is estimated by multiplying the per-
formance value considering the diggability and the performance value considering 
the thickness of the excavated block.

Application of the Developed Methodology in the 
Mavropigi Lignite Mine 
The Mavropigi lignite mine is the newest of the four operational surface mines at 
the Lignite Center of Western Macedonia, covering an area of 11km2. The remain-
ing mineable reserves were estimated at ~ 140 Mt of lignite. The annual planned 
lignite production of the mine is ~ 8 Mt, while the majority of the lignite mined is 
fed to the nearby power plant of Ptolemais and Liptol with a total nominal output 
of 663 MW. The Mavropigi lignite deposit was explored by 230 drillholes, with 
an average spacing of ~230 m. The thickness of the lignite deposit (lignite and in-
terbedded waste layers) varies from 50 to 250 m while the thickness of the over-
burden from 10 to 50m. At present there are two overburden benches and six  

Development of an Expert System for the Prediction of the Performance 
55 
 
lignite benches in operation. The installed equipment includes eight bucket wheel 
excavators, three spreaders and 40km of conveyor belts.   
The most frequently occurring geological formations, as coded according to 
Table 1, are lignite (CO), marl (MR), clay (AL) and sand. Typical additional litho-
logical characterizations of these formations include the terms: clayey (Τ), sandy 
(S), carbonaceous (C), calcitic (Κ) and sandstone inclusions (Z). Finally the most 
frequently observed textures were described as loose (Α), compacted (C), hard 
(Η), and semisoft (Υ). 
The application of the developed methodology for the estimation of BWE per-
formance in Mavropigi mine was based on data selected from 211 drillholes’ data. 
By using the developed ES a diggability value was assigned for each geological 
formation included in the drillhole database. After that, the mineable lignite and 
waste blocks for selective mining were determined and the thickness and the diga-
bility of each block were estimated. Taking into consideration the technical char-
acteristics of the used BWEs (i.e. bucket wheel diameter) the performance of 
BWE during the excavation of each mineable block was estimated. Finally a three 
dimensional interpolation and representation of these estimated values was per-
formed by using the software Voxler (Golden Software). 
Figure 4 shows the spatial variation of the estimated diggability values along 
the major axis and along the one perpendicular to the major axis. Diggability va-
ries mainly depending  on depth.  The majority of the formations indicate values 
between 1-3 and rarely 3-4. Only at the border of the deposit have formations been 
identified which cannot be excavated by a BWE without prior loosening by rip-
ping or blasting (diggabilty value from 4 to 5). More specifically, the formations 
above the level of 670m (overburden) present low diggability values (1-2) and can 
be classified as easily excavated by BWE according to Table 2. This is due to the 
fact that these layers consist mainly of loose formations (gravel, sand and soft 
clays) which show small cutting resistance and low adhesiveness. The deposit 
formations (below the level of 670m) show diggability values varying from 2 to 3 
and rarely 4 and are classified accordingly either as diggable or as difficult to dig 
by BWE. The difficulty of extraction of these formations by BWE is due to the 
relatively high cutting resistance values which cohesive layers like the compacted 
marls and stiff clays with hard sandstone inclusions exhibit. 
 Figure 5 represents the effect of the mineable blocks thickness on BWE per-
formance. BWE performance is relatively high since it varies from 40% to 100% 
of the   maximum expected value as defined in Table 2. More specifically, the per-
formance during the excavation of relatively thin blocks, located below the level 
of 550m, is expected to fluctuate between 40 to 70%.  From the level of 550m to 
700m the performance of a BWE increases significantly since it varies from 60 to 
100%. In the upper level (above 700m) BWE performance reach its maximum 
value since almost all the excavating blocks have considerable thickness. 
Finally, Figure 6 shows the overall performance of a BWE (includes both digga-
bility and thickness effect). The higher BWE performances observed in the upper 
part of the deposit in the overburden benches (above the level of 700m) are related 
to thick excavated blocks (selective mining is not required in these benches)

the level of 700m to 550m the performance decreases since it varies from 40-50%,  
while below the level of 550m the performance is further reduced to 20-25%. The 
drop  in BWE performance is due to the decrease of the thickness of the formed 
mineable blocks (selective mining) as well as to the relatively lower diggability 
that the excavated material exhibits.

Conclusions 
The applied methodology for the evaluation of multiple-layered lignite deposits is 
significantly improved when combined with an expert system for the assessment 
of the diggability of the excavated geological formations since it leads to the pre-
diction of the performance of the used bucket-wheel excavators, which are consi-
dered to be critical elements in the overall continuous mining system.

Problems of Bucket-Wheel Excavators Body

Open Pit Mines

An Influence of Ground on Specific Operational Loadings 
of Bucket-Wheel Excavators 
During Pleistocene the area of Poland has underwent an influence of several 
glaciers. This resulted in high density of ground and pushed in stones and erratic 
boulders of various size. Such a situation causes not only an increase of mining 
resistance, but also an increase of number of impact loadings and their value. 
According to the data, 13% of machine breakdowns in Polish open pit mines is a 
result of extreme geological conditions. As much again happens because of 
maladjustment of mining technology to a current circumstance [2]. Altogether – 
above a quarter of all breakdowns.  
In difficult ground conditions (IV and V class of gettability) mining absorbs up 
to 50% of excavator’s total power consumption. Costs of repairs and changes of 
buckets working in the same conditions are also about 50% of year expenses on 
excavators repairs. This situation worsens with the depth of mining (fig. 1). 
Additionally, majority of excavators working in Polish open pit mines exceeded 
their expected lifetime. Thus, residual durability of their structures is decreasing in 
quite high rate. In this situation no attempts of reducing the influence of excessive 
loadings is going to result in increase of excavators failure frequency and decrease 
of profitability of mines. Yet a cost of purchasing new machines is huge, so the 
exploiters aim at maintenance of existing fleet of machines in safe operation. 
Mentioned heterogeneity of mined ground provides also significant difficulties 
in load model building. Due to mining technology, load vectors are random in 
every respect – their number, directions, values and points of application are 
changeable. This state enables a modelling only at a high degree of generalization. 
And what follows – the influence of operational loadings on durability of a 
structure’s individual subassemblies is estimated with not sufficient precision. 
Also there is there is no certainty about assumption of linearity of a system, which 
is the structure of the excavator. Especially in the matter of extreme loads. 
The article presents the most important achievements of Polish centres 
(research and industrial) connected with open pit mining branch. These solutions 
were developed with intention to solve problems resulting from more and more 
difficult mining conditions.

Resonance – The First Diagnosed Problem Resulting from 
Dynamic Overloads 
At the beginning of 90’s a worrying effect had been noticed – an excessive 
dynamics of body’s structure of some bucket-wheel excavators [1]. The 
amplitudes of vibrations not only lowered working comfort, but also were so high 
that significantly disturbed any control of machine operation. In extreme cases it 
was impossible for staff to walk safely along the bucket wheel boom. Next, 
numerous and fast-propagating fatigue cracks started to appear (fig. 2) [2,8]. A 
reduction of structure’s vibration can be achieved by lowering on intensity of 
operation. Yet it is not in mines’ economic interest and cannot be accepted as a 
final solution.  
Before taking any remedial actions, reasons of such state had to be identified. 
During the research, it was found that the cause of the increase of amplitudes was 
a formation of resonant vibration. For this purpose specially designed in Machine 
Designing and Operation Institute (Mechanical Division, Wroclaw University of 
Technology) strain gauge measuring circuit enabling measures of vibration in 
orthogonal directions (vertical bending, horizontal bending and compression) was 
used. Then the structure was excitated by impact loadings of various values (fig. 
3). This way excavator’s structure modal vibrations had been obtained. One of the 
frequencies present in those signals was same as the frequency resulting from the 
buckets and rotation of the bucket wheel. Operational vibration were also 
registered and they confirmed a resonance hypothesis [1].

where: m – mass, c – damping, k – stiffness, F(t) – external force, to change 
machine’s natural frequencies and move it out of resonant area, one can: 
• 
change the frequency of pouring outs (from buckets to belt conveyor), 
• 
change the body’s mass, 
• 
increase body’s stiffness. 
It’s obvious that a change of excavator’s body mass isn’t preferred solution. 
Increasing of structure’s stiffness is also troublesome. So the easiest and most 
preferred solution is a change in external force frequency. It is achieved by 
changing the final drive ratio (bucket wheel drive). It is also preferable, because it 
enables increasing of output.

Described procedure is successfully repeated on many other bucket-wheel 
excavators. Since the time of first such application, identification of modal 
frequencies of an individual machine has become a standard procedure carried out 
before placing it in service (new excavators, after major repairs and 
modernizations).

Impact Loadings and Transient Vibrations 
Impact loadings are regarded as the most dangerous operational loadings. It’s 
because they provide the largest amount of energy and can cause transient 
vibrations. Those loadings develop when a bucket strikes a well settled stone or a 
hard rock of dimensions larger than a single bucket. This happens randomly and is 
difficult to predict. Designing standards protect the structure against such loads by 
multiplying digging force by dynamic factor. Yet this approach doesn’t include a 
different character of dynamic loadings. Results of rapid stroke are transmitted 
between subassemblies to the further parts of the excavator’s structure. It also 
happened that it resulted in serious damages and crashes of bucket-wheel 
excavators [2]. Model research carried out at Machine Designing and Operation 
Institute, approved also numerically, showed that maximal impact effects in 
bucket wheel boom appear when the force is applied at angle 60° to the vertical. 
At that time compressed bars of main truss are exposed to the greatest effort and 
can easily undergo buckling. For example, sometimes bucket wheel booms in 
SRs-1200 excavators can reach 64 MPa during impact loading with mean dynamic 
stress of 24 MPa.  
Impact loadings during operation can’t be avoided. Only an effective solution 
for cutting off an energy excess against transmitting it through the structure can be 
proposed. It is implemented by various kinds of couplings: 
• 
a mechanical friction clutch located on a beginning of gear shaft – a 
traditional solution, unreliable, requires frequent and burdensome 
regulation, isn’t a good protection against impacts, 
• 
a mechanical friction clutch together with hydrodynamic coupling 
located between an engine and a gear – proper for moderating a start-up, 
but not for as overload coupling, besides, it is also an additional 
rotational mass, 
• 
an electrical braking by counter-current – instantly stops a bucket wheel, 
but much overloads elements of a gear. 
So far, the most efficient solution was a strain gauge overload balance. It cuts 
off a drive inside main planetary gear. This led to significant decrease in number 
of break-downs of excavators SchRs-4000. 
In the history of Polish open pit mining there were several cases of serious 
damages caused by impact loadings. The most interesting is the case of two

In the result of further research it turned out that impact loadings may be 
dangerous not only due to their high energy. It was found that some of such events 
are accompanied by formation of additional frequencies in a structure [5]. This 
research is currently continued in a direction of stating the way of impact’s dynamic 
influence on excavator’s body structure. The reason for that is a hypothesis saying 
that at least some of impacts are connected to transients, which may be responsible 
for fatigue cracks appearing in unpredictable locations and progressing quite fast. 
Moreover it was noticed, that coincidence of impacts and untypical vibrations is the 
more probable, the highest is the excess of such impact above the rest of the values in 
its nearest neighbourhood (fig. 5 a). Not like it was believed earlier [4] – connected to 
absolute value of impacts (fig. 5 b). Other details can be found in [4].

After conducting such a research, the mechanism of transients’ influence on an 
effort of excavator structure is going to be uncovered. On the basis of a graph 
analogous to fig. 5 a. it will become possible to estimate residual fatigue life of 
neuralgic sections of a structure in current working conditions.

KWK-910 Compact Bucket-Wheel Excavator 
Domestic production of basic machines for open pit mining has been extended 
with a new generation excavator. This is a compact bucket-wheel excavator for 
hardly workable geological formations. This KWK-910 excavator (fig.6) has been 
designed, constructed and assembled completely using polish companies only. 
The author of this project was SKW Design and Technical Office, which also 
supervised a building process of this excavator.

The machine has been equipped with a modern mining system with ability of 
cutting off impact excesses. Allows mining many types of rocks (with a linear 
resistance up to 200 kN/m) without a need of loosening them. 
 
Fig. 6 KWK-910 excavator during a passage from assembly site to working level – clear 
signs of driving along the curves of with a small radius (25 m) 
A double 500 kW bucket-wheel drive consists of a special bevel planetary gear, 
in which a special overload coupling was built in. The coupling allows instant (0,1 
- 0,15 s) cutting off of dynamic excesses of certain values. One of the most 
important aims in choosing such drive construction is a protection of buckets and 
a steel structure of body from dynamics of mining process. For this purpose also  
a bucket-wheel with a large number (16 pcs) of buckets was chosen. This enables 
a simultaneous participation of four buckets in cutting process. 
From December 2006 to December 2008 over 4000 cut-offs was noticed 
(impacts ≥460 kN). Although such large number of coupling cut-offs, no 
significant wear of break disk was found. 
Parameters of mining system (fig. 7, other parameters of the excavator are 
presented in [7]): 
• 
power: 2x 500 kW, 
• 
bucket-wheel diameter: 10,2 m, 
• 
number of buckets: 16 pcs, 
• 
nominal bucket capacity: 910 l, 
• 
number of pours: 66,5 1/min.

The body’s structure has been designed for high fatigue resistance. Structural 
nodes have been designed to avoid stress concentration in welded joints areas. In 
the structure’s main assemblies connections, movable joints have been introduced. 
This solution eliminates harmful influences from bending moments in places of 
rigidity step-change. 
KWK-910 excavator’s compact outline has been shaped in a way that allows 
advisable dynamic characteristics. This is to limit resonant vibrations due to input 
force frequency resulting from the mining process. Additionally, a continuous 
recording of stress spectrum is conducted in selected important locations at the 
body’s structure. This enables an on-line estimation of fatigue life (details in [6]). 
Special advantages of designed crawlers allow for transportation at slope 1:15 
and mining at 1:20. The smallest turning radius is 25 m.  
SKW Design and Technical Office – a leading Polish design office for mining 
machines [15], in cooperation with “Turów” open pit mine, managed to introduce 
into operation a modern, highly automated bucket-wheel excavator KWK-910. 
Equipped with visualization of control and diagnostic process, with cctv, alarm 
system, fire-fighting system etc. Widely applied user-friendly and nature-friendly 
solutions places this excavator among the most up-to-date machines for open pit 
mining.

New Buckets 
On the basis of many years of experiences, SKW Design and Technical Office 
proposed two projects of buckets for cutting hard geological formations [14]. First 
of them – R12-N2 – has been designed for already existing KWK-1200 excavators 
(SchRs-1200 after modernization). The second one – CK910-N3 – has aroused for 
the newly designed compact KWK-910 excavator. The main idea behind both 
projects was to reduce repair costs and prolong the life of the whole bucket. 
Therefore a new shape of the cutting edges – corners and knife – have been 
proposed (Fig. 8). 
 
Fig. 8 Buckets for hard geological formations R12-N2 (at left) i CK910-N3 (at right) 
Three pyramidal teeth in corners are located properly to the trajectory of 
cutting. In the initial stages of wear it ensures an optimal cutting angle 45°. Such a 
shape of cutting edges provides lower thrust force during whole wearing process. 
It also allows maintaining still advantageous cutting angle ≤60° in the final stages 
of wear with a requirement of self-sharpening (fig. 9). Special configuration of the 
lower tool flank (behind the teeth) ensures lowering influence of forces, which is 
particularly important while working in hard grounds.  
In order to minimalize the volume of solids in the process of digging, each of the 
three corner teeth crushes independently and with a quite large advance in relation to 
knife. It results in lightening the abrasive wear of the knife. Therefore it doesn’t 
wear as fast as it was for an old-type buckets. Hence main repairs of buckets are 
reduced to an easy exchange of corners. Additionally, such a structure concentrates 
stress in the corner part of the knife (the most stiff) and in the pre-knife. 
Cutting corners for the buckets are made of a special alloy cast steel 
(chromium-nickel-molybdenum), which has high strength properties. It also 
enables deep hardening (ca. 150 mm) and multiple welding of corner and knife 
(used corners exchange). During intensive abrasive wear and impact loadings, 
padding welds on teeth undergo crumbling, distortion, cause high growth of 
digging resistance and finally premature destruction of knives and whole buckets. 
Therefore pad welding in R12-N2 and CK910-N3 buckets should be limited only 
to surfaces of knives. In the case of exchanging corners, annealing of the whole 
bucket is also not recommended. The design of both buckets allows for changing 

68 
W. Huss
 
corners 10-15 times without a necessity of changing the knife. The shape of the 
corner has been designed so the stress in weld between corner and knife is quite 
low. During three months of using CK910-N3 buckets for mining very hard rocks, 
only a few number of weld breaks had been noticed. 
 
Fig. 9 Wear of CK910-N3 bucket corners after ca. 136 hours of digging hard grounds 
A geometric and strength durability of teeth, low failure frequency of buckets, 
self-sharpening and minimization of thrust force are the technical and economic 
advantages of these dwo proposed buckets.

Materials in Construction of Bucket-Wheel Excavators 
Simultaneously with designing of mining machines in Poland, a research on the 
change of materials for newly built and modernized machines has been taken. This 
research was undertaken by Materials Science and Technical Mechanics Institute 
from Mechanical Division at Wroclaw University of Technology.  
Research conducted within the theory of degradation showed that usage of 
unalloyed, low-carbon and effervescing steel is quite dangerous for structures of 
excavators bodies. However, an influence of degradation process on machines 
operation has been eliminated due to an improvement of welding technology. 
Another issue raising durability of structures was a recognition [11] and 
application [13] of modern corrosion protection methods (not only passive, but 
also through design solutions). 

Problems of Bucket-Wheel Excavators Body in Hardly-Workable Grounds

Other achievements was a deep recognition of structures and properties of 
L35GSM cast steel [10] as well as its multi-variant heat treatment (also austenitic 
cast steel L120G13). Despite that, some cases of fracture of track links eyes (in 
pre-operational state) or fracture of wheel rim teeth (after short time of operation, 
ex. 4 years) still happen. 
Finally, a significant progress was noticed in the field of selection of chemical 
components of electrodes and technology of pad welding for surfaces exposed to 
friction wear during dynamic loading [9]. It turned out that it isn’t true that the 
harder padding welt, the better it is. 
Also some new materials were introduced. Never before low-alloyed, 
martensitic Hardox steel were used for open pit mining machines.  
7 
Hardox Group Steels 
Hardox have been produced since 1970 (as Hardox 400) and up to now six grades 
of them are available. An evaluation of their operational behaviour wasn’t carried 
or was negative. Beside a manufacturer’s information, there was hardly any other 
research. 
The manufacturer describes them as “high quality, resistant to abrasion steel”. 
It is characterized by high wear resistance, ability to being machined by 
specialized tools, good weldability, high mechanical properties and impact 
resistance. Martensitic steel from Hardox group have a tensile strength from 1250 
MPa (Hardox 400) to 2000 MPa (Hardox 600). Their microstructures are obtained 
from the normalized states through hardening in water and tempering in 
temperatures 200-700°C. 
A comparative research has been carried out for Hardox 400, Hardox 500 and 
18G2A steel. For this purpose plates made of those kinds were prepared and 
placed in the most abrasively loaded location at the fixed chute of bucket wheel 
(fig. 10). Then they were put into operation for 595 hours – an overburden of 
sanded clay was being mined out. Recorded values were: time of operation until a 
change of each plate, degree of abrasive wear and a place of attaching. 
The comparative evaluation of chute condition was: 
• 
18G2A steel with padding welt – fractures of padding welt and attrition 
in some places throughout, rounded edges. 
• 
Hardox stell – attrition to ca. 3-4 mm in the most intensively loaded 
places, but flat and smooth surface kept, no fractres or chipping, rounded 
edges. 
• 
Lining plates made of Hardox 500 showed much lower abrasive wear 
than plates of Hardox 400.

Fig. 10 A distribution of experimental plates on fixed chute surface [3] 
Plates made of 18G2A with padding welt undergo replacement after about 50% 
of wear (a loss of operating properties). Plates made of Hardox steel may be used 
up to total wear and still they keep their mechanical properties. Because of an 
uniform wear, Hardox plates enable more effective usage. Welding of plates 
during their fixing causes increased wearing on edges. This disadvantage can be 
eliminated by fixing a plate by bolts and cutting them by a high-energetic water 
jet. Hardox plates visibly better receive and dampen dynamic loads coming from 
an output. This may result in decrease of loadings on excavator’s body. The costs 
analysis of considered plates showed that the usage of Hardox may result in 
several dozen reduction of costs of fixed chute operation than 18G2A.

Summary 
Undoubted achievement of research undertaken by Polish entrepreneurs and 
researchers is the “lifetime” extension of machines that have been in motion for 
more than 30 years. The adverse situation in which Polish brown coal open pit 
mines have found in due to geological conditions, has become an incentive to the 
development in designing of structures, their operating and diagnostics as well as 
in material research. These issues, of course, are still developed and implemented 
in practise.

Abstract. Bucket wheel excavators are machines that on the current level of sur-
face mining development have gained the widest application. Its work consists of 
the main movements (slewing of the bucket wheel and superstructure) and auxil-
iary movements (moving of the excavator toward advance direction and modifica-
tion of the height position for the bucket wheel in the vertical plane). 
The support of the bucket wheel (bucket wheel boom) is the most loaded part 
of the excavator structure participating with 6 to 13% to the complete excavator 
weight. Depending on the soil-mechanic properties of the deposit, as well as min-
ing technology, it is selected the optimal parameters of the excavator and therefore 
the required boom length, of course with the optimization of economic indicators.  
This paper provides comparative analysis of the BW boom length influence on 
the technical parameters of the block as well as on the capacity of different types 
of excavators.

Introduction 
Block parameters of the bucket wheel excavator depend on its size and vice versa 
- the required parameters of the site cause the size of the bucket wheel excavator. 
In other words, on the parameters of the site a large impact has bucket wheel 
boom structure, and bucket wheel boom structure to the overall design and weight 
of the bucket wheel excavator. Bucket wheel excavator without moving of the 
bucket wheel boom excavates face slope of the site through the operation of ma-
chine transport in the longitudinal direction, and side slope by reducing the slew-
ing angle in the lower subbenches/cuts. 
Together with the bucket wheel, the bucket wheel boom represents the operat-
ing element of the bucket wheel excavator. Heavy loads of the boom by dynamic 
and static forces, as well as its own mechanism and devices weight make it ex-
tremely loaded structure with the complex stress conditions of high value. It can 
be said that boom is the most loaded part of the bucket wheel excavator, and there-
fore during design and construction of the bucket wheel excavator it should been 
seek optimization for this part.

Supporting structure of the boom should transfer all forces occurring (during 
operation, transportation, and state of rest) to the central structure of excavators. 
The shape of the supporting structure is to aligned with the direction of load action 
and to the requirements of the technological parameters of the excavator, too. 
Great influence on the shape of the boom structure has disposition of the bucket 
wheel with drive aggregates and transfer point. The main boom structure must be 
designed to allow the installation of auxiliary structures taking into account the 
free space between parts being in the interrelated movements. In addition to these 
requirements, the structure must be suitable for carrying out maintenance opera-
tions often carried out on the drive mechanisms, components, and installations. 
Type of the designed boom structure depends primarily on the excavator sizes, 
and therefore the boom type. There are applied two types of structures: 
− 
Boom structures in the form of solid walls (usually on larger sizes 
and weights of excavators). 
− 
Boom structures in the form of spatial lattice structure (usually on 
larger sizes and weights of excavators). 
Crossing part of the structure, boom bearing to the central pillar, is arranged by 
specially shaped sheet metal girders, box-section for both types of booms. In the 
box-girders are embedding boom bearings through which all loads are transferred 
to the central pillar. Part of the boom in the area of the bucket wheel is specially 
shaped depending on the bucket wheel location and its aggregates. 
The material from which boom is made should have the following basic charac-
teristics: high tensile strength, high yield strength, high resistance to brittle frac-
ture, good weldability, and affordable price. The modern designed excavators 
have the following design features: 
• The main structure material is steel S 355 J2 +N; 
• The structure is carried out by welding technology; 
• Only the main node points are carried out by screws, unregulated with a 
high-tensile force (HV); 
• Application of other connecting ways is present to a much smaller extent. 
1.1 
Length of the Bucket Wheel Support (Bucket Wheel 
Excavator Boom) 
Boom length is selected according to the technological requirements of mining 
deposit, and must be consistent with the structural possibilities for this type of ma-
chine. Anticipated mining technology is a starting point in the design of excava-
tors, and thus determines the length of the boom. Only well-designed excavator 
with the optimal selection of mining technology, i.e. in compliance with the soil-
mechanical and geological characteristics of the deposit, can provide full effects in 
the exploitation. 
Physical-mechanical properties of the material to be excavated with the geo-
logical features of the deposit determine the optimal type of excavator for this

deposit, i.e. its technical characteristics. Knowledge of the mentioned properties of 
materials to be excavated is essential due to the bench maximum height, where 
slopes are stable. Slope stability (face and side) is provided in two basic ways: 
with lower benches and smaller angles of slopes inclination. Hydro-geological 
characteristics of the deposit, the water bearing degree and working plane capacity 
are directly related to the size of the transport mechanism. Based on the mining 
technology requirements complying with the soil-mechanical properties of the de-
posit create conditions for the selection of optimal parameters for excavators, and 
thus determine the required length of the boom. Designing implementation of the 
excavator requires in most cases compromised solutions between the demands of 
mining technology and machine technical capabilities, of course, with the optimi-
zation of economic indicators. 
Designing performance of the excavator, that is, implementation of single de-
vices is closely related to the length of the boom. Boom length is in specific pro-
portion with the following parameters: bucket wheel diameter, location of devices 
and aggregates installed on the boom, height of the suspension point of the boom 
from the working plane, the boom cross-section and size of travelling device. 
Capacity of the bucket wheel, as already noted, is in a function of its diameter. 
Correlation ratio between the bucket wheel diameter and boom length is a function 
of the excavator type. Namely, by the intensive development of compact excava-
tors in the last decades it is possible to divide it into two basic types of excavators, 
as follow: compact excavators, whose main characteristics are reflected in the 
small height range, short boom, the low drive weight, and high capacity compared 
to the so-called classical structures of excavators. 
Important structural differences between these two types of excavators can be 
best noted in correlation between the bucket wheel diameter and boom length. 
Based on the statistical processing of 18 models of compact excavators (Krupp  
6, O&K 6, Demag 1 and Takraf 5 pcs.), with capacity of Qmin = 1250 m3/h to  
Qmax = 7500 m3/h, it is evident the following ratios between bucket wheel diameter 
and the length of the boom (Table 1).

At classical structures ofexcavators (statistically treated) larger number of ex-
cavators manufactured Krupp, O&K and Takraf), ratio of boom length and bucket 
wheel diameter is different (Table 2). 
On the basis of this comparative review it may be conclude that ratio of boom 
lengths and bucket wheel diameter range in a wide scope from Ls = (1.5 – 4.55) ⋅ 
D. The above ratio depends on the structural excavator type and level of bucket 
wheel and boom adjustment to the working environment. 
Disposition of the bucket wheel drive, transferring point and location of con-
veyors in the boom structure are elements on which free cutting angles of excava-
tor depend. The above angles are dependent on the boom length, where by the  
increase in the length are created more favourable values for these angles, being 
discussed with more details in the fifth Chapter. 
Cross-section of the boom depends on its length and the installed drive power 
for the superstructure slewing movement. Expected loads in the horizontal and 
vertical planes are the starting points for designing the boom cross-section and are 
directly related to its length. Booms on excavators excavating materials of low 
strength and low density are with smaller cross-section, that is, have a greater 
slenderness than excavators provided for solid materials, which is particularly evi-
dent on the dumping bucket wheel excavators. Namely, these combined machines 
excavate, to be more precise, load already loose material from the stockyard, 
which provides a very low resistance to digging. 
1.2 
Bucket Wheel Influence to the Total Structure and Weight of 
the Bucket Wheel Excavator 
Support length, i.e. bucket wheel boom depends on: 
- 
Excavator designing scheme: structure of the bucket wheel boom with shift-
ing or without shifting, the bucket wheel diameter and angle of its equipment 
arrangement, the height of the joint fixing for the bucket wheel boom suspen-
sion and its location relative to the axis of the excavator slewing, the 
size/length of the articulated joint feed (if in question is bucket wheel boom 
with shifting capability), cross-sectional radius of the boom and its location 
relative to the boom, weight of transported material, the height of transport 
device parts forward positions out of the turntable; 
- 
The set of technology and physical and mechanical working conditions: 
type and composition of rocks/material, the digging height (during exca-
vation in horizontal or vertical cuts), digging depth, angles of benches, 
face and subbenches site. 
 
The main initial conditions are height and digging depth, position of the boom 
suspension joint, transport device size, bucket wheel diameter and soil conditions. 
All other conditions are in the some extent determined based on initial or can be 
corrected during design process. Stable factor, which practically is not modified 
due to the technology and machines structure, is the limit angle of the belt con-
veyor inclination on the bucket wheel boom. Boom length as well as the bucket

wheel diameter significantly affect the weight of the excavator, and even more, if 
excavator is larger, that is, larger type (higher capacity) and higher capacity (Fig-
ure 1). Boom of normal size (for a given size of the excavator), the slope of the 
tangent for curve Qteor is, according to data by NKMZ, approx. 30-50o (more for 
larger capacity of excavators, that is, power, i.e. larger type). 
Qteor = 12500 m3/h

Influential Factors on the Bucket Wheel Excavator 
Capacity in the Function of the Boom Length 
Factors that affect the excavator capacity can be divided into two basic groups: 
− 
Factors that limit technical capabilities of the excavator by  
capacity, 
− 
Factors that cause delays of the excavator and its utilisation by 
the time. 

78 
D. Ignjatović et al.
 
 
Capacity of the excavator can be significantly limited by technological excavation 
conditions. Maximum level of bucket wheel excavator capacities at the height bench 
excavation at a given height and angle of bench inclination is achieved during block 
excavation, determined by the bucket wheel boom slewing to the side slope and the 
highest subbench for 800, according to the excavated area within the lowest subbench 
for 300. During the block parameters reducing cause reduction of capacity, and fur-
ther a reduction of operation efficiency within the block, as it reduces the effective 
time of excavation, and increase delays in the framework of the operation (changing 
of the subbench, block change, etc.). The reduction is particularly important during 
reducing of the block width and during the height and cuts thickness reducing. 
Beside the main technological conditions that affect capacity (width of the 
block, block height) boom length directly affects the length of excavation within a 
single subbench thus reducing the non-productive operations in the block, the 
length of the boom directly affects the possibility of obtaining the angle of slope 
inclination being excavated, which is very important for the safe operation of ex-
cavators, as well as the concentration of mining operations. 
Figure 2 shows dependence of the block width for three different types of exca-
vators operating in the MB Kolubara - C 700 (compact excavator type A and 
boom length of 14.5 m), the standard excavator SchRs 630 type B and boom 
length of 35 meters) and excavator type C SRs 2000 with boom length of 44 me-
ters. For the each excavator on the diagram is shown variation in the function of 
the boom length (increasing and decreasing of the boom length). The figure 
clearly indicates an increasing in the block width, and therefore the possibility of 
achieving greater efficiency in the block. Greater block width reduces the amount 
of auxiliary operations on the shifting of conveyors.

Figure 3 shows dependence of the advance direction within one subbench for 
different boom lengths and block heights. The figure also shows an increasing in 
the length of excavation within one subbench, which creates the possibility of 
achieving greater efficiency in the block. Larger advance direction within one 
subbench reduces scope of operation for auxiliary machinery on smoothing the 
plane and involvement with the bucket wheel excavators.

Figure 4 shows dependence of the possibilities in achieving inclination angle of 
the side slope for the different boom lengths and block heights. Possibility to cre-
ate more smooth inclination angles of the side slopes is achieved by increasing the 
boom length, being very important for the stability of slopes.

The above-mentioned technological benefits of excavators with longer booms 
affect the efficiency operation increasing in the block (Figure 5), therefore de-
pending on the excavator efficiency height with longer booms it is around 80%, 
while for compact excavators with short boom it is up to 70%.

Fig. 5 Block efficiency dependence on the boom lengths for the various types of excavators 
Undoubtedly, from all figures it can be seen advantage of excavator techno-
logical opportunities in function of boom length increasing. However, it should be 
considered the graphical illustration on Figure 1, which shows an increase in 
weight of excavators and therefore the purchase price of excavators in function of 
the boom length. Due to it, it is necessary to perform optimisation of the boom 
length in the function of the working conditions prevailing in actual opencast 
mine. 
Researching the impact of the boom length on the efficiency [4] has prove that 
for the increasing of the block efficiency of +6%, it is required an extension of the 
bucket wheel boom from 35m to 40m based on the angle of slope of 45° and ex-
cavation height of 25m. This leads to an increase in device weight of about 15%. 
Further extension of the bucket wheel boom for an additional 5 meters (45m) 
causes only an increase of about 1.5% in the efficiency of the block. However, it 
requires a tremendous increase in the total weight of even +25%. This example 
shows that an increase in the length of the bucket wheel boom cannot be taken in-
definitely. 
In order to perform a proper selection of the boom length, it is required to carry 
out detailed techno-economic analysis which would for the each actual opencast 
mine should be based on the geotechnical parameters of the working environment 
for determination the optimal length of the boom and the concept of the bucket 
wheel excavator.

Conclusion 
Length of bucket wheel boom has a crucial impact on the effectiveness of the ex-
cavator operations that is the length of the bucket wheel boom as the main factor

affecting the efficiency of the excavator operations, i.e. its effective capacity. This 
relates to the standard operation and in particular to the selective mining.  
The overall height and width of the block to be mined, and the block length de-
pend on the length of the bucket wheel boom. The longer the bucket wheel boom 
is the better is operation efficiency in the block and actual capacity of the excava-
tor. However, it should be noted that up to a certain value, efficiency is growing 
faster and then increasing the boom length does not significantly affect on the ef-
ficiency increasing, but significantly affects the width and therefore the purchase 
price of the excavator. 
Further advantages of larger bucket wheel boom are as follows: 
- 
Suitability for selective mining  
- 
A small inclination of the belt on the bucket wheel boom in operation and 
in upper subbenches  
- 
Reducing of interval for shifting of conveyors  
- 
Larger depth of operation below the level of crawlers, provides greater 
flexibility during selective operations  
- 
Optimization of ratio Qth/Qeff, due to better efficiency reduces the re-
quired width of the belt and the required speed of other the equipment in 
the system. 
In order to perform a proper selection of the boom length, it is required to carry 
out detailed techno-economic analysis which would for the each actual opencast 
mine should be based on the geotechnical parameters of the working environment 
for determination the optimal length of the boom and the concept of the bucket 
wheel excavator.

Abstract. The definition of technological complexes of opencast mining is given. 
Their systemization is done. It shows that in the open cast mining are used the 
following technological complexes (TC). 
Simple systems complexes: excavator, bulldozer, scraper, drainage and hydro-
mechanized technological complexes. At these TC the excavation and movement 
of rock mass is realized by a single machine.  
Two-component complexes: excavator-rail, excavator-automobile, excavator-
conveyor, excavator-console, excavator-dump-bridge technological complexes. At 
these TC the excavation and loading of mining mass is produced by one machine - 
an excavator (shovel, bucket wheel, chain), and its transportation is carried out by 
another machine (different type of transport). 
Three-component complexes: excavator-automobile-rail, excavator-automobile-
conveyor,

and loading of mining mass is produced by one machine (excavator), and its 
transportation is realized by two types of transport.Examples of their implementation 
in the quarries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are given. The comptetive of the three-
component technological complexes of deep pits is proved.

Statement of the Question 
The following definitions of the basic concepts of geotechnology are used [1,2]. 
Mining technology - a set of methods and techniques of the mechanized 
implementation of mining processes to extract mineral resources of the required 
volume and given quality from the Earth crust. 
Technology of stripping and mining operations - a combination of techniques 
and methods of excavation, loading and movement of overburden and minerals 
from the quarry to the destination.

Technology of opencast mining - a collection of excavation and loading and 
transport operations technologies and technical means of their implementation. 
In accordance with this definition, the structure of the technological complex 
(TC) of opencast mining can be represented as shown in Figure 1. 
If technology excavation and loading and transport operations predetermined 
by geological conditions of occurrence of mineral deposits and displacement 
character of mining workings in quarry field, the mechanical equipments are 
intended  to provide productive and quality execution. It requires a high-
performance means of mechanization in each process, their reliability and 
durability in operation. Reasonable selection of means of mechanization of the 
main processes relevant to each other in performance, size and parameters of 
design subsystems ensures consistent, reliable operation of the technological 
complex the opencast mining [1-3].

Four elements of TC combining by the functions perform two components of 
complex: excavation and loading and transport (see Figure 1.). 
In the excavation and the loading component as a means of mechanization used 
machines by cyclic: hydraulic excavators, mechanical shovels, draglines, scrapers, 
bulldozers, shovel loaders; and continuous machine: bucket-wheel and chain 
excavators, milling machines, hydromechanization tools - hydromonitors, floating 
suction dredger, dredge, etc. 
In the transport component as a means of mechanization used cyclical 
transport: railway, automobile transport, diesel and trolley cars, lifting devices and 
continuous machines: conveyors, belt console; conveyor bridges, means of 
gravitational and hydraulic transport and cable-suspended road. 
According to the number of the components, technological complexes of 
opencast mining can be divided into single-, two-and three-component. They may 
be referred to the name of the participating machines, such as excavating complex 
excavator-conveyor complex etc. Detailed systematic of the TC is shown in Fig. 2.

Simple systems complexes include: excavator, bulldozer, scraper, drainage and 
hydro-mechanized technological complexes. At these TC the excavation and 
movement of rock mass is realized by a single machine. Huge stripping excavators 
and draglines move the overburden into mined-out space, bulldozers and scrapers 
deliver to the destination. Dranaige and hydromechanized complexes also 
combined these processes. 
Two-component complexes can be: excavator-rail, excavator-automobile, 
excavator-conveyor, excavator-console, excavator-dump-bridge technological 
complexes. At these TC the excavation and loading of mining mass is produced by 
one machine - an excavator (shovel, bucket wheel, chain), and its transportation is 
carried out by another machine (different type of transport). 
Three-component complexes: excavator-automobile-rail, excavator-automobile-

excavator-automobile-crate, 
excavator-
automobile-of-different-types technological complexes. At these TC the excavation 
and loading of mining mass is produced by one machine (excavator), and its 
transportation is realized by two types of transport.
It may be several types of TC in 
the pit. They are divided into TC of stripping and mining operations by type of 
rock mass produced.  
Structure of the technological complexes are different depending on the content of the 
components. Transport component may be different at the same excavation and loading 
component.

Interconnection of Technological Systems with Mining 
Technology 
Technological complexes are integral part of mining technology, they are 
instrument of its implementation. They serve technology of stripping and mining 
operations. They divide into cyclical, cyclic-stream and stream technology of 
mining (overburden and mining) activities by the nature of the recess and rocks 
moving (Fig. 5).

Excavation-loading and transport operations are done by cyclic equipment in 
cyclic technology (LM CA and TM CA). In cyclic-stream technology excavation-
loading works are done by cyclic equipment (LM CA) and transport operations are 
done by continuous equipment (TM SA) or excavation-loading works are done by 
continuous equipment (LM SA) and transport operations are done by cyclic 
equipment (TM CA). Both of the works are done by continuous equipment in 
stream technology (LM CA and TM CA). 
For example excavator-rail and excavator-automobile complexes are used in cyclic 
technology, excavator-automobile-conveyor – in cyclic-stream technology, and 
bucket-wheal-excavator-conveyor complex, complexes with consoles and dump-
bridges – in stream technology.  
The most high-level mode of production is stream technology of mining and 
stripping works. The next level of production represents by cyclic-flow technology 
mining. This technique is quite effective and more promising. Cyclical mining 
technology is the commonest [3].  
Bucket-wheel-excavator-conveyor complex of mining works, which implements 
stream technology of coal extraction, has been introduced in “Bogatyr” quarry in 
Kazakhstan. The annual production capacity is 50 million tones [4].  
Bucket-wheel-excavator-conveyor complex of mining works are successfully 
operating in “Vostochnyi” quarry of Ekibastuz coal deposits. Excavation, 
transportation, averaging and movement of coal is made by complex, which includes 
bucket-wheel excavator SRs (k) -2000, face and bench cranes, connecting, lifting 
and trunk conveyors, averaging-loading machine and loading point [4]. 
Also excavator-automobile-conveyor technological complex is used in cyclic-
stream technology in the quarry. Its reliability is ensured by two excavator-
automobile complexes located on the flanks of the quarry with same crushing and 
transfer points. 
Excavator-automobile-conveyor technological complex of mining works 
introduced in pit of  JSC “Altyntau” [5]. Crushing-reloading setting СJ615 provides 
reception and crushing of ore mass, which is then transported by conveyor to gold

factory. 
Cyclic-stream technology also will be used in projects of opencast mining of 
large copper-molybdenum deposits in Kazakhstan, such as Aktogai, Bozshakol, and 
in Kacharsk iron deposits. 
The unique project is project "Creation and implementation of cycle-stream 
transport (CLT) with steeply inclined conveyor KNK-270's in mine " Muruntau" of 
Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combine of Uzbekistan, which has been performed 
by the Uzbek and Ukrainian scientists and specialists [6]. 
CLT of ore includes: CLP - crushing and reloading point; KNK-270 - steeply 
inclined conveyor; CWH - cargo warehouse; Asmodeus - automated system of 
monitoring and supervisory control (see Figure 6). 
The developed design of steeply inclined conveyor with presser belt showed 
high performance and reliability, and provides stable reception, climbing at an 
angle of 37 degrees to a height of 270 m and unloading of crushed rock mass with 
a capacity of more than 3500 t/h.

Trail of steeply inclined conveyor is situated perpendicular to general angle of

According to the authors [6] complex KNK-270 will increase the depth of the 
mine development to 950 m. 
Nowadays 
excavator-different-type-automobile 
technological 
systems 
successfully operates in medium and large quarries, which implement the cyclic 
technology. Their competitiveness may increase if depth of quarry is used by 
zones [5,7 ]. For example, it is advisable to share quarries space into two zones by 
height in deep quarries (H = 480 m) with annual volume more than 80 million 
tons. It needs to use excavators with bucket capacity of 10-20 m3 and dump trucks 
with payload 90-200 t in the upper zone and excavators with bucket capacity of  
5-10 m3 and dump trucks with payload 45-90 t in the lower zone.

It is necessary to divide quarry space into three zones by height in ultra-deep 
pits (H = 600 m) with an annual traffic volume more than 100 million tons. It 
needs to use excavators with bucket capacity of 20-32 m3 and dump trucks with 
payload 200-320 t in the middle zone, excavators with bucket capacity of 10-20 
m3 and dump trucks with payload 90-200 t in the middle zone and excavators with 
bucket capacity of 5-10 m3 and dump trucks with payload 45-90 t in the lower 
zone. 
Thus, the three-technological complexes, accompanying as cyclic, and cyclic-
stream technology development are quite effective.

The Inden Residual Lake and the Federal 
Autobahn A44n – Geotechnical Requirements  
to Be Met by Large-Scale Structures  
in the Rhenish Lignite Mining Area 
Gero Vinzelberg and Dieter Dahmen 
RWE Power AG 
Abstract. The geotechnical requirements of two major structures in the Rhenish 
lignite mining area will be discussed – the Inden residual lake and the federal 
autobahn A44n. 
According to current planning, the Inden residual lake is going to be the first of 
three large residual lakes to be filled from about 2030 onwards when coal 
extraction at the Inden opencast mine comes to an end. However, the construction 
of the lakes’ final slopes will start as soon as 2014. Compared to the existing man-
made lakes in the Rhenish lignite mining area, with the largest being the 100-
hectare large Blausteinsee, the area of the Inden residual lake will cover 
approximately 1,100 hectares and thus become the largest lake in North-Rhine 
Westphalia. Consequently, geotechnical aspects such as material distribution in 
the slopes have to be considered carefully and overall stability of single slopes as 
well as the slope system has to be ensured. Furthermore, the influence of waves, 
erosion and earthquakes on the overall stability will be discussed. A focus will be 
on additional loads caused by earthquakes that play an important role due to the 
fact that the Lower Rhine Embayment is one of the most active earthquake areas 
in Germany. 
The second project presented here is the construction of the federal autobahn 
A44n. The A61 between the Jackerath and Wanlo interchanges will be 
decommissioned due to the progress made by the Garzweiler opencast mine. By 
then, the new autobahn A44n has to be commissioned in order to replace the 
above-mentioned A61 and the former autobahn A44 that had to make way for 
mining in 2006. More than 7 km of the new A44n including several bridges will 
be located on dumped soil with a thickness of up to 190 m. Geotechnical aspects 
including settlement forecasts and field measurements will be presented. 
Furthermore, this paper outlines measures to offset settlements including a so-
called precautionary gradient as well as material distribution beneath the 
autobahn. Finally, soil improvement measures beneath a bridge with a clear span 
of over 100 m will be discussed.

The Inden Residual Lake 
1 
Introduction 
The Inden opencast mine is located in the western part of the Rhenish lignite 
mining area and – at a planned annual coal output of about 20 million tons – will 
be depleted around the year 2030. An opencast mine residual lake covering about 
1,100 hectares, filled over a period of 20 to 25 years, is to be created in order to 
offset the deficit in volume resulting from many years of coal extraction. Apart 
from sump water, the lake will mainly be filled with water taken from the Rur 
River situated to the north-east. Although the Rhenish lignite mining area has 
already seen the creation of numerous residual and other man-made lakes that are 
now used for a variety of purposes, the Inden residual lake, owing to its surface 
area and volume, will be on an entirely different scale. As early as the planning 
stage, issues of stability and resistance to erosion were thus explored in depth with 
the aid of scientific evaluations and the lakes already in existence were examined. 
2 
Underlying Conditions for Dimensioning 
Initial studies on the possible creation of a residual lake were conducted as early 
as 1984; the assumption at the time being that the lake would be flooded by means 
of the rising groundwater table. In addition to the disadvantage of a very long 
filling process, this procedure would have led to an uneconomic general 
inclination of the residual lake’s slopes; consequently, the mining authority 
declined its approval on account of the objectives of the lignite mining plan. At 
the time it was instead decided to fill the Inden residual lake with overburden 
masses extracted from the neighbouring Hambach opencast mine. This plan was 
challenged by the Inden township in 2000, and the creation of a residual lake as an 
alternative reviewed. Following the revision of and amendments to the lignite 
mining plan, the master operating plan was approved on 20 December 2012 [1]. 
Concurrently with the procedure under approval law, basic investigations into the 
dimensioning of the planned residual lake were carried out. These investigations 
are summarised in the following. 
In an attempt to both allow for the deposit to be exploited – which is an 
economic imperative – and ensure sufficient stability of the permanent residual-
lake slope system, the initial plan is to deplete the deposit, setting up a border 
slope system inclined at 1:3 as the mine advances. Subsequently, a wedge-shaped 
fill with a general inclination of 1:5 will be banked up in front of the dump, 
resulting in a lake area of about 1,100 hectares. According to current plans, this 
slope system will consist of single slopes inclined at 1:2.5 and intermediate 
horizontal berms functioning as working levels for the spreaders. An underwater 
slope inclined at 1:5 and a wave attack zone border on the top berm. Depending on 
the level difference to the surrounding terrain, some areas above the wave attack 

The Inden Residual Lake and the Federal Autobahn A44n 
93 
 
zone are abutted by a surface slope with an inclination of 1:3. The general layout 
of the planned residual lake is shown in Figure 1. 
To guarantee slope stability and controlled filling, the residual lake is to be 
flooded with outside water supplied by the Rur River to the north-east of the lake 
and by drainage operations at the Hambach opencast mine. The ongoing, selective 
operation of dewatering wells in the vicinity of the lake ensures that the lake’s 
water level remains above the surrounding rock water level, enabling stabilising 
forces to act on the slopes. 
The shape of the future wave attack zone is mainly determined by waves 
formed by wind. The wind velocities and fetch encountered in the surroundings as 
well as the contours of the lake shore have the greatest effect on the height of 
these waves. All of these factors were analysed by experts. Based on the 
maximum wave height to be expected (1 m) and the materials available in the 
opencast mine, a required “wave attack zone” inclination of 1:20 in the prevailing 
wind direction was established and, to be on the safe side, was transferred to the 
entire wave attack zone around the lake. 
Since the Lower Rhine Embayment is one of the most active seismic areas in 
Germany [2], the stability of the residual lake slopes must also be guaranteed in 
the case of an earthquake. Both deterministic and probabilistic approaches can be 
taken to ascertain the ground acceleration caused by earthquakes; more 
information on how earthquakes are considered is given under the point “Stability 
analyses”. In addition, we carried out investigations to determine whether the 
creation of a residual lake would affect the region’s seismic activity within the 
scope of the approval procedure. As it turned out, the creation of the lake would 
lead to only a very minor relief of stress on the terrestrial crust that would not alter 
natural seismicity to such a degree as to put the shore or slopes at risk. 
Triggered especially by the incident that occurred in Nachterstedt in 2009, 
when part of the dump of the Concordia lake failed, entailing a massive landslide, 
a renewed detailed analysis of the experience gathered in the Rhenish mining area 
up to now with the creation of residual and other man-made lakes as well as high 
dumps was performed as part of an assessment for monitoring purposes and 
described in [3]: “In stability terms, the examined lakes show no abnormalities. In 
two objects, there were minor slope deformations in the past. These concern the 
13-ha Neurather See lake on whose shores a deformation surface measuring some 
900 m² occurred in the wake of the 1992 Roermond earthquake. No remediation 
was necessary. Likewise, there was local deformation during the filling phase of 
the 85-ha Zülpicher See lake, which was remediated at short notice. At no point in 
time were material goods or people in danger from these two events. (…). In order 
to find out how the lake troughs profiled in dumping operations behave below the 
water surface, two exemplary sonar measurements were taken in the western 
mining area. Lakes Lucherberger See and Blausteinsee were selected as objects. 
With a surface measuring some 100 ha and a max depth of 41 m, Blausteinsee is 
the biggest and one of the youngest opencast-pit lakes in the Rhenish mining area. 
(…). A comparison of the sonar measurements with the underlying planning and 

94 
G. Vinzelberg and D. Dahmen
 
the mapping system after completion of the lake troughs shows no abnormalities 
(Figure 2). Minor changes in the range of a few decimetres to the lake contour of 
Lucherberger See are mainly due to organic sedimentation at deep points, 
according to specialist interpretation of the measurement results. These 
phenomena are above all due to the lake’s age and not unusual for standing 
waters.”

Stability Analyses 
The “Guideline for Stability Analyses” (RfS) governs the conducting of stability 
analyses in the Rhenish lignite mining area. In its 2003 version already, the 
guideline requests an adequate consideration of earthquakes. Planning bulletins 
issued in 2006 and 2008 consequently made allowance for earthquakes that might 
occur in the various sections around the future residual lake. The following 
sections were examined (Table, Figure 1):

The planning bulletins were subsequently reviewed on behalf of the mining 
authority by experts of the Geological Service NRW who checked calculations, 
performed their own calculations and evaluated the bulletins within a report 
produced for the Arnsberg regional government. Taking account of the planning 
bulletins of the mining company and the opinion of the Geological Service, the 
Arnsberg regional government conducted a final check verified by an inspection 
report included in the documentation of the environmental impact assessment that 
followed. The report confirmed that geomechanical feasibility and the required 
stability will be assured at all stages: when depleted, during filling and in the final, 
filled state. The approach taken at the time pseudo-statically factored in 
earthquakes by assuming part of the seismic acceleration to be expected as 
permanent additional acceleration in the horizontal plane of up to 0.5 m/s². 
In 2013, the RfS Guideline mentioned above was again updated and the 
consideration of earthquakes further defined by taking the advancement of 
geotechnical standards and bulletins into account. Specifically, this applies to DIN 
19700 [4] and NRW bulletin No. 58 [5], which deal with the dimensioning of 
barrages. Accordingly, a probabilistic approach which, in the style of the 
mentioned standards and by way of simplification, assumes earthquakes with a 
recurrence period of 500 years for the filling phase and earthquakes with a 
recurrence period of 2,500 years for the final, filled state was inter alia specified 
for determining the ground acceleration to be expected. In this way, a safety level 

The Inden Residual Lake and the Federal Autobahn A44n 
95 
 
in the filled sate similar to retaining structures of major Class-1 reservoirs is taken 
as a basis although, unlike with reservoirs, no neighbours are at risk below the 
lake’s water level. According to the RfS, the ground acceleration to be assumed 
can be ascertained inter alia by submitting a location-specific earthquake-risk data 
query to the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ Potsdam). This 
ensures a transparent procedure since the relevant data is available to everyone 
[6]. For the Inden residual lake this approach pursuant to the current RfS yields a 
maximum ground acceleration of between 1.06 m/s² for the filling phase and 
2.10 m/s² for the final, filled state. When this maximum acceleration is factored 
into pseudo-static stability calculations it is treated as a long-term parameter and 
converted using pseudo-static coefficients. The pseudo-static coefficients were 
determined by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s Soil and Rock Mechanics 
Department in connection with an evaluation commissioned by the Arnsberg 
regional government [7] by means of a dynamic comparative calculation on the 
basis of time-acceleration curves derived from recorded earthquakes and 
ascertained within the scope of an evaluation [8] prepared by Cologne 
University’s Department of Earthquake Geology. Taking the values calculated in 
these evaluations as a basis and depending on the location of the examined rupture 
mechanisms, the result is horizontal acceleration of between 0.11 m/s² and 
0.53 m/s², which is factored into the stability calculations as additional load acting 
on the slopes. Thus, the results from the above-mentioned stability calculations 
performed in accordance with the 2003 RfS were essentially verified.

Federal Autobahn A44n 
4.1 
Introduction 
The Garzweiler II opencast mine interferes with the federal network of trunk roads 
encompassing the autobahn A44 and the autobahn A61, which are situated in the 
extraction area of the opencast mine. To replace the stretch of the A44 between 
the Jackerath and Holz interchanges that had to make way for mining in 2006, the 
A61 between the Jackerath and Wanlo interchanges was expanded to six lanes and 
the Wanlo junction was built as a replacement for the Otzenrath (A44) junction by 
way of a preliminary measure. 
In the course of the mine’s further development, the six-lane autobahn A61 will 
be reached by advancing mining operations and interrupted. By this time, the A44 
will be re-constructed and widened to six lanes to replace the A61 over a distance 
of 10 km. In accordance with the specifications set forth in the requirement plan 
for federal trunk roads, this stretch of motorway will also be complemented by the 
six-lane expansion of the A46 between the Holz and Wanlo interchanges 
(Figure 3).  
More than seven kilometres of the A44n will be located on dumped soil with a 
thickness of up to 190 m extracted from the Garzweiler opencast mine. Apart from 

96 
G. Vinzelberg and D. Dahmen
 
the autobahn proper, which is a six-lane road, several bridge structures will be 
erected on dumped terrain. Although the construction of roads and motorways 
(A540) on dumped soil is state of the art in the Rhenish mining area, the building 
of the A44n is extensively supervised by engineers and scientists on account of the 
considerable dump thickness, the tight schedule and the autobahn length. 
5 
Geotechnical Specifics 
Unlike the procedure that is usual followed when building a motorway on existing 
terrain, where geotechnical soil examinations are a crucial basis for planning, the 
construction of the A44 n is special in that an area measuring more than three 
kilometres has yet to be dumped, meaning that until now no soil examinations 
have been carried out. To deal with this situation, a pinpointed dumping scheme 
that predetermines the structure of the subgrade while simultaneously reducing 
settlements is applied (Figure 4). The fine-grained and loose in-situ soils are 
combined into mixed soil classes and there is a significant reduction in the 
structure’s cohesive proportions from bottom to top. Specifically the top layer of 
10-m thick gravel is well-graded, which on the one hand allows any compaction 
measures to be successfully implemented and on the other ensures sufficient 
percolation capacity to permit road drainage along the central reservation and hard 
shoulders. To enable the exact elevation to be reached, earthworking equipment 
places a sand/gravel layer on top of the unfinished dump produced in opencast 
mining operations with main mine equipment. This layer serves as formation for 
the motorway surfacing, i.e. it has to reach Ev2 values of 45 MN/m². 
Apart from the materials used, the settlements occurring naturally in dump 
areas are influenced mainly by the thickness and life of the dump. In total, these 
settlements will be in the order of nearly two metres. Accordingly, when the 
autobahn is completed, the thickest areas dumped the latest will be subject to the 
greatest settlements yet to be expected (Figure 5). The fact that the settlements 
vary along the length of the autobahn and before and after commissioning is 
accounted for by a so-called precautionary gradient. This means that the different 
areas of the autobahn are built at a higher level than officially approved in order to 
ensure that the alignment in elevation complies with the relevant guidelines both 
when the autobahn is opened and after the subsequent settlements have subsided. 
6 
Mine Surveying Settlement Measurements  
and Soil-Mechanical Model 
As mentioned above, settlement forecasts are of paramount importance in the 
construction of motorways. The stretches of autobahn that have already been built 
are measured by mine surveying methods for the purpose of validating and, if 
necessary, adjusting the settlement forecasts. This is done by means of a tight grid 
of geodetic points that are placed at least every 50 m along both carriageways and 

The Inden Residual Lake and the Federal Autobahn A44n

in the area of the axes and refined section by section. In this way, several hundred 
geodetic points, levelled according to the dump’s life between every three months 
and every twelve months, have already been used up in building. These measuring 
points verify a semi-logarithmic/linear settlement progression and permit the 
settlement forecasts to be updated. All things considered, the targeted dump 
structure results in a reduction compared with the initial settlement forecasts, 
prepared on the basis of long-term measurement data collected in dump areas 
without the special soil structure described above. Munich Technical University 
provided scientific assistance in the way of a soil-mechanical finite-element model 
enabling settlement measurements to be simulated; if need be this model is 
spatially refined and used for settlement forecasts for bridge structures [9]. 
7 
Hydrostatic Settlement Measurements 
Hydrostatic line-measuring systems functioning on the principle of tube levels and 
permitting a 25-cm grid resolution were installed in various places so as to be able 
to monitor small-scale settlements occurring at different depths. Using these, 
settlements of the gravel layer occurring in the region of measuring field No. 1 
were examined more closely. The findings showed that the settlements within the 
gravel layer resemble the settlement behaviour of the entire dump body below the 
autobahn bed. After a life of six months, settlements affecting only a very small 
area show differences of 1 to 3 cm for wavelengths between 2 and 5 m, occurring 
below the gravel layer after another six months. 
The hydrostatic line-measuring system was also employed in the area of a 
bridge structure passing over a belt conveyor (measuring field No. 3) in order to 
record the spatial and time-dependent progression of settlements by means of a 
pre-load fill. The placing of an overload fill with a thickness of about 14 m 
allowed settlements amounting to about 30 m to be prevented in the space of four 
months. 
8 
Compaction Measures 
To analyse the compactibility of the gravel layer, a test field where small-scale 
settlement differences within the gravel layer and the effects of different 
compacting methods can be studied by means of another hydrostatic measuring 
system (measuring field No. 2) was prepared next to the actual autobahn bed at the 
end of 2011. In addition, the planned percolation scheme and the effects of 
rainwater percolation on settlement behaviour were investigated in another part of 
the test field. Figure 6 gives a schematic overview of the test field. To prevent the 
tests from having an impact on the future autobahn bed, the gravel layer to the 
right and left of the bed was widened and the test field arranged next to the bed 
proper as described above. Compaction and percolation were studied over a period 
of 1.5 months by experimenting with the vibroflotation, pulse, and roller 

98 
G. Vinzelberg and D. Dahmen
 
compaction methods. To evaluate compaction, both cone-penetration and 
dynamic-probing structural test holes were drilled all over the test field (in total 43 
for cone penetration and 38 for dynamic probing). In uncompacted condition, 
packing density in the area close to the surface, down to a depth of about 1 m, was 
medium, followed by largely loose packing down to about 6 m. Farther down, 
packing density again increases to medium, rising further as depth increases. The 
core penetration and dynamic probing tests conducted after compaction were 
assessed to evaluate the various methods used. 
In the area close to the surface, roller compaction with a heavy-duty polygonal 
roller increased packing to medium and dense. Down to a depth of 6 m, packing 
density was largely medium, with no change in compactness being noted at even 
greater depths. Pulse compaction in a 3-m grid, with an additional compaction 
point at the grid’s centre in certain areas, led to an increase in compactness to 
medium or dense down to a depth of 6 m; and while a compaction effect was still 
detectable at a depth of up to 12 m, packing density could not be increased beyond 
medium. Vibroflotation compaction was applied in 3 and 4-m grids down to a 
depth of 17 m. Down to about 6 m, the result was a heterogeneous change in 
density so that both loosening (very loose packing) and compaction (dense 
packing) of the soil were locally noted. Beyond this point down to the final depth, 
however, compactness significantly increased to medium and dense packing. 
The evaluation of the settlement measurements taken in the test field so far 
shows that the compaction methods do not affect the settlement behaviour of the 
dump, which is considerably thicker. Close to the surface, immediate settlements 
in the range of a few centimetres or decimetres were observed. To what extent 
compaction of the gravel layer can contribute to a reduction in small-scale 
settlement differences is a question that can only be answered once future line 
measurements have been appraised. On the whole, the test results attest to the 
good compactibility of the gravel layer. 
Proceeding from the aforementioned findings, we intend to compact the 
autobahn bed by means of a heavy-duty polygonal roller whereas 
vibrodisplacement columns, in addition to the preliminary fill already in place, are 
to be erected for the mentioned bridge structure situated in the area of the belt 
conveyor due to the greater depth of penetration of the structural loads. Both 
measures are supported by extensive investigations and measurements. 
Apart from the compaction tests, multi-stage percolation trials were performed 
on two of the test fields (previously compacted by polygonal roller and 
uncompacted) in surface areas measuring 252 m² and 230 m². The trials ran for 
two to six hours, with an inflow of between 10 and 70 m³/h. Relative to the 
percolation area, rainfall of approx. 280 mm/h was simulated in this way, which 
also resulted in the flooding of the basins up to a water depth of 0.5 m. With 
permeability coefficients of kf ≥ 1•10-5m/s, the requirements imposed on the 
percolation capacity of the soil have thus been met both in uncompacted and 
compacted condition. In addition, the settlement measurements taken concurrently 
show that even the highest inflow rates do not lead to further subsidence. The 
percolation scheme via the gravel layer has thus proven suitable.

Summary 
Planning for the Inden residual lake dates back to the year 1984 and is regularly 
updated on the basis of new developments for instance in geotechnics and 
seismology. Since the Inden residual lake, once created, will have a surface area 
ten times that of the largest man-made lake in the Rhenish mining area to date 
(Blausteinsee), comprehensive dimensioning and stability studies were carried out. 
Thus, the special requirements to be fulfilled by a geotechnical structure that is 
erected over several decades and which, as a permanent part of the scenery, will 
leave its mark on the region are addressed in an adequate manner. To take account 
of the special geotechnical requirements needing to be met when constructing a 
motorway on an opencast mine dump with a thickness of up to 190 m, settlement 
forecasts underpinned by extensive mine surveying settlement measurements are 
produced to ensure that the alignment in elevation complies with the relevant 
guidelines both when the autobahn is opened and after the subsequent settlements 
have subsided. Test fields prepared to conduct compaction and percolation trials 
enable specific technical and economic soil improvement measures geared to the 
different load situations in the area of the autobahn bed and bridge structures to be 
identified. 
Both major projects presented here highlight the wide range of tasks involved 
in ensuring the organised post-mine use of surfaces that had to make way for 
mining and underline the significance of geotechnics as a key process for safe and 
economic opencast mining operations.

Abstract. Development of mining in the opencast mine Drmno from Kostolac 
basin in Serbia is carried out in the increasingly complex geological and hydro-
geological conditions with the decline of the coal seams to the alluvial part of 
Europe's largest river Danube. Greater depth and inflow of groundwater 
significantly increase costs for dewatering facilities construction with the 
requirement for optimizing of this more and more important surface mining 
process. Making decision on screen construction in the opencast mine with 
redesign of line wells parameters for the defence against groundwater, in addition 
to geology and hydrogeology exploration activities, analyzing the elements of the 
opencast mining systems and a number of working environment parameters with 
the development of the hydrodynamic model requires necessary review of 
economic and environmental effects. A detailed techno-economic analysis has 
been done in order to demonstrate technological justification and economy of 
screen construction as the system for protection against groundwater in the 
opencast mine. The defence of the opencast mine against the groundwater without 
the construction of screen causes construction of several dewatering wells and 
lines with increased pumping capacities by the end of deposit mining. On the other 
hand, screen construction means big initial investments but with a smaller number 
of dewatering wells with reduced capacities, lower cost of electricity and larger 
reliability of the system operation in the long period until the closure of the 
opencast mine. Estimates of environmental impact and efficiency comparison 
between these systems options for protection against of groundwater have been 
done. DCF analysis has shown that the long-term averaged costs for opencast 
mine Drmno dewatering against groundwater per ton of coal are approximate for 
the both system options. Final decision on the approval of the combined 
dewatering system with a reduced number of dewatering wells and screen 
construction has been caused by the system reliability and environmental effects 
related to the impact on the groundwater level outside of the opencast mine 
boundaries and safer operation of the hydro power plant Djerdap system on the 
Danube River.

Introduction  
Opencast mining, especially today when mining is performed at greater depths in 
complex hydrogeological conditions, requires special attention of the scientific 
and experts community in terms of dewatering in all phases of the opencast mine 
development. Therefore, in recent decades, significant progress has been made 
primarily by developing methods, models and software that significantly 
facilitates the design of optimized groundwater dewatering system.  
From the standpoint of dewatering, opencast mines are typically very dynamic 
systems influenced by a large number of natural, technical-technological, 
economic, environmental and safety factors and constraints in all periods of the 
life cycle. The entire life cycle is defined by periods of surface mining, realized 
through a set of business processes in each of the periods that allow the efficient, 
effective and reliable mineral resources mining in the opencast mine. One of the 
key process is the process of opencast mine dewatering, which belongs to the 
group of the technical support processes for the implementation of the opening 
process, production and closing of the opencast mine, as well the reclamation 
process.  
Established dewatering process flow is at the general content level and is 
applicable regardless of the opencast mine size, the type of mineral resources 
being mined and complexity of deposit conditions. In addition, it is applicable 
during a new opencast mine opening, but also when it is required to design or 
redesign dewatering process in the opencast mine where is performed mining.  
Groundwater dewatering system is a complex of more than one dewatering 
facilities and it represents the most complex sub-process of dewatering process, to 
which is necessary to pay the greatest attention [6]. In practice, as a base, are the 
most commonly used systems of dewatering wells, dewatering channels system 
and the water collector and waterproof screens.

Dewatering Planning Process of Opencast Mines 
Successful implementation of the opencast mine protection against ground and 
surface water depends on the knowledge reliability degree of hydrological, 
hydrogeological and geotechnical characteristics of the near and distant deposit 
areas and their correct interpretation. The initial parameters for the dewatering 
requirements, in addition to these mentioned, are hydraulic and hydrodynamic 
parameters and dynamic parameters of groundwater. 
Through a detailed analysis determine data on the possible methods, systems, 
facilities and equipment for dewatering in the opencast mine. Based on these data 
and data from the deposit model, too, (hydrological, hydrogeological, hydraulic, 
geological, geophysical and geotechnical), as well as data on applied mining 
technology and the conditions of the opencast mine stability (opencast mine model 
data), is carried out dewatering system selection for the opencast mine (fig. 1). For 
sure, it has to be emphasized that for the dewatering system selection is required

for technical, economic and environmental risks to be analyzed, including the 
reliability of the system and the inputs data of the working environment.  
Selection of dewatering system is an iterative process that includes risk, 
reliability, effectiveness and efficiency analysis for the selected system. The 
process model for Opencast Mines Dewatering System Selection is shown at 
figure 1. The presented process model is the part of the overall planning procedure 
and implementation of dewatering system. It provides high quality and reliable 
performance of the dewatering process in all phases, from preliminary plans, 
through the development of investment-technical documentation up to the 
construction and operation of the dewatering system since it has flow determined 
by the process and clear procedure.

Opencast Mines Dewatering System Reliability  
Dewatering systems in opencast mines, as well as other technical systems have to 
perform its function successfully and reliably and with all its elements to serve all 
anticipated stresses, and at the same time to be simple and economical. The 
parameters of the system reliability are obtained on the basis of an analysis of 
possible system conditions related not only to the operation time and equipment 
failure but also caused by delays due to the characteristics of the working 
environment in real space, manpower and other unscheduled and planned outages 
in real time [1, 2, 7].

Functioning of dewatering system lines of wells and its elements is defined as a 
random process with exponentially distributed time of the system operational 
conditions implementation in the function of groundwater inflow in the opencast 
mine. By analyzing information on the status of dewatering systems is determined 
the strategy by which in the case of full or partial failure is performed renewal and 
scheduled servicing. Designed, implemented and controlled water screen 
permeability defines its functional reliability [4].  
Operation to failure of dewatering system elements, as continuous random size, 
can be described by different laws of distribution, depending on the characteristics 
of the system and its elements, working conditions, characters of failure, and so 
on. The simplest tested and most widely used is the exponential distribution with 
the following set operating time (t) distribution function of system elements 
operation: Po(t) = exp(-λ*t), where λ is distribution parameter (failure intensity). 
The mean operation time (to) to elements failure is 1/λ..  
On the other hand, the probability of renewal to the moment t at the exponential 
law of renewal time distribution of system elements with β parameter (renewal 
intensity) in time from 0 to t is: Pr(t) = exp(-β*t). Mean renewal time (tr) of the 
system elements is 1/β. 
3.1 
Structural Scheme of the Dewatering System Elements  
The structural schemas that represent the graphical display of elements in the 
system can unambiguously define operation or failure of the system. Elements of 
the system can be connected in series, in parallel or combined. If the system 
consists of (n) elements connected in series, the probability of the system 
operation Pos(t), for probabilities of the each element operation Poi(t), is: 
Pos(t) = P1(t)*P2(t)*,...,*Pn(t) = 
i

If the system consists of (m) elements connected in parallel, where the failure 
probability of each Prj(t) = 1-Poj(t), the probability of system failure is: 
Prs(t) = Pr1(t)*Pr2 (t)*,...,*Prm(t) =

If the structure of the system is combined, the operation probability is 
calculated with the participation of both the above-mentioned formulas. The 
combined parallel-serial systems are present in the dewatering of groundwater in 
the larger opencast mines with the complex hydrogeological conditions, when the 
single-well pumping facilities are connect as a parallel subsystem, and the water is 
re-pumped to a common serial collectors and dewatering lines.

3.2 
The Functioning of the Dewatering System 
The function of groundwater dewatering system is that at a certain time it protects 
opencast mine against a model or practically prescribed amounts of water inflow. 
During system operation it the can lead to distortion of the normal subsystems and 
elements operation, which leads to increased flow of groundwater in the opencast 
mine, and when it exceeds the permissible level to the conditional system function 
failure and mining endanger.  
A complete system failure occurs during the failure of any system connected 
elements in series, or other unforeseen failures such as, for example, electricity 
outage. Possibility of reliable dewatering system against groundwater operation, 
installed as a stationary process can be analyzed on the basis of the created graph 
with three conditions. Installed dewatering system in the function of groundwater 
inflow can be in three conditions (S0, S1, S2).  
The normal condition of the system is denoted by S0, condition S1 represents 
endanger within the permissible limits, while the condition S2 is extreme 
condition, treated as a conditional failure, when there is a threat to the functioning 
of the dewatering system in the opencast mine over the allowed limits. Then the 
system correction and active protection against groundwater leads to reduction in 
the system distortion and the possible transition from condition S2 to condition S1 
or S0 condition.  
To calculate the probability of condition P0, P1 and P2 is necessary to solve the 
corresponding system of equations with the different number of transition 
intensity probabilities between conditions S0, S1 and S2, according to the graph 
condition shown at figure 2. 
 
Fig. 2 Dewatering system graph sheet 
It is accepted simplification to solve equations by using dewatering system 
graph sheet with the rule that the each condition probability is equal to the sum of 
all flows probability being transferred from any condition in the given condition, 
reduced for the sum of all flows that from a given condition go to other conditions 
(fig. 2).  
Provided system can be in the operation condition (S0) with the transition 
intensities (a) to (S1), and (c) to (S2), the condition of operation within the 
acceptable limits (S1) with the transition intensities (e) in (S2) and (b) in the (S0) 
and the failure condition (S2) to the transition intensities (d) to (S0), and (f) to (S1).

of a chain with limit (stationary) condition probabilities by the provided formulas 
as follow:  
P0 = (1+ (a*b+f*a+f*d)/(c*f+b*c+b*e)+(a*e+d*c+d*e)/(c*f+b*c+b*e))-1   
P1 = (1+(a*e+d*c+d*e)/(a*b+f*a+f*d)+(c*f+b*c+b*e)/(a*b+f*a+f*d))-1   
P2 = (1+(c*f+b*c+b*e)/(a*e+d*c+d*e)+(a*b+f*a+f*d)/(a*e+d*c+d*e))-1  (4) 
The process of the dewatering wells system operation is random, and 
transitions from condition to condition does not depend only on the elements 
failure but also on deviations from the scheduled values. Analysis of the system 
operation probability is carried out based on the random sizes exponential 
distribution law. 
3.3 
Reliability of Dewatering System Combined Lines  
Operation in increasingly more and more complex hydrogeological deposit 
conditions and the need to reduce costs has led to the requirement for the 
significant use of optimization for new and rationalization of the existing 
combined dewatering systems in surface mining. Analysis of the dewatering 
system reliability in opencast mines on the basis of well-established information 
system can significantly ease the process of control, increase the effects of 
maintenance and to enable more cost-effective operation.  
The combined system of dewatering lines, dewatering wells with consolidating 
the flow of water can be represented by three parallel lines of wells that by pumps 
transport water to the serial subsystem consisting of a common first collecting 
pipeline, transferring point, other common gravity or pressure pipeline and 
refilling facility with operation probabilities Pc, Pv, Pp and Pr (fig. 3). Reliability 
indicators of parallel subsystems lines of wells are a1, a2, a3 and b1, b2, b3.

The system operates if all three parallel lines of wells and serial subsystems are 
in order but, also, when one of the three lines of wells is in failure. In case of serial 
subsystems failure the system is out of order, but at this point, since conditionally 
they are out of operation, lines of parallel wells subsystems cannot be in failure. 
Conditional failure for parallel subsystems lines of wells as a whole resulting from 
malfunctioning or upon failure of two lines.  
The functioning of such installed parallel dewatering subsystem, for each well 
system can be represented by a stationary process with two conditions. Elementary 
failure flow of each well plant has intensity (a). Recovery rate has an exponential 
distribution with parameter (b). Conditions of each parallel line are (S0) if it is in 
operation and (S1) if it is in failure, that is, if the system is in renewal (fig. 3).  
Stationary probabilities can be obtained easily by solving general linear 
algebraic equations for the limit subsystems condition probabilities: a*P0 = b*P1, 
P0+P1 = 1.  
So for the first line it is for example:  
P01 = 1/(1+a1/b1), P11 = (a1/b1)(1/(1+a1/b1))                       (5) 
Stationary probability of the parallel subsystem operation with two lines of 
wells, which is out of operation in the event of failure of one of the wells or lines 
is: 
PoII = P01*P02 = (1/(1+ a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))                         (6) 
Operation probability for the parallel sub-systems installed with three lines of 
wells is its whole: 
PoIII = P01*P02*P03 = (1/(1+ a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))           (7) 
Operation probability of the subsystem when in failure is the first line of wells 
is: 
Po1 = (a1/b1)(1/(1+a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))                  (8) 
Operation probability of the subsystem when in failure is the second line of 
wells is: 
Po2 = (a2/b2)(1/(1+ a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))                  (9) 
Operation probability of the subsystem when in failure is the third line of wells 
is: 
Po3 = (a3/b3)(1/(1+a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))                   (10) 
Stationary probability of the parallel system conditional failure when in failure 
is two lines of wells are provided by equations: 
P12 = (a1a2/b1b2)(1/(1+a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))   
P13 = (a1a3/b1b3)(1/(1+a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))   
P23 = (a2a3/b2b3)(1/(1+a1/b1))(1/(1+a2/b2))(1/(1+a3/b3))            (11) 
Stationary probability of system operation with three lines of wells of the same 
reliability characteristics is: 
PrIII = 1-(1-P01)3                                              (12) 

108

Stationary operation probability for combined system lines of wells is (fig. 3): 
Prk = (PrIII+Pr1+Pr2+Pr3)Pc*Pv*Pp*Pr                           (13) 
3.4 
Process Reliability Dewatering System Model  
Reliability of dewatering systems operation in real time is the basis for analyzing 
the Model effects of the system as a whole and its individual elements. Within the 
established process model for the reliability dewatering system analysis (fig. 4), is 
performed establishing of lines of wells combined system reliability and combined 
flow by calculations of the stationary probabilities for subsystems and systems 
operation, including analysis of environmental impacts and verification and 
optimization of economic analysis reliability.  
Presented model of the process analysis and reliability optimization is the part 
of the overall planning procedure and dewatering systems implementation and can 
be used as an element for development of an opencast mine integrated information 
dewatering system [3].

Selection of Groundwater Dewatering System  
for the Opencast Mine Drmno  
Opencast mine Drmno in Kostolac coal basin is an ideal example for the selection 
of an optimal groundwater dewatering system. It is about 100 km east from 

Design of the Opencast Coal Mine Drmno Dewatering System

Belgrade. The Main Mining Design envisages excavation of 43.5*106 m3 of 
overburden and 9 Mio tons of coal annually.  
Considering the very large inflow of groundwater in the alluvia of rivers 
Danube and Mlava, a detailed techno-economic analysis of capabilities to protect 
the opencast mine Drmno has been carried out, only by line of wells or by a 
combination of waterproof screen and line of wells with reduced number of wells. 
It has provided the bases of hydrodynamic calculation for reductions of 
groundwater levels and hydrodynamic model of coal deposit Drmno has been 
presented, and methodology includes hydrodynamic model of coal deposit Drmno 
recalibration, hydrodynamic calculation for groundwater levels reducing and the 
results of forecasting calculations, reliability analysis and techno-economic 
analysis.  
Dewatering system for the surface water is not included since it is the same in 
both cases, and consists of a perimeter, bench and dewatering channels, water 
collector and pump stations. 
4.1 
Hydrodynamic Model of Deposit Drmno 
Hydrodynamic calculations for requirements of sizing wells number, their common 
distances and individual capacities, as well as to forecast the effects for the defence 
system against groundwater have been implemented in a hydrodynamic model of 
the groundwater regime for the wider area of coal deposit Drmno.  
Hydrodynamic model of the opencast mine Drmno was conceived and designed 
as multi seam model, with a total of six seams, as seen in the vertical profile. Each 
of these seams corresponds to a particular real seam, schematically presented and 
separated based on knowledge of the field and the results of analysis conducted 
via extensive field exploration works. The floor of the fifth or sixth seam (to and 
fro), makes the 3rd coal seam, which by its hydrogeological and hydraulic 
mechanisms represents an insulator, i.e. the current limit surface. The movement 
of the groundwater on the model has been calculated and simulated as the real 
movement under the pressure, or with free level, in the each discretization field 
separately, wherein aquifer flow conditions over time were changed in the model 
in accordance with the real conditions [5]. 
4.2 
Estimated Calculation – Setting 
In accordance with the accepted development schedule for the opencast mine 
Drmno, has been defined contours of the advance mine direction in general, the 
specific time sections. In the option calculations have been analyzed two options 
of the mine defence system against groundwater: 
- 
Option 1 - opencast mine defence by dewatering wells, and  
- 
Option 2 - combined opencast mine defence system by waterproof screen 
and dewatering wells. 
In both cases, as the current situation is taken condition of mining operations at 
end of the year 2012, and the results of foreseen calculations are provided for the 
three time sections.

Option 1 - Mine Defence by Dewatering Wells  
In Option 1 dewatering wells were set along the line of wells in parallel to the 
mine advance direction. Drained by wells are gravel and sand in the roof of the 
main coal seam. 
Option 2 - Mine Defence by Combined System   
This option for mine protection against groundwater implies the existence of the 
waterproof screen and dewatering wells. In Option 2, the western, northern and 
eastern borders of the mine (till the mining end) are contoured by waterproof 
screen with the depth to the second coal seam, that is, waterproof clays. 
Construction of waterproof screen begins in the year 2013, and ends at the end of 
the year 2017 (fig. 5). 
As an example, is shown a condition of works, in both cases at the end of the year 
2027 as at figure 5, when are fully express the effects of the constructed screen.

Results of the Forecasting Calculations  
Calculation forecasted results for dewatering of the opencast mine Drmno, as per 
conducted hydrodynamic analysis are interpreted and presented as follows: 
- 
To display the calculation results it has been accepted three characteristic 
time sections, namely: the end of the 2020, the end of the 2027 and the 
end of the year 2038 (for each option); 
- 
Monitoring wells level in sandy sediments in the roof of the 3rd coal seam 
obtained by calculations are presented in the form of hidro contour lines 
map provided with the equidistance of 5 m, for each option and each time 
section;

- 
Balance of groundwater is provided by the balance of the lines of wells 
ahead of the advance mine direction, and through the balance of 
individual wells within these lines. 
Figures 6 and 7 provide examples of layout maps for monitoring wells level in 
the sandy water bearing seam of the 3rd roof coal seam, for the selected time-
section at the end of the year 2027.  
As a result of wells system intensive operation, within the contours of the 
dewatering system occurs significant reduction of monitoring wells groundwater 
levels in roof sands. In the example for the second time-section (end of the year 
2027) was achieved almost identical groundwater level overthrow in front of the 
opencast mine in both options, but in Option 2 within the area covered by the 
screen at the wider area reduced level of groundwater table is up to 10 m more 
than within the option 1. Table 1 shows the comparative values of the number of 
wells, the total capacity of new wells and their average values for both options and 
for all three time sections.

From table 1 it can be concluded as follow: 
- 
In option 1, 460 wells more than in the option 2 is made where, in addition 
to a small number of dewatering wells, there is a waterproof screen. 
- 
At the end of the year 2020 (the first analyzed of the dewatering system 
operation section) number of new constructed wells is identical with 
approximately the same total capacity of these wells.  
- 
In the second time section, in the Option 2, 50% less groundwater is 
captured with locally higher reduction of levels. 
- 
In the third time section, something bigger overthrow of the groundwater 
level has been achieved by defence system simulated in Option 2, with 
the participation of six times smaller number of dewatering wells than in 
Option 1 and by five times less capture of groundwater. 
- 
Inflow of groundwater in the opencast mine, besides fro dewatering wells 
declines over a time, slightly lower values (from 13-20%) were obtained in 
Option 2. 
At the end of the hydrodynamic analysis it can be concluded that the increased 
reduction of groundwater levels is achieved in Option 2 regarding mine protection, 
which includes dewatering wells and waterproof screen.

Reliability of Dewatering System for the Opencast Mine 
Drmno  
The functioning of the dewatering system is defined as a random process with 
system condition realization exponentially distributed time. Installed dewatering 
system can have three conditions (S0, S1, S2) according to the graph at figure 2.  
An example is done for operation conditions in the year 2027 when according to 
the Option 2 waterproof screen is fully in operational with 104 wells, while in 
Option 1 in the operation are 237 wells. With dewatering by wells is permitted 
limited partial failure in the condition of S1 to 75% from the normal condition S0, so 
that in the condition S1 in operation is 178, and in failure 59 wells for Option 1, and 
in operation are 78 and in failure 26 wells in Option 2. At transition from operation 
condition S0 in the failure condition S2 due to unforeseen extreme reasons, failure 
intensity is 0.00012, and the intensity of recovery 0.002 for both options. Average 
recovery time per well is 15 hours. From the condition S1 occur conditional system 
failure with the condition S2 during deterioration of operation of 75% compared to 
the condition S1, when in the Option 1 in operation are 134 wells, and in failure 
additional 44 wells, while in the Option 2 in operation are 59 wells, and in failure 
additional 19 wells. Reliability parameters for the provided conditions in the 
calendar time, according to the equation (4), are shown in table 2. 
Clearly, it is evident that combined system is for 22% more reliable compared 
to the dewatering system only by wells in the condition S0 and with 14% lower 
probability of staying in an unfavourable condition with difficult operation of the 
S1, while in the conditional condition failure S2, Option 2 is reliable four times if 
compared with Option 1.

the approximately same characteristics of reliability is (P01 = P02 = P03 = 0.9) (12): 
PrIII = 1-(1-P01)3 = 1-(1-0.90)3 = 0.999 
Based on the statistical data of previous work for the installed lines of wells in 
the opencast mine Drmno, the operation probability for the combined system is 
(13): 
Prk = P03*Pc*Pv*Pp*Pr = 0.999*0.98*0.97*0.98*0.98 = 0.91 
Minimum are required three parallel lines of wells in operation for the 
implementation of the scheduled system dewatering reliability at Drmno mine. 
4.5 
Techno-economic Analysis 
Option 1, provides the opencast mine Drmno protection against groundwater only 
by dewatering wells system, while Option 2, foreseen protection is by the 
combined method, that is, by system of dewatering wells and waterproof screen. 
Construction of wells, as well as waterproof screen construction is handed over to 
a third party.  
By the end of the year 2038 for dewatering of groundwater in Option is 
required to construct less than 460 wells or to drill less than 54,335 m of boreholes 
in relation to Option 1 (tab. 1). In addition, it is necessary to procure and construct 
less than 10,530 m of gravity drain pipelines. Applying of Option 2 by the end of 
the year 2038 is to be used less than 127,125,558 kWh of electricity.  
Since that by dewatering only with dewatering wells (Option 1) is disturbed the 
regime and level of groundwater, it is required to provide for village Kličevac drinking 
water and to invest €4 m for the construction of water and water supply factory. In 
addition it is to be disturbed humidity of the surrounding agricultural land, and due to 
it is required to provide water for the irrigation of 650 hectares of land.  
Total investment in the system for protection of the opencast mine Drmno 
against groundwater by Option 1 amounts to €146 m, and by Option 2 it is €137 
m. The implementation of Option 2 for the protection of the opencast mine Drmno 
against groundwater till the end of the year 2038 it is required to invest €9 m less 
than in Option 1. Based on the DCF analysis it was determined that in Option 1, 
investment in dewatering system amounts to 0.47 €/t of coal, while by investment 
implementation for Option 2 is 0.44 €/t of coal.  
To protect the opencast mine Drmno against groundwater in Option 1 in the 
next 26 years it is required to be invested annually on average about €5.6 m, while 
for the protection by Option 2 is required to invested annually on average about 
€5.3 m. An average cost for dewatering of the opencast mine Drmno against 
groundwater per tonne of coal for a period of 26 years are more favourable in 
Option 2 (0.59 €/t compared to  0.62 €/t in Option 1). The dynamic growth of the 
total annual cost is provided in the chart at figure 8.  

Design of the Opencast Coal Mine Drmno Dewatering System 
115
 
 
From the present chart it can be concluded that the total annual cost are to some 
extent higher in the initial phase of the protection system against groundwater 
implementation in Option 2, which is primarily due to investments in the 
construction of waterproof screen, but during later phases of implementation are 
significantly less than the total annual cost for Options 1. In addition the total 
annual cost of Option 1 shows a distinct cyclist in the occurrence of extreme high 
values as a result of constant investment in new lines of wells.  
Considering the relatively small difference in the total and average costs it can 
be concluded that the final decision on the acceptance of the system for protection 
against groundwater is conditioned by other system elements, too, such as 
dewatering system reliability and environmental effects associated with the impact 
on the groundwater level outside the contour of the opencast mine and safer 
system operation of the HPP Iron Gate. The implementation of Option 2 reduces 
disturbance of groundwater regimes, and thus harm to the environment. A small 
number of wells significantly reduced the amount of water that is discharged into 
the Mlava and Danube rivers, which results in safer operation of the HPP Djerdap.  
From the above is derived conclusion that the system of wells and the screen 
provided in Option 2, is economically, environmentally and in terms of reliability 
better if compared to Option 1.

Concluding Remarks 
In addition to a range of natural, technical, economic, environmental and safety 
factors and limitations, one of the most influential natural factors on the surface 
mining is the influence of surface and groundwater on the production processes 
and the stability of the site and the final slope system for the both, opencast mine 
and dump site. Due to the complexity and multidisciplinary nature, system 
selection and construction of opencast mine dewatering facilities cannot be 
implemented without geological and hydrodynamic modeling of the working 
environment, by the application of the modern approaches to determine the 

116 
V. Pavlovic, D. Polomčić, and T. Šubaranovič
 
 
reliability of the dewatering system and optimization of dewatering facilities. For 
effective and efficient dewatering of opencast mines is not sufficient optimal 
selection of systems and facilities, but also well organized and manageable 
process of dewatering.  
When planning dewatering until the end of mining period it is necessary to 
achieve, in addition to the requirements for safe and reliable mining, 
environmental and social conditions, that is to eliminate negative environmental 
impacts, effective use of land and water resources, and social and economic 
benefits in the course of sustainable development and operation of the opencast 
mine.  
The present model is a synthesis of the theoretical basis and practical aspects 
for the dewatering system implementation and by the established procedures it can 
significantly support experts which in practice are dealing with dewatering 
projects. Defined model is fully verified on the example of dewatering facilities 
selection and optimization of the groundwater dewatering system in the opencast 
mine Drmno.

New Technological Developments in the Field  
of Vibro-Compaction in the Lusatian Lignite 
Mining Area 
Charles-Andre Uhlig 
GMB GmbH, Senftenberg, Germany 
1 Introduction / Background 
In order to create a safe and sustainable postmining landscape in the Lusatian 
lignite mining area dynamic compaction methods at great depths of about 65 m 
are required. This involves extremely high technical demands on the applied 
vibro-compaction (VC) methods. These include the vibro-flotation (VF) and a 
vibro-displacement method (VD).  
The choice of vibrocompaction method applied in the Lusatian lignite mining 
depends on the local geologic conditions, such as particle size distribution and 
local ground water level. (Figure 1)  
 
Fig. 1 Application of VF or VD depending on the particle size distribution 
Advantages of the use of vibrators for ground improvement compared to the 
use of large-scale and cost-effective explosive compaction can be found in 
particular in the degree of compaction that can be reached subsurface. Thus, the 

118

compaction effect is nearly complete and the available pore space can be reduced 
to a maximum when using the VF. Other benefits of the VF are significant 
improvements to the soil parameters, such as increased shear strength and 
decreased consolidation parameters. The primary target for using the VF-
procedure is to increase the density of the soil on site. Only this method of soil 
improvement can ensure that the geotechnical safety of the postmining landscape 
sustainably. The state of the art technology already in use, allows vibro-
compaction operations at depths of up to about 70 m. With the development of 
construction projects on dumps and for the safe landscaping of the postmining 
areas vibro-compaction methods are of great importance and value. In particular, 
the dumps in the Lusatian mining area, with their loosely deposited, non-cohesive, 
narrow-classified sands tend with water saturation due to the gradual rising of the 
groundwater level to liquefaction and flow-slide. It is therefore sometimes 
necessary to vibro - compact open pit dumps, also those with a higher thickness of 
the F60-mining dumps, down to the footwall. 
Due to the strict requirements mentioned, the mining operator Vattenfall 
Europe Mining AG (VE-M) decided to establish a new business area for vibro-
compaction. During the financial year 2010, the GMB GmbH (GMB), a subsidiary 
of Vattenfall Europe Mining AG, began after extensive preparatory work with 
vibro compaction operations. The company has been operating successfully for 
about three years, currently with 2 vibro-compaction units. The establishment of a 
safe postmining landscape with a high geotechnical quality is one of the 
fundamental tasks of every mining operator. Hence the needs to build up a group's 
own business field can be summarized as follows:  
• 
The guidelines specified in the general lignite plans determine the uses of 
the postmining landscape; these requires extensive activities in the coming 
years and place high demands on the capacity and stability of the 
subsurface  
• 
There are vast areas to be compacted and thus a considerable volumes of 
soil 
• 
The aim is to minimize negative impacts on the environment and 
neighbourhood; the effects or impacts by using the ideal compaction 
method 
• 
Intragroup development and expansion of technical know-how for 
improved process understanding, process control and cost control; the 
long-term and reliable availability of technical know-how is essential for 
the fulfilment of the mining law obligations  
• 
The thickness of the foundation soil / dumps to be improved is very high 
(> 45 m)  
• 
Only when using a reliable method and by providing the necessary 
documentations accessibility also for  vehicles of the postmining 
landscape depending on the type of use can be guaranteed in the long term 
by the mining operator

Construction Equipment and Complex State of the Art 
Technology 
In preparation for the commencement of regular operation of the VF intensive 
preparation work was done by the departments mining services and engineering of 
GMB. As a result of these preparations relevant technological and geotechnical 
specifications anticipated, have a significant impact on the device parameters 
analysed. The determined project process parameters such as working depth and 
the necessary foreland between carrier and working point were the basis for the 
technical dimensioning of the VF complex. The experience gained in remediation 
work since the early 1990's about the use of technology and infrastructure of the 
VF were of course taken into consideration during the preparation of the project. 
With the practical experience already gained and as a result of the process analysis 
carried out by GMB the planned technology use was modified. In addition not 
purely technical aspects, but also extensive changes in the labour safety and 
process reliability were introduced by GMB.  
Specifically, the first project required (1st section of tank transport road 
Nochten) compaction of depths up to 45 m with a required foreland > 20 m. These 
specifications were the basis for the sizing and selection of the lance set and the 
carrier. The real working tool the vibrator is a steel body and has the form of a 
torpedo. The dimensions and thus the performance of the working tool depend 
very much on the intended use. Common dimensions are between 3 m to 5 m in 
length, a diameter of 30cm to 40 cm with an impact force of up to 500 kN and a 
power consumption of 50 to 200 kW. The diameter of the circular arc described 
by the movement of the vibrator is device-specific between approximately 6 mm 
and 4 cm. The resting point of the working tool is below the clutch. By means of 
the use of a vibration-damping elastic coupling between vibrator and the lance the 
loss of vibration of the vibrator is minimized. In the working process the vibrator 
impacts directly on the surrounding soil. After extensive technical discussions 
with potential providers a vibrator of the performance class V 48 with an impact 
force of 450 kN, and a tip and side water supply and a corresponding lance probe 
of the company VIBRO Services were rented.  
In addition to the work unit vibrator there is another primary component the 
carrier crawlercrane. Only on the basis of correct economical and technical 
consideration the correct dimensioning of the carrier crane for an efficient and safe 
VC-process is possible. The requirements of each single project vary depending 
on cost, safety and performance objectives. Primarily the carrier unit should 
always have the necessary lifting force and lifting height for each specific 
application.  
The process of VF requires a reliable supply of water and compressed air. The 
media air and water are fed to the process through the so-called media-mixing-
equipment in variable proportions.  
Given the importance of the provision of air and water, the first activities for 
technical process improvement focused among others on the insulation of the 
media-mixing-device. By means of these technical improvements, stable winter 
operation down to very low temperatures (max. -25°C) is guaranteed. 

120

Furthermore, the improvement of penetration process was optimized by a new 
arrangement of nozzles for the top and side water supply of the vibrator. The 
installation of a frequency converter, which controls the start-up process of the 
vibrator as well as the speed and direction of rotation, was a further important 
technical improvement.  
The compressed air is supplied by an electrical compressor. The compressor 
installation is housed in a fully enclosed and thus noise-reduced container. The 
negative environmental forces acting directly on the technical components were 
also significantly reduced with this technical measure. Using an electrical 
compressor, there was significant improvement in the energy efficiency. The 
components compressed air supply, frequency converter and control cabinets were 
installed in a backpack design directly on the carrier unit. With the permanent 
installation of the components on the carrier the advance and efficiency of the VF-
equipment complex increases. The winter safe water supply is accommodated in a 
compact designed container module that is carried at the working level behind the 
carrier. In the heated water supply module a water storage tanks and an electrically 
operated booster pump were installed.  
A heavier lance with a diameter of 400 mm was used and it was assumed to 
have resulted in a reduced penetration period. A positive effect has not been 
established yet.  
Until now GMB has successfully carried out compaction operations with the 
described methods for vibro-compaction construction sites at depths of up to at 
least +45 m up to +65 m in the standard process. The near-surface areas (depth < 
10 m) are processed project specific with other compaction methods, such as the 
falling weight compaction or the use of a vibratory roller.  
3 Experiences  
3.1 
Dimensioning Carrier Unit 
With the experience gathered in the production process when using the Dragline 
Liebherr HS 895 HD it was concluded, that this carrier is not optimal for the 
intended purpose of utilization.  The equipment was operated in VF-project at a 
depth of up to 45 m. Besides technical disadvantages especially the geotechnical 
conditions on site required a frequent operation at the absolute limit of the 
performance of the equipment. Furthermore the high installed motor power made 
the machine inefficient. The limitation in available lifting forces led to the 
decision to use the carrier crane type Liebherr LR 1300 for the production process 
(Figure 2).  
For the case with compaction depths greater than 45 m it’s from safety and 
process engineering point of view worth considering only cranes of the order of a 
LR 1600 and LR 1750. During the decision making process also the dimensioning 
and the planned applications for the selected unit by the equipment manufacturer 
had to be taken into account. The anticipated operating environment and thus the 
dimensioning of the LR 1600 carrier are found in the technical design of the 

New Technological Developments in the Field of Vibro-Compaction  
121
 
 
manufacturer Liebherr. The carrier is normally used on construction sites and not 
in opencast mines. The manufacturer therefore proposed the acquisition of a 
LR1750 for the planned vibro-compaction operations. According to the 
manufacturer the underlying statics of a LR 1600 crane is not designed for long-
term use in surface mining operations with difficult subterranean conditions. In 
particular, the undercarriage of the LR 1600 does not meet the long-term needs 
and requirements in mining operations. 
Other factors to be considered are derived from the technological requirements. 
The lance including accessories may have at some constructions site, a length of 
70 m and more. This means a total weight of about 40 tons. This requires, to 
ensure a satisfactory productivity, a significantly higher lifting capacity of the 
carrier. In ordinary forelands a crane similar to a LR1750 is required. Already 
today, at depths of 65m + +; lifting forces of up to 80 tonnes in the standard 
process are required in order to ensure a continuous production process. As a 
result of experiences gathered by GMB in 2013 a Liebherr LR 1750 was 
purchased. For example, a two- to three-times reserve in lifting capacity is 
beneficial and meaningful in difficult ground conditions. The lifting forces of up 
to 120 tonnes in the standard process should be applied.

Labour and Process Safety  
The state of the art in the business field vibro-compaction of GMB is considered 
as reached. A variety of technical improvements were implemented in different 
process segments: So the technical equipment for example, was adapted such that 
reliability down to minus 20°C is guaranteed. In practice the new technical 
solutions have proven their suitability down to minus 26°C. Therefore year-round 
unit use (winter) provides an optimised equipment utilization. Furthermore there is 
now a hydraulic press being designed, which will allow in future a safe recovery

of lance and vibrator when necessary. In addition the revised process data 
collection ensures a better process control through extensive and more precisely 
processed data. The highly important objective of establishing a long-term holistic 
and safe data processing (see 4.2) as an important part of the dump registry is 
realized in the process on site. A variety of organisational measures and 
definitions ensures a smooth and efficient process realization.  
From an extensive risk assessment of the compaction process, in which the 
geotechnical, technical and behavioural hazards have been assessed in detail, an 
overall operational health and safety process documentation was compiled. 
Besides the best practice design of the production process, it is vital to maintain 
employee safety on site at all times. In this context, together with the fire brigade 
of VEM a new rescue technology has been developed. (Figure 3) This includes 
behavioural rules and new technical solutions which allow a quick and simple 
assistance in case of an emergency. Of course prevention is of highest priority.

4 Application of New Software Solutions 
4.1 
Planning, Implementation, Evaluation  
Of particular importance for the improvement and optimization of the vibro-
compaction process are the process data acquisition and control, as well as the 
process data analysis. The application of a software solution for the planning and 
evaluation of ground compaction measures of GMB is based on the software SCMS 
from the company Gicon. The software Soil Compaction Management System 
(SCMS) from Gicon existed as software solution for the control and preservation of 
process data as version 1.X. The program has been used to date for the analysis of 
extensive data in practice, and has proven its functionality. Despite this tests were

123
 
 
carried out by GMB with the SCMS software version 1 to check suitability. Before 
that a pre-selection based on a market research and a cost evaluation for other 
solutions or an own software development was done. Among others software, 
especially the solution of remediation businesses used were considered and rated. 
The result of the assessment was the necessity of expanding the functionality for all 
the different software solutions investigated. As a result of the specifications listed 
by GMB the Gicon company’s interest was stimulated to launch a new improved 
version of SCMS. The functionality of the software solution has been enhanced with 
a variety of new features. In addition to the existing exclusive use as evaluation tool 
for realized vibro-compaction points important innovations have been integrated 
into SCMS version 2. Examples thereof are:  
• 
Inclusion of additional soil compaction methods (vibro-compaction 
with step-back technology, falling weight compaction)  
• 
Im-/export planning data (import of MicroStation file into SCMS, export 
of SCMS for process data control (PDC) of vibro-compaction unit) 
• 
Basic expansion of import functionality of SCMS (supplied data from 
PDC are accurately assigned to planning data)  
• 
Significant enhancements in geotechnical monitoring (monitoring via 
preliminary assessment, construction site management and follow-up 
assessment including data comparisons between the different 
exploration phases)  
• 
Functional extension for the following field exploration: drilling, 
geophysics, combined penetration tests, sampling, soil boring, trenches) 
• 
Inclusion of cross-links to other information systems (LIMS) of GMB  
• 
Free export options to Excel for detailed evaluations in detail 
• 
AddIn MicroStation  
• 
further extension of GIS functionality  
o display of packing-compaction-points  
o setting up an interface to GIS solution of VE-M  
• 
Introducing the function of construction and planning of disintegrated 
compaction-grids  
In Figure 4 the basic sequence of VC-project is presented. In phases 1 and 3 
Office software solutions are used. These include the programs MicroStation, 
ArcGIS, SCMS.  
The planning specifications for the compaction process are now created 
through the software solutions SCMS / MicroStation. The planning data is handed 
over to the production process through a pre-defined interface. Planning data is 
therefore directly available without further efforts for the production process. In 
the production process a separate software solution is used. Smooth operations are 
ensured by a clear rule on the interfaces between Phase 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Upon 
completion of Phase 2 the process data is transferred, stored and displayed 
according to the defined parameters in the systems mentioned above. The 
preparation of the immediate success control as basis for the final documentation 
is efficient and reliable generated.

Process Control and Process Data Acquisition  
The complete control of the compaction process, which includes the vibrator, the 
compressor, the media-mixing-device (control unit for water/air), the water pump 
and the frequency converter, is possible from the cockpit via touch panel in the 
cab of the carrier. The data recording of compaction process is done by a 
programmable logic control. All data required for the evaluation will be saved on

a suitable storage medium over a period of 8 weeks. The reading of the data is 
done using USB-ports and Ethernet-interfaces at present. In perspective the data 
transfer is provided by radio transmission (Figure 5). In case of unplanned 
occurrences an evaluation afterwards is always possible using video cameras 
installed which are directed on the work point. 
5 Optimization Potentials and Objectives  
Basically a further reduction of the average penetration period has to be achieved. 
Sensors which monitor precise information about the location and position of 
vibrator and lance will be installed. Based on this information the overall 
availability of the equipment complex will be increased (e.g. reduced sticking of 
the lance underground, minimize number of total loss of equipment). In the 
penetration process operators of the complex can maintain a safe vertical 
penetration of the lance, thereby optimizing the entire penetration process. 
Aberration during the penetration process may be detected early. In future 
additional information and data will be stored in a complex database (GPS, power 
consumption, temperature, amount of water, etc.). This data will be compared with 
the knowledge about the dump geology (preliminary and follow-up field 
exploration) and is combined with the goals of process and cost optimization. The 
future aim is to develop a reliable online success control. This tool enables the 
persons responsible to carry out the process more accurately and efficiently during 
the process execution. An equally important element is a continuous quality 
control and documentation of the entire production process.  
In the short term there is a continuous increase in the overall availability of the 
entire equipment complex at the center of all operations. This is predominantly an 
organisational advantage. The benchmark is an overall availability of 90 %. 
The substantial expenses involved with stuck lance underground have to be 
reduced by using alternative recovery technologies. Up to now one solution to 
accelerate the recovery process was tested in practice. The support of the lifting 
forces of the carrier with a hydraulic recovery device is right in test mode at 
present. The main challenge is ensuring an optimum grip between the lance probe 
and hydraulic driven recovery device. Forces to be handled are up to 400 tonnes. 
Currently an supportive additional method is being prepared and planned to be 
tested soon. The accelerated recovery of the vibrator and lance was attempted by 
means of vibrations.  
6 Summary  
In order to create a safe and sustainable postmining landscape in the Lusatian 
lignite mining area dynamic compaction methods at great depths of about 65 m 
are required. This includes extremely high technical demands on the applied 
vibro-compaction methods. Due to the existing requirements GMB began in 2010 
with vibro-compaction operations. GMB has been able to demonstrate a very 

126 
C.-A. Uhlig
 
 
positive development for the first 3 years since the commissioning of the first 
complex of vibro compaction. Newly introduced technical solutions and the use of 
improved or new software solutions led to a sustainable process improvement. In 
practice the suitability of all new introduced features could be verified to external 
temperatures of minus 26 degrees centigrade. Occupational safety has been 
improved by a new fuse technology. Especially significant for the further 
improvement and optimization of the vibro compaction processes are the recently 
launched process data acquisition and process control, as well as the subsequent 
process data analysis. Tasks and objectives for further process development are 
described and milestones for their implementation in the coming months and years 
are defined. Apart from the exact determination of the position of vibrator and 
lance during the production process the ‘online-process control’, which is pooling 
a variety of process parameters, is of the utmost importance.

Abstract. Current development of open-cast mining is characterized by 
complication of geological conditions and increased requirements to reduce the 
negative environmental impact. A significant role in solving problems concerning 
management of mineral resources allocated to internal dumping and justification 
of such dump geometric dimensions which provide simultaneously stability and 
minimum spacing. 
Stability of internal overburden dumps while surface mining depends on physical 
and mechanical properties of the rock mass, climatic factors, groundwater levels, 
shape and geometry of the foundation, and external loads. Complex influence of 
these factors leads to the emergence and outspreading geomechanical deformations in 
the dump core with the formation of rockslides, which complicate the mining 
operations and result in an increase of the specific mining capital expenditures. 
Therefore, effective management of open-cast mining technology, internal 
overburden dumping on inclined foundations is an important engineering issue. 
Reliable estimation of high internal dumps stability in the conditions of gently 
sloping and inclined foundations by modern numerical geomechanical models 
allows optimize surface mining operations as a whole and decrease harmful 
impact on environment.  
The paper deals with the estimating stability of internal dumps at open pit 
“Maikubenskiy” in Kazakhstan using GGU-Stability software. The safety factors 
for open-cast slopes depending on geomechanical properties of overburden mass, 
inclination of foundation and mining equipment loads by Bishop failure criterion 
are calculated. The most stable geometric parameters for internal dumps on the 
inclined foundation are determined.  
This research was carried out at the Department of Hydrogeology and 
Engineering Geology of the RWTH Aachen University (Germany). 
Keywords: stability of internal dumps, safety factor, inclined foundation,

Introduction 
Open-cast “Maikubenskiy” is a coal mine company specializing in mining brown 
coal of Shoptykolskoye coalfield with an annual project capacity of 25 million 
tons of coal per year. At present, the actual output is about 4 million tons per year 
and it is planned to increase an annual coal output up to 8 million tons. Brown 
coal seams are mined by the advanced open-cast technology with internal 
dumping.  
Shoptykolskoye coalfield is characterized by flat and slightly inclined coal 
seams in the range of 4…10°. The overburden is deposited both inside and outside 
of the open-cast area by using traffic (Eastern tract) and non-traffic mining 
systems (Central tract). Considerable volumes of overburden reduce the 
technological and economic performance of the enterprise and negatively 
influence to the territory adjacent to the national park “Jasybay”.  
Flat bedding of brown coal seams (4°-12°) allows optimize mining operations 
by using internal space of the open-cast for disposal of overburden mass. Internal 
dumping reduces outlay on transportation of overburden into external dumps and 
minimize negative environmental load on the territory.  
The oblective of this paper is estimating stability of internal overburden dumps 
on the flat and inclined foundations in application to geological and mining 
conditions of open-cast “Maikubenskiy” (Kazakhstan) by geomechanical 
calculations in the GGU-Stability software.

Methodology and Theoretical Background for Analysis  
in GGU-Stability Program  
The GGU-Stability program system allows slope failure investigations according 
to German Standard DIN 4084, DIN 4084:1996 and DIN 4084:2009, using 
circular slip surfaces (Bishop) and polygonal slip surfaces (Janbu, General Wedge 
method and Vertical slice method) [1]. Furthermore it is possible to investigate 
soil nailing and reinforced earth walls.  
Analysis uses the design variables φd  and cd:  
tan φd = tan φk / γφ,  
 
 
 
(1) 
cd = ck / γc,  
 
 
 
 
(2) 
where φk and ck  are characteristic shear strength values; φd and cd are the shear 
strength design values. 
Stability is then analysed using the modified values. This gives the safety factor 
η in accordance with the global safety factor concept, but relative to the design 
values. The reciprocal of this “global safety factor ηd” gives the utilisation factor μ 
in accordance with the partial safety factor concept:  
μ = 1/ηd.

Fig. 1 Circular slip surfaces by the Bishop failure criterion 
In the GGU-Stability program, ∆ui is calculated by multiplying the pore water 
pressure coefficient and the effective vertical stresses. Alternatively, you have the 
possibility of defining so-called consolidation layers. Using the required input 
data, the program carries out a one-dimensional consolidation calculation.  
The above mentioned relationships are described in detail in DIN 4084 and 
DIN 4084:2009. Partial factors are used in DIN 4084:2009. The safety factors are 
thus already incorporated in the soil properties, loads, etc. The term “safety 
factor” is thus already allocated. Instead of “η”, then, “μ” must be adopted in the 
above relationships, known as the “utilisation factor”.  
In accordance with DIN 4084 (old), the program uses the safety definition after 
Fellenius:  
η  = tan φwork./tan φreq.,  
 
 
 
(8) 
where φwork. and φreq. are friction angles under working load and required [2].

Estimating Stability of Internal Overburden Dumps and 
Input Data 
For the purpose of estimating stability of overburden dumps on the inclined surface, 
the standard Bishop (circles/slices) calculation method integrated in the GGU-
Stability program is chosen. This method is based on determination of multiple 
circles as possible slip surfaces in the slope that will be described below. The further 
 

Estimating Stability of Internal Overburden Dumps  
131
 
step is associated with building model geometry, selecting external surfaces and soil 
layers, assigning soil properties and entering water levels and loads. After assigning 
the centre-points of slip circles the system can be analysed. The minimum safety 
factors corresponding to each centre-point will be displayed. The slip circle with the 
lowest safety will also be graphically displayed. If the most unfavourable slip circle 
centre-point is at the edge of all defined centre-points, its position can be determined 
more precisely by assigning new centre-point array.  
There are some important notes concerning calculation procedure. The first one 
refers to the water levels because the program calculates the water load in the area 
of a slice and the horizontal loading of the slope due to water pressure. If the water 
level is below surface level it has no meaning for calculations. The second note 
concerns the number of slices because small numbers of slices mean low precision 
and shorter calculation times. Large slice numbers mean a correspondingly longer 
calculation time and higher precision. The minimum number of slices is also 
dependent upon the complexity of the slope. A slope which is heavily layered will 
require a larger number of slices than one which is homogenous. For general 
approach using at least 50 slices is recommended.  
According to the technology of internal dumping at the open-cast 
“Maikubenskiy” the overburden is expected to dispose in two layers. The lower 
layer with the height of 40 m is disposed by the walking dragline ESh–15/100 
with average load on the foundation Рdrag = 100 kPa, and the upper layer with the 
height up to 40 m by bulldozer D-394 with average load on the foundation Рb = 
43 kPa. The slope angle for disposed overburden rocks is 35°. The safety bench 
between lower and upper layers is recommended as 75 m. As the inclination of the 
internal foundation varies in the range of 0…14°, estimation of dump stability and 
determination of their reasonable geometrical parameters is essential for open-pit 
operations. For these reasons the GGU-Stability program was applied.

According to the national standards for slope stability of open-cast benches the 
safety factor depends on the soil properties and their changes in time, mining 
technology, static and dynamic loads etc. Taking into consideration just the most 
essential parameters impacting slope stability and limit equilibrium in the soil or 
rock mass the recommended value of the safety factor for overburden dumps slope 
stability during surface mining is 1.20 [3].  
Dump parameters depend mostly on bearing capacity of dump foundations, 
geomechanical properties of the overburden and mining equipment. For the 
conditions of the open-cast “Maikubenskiy” the calculated characteristics of the 
dump foundation and overburden mass are presented in the Table 1. 
The main objective of geomechanical modelling is an estimation of the limit 
geometrical parameters for internal dumps, evaluation of their stability due to 
physical and mechanical characteristics of the overburden and rock mass, and 
loads from mining equipment. 
According to the problem described above the overburden from mining 
operations is piled within the internal space of the quarry on the surface with 
inclination angles up to 15°. The external boundaries of the geomechanical model 
are: 500 m in width, 100 m below the ground surface as foundation layer consisted 
of clays and overburden mass with the height of 10...40 m above the ground 
surface (Figure 1). The angles of the overburden piles disposed on inclined 
foundation vary in the range 20…50 °. The groundwater level is at the 50 m below 
the surface but not considered at this research. The geomechanical model has two 
different layers and their properties are presented above in the Table 1. A 
permanent equipment load of 43 kN/m² on the slope is also considered.  
The dump stability was estimated by stage-by-stage building-up of its height Н 
with the step of 10 m. The position of the bulldozer D-394 towards the crest of the 
bench was also varied in the range of 2…10 m.

Results 
The Figure 1 presents general approach to evaluating internal dump stability based 
on Bishop (circles-slices) method. The calculation procedure allows to determine 
the most appropriate slip circle for the object according to Bishop failure criterion. 
In this case the flat surface of the dump foundation was considered with the total 
height of the overburden layer 40 m and the slope angle 35°. The safety factor is 
1.47 for the utmost justified height as for the first overburden layer.  
The Figure 2 presents main graphical results of the calculations of the 
overburden dump stability on the inclined foundation with the angles of 0…15°.

Fig. 2 FOS values for limit geometrical parameters of the overburden layer with the height

The approximate limit geometrical parameters of the overburden layer are the 
following: height H = 40 m and the slope angle α = 40°. Depending on the 
inclination of the foundation the safety factor is decreasing steadily from 1.16 to 
0.94. These conditions under assigned geometry and soil (rock) properties could 
be estimated as extreme stable for the dump. But this approach is not well 
appropriate for design because any external changes related to climatic variations, 
equipment loads etc. can reduce dump stability. So, the most desirable safety 
factor which should be oriented is above mentioned    ≥ 1.2 to ensure long-term 
stability of the dump. 
All results of simulation for overburden dump stability on inclined surface are 
presented in the Figure 3. A set of curves describes calculated values of FOS for 
specific geometry of the first layer of overburden on the foundation. A dotted line 
with the FOS = 1.0 just shows the state of failure.

Fig. 3 Results of simulation for overburden dump stability on inclined surface 
The obtained results of numerical simulation of the internal dump stability show 
that the height Н ≤ 40 м as project proposed value for the first layer of overburden 
should be accepted with a big caution. For flat or inclined surface with the ß ≤ 10° 
the slope angle values should not exceed α = 30…35° and the H is better to decrease 
to sufficiently safe value 30 m. If the foundation inclination angle increases up to 
ß ≥ 10° the slope angle values should not exceed α = 30° and the H ≤ 30 m as well. 
Establishment of the dumps with critical geometric parameters will result in large-
scale rockslides on the designated areas within the open-cast and destabilize 
operations on overburden transportation and disposal [4].  
According to the technological project of the open-cast “Maikubenskiy” the 
second layer of the overburden is recommended as an advisable environmental 
measure. This paper do not deal with estimation of double-benched dumps 
stability but some essential recommendations based on the obtained simulation 
results could be taken into consideration. The first one refers to the surface 
characteristics of the foundation and its interaction with the overburden layer that 
should be analyzed thoroughly regarding certain disposal site. The second 
recommendation concerns variable values of overburden properties depending on

Estimating Stability of Internal Overburden Dumps

Conclusions 
The paper presents a simulation results for stability of internal overburden dumps 
at the open-cast “Maikubenskiy” for which strength is modelled with the Bishop 
failure criterion in the GGU-Stability program.  
For geological and technological conditions of the open-cast “Maikubenskiy” 
the application of above mentioned technology of internal dumping is rational 
engineering decision. But the most problematic issue while surface mining 
operations is inclined bedding of brown coal deposits. As a result, all the mined 
out area inside the open-cast has tilting surface. Disposal of the overburden on 
such foundation can cause to instable condition of the internal dumps. Therefore 
justification of rational geometry for internal dumps and estimation their stable 
conditions under assigned physical and mechanical properties is an important 
stage in engineering design. 
The FOS values for different geometric profiles of foundation (ß = 0…10°) 
and overburden mass (H = 10…40 m, α = 20…50°) were estimated. It is 
established that for flat or inclined foundations with the ß ≤ 10° the slope angle 
values should not exceed α = 30…35° and the value of the most stable height for 
the first overburden layer H = 30 m. If the foundation inclination angle increases 
up to ß ≥ 10° the slope angle values should not exceed α = 30° and the H ≤ 30 m. 
The results obtained by numerical simulation serve as a basic justification for 
application of internal dumping that facilitate technological management of 
disposal operations at the open-cast and prognosis of potential rockslides.

Abstract. This paper presents the studies and the findings of various cases 
encountered during the development of slope failures detection methods at the 
Lignite mines of Ptolemais and Megalopolis, Greece. The type of failure is a 
compound one consisting of a nearly horizontal surface and a curved one at the 
back. The most important factor for the stability is the shear strength available in 
the planar part of the failure surface, which shows that a progressive failure is 
taking place. The investigations revealed that the development of a failure surface 
was from the toe to the crest and therefore impending slope failures can be 
detected and analysed long before any crack formation at the slope crest becomes 
visible. In addition, there are simple tools for failure monitoring that can be easily 
incorporated in the mining activities. The displacement velocity of a failure 
follows an exponential low with different parameters depending on failure 
condition.

Introduction 
Lignite is an essential component of the Greek energy policy, as the lignite’s share 
in power generation was 45% in the year 2013 with installed power plant capacity 
of 4.8 GW. The total lignite production for the same year was 52.5 Mt 
corresponding to 315 Mm3  of excavations (down from the past peak figures of 72 
Mt and 370 Mm³).  
The lignite is mined and transported by bucket-wheel excavators (BWE), 
spreaders, tripper cars and conveyor belts. To achieve this production, new deeper 
pits started operation in the last decades. The maximum pit depth increased from 
70m in 1980 to 170m in 2000, 240m in 2010 and it is expected to reach 300m by 
2030. 
This depth increase, combined with the non-flexible mining methods applied, 
created pressure to the geomechanical engineers involved in these mining 
activities. They had to develop methods for an early detection of slope failures, as 
mine pit design modifications were not easy to implement in a short period of 

138

time. Besides, the stabilization measures had to fit to mining machines capabilities 
and available personnel skills with the minimum production disturbance and 
production cost increase. 
 This paper presents the studies and the findings of various cases encountered 
during the development of slope failures detection methods at the Lignite mines of 
Ptolemais and Megalopolis. 
 The sediments of the Ptolemais basin, where the main lignite deposits are 
located, belong to Neogene (Pliocene) and are covered by those of Quaternary 
(Pleistocene and Recent). A typical stratigraphic column is given in Fig. 1 
(Anastopoulos et al. 1972).

Type of Slope Failures 
In the past, the most common among the failure types anticipated for the lignite 
pits rim slopes in Greece have been the rotational slips, either circular or non-
circular. Numerous stability assessments for lignite mine slopes were based on 
rotational slips. Some of these slopes, with a high calculated safety factor, failed 
even in cases with excellent sampling, laboratory work and stability calculations. 
This tradition of using circular failure surface for lignite mines is still active 
(Singh at al., 2011). 
These incidents have been examined and the following characteristics have 
been found common in all failures: 

Rim Slopes Failure Mechanism and Kinematics in the Greek Deep Lignite Mines 
139
 
$ The failures occurred at the time of the lowest lignite recovery 
$ The lower and central part of the slope moved as a block towards the 
excavation void, parallel to the lignite foot wall. This block had the shape of a 
truncated cone and it was slightly disturbed by few cracks. 
$ The surface, left at the slope after the slip, was a curved one with a high 
inclination in the crest area. 
$ A deep trench with crushed material was formed between the front block and 
the curved surface of the intact slope. 
The failure mechanism can be further understood by examining the photo in 
Fig. 2, which covers part of the slope shown in Fig. 3. In this case, the slope 
moved due to the failure about 8m before the successful application of 
stabilisation measures. Afterwards, a bucket wheel excavator removed material up 
to a depth of 30m from the surface (total slope height 80m), creating a nice cut 
that depicted a well developed but not collapsed failure. The photo shows the 
curved slip surface (B) formed in this area. Region A is the intact material with 
the strata dipping to the pit while in region C the inclination had reversed due to 
the rotation of the upper part of the failure. Further to the right, the photo shows 
the gradual recovery of strata inclination, from the reversed condition  (C) and (D) 
to normal (E). As the strata inclination did not change from region E up to the 
slope toe, it is reasonable to assume that this part of the slope moved as a block on 
a certain layer. 
As can be seen, the type of this failure is not circular, as suggested by the 
computational models, but a compound one consisting of a nearly horizontal 
surface and a curved one (see Fig. 3).

Strata inclination had reversed due to the rotation of the upper part of the failure. Further to 
te right, the gradual recovery of strata inclination, from the reversed condition (C) and (D) 
to normal (E) 
The answer to the question of the failure type is not only of scientific 
significance but it has practical implications concerning the suitability and the 
effectiveness of the stabilizing measures to be taken and also the proper 
interpretation of the slope monitoring data. Therefore, it was decided to proceed 
with 
further 
investigations 
using 
geomechanical 
instruments, 
mainly

inclinometers. The inclinometer measurements proved the compound type of the 
failures. 
From our studies and investigations, it was found that compound failures can 
develop in slopes with low inclination. In a such a case a 140m high slope with 
inclination 1:5 (V:H), started to slip on a clay layer just below the lowest lignite 
seam. The reason for such a behaviour is that a compound failure is not affected 
so much by the slope inclination as in a circular one. The most important factor 
for the stability in a compound slip is the shear strength available in the planar 
subhorizontal part of the failure surface.  
The safety factor for the compound slip can be lower than for the circular slip. 
In other words, in the case of a multilayer slope with one layer of lower shear 
strength compared to the other layers, the most probable failure type is the 
compound one with the planar part of the slip passing through the low strength 
layer. This theoretical conclusion is in agreement with the observations described 
above for the rim slopes failure in the Greek deep lignite mines, where more than 
one hundred layers can be identified.

Shear Strength and Stability Calculations 
Back analysis of failures in the lignite mines revealed very low shear strength  
(6 - 11 deg) in clayey layers, where the planar part of the compound slip was 
passing through. These low values were associated with very large displacements 
and, therefore, they were considered to represent residual strength. As expected, 
these values where notably lower from those obtained in conventional triaxial 
testing. Direct shear tests, conventional and in precut samples, produced better but 
not totally acceptable results. As this test suffers from several disadvantages, the 
ring shear apparatus was implemented afterwards. The results that have been 
produced from slow shearing, using this testing technique (Bromhead ring shear 
apparatus), were in good accord with the figures from back analysis. As the results 
from this test had been used in stability calculations with notable success in slope 
behaviour prediction, the ring shear became the main apparatus for shear testing. 
Although shear box testing is still in use for lignite slope stability estimation (Ural 
et al., 2004, Kayabasi et al., 2012), in Greece it is not used anymore. 

Rim Slopes Failure Mechanism and Kinematics in the Greek Deep Lignite Mines 
141
 
The use of residual strength in stability analysis implies that a progressive 
failure is taking place. As the materials in the lignite mines are over consolidated, 
the progressive failure is attributed to the initial stress conditions (differential soil 
strata relaxation during the stepped, bench by bench, excavation process). The 
same can happen during a dump construction, when a soft clay is present a the 
dump base (see Fig. 4). 
The condition of progressive failure does not satisfy the requirements of the 
limit equilibrium concept that is extensively used in the conventional stability 
analysis of slopes because a continuous slip surface, along which the soil behaves 
as a rigid body, does not exist. Numerical and other methods have been used for 
progressive failure analysis (Tutluoglu et al., 2011). Although such complex 
techniques are based on more rigorous analysis, according to the author’s 
experience, the simple methods based on the limit equilibrium analysis can be 
used with confidence for safety factor calculation. The simplicity combined with 
the averred prediction accuracy are very important especially when considering 
the number of sections to be examined with the alternative stabilisation measures. 
The limitations and the accuracy of a method must be taken into account, but the 
most critical parameters are the type failure, the prediction of the layer, that 
accommodates the planar part of the failure, and the corresponding shear  strength.

Direction of Failure Surface Development 
In most cases, the mining personnel consider the formation of a crack, close to the 
slope crest, as the first sign of an impending slip. Even in most geo-mechanical 
textbooks, it is not clear where a slope failure starts from. It is implied that the 
development of the failure surface starts from the tension crack in the slope crest 
with gradual propagation towards the slope toe area. The investigation of the 
failure type described earlier, revealed that the development of a failure surface 
from the crest to the toe was not the case for the rim slopes of the lignite mines. 
On the contrary, it was found that the direction was the opposite, from the toe to 
the crest. The case is further explained from the measurements of inclinometer 
No16 shown in Fig. 5. This inclinometer was installed in the middle of a 120 m 
high slope, well before any displacement took place. The excavator mined a 20m 

142 
M. Leonardos
 
high bench in the front of the inclinometer during the period June - July, leaving 
another 23m to the lignite floor. At that time, a failure surface started at the depth 
of 92m from the casing top, which coincided with the lignite floor. From then 
onwards, the displacement at the failure surface had a constant velocity of about 
12mm/month, a figure which has been also confirmed by surveying methods.  
The top of the slope was cleaned by dozers for better crack detection. After 
careful and regular inspection of the area, the first thin crack was detected in June 
of next year, ten months after the first displacement has taken place in the 
inclinometer. 
This early appearance of displacements in inclinometers was confirmed 
afterwards, in other slopes with different heights and geology. 
The above model of failure surface development is similar to the model 
proposed by Fleming & Johnson (1989) for translational landslides. The 
observations presented earlier, suggested that the slipping at the planar surface 
causes an increase in the tensile stresses in the masses above, turning the failure 
surface tip towards the slope crest.  Muller & Martel (2000) came up with the 
same conclusion analysing translational landslides by numerical methods. They 
also anticipated that their conclusions apply also to compound slides exploiting 
pre-existing planes of weakness. The relevant findings in the lignite mines 
strongly support this claim.

Monitoring Method 
The type of failure, which is compound consisting of a nearly horizontal surface 
and a curved one at the back, permits the proper monitoring by simple surveying 
methods, that can be easily incorporated in the mining activities. The most 
common method is the distance measurement (using EDM instruments) between a 
distant, fixed point and various target (reflectors) placed on the slope. Afterwards, 
three diagrams can be drawn for each point vers time(see Figure 6):

 While the cumulative displacement gives a good indication, the acceleration is 
useful only for the last days before slope collapse. So, the displacement velocity 
was found as the best criterion for failure condition estimation.

Time Estimation of Slope Failure Collapse 
After analysis of five events, it was found that, in case the velocity is steadily 
increasing above the level of 20 mm/day, the slope failure collapse is expected to 
occur 6 to 12 days after the velocity exceeded the level of 20 mm/day. Most of the 
slopes collapsed hours after reaching the velocity of about 100 mm/day but other 
«survived» under velocities up to 600 mm/day without severe damage. This 
difference in slope behaviour is attributed to the variation of the residual shear 
strength of the failure surface clays with the rate of displacement (Tika et al. 
1996). There are clays which exhibit a reduction of the residual shear strength for 
shearing rates above 100 mm/day. Furthermore, the displacement velocity can be 
used as a guide for stabilization measures timing and improvements in safety 
environment. 
 Statistical treatment of the measurements shows that the slope velocity, for the 
last 15 - 20 days before slope collapse, complies with the following exponential 
low: 
                                  V=a+bet/c 
 (1) 
Where   V :    Slope velocity in mm/day 
 
    a, b, c:      Parameters 
 
    t :    Time in days 
 The parameter a represents a velocity level, above it accelerating movements 
are expected («a failure onset point»). Parameter b has no physical meaning and 
its value depends only on the time measuring starting point. Parameter c is related 
to the acceleration, the lower the value the steeper the velocity curve after the 
failure onset point. 
 The values for a and c parameters are given in Table I. As the cases analysed 
are from different pits, the noticeable small values spread can be attributed to the 
common failure mechanism.

5.3 
Retrogressive Failures 
Not all the slope movements, even with high velocity, indicate an impending 
collapse. In many cases, where  the slope after a bench excavation has a sufficient 
safety factor, the slope velocity, after a peak, returns to a low value. These 
retrogressive failures exhibit two phases: 
a. Acceleration phase (the velocity increases), attributed to the fast lowering of 
the safety factor caused usually by the pit deepening in the front of the failure 
or by the water level rise in the failure cracks during heavy rainfalls. 
b. Deceleration phase (the velocity decreases), which  follows the withdrawal of 
the displacement cause. 
 The retrogressive failures follow the same exponential low and the values for a 
and c parameters are also given in Table I. 
 The values presented in Table I reveal some interesting points: 
$ The acceleration phase of a retrogressive failure start at significant lower 
velocity compared to the failure (collapse) onset point.  
$ The deceleration phase turns out with a higher velocity than at the starting point 
of a retrogressive failure acceleration phase. This shows the detrimental effect 
of the movements to slope condition. 
$  The acceleration phase of a retrogressive failure is faster than the deceleration 
phase. 
Some other interesting observation data concerning the slope failure kinematics 
are the following: 
Total displacement up to crack formation at the slope crest:
200 - 300 mm
Minimum total displacement up to slope collapse: 
700 mm
Maximum total displacement without slope collapse: 
9000 mm
Maximum velocity for a retrogressive failure: 
205 mm/day
6 
Practical Implications 
The above findings can be easily exploited for practical purposes such as for the 
early failure detection, design of stabilisation measures, slope monitoring etc.  
The first step is to take advantage of the early formation of the planar part of 
the failure surface. This is accomplished by constructing at least two inclinometers 
per section to be checked, when 30 - 50% of the total slope height has been 
excavated. In the case of a failure surface at the lignite floor, this method gives a 
clear picture months, or even a year, before the crack formation at the slope crest. 
In the case of a compound slip, controlling the stability by modification of the 
slope inclination is less effective than in the case of a circular slip. Slope 
flattening, where compound slips occur, it is not the best measure to take 
considering effectiveness and money to be spent or income to be lost. 

146 
M. Leonardos
 
Unfortunately, there are cases where slope inclination is the only parameter which 
can be changed in order to improve stability. 
Some of the failures developed in the rim slopes of the deep lignite mines are 
deliberately left to collapse because stabilisation is not feasible, either technically 
or economically. The time estimation of a mine slope failure collapse can be used 
to maximize the operation of the mine in the failure area without decreasing the 
safety level. 
The slope kinematics together with the proper stability calculations can be used 
to distinguish a failure being in the collapse or retrogressive stage.  
When mining in the front of a retrogressive failure, the slope maximum 
displacement velocity must be determined to avoid the transition from 
retrogressive to progressive failure. Mining is suspended when the velocity 
exceeds this level. The modelling of the retrogressive failure can be used for 
optimization of mining / suspension periods. It can be proved that keeping this 
maximum displacement velocity to a lower level, more time is given to excavators 
to mine in the front of the failure. 
7 
Conclusions 
Miners, throughout the mining industry, recognize some signs of geomechanical 
phenomena as precursors of impending rock or soil mass failure and collapse. In 
surface mining, it is the crack formation, while for underground mining it is the 
convergence of the excavation. Every experienced miner would agree with the 
following statements: 
$ Slope failures do not occur spontaneously and 
$ A slope failure does not occur without warning. 
This paper goes a step further for the rim slopes of the deep lignite pits: 
Impending slope failures can be detected and analysed long before any crack 
formation at the slope crest becomes visible. In addition, there are simple tools for 
failure monitoring, making the personal opinion and guesswork worthless. It is 
very important that the mining people skills cover the requirements of a slope 
monitoring system, thus the new task can be easily incorporated in mining. 
Obviously, the first benefit from the early failure detection and the slope 
monitoring is an improved safety environment. The second is the deeper 
understanding and better control of the slope stability in the mine. The latter is 
often materialized with the application of steeper final slopes without decreasing 
the safety level. Both benefits have a positive effect in the mine economics, thus 
the money paid for an improved slope stability can be considered as good 
investment.

Problem Information on the Innovative Method HDD 
An important reason for the existence of bank slides in natural terrains or in 
engineered dam excavations is that the water banks up and destroys engineered 
installations and soil by excessive moisturisation. The problem is usually solved 
by building drainage facilities – vertical filtration wells, horizontal segments and 
drill holes. The wells and segments have several major disadvantages. The vertical 
drill holes have a limited effective radius. This requires small spacings in-
between, a large volume and expensive drilling work. Horizontal drillings require 
an initial shaft or a protective ditch for the drilling equipment, which is difficult to 
lay and is limited to drainage pipes of a maximum length of 100–150 m. To avoid 
the shortfalls of the filtration and drainage installations mentioned above the 
method HDD has been devised and introduced. In Germany, more than 15%-18% 
of the cable, pipe and filtration networks that may vary in type and purpose are 
installed without excavations (1). This is the so-called “Subsoil Revolution”. 
The essence is as follows: set-up in a ramp at a starting point a straight or 
curvilinear drilling is carried out by a controllable cutting drill head that uses a 
water jet with a pressure of 30 - 1.500 bar which penetrates the soil. When the 
pilot drilling has reached the final location the drill head is replaced by an 
extension head. There a pipe run is attached consisting of a protective, filtration 
and drainage pipe. On the return path the bore is expanded and the combined pipe 
run is inserted, which is pulled out all the way back to the pilot drilling. The last 
stage consists of the pulling out of the protective pipes in reverse from the final 
location which keeps the drainage filtration run in the bore to fulfil its function. 
In order to realize the HDD method different installations with the following 
specifications are used: maximum hoist power 50-1000kN, maximum length of 
the drill pipe 250-2000m, maximum drilling depth 12-300m. 
A significant positive feature of this method is the option to effect curvilinear 
clearing drillings. In this, cable and pipe runs are inserted according to the defined 
goal adapted to the concrete characteristics of the soil environment. This method

is suited for the application in large-scale draining of saturated and non-saturated 
rocks in slide-endangered banks.

Analysis of the Introduction of the HDD Method  
in Germany Open-Pit Mines. (3,4) 
The theoretical and experimental examinations and the introduction of horizontal 
drillings were started at the end of the last century, mainly for the laying of subsoil 
networks without ditch and to rehabilitate waste dumps. 
Drainage is an important process in pits especially when the excavation is done 
in bedrock where water amounts to over 5m3 /t. Expenses and repercussions on the 
environment are significant. At the moment, vertical drillings are the preferred 
drainage method (preliminary drainage) in open-pit mines. In thin, aquifers the 
filter location is of limited effect. The maximum pump capacity from a drilling is 
1-2m3 /min, where each one is equipped with a pump and an electrical installation. 
To achieve this goal major investments for the setting-up and expenditure for 
energy and labour are required. Instead of using vertical filters horizontal filter 
well drillings were used. The results of the laboratory and field tests have been 
described (2). It is also the technical basis for investments in technological 
variants of the HDD used for drilling operations in open-pit mines.  
The comparative technological configuration for the drainage of an aquifer is 
illustrated in figure 1.

drillings (3)

Obvious is the uniformity of the lowered water level in the case of the 
horizontal drillings. The water infiltrated in them drains off in a gravitating way. 
What is more, a larger zone of developed deposits is created. One HDD drilling 
can replace 30 or more vertical drillings. The result is a substantial reduction in 
materials, energy and a concentration on the drainage process without an 
interruption of the mining operations in the open-pit mine. 
It has become evident that existing calculation methods are not suitable to 
evaluate the reliability of the drainage effect. 
For an ore mine 10 drillings in rows are usually required. 
To this end a reverse modeling based on a laboratory test (at the Institute for 
Geotechnical-engineering at T.U. Bergakademie Freiberg) has been carried out, 
and a field test in the lignite mine “Vereignigtes Schleenhein” based on single 
horizontal drillings. The results of this modelling went to confirm the methods to 
calculate the effects of draining of the calculation model of PCGEOFM® (4). 
Here the current in the HDD drillings was regarded as a stream whose capacity 
depends on a number of parameters: basic parameters are the length of the drilling 
filter and the strength of the colmated layer.

Rehabilitating Waste Dumps to Protect Them against 
Disintegration Including the Possibility to Enlarge Their 
Capacity 
In Bulgaria, in mining and processing raw materials billions of sterile rocks are 
piled up. A large number of the dumps were built 40-50 years ago. There is 
probability that they are destroyed in their elements by destructive processes. The 
dry dumps are often set up on unlevelled, undrained surfaces that have no 
appropriate slope. The hydro dumps (tailing pond) have scooping facilities, a poor 
drainage system and colmated drainage. In the case of these two methods there is 
or we expect an increase of the piezometric level in the slopes in case of the first 
methods and the dams in case of the second method. 
In the case of dry damps slow water saturation and subsequent, sliding of the 
banks leads to significant economic and ecological damage. The rehabilitation of 
the colmated drainage system in the hydro damps is virtually impossible. As a 
result, the piezometric level increases; the capacity of the drainage system is 
reduced. There is a risk for the dams breaking and of a discharge of gigantic 
amounts of dump material with unforeseeable economic and ecological 
consequences. The undrained state, i.e. the water saturation of the banks and 
dams, excludes the possibility to enlarge their capacity. The enlargement of the 
existing dumps saves resources, land and social efforts. 
The examples given above illustrated in figures 2a and 2b demonstrate the 
advantages of the horizontal drainage drillings. They allow a periodic cleansing of 
the colmated material.

For any concrete case it is necessary to devise ideas and elaborate a working 
project taking into consideration the elements of the draining systems. The 
capacities of the discharge and the effect of the drying drainage process are 
determined by the diameter and the length of the filters and the spacing between 
drillings. 
The horizontal drainage drillings in dry and hydro dumps as well as the 
collectors of the latters are colmated in the course of time. 
The result is a reduction of the draining or the complete colmatage of the 
drillings. The current innovative methods are first used for the observations 
registered and second for the cleansing of the colmated areas in horizontal and 
sloped drillings.  
 

Innovative Methods to Improve Stability in Dumps and to Enlarge of Their Capacity 
153
 
 
The first method is the “Supervision®” system. It allows an internal inspection 
of the channels of all kinds by using optical chambers fitted on a trolley. They can 
move in channels and drillings with a diameter of 100mm to 1500mm. To enable 
optimal inspection of the inside of the drilling the chamber head can be rotated 
using a small lever. The picture is transmitted from the inside onto a computer 
screen by cable. The trolleys are SVR9S, SVR140, SVR150 und SVR SA140 with 
a weight of 8kg to 25kg. Figure 4 shows the trolley SVR250 with the optical 
camera Supervision®. 
 
Fig. 4 Trolley SVR20 with optical camera Supervision® (5) 
Unless regularly cleaned small crystalline inner deposits are found on the walls 
of the channels (figure 5). 
The second method to clean the colmated inner surfaces is to clear by water jets 
with a pressure of 150bar. Market leader is Rohrtechnologie KMG. In the process, 
the highly-effective turbine jet with a combined pressuring and sucking effect with 
a maximum length of the jetting hose of 1000m and an output of 320l/min. It has 
proved to clean channels with a length of 620m, diameter 250mm and a slope of 
up to 30° (7)

Conclusion 
1. Radical drying of the burden rock is realized by horizontal, inclined clearing 
drillings which are technically and economically more effective than 
vertical drainage drillings, filtration wells and tunnels 
2. Slow, unnoticed increase of the piezometric level in the banks of the dry 
waste dumps needs to controlled and decreased by horizontal/inclined 
drainage drillings plus observation and cleaning systems. The dried burden 
material in the banks reduces its volume weight, cohesion is stepped up and 
also its angle of internal friction. As a result the coefficient of the resisting 
force is increased. The final result is the possibility of additional amounts of 
overburden so that the capacity of the dump can be enlarged. 
3. Currently, the HDD method is the only possibility to rehabilitate the 
colmated drainage systems in tailing ponds. In doing so, one can attain the 
decrease of the piezometric level and the risk of the breaking of the dams.

Research on the Optimal Technology  
for Exploitation of the Thin Lignite Layers  
in the Open Pits from Oltenia Coalfield 
Maria Lazar and Andras Iosif 
University of Petrosani, Romania 
Abstract. The lignite deposits from Oltenia’s mining area consist of several 
lignite layers, separated by sterile formations. The thickness of the coal layers, as 
well the sterile intercalations varies in a wide enough range, not only among the 
entire coalfield, but even in the same exploitation field. Taking into account the 
geological specificities of the deposit and the large number of open pits in which 
is extracted, the analysis of the opportunity to introduce highly selective extraction 
of thin layers in each open pit is difficult because of the large amount of calculations 
to be performed. For this reason, in this paper an open pit model is discussed, in 
which the selective extraction of a thin lignite layer is analyzed, in terms of different 
layer thicknesses and three different lengths of the exploitation front. In order to 
determine the influence of layer thickness and front length on the main economic 
indicators of the exploitation activity, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, 
on the proposed open pit model the sensitivity analysis realized, which takes into 
consideration three different extraction technologies: nonselective extraction, limited 
selective extraction and highly selective extraction. In order to establish the optimal 
technological variant for extracting of the thin lignite layers in various concrete 
conditions (length of the exploitation front, layer thicknesses) a flexible multi-
criteria multi-attribute type optimization method has been used, namely the 
weighted average maximization method. In order to generalize the conducted study 
for  other  concrete exploitation conditions (front length and coal layer thickness), a 
nomograph has been drawn-out based on the extrapolation of the calculated values 
and on the regression equations of the curves representing the  separation limit 
between optimal zones.

Problem Statement 
The goal of a high as possible selective extraction is to improve the quality of the 
throughput coal while reducing at the minimum possible the losses of coal [5]. In 
the case of lignite deposits being mined out in Oltenia’s open pits, two situations 
occur which requires a high backhoe-hydraulic shovel selective extraction to 
fulfill the above-mentioned goals.  
The first case refers to the extraction of thin seams, which occurs relatively 
seldom in the overburden rocks, when the outcome of such an extraction is the 

158

avoidance of losses and reduction of the dilution. The second case is 
representative for the fascicular type seams, when many coal banks are separated 
by sterile intercalations.  
In order to illustrate the effect of the selective extraction in the second case, we 
present below an example based on a case study. In this view, we consider a sector 
from a bench  in which a lignite seam containing 5 coal layers separated by sterile 
intercalations (as in table 1) is to be mined out. We consider a length of a block of 
1000 m, and its width equal to annual advance of the face, i.e. 200 m.

Variant 1 – Non-selective extraction  
In this case, the equipment utilized is a Bucket Wheel Excavator (BWE), which 
cannot extract separately the sterile and the coal. As a result, from the entire block 
1.9 mil. m3 coal-sterile mixture will be extracted , with an average ash content of  
47.07%. The average ash content A av can be calculated as a weighted average 
using the formula:

We can notice a high ash content of the throughput, because of mixing the coal 
with sterile rock, while the losses in this case are zero.  
 
Variant 2 – Limited -selective extraction  
In this case, we can utilize a smaller BWE, a hydraulic shovel or a Krupp Surface 
Miner. The throughput obtained from the entire block, in this case will be 540000 m3 
of lignite with an ash content of 38.78 % and 820000 m3 of lignite with an ash 
content of 43.60 % while the loss of coal with reduced ash content will be 140000 m3.  
Variant 3 – High -selective extraction  
This variant requires the utilization of Continuous Surface Miners, which are able 
to extract thin layers; in this case, the coal will be extracted without dilution, 
obtaining 1.2 mil. m3 of lignite with an ash content of 28.53 %, while the losses 
are zero. Another advantage of high-selective extraction is that the ash content can 
be controlled, and the mixing in the Power plant stockpile in order to provide a 
constant quality coal is easy.

Sensitivity Analysis Based on an Open Pit Mine Model 
2.1 
The Model Construction  
The Oltenia’s coalfield lignite is mainly composed by many coal seams separated 
by sterile rock layers. Both the coal seams and sterile layers have a large variance 
of the thickness, not only inside the entire basin, but also inside the same 
perimeter.  
Taking into account the characteristics of the coalfield and the large number of 
operating open pits, introducing the high selective extraction in each mine is 
difficult, because of their mentioned variability. For this reason, we will 
demonstrate the advantages of the high-selective extraction method we propose a 
surrogate model, in which the goal is to extract a thin coal seam, with different 
thicknesses, for three different values of the face length.  
Related to the lignite properties, we consider a medium hardness of coal, the 
allowable wall slope is considered to be 45o. The specific weight is considered to 
be γv = 1.3 t/m3 and the bulk factor ka= 1.35. 
The main “in situ” content parameters of the lignite are: 
- Heating value, Qi= 1900 kcal/kg; 
- Ash content, Aanh= 22.5%; 
- Total moisture Wt= 35%.

The seam thickness “m” and face length “L” varies in the following ranges: 
• 
Thickness : 0.2 m; 0.4 m; 0.6 m; 0.8 m; 1.0 m; 1.2 m; 1.4 m; 1.6 m; 1.8 m. 
• 
Face length: 700 m; 1000 m; 1500 m. 
The working bench is considered as: height h=25 m, slope angle α=45o, the 
coal seam is located in the middle of the bench height, regardless its thickness. 
Also we consider that the overburden of the block has been removed in due time, 
without influence on extraction activity.  
The working time is two shifts per day, with 260 days/year, which means an 
amount of available working hours of tplan= 4160 hours /year. If we consider a 
coefficient of charge ηe=0.9, the operating time is tef= 3744 hours/year. 
2.2 
Extraction Using Surface Miner 
The Wirtgen 2100 SM surface miner has been chosen for high –selective 
extraction modeling [8, 9]. Having in mind the open pit mine model described, 
using the productivity calculation algorithm for this technology, we plotted the 
dependence of annual production as a function of seam thickness, m and different 
face lengths, as in figure 1.  
 
Fig. 1 Dependence of annual production on seam thickness and face length 
From the above presented diagram, we can conclude that in case of SM, the 
annual production is mainly influenced by the face length and less by the 
thickness of the seam [3]. That is due to the fact that as the face is longer, as the 

Research on the Optimal Technology for Exploitation of the Thin Lignite Layers 
161
 
 
unproductive time consumption for slice-end maneuvers. The influence of seam 
thickness on the annual output is not very significant, except the fact that in the 
small thickness range the decrease of output is   more evident, while in greater 
thickness range the output increase trends towards zero, asymptotically, or can 
take even negative values, also due to longer time for face-end instrumentations. 
The dependences shown in fig. 1, being determined starting from discrete points, 
so we can derive by regression a general equation as:

Using this equation, we are able to calculate the maximal output that can be 
obtained with this technology for any value of the face length and seam thickness.  
In order to derive the economic efficiency of the CSM technology, we 
estimated the specific extraction costs, for the first year of operation, and for the 
next five years, ignoring only the eventually maintenance (repair) costs, taking 
into account that the manufacturer guarantees a good functioning of  20000 hours, 
which means six years. In figure 2.a, we plotted the specific cost dependence on 
face length and seam thickness for the first year, while in figure 2.b the same, for 
the next five years.  
 
 
Fig. 2 Specific cost dependence on seam thickness and face length: a) first year; b) next 
five years 
The analysis highlights that the highest specific costs are obtained at reduced 
thickness and reduced face lengths. The face length influence is more important 
than the thickness one. In order to have a calculable formula, we used same as 
above the regression, obtaining the formula below:

In the conditions of the used model, we notice that in the first year, the specific 
costs are in the range from 11.408$/t (for L = 700 m and m=0.2 m) to 10.319 $/t 
(for = 1500 m and m = 1,8 m), and in the next years, after recovery of the initial 
investment they decrease  to 1.797 $/t (for L = 700 m and m = 0,2 m) and to 1,629 
$/t (for L = 1500 m and m = 1,8 m).

2.3 
Extraction Using Backhoe-Hydraulic Shovel  
For the considered open pit mine model, a backhoe-hydraulic shovel is proposed, 
(PROMEX S/SC/ 3602), with bucket capacity of 1,8 m3, which will work in 
parallel with the SchRs 1400 BWE, without interfering with this main digging 
equipment. The BWE will extract the overburden and sterile intercalations, while 
the shovel the coal layers [2]. The option for a backhoe is due to its advantage in 
given conditions, in comparison with the face type ones. In figure 3 the annual 
production as a function of seam thickness and face lengths is plotted.  
 
Fig. 3 The annual production as a function of seam thickness and face length 
From the above, we can notice that, contrarily with the CSM technology, the 
productivity, i.e. the annual output in the case of hydraulic shovel are less 
influenced by the face length and more by the seam thickness. Also, the output 
decrease with the increase of the face length, which is due to the increased hauling 
distances with increased face lengths, the haulage of the coal extracted with 
shovels being realized with trucks. Another difference is that beyond a certain 
value of the seam thickness, the output decreases, after reaching a maximal value. 
The regression equation of the output dependence on seam thickness and face 
length is given by (4).

Regarding the economic efficiency issue, we proceeded in the same way as in 
case of CSM adapted to some specific elements of this technology, as follows: 
- no need to investment  expenses, because all the open pits  in the Oltenia’s 
coalfield are endowed with hydraulic shovels used in auxiliary operations; 

Research on the Optimal Technology for Exploitation of the Thin Lignite Layers 
163
 
 
- the incomes were calculated taking into account a dilution of ca. 10% because of 
the weaker selectivity allowed in the case of this technology, so we considered a 
heating value of 1710 kcal/kg instead of 1900 kcal/kg, as in case of pure coal.  
As a result, we obtained the total costs (figure 4) and the specific costs  
(figure 5). The regression equation of the dependence of specific costs on face 
length and seam thickness is given in (5):

We can notice that the specific costs are relatively reduced, being in the range 
of 3,041 $/t for thickness of 0.2 m and face length of 1500 m to 1.127 $/t for 
thickness of 1.8 m and face length of 700 m.

Extraction with Small BWE  
For this technology, given the strata conditions, we considered a SRs 130-9/0.5 
Bucket Wheel Excavator. The possible obtainable outputs were determined, taking 
into account the inherent productivity decrease of this type of equipment with the 
decrease of the seam thickness [4]. 
The dependence of the BWE’s productivity taking into account the excavated 
face height and the geometric elements of  the obtained cut shape is shown in 
figure 6, which is influenced by the amount of  uptimes and downtimes imposed 
by the above mentioned parameters.  
 
Fig. 6 Productivity and time-share of BWE operation on excavated height 
From the figure, we can notice that technically, the BWE is able to excavate a 
face of minimal height of 0.4 m with a productivity significantly reduced 
compared with the nominal one, (112.2 m3/h relative to 350 m3/h which is 
guaranteed by the manufacturer). The productivity increases with the increase of 
the height of cut being close to the nominal value at a height of ca. 3.0 m. From 
the diagram of times, it results very clearly the dependence of total time with the 
times to change from one slice to another, and a constant value of change from 
one block to another.   

Research on the Optimal Technology for Exploitation of the Thin Lignite Layers 
165
 
 
Based on productivity diagrams shown below, we derived the total annual 
output as a function of face length and seam thickness, as shown in figure 7. 
 
 
Fig. 7 Total annual output as a function of face length and seam thickness 
We notice that the output slowly decreases with the increase of the face length, 
due to the contribution of downtimes imposed by the change of slice, respectively 
the block and the increase of time for translating the belt conveyor with the 
increase of the face length.  
The regression equation of the dependence of the output with the face length 
and the seam thickness is given in (6):

Taking into account an investment for the SRs 130 - 9/0,5 BWE at 2000000 $, 
we derived the specific costs in the first year and the following years after 
recovery of investment, and a 12 % dilution, (1625 kcal/kg) for the incomes, 
which are presented in figures 8 and 9.

Analyzing the results above presented, we notice that the specific costs are in 
the range of 3.69 – 7.82 $/t in the first year, when the investment is recovered, and 
in the future years the specific costs are between 1.19 – 2.53 $/t.  
If we add the transportation expenses, we obtain a range of 7.69 – 11.82 $/t in 
the first year and a range of 5.19 – 6.53 $/t in the following years.

Establishment of the Optimal Extraction Technology for 
Thin Seams 
In order to obtain the optimal technology for a given range of face lengths and 
seam thicknesses, we used a multi-criteria – multi-attribute flexible optimization 
technique, based on weighted average maximization [7, 11]. 
This method implies the following steps: 
 
• selecting a set of criteria and a set of variants  
• normalization of data using:

Following the steps described above, we obtained the chart in figure 10 
describing the optimal choice of solution, for the combinations of seam thickness 
and face length.  
The results obtained following this sensitivity analysis on the described open 
pit model, lead to the conclusion that in the range of reduced seam thickness the 
most efficient technology is the use of Wirtgen SM. The area of application of this 
technology extends towards larger thicknesses, with the increase of the face 
length, as we can see in figure 10. The use of hydraulic shovel is efficient  until 
the thickness value of 1.2 m, and the small BWE became efficient for  thickness 
greater than 1.2 m, regardless the face length.

Fig. 10 Chart for establishing the optimal extraction technology to be used  
Based on the chart presented in figure 10, we have drawn up a nomograph, in 
which the optimality area can be determined for continuous ranges of thickness 
and face length, which is presented in figure 11. This nomograph uses the 
regression equations established before. The curves represent the border of 
separation between the areas of optimality of different technologies.

The optimal technology for a given value of face length and thickness is given 
by the area in which the corresponding horizontal line of thickness crosses the 
vertical line of the face length. If the intersection point is situated on a borderline, 
then the both variants must be analyzed, using supplementary criteria. After 
selection of the optimal technology, the actual outputs and the costs can be derived 
using the corresponding regression equations.

Conclusions 
In order to improve the quality of the throughput coal while reducing at the 
minimum possible the losses of coal, in the case of lignite deposits being mined 
out in Oltenia’s open pits, two occurring situations, which require a high selective 
extraction must be considered. 
The first case refers to the extraction of thin seams, which occurs relatively 
seldom in the overburden rocks, when the outcome of such an extraction is the 
avoidance of losses and reduction of the dilution. The second case is 
representative for the fascicular type seams, when many coal banks are separated 
by sterile intercalations.  
Using the experience of a concrete situation, in which we encounter both these 
situations, three technological solutions are drawn-up, with different degrees of 
selectivity, analyzing the pros and cons of each. The three solutions envisaged are, 
apart from the actual , non selective method, using large BWE-s,  with different 
selectivity degree, namely using Continuous Surface Miners, backhoe hydraulic 
shovels and small sized BWE.  
In order to make the comparison possible, a simple surrogate model of open pit 
is presented, and the three technologies are analyzed, deriving the main technical, 
economical and qualitative results.  
The areas of optimality of these technologies are derived using a multi-
attribute-multi-criteria flexible optimization method, namely the weighted average 
maximization method.  
In order to generalize the conducted study for various concrete exploitation 
conditions (front length and coal layer thickness), a nomograph has been drawn-
out based on the extrapolation of the calculated values and on the regression 
equations of the curves representing separation limit between optimal zones.

Substantiation of Continuous Equipment 
Efficient Choice at the Selective Mining  
of Passing Minerals

Abstract. Article deals with the actuality problem of continuous equipment 
efficient choice at the open cast mining when selective mining deposits. Analyses 
the advantage of bucket wheel excavators using at the selective mining of passing 
minerals. The parameters of face cut and bucket wheel that allow to increase the 
effectiveness of selective extraction technology by the bucket wheel excavator is 
calculated. The dependence of the rational use of bucket-wheel excavator types on 
it bucket width is determined. The results of the conducted researches show that 
the excavation of overburden layers with thicknesses that equal or more then 
selection degree is effective.  
An integral feature of the mining process and reprocessing of minerals is waste 
and passing products, most of which is a raw material for various industries. The 
quality, technological and economic limits that separating raw materials from 
passing mining waste rock are conditional and have noticeable fluctuations in 
time. These changes depend on the needs of social production in each type of raw 
material, as well as technical and technological possibilities to satisfy it. 
The industry transfer to intensive development level predetermines the need to 
implement resource management forms of multiply use of mineral resources and 
entering in the production passing minerals. 
Effectiveness of selective extraction technique depends on the continuous 
mining conditions of attitude bad, physical and mechanical properties of mining 
rocks, the type of the equipment excavation, technological parameters of the 
mining and other factors. 
The advantage of bucket wheel excavators in the selective extraction of passing 
minerals is that they provide a consistent removal of overburden layers from the 
crest to toe of bench. 
Transportation of passing minerals are supplying to the console spreader, which 
allows one to selectively store the material in man-caused deposit to further use. 
For this process is necessary the consistency of movements between cutting and 
overburden equipments. 
Effectiveness field of selective extraction using a bucket-wheel excavator are 
determined in the mining layer capacity (the height of the chip). If the thickness of 
the layer less than half of the bucket-wheel diameter it can lead to a decrease in 
cutting productivity.

Selective extraction technology of passing minerals by the bucket-wheel 
excavator and its efficient is heavily dependent on the type of stope face, the form 
of chips, the parameters of bucket wheel. For selective mining more acceptable 
bucket wheel excavators low power with small diameter wheels.

where ξО – 1,2 – 2,8 is attitude of layer thickness tО toward its width bO at the 
level of wheel ax. 
Rational at the mining rock by bucket-wheel excavator there is a condition, 
when t : b ≈ 1, where b is a bucket width. Development of passing minerals is 
made the vertical, horizontal chips and combined method depending on the 
fortress of the developed rocks. For example, the horizontal chips are develop 
dense rocks. Power intensity of selective mining, dynamics of loadings on a rotor 
and specific resistance digging at a mining vertical chips on 10 – 30% less than, 
than at a coulisse horizontal. During mining the vertical layers the productivity 
will be nominal, if power of one layer is equal (0,5 – 0,7)D [1]. Then hE ≥ 0,5D, 
where D is a diameter of bucket-wheel. 
At development the horizontal chips variants are possible: 
1 – when hE accept the equal height of cutting edge of bucket t = 0,08D;  
2 – when hE accept equal to a few heights of cutting edge of bucket. Then 
0,08D < hE < 0,5D.

On the pit when mining horizontal deposits of Nikopolskiy manganese ore, 
Dneprovskiy lignite, Pre-Carpathians sulfur pools for the development of 
overburden rocks the next bucket-wheel excavators are used: ERShR-1600-40/7, 
ERG-1600-40/10, SRS-2400-40/4, SRS-2400-35/9, ERG-1600-40/7, ShRS-1500-
24/6, ER-1250, SRS-280-II/0,5 and RS-350. 
For these machines, and the specific conditions of the development of pools 
below shows the procedure for determining the main parameters of selective 
mining.  
It should be noted that the main indicator of the effectiveness of selective 
excavation is the lower limit of the effective recessed power (the degree of 
selection) – the minimum thickness of the layer of overburden, which is suitable 
for recess technical capabilities used excavators. 
To establish it is necessary to calculate the change in productivity excavation 
equipment and slaughter coefficient depending on the height executed by layer for 
each type considered a bucket-wheel excavator. 
Technical productivity of the bucket wheel excavator is  
QT = QP·kR·kF, m3/h,

where QP – theoretical productivity of bucket wheel excavator, m3/h; kR – 
influence rock coefficient; kF – coefficient of mining face. 
To determine kR the need to calculate a index of difficulties mining rock in face 
(PER), passport indicator difficulties mining (PEP) and compare it with each other 
[2]. If PER > PEP then coefficient kR = 1.

The determination of index kR was made for all excavators were considered and 
found that for it kR = 1, since the conditions of occurrence of approximately equal

Excavator with a small bucket (up to 6.5 m) values of ΔkF and ΔQT also 
significantly differ with increasing layer height. Thus, for the excavator ER-1250 
the gap height from 1 to 2.5 m values of ΔkF and ΔQT constitute, correspondingly, 
0,216 and 276 m3/h, while increasing the height from 2.5 to 6 m – 0.085 and 66 
m3/h, correspondingly. Similarly set value ΔkF and ΔQT for excavator SRS-280 
and RS-350, for which their sharp change in the (increase) was observed at a 
height of 2 m and 3 m, correspondingly. 
Thus, based on the results of the analysis of changes in the values ΔkF and ΔQT 
executed by the height of the layer set the following next values of the degree of 
selection: for excavators ERShR-1600, SRS-1500, SRS-2400, ERG-1600 and 
CDS -2400 it is 4 m, for RS-350 – 3 m, ER-1250 – 2.5 m and SRS-280 – 2 m.

Results in Table 1 show that the volume of overburden blocks, the mining of a 
one point distances, for powerful bucket-wheel excavators with the highest degree 
of selection are relatively large and the mining time change from 7.7 to 18.9 hours 
depending on the type of excavator. This indicates sufficiently the effectiveness of 
selective extraction of overburden by bucket-wheel excavator. 
Conducted researches on determining the degree of selection confirmed the fact 
that the layers of overburden excavation capacity equal or biggest than degree of 
selection, is effective and does not involve decrease of productivity bucket-wheel 
complexes and give a real supposition for the subsequent dumping of separate 
passing minerals.

Abstract. The deposit modelling and evaluation and the mineable reserves 
estimation of multi-seam lignite deposits is an essential process for mine planning 
activities. The first approach of the original drill holes data evaluation of the 
exploration programs refers to the analysis of the in-situ lignite seams 
characteristics. The algorithm of compositing of the drill holes assay intervals 
should take into account specific criteria of evaluation based on the corresponding 
power plant specifications as well as on the applied mining equipment. Especially 
in the case of continuous surface mining, the accuracy of the mineable reserves 
and the run-of-mine lignite quality estimation is a very important subject of mine 
planning and design procedure, provided that the applied equipment is less 
flexible to operation changes regarding the short-term scheduling.  
The objective of this paper is the investigation of the critical parameters which 
affect the lignite deposit evaluation procedure in relation to the algorithms of 
mineable reserves and run-of-mine lignite quality estimation in multi-seam 
continuous surface lignite mines.  The analysis is based on a wide range of 
deposits, power plants and equipment parameters.  Emphasis is placed on the 
spatial variability of the lignite deposit parameters and on the recommended 
design criteria as well as on mine development improvements.

Introduction 
The electricity production system in Greece is mainly based, at a percentage of 
about 50%, on lignite exploitation in surface mines.  The majority of the lignite 
deposits has a multiple-layered structure (Fig. 1) and is located in the Ptolemais - 
Amynteon basin, in the area of Western Macedonia, in northern Greece.

Fig. 1 Typical multiple-layered structure of lignite deposits with data of a corresponding 
drill-hole (Barmpas, 2013). 
The need for a high production rate and selective mining resulted in the main 
application of the continuous surface mining method, using large-scale equipment 
(high capacity bucket wheel excavators, conveyor belts and spreaders). In 
addition, non-continuous mining equipment (consisting of blast hole drills, 
dumpers, loaders, dozers and other auxiliary units) is utilized for mining the hard 
and semi-hard rock formations, which are encountered in the overburden strata, or 
for mining deposit formations that are not effectively mined by the continuous 
mining equipment.  The non-continuous mining equipment is also utilized 
additionally in the cases that continuous mining equipment is not adequate for 
handling the required earthmoving works.   
The lignite deposit modelling and evaluation and the mineable reserves 
estimation process is an essential and a very important subject for the mine 
planning and design phase of such surface mining projects. The deposit reserves 
have a particular effect on any surface mining project, affecting the life of the 
project, the optimal capacity of the corresponding power plant, the annual 
production rate of the mine, as well as the viability of the overall project 
(Galetakis et al, 2011, Roumpos and Papakosta, 2013). Quality parameters of run-
off-mine lignite are also very important in strategic mine planning. They also 
affect the economic viability of the project, the efficiency of the power plant, the 
environmental performance of the project or the decision for the mining sequence

(Roumpos 2005, Roumpos et al., 2009). The accuracy of the mineable lignite 
reserves and the run-of-mine lignite quality estimation is, therefore, a very 
important subject of the deposit evaluation and mine planning and design 
procedure.  
The scope of the present paper includes: (a) an investigation of the parameters 
that affect the lignite deposit modelling and the evaluation results, (b) a 
description of the suggested algorithm and procedure, (c) a presentation of a case 
study regarding the mid term development of a continuous surface lignite mine, 
and (d) conclusions.

Lignite Deposit Modelling and Evaluation 
The modelling and evaluation procedure for the estimation of mineable reserves of 
multi layer lignite deposits could be divided into three main stages: (1) geologic 
modelling, (2) spatial block modelling, and (3) estimation of mineable lignite 
reserves. The flowchart of Fig. 2 shows the lignite deposit modeling and reserves 
estimation procedure, included the three stages that are discussed next in greater 
detail.   
2.1 
Geological Modelling 
The frequent alteration of clastic sediments (normally consisting of soft sediments 
such as sands, clays and marls) and lignite beds is a characteristic of the largest 
lignite deposits of Greece (Papanikolaou et al, 2004). The majority of these 
deposits are characterized by high spatial quality variability. Modern commercial 
mining software packages, usually developed for covering all mine planning and 
design activities, are not ideally adapted to that type of multiple-layered stratified 
lignite deposits. They are based on a corresponding geology module which is 
designed to build a geological model from exploration drill-holes.  
The first step in creating a geological model is the analysis and interpretation of 
the drill- holes data. This procedure includes the importing, editing, reporting and 
graphical representation of them. It goes through the various importing functions, 
checking and validating the data with queries and reports, and using various 
utilities to fix the problems encountered.  
Commonly there are differences in the available exploratory data of drill-holes. 
These are attributed to the following reasons:  
• The time period in which a drilling program is carried out is very long.  
• The descriptions of the drilling data are carried out by many different 
geologists with different knowledge base. 
• In the first years of drilling programs there was not a standardized logging 
procedure. Therefore, there is a lack of uniformity of the exploratory data.

Fig. 2 Flowchart of lignite deposit modeling and reserves estimation procedure. 
• The objective of some drill-holes is not the investigation of the whole deposit 
but of a certain problem (e.g. geotechnical, hydrogeological or other drill-
holes). 
• The descriptions of the drill-holes data may be done by geologists of 
incomplete experience. As a result, incorrect drill-hole locations, sampling and 

Mineable Lignite Reserves Estimation in Continuous Surface Mining 
181
 
analytical errors or errors in data input to databases may occur. Also, errors in 
the drilling procedure may result in core losses or in difficulties to discrete 
specific geological strata.  
• Chemical analysis of drill-holes samples may not contain values of some 
important quality parameters.  
Furthermore, large deviations from the actual data of face mapping, relating 
often to the lack of direct correlation of the lignite and waste strata, are often 
caused by the following conditions: 
• The number of layers found in exploration drill-holes in many cases is 
extremely large. 
• The quality characteristics of the lignite deposit present vertical and horizontal 
spatial variability, which is often reflected to the change in the number and 
thickness of lignite layers in the same seam. 
• The deposits are characterized by many faults with different dip directions and 
ages. Besides, many of the faults were formed at the period of sedimentation, 
affecting the characteristics of each lignite seam.  
In a first stage, the correlation procedure is mainly based on characteristic 
layers. In a second stage, the waste layers with specific characteristics or the 
lignite layers rich in carbon minerals could be separated. In this way, the 
interfaces between the characteristic lignite layers will be well defined in order to 
be used for the geological correlation and modelling Roumpos et al, 2011).  
Furthermore, taking into account the data of the structural or other geological 
information, the locations of the characteristic layers can be determined. The 
effect of tectonics to quality variation of lignite in multilayered deposits is very 
clear (Galetakis et al, 2006). Additional data could also help to create sub-groups 
of layers between characteristic formations. Geological characteristics of the 
lignite deposit and interpretations of the formation of lignite seams can enhance 
the process of lignite deposit modelling (Leontidis et al, 2001). 
2.2 
Spatial Block Modelling 
The evaluation of the mineable lignite reserves and quality is a process of 
compositing seams into blocks of exploitable lignite.  The main criteria used for 
the formation of the exploitable compositing lignite blocks are (Kavouridis et al, 
2000, Galetakis and Vasiliou, 2010)  
• Minimum thickness of lignite blocks and of waste layers that can be excavated 
by selective mining. These values mainly depend on the technical 
characteristics of the excavator, the bench geometry and the type of cutting. 
 
 
 

182
C.P. Roumpos et al. 
 
• Cut off quality of the run of mine lignite.  This criterion is closely related to the 
specifications of the power station that will be fed by the excavated lignite. In 
the past, only the upper limit of ash water free content (included CO2 in some 
cases) was used.  However, for an accurate estimation of the exploitable block, 
the lower limit of calorific value should be used additionally.  
• Dilution with waste and mining lignite loss at the top and bottom of each block. 
These parameters are used because the cutting geometry of the excavating 
machinery cannot be adjusted accurately to the geometry of the top and bottom 
surfaces of the lignite blocks.  
The compositing of seams into blocks of exploitable lignite and waste material is a 
computer-aided iterative process (Karamalikis, 1992). The evaluation of the 
exploitable lignite is based on drill-holes data and the main steps of this process 
(described in Kavouridis et al, 2000) are: 
•  Initial raw seam coding. All seams of a hole are characterised as lignite or 
waste according to their quality characteristics (ash, water content and calorific 
value).  
•  Waste blocks formation. Successive non-lignite seams are grouped to from the 
initial waste beds.  
•  Initial determination of selectively excavated waste blocks. Waste blocks 
thicker than the defined minimum thickness for selective mining are classified 
as waste blocks and cannot contribute to the formation of lignite blocks. 
•  Evaluation of exploitable lignite blocks between waste blocks. First all lignite 
and waste (embedded dilution) layers between the above-mentioned selectively 
excavated waste blocks are examined. If the total thickness of these layers is 
greater than the minimum thickness for selective excavation and their 
compositing weighting quality values satisfy the cut off quality limit of the run 
of mine lignite, then all layers are grouped to form an exploitable lignite block. 
Otherwise, the algorithm examines the possibility of forming an exploitable 
block taking into account as many layers as possible. This evaluation process is 
repeated for all the remaining seams in the borehole and in this way the 
exploitable lignite blocks are determined. For the estimation of total thickness 
and average quality parameters the surface dilution and mining loss are also 
taken in account. 
 
The compositing blocks of exploitable lignite may include thin waste layers 
while the blocks of waste material may include thin lignite layers (Fig. 3). The 
thickness he of an exploitable lignite block is estimated as the summation of all the 
individual layers, n layers of lignite, with thickness

 within the block (usually m<<n). In a similar way the value of a 
specific quality characteristic qbl of the lignite block is determined as the weighted 
average of all qi of the individual layers.

From the above described compositing procedure, it can be deducted that the 
most important parameters of the exploitable lignite blocks formation in each 
drill-hole are: 
(1) The minimum thickness of waste layers that can be excavated by selective 
mining (
min
)
(w
h
). This parameter mainly depends on the excavating 
equipment and usually is higher for non-continuous mining equipment.  
(2) The minimum thickness of lignite blocks that can be excavated by selective

included in the compositing

estimated. This usually happens with the calorific value of the layers. The 
calorific value is an important quality characteristic of lignite since there is a 
strong relation between the calorific value and the mineable reserves. The 
calorific value of lignite layers often is not measured for all drill-hole samples 
taken and should thus be estimated from other measured parameters. In that 
case, the following geochemistry-based equation (4) can be applied:

Where:  
LCV  (kcal/kg) is the lower calorific value of the lignite layer, 
Cwaf (kcal/kg) is the calorific value of the ash-free and water-free combustible

adjusted for the CO2 content, Ca  is the decomposition energy of the calcium 
carbonate (CaCO3), l is the content of the ash in CaCO3 and Cw is the energy of 
vaporization of the water contained in the lignite. The value of Cwaf can be

the lignite, ash  is the ash water free content and  CO2 is the carbon dioxide 
content, while α1,..., α4 are the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model 
which must be determined. 
(5) The thickness of dilution with waste (surface dilution) and the thickness of 
mining lignite loss at the top and bottom of each block. These parameters 
have a significant effect not only in the thickness of the lignite blocks (eq. 1) 
but also they affect the average quality characteristics of the block (eq. 2), in a 
way that they may not satisfy the corresponding cut off quality limits. A 
reduction of the surface dilutions will be a reason for a corresponding higher 
increment of the mining losses. The determination of these parameters (that in 
many cases should be different at the top and at the bottom of the block) in 
relation to cutting geometry of the excavators and to structural geometry of 
the deposit is a very important problem of lignite reserves estimation 
procedure. 
(6) The densities of lignite layers (ρ(l)i ), of waste layers (ρ(w)j) included in the 
blocks, and of waste layer at the top (ρs(t)), and bottom (ρs(b)) of the lignite 
blocks. These parameters affect the reserves estimation results in two ways:  
- 
The calculated reserves (tonnage) of the lignite deposit from the 
corresponding volumes depend on the density of the lignite (tonnage factor).  
- 
The average quality characteristics of the blocks (eq. 2) depend on these 
parameters (weighting factor). They may also affect the exploitability of the 
blocks in a way that they may not satisfy the corresponding cut off quality 
limits. 
The above mentioned densities may vary within wide limits for lignite and waste 
according to their lithology, porosity, petrographic composition, quality or 
other mineralogy characteristics. Therefore, the spatial determination of the 
material densities is critical for the accuracy of lignite reserves estimation. 
(7) The cut off limits of the quality of the run of mine lignite. The main quality 
parameters of the lignite are the ash content and the calorific value. The cut 
off limits of their parameters affect significantly the quantity and the quality 
of lignite reserves, since they are the main criteria besides block thickness for 
the exploitability of a block. The determination of that limits is a very 
important and critical subject of lignite reserves estimation procedure. In the 
process of the validation of the deposit model that is derived from the 
compositional data, the estimation data should be compared to available 
actual production data (Fig. 2).  Furthermore, other quality parameters should 
also be taken into account, e.g. sulphur, nitrogen or other elements.   

186
C.P. Roumpos et al. 
 
From the above mentioned parameters it is obvious that the determination of 
the criteria of the compositing layers into exploitable blocks is an iterative 
algorithmic process that should be revised very often according to local mining 
conditions.  
After the determination of the exploitable lignite blocks the compositional data 
interpolation follows, by applying appropriate interpolation method and by 
integrating the geological structure information of the lignite deposit. Based on 
that interpolation process, the spatial model of the lignite deposit is developed. 
The modelling process should focus on drillhole database structuring, fault 
modelling as well as on stratigraphic correlation (Kapageridis and Kolovos, 2009). 
The validation of the model could be based on the available actual data of the 
deposit.  
2.3 
Estimation of Mineable Lignite Reserves 
The estimation of the mineable lignite reserves should be based on the spatial 
model of the lignite deposit and also on the defined pit limits. For the 
determination of that limits, mining economics parameters should be considered 
and mainly the marginal mining ratio, as well as information of geotechnical 
analysis that will affect the pit slopes inclination.      
The reserves estimation methods include conventional (mainly the inverse 
distance weighting) or geostatistical methods. A simulation-based approach may 
also be applied offering many advantages (Peattie and Dimitrakopoulos, 2013).  
Uncertainty analysis and determination of critical parameters may lead to 
changes of the criteria of compositing of layers into exploitable blocks or to 
suggestions for further exploration.  The new data should be integrated into the 
model and interpolations should be reviewed periodically, incorporating the new 
information. 
From the above described procedure, it can be deducted that the results of the 
estimations of minable lignite reserves of multiple-layered deposits may vary 
within wide limits, depending mainly on the following factors:  
• the algorithm for the determination of lignite and waste blocks in each drill-
hole 
• the parameters (criteria) for compositing layers into exploitable lignite blocks 
in relation to the type of excavators, to the specifications of power plant or to 
other constraints.  
• the accuracy of the quality parameters and density of lignite and waste layers 
included in lignite blocks 
Emphasis should be placed on the suitable integration of geological and local 
deposit characteristics information into the lignite deposit spatial model as well as 
on the lignite reserves estimation method. Benndorf (2013) investigates in situ 
variability and homogenization of key quality parameters in continuous mining 
operations and demonstrates the benefits of integrating conditionally simulated

deposit models and mine planning and scheduling issues to optimize the mining 
operation, adjusting that to the production requirements.

Case Study 
An application of the described process for the estimation of mineable lignite 
reserves, concerning the mid term development of Kardia continuous surface 
lignite mine is presented in this section.  
3.1 
Mine Location – Description of the Kardia Lignite Deposit  
The Kardia mining field is located in the central part of the western boundary of 
Ptolemais mining area (Figure 4). The area of the mine covers approx. 20 km2.  
 
 
Fig. 4 Ptolemais lignite basin and Kardia mine 

188
C.P. Roumpos et al. 
 
Faults striking from WNW-ESE to NW-SE dissect the mining field into several 
fault blocks. The western rim of the mining field is located near the mountain 
front. The thickness of the lignite-bearing layers, including intercalations, mainly 
ranges between 80 and 140 m. In a narrow part of the south-western boundary of 
the mining field, the lignite-bearing layers increase to a thickness of more than 
210 m. In the central and north-western parts of the mining field the thickness of 
the individual split seams, which are partly replaced by intercalations, varies 
within wide limits. The overlying strata thicknesses vary between approx. 20 and 
60 m. In the above mentioned south-western boundary zone, they amount to 
approx. 150 m. (Rheinbraun Engineering and Public Power Corporation of 
Greece, 1996).  
The remaining exploitable lignite reserves amount to 300 Mt. The main mine 
equipment consists of 7 bucket wheel excavators and 4 spreaders, and the annual 
lignite production of the mine is approximately 10-12 Mt. Figure 5 shows the 
mining area, the final mine limits and the areas of continuous and non continuous 
operation of the excavators.

3.2 
Lignite Deposit Modelling and Evaluation of a Mid-term 
Planning Sector 
For the modelling and evaluation of the whole lignite deposit, the process 
described in section 2 was applied. The geological modelling was based on the 
drill-holes data and the available geological information. The case study is 
concentrated on a mid-term development of the mine, where for the lignite 
production only bucket wheel excavators were used, covering a period of two 
years. Figure 6 shows the area of case study, which in the first years of mine 
exploitation in the Ptolemais mines was used as an outside dumping area of waste 
material, the locations of drill-holes, as well as the main faults. In that area, major 
deviations between predicted an actual data were derived by applying the criteria 
of compositing layers into exploitable blocks that used for the previous mining 
sectors. A characteristic phase mapping view is shown in the picture of Fig. 1, 
which also includes the data of a drill-hole (201/205). The location of the drill-
hole is also shown in Fig. 6.  
For the geological correlation of the lignite seams, a face mapping program has 
been applied, in accordance with the available drill-holes data. In addition, new 
drill-holes in that area added new information for the continuity of mineralization 
and lignite spatial variability (Barmpas, 2013).  The results of correlation process 
and the geological modelling are shown in the characteristic cross-section A-A’ 
(Fig. 7). The location of this cross section is also shown in Fig. 6.  
By applying the above described process for modelling of the lignite deposit, 
the effect of the critical parameters that were described in section 2.2 was 
investigated. From the analysis results it was concluded that the most critical 
parameter for the compositing layers into exploitable lignite blocks was the cut-off 
limit in relation to the missing data of calorific value from the most of lignite 
layers in that area. The main reason for this result is the high content of the 
calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the layers included in the compositing lignite 
blocks. This content affects significantly the calorific value of the layers. Figure 8 
shows the comparative average lower calorific value- lignite reserves curve for the 
mined out area (case study area) as a function of ash water free cut off limit. The 
actual production data corresponds to the value of cut off limit (ash water free) 
26%. The values of the calorific value were estimated by applying eq. 4. 
Figure 9 shows the Deviation from actual data of main quantity and quality 
parameters for the case study area as a function of the ash water free cut off limit. 
Major deviations concern the tonnage of lignite reserves, which affect the mining 
ratio.  From Fig. 8 and 9 it is concluded that the effect of the ash water free cut off 
limit is critical.

Conclusions 
The accurate spatial model of a lignite deposit as  well as the mineable reserves 
estimation process have a significant impact on the successful mine planning and 
design phase of the corresponding mining project. In multiple-layered lignite 
deposits this process is more complicated because of the increased requirements 
for selective mining. 
In this paper the iterative process of mineable lignite reserves estimation in 
continuous surface mining is defined. The discrete steps, from data input into the 
database to the application of the appropriate method of reserves estimation are 
described. The lignite modelling and evaluation stages are discussed in greater 
detail.   
From the analysis, it is concluded that the results of the estimations of minable 
lignite reserves of multiple-layered deposits may vary within wide limits. Critical 
factors include the determination of the parameters (criteria of evaluation) for 
compositing layers into exploitable lignite blocks, in relation to the type of 
excavators, to the specifications of power plant or to other constraints as well as 
the accuracy of the quality parameters and density of lignite and waste layers 
included in lignite blocks.  
Because of the high in situ spatial variability of the lignite deposits, for an 
accurate estimation of the minable reserves the geological and local deposit 
characteristics information should be integrated into the lignite deposit spatial 
model. In addition, emphasis should be placed on the appropriate lignite reserves 
estimation method.  
The integration of the spatial model of the lignite deposit and mine planning 
and scheduling optimization techniques could lead to the adjustments in mine 
design and scheduling of key equipment to the production requirements.

Abstract. This paper proposes a procedure for applying Particle swam algorithm 
(PSO) to long term production scheduling problem of the open pit mines, which is 
a large combinatorial optimization problem involving large datasets and multiple 
hard and soft constraint. Constraint programming technique have been used to 
produce the initial population of solutions (particles) and then the continuous 
version of the PSO algorithm have been implied to search the feasible solution 
space for finding better solutions. The performance of different variants such as 
global, local and Multistart of the PSO algorithm have been studied and the results 
are presented.

Introduction 
Mine design and production scheduling of open pit mines is a large scale complex 
optimization problem, which commonly aims to determine the extraction sequence 
of the mineralized material from the ground that produces maximum possible 
discounted profit from the operation while satisfying a set of physical and 
operational constraints such as precedence or slope constraints, processing 
capacity constraints, mining capacity constraints etc. Block model representation 
of the ore body is commonly used for the planning and production scheduling of 
the open pit mines. The block model discretize the ore body and the surrounded 
rock into a three dimensional array of regular size blocks. Each block has set of 
attributes attached to it such as: grade or metal content, tonnage, density etc. 
estimated using drill holes data.  Using a fixed cutoff grade strategy the blocks are 
divided into two groups i.e. ore or waste blocks. If the prospective profit from a 
block exceeds its processing cost it is categorized as an ore block to be sent for 
processing once mined while the rest are the waste blocks. Depending on the 
location of the waste blocks they are either left in the ground or mined and sent to 
the waste dump to get access to the underlying high value ore blocks. An 
economic value is assigned to each block by taking into account its group i.e. its 
ore or waste block, the commodity price, mining, processing and marketing cost. 
The final contour of the pit is determined by solving the ultimate pit limit (UPL) 
problem. The UPL can be defined as the extent to which it is economically

feasible to mine.  Graph based Lerchs and Grossmann algorithm[1] or Max- flow 
algorithms [2] are commonly used for this purpose. Depending on the size of the 
individual blocks and of the ore deposit the UPL may contain thousands to 
millions of blocks that may have to be scheduled over a time horizon typically 
ranging from 5 to 30 years while considering different physical and operational 
constraints which makes it a large combinatorial optimization problem.  
Several modelling and solution techniques have been proposed since 1960to 
solve this problem. Some of these techniques includes parametric or ultimate pit 
limit (UPL) based approaches [3-5], integer programming[6, 7], dynamic 
programming [8, 9], blocks aggregation / clustering[10]etc.. The main limitation 
of these techniques is their high computational cost when applied to real sized 
problem. In the recent years a new class of computationally less expensive 
algorithms i.e. metaheuristic techniques have attracted the attention of several 
researchers to solve the  mine design and production scheduling problem such as 
Genetic Algorithms[11-13], Simulated Annealing [14, 15] , Ant Colony 
optimization [16, 17] etc..  Though metaheuristic techniques do not guarantee the 
optimality of the final solution that they produce but their low computational cost 
makes them attractive alternative choice over the computationally expensive exact 
optimization algorithms. In this paper a relatively new Metaheuristics technique 
known as Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been applied to the open pit 
production scheduling problem. Ferland et al. [18]   has proposed a procedure to 
apply particle swarm optimization to the capacitated open pit mining problem 
considering only one production capacity constraint during each period of the 
mine life. They used a genotype representation of the solutions based on the 
priority value encoding and proposed a decoding scheme to generate feasible 
phenotype solutions from the genotype solutions. A GRASP procedure was 
suggested to produce the initial population of genotype solutions that evolve 
through the solution space using global version of particle swarm algorithm. 
Different properties of the procedure were studied by its application to a group of 
two dimensional problems. This paper proposes a totally different procedure to 
apply particle swarm optimization to more general open pit production scheduling 
problem. It proposes to use constraint programming to generate the initial 
population of particles whose positions will be updated using the continuous 
version of particle swam algorithm.   
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the general 
integer programming formulation of the ultimate pit limit and production 
scheduling problem of the open pit mines are presented. In section 3 the standard 
PSO algorithm is discussed.  In section 4 the proposed procedure for applying 
PSO algorithm to open pit production scheduling problem is presented in detail. 
Results are discussed in section 5 followed by conclusion in section 6.

Problem Formulation 
The planning process of the open pit mine usually starts with definition of ultimate 
pit limit. The mathematical formulation of which can be defined as:

Where ܸ௜ represents the economic value of block ݅, N represents the total 
number of blocks in the block model, ݔ௜ represents a binary variable 
corresponding to block ݅ and ܲ௜ represents the predecessor group of block݅. The 
solution to this problem just returns the collection of blocks that will result into 
maximum possible undiscounted profit, but it does not define the sequence of 
extraction of the blocks in each period while considering different processing, 
production capacity constraints and the discount rate, which is a more complex 
problem to solve. The general integer programming formulation of the open pit 
sequencing problem with the objective to maximize the net present value of the 
operation while satisfying a set of physical and operational constraints similar to 
the one defined by Gaupp in [19] can be described as follows:

which can be extremely difficult and expensive to solve.

Particle Swam Optimization 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population based optimization 
technique first presented by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995[20, 21]. PSO is a 
nature inspired algorithm, based on the social interaction of individuals living 
together in groups e.g. bird flock, fish schools, animal herds etc. PSO algorithm 
performs the search process by using a population (Swarm) of individuals 
(Particles). Each individual (Particle) is a potential solution to the optimization 
problem. A random starting position and random velocity is assigned to each 
particle of the swarm. The velocity represents the speed of “flying” of the particle 
through the solution space. Each individual particle ݅ possesses the following three 
pieces of information:  
ݔԦ௜,௧: Position of the particle ݅ during iteration ݐ,ݔԦ௜,௧ can be considered as a set of 
coordinates specifying the position of a point in the solution space. 
ݒԦ௜,௧:  Velocity of the particle ݅ during iteration ݐ, specifying the step size along 
every coordinate of the solution space. 
݌Ԧ௜,௧:  The personal best position experienced by particle ݅ until iterationݐ .  
The 
corresponding 
personnel

is 
stored 
in 
a 
variable 
calledܾܲ݁ݏݐ௜   (ࡼࢋ࢙࢘࢕࢔ࢇ࢒ ࢈ࢋ࢙࢚)which simplify the comparisons in the later 
iterations. This position is replaced if a better solution is found out by particle ݅ in 
the later iterations. 
The position of the best particle in the neighborhood of particle ݅  until iteration 
ݐ is stored in a variable called ݃
ሬሬሬԦ௧ ݋ݎ  ݈ሬԦ௧(depending on the topology being used)  
the

the later iterations. The position and the velocity of the particles is updated by 
using equation 3.1 and equation3.2 respectively.

update equation also known as Constriction type1" can be defined as:

Applying Particle Swarm Algorithm to Open Pit Mine 
Production Scheduling Problem 
In this study the continuous version of particle swarm algorithm as described in 
section3 (with a few modifications) will be applied to open pit mine production 
scheduling problem. The reason for using the continuous version of particle 
swarm algorithm is twofold: First the block model may contain thousands to 
millions of regular sized blocks; making the scheduling decision on the blocks 
level may be computationally expensive. Secondly the special structure of the 
block model, precedence relationship between the blocks in the same column and 
the one dimensional nature of the PSO algorithm [24] dictates that the scheduling 
problem can be turned into depth determination problem for different periods, 
which makes the PSO calculations faster and the implementation simple. In the 
following sections a few requirements for applying the PSO algorithm to open pit 
production scheduling problem will be discussed in more details. 
4.1.1 
Initial Solutions 
To generate an initial population of random feasible solutions, the open pit 
production scheduling problem was turned into a constraint satisfaction problem 
which was then solved using the CP optimizer of the IBM ILOG CPLEX 
Optimization Studio V12.5 to get multiple feasible solutions. A Constraint 
satisfaction problem needs the following three pieces of information to define a 
problem:  
 
 

202 
A. Khan and C. Niemann-Delius
 
• 
A set of decision variables  
• 
A finite set of possible values for each variable  
• 
Constraint defining the inter variable relationship  
The solution to this problem is to determine the value of every variable from its 
domain such that all the constraints are satisfied. This is achieved by using 
different search algorithms such as arc and path consistency, simple backtracking 
and forward checking and different heuristics to guide the search [25].   
4.1.2 
Solution Encoding 
In order to apply the continuous version of particle swarm algorithm to open pit 
production scheduling problem an encoding scheme is being used. The proposed 
encoding scheme determines the deepest block along a certain column to be mined 
in a certain period. This value (depth) is stored into a variable corresponding to 
that column and period.  These depths are them updated using standard PSO 
algorithm in each iteration 
4.1.3 
Back Transform 
After each iteration a back transform scheme is used to determine the period in 
which a block is scheduled. The procedure takes the depth variable for a certain 
column and period and determines all the blocks that are lying above that depth 
and below the depth defined by the PSO algorithm for the same column for the 
prior period. There is no upper limit for the first period. This process progresses 
from the first to the last period. During the optimization process it is insured that 
depth for the successive periods along a column does not cross each other.  
4.1.4 Constraint Handling 
Particle swarm algorithm like other evolutionary algorithms does not have an 
explicit mechanism for constraint handling. Considering the special structure of 
the constraints the following two techniques have been used for constraint 
handling in this study: 
• 
Due to the one dimensional nature of the PSO algorithm, the mining depths 
along each column for each period are determined independently from each 
other which may result in infeasible solution in terms of the required slope 
angles. A normalization technique (a constraint repair technique)is being 
applied to each back transformed infeasible solution after each iteration to 
turn it into a feasible solution in terms of the required slope angles as shown 
in Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2.(SGeMS software have been used for 
visualization[26]). 
 

Application of Particle Swarm Optimization 
203
 
• 
A constant penalty method[27] is used to deal with the Mining and Processing 
capacity constraints, where a constant penalty is added to the objective 
function for per ton violation of  the capacity constraints, to decrease the 
quality of the infeasible solutions .The value of the penalty is problem 
dependent.

Population Topology 
The learning process of the individual particles of the Particle swarm algorithm is 
based on the social interaction among the particles within the same neighborhood. 
Considering the neighborhood structure / Population Topology the following two 
different versions of the PSO have been proposed in the literature [20, 28]:

• 
gbest: In the gbest neighborhood every particle is influenced by the best 
solution found by any member of the entire population. In this topological 
structure every particle compares its performance with every other member of 
the entire population and follows the best one. 
• 
lbest:In the lbest topology a particle is influenced by the best solution found 
by its k immediate neighbors. The index based neighbourhood will be used in 
this study.  
Particle swarm algorithm using the gbest neighborhood converges much faster 
than the one using the lbest neighborhood, with much higher likelihood to get 
trapped into a local optimum position[22]. A detailed description of different 
Population Topologies and their influence on PSO algorithm’s performance can be 
found in [29].

Numerical Results 
To check the capabilities of the proposed procedure for applying PSO algorithm to 
long term production scheduling problem of the open pit mines, a computer 
programme has been developed in Microsoft Visual studio 2010 (C++) 
programming environment. A hypothetical 3D block model has been used for 
performance analysis of the proposed algorithm. The ultimate pit limit was 
determined by solving the ultimate pit limit problem as defined in section 2.The 
required slope angles were supposed to be 450 in all directions. The general 
information about the blocks within the predefined UPL and optimization 
parameters are given in Table 1.

The length of each scheduling period was supposed to be 1 year. The upper and 
lower limits for Processing and Mining Capacity were set to be within ± 10% and 
± 15% of the average available quantity of ore and rock within the UPL for each 
period respectively. All the numerical experiments have been completed on AMD 
Phenom IIX 4 945 (3 GHz )  and 4 GB Ram running under windows 7. An exact 
solution of the problem was determined using CPLEX, which will be used as a 
benchmark to assess the performance of the PSO algorithm in terms of 
computational time and solution quality. The details about of the solution found 
by CPLEX are given in Table 2. 
A series of experiments were carried out to find out the optimal values for 
certain parameters such as Population size and maximum number of iteration for 
the algorithm to converge for the problem under consideration. These values will 
remain constant in the subsequent experimentation.

Population size: In comparison to other evolutionary algorithms e.g. Genetic 
Algorithms, PSO needs smaller population [30]. After conducting a series of 
experiments a population size containing 50 particles was found out to be 
performing well for the problem under consideration. A population of 50 
feasible solutions (particles) was generated using constraint programming 
technique; these particles will be used throughout this study. The quality of 
the initial population was found out to have significant effects on the 
performance of PSO algorithm.  The objective function values (NPV) of the 
generated particles are given in Figure 5.1 
• 
Maximum Iterations: The global variant of the PSO algorithm generally 
needs less time / iterations to converge than the local variant of the algorithm. 
To get an upper bound on the number of iteration required by both the 
variants before convergence, a series of preliminary tests were carried out, 
where it was found out that the maximum numbers of iterations required by 
the global and local variants of the PSO algorithm to converge are 
approximately 2200 and 5000 iterations respectively for the problem under 
consideration. A general idea about the convergence behavior of local variant 
with different neighbourhood sizes vs. the global variant can be observed in 
the Figure 5.2, it shows that the local variant of the PSO algorithm shows a 
relatively slower rate of convergence and needs relatively more time to 
converge than the global variant. The convergence behaviour of the global

As described before local version of PSO algorithm with different 
neighbourhood sizes were allowed to run for a fixed number of iteration i.e. 5000 
in the current case. The CPU time column shows that the average computation 
time generally increase with increasing neighbourhood size except in the case 
when K = 2, whose performance both in the terms of solution quality and 
computation time is not satisfactory with relatively higher % Gap and 
computational time. By considering the quick convergence behaviour of the global

of the PSO algorithm in relatively less time. Multistart strategy almost always 
performed better than the local and global variants showing its ability to escape 
the local optima. The standard deviation of % Gap in almost all the cases has very 
small values showing the robustness of the procedure. The proposed procedure in 
all the cases can produce better quality results in relatively shorter period of time 
in comparison to the exact optimization algorithms implied by CPLEX.

Conclusion 
In this paper, a procedure has been proposed to apply a metaheuristic technique 
based on Particle Swam Algorithm to long term open pit scheduling problem. 
Constraint programming technique has been used to produce the initial population 
of feasible solution (particles). This population was kept constant to study the 
effects of different algorithmic settings on the performance of the procedure i.e. 
global, local and Multistart variants of the PSO algorithm. By making comparison 
with the results obtained using CPLEX in terms of computational time and 
solution quality it was learned that the proposed procedure can produce better 
quality solutions in relatively shorter period of time with smaller % Gap and 
standard deviation showing the robustness of the procedure. The proposed 
procedure is quit flexible and can easily accommodate additional constraints, 
variable slopes angles and grade and market uncertainties.

Abstract. ARENA simulation software as one of the most comprehensive tools of 
discrete event simulation modeling has been used in this research for evaluation of 
the transportation system of the Sungun copper mine. Its user friendly 
environment makes it easy for the users to construct a representative model of 
complex systems and freely make diversity of modifications to monitor the 
upcoming results. Using simulation modeling, different management systems of 
the open pit mining equipment including fixed and flexible assignments of trucks 
for loaders have been studied. Developed model in ARENA has the capability of 
considering detailed features of both loading and hauling equipment. Productivity 
assessment scenarios have been established on the constructed model for the 
current fixed assignment managing procedure. Furthermore, a dispatching 
simulation model with the objective function of minimizing truck waiting times 
have been developed and a 7.8% improvement obtained by applying a flexible 
assignment of the trucks for the loaders compared to the fixed assignment system. 
Keywords: ARENA, Simulation modeling, truck assignment, dispatching, open 
pit mining.

Introduction 
Truck and loader systems are widely used in open pit mines due to their flexibility 
and productivity features in comparison with the other haulage systems. Although 
these systems require the least infrastructure to be settled in mining operations [1], 
but still haulage costs in earthmoving projects constitutes the main portion of total 
expenditures [2]. Lizotte et al. believe that material handling represents more than 
50% of whole operating costs and some others estimate this amount to reach 60% 

214 
A.S. Hashemi and J. Sattarvand
 
 
in some cases [3]. Hence the mining operation is a highly expensive industry; even 
a small reduction in these costs would be noteworthy for both managers and mine 
planners. In other words, reducing haulage costs just for a few percent would 
cause remarkable savings in both operating and capital costs. 
As the need for raw material by the industry increases, open pit mines go 
deeper and low grade deposits look economic for exploitation [4]. Though trying 
to design bigger equipment was considered as the first step to respond to this 
query, that’s why today we encounter some gigantic trucks with about 350 tons 
capacity and some big shovels to serve these dump trucks. But it seems that the 
trend for capacity increase cannot keep up with the high demand for productivity, 
so the next step in coping with this highly increasing demand is to try to find the 
best solution for the management of the operating fleet in the mine. 
Transition of fleet management paradigm from fixed to flexible assignment of 
trucks for loaders has been discussed for more than 35 years. Application of first 
dispatching system in a limestone quarry mine in Germany showed a great 
improvement in equipment efficiency [5] and since then different dispatching 
packages with diversity of optimization criteria have been introduced to mining 
industry. 
In 1988 Eduardo Bonates and Yves Lizotte worked on evaluation of applying a 
dispatching system by use of a computer simulation model. In this model, they 
categorized fleet management systems in 3 main groups including: Manual 
Dispatching, Semi-Automated Dispatching and Automated Dispatching [5]. The 
resulted model which was written in FORTRAN, attempts to take into account the 
real features of the mine and optimize the utilization of the trucks and shovels as 
an LP objective function [5]. Z. Li introduced a methodology for optimum control 
of shovel and truck operation in 1989 [6]. The mentioned methodology was 
developed by applying 3 indicating questions and trying to find the best answer to 
each: 
- 
How much load in each route should be handled inside the pit and which 
route network is the optimum? 
- 
How are the trucks assigned to the shovels? 
- 
What is the best number of trucks to achieve the excavation target? 
Later F. Soumis et al. developed a procedure for solving the dispatching 
problem [7]. Their research was based on a nonlinear objective function with 3 
parameters including: deviation of shovel’s operational excavation from its 
objective excavation, deviation of trucks’ real working hours from their scheduled 
operating hours, the third factor consists of some penalties assigned for deviation 
from desired ore blending [7]. In 1993 B. Forsman et al. designed a computer 
simulation model for Aitik open pit mine [8]. Using a discrete event modeling 
microcomputer called METAFORA, they could build a graphical model of the 
mine. Simulation results dictated the optimum haulage network and number of 
trucks in order to reach desired excavation target [8]. D. Gove and W. Morgan

worked on truck-loader matching and the influential parameters using CAT’s fleet 
production and cost (FPC) software [9]. B. Kolonja and J.M. Mutmansky 
developed a simulation model for analyzing dispatching strategies using SIMAN 
[10]. A dispatching strategy is the way a dispatching system encounters with 
optimization problem [10]. Heuristic strategies try to find local optimums while in 
combined strategies an LP model takes the production objectives into account and 
then a heuristic procedure assigns the truck to the shovels [10]. M. Ataeepour and 
E. Y. Baafi worked on a simulation model for truck-shovel operation using Arena 
[11]. The first step is to monitor the effect of number of trucks in system 
utilization and then applying a dispatching rule with objective function of 
minimizing trucks waiting times. In other attempt in 1999 A. J. Basu proposed a 
simulation model for Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines (KCGM) using 
GPSS/H. Applied strategy in this model is to assign a truck to a shovel with least 
queue length [12]. 
S. Alarie and M. Gamache conducted a research on solution strategies used in 
truck dispatching systems for open pit mines [3]. Based on their research, 
dispatching problem can be solved using two major approaches: a single stage 
approach tries to dispatch the trucks without applying any excavation constraint or 
blending while in a multistage approach an excavation target using LP or heuristic 
methods is set to the operation as the upper stage. In the lower stages the 
assignments are handled in a way that the deviation of operational excavation 
from the targets that are suggested by upper stage to be minimum. Qiang Wang et 
al. studied truck real-time dispatching from a macroscopic perspective [13]. By 
evaluating the flow rates of the trucks and introducing some base nodes, the 
proposed model showed better results in comparison with the conventional 
dynamic programming methods. 
In 2007 C. N. Burt and L. Caccetta proposed some approaches for the 
calculation of a match factor for heterogeneous truck and loader fleets [14, 15]. 
Based on their methods, a match factor of a fleet consisting different types of 
trucks and shovels is attainable considering their cycle times. The proposed 
method is also capable of considering different haul road features. 
A. Jaoua et al in 2009 developed a framework for realistic microscopic 
modeling of surface mining transportation systems [16]. They believed the 
conventional macroscopic models lacked considering microscopic features of the 
system under study. Therefore a simulator called SuMiTSim is developed by A. 
Jaoua et al using SIMAN. An important indicator in this simulator is the 
occupancy level of the road segments [16]. Real time study of the mine traffic 
using the strategy of optimizing the occupancy level of road segments makes it 
easy to deal with unwanted traffic congestions and strengthens the flexibility of 
the system. Comparisons of SuMiTSim with other macroscopic simulators 
concluded that the microscopic approach has the ability of considering detailed 
features of mining operation like interaction between equipment and operators. 
Thus, the dispatching model based on microscopic approach has higher reliability 
level in contrast with other macroscopic models [16]. E. K. Chanda and S. 
Gardiner compared different methods for prediction of truck cycle times [17]. The 

216

results proved that by using multiple linear regression method and artificial neural 
networks (NN), one can estimate the truck cycle time with the least deviation from 
reality while using simulation software like TALPAC leads to more deviated 
outputs.

Sungun Mine Features and Model Construction  
Sungun copper deposit is the second largest copper mine in Iran. It is located in a 
mountainous area between Sungun and Pakhir rivers in Eastern Azerbaijan 
province of Iran, by the border of Azerbaijan and Armenia and 130 km from 
Tabriz, the capital of the province. The geological reserve of the deposit is 
estimated at 828 million tons with an average copper grade of 0.62 percent. 
Mining operations are handled using rigid frame rear dump trucks and hydraulic 
shovels, backhoes or front end loaders. Annual excavation target for the mine is 
30M tons of ore and waste. The fleet is managed in a non-dispatching mode. 
Operating fleet consists of Komatsu HD 785 and HD 325 dump trucks, Liebherr 
R9350 Hydraulic shovel, Komatsu PC 800 hydraulic backhoes, Komatsu WA 600 
and CAT 988 front end loaders. There are 3 main dumping destinations for trucks: 
crusher, low grade stockpile and waste dump. Each working day consists of 3 shift 
rosters. The mine operates 24 hours a day and 363 days per year.  
The required data for analyzing the haulage system utilization is the record time 
periods for trucks’ and loaders’ cycle, queue time at loading point and loaders’ 
idle time. These time sets are then used as input data for the simulation software. 
For recording cycle times, a recording procedure was designed for each of the 
operating faces. A chronograph instrument at each face recorded the time data. For 
recording of the each truck’s cycle time, a reference time point was assigned for it 
which was the moment that the loader pours its first bucket load into the truck 
tray. This moment was recorded in the report paper in front of the truck’s ID 
which was unique for each truck. When after a period of time the same truck 
appears in loading point, again the mentioned reference point was recorded to the 
truck, therefore, each truck cycle time would be attainable via deducting two 
following reference points. Similarly another reference point was assigned for 
recording of the loading times which was the moment that the empty truck at the 
loading point started to maneuver for positioning till it starts leaving the loading 
station. In this case the latter would be considered as loading with exchange time 
instead of just loading time. Truck waiting time was considered the time period 
from getting a truck to the loading point till starting to maneuver for loading. 
Gathered raw data were then inserted into a spreadsheet to conduct some statistical 
analysis. At first point some data were considered as outlier and omitted from 
following calculations [8]; the logic applied was considering a significance level 
of α=0.05 so that accepted data are as followed: 
ܺത−1.96ܵ൏ݔ൏ܺത+ 1.96ܵ

Where S is the standard deviation and ܺത is the average of the sample data; then 
x would be accepted region for data. Once all data sets were approved through this 
procedure, each set was statistically analyzed to fit a distribution function. Using 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi Square tests, the best function with the least square 
error from the empirical data was selected.

As it was screened inside the mine, there were 5 major loading faces, which 
were considered as 5 loading stations. Table 1 shows destinations for each station, 
distances from loading to dumping points, and specifications of fleet in each 
subsystem. (Contents in loading station column refer to elevation of the 
corresponding operating bench inside the pit). Table 2 shows the best fitted 
models for each data set. All times are in minutes in this table. 
Once the required input data were prepared for all operating faces, a simulation 
model should be constructed to represent real characteristics of loading and 
hauling operations. To this end, Arena simulation software which is one of the 
most powerful discrete event simulation tools was applied for building a model of 
haulage system.  
Since two of the five operating subsystem’s destination is crusher, a distinct 
model should be considered for representation of these two subsystems in order to 
realistically take the effect of crushing process into account. Figure 1 shows the 
layout of the constructed model.

To have an acceptable reliability of the model and to ensure that the model 
truly represents the real system, there should be an indicating factor for comparing 
model outputs with the real system [9]. The most important output of the model is 
trucks cycle time, because it involves all time variables in it; therefore it was 
applied as an indicating factor for validation of the model. As it can be seen from 
Figure 2, constructed model represents the characteristics of the system under 
study with a high level of confidence.

Modelling of Dispatching System 
Once the system evaluated by match factor index, it seems all independent sub 
fleets should operate in a way that there should not be any waiting time for loaders 
and no queue of trucks at the loading faces, but due to the inherent variability in 
mining operations, in some cases queue lines of trucks or idle loaders have been 
observed. This variability which can occur because of unwanted traffic congestion 
or a special loading condition, leads to disarrangement of the fleet. Therefore, 
applying a flexible managing system for trucks which monitors the dynamic 
condition of in pit operation seems inevitable. Such a system dispatches every 
truck to a loader in a way that an optimization criteria be satisfied and leads to a 
condition that waiting times are set to minimum. 
Unique geologic condition of Sungun copper mine forces the mine managers to 
apply front end loaders rather than shovels due to their high operational flexibility. 
Considering this condition and also by comparing operational costs of loaders 
with trucks, it is decided to set the dispatching objective function on minimizing 
truck wait times and applying of the strategy of dispatching one truck to n shovels. 
Dispatching model was applied for the 5 working benches of the study, though 
for loading and hauling times, the data used from fixed assignment model and 
applied to have proper situation for future comparison of these two managing 
systems. It was approved that using dispatching systems in a condition that the 
system is over-trucked or under-trucked makes no efficient improvement in 
system utilization, though the important factor while setting the input data is the 
number of trucks. Therefore it is crucial to have the correct number of trucks 
while using dispatching system. Consequently the number of trucks in dispatching 
model was set to those applied in the modified fixed assignment model.

Abstract. Continuous surface mining systems, employing bucket wheel excava-
tors, belt conveyors, and stackers, are used in the exploitation of most of the  
large lignite mines in northern Greece. One particular characteristic of these mines 
is that the deposits consist of a series of lignite layers of thickness varying from 
just a few centimeters up to several meters, with interbedded layers of sandy  
and clayey waste material. This multi-layer geology dictates frequent changes of 
the material excavated on each bench, which adds to the complexity of the inhe-
rently stochastic mining system and makes material flow a critical performance 
parameter. 
In this paper an animated discrete-event simulation of such an operating conti-
nuous mining system is presented. An extensive statistical analysis of recorded 
operational data for a period spanning a full calendar year, as well as of the depo-
sit’s spatial variability, provides the empirical distributions used to model input 
variables. The distribution of material flow at the belt conveyor hub, production 
estimates, equipment availability and utilization are model outputs. The simulation 
model is evaluated in terms of its suitability for decision making under risk during 
mine planning and design.

1 Introduction 
The continuous excavation system and the strip mining method are widespread in 
Europe for mining lignite deposits. Such systems consist of bucket wheel excava-

226 
T.N. Michalakopoulos et al.
 
tors (BWE), belt conveyors (BC), and stackers operating in series and forming a 
network of continuous excavated material flow. 
The serial operation makes the production levels that can be achieved very sen-
sitive to both reliability and proper matching of the various equipment units.  
Limited production capacity or frequent overloading and spillage, resulting in ad-
ditional costs for secondary materials handling, characterize inadequately  
designed systems. Respectively, high owning and operating costs in relation to ac-
tual production levels characterize over-designed systems [1]. 
Material flow rate distribution is a critical performance parameter in designing 
and operating such continuous excavation systems. Given the stochastic nature of 
unit breakdowns, loaded material on the intersecting belts and material arrival at 
the transfer points, of particular interest is the amount of spilled material at trans-
fer points and hub bottlenecks. 
Because of this inherent stochastic nature, simulation is well suited for design-
ing such systems. Walkley and Hutson [2], Watford and Greene [3], Yingling and 
Kumar [4], Agioutantis and Stratakis [5], Lebedev and Staples [6], and McNearny 
and Nie [1] have published simulation methods and applications for designing 
continuous excavation systems. Yingling reviews such methods in reference [7]. 
Sturgul et al. present an interesting aspect regarding the simulation of conti-
nuous material flow systems in reference [8]. Modeling continuous material flow 
with discrete-event system simulation is one of the difficult problems in mining 
systems simulation. They suggest a method where the continuous material flow is 
divided into finite excavated material units placed onto the conveyors. 
Discrete-event system simulation is one in which the state of the model, and 
consequently of the system being simulated, changes only at a discrete, but possi-
bly random, set of time points, known as event times [9]. 
In this paper, the exploitation of a multi-layer (zebra-like) lignite deposit with a 
continuous surface excavation system consisting of six BWEs of three different 
types, three stackers, and approximately 40 km of conveyors is simulated. Multi-
layer lignite deposits are very common in Greece and lignite is still the main re-
source for power generation providing 48% of the electric power. These deposits 
consist of a series of lignite layers of thickness varying from just a few centimeters 
up to several meters, separated by interbedded layers of sandy and clayey waste 
materials. Figure 1 depicts a typical multi-layer stratigraphy of the Greek lignite 
deposits. Geology and the fact that lignite layers with ash content more than 30-
40% are considered waste for quality and environmental reasons, make the appli-
cation of selective mining with BWEs the principal method for the exploitation of 
Greek lignite deposits. 
ARENA™, a product of Rockwell Automation, Inc. [11], has been used as the 
simulation software in this paper. Recorded historical data regarding the geology 
of the lignite deposit, the configuration of the mine, the operational state of

equipment and production figures formed the basis for setting up and validating a 
discrete-event system simulation model. The model output is the distribution of 
the material flow rate at the transfer points, production estimates, equipment utili-
zation etc. 
In order to facilitate easy communication of the simulation model and the re-
sults of this investigation, animation of the continuous excavation system opera-
tion is provided as well.

System Configuration 
The simulated mining system is based on the Kardia Field mine as it was during 
2006. This mine is owned and operated by the Public Power Corporation of 
Greece SA (PPC). It is part of the Western Macedonia Lignite Centre, which is a 
mine complex located in northwest Greece. Lignite excavated from the mine feeds 
the 1250 MW Kardia thermal power station. The configuration of the simulated 
mine is shown in figure 2.

T.N. Michalakopoulos et al.
 
The simulated excavation systems are organized in six branches so that each 
mining bench has its own BWE, face conveyor and main conveyor. Each BWE se-
lectively excavates either lignite or waste in terrace cuts and transfers the material 
to the face conveyor, which conveys it along the bench to the main conveyor. All 
material excavated at the six benches finally arrives at one single conveyor hub, 
where waste is distributed to one of the three stackers for dumping, and lignite is 
forwarded either to the power station or to an intermediate lignite bunker. Table 1 
shows the technical specifications of the BWEs on the simulated branches. 
The height of each terrace cut is governed by the thickness of the interbedded 
lignite and waste layers and the need for selective mining. Due to the multi-layer 
nature of the deposit, changes from lignite to waste and vice versa are very fre-
quent, and dilution of lignite with waste or losses of lignite in waste occur. Each 
time a material change takes place, the BWE stops excavating while the face con-
veyor continues conveying its load, so that a void is created on the belt. This void 
facilitates the adjustments at the BC hub, which are required for the proper distri-
bution of the excavated material.

The mine operates 24/7. Regular maintenance is carried out on a weekly, 
monthly, and annual schedule. The annual maintenance has a duration of one 
month and is scheduled in off-peak power demand periods. During annual main-
tenance the production on the given mining bench ceases. Breakdowns of the 
equipment units are random and independent. Due to the “in series” system confi-
guration, equipment units feeding a failing unit are blocked and set out of opera-
tion while the failure is being repaired. 
The system is of a characteristic strong stochastic nature that is based on the 
randomness of significant system parts and operations. The combined effect of 
random equipment breakdowns, frequent material type changes, and cuts of vary-
ing heights,  make the prediction of the exact material flow rate at any given future 
time point a difficult task of great uncertainty. 
The mine is closely monitored and all events are recorded in a digital log. Each 
entry holds information for the affected branch, the event type and description, its 
start and duration. Data from the events logbook have been used for input model-
ing. Production output has been used for model validation and verification. The 
data used cover one calendar year (2006). 
2.2 
Model Assumptions 
The model represents logically and numerically the flow of excavated material 
from the point of excavation by a BWE to its final destination. The smallest quan-
tity of excavated material taken into consideration is the finite bucket load. Each 
excavated bucket load is represented in the model as an individual entity, which 
after creation is routed through the conveyor network on the basis of whether it 
represents lignite or waste. 
At simulation initialization a single production control entity is created for each 
BWE and forwarded to an infinite loop. There it cycles producing bucket loads by 
seizing and releasing a resource representing the bucket wheel. The process is 
shown graphically in figure 3. The excavation rate is controlled by the discharges 
per minute, the bucket volume in m3, a dimensionless bucket fill factor, and the  
 

230 
T.N. Michalakopoulos et al.
 
state of the BWE. Material type (i.e. lignite or waste), volume in m3 for both waste 
and lignite, and weight in t for lignite is saved in attributes of each bucket load 
entity and used for calculating statistics regarding production output and material 
flow rate. 
 
Fig. 3 The finite bucket loads production process. 
In the excavating state the BWEs advance along their bench with a velocity of 
0.7 m/h, thus changing location. Each bench is divided in 40 m long blocks of 
known waste to lignite ratio. These blocks correspond to the geological model of 
the mine. The location of the BWE combined with the geological model defines 
the excavated material’s type and its final destination. The material type is sam-
pled in random time points. If a material change is experienced, the corresponding 
destination of the excavated bucket loads is changed as well, according to the dis-
tribution of the final destinations for the respective branch. 
On a material change the BWE stops to create a void on the belt of the con-
veyor, as mentioned above. Other reasons which stop a BWE are its annual main-
tenance, scheduled maintenance, and random unscheduled failures. Except for  
annual maintenance that takes place according to a calendar schedule, all other 
events follow their own interarrival time and duration distributions. 
In general, equipment stops are random and independent in regard to their inte-
rarrival times. However, there are situations where overlapping reasons may exist 
for a unit to be halted. For example, if during a BWE failure its downstream con-
veyor fails as well, and the BWE repair finishes before the repair of the conveyor,  
 

Discrete-Event Simulation of Continuous Mining Systems  
231
 
the BWE becomes available only after the repair of the conveyor has been com-
pleted. In other words, until the conveyor is available again the BWE is blocked. 
Such situations are an inherent characteristic of the “in series” equipment opera-
tion. 
In order to manage blocking and keep track of the number of causes that set a 
certain equipment unit unavailable, a control storage is defined and used for each 
BWE and conveyor. Each time a unit changes its state, the state of all upstream 
units is updated as well, by using appropriate HOLD modules either waiting for a 
signal or scanning for a specific condition to fulfill, which usually is a certain state 
of the storage. 
The simulation model has been organized using submodels, in a way that pro-
vides a template for its easy adjustment to other continuous mining system confi-
gurations. A view of this submodels structure is shown in figure 4. Additionally, a 
different random number stream is used for each branch, so that in simulation runs 
with alternative configurations no interaction exists between the experimental 
conditions of the branches. 
 
 
Fig. 4 The submodels structure 
2.3 
Input Modeling 
The basis of input modeling has been the digital events logbook of the Kardia 
Field mine for the entire calendar year 2006. A total of 189364 entries have been 
grouped according to the affected branch, equipment unit and event type. 
For the branches ingoing to the BC hub, i.e. the BWE branches E1 through E6, 
the following data have been analyzed: 
• Interarrival times and duration for belt conveyor events (up/down). 
• BWE annual maintenance start and end. 

232 
T.N. Michalakopoulos et al.
 
• Interarrival times and duration of BWE scheduled maintenance events (other 
than annual). 
• Interarrival times and duration of BWE unscheduled failures events. 
• Interarrival times and duration of vacations, strikes, and other special events. 
For all branches these events were found to be negligible and were not taken 
into further consideration. 
• Interarrival times and duration of destination changes, i.e. the event of the 
BWE stopping in order to create a void on the belt conveyor that will facilitate 
the change of destination at the BC hub. Material changes are always asso-
ciated with such events, though it is not necessary to experience a material 
change on every occasion. In the model these events trigger the sampling of 
material type. Their duration has been found to be consistently equal to four 
minutes. 
• The distribution of destinations for waste and lignite. 
• The distribution of excavated material. 
For the branches outgoing from the BC hub, i.e. the stacker branches A1, A2, 
A3, the power station branch K, and the lignite bunker branch KB, the following 
data have been analyzed: 
• Annual maintenance start and end. 
• Interarrival times and duration of scheduled maintenance events (other than an-
nual). 
• Interarrival times and duration of unscheduled failures events. 
In addition, all log entries have been analyzed in terms of the state of each 
equipment unit, so that the output of the simulation runs can be validated and veri-
fied. 
To gain an understanding of the dynamic behavior of the analyzed time va-
riables their values have been plotted in the sequence they were recorded. In gen-
eral, they appear to be random and independent. This has been further assessed by 
scatter diagrams of the pairs (Xi, Xi+1) for i = 1, 2,…, n-1, where no particular cor-
relation was observed. Figure 5 shows those diagrams for the interarrival times 
and duration of the BWE unscheduled repairs of branch E3. 
Summary statistics have been estimated as well, with emphasis on specific per-
centiles. In Table 2 the summary statistics for the interarrival times and duration of 
the BWE unscheduled repairs of branch E3 are given. 
The estimated percentiles formed the basis for modeling input to the model. 
They were used to define piecewise-linear empirical distributions for all time va-
riables. In order to determine how representative the fitted distributions are, they 
were plotted on the same graph with the observed data themselves. In general, a 
very good fit was observed, which can be attributed to the relatively large number 
of percentiles used to define the model. A typical example can be seen in figure 6. 
In total, 62 empirical distributions have been defined for interarrival times and 
durations.

As mentioned above, each mining bench has been divided in 40 m long blocks, 
which correspond to the blocks of the mine’s geological model. For each such 
block the waste to lignite ratio has been used to define a discrete Bernoulli distri-
bution that describes the probability of excavating either waste or lignite. During a 
simulation run the location of the BWEs is monitored and each time a destination 
change event takes place the associated Bernoulli distribution is sampled. 
Regarding the distribution of destinations, for all ingoing branches a discrete 
distribution has been defined for each of the two cases of material excavated (lig-
nite or waste). When a destination change event takes place the appropriate distri-
bution is sampled, and the hub settings are changed accordingly. 
Furthermore, the technical specifications of the BWEs and the BCs are used as 
model input. The most significant BWE characteristics are the bucket capacity in 
m3, and the discharges per minute. The latter is the reciprocal of the duration of 
each bucket discharge and therefore it is used in the model to control the produc-
tion rate of bucket loads. For the BCs, the length in meters and the velocity in m/s 
are used to setup the conveyors network model. 
3 Simulation Runs and Output 
Ten replications of the simulation model have been executed. Each replication 
started with a system warm-up period of one day and simulated a full year of op-
eration. 
The replications were run in five antithetic pairs. Antithetic variates are a va-
riance reduction technique that is applicable in simulations of single systems [9]. 
The paired replications were partially synchronized through the dedication of spe-
cific random number streams to each branch. 
During the simulation runs, data regarding the excavated material and system 
state were recorded. Analysis of these data provided the required production in-
dices. 
The most significant output variables of interest are material flow rate, and lig-
nite and waste volumes excavated and conveyed on each branch. For the purpose

of model validation and verification, emphasis was given on the state of the sys-
tem as well. 
In figure 7 the distribution of simulation time in regard to the state of the E3 
BWE in each replication is shown. The average of all replications for BWE E3 is 
shown in figure 8. The advance of the BWEs on the benches can be seen in figure 
9. The production yielded is given in Table 3, where the simulated average is 
compared to the actual one

In general, the simulated average of the combined lignite and waste volume is 
in very good agreement with the actual one. The differences range from -4.3 % to 
2.5 %. The same applies for the coefficient of variation, with very low values for 
the combined lignite and waste volume. The agreement is not good for the particu-
lar material types excavated on each bench, which calls for a refinement of the 
model in regard to the interaction among the processes for the selection of materi-
al type, the BWE advance, and the selection and implementation of the excavated 
material conveying sequences.

Figure 10 is a time plot for the transfer rate demand, i.e. the rate at which lig-
nite and waste arrive from the excavating branches at the BC hub. The plot high-
lights the dynamic, stochastic characteristics of this demand, which results from 
the combination of the random and independent performance of the individual 
branches.

The continuous recording of the transfer rate demand provides the data for the 
estimation of its distribution over time. In figure 11 a typical histogram of the de-
mand for waste and lignite transfer rate can be seen. Such distributions, in combi-
nation with the respective distributions of the capacity of the downstream lignite 
and waste handling subsystems, can be used to estimate the probability of expe-
riencing bottlenecks at the BC hub or material spillage. This information forms the 
basis to move from decision-making under uncertainty to decision-making under 
risk in the design and dimensioning of continuous mining systems, where a ration-
al balance between owning and operating cost on the one hand, and system capaci-
ty on the other, has to be reached.

In figure 12 a typical screenshot of the system animation is shown. On the left 
hand side the flow of the excavated material through the conveyor network is vi-
sualized. The main information is dynamically displayed in the state and produc-
tion matrix, where data can be found regarding to the current state of all units 
composing the system, the destination setting on the BC hub, the production 
achieved to-date and its distribution to the various destinations, as well as the loca-
tion, direction and velocity of the BWEs. In addition, a time plot is provided to vi-
sualize the transfer rate demand for waste and lignite for the last month, as well as 
histograms of the to-date transfer rate of all outgoing branches.

5 Conclusions 
A discrete-event simulation model of a continuous mining system used to mine a 
multi-layer lignite deposit has been presented in this paper. The model simulated 
the configuration of PPC’s Kardia Field mine. Extensive statistical analysis of his-
torical data was the basis for input modeling and verification of the simulated out-
put. Detailed piecewise-linear empirical distributions were used for all random 
time variables modeling the interarrival time and duration of the events. The geo-
logical model was used to define the excavated waste to lignite ratio at each loca-
tion of the mining benches. Continuous material flow has been modeled by using a 
finite bucket load approach. 
Five antithetic pairs of simulation replications have been executed. Preliminary 
output shows that the simulated average of the combined lignite and waste volume 
is in very good agreement with the actual one. The differences range from -4.3 %

to 2.5 %. Still, a refinement of the model in regard to the interaction among the 
processes for the selection of material type, the BWE advance, and the selection 
and implementation of the excavated material conveying sequences, is needed. 
Animation was used to verify the simulation model and to facilitate easy com-
munication of the underlying assumptions and the results. 
The continuous recording of the transfer rate demand provides the data for the 
estimation of its distribution over time. This information forms the basis to move 
from decision-making under uncertainty to decision-making under risk in the de-
sign and dimensioning of continuous mining systems, where a rational balance  
between owning and operating cost on the one hand, and system capacity on the 
other, has to be reached.

Optimizing of Sampling of Lignite Deposit 
Using Geostatistical Methods – A Case Study

Introduction 
Sampling on each stage (D, C2, C1, B) aims at documenting quality parameters of 
the fossil in a given location (obtaining discrete data) so that it is  possible to 
obtain information with increased reliability on the deposit and the manner of 
arrangement of collected samples may cause significant consequences in the 
aspect of economics (Carrasco at al., 2004). Wrong net of holes is included as a 
geological risk (one of many existing in the chain of values’ creation (Jurdziak, 
Wiktorowicz, 2008a). Therefore, a key issue is optimization of recognition and 
sampling of deposits and, as a consequence, estimating resources of deposits 
intended for exploitation so that the estimated values are encumbered with the 
smallest error possible. Simultaneously, it should be remembered that the costs 
resulting from sampling (recognition) are adequate to the benefits involving a 
possibility to steer the quality of the winning directed to the power station 
(Naworyta, 2008). Geostatic methods are used to solve the abovementioned 
problems (Clark 1987, Clark, Harper, 2001; Journel, Huijbregts, 2003; Mucha, 
1994; Namysłowska-Wilczyńska, 2006). The reasonability for using them in order 
to reduce costs of geological costs is confirmed by Mucha and Dolik (1999) to 
describe, inter alia.:  
- 
optimization of placement of samples in mine excavations – calculations 
allowed to establish an optimum sampling interval which turns more beneficial 
due to the reduction in costs connected with sampling and chemical analyses.  
- 
selection of proper size of samples – on the basis of applied calculations 
with the use of geostatic methods it is stated that the influence of the size of a 
sample on the exactness of estimation is visible only in the case when a random 
component significantly overweighs the random one  
- 
selection of optimum shape of sampling net – it was proved that the value 
of error in contents assessment of one of the elements depends on the shape of the 
net of sampling 
Large meaning of the arrangement of sampling places towards the deposit batch 
assessed is indicated by Mucha (2001). He also pays attention to the fact that 
better effects in the assessment of parameters may be assured by proper 
calculation procedures (probability kriging, „soft” kriging) to recognize 
simultaneously that further extension of mathematic procedures loses its meaning

in connection with little improvement in estimation exactness which can be 
offered (similar opinion of the topic, which is followed by approximate 
conclusions presented by Kokesz (2006a) and Mucha and Stala-Szlugaj, (2002)). 
The issue of influence of initial information on effective usage of geostatistic 
procedures in estimating resources is described also by Kokesz (2006b) to 
emphasize the necessity to recognize the variability structure of the deposit in an 
exact manner, to pay attention to anisotropy and heterogeneity in estimating the 
deposits’ resources.  
For the last couple of decades, the optimisation of the deposit sampling has 
been a problem that interested geostatisticians and mining engineers alike. Walton 
and Kaufman (1982)1, describing the way of choosing a localisation for additional 
drilling holes, state that the variance of estimation can be limited the most by 
drillings in the areas of the highest uncertainty. The analysed region was divided 
into blocks, calculating the variance of estimation for each of these. Next, the 
blocks with the highest variance were chosen in order to localise additional holes 
within those chosen blocks and then evaluate the influence of the drilled holes on 
the global variance of kriging. This process was repeated until the acceptable 
global value was found for the variance of estimation. Gershon (1987) also dealt 
with the problem of localisation of drilling holes and compared various 
approaches to this problem with his own, based on theoretical geostatistics. He 
proposed an algorithm allowing the choice of such localisations for the drilling, 
that minimise the variance of estimation and at the same time limit the number of 
holes and reduce the cost of drilling. Szidarovszky (1983) presents two models 
allowing the choice of the optimal localisation for additional exploratory drillings. 
The first model minimises the variance of estimation and limits the number of 
additional measuring points or lowers the additional measurement costs. The 
second model minimises the number of additional points or lowers the costs and 
preserves the upper bounds accepted for the variation of estimation. These models 
are based on kriging theory and the solutions are based on the appropriate 
algorithm. The solution proposed by Szidarovszky does not take into account the 
three-dimensional geometry of the deposit and the drilling holes. This aspect was 
taken into account by Soltani and Hezarkhani (2013) when dealing with the 
problem of optimisation of localisation of additional exploratory drilling holes. 
In Poland, a lot of attention has been paid to the problem of determining the 
optimal lignite sampling network by analysing the location of the existing holes. 
The researchers looked into the variability structure of qualitative parameters of 
the deposit and the question of estimation of their values using block kriging and 
varying the size of the blocks (Naworyta, Mazurek, 2007). The analysis was made 
taking into account the two following parameters: sand and sulphur content in the 
lignite. The conclusion is that it is sufficient to focus on the analysis of the sulphur 
content in lignite. In the case of sand content, there also is no justification found

for increasing the network density. This is influenced by a greater variability of 
the parameter, the extreme values and low autocorrelation. The level of financial 
expenses, a consequence of drilling additional holes, is shown to be 
disproportionate to the benefits of the improved estimation of the parameter. In his 
subsequent work Naworyta (2007) tries to answer the following question: is it 
possible to choose the sampling network in such a way, so that it is possible to 
estimate the average values of all the interesting parameters of lignite deposits 
with the same level of precision. Comparing the results of estimation after the 
two-fold and three-fold reduction of the drilling holes network, the changes in the 
values of the block kriging standard error were observed. It turs out that the 
network with the lowest number of holes is sufficient to sample the sulphur 
variability structure. Whereas, the estimation of sand content – even in the case of 
the optimal network – was always characterised by a large error. 
This article compares the results reported in literature related to the problem of 
choosing the sampling network for Polish lignite deposits with the results of 
statistical and geostatistical analysis of qualitative data describing one of the 
parameters (the calorific value (Qi
r)). The solutions presented in the 
abovementioned works serve here as guidelines. The main aims were to minimise 
the error by modifying the estimation procedure (by changing the block sizes in 
block kriging and the range of sample searching in the three-dimensional space) 
and to evaluate the estimation effects after the change in the density of  drill holes 
has been made in the analysed deposit area.

Description of the Experimental Material  
The lignite deposit near Bełchatów is located in the Łódź Upland, the Kleszczowa 
graben. The graben is oriented latitudinally. The deposit basis consists of Zechstein, 
Triassic, Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous sediments. The Zechstein deposits are made 
of salt domes, anhydrites and gypsum. On top of them one finds the Tertiary 
compositions with the following complexes: sub-coal, coal and super-coal. The 
layout and deformations of the Tertiary sediments, including the lignite deposit are 
influenced by the tectonic deformations present in the Mesozoic basis. An entire 
area of the deposit is covered by the Quaternary sediments. The deposit is a foredeep 
deposit. Its average volume is more than 50m. It is divided into three fields: 
Szczerców, Bełchatów and Kamieńsk (Konstantynowicz, 1994; Ciuk, 1970).  
We analysed the data made available by the “Bełchatów” Lignite Mine coming 
from the chosen region of the Bełchatów deposit (Szczerców Field). The data 
consist qualitative information from 722 holes, with the total number of samples 
being 15406. Drilling holes orifices located in the area of 12.5.106 m2, are on 
average 132m apart. The drilling holes network is not uniform; the west part 
contains more sample holes (average distance between orifices equals ca. 97m), 
whereas the middle and east part contain noticeably less sample holes (average 
distance between orifices equals ca. 160m), moreover several separated points are 
located on the boundaries. Fig. 1 presents  of drillholes.

Research Methodology and Results 
The geostatistical methods used in cases of regionalised variables (spatial, 
localised) that is those characterised by randomness and structure (non-random) 
were also utilised in our research. Semivariogram is the main function used to 
describe the relationship between geostatistical deposit parameters. Its classic 
form is presented below (Davies, 2002; Mucha, 1994; Clark 1982; Clark, Harper 
2001; Webster, Oliver 2001 ):

Semivariogram is normally defined in reference to geological data for 2D and 3D 
spaces. The calculation of semivariograms is done until such moment, when the

distance h between the points  is equal to half of the maximum distance between 
observations. The limit may also be represented by the number of data pairs which 
ought not to be smaller than 30-50. Empirical semivariogram  is presented in the 
form of a scatter diagram which, in order to be useful in solving geological 
exercises, requires applying one of the analytic functions (Mucha 1994). 
The mathematical model of this function is the basis of kriging and is used to 
decide the feasibility of this approach in a given case.  
Kriging is the most popular geostatistical tool applied for estimating average 
values of parameters of resource deposit (Mucha Dolik, 1999; Nieć, Mucha 2007).  
It is defined as the best linear unbiased systematicness estimator (ang. BLUE – 
Best Linear Unbiased Estimator). Within kriging an unknown value of the 
parametr in the deposit is settled as the weighted average from the pattern (Davies 
2002; Namysłowska-Wilczyńska 2006):

The basic statistics are presented in Table 1; these are the values of arithmetic 
mean, variance, median and the minimal and maximal values of the analysed 
parameter. The calculations were made on the basis of the sets of samples after 
standardisation (regularisation), that is after normalising for length. The length of 
the standardised samples is chosen on the basis of the mode. In the remainder of 
the article, the standardised samples are referred to as composites.

The value of the variability coefficient of the analysed feature equals 18.6%, 
which, according to the five-tier classification of deposits by Baryszew (Mucha 
1994), classifies the analysed deposit region as belonging to Group I, the small 
variability deposits. This is also confirmed by the Figure 2. The distribution of the 
calorific value shows semblance to the normal distribution. On the basis of the 
characteristics of probability density distribution a decision was made that there 
was no necessity to transform the variable. 
3.2 
Geostatistical Analysis 
We begin the analysis of the spatial variability of the parameter by creating a 
semivariogram. A theoretical model is first fitted to the empirical function 
calculated on the basis of all available data from the set of composites (an 
averaged and isotropic variogram), and then the correctness of the model is 
verified using the cross-validation method.  Figure 3 presents the semivariogram 
graph and the parameters describing the function.

The results of cross-validation in the form of diagram of dependence of real 
values of the parameter and the estimated values are presented on fig. 4. The linear 
correlation factor between the presented values equates to 0,789 and was classified 
as high.

Then, the distribution models of the average estimates of calorific value. To 
that end, the ordinary kriging was used. The values of the parameter are estimated 
in blocks. Since the size of blocks influences the estimation errors (Naworyta, 
Mazurek 2007, Jurek et al., 2013), the variability of variance values with the 
increase of block size is evaluated. The analysis is conducted for the following 4 
sizes of blocks (in the XY plane): 50x50, 100x100, 150x150 and 300x300 metres. 
Estimation is conducted for two values of minimal number of samples required in 
estimation: 20 and 30 and evaluating the influence of these values on the 
estimation precision. The results are depicted in the graphs below (Fig. 5) and 
Table 2.

The presented results show that the greater the block size, the smaller the range 
of variance values. More precise parameter estimates can be obtained by 
increasing the required number of samples/attempts. The best results (the lowest 
values of mean, median and range) were obtained for the 300x300 m blocks. 
The next step is to evaluate the impact of sampling density in the area on the 
precision of estimates. In order to allow such an evaluation, nearly 50% of the 
holes are first removed (339 out of 722). The drilling hole network before and 
after the selection is presented on Fig. 6.

Prior to parameter value estimation in blocks, a semivariogram model is 
constructed, taking into account the network changes. Again, it is the Matheron 
spherical model that turned out to be the model describing the variability of the 
parameter in the analysed region. Figure 7 and 8  presents the semivariogram 
graph and results of cross-validation.

results with those presented in Table 2, the differences are clearly visible. 
Additionally, apart from the higher variance values, it is also observed that the 
estimation does not take place in the entire sampled region. Figure 8 presents two 
models: the first one – for the chosen points – the model with the highest value of 
average variance, the second one – for the original drilling network – with the 
lowest value of average variance. The smallest differences between the estimated 
values are visible in the western part of the area, which is more densely sampled. 
Nevertheless, the second model is clearly better in terms of estimation precision.

Summary and Conclusions 
The problem of resource estimation of Polish lignite deposits has been present in 
the literature for no more than two decades. It seems however, that in the last 
couple of years it has considerably gained currency. Most likely, it is related to the 
universal access to specialised software, allowing one to analyse large sets of data. 
The simple analysis presented in this article can be a source of information on the 
level of resources, but also on the quality of the obtained estimation values. These 
can also serve as an indication on how to obtain information allowing one to make 
the decision regarding the location and density of the drilling hole network. Given 
the high cost of drilling, it seems worthwhile, prior to making the decision 
whether to perform the drilling, to first update the qualitative model to see if the 
decision is justified.

The conditional simulation can be used in resource estimation. It is a method 
recommended in risk analysis related to the problem of exceeding critical deposit 
values and evaluation of the forecasted prediction error (Naworyta, Benndorf, 
2012) and one that uses geostatistical parameters to construct a number of equally 
probable qualitative models of the deposit (Jurdziak, Wiktorowicz, 2008b, 
Jurdziak, Kawalec 2011). 
In the case of mineral resource estimation, there are hardly any universally 
applicable solutions but it seems justified to analyse these, which have the 
potential of being implemented and can potentially improve the profitability of 
mining.

Abstract. This paper deals with the real-time regulation of traffic within a disrupted trans-
portation system of a large open pit mine. We outline the necessity of a decision support 
system that detects, analyzes, and resolves the unpredicted disturbances. Due to the distri-
buted aspects of transportation systems, we present a multi-agent approach for the regula-
tion process. Moreover, this approach also includes a genetic algorithm for a programming 
model of the real time rescheduling problems. The genetic algorithm then treats the resche-
duling problem as an optimization and provides the regulator with relevant decisions that 
can result in a partial reconfiguration of the transportation system. 
Keywords: Real time rescheduling, Dispatch system, Genetic Algorithm.

Introduction 
 
Fig. 1 DSS decision-making process 
Since the early 1970s, decision support systems (DSS) technology and  
applications have evolved significantly. Many technological and organizational

developments have made an impact on this evolution. Initially, DSSs possessed 
limited database, modeling and user interface functionality, but technological in-
novations enabled the development of more powerful DSS functionality [1]. DSSs 
are, in fact, computer technology solutions that can be used to support complex 
decision making and problem solving. Decision making is the study of how  
decisions are actually taken, and how they can be better, or more successfully  
taken [2].  
In a DSS decision-making process (Fig. 1), once the problem is recognized, it is 
defined in terms that facilitate the creation actors and of the concerned entities, the 
definition of the decision horizon, of the parameters and the constraints, and also 
the criteria formalization. The resolution stage imposes a choice of an exact or a 
heuristic algorithmic approach. A set of decision proposals is then established 
through the interpretation stage and presented to the concerned actors. The final 
implementation stage consists in applying the operational decisions, supervising 
their impacts, taking corrective actions, and validating the decisions. Carlsson and 
Turban in [3] state that modern support systems research is focused on the theory 
and application of intelligent systems, and soft computing in management. This 
includes processes of problem solving, planning, and decision making. The con-
text for this research ranges from strategic management, business process re-
engineering, effective collaboration, improved user-computer interfaces, and  
mobile and electronic commerce to production, marketing, and financial manage-
ment. The methodologies that are used may be analysis or system-oriented, action 
research or case-based, or they may be experimentally or empirically focused. An 
emerging common denominator for many field studies, favored in DSS, is the de-
sign and use of intelligent (expert systems, multi-agent systems, etc.) and/or soft 
computing systems (evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy logic, etc.). Moreover, in the 
architectures of DSSs, the complexity reduction tools should not curb the combi-
natorial capabilities of the system [4]. For instance, when dealing with a DSS, 
such as on production scheduling systems (PSS), the modeling approaches and the 
resolution tools are based on the study and the analysis of concrete cases coming 
from real problems. Hence, we consider the combined task which includes “satis-
faction needs cooperation needs computational complexity reduction,” as the ma-
jor capability of such a DSS. 
In order to validate the choice of an agent-based approach for the real time 
management of open pit mining transportation systems, it is necessary to grasp the 
characteristics of such an approach. For this reason, we start by defining agents as 
conceptual entities that perceive and act in a proactive, or reactive manner within 
an environment where other agents exist and interact with each other based on 
shared knowledge of communication and representation. A multi-agent system 
(MAS) can then be defined as a loosely coupled network of problem solvers  
interacting to solve problems that are beyond their individual capabilities or know-
ledge. MASs constitute a powerful tool for  handling open, complex, and distri-
buted systems since they offer modularity and abstraction. They are in fact being 
used in an increasingly wide variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and enter-
tainment applications, such as air traffic control. Accordingly, an agent-based  

A Real-Time Regulation Model in Multi-agent Decision Support System

approach seems the most appropriate for studying the real-time control of fleet 
control and dispatch within mining transport networks. In fact, transportation in 
open pit mining systems are complex and therefore, require a set of interacting 
distributed entities. In addition, the global behavior of these systems emerges from 
the individual behavior of the entities and also from their interactions. Hence, traf-
fic disturbance detection, analysis, and resolution are held by a set of cooperating 
agents within a MADSS that assists the regulator in order to provide a better LOS 
for customers by reducing their waiting and route time, and especially by ensuring 
better conditions for connections between the network lines. That is, the MADSS 
has to optimize the different regulation criteria since it can have a more global 
view on the network than the regulator. The present MADSS for open-pit mining 
transport network consists of the following two modules: 
The supervision module, responsible for the supervision of the network traffic 
and the disturbance detection. It is composed of the agents VEHICLE and STOP; 
The regulation module, responsible for the disturbance analysis and the genera-
tion of the appropriate rescheduling measures. It is composed of the agents 
INCIDENT, ZONEPERT, and ZONEREG. The agents of the two modules com-
municate with each other in order to cooperate in the real-time treatment of the 
different incidents (Fig. 2). The regulation module has a hierarchical organization 
with horizontal and vertical communication.  
The roles of the agents will be explained in Sections 2, then some conclusions 
are finally shown in Section 3.

Regulation Module 
This module contains the agents INCIDENT, ZONEPERT, and ZONEREG. It op-
erates in disturbed conditions. It is responsible for the identification, analysis, and 
resolution of the incidents. This rescheduling process needs several simulations in 
order to forecast the impact of the incidents and the regulation decisions on the 
network.  
2.1 
Agent Incident 
An agent STOP, associated to, creates, at, an agent INCIDENT when a distur-
bance caused by appears. Being responsible for the considered disturbance, this 
agent first identifies its characteristics (disturbed haul truck, stop, delay, cause, 
etc.). Then, it creates an agent ZONEPERT for the analysis and the first-level reg-
ulation of the incident. According to the importance of the disturbance, 
INCIDENT can decide to create an agent ZONEREG that will generate several 
possible rescheduling solutions through a genetic approach. This agent has then a 
coordination role in the rescheduling process. Moreover, it must supervise the ar-
rival of the others to avoid regulation conflicts when simultaneous incidents are 
related either in time (haul truck) or in space (stops). These agents propose the re-
levant final rescheduling measures to the regulator. 
2.2 
Agent Zonepert 
This agent has a diagnosis role. It is responsible for the gathering and analysis of 
the information related to the space-time zone affected by the disturbance. In order 
to control the evolution of the disturbances, it is necessary to define first the 
space-time limits of the search space. That is, a space-time horizon has to be iden-
tified by defining the set of haul truck fleets and stops affected by the disturbance 
and the rescheduling measures, according to the real state of the network. The set 
of haul truck fleets describes the time axis of the problem whereas the set of stops 
describes the spatial one. If we assume that is the set of stops of the network and is 
that of all the haul truck fleets, then we have and. Moreover, since the disturbance 
evolves according to time and space, the considered horizon has to be adapted to 
the real changing conditions of the network. It has then to be a dynamic space-
time horizon or window. The schedules that are situated beyond this horizon 
should be equal to the theoretical ones. Consequently, the starting and ending 
points of the haul truck routes in mine have to be respected. It cooperates there-
fore, with a society of agents BUS and STOP, called ZonePert representing the 
horizon. If a connection node belongs to the stops managed by ZONEPERT, then 
ZonePert should include agents representing the other line(s). So, in order to cal-
culate the disturbed schedules, a simulation of the future state of the network is ef-
fected by calculating the estimated passage times of the haul truck fleets at  
the stops of ZonePert. The impact of the incident can be evaluated through a  

A Real-Time Regulation Model in Multi-agent Decision Support System  
259
 
comparison between the theoretical and the disturbed schedules, via the regularity, 
punctuality, and transfer criteria. This impact is then estimated through the com-
putation of, and. Moreover, ZONEPERT generates, at a first strategic level, some 
regulation decisions through a rule-based approach that describes the nature of the 
rescheduling measures adapted to the type of the incident. 
2.3 
Agent ZONEREG 
This agent is created by INCIDENT. It operates by an anytime evolutionary regu-
lation approach that takes into account the several rescheduling criteria and the so-
lutions proposed by ZONEPERT. Through a comparison between the situations 
before and after regulation, ZONEREG considers the regularity, transit, and punc-
tuality criteria that have been previously stated. 
The MADSS regulation module has in fact, a hierarchical organization that can 
be considered as an expert community where each agent is specialized for  
performing a particular task and the solutions are constructed through a mutual  
adjustment (Fig.3). 
2.4 
Fleet Control and Dispatch 
Over the last 10 years computerized dispatch of haul truck fleets has developed  
into highly sophisticated an efficient tool for control and optimization of mine per-
formance. In its control function the existing system provide accurate, real time in-
formation on equipment performance, while a variety of customizable algorithms 
help with optimization of mine performance. The most popular of the dispatch 
systems, DISPATH [5], is used in over 100 mines worldwide. In its most recent 
form it monitors location of mining equipment using a combination of GPS and 
proximity detectors, and collects information on equipment status using a variety 
of electromechanical sensors as well as operator inputs. Both are then processed 
by a computer to develop haul truck assignment that optimize the objectives of 
operation as set by the mine operator. The system is also used to generate a variety 
of site specific reports that accurately reflect mine performance, facilitate perfor-
mance analysis and simulation of operations under changed operating scenarios, 
and the like. 
While the advanced dispatch system are able to define optimum equipment as-
signments that optimize a pre-defined set of production objectives, the last need to 
be defined by a mine planner or operator. Manual customization of dispatch appli-
cation is required if the objectives change, done through customization or adjust-
ment of dispatch proprietary algorithms, some of which are heuristic while others 
use  sophisticated operations research methods.

Equipment Condition and Performance Monitoring 
The current vision in the present work offer monitoring and reporting of three sets 
of parameters: those related to equipment condition, those related to its perfor-
mance (load carried, speed…) and those derived by digital manipulation of the 
first two. The first are of help with failure prevention and diagnostics, the second 
allow accurate production and performance reporting, while the last are normally 
designed to facilitate performance analysis. 
2.6 
Information Module 
This module contains a set of programs for the creation of databases on the pit and 
also for continuous updating of the geological, survey, and technological data. 
The geological section of the database is intended for the storage of primary 
geological information and integration of the data. The primary geological infor-
mation includes core-sample data on bed intersections and intersections of rock li-
thotypes, obtained from geological rifts and trenches. The survey section of the 
database includes information from performance monitoring module. The tech-
nological section of the databases is intended for the storage of information on the 
technical potential of the pit, the parameters of all the technological systems used 
in the pit or considered as options at the design stage. 
2.7 
Design Module 
This module contains the basic programs required for determining the order and 
boundaries of the pits, the output level, and scheduling. The reserves and rate of 
removal are calculated, with differentiation over the levels, terraces, technologi-
cally uniform parcels, and beds and appropriate parameters of the production sys-
tem are determined. 
2.8 
Planning Module 
This module addresses the following geological, survey, and technological prob-
lems: taking account of the movement of resources, preparing accounting docu-
ments, analyzing tachometric survey recordings, calculating production volumes, 
automatic recoding of the current position of the workings on the survey docu-
mentation, calculation of the coal reserves in storage, planning the output volumes 
and the contours of the mine working, and so on.

2.9 
Analyze Problem Module 
This module basically consists of programs for graphical work: making charts and 
plans of the workings. Graphical operations may be performed both in a graph 
plotter and using a printer.  
The six components of the hierarchical organization described above lays a 
firm foundation of the regulation module for open pit mining, but to make it a re-
ality several technologies need further development. Between those are: 
-  The need for all the monitoring, fleet control, dispatch systems to be inte-
grated in a one coherent whole; 
- Eliminate or reduce the need for operator interference into overall system op-
eration; 
- Effective and efficient processing of voluminous data.

In our paper, we present a regulation module in multi-agent decision support sys-
tem for open pit mining that provide mine equipment operator with information 
required to optimize mine performance in terms of mine efficiency and effective-
ness. Shows for the development of the regulation module for open pit mining, 
some work are needed for integrated all components in a one coherent one.

Introduction  
The Hambach opencast mine is located in the Rhenish lignite-mining area and, 
together with the Garzweiler and Inden opencast mines, ensures the supply of 
lignite for the power plants and the refining facilities operated by RWE Power 
AG. In 2013, electricity from Rhenish lignite accounted for some 13% of Germa-
ny's total power consumption, equivalent to an absolute electricity volume of 
82TWh, for which about 86 million tonnes of coal were used. Including the deli-
veries to the refining facilities, total output was 98 million tonnes.

In this period, the Hambach mine produced roughly 31 million tonnes of coal 
for power generation. Another 12 million tonnes were used in the refining facili-
ties to make products like briquettes, pulverised lignite and coke. To expose the 
coal, it was necessary to remove 236 million m³ of overburden and to raise more 
than 280 million m³ of water. 
Besides the economic and entrepreneurial aspects involved, the operation and 
steering of a large-scale opencast mine involves numerous other activities. Thus, 
regular day-to-day busi-ness has to take account of environmental and public 
acceptance issues in addition to the actual mining work, along with approval-law 
and, increasingly, political questions as well.

Geology and Mining Field  
The mining field of the Hambach mine has a surface of approx. 8,500 ha and 
stretches between the parishes of Niederzier and Elsdorf, being bounded in the 
south by the Aachen-Cologne railway line. The total quantity of mineable coal 
located in the planning area amounted originally to some 2.5 billion tonnes, of 
which about 1 billion tonnes have already been mined since the start of extraction. 
The total overburden to be moved amounted to 15.4 billion m³, which translates 
into an overburden-to-coal ratio (O:C) of 6.2 : 1 (m³:t).

Underlying Energy-Policy and Energy-Management 
Conditions  
3.1 
Lignite and the Energy Transition 
The energy sector in Germany is currently caught up in a phase of fundamental 
change. The growing feed-in of renewable energy is leading to long-term price 
erosion on the power ex-changes. The reason is the daily course of the feed-in, 
with a peak in the consumption-heavy midday hours, above all from photovol-
taics. This ousts peak-load power plants with their priceforming effect. New hard-
coal power stations or lignite-based power plants come to form the price. This 
effect has now made inroads into the prices of forward electricity trading as well.  
On the other hand, at times of low feed-in of renewable electricity, virtually the 
entire peak consumption still has to be supplied by power stations firing conven-
tional energy sources. This still means constant high requirements to be met by the 
availability of lignite power plants – coupled with high flexibility – in order to 
offset the volatility of the renewable feed-in. In this way, lignite power stations are 
becoming important, dependable and flexible partners for renewables in the  
energy transition. 
3.2 
Regional Economic Importance  
Lignite is not only an important guarantor of secure and low-cost power genera-
tion in Germany: with its value-add, it is also a major economic factor of both 
regional and nationwide importance.  
In 2012, RWE Power had a direct workforce of some 13,000 in lignite mining, 
power generation and refining. A total of around 41,000 employees depend direct-
ly or indirectly on Rhenish lignite.  
In addition, the Rhenish lignite-mining area places orders, mainly for mainten-
ance material and replacement investment, amounting to approx. €1 billion and – 
year in, year out – trains about 750 young people in some 20 different vocations.

The Opencast Mine and Its Environs  
4.1 
Large-Scale Mining in a Conurbation 
The Hambach opencast mine is located in one of Germany's most densely popu-
lated regions, with over 50,000 people living in the mine's immediate environs, 
some of them in townships directly adjacent to the mining field.  
People in the neighbourhood of the mine perceive its operations in the most 
various of ways. One of the main challenges facing management – besides the 
organisational and technical measures for emission control and noise abatement – 

266 
H.-J. Bertrams
 
 
is to stay in touch with its neighbours, to have an open ear for people's concerns, 
and to nurture partnership-based relations.  
4.2 
Resettlement and Relocation Facilities  
Lignite mining in opencast operations is necessarily associated with complete use 
of the land affected for extraction purposes. In addition to nature and infrastruc-
ture, there are townships, too, to be relocated. For local residents, this involves 
extraordinary burdens, so that the main focus of attention must lie on appropriate, 
socially compatible conditions.  
2012 saw the start of the programme to resettle the Kerpen-Manheim parish, 
and resettlement of the Morschenich district belonging to the Merzenich munici-
pality commences in 2014.  
In the course of the further development of the mine in an easterly direction and 
to the south, there are additional infrastructural facilities to be relocated. Most of 
the planning and approval procedures this requires began already in the early 
1990s.  
One substantial measure is the partial relocation of the Company's own coal 
railway, the so-called Hambachbahn. This two-track, electrified railway line han-
dles the transport of lignite from the Hambach mine to the power plants and refin-
ing facilities, and crosses approx. 9km of the pre-mining area. The new route runs 
east around the mining field in parallel with the German Railways Cologne-
Aachen line and with the new route of the A4 federal autobahn.  
The existing A4 runs for some 9km through the mining field of the Hambach 
opencast mine be-tween Düren and Kerpen. Around 2017, the opencast mine will 
reach the existing autobahn route. The switchover of the A4 to the new route will 
take place as early as 2014.  
4.3 
Approval-Law Stipulations  
The Hambach opencast mine is operated under the supervision of the Arnsberg 
regional government on the basis of approved operating plans (Betriebspläne). 
The master operating plans (Rahmenbetriebspläne) are produced and applied for 
under the responsibility of a central unit for all three opencast mines in the mining 
area. Applications for main and special operating plans, by contrast, are usually 
worked out by the opencast mine concerned and/or by the technical department in 
charge. After approval, adherence to any ancillary provisions it contains is the 
responsibility of management.  
In the course of the mining operating-plan procedure (bergrechtliches Be-
triebsplanverfahren), numerous subjects are dealt with – specifically those of 
relevance for the environment. In particular, in the wake of the amendment of 
Germany's Federal Nature Conservation Act in 2007, there is now an even strong-
er focus on species protection.

To create new habitats for endangered animal species, on the one hand, and to 
enable the animals to migrate to further adequate habitats – here, specifically, old 
forest stocks in the areas of Kerpen and Nörvenich – on the other, so-called "guide 
structures" have been created since 2011. For this purpose, surfaces previously 
used for farming are usually bought by RWE Power and ecologically upgraded or 
partially afforested, or old forest stocks ecologically upgraded. 
 
Fig. 3 Guide structures  
A further approval-law stipulation for operating an opencast mine is the inves-
tigation and analysis of archaeological finds in the mining area. Here, work is in 
close collaboration with the Rhenish Office for the Preservation of Historical 
Monuments (Rheinisches Amt für Denkmalpflege). The archaeological work is 
financed by a foundation jointly set up by RWE Power and the State government. 
Also, the opencast mine provides hands-on support during excavations by provid-
ing staff and equipment. In this way, the conflict between land use for mining and 
the claims of the preservation of historical monuments can be minimised. 
4.4 
Neighbourhood Protection, Emission Control and Noise 
Abatement  
A mining project in a conurbation necessarily has points of contact with the 
neighbourhood. The extraction and dumping sides of the Hambach mine, for in-
stance, brush the outskirts of the town of Elsdorf some 300m away.

Operation of an opencast mine is inevitably associated with dust and noise 
emissions. To minimise nuisance levels in the adjacent townships, the Hambach 
opencast mine takes numerous planning, technical and organisational mitigation 
measures. The basic aim here is to operate the mine in such a way that despite the 
encumbrances due to the mine operation the highest possible public acceptance is 
achieved and the trust of the people in the region is safeguarded.  
Emission control and noise abatement are thus accorded great significance.  
To protect direct residents, embankments and/or walls are erected in the areas 
of parishes. The opencast-mine equipment and facilities are operated according to 
the state of the art in noise abatement. In addition, the drives of excavators, 
spreaders and conveyor belts are encased to contain noise, and noise-lowered 
conveyor-belt idlers are used. Within the scope of what is operationally possible, 
organisational noise-abatement measures, too, are taken. For instance, the work of 
auxiliary equipment is minimised during the night. 
 
 
Fig. 4 Emission control – Noise abatement 
The exposed opencast-mine surface at Hambach measures approx. 38km². This 
circumstance, if weather conditions are conducive, can give rise to coarse-dust 
emissions in the environs. To minimise the dust load emitted from the opencast 
mine, a multitude of dust-combating measures have been and are being developed, 
operated and refined in the course of the mine’s development.

As a planning measure, the embankments created in locations close to town-
ships are also making a contribution here. In wind-critical areas, they are equipped 
with sprinklers and/or sprayer masts throughout. These measures have proved 
their worth, especially in mitigating dust emissions from the opencast mine. The 
primary aim, however, is to avoid the emergence and whirlup of dust in the first 
place.  
To this end, bark mulch is spread on longer lying surfaces and slopes in the 
opencast mine, or they are greened by sowing. The surfaces first covered and 
stabilised by plant growth in this way have lower coarse-dust emissions and are 
also less prone to erosion. 
 
 
Fig. 5 Emission control – Dust prevention 
Technical emission control measures on large-scale equipment units and open-
cast-mine facilities, like belt sprinklers or spraying systems at the transfer substa-
tions of the belt routes, are now standard at Hambach. Further water-related pollu-
tion-control facilities are also used, like stationary or mobile rotary sprinklers on 
conveyor belts and/or in open-air spaces. Roads, as well as surfaces subject to the 
rough travel action of auxiliary equipment, are continuously sprayed with water, 
especially if the weather is critical, in order to minimise dust emissions from mov-
ing vehicles. In addition, each staff member can make a contribution to successful 
airpollution control. The Hambach workforce are regularly trained and instructed 
in behaviour with emission control in mind. Moreover, personnel are regularly

informed about emission control issues by suitable messages on information dis-
plays in the washhouse area.  
The coarse-dust burden in the environs of the Hambach mine is continuously 
measured by an independent institute at a total of 29 measuring points. To assess 
the dust precipitation, the Technical Instructions on Air Quality (TA Luft) set an 
annual mean value. The dust-precipitation values read at the mine rim have always 
been well below this value. Although severe storms may in principle cause dust 
whirl-ups of exposed surfaces despite the measures taken, such events are ex-
tremely rare and usually do not last long.  
Besides the visible coarse dust, it is the fine dust which is not visible to the hu-
man eye, which has increasingly been in the spotlight in recent years. Fine dust 
has numerous sources, for many of which human activity is answerable. Fine dust 
emerges both in combustion processes in industry, households and traffic, and, in 
opencast-mine operations, also in grain crushing, eg during materials handling. 
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), fine dust from terrestrial 
sources is less toxic than fine dust from combustion or metallurgical processes.  
Since the beginning of fine-dust measurements in Niederzier in 2004, the an-
nual mean value of the fine-dust burden (40μg/m³) set by the EU has been reliably 
met. However, the permissible daily mean value for PM10 (50μg/m³ on more than 
35 days) has been exceeded in 3 years since 2005. Hence, in a first step, an action 
plan for clean air was drawn up and, in 2012, a so called “clean-air plan” produced 
for the environs of the Hambach mine.

In the course of the procedure, the share of the Hambach mine in the overall 
concentration was first calculated at 25%. The rest stemmed from diffuse sources 
and could not be assigned to specific emitters. In cooperation with independent 
institutes, numerous measures were worked out and taken by the Hambach mine 
to lower the fine-dust concentration. These included, eg, the installation of high-
pressure spraying systems on the bucket wheels of the coal excavators, the opera-
tion of mobile dust-consolidation machines, the building of a tyre-washing facility 
as well as many more technical and organisational measures. 
Since 2011, all threshold values have been met again at the Niederzier measur-
ing point. In addition, the findings of the State environment office have confirmed 
the efficacy of the measures taken. For instance, the share of the Hambach mine in 
the region's fine-dust volume has fallen to a mere 11%. This development is also 
due not least to the fact that existing emission control measures have been steadily 
improved, with additional measures being developed that go beyond the original 
action plan, while all staff members have been called upon to display environmen-
tally compatible behaviour.  
5 
Opencast-Mine Operation  
The Hambach mine has a workforce of approx. 1,500, along with some 750 em-
ployees (full-time equivalents) of partner companies. In terms of function, Ham-
bach is organised in a production, a mechanical-engineering and an electrical-
engineering department. For administrative tasks, the so called “Bergtechnik” 
department reports directly to management. 
5.1 
Health & Safety  
The safety and security of the personnel employed has been writ large in the oper-
ations of Rhenish lignite mining for decades now. In the last 15 years this point – 
true to the motto "No work is so important and urgent that we may jeopardise the 
health of our employees" – has been prioritised by management. Executives unre-
servedly subscribe to the principle: "We do not want accidents!" and are also pre-
pared to act accordingly. The success of the efforts made on behalf of industrial 
safety depends strongly on the personal commitment of the executive staff, a pres-
ence on the spot and on the systematic action of supervisors. Industrial safety 
tolerates no compromises. The success of the action taken is reflected in  
Hambach's accident figures. 
 

272 
H.-J. Bertrams
 
 
 
Fig. 7 Accident figures 
In the nature of things, improvements become harder and harder to obtain, the 
closer you get to the zero line. A crucial breakthrough was achieved here when the 
efforts on behalf of industrial safety focused on staff behaviour, and employees 
became involved in solving safety problems in a spirit of eye-level partnership. 
This approach involves "behaviour-oriented visits" by senior executives and "brief 
safety talks" with supervisors on the spot.  
5.2 
Continuous Improvement  
The feed-in of apparently low-cost electricity from wind and solar is leading to a 
tougher com-petitive situation on the energy market. The energy source 'lignite' has 
to face more and more competition. Here – for market-related reasons – mining only 
has levers on the cost side if it wants to improve its result. The improvement 
processes required to maintain competitiveness are compelling a constant analysis of 
the processes and the organisation of the Company's fields of action. For this pur-
pose, the Hambach mine has established a continuous improvement process (CIP) 
going by the name "immer:besser" ("getting better and better") that is firmly inte-
grated into its structures. Principals, as "users of ideas", are continually on the loo-
kout for improvement potentials. In their efforts, they can harness the experience 
and knowledge of their staff. Administrative support comes from so called “idea 
coaches”. At the start of 2013, RWE Power also launched a programme for the 
sustainable underpinning of competitiveness under the heading "NEO".

5.3 
Energy and Environmental Management  
Prudent and effective use of the available resources is a fundamental precondition 
for economic action and for achieving a long-term secure position in a competitive 
situation. The most recent developments on Germany's energy market, too, are 
reason enough for thematising the effective use of resources in lignite mining and 
in electricity generation from lignite.  
Extracting lignite in opencast operations requires a not inconsiderable energy 
input, chiefly electric energy. In 2013, the energy input in the three opencast pits 
in the Rhenish mining area amounted to just under 3.1TWh (incl the raising of 
water throughout the mining area), equivalent to approx. 4% of the electricity 
produced there. Effective monitoring and pinpointed controlling of the specific 
energy consumed by the mine, supplemented to include a focus on energy effi-
ciency in procurement and operating processes, are the aims of energy manage-
ment in lignite mining. As a consequence of the - at present - unstable electricity 
market prices maintenance activities are rescheduled to periods with high prices. 
Operational costs can be reduced by running mining processes at full capacity 
during periods characterised by low electricity prices. 
In 2013, Hambach was the first location in the mining area to introduce an 
energy-management system certified by an independent body. One module of 
energy management in operations is a pinpointed focus on energetic subjects in 
the CIP. Employees and executives are informed and sensitised on energy-
efficiency topics both in regular talks and via the location's internal communica-
tions.  
In view of the substantive links between energy and the environment, the Ham-
bach mine's environmental management was certified at the same time. This main-
ly involved the relevant processes resulting from approval procedures, official 
stipulations and action in the public relations area; these have, in principle, been 
practised in mining for decades without leading to complaints and have been do-
cumented and, in this way, made transparent. Certification of the environmental 
management has confirmed the standard of work and activity at Hambach.  
5.4 
Partner-Company Management  
Operations at Hambach are supported by numerous partner companies. If the goals 
of industrial safety and health are to be achieved, a number of measures have to be 
taken together with the partner companies. To this end, Hambach engages in part-
ner-company management.  
This starts with the selection of firms and the award of contracts. The rule is 
that the opencast mines now only employ partner companies that are certified in 
industrial safety. Before beginning any work at Hambach, all partner-firm em-
ployees receive instructions on the location's special features and on fundamental 
safety issues. Only after a successful check of knowledge levels and upon submis-
sion of a safety pass may partner firms' personnel commence work in the opencast 

274 
H.-J. Bertrams
 
 
mine. Moreover, risk assessments must be drawn up and reviewed with the client. 
In the execution of their work, the partner firms are monitored by supervisors and 
by the location's Industrial Safety unit. This is done by random sampling in 
workplace inspections, by regular talks with management and, in the wake of 
unsafe actions or of accidents, by appropriate consequences in the form of an 
escalation programme.  
The overall picture of a partner firm in industrial-safety terms is documented 
within the scope of a supplier and/or industrial-safety assessment.  
5.5 
Operations Management Systems  
One key precondition for an economic design of processes is the systematic im-
provement of the efficiency of plants and personnel using modern operations con-
trol instruments. RWE Power has been engaged in their development and rollout 
ever since the end of the 1990s. Besides opencast-mine and extraction planning, 
the chief focus here is on the main processes, like excavation, transport and dump-
ing and/or bunker management and coal logistics. 
Starting out from the long- or medium-term opencast-mine planning based on a 
digital deposit model, complex applications for pinpointed short-term and equip-
ment planning have been created in recent years. The underlying aim has been to 
optimise the mine's material scheduling, which is subject to numerous dependen-
cies and restrictions. The core task here was the combination and continuous cali-
bration of the deposit model using data from the actual situation at the working 
face as well as an orderly dump structure based on dumping schemes. Building up 
on this, it should be possible to simulate potential scenarios and to outline optimi-
sation processes.  
The basis of such a system is real-time data from the mining equipment units 
on their position and movements. The development of the satellite-assisted exca-
vator and spreader operation control (SABAS/SATAS) in 2002 created the basis 
for a downstream production- and material-management system. To this very day, 
the applications – some of which were developed and successfully deployed by 
the Hambach mine – have been and are still being continually optimised. Besides 
these advances, systems for the control of auxiliary processes in the opencast mine 
were also developed and optimised. These mainly include applications for sche-
duling auxiliary equipment or the monitoring of water-management systems.  
5.6 
Scheduling and Mass Distribution  
The planning of mining operations in an opencast mine covers various periods of 
time, with a basic distinction being made between long-, medium- and short-term 
planning horizons. Strategic long-term planning affects an opencast mine across 
its entire life cycle, all the way to the end of mining supervision after the land 
surface has been reinstated. Medium-term planning covers each next five-year 
period.

Fig. 8 M2 extraction, transport and dumping 
An opencast mine's planning department schedules one-year periods all the way 
to seam-focused equipment use and standstill planning. The various planning 
horizons are interlinked in the form of control loops. Planning the coming shifts, 
days and weeks is a daily iterative task at an opencast mine. Besides mine opera-
tional planning and maintenance aspects, the factors impacting a mine's operation 
and, hence, the variables in such rolling mining equipment planning, specifically 
include further mining-related subjects like geology and hydrology, geomechanics 
and equipment technology.  
For periods of up to one year, a computer-aided extraction plan is drawn up to 
take account of all important factors that affect an opencast mine's operations. 
This tool can map, block by block, the operation of the mining equipment units 
with position-dependent output data, maintenance and preparatory-work dates. In 
this way, it is possible to steer the excavator’s digging operations, especially as 
regards the scheduling of difficult-to-dump overburden masses, and to precisely 
forecast a mine's output in the period under review.  
The operation of the mining equipment and the daily steering of operations at 
the Hambach mine are marked in particular by its geology and hydrological condi-
tions. Besides sands and gravels, the overburden which sits atop the coal mainly 
consists of a not inconsiderable share of clays and silts. The safe discharge of just

this overburden from the extraction side on an inside dump with 7 spreader 
benches and a height of just under 600m are the constant features of the deploy-
ment of the mining equipment. The daily scheduling of the overburden removal is 
mainly determined by the limited availability of dump space for unstable mixed 
soil. For the safe and stable build-up of the inside dump, a dumping scheme was 
developed for the controlled dumping of the various overburden qualities. The 
dumping principle is based on a system of pinpointedly created dams of stable 
material (so called “M1”) that can be used to form polders in which unstable 
mixed soil (so called “M2”) can be discharged.  
5.7 
Mining of Clay Ironstone  
Besides a high share of unstable interstratifications containing clay-silty sedi-
ments, it is above all highly consolidated clays and clay ironstone deposits on the 
5th and 6th bench that continue to impede the whole extraction process (incl. trans-
port and dumping). Most of the irregular, in places also thickly bedded, clay iron-
stone deposits are encountered in the central to northern area of the bench con-
cerned. The clay ironstones mainly consist of siderite with varying clay shares 
and, together with the surrounding clays, form a compact, very hard structure. 
Precise spatial exploration of the clay ironstone deposits is possible only with 
qualifications owing to their irregular distribution. It must be assumed, however, 
that – in the medium to long term – these compacted layers must still be expected 
on the 5th and 6th benches.  
The compacted clay ironstone strata cause serious problems during excavation. 
For one thing, only low extraction volumes can be achieved where the bucket-
wheel technology is used. For another, the material leads to higher wear and tear, 
specifically in the case of the bucket wheels and conveyor belts and of the transfer 
substations.  
Ever since clay ironstones were encountered for the first time, numerous 
processes and measures have been trialled at Hambach to ensure output-optimised 
and wear-minimising extraction. These included blasting trials or advance loosen-
ing of material by auxiliary equipment. These approaches were not pursued any 
further for technical and cost reasons.  
Besides the structural reinforcement of transfer substations and the steel con-
struction of the conveyor belts and the large-scale units, it was the development of 
buckets specially optimised for clay ironstone that brought a sustainable im-
provement. Ever since their first deployment in 2009, these specialised buckets 
have been continuously further developed. In fact, deployment of bucket-wheel 
excavators in clay ironstone is receiving in-depth engineering support beyond the 
usual measure.

Coal Qualities in the Hambach Opencast Mine  
Another pace-setter in daily operations – specifically on the lower extraction 
benches – is the range of coal varieties occurring there or about to be accessed by 
the excavator, in conjunction with the quantities and qualities demanded by the 
coal logistics.  
The coal in the Hambach opencast mine can mostly be extracted in a thickness 
of some 70m and a bench length of about 3.5km. The quality of the coal is marked 
by high calorific values, in part by a high sodium and potassium content and fluc-
tuating iron values. A high calorific value and the chemical composition of Ham-
bach's coal mean that, in the older boilers of lignite-fired power plants, there is a 
risk of ash caking on the boiler tubes. For this reason, a system for feeding the 
power stations with coal tailored to the boiler was developed, which means that, in 
daily scheduling, a distinction must be made between 7 different boiler coal varie-
ties. For some years now, the Hambach mine has been the sole supplier of the 
refining facilities, and has made available 2 further coal varieties in quantity and 
quality for the dry-lignite market.

Opencast-Mine Drainage  
Digging deep-lying seams in an opencast mine is not possible without comprehen-
sive drainage measures. The deep wells required for this are operated on the ex-
traction benches, in the premining areas and on the opencast mine's rim areas.  
The aim of effective dewatering operations is the maximum utilisation of the 
well infrastructure. This aim conflicts with the obstacle-free operation of the min-
ing equipment. So, what matters is having in-pit wells operated until just before 
the arrival of mining operations and then, as soon as possible, putting the plough-
ed-under wells back into operation. Timely decommissioning and re-
commissioning requires close daily review and coordination with the Production 
department and the specialist units involved.  
For the dewatering measures, Hambach currently uses some 200 in-pit wells. 
Roughly the same number is operated in the pre-mining area. This raises about 
280 million m³ of water annually. Besides the raising and discharging of the well 
water, all benches maintain an extensive infrastructure for surface dewatering, 
consisting of trench systems for rainwater and residual rock waters, temporary 
dewatering sumps and discharge systems. In the stationary area are water-
retention basins and sedimentation tanks as collection systems from which the free 
waters are pumped via mine-water purification plants to the higher-level piping 
system. Both the well network and its discharge pipes and the surface-dewatering 
system are each monitored and controlled by computer.

5.10 Morschenich Colliery  
With the aim of achieving a high degree of self-sufficiency in raw materials for 
Germany in the 1940s, various projects were launched at the time to trial under-
ground lignite mining. One of these projects was the Morschenich colliery (under-
ground lignite mine "Union 103") in the municipality of the same name. As the 
opencast mine progresses, the underground structure has to make way for mining 
operations.  
The mining activities at the Morschenich colliery were confined to sinking two 
shafts to a depth of some 330m and a roadway system in the lignite seam along a 
total distance of some 12km. Owing to recurrent water penetration, the under-
ground activities were discontinued as early as 1950 without any commercial 
extraction having taken place. In 1960, the underground structure was flooded 
after protective measures had been taken to enable later re-commissioning.

The opencast mine's first bench reached the first section of the underground 
structure in 2011 with shaft 2. In a costly procedure, the first 40m of the shaft 
column were dismantled in special operations down to the excavator's operating 
level. At the start of 2012, in a second dismantling step, shaft 1 was used up by the 
first bench and dismantled. The opencast mine first cut through the roadway sys-
tem on the 6th bench in early 2014.

5.11 Recultivation  
High-quality recultivation of depleted areas is writ large at the Hambach opencast 
mine. Here, the mine is not only building on its own experience of several decades 
of successful recultivation, but – for the sake of continuous improvements in this 
field – is also collaborating with research institutes, universities and independent 
experts from environmental protection, forestry and agriculture.  
In recultivation, what counts basically is not merely restoring the landscape 
used by an open-cast mine the way it was prior to mining. Rather, the aim is to 
offer Nature a basis for a land-scape that is at least of the same high quality, so 
that the recultivated areas integrate quickly into the existing cultivated landscape. 
 
 
Fig. 12 Recultivation at Hambach mine 
The "Sophienhöhe" heights, the outside dump of the Hambach mine, rises some 
300m MSL and is a major landscape feature. There and on the adjacent inner 
dump of the mine, ten million trees have been planted as saplings since the mine 
was first developed. The oldest populations are now aged over 30. The variety of 
the trees, shrubs and wild flora, either especially planted or else the result of vo-
luntary settlement, is in line with the typical vegetation of the Rhineland. In addi-
tion, the recultivated Hambach opencast mine now also offers a home to numerous 
protected species of domestic flora and fauna.

On the various terraces of "Sophienhöhe", numerous water surfaces and bio-
topes have been created, but some surfaces have been deliberately not afforested, 
being left to free succession.  
"Sophienhöhe" is now a popular outing destination for quiet recreation. A hik-
ing trail network of some 100km has been created and is open for public use.  
The recultivation of the Hambach opencast mine is making an important con-
tribution toward retaining and increasing the acceptance of lignite mining in the 
region and of work in the mine.  
6 
Upshot  
Operating a large-scale opencast mine involves a whole host of tasks and chal-
lenges. In addition to the commercial aspects that must be considered, it is above 
all technical mining issues that determine the day-to-day business of mine man-
agement. Still, account also has to be taken of the underlying conditions set by 
geology and the deposit as well as environmental-policy and approval-law issues.  
What is more, decisions arising on a daily basis increasingly include the side 
effects of Ger-many's energy transition. The fiercer competitive situation on Eu-
rope's energy market has an effect on Hambach, all the way to excavator and 
spreader. 
Besides economic factors, all the processes in an opencast mine, starting with 
dewatering and clearing the pre-mining area, via overburden removal and dump-
ing, coal extraction and recultivation, as well as all concomitant processes, always 
have to be in harmony with higher-ranking interests and stipulations, like neigh-
bourhood protection, air-pollution control and noise abatement.  
Besides these aspects, which are concerned more with planning and operation, 
there are leadership and management tasks, which are further important compo-
nents in the day-to-day business of operating an opencast mine. These include, in 
particular, the promotion and active implementation of industrial safety. This is 
true both of the company’s own workforce and of all partners. Our fundamental 
goal, by having a corresponding operational organisation as well as unequivocal 
delegation of tasks and responsibilities, is to ensure safe, economic and proper 
mine operations.  
The creation of transparency in opencast mining operations by stepping up pub-
lic-relations work in the neighbourhood and by an in-depth dialogue with local 
politicians and institutions will go on being of undiminished importance. Not least 
also owing to the energy transition and developments on the energy market, ex-
tending and stabilising the public acceptance of the work in an opencast mine and 
of the 'lignite system’ in the direct environs are tasks of growing significance.

“Best Practice” Concepts for a Fast-Track 
Lignite Mine Opening 
Christos J. Kolovos

Abstract. The paper presents the unusually rapid opening of the Mavropigi lignite 
mine in the Western Macedonia area, Northern Greece. Three mines, employing 
totally 9-10 small to medium sized Bucket Wheel Excavators (BWEs) and 
producing annually 7-8 million tons of lignite, were scheduled to close between 
2006 and 2010 and be replaced by a new bigger mine. The transition from the 
three closing mines to the new one had to be planned carefully, in order to 
maintain the total annual lignite production level. Proper short-term mine planning 
and design of both the initial box-cut and of the first benches, permitted the 
deployment of four BWEs within a 13-month period, an achievement 
acknowledged as “best practice”.

Introduction 
Public Power Corp. of Greece SA (PPC), the biggest utility company in Greece, is 
a major lignite surface mine operator. The total PPC lignite production for 2012 
reached 61.74 million tons (Mt) in the 2 major lignite-mining complexes in 
Western Macedonia (Northern Greece, 52.14Mt) and Peloponnese (Southern 
Greece, 9.6Mt). Lignite is used for power generation, contributing to almost 50% 
of the national demand. Three small local minor producers in the Western 
Macedonia area also sell mostly to PPC Power Plants. 
The size of the deposit in the Western Macedonia area, its energy importance 
and the oil crises in the 1970’s led to further development of mining operations. In 
2002, a peak production of 55.8Mt was achieved by PPC’s Western Macedonia 
Lignite Center (WMLC). The main activity takes place in the basin between the 
towns of Kozani and Ptolemais, (Fig. 1), where three main and some minor mines 
are currently developed, while another mine is developed further north in the 
Amynteon basin, between the towns of Ptolemais and Amynteon. 
The multilayer type deposit necessitates selective excavation. Mining in PPC 
mines employs bucket wheel excavators (BWEs) for both the soft overburden and 
the multi-layer lignite deposit. Harder overburden formations are handled with 
blasting and shovel + heavy truck systems or contractor operations. Contractor 
backhoes have also excavated an increasing proportion of the lignite deposit 
during recent years.

The Mavropigi Lignite Mine Case 
2.1 
The Mine Concept 
The Main Field Mine was the first mine opened in the area in the late 50’s and its 
reserves were mined out by the mid 80's. The main equipment (BWEs-conveyor 
belts-stackers) was utilized to open new operations at the adjacent Northern Field 
and the Komanos Field Mines (Fig.1). By the mid 90's, the East Komanos 
operation had been developed separately. These three mines, employing totally 9-
10 small to medium sized BWEs of different types and producing annually 7-8 
million tons of lignite, were scheduled to close between 2006 and 2010. 
PPC had been planning the Komnina Mine at the Amynteon area, north of the 
Ptolemais town, for several years in the late 80’s, and both a detailed mine study 
and an environmental study had already been prepared by 1991. However, the 
decision was never implemented due to the very promising borehole results at  
the Western Field of the Kozani-Ptolemais basin; the decision to develop the 
Mavropigi Mine was made in 1995.  
Rheinbraun Engineering (RE), -a subsidiary of the German energy company 
RWE-, undertook the initial design and planning of the new mine as part of the 
Western Macedonia Technical Mine Master Plan Project (PPC SA-RE, 1996). The 
Western Field was divided by RE into two parts, the Northwestern and the 
Southwestern Field. The Northwestern Field was preferred over the Komnina 
Field as a new mine, due to the favorable deposit conditions, whereas the 
Southwestern Field is planned to be exploited in the forthcoming years as an 
extension to the Kardia/Sector 6 mine. The original mine name “Northwestern 
Field” was changed in June 1996 to honor the nearby Mavropigi village.  
According to the RE planning (1995-96, Fig. 2), the Mavropigi Mine was 
initially scheduled to open from the SE side and advance in a clockwise slewing 
operation to the north, producing up to 6Mt per annum. The main advantage of 
this solution was the capability for an early development of the internal dump; low 
production and the early disruption of the Mavropigi village connecting road were 
the main disadvantages.

Fig. 2 Mavropigi Mine: RE initial design 
After an extensive discussion with PPC, an alternative solution was adopted in 
1996 (Fig. 3); to open the mine from the northern side and advance counter-
clockwise to the south, in order to obtain a more stable production rate for a longer 
period. The excavation of the Mavropigi village connecting road area was also 
postponed for some years. The key point in adopting the second solution was the 
result of the geotechnical stability studies, which indicated that a much smaller 
than the originally anticipated pillar could be abandoned towards the nearby 
Ptolemais Power Plant (Kolovos C., 2013).

The deepest part of the mine is in sectors 1 and 2, with a maximum depth of 
about 180m and the mine design includes 8 benches/BWEs. Due to the fact that the 
mine would be opened with already existing equipment, it was possible to pre-assign 
every available BWE, according to their excavating capacity and their suitability for 
overburden or lignite deposit excavation, to a specific bench of the new mine.

The expropriation of the land for the first 5-year mine life was completed at the 
end of 1999. However, the residents of the nearby Mavropigi village insisted that 
the village had to be relocated and refused to allow entry of PPC equipment into 
the expropriated land; a court decision to expel the villagers was obtained at the 
end of 2000. The environmental permit was issued in September 2001 and the 
excavations for the initial box-cut commenced in October 2001 (contractor 
backhoes + on-highway trucks).   
The final pit limit, which was originally drawn by RE at a distance of 38m from 
the village cemetery, had to be redrawn in 1997 and moved further away from the 
village, at the distance permitted by the Greek Mining Regulation, (minimum 
250m from the village and cemetery perimeter). In January 2002, in an effort to 
assure the safety of the village, PPC moved the final pit limit at a distance of 
500m away from the village perimeter, double than the minimum distance 
permitted by the Greek Mining Regulation (Fig. 4). The Komanos village, shown 
inside the Mavropigi pit limit, had been relocated years ago.

2.2 
Modifications in Mine Design and Planning 
There was an almost 3-year delay in the opening of the new mine, which resulted 
in production issues for the entire WMLC. The operations at the three closing 
mines (Northern Field, Komanos Field, East Komanos, all under the local 
administration of the Main Field Mine) had to be extensively rescheduled and 
redesigned, so that no BWE would be without assignment and stand still for 
months, waiting to be moved to the new mine. The transition from the three 
closing mines to the new one had to be planned carefully, in order to maintain the 
total annual lignite production level.  
Adding contractor equipment to accelerate box-cut excavations was not feasible 
at the time: in 2001-2002, almost every piece of contractor equipment in Greece 
was employed in Athens, preparing the 2004 Olympic Games facilities and it

proved difficult to find available contractors to accelerate the opening of the 
Mavropigi Mine. Low supply and high demand for contractor equipment had also 
significantly increased the price per cubic meter excavated. As an aftermath, “un-
orthodox" ways to accelerate operations had to be examined, which resulted in an 
extended redesign of the initial phase of the mine (Kolovos, 2004a). It is also 
mentioned that since the BWEs are rather old (initial deployment year between 
1958 and 1970), an extended maintenance program was planned to be applied to 
the BWEs, whenever a BWE would be moved to the new mine. This program was 
planned to last a minimum of three months and be applied just before it would 
start operations to the new mine. The maintenance program could not run during 
the winter months, due to heavy winter in the area, therefore it had to be scheduled 
to run within the remaining months.  
All the necessary revisions and amendments to the original mine planning 
affected the short and mid-term production planning, and, as a result, they were 
assigned to the Main Field internal mine planning unit. 
2.2.1 
The Rolling 5-Year Monthly Timetable Tool 
A rolling 5-year monthly timetable tool (Fig. 5), in the form of a Gantt chart, had 
already been developed by November 2001, from the very beginning of the new 
mine, in order to monitor the progress of each bench of all four mines, the 
assignment of the BWEs to exploitations and benches, the rapid opening and 
development of the new Mavropigi Mine, the possibility for increased lignite 
production with fewer excavations from any exploitation, the potentiality to 
reduce expenses for contractor operations, the ensuring of the necessary period for 
the BWE extended maintenance program, etc. (Kolovos, 2004b).

The remaining volumes of overburden and lignite for every sector and every 
bench till the end of operation of the three exploitations under exhaustion had to 
be most accurately calculated. Based on the assignment of the BWEs to the 
different exploitations (or even in some cases, to other nearby mines), the mining 
capacity of the different types of BWEs, allowed a preliminary hypothesis on the 
time the BWE would have completed its remaining volumes and would be either 
available to be moved to the new mine or assigned to another operation.  
The BWEs were preferably assigned to the lignite deposit benches instead of 
the overburden ones, in order to keep production quantity and quality under strict 
control. In case a bench lacked a BWE, the respective volumes would be moved 
by contractor diesel equipment, and a provision to the mine budget and the 
relevant procedures could be made in time.  
The BWE serial number was preferred over the BWE type to appear on the 
timetable, so that it could assist the programming of the maintenance departments. 
Different colors for every BWE allowed an easy visual follow-up of each BWE’s 
movement around the different exploitations within the rolling 5-year period 
covered by the timetable. The bottom part of the timetable included a verification 
of the total number of BWEs dedicated every month to every mine, to ascertain 
that a BWE was neither omitted nor used twice. 
Priority was given to the opening of the new mine over operations in the 
existing ones, so, as soon as a bench floor was ready at the new mine, the BWE 
would be moved there, even if there was still an unexploited area at the closing 
down mine. Every time a new bench floor was prepared at the Mavropigi Mine, 
the appropriate BWE type had to crawl some kilometers to the new mine, passing 
over a small stream and both the Kozani-Ptolemais national road and railway. 
Two high voltage and one medium voltage electricity lines had to be also taken 
down every time a BWE was moved to the new mine (Fig. 6).

This procedure called for a detailed programming of the BWEs exact travelling 
dates, since many activities and departments had to coordinate. This timetable 
proved to be a most valuable tool for the mid-term production planning, as well as 
the communication with the various departments involved in the new mine project 
and the coordination of operations in all four mines/exploitations. Five different 
scenarios for the assignment of BWEs to operations and benches had already been 
produced by November 2001, allowing the respective lignite production scenarios. 
By November 2005, 6 BWEs had been deployed to the new mine and 27 different 
5-year scenarios had been produced, covering the development of the mine to the 
end of 2010.  
2.2.2 
Redesigning the Box-Cut 
The box-cut was redesigned in order to accelerate both the rapid mine opening and 
the early lignite production. The initial design aimed at preparing the ground 
surface for the control tower of the mine, the floor for the belt distribution point 
and the floor of the 1st bench (Fig. 7). The new design, (Fig. 8), altered the shape 
of the box-cut, decreasing it to the west and extending it to the north, so that the 
first bench could be assembled on the original ground topography and not within 
the box-cut, decreasing the volume of the necessary contractor works.

The narrow excavation, originally dimensioned just to host the mine 
distribution point area, was elongated to the north, allowing deeper box-cut levels 
down to the lignite deposit. The alteration to the shape and levels of the box-cut 
resulted in a lignite production of 1Mt in the very first year (2002) of the mine life 
(box-cut excavations 4.6 Mm3). The box-cut was excavated via diesel equipment 
(backhoes + loaders) and the lignite was transported by on-highway trucks to the 
nearby Ptolemais Power Plant, since neither a run-of-mine (ROM) lignite 
stockyard nor lignite conveyor belts had been prepared yet. 
The possibility for an in-pit dump does not exist in a new mine, only an ex-pit 
dump is possible during the opening phase. The ex-pit dump for the Mavropigi 
Mine was supposed to be the mining voids at the already existing exploitations 
(Northern & Komanos Fields). However, at the time the box-cut started, there was 
no available infrastructure that would permit the crossing of the Kozani-Ptolemais 
national road and railway. Mining trucks certainly cannot cross a national road 
and a new, wide enough, bridge for a road and the three stacking side conveyor 
lines was ready only two years later. As a consequence, all the soft overburden 
excavated from the box-cut was temporarily dumped nearby, in order to speed up 
the opening phase (Fig. 9).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 9 The Mavropigi Mine box-cut in 2003 
The BWEs would then be able to remove this loose overburden in small 
quantities and at a later stage. This temporary dump was also used for covering 
some streams and either levelling the topography for the bench floors or preparing 
the floors to assembly the bench side conveyor belts. Some hard formations that 
were found in the box-cut, along a fault, had to be transferred further away, at a 
small external dump outside the projected mine pit limit, near a PPC settlement. 
The BWEs were relieved from excavating hard material and this dump also 
worked as a small noise barrier, in order to protect the settlement from mine noise 
and dust.

2.2.3 
Rapid Deployment of Four BWEs 
At first, the initial box-cut was redesigned in order to accelerate the deployment of 
the first BWE. The redesigning of the initial box-cut (Fig. 8) altered the shape of 
the excavation quite enough to allow a different approach to the deployment of the 
BWEs. 
An investigation of the possibility for an early deployment of BWEs proved 
that it was possible to deploy the second BWE right after the first one, thus 
allowing significant savings in contractor works and the relevant expenditure 
(Kolovos, 2004a).  
In June 2003, the elongated and deepened box-cut, combined with the favorable 
landscape morphology, permitted the deployment of the first BWE, directly inside 
the box-cut and at the second bench, connected to conveyor belts 2-12 and one 
stacking conveyor belts line (Fig. 10).  
 
Ϯ
ϭϮ
 
Fig. 10 Belts 2-12 & 1st stacking line 
A versatile Krupp C700 was selected to be the first BWE deployed, for its very 
convenient capability of working easily at either a high or a low step. 
The key element in accelerating the opening of the mine was the ability to 
assemble the connecting conveyor bench 11, of the first bench, at the southwest 
part of the box cut, on a ramp that, due to favorable landscape morphology, could 
be easily extended outside the box-cut. The first bench, formed at the next stage, 
was divided into two segments, and a BWE was deployed to each segment. The 
two segments were developed at a later stage in the first two benches of the mine. 
This action permitted the acceleration of the overburden excavation with the 
deployment of two BWEs (Krupp SchRs 600x21/3.3) in November and December 
2003. These BWEs had separate bench side conveyor belts (named 1 & 1a - belt 
width 1200mm), but they were both connected to only one connecting conveyor 
belt (named 11 - belt width 1600mm, Fig. 11 & 12). 
The upper BWE (upper segment of the first bench) was then able to advance 
rapidly and create the necessary space for the slewing point of the mine. While the 
minimum initial assembly length of the connecting conveyor belt 12 was 178m 
(which included the 5-position shunting head, the belt tail and just two fitting 
frames), the adjacent connecting belt 11 was designed with an initial assembly 
length of 350m and could be easily lengthened by another 60m, if a piece of land 
could be expropriated: fortunately it took place with only minor delays.

The space of 172m, between the initial lengths of connecting belts 11 and 12, 
provided just enough room to deploy and operate three BWEs; their close 
proximity called for the utmost attention.

The upper BWE worked at first in parallel mode, with a shortened excavation 
side belt length (belt 1-1.0km), then in left-hand slewing mode, so that it would 
create the necessary space for the lower benches. After 4 successive elongations it 
reached a length of 2.1km. Then the slewing operation of the bench belt (belt 1) 
stopped, and it was transformed into a connecting belt, whereas a new bench belt 
(belt 1b-0.9km) was assembled, to deal with a hilly terrain. Belt 1b continued a 
counter-clockwise slewing operation until it fell into line with belt 1 and the two 
belts were joined into one, with a total length of 2.7km (Fig. 13). The upper bench 
conveyor belt gained that way its full mine length and continued the left-hand 
slewing operation. 
While the upper BWE worked with a shortened bench belt in high step, the 
second BWE, (lower segment of the first bench), had to work in low step. The 
bench belt (belt 1a) was assembled with an initial length of 0.9km, but it was 
almost immediately, in January 2004, lengthened to 1.7km by being joined with 
part of the conveyor belt of the second bench (belt 2), which was the first to be

Fig. 13 Assembly of Belt 1b, Belts 3-13 and 2nd stacking line 
assembled in June 2003. In the beginning, belt 1a followed a clockwise slewing 
operation, by transferring the belt head close to belt 1, in order to create space at 
the slewing point of the mine; after that it was soon elongated to 2.3km. With this 
operation, it soon gained the full bench length and worked mostly at the periphery 
of the mine, so that the advance between the benches would be monitored and 
kept as close as possible. The water from the small lake shown in Fig. 9 was 
pumped and the void was covered by a mix of overburden, moved by the 
contractor working at the box-cut, plus fly ash, acting as drying agent, so that the 
BWE could pass over the lake area and continue its operation beyond the lake to 
the final pit limit. 
From the beginning one stacker conveyor belt line was constructed for 
conveying the overburden, whereas the lignite conveying lines were intentionally 
delayed; priority was given to moving the overburden. This was taken into 
account when designing the floors of the upper benches, so that the BWEs met 
only minor quantities of lignite near their slewing point and it was very easy to 
dump it on the bench floor. As soon as a lignite belt line was constructed, the 
initially deployed BWE was able to deepen the mine and prepare the floor of the 
fourth bench.  
Meanwhile, the first deployed BWE at the second bench was moving 
overburden in a trench shaped excavation, to prepare the rest of the bench floor. 
Contractor works prepared the remaining part, in trench-like shaped excavations, 
so that the full bench length could be attained as soon as possible. 
The fourth bench started operations in July 2004 (Fig 13). The advance of the 
upper benches and the widening of the box-cut permitted the construction of just 
the minimum necessary length of the connecting conveyor belt 13 (178m as in belt 
12, including the 5-position shunting head, the belt tail and two fitting frames). 
The bench floor was prepared by the C700 excavator, working in low step. A 
Buchau Wölf SchRs 660x21/3 was deployed at the 3rd bench (belts 2-12) and the 
C700 was immediately moved to the fourth bench, to continue working in low 
step and deepen the mine. The Mavropigi Mine continued its development and is 
today one of the largest lignite mines in Greece (Fig. 14).

The usual case in similar worldwide BWE lignite operations is to deploy one 
BWE per year, because every BWE has to work in low step back and forth, to 
prepare the floor for the next bench. However, in the case of the Mavropigi mine, 
four BWEs were deployed in 2003-2004 within a 13-month period. This 
accomplishment was acknowledged in PPC as an international “best practice” and 
was proudly mentioned in the 2004 Annual Report (PPC SA, 2004).

Conclusions 
• 
The opening of a new mine is never a simple project: it has to be planned 
carefully and in great detail. In the case of opening a new mine with already 
existing equipment, which is not idle and ready to be used, but already 
working at other mines, the transition phase can be extremely challenging. 
• 
The role of the internal mine planning unit is indispensable in revisions and 
amendments to the long-term studies, as well as in the coordination of the 
departments responsible for the construction of the mine infrastructure. 
• 
The 5-year rolling timetable, developed for the Mavropigi case, proved to be 
a valuable tool; not only in short and mid-term production planning, but also 
in setting and rescheduling targets, in easing the communication and 
establishing a basic understanding between the mine departments and all 
external supporting units, in setting the mine budget, in programming on time 
procurements and the necessary procedures for contractor equipment 
available on time. It was a valuable mine management tool, investigating the 
best possible arrangement of the BWEs and critical in clarifying what needs 
to be done, when it needs to be done, why it needs to be done and by whom 
needs to be done. 
• 
A close co-operation of BWEs with diesel equipment is very significant for a 
fast-track preparation of bench floors.

• 
The long term mine study is indispensable in general guidance, however, 
there is always enough room for modifications, amendments and innovations 
in the short and mid-term mine planning.

Abstract. Capital mining projects are very complex due to the influence of 
various internal and external techno-economic and natural factors and constraints 
arising from social and economic environment. By investing in the development 
of surface mining the company „Rudnik i Termoelektrana Ugljevik“ („ Mine and 
Thermal Power Plant Ugljevik“) in the Republic of Srpska (Bosnia and 
Herzegovina), implements previously defined goals of growth, development 
policy and strategy of the company, as well as the national energy strategy. This 
investment project represents a capital project for the company, since it requires 
extensive financial assets, significant amount of other resources as well as time. 
The realization of the project, with regards to deposit conditions, is a very 
complex process consisting of multi-dimensional examination activities of all 
relevant determinants of future conditions and changes that the project entails. In 
addition to these internal resources, the complexity of the project realisation is 
increased by external influences of the State as the Company owner. The 
consequences of external influences to the investment project are strategic changes 
to the project scope, concept, work schedule and budget. To address the long-term 
coal supply Thermal Power Plants Ugljevik was optimised open pits Ugljevik 
basin, using modern software tools. 
This paper gives a brief overview of the methodology and results of the 
optimisation. 
Keywords: optimisation, open pit mine, efficiency and effectiveness.

Introduction 
Ugljevik coal basin is located in the north-eastern part of Republic of Srpska, and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the long-term development program of the 
coal basin, a planned successive exploitation of certain deposits has been foreseen 
for the supply of four power generating units, each providing 300 MW of power.  
The first unit was designed to be provided with coal from Bogutovo Selo coal 
deposit. The deposit contained about 50 million tons of coal reserves. The coal for 
the second unit would have been provided from the Ugljevik East (Ugljevik Istok) 

298

deposit, containing about 55 million tons of coal reserves. The coal for the third 
and the fourth unit would have been provided from other coal deposits, whose 
level of research was significantly lower in the time the long-term program was 
made, i.e. in the mid-seventies.

History of Past Activities in the Development of Thermal 
Power Complex Ugljevik 
In late seventies began the construction of the first unit of Ugljevik Thermal 
Power Plant. The unit was completed and put into operation in 1985. The 
construction of the unit 1 of the Thermal Power Plant was followed in parallel 
with the activities on preparing the open pit and of Bogutovo Selo coal deposit.  
After completion of this phase, the construction of the second unit of Thermal 
Power Plant Ugljevik began alongside with the activities on the opening and 
preparing the Ugljevik East coal deposit for exploitation.  
Complete project documentation was made for this project, defining the 
technology, external landfill sites with the required volume of storage space for 
overburden, industrial site facilities, etc. The above activities were performed 
continuously until the beginning of year 1992, when, due to well-known events, 
they were completely stopped.  
The following period was marked by efforts to resume the previously initiated 
construction. However, mostly due to lack of funds, the project was not 
implemented. Meanwhile, a reconstruction and modernization of the first unit was 
performed, thereby extending its lifetime. Additionally, a long-term loan for the 
desulphurisation project has been provided, with the last instalment of the said 
loan expiring in 2039. 
Based on studies and planning documents, while taking into consideration the 
remaining service life of Thermal Power Plant Ugljevik I, it was concluded that it 
is necessary to provide a total of about 45 million tons of coal, i.e. 1.7 million tons 
per year. Accordingly, the need arose for additional quantities of coal for the 
operation of this unit, as the available coal reserves in the coal deposit Bogutovo 
Selo, according to the remaining reserves and mining projects, enabled plant 
operation until the year 2021. 
The following figure contains a final contour of the open pit mine, Bogutovo 
Selo, 2011 mining project. 
Meanwhile, a new investor appeared with the intention to build a new unit of 
300 MW. Among other things, it was required to define a coal deposit which 
would provide sufficient quantities of coal for the new unit as well. 
In the search for optimal solutions that meet both requirements, the project 
team joined the detailed analysis of both the total mineral resources and the 
assessment of opportunities and capabilities for their exploitation.

A Brief Description of the Methodology and Results of the 
Optimisation 
The first step was the high-quality estimate of coal deposits. The estimate was 
made by applying the standards and by using a modern 3D software for this 
purpose, as well as the software for optimisation and long term mine planning and 
design. Such software allows users easier, faster and more effective approach to 
the design and production planning in comparison with traditional calculations 
that are based on numerous assumptions. 
Therefore, the first task set before the project team was to determine the final 
contours of the existing open pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo, which will provide 
the necessary amount of coal for the uninterrupted operation of Thermal Power 
Plant until the rest of its operational lifetime. Consequently, the process of 

300 
C. Stojanović  and B. Vuković
 
determining the final contours of the open pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo was 
made in two steps, as follows: 
 
Option 1 - Exploitation of the maximum possible amount of coal within 
the existing contours of the open pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo  
Option 2 -  Exploitation of the maximum possible amount of coal within 
the expansion of the open pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo onto the 
section of Ugljevik East deposit. 
 
Based on the multiple-iteration analysis, the contour of the open-pit coal deposit 
that generates the highest (discounted and undiscounted) cash flows was adopted 
as the optimal one, with predefined input optimisation parameters. Since one of 
the key parameters for optimisation is the coal price, expressed via its lower 
heating value, the base price of 2.2 € / GJ was adopted for the purpose of this 
analysis. The result of this paper is a new Contouring of the open pit coal deposit 
Bogutovo Selo, thus increasing mineable reserves from the projected 19 million 
tons to 26.5 million tons of coal.  
DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model was used to determine and optimise the 
final contour of the open pit coal deposit. Discounted cash flow analysis was 
performed with a discount rate of 10%, in order to determine the optimum limits 
of the open pit coal deposit, which will be further used for detailed design.

Table No.1 shows a portion of the cash flows (discounted and undiscounted) 
for individual contours of the mine with the corresponding quantities of coal and 
overburden and indicated an optimum open pit mine limit and optimisation 
technical parameters of the open pit mine for Option 1 is shown in Table 2. 
An optimal pit mine is the one whose contour generates the highest cash flow 
(discounted or undiscounted) with predefined input optimisation parameters. In 
this case, the approved final contour of the mine corresponds to the mine contour 
no. 17.

In order to provide the required quantity of coal for Thermal Power Plant 
Ugljevik to the end of its lifetime, year 2039., optimisation of the open pit coal 
deposit Bogutovo Selo was performed in the next step, thus expanding onto the 
open pit coal deposit Ugljevik East, with the aim of providing the lacking 
approximately cca. 20 million tons. Optimisation of Bogutovo Selo open pit coal 
deposit onto a section of the Ugljevik East deposit - Option 2 (Figure 3) was 
performed using the same methodology as in the previous version. The results of 
economic optimisation have been provided in Table 3, and the results of technical 
optimisation provided in Table 4.

Optimisation of Ugljevik Basin Open Pit Mines  
303
 
From the given analysis, it can be seen that, in this option, maximum profit is 
achieved with the exploitation of the mine deposit no.18.  The results of the 
economic optimisation show that it would be economically justified to excavate 
about 48.6 million tons of coal (mine deposit no. 45) with an average stripping 
ratio of 4.5 m3/t, meaning that such contour of the mine should provide the 
necessary amount of coal of about 45 million tonnes for a smooth and safe 
operation of the power plant by the end of its operational lifetime.

Design of Final Open-Pit Coal Deposit Contour and 
Exploitation Reserves 
The final contour of open-pit coal mine was designed based on the optimal pit 
contour (shell no. 45, Table 4) by predefining all necessary geometric elements of 
the open pit coal mine: final berm width, angles of inclination of working floors 
and final pit slope, width and longitudinal incline of roads, radius of the road 
curvature, etc. Likewise, final verification of the stability of final open-pit coal 
mine slopes was performed at this design stage, in order to provide a safe and 
secure execution of mining operations from the current state until the final open-
pit coal mine outline. After the verification of the slope stability in all directions of 
the mine, the final contour of open-pit coal mine was made, with the expansion

By comparing the coefficients of overburden from the previous project and the 
results of the optimisation described in this paper, it can be concluded that the 
average ratio of overburden until the end of the exploitation was about 4.5 m3/t for 
the open-pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo, according to the previous project 
designs, while the same ratio for the Ugljevik East was 6.5 m3/t.  
From the results of technical optimisation, it is clear that a significantly lower 
ratio of overburden was obtained for the selected final contour of the open-pit coal 
deposit Bogutovo Selo, with the expansion onto the section of open-pit coal 
deposit Ugljevik East.

The result of the analysis described is an increase of mineable reserves in the 
open pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo to about 7 million tons as a result of 
including those reserved not being included in the earlier design proposals. The 
outstanding quantities of coal required for the operation of the first unit would 
have to be provided from the open pit coal deposit Ugljevik East. Such 
development would actually represent a continuation of the exploitation from 
Bogutovo Selo deposit, thus meeting the coal needs of the first unit. 
The next step was to perform the optimisation of the remaining section of the 
open-pit coal deposit Ugljevik East in order to determine the remaining mineable 
reserves for the second unit of Thermal Power Plant Ugljevik. The optimisation 
was performed according to the same criteria as in the previous cases, with the 
analysis result amounting to approximately 40 million tons of mineable reserves. 
That way, most of the coal demand required for the operation of the new unit was 
met, provided that the missing amount of coal is provided from other deposits 
whose mining-geological conditions are somewhat less favorable for their 
exploitation. General final economic parametres of the optimisation have been 
shown in Table [5].

According to newly designed structure of the final contour of the open-pit 
coal deposit Bogutovo Selo, a remapping of concession boundaries in the coal 
basin was performed. The coal exploitation concession boundary for the open-
pit coal deposit Ugljevik Istok 1, foreseen for the use with Unit 1 of the 
Thermal Power Plant, is shown in Figure 3; As for the Figure 4, it shows the 
boundaries of the open-pit coal deposit concession for Ugljevik East 2, whose 
reserves have been provided for the requirements of the second unit of Thermal 
Power Plant Ugljevik.

Conclusion 
Advantages of the optimisation in comparison to the earlier designs: 
1. Better utilisation of deposits 
2. Balancing the overburden ratio, thus balancing operating costs 
3. Significantly reduced the amount of investment overburden

future open-pit coal deposit Ugljevik Istok is to be deposited in the 
excavated area of the open-pit coal deposit Bogutovo Selo  
5. Significantly less investment in infrastructure facilities, because of 
using the existing facilities 
6. The ability to use existing equipment without additional investment 
of purchasing new equipment in the first years of exploitation, etc.

Abstract. In fall 2011, one of the largest pit lakes of Eastern Germany was limed 
with a novel on-site process. Within 16 weeks of operation, its 110 Mm³ of water 
was shifted from the iron buffer to circumneutral pH-values. Due to a thorough 
consideration of the chemical and hydrodynamic parameters the method obtained 
80 % process efficiency. In this paper we will present the details of this novel 
UNP-process. 
1 
Introduction 
Usually, after open pit mining ceases, the residual hole is filled and a pit lake is 
created. In the Eastern German Lusatian lignite mining area, this will result in 
Europe’s largest artificial lake district. Many of these lakes comprise  large water 
volumes and surface areas and are therefore amongst the largest lakes in Germany 
(Nixdorf et al. 2001). The inflow of potentially acid groundwater from the 
adjacent overburden dumps results in sulphate dominated acidic conditions. Many 
of the newly developed pit lakes have a pH of around 3.0, in the range of the iron 
buffer (Geller et al. 1998). 
Back in the 1970s and 1980s methods were developed to treat lakes acidified 
due to acid atmospheric depositions (Nyberg 1988, Sverdrup 1985). However, the 
acidity of the acid sulphate pit lakes exceeds those of the Scandinavian softwater 
lakes by 2…3 orders of magnitude (Geller 2009). As a result a substantially larger 
amount of neutralizing agents is needed to treat the pit lakes. To minimize the 
costs for creating and keeping pH-neutral conditions it is essential to apply the 
neutralising agents as efficiently as possible. Current procedures, such as 
sprinklers (Benthaus and Weber 2012) or ships (Pust et al. 2010) that spread the 
suspension over the water surface have weaknesses that are inherent in the 
procedures and are mainly a result of the hydraulic and logistical circumstances.

This paper presents our work that aimed at developing and testing a highly 
efficient procedure to lime the pit lakes. 
2 
Methods 
Usually, lime products are used to neutralize acidified lakes. On-site they are 
mixed with water to produce a suspension which is then injected into the water 
body. To successfully inject the neutralizing agent as efficiently as possible, it is 
necessary to disperse the suspension evenly in the lake volume using a minimum 
amount of energy.  
This requirement is best met by applying the free jet principle (fig. 1). Velocity 
differences between the free jet and the ambient fluid generate exchange processes 
at the jet boundary (Schlichting and Gersten1997). Fluid particles of the ambient 
fluid near the jet boundary are incorporated into the eddies and accelerated. The 
fluid particles are decelerated within the jet as a result of turbulent conditions and 
eddies in the jet direction. Due to the incorporation of ambient fluid into the jet, 
the jet volume increases with length and the jet velocity decreases while its 
momentum stays constant. Based on the investigations of Kraatz (Bollrich et 
al.1989) it is possible to describe the jet’s velocity distribution and special 
development as a function of its initial velocity and length. 
 
Fig. 1 Velocity distribution inside a free jet flowing into a stagnant and homogenous 
surrounding fluid 
By using the free jet for injecting and mixing the lime suspension, density 
differences between the particle loaded jet beam and the ambient fluid are 
induced. Permanent mixing of the ambient fluid over the length of the jet causes a 
continuous dilution and consequently a reduction in the suspension’s density. 
Those density effects superimpose the spreading of the free jet and determine the 
beam’s trajectory (fig. 2).

The free jet’s spread is either limited by the jet reaching the lake’s floor or a 
layer of water with a higher density. Those layers might be a result of thermal 
stratification during the summer stagnation (thermocline) and the suspension will 
then spread horizontally along this boundary layer.

Fig. 2 Jet trajectory and change in density over the whole jet run length 
In order to neutralize the acid pit lake, the lime suspension’s dilution at the end 
of the jet beam’s length must possess the chemically necessary application rate. 
The best neutralisation results will be obtained if the liming is conducted during 
the lakes full vertical circulation periods as the complete length of the jet beam 
can be used for the mixing of the lime suspension (fig. 2). An adequate number of 
nozzles ensure that the ambient lake water mixed into the free jet spreads 
throughout the entire volume of the lake during the application period at least 
once. The method works on a 24-7 basis and consequently even in the case of 
large water bodies a relatively short period of time is necessary for the liming. 
Each pit has a characteristic chemical composition and morphology. 
Consequently, the UNP-process requires a configuration specifically designed for 
each water body. The parameters to be considered include the maximum 
concentration of the lime suspension, the best treatment period and the location of 
the nozzles to produce the free jet.

Area of Investigation 
A first pilot test of the UNP liming process was conducted in the waters of the pit 
lake Scheibe, which has a volume of 110 Mm³ and a water surface of 6.8 Mm2. 
With its length of 5.2 km and a maximum width of 1.7 km it is one of the largest 
pit lakes in the Lusatian lignite mining area. As a result of the lignite mining 
technology used, the lake’s morphology is characterised by two distinct features: 
the eastern part of the lake consists of the former pit’s inner dump with a shallow 

312

water area of 2…6 m depth and the western part with a water depth of 35 m  
(fig. 3). Lake Scheibe is characterised by dimictic conditions with full circulation 
phases in spring and fall.  
A determining aspect for the water composition of lake Scheibe are the ground 
water inflows into the lake: from the south, from the mother rock a slightly acidic 
ground water with an acidity of approximately 1.0 mmol/L and from the inner 
dump water with an acidity of 9.0 mmol/L. 
The initial state determined of the lake Scheibe´s water to be treated was an 
acidity of 3.4 mmol/L, a pH of 2,9, as well as calcium and sulphate concentrations 
of 150 mg/L and 550 mg/L, respectively.

Pilot Project Implementation 
Prior to the pilot test, various potential lime products were investigated in the 
laboratory to determine if they can be used to neutralize Lake Scheibe with the 
UNP-process. The quicklime (CaO) provided by Fels-Werke GmbH proved to 
possess the best application properties with a application rate necessary 
determined of 150 g/m³ at an efficiency of 70 %.  Consequently the necessary 
amount of lime to be added was 16.5 kt. 
Technologically, the UNP-process has been kept simple: A submersible pump 
draws water from the lake and supplies the mixing station with this water by ways 
of a pipe. Two lime silos dose the neutralization agent into a mixing tank. From 
there, the lime suspension is pumped into a maturation tank and finally into a 
submerged floating pipe transporting the suspension into the lake. At the end of 
the pipe the lime suspension mixing nozzles are installed in pairs. Lake Scheibe 
had a nozzle configuration with 6 pairs at a distance of 20 m, which can be 
considered to be a punctiform injection in relation to the lake’s size (fig. 3). On

October 4, 2011 the treatment of Lake Scheibe started and was successfully 
completed on January 25, 2012, after just 16 weeks of operation and two short 
operational interruptions of the liming installation (fig. 4). For monitoring the 
liming, 33 water samples were taken on a weekly basis at 12 sampling locations 
(fig. 3).  
Based on the changes of the water quality, the specifications for the further 
operation of the neutralisation plant were determined. An additional monitoring of 
the hydraulic conditions of the lake provided the basis for validating a 3D lake 
model (MOHID-Water Modelling System). Both data were used to verify the 
design calculation algorithms previously used. In addition, the aim of the 3D 
modelling was to identify the fraction of the momentum input, density driven 
flow, and wind induced flow responsible for the overall water treatment. 
5 
Results 
At the beginning of the treatment, Lake Scheibe was characterised by stratification 
with the thermocline being located at a depth of 12 m. Liming started initially with 
a 10.4 t/h mass flow, equivalent to 250 t/d. Such an application rate makes high 
demands on the logistics of the lime supply as up to 10 silo trucks were needed 
daily. As expected, the application of the suspension was restricted to the 
epilimnion, but wind induced currents during this phase of the injection assisted in 
the uniform distribution of the concentrations throughout the whole epilimnion. 
Consequently, a treatment effect could already be observed at the two farthest 
measurement points E1 and E2 in the first week of operation (fig. 3). 
A certain proportion of the neutralising agent is stored as a result of its 
horizontal spreading along the thermocline. Since the samples were always taken 
from the same depths, part of the injected neutralisation agent is therefore not 
detected and thus, the average effect in the entire lake is temporarily 
underestimated. In view of a full lake circulation and the subsequent 
homogenisation of the lake’s conditions the treatment effect is eventually correctly 
represented. 
During the continuation of the water treatment, the thermocline gradually 
disappeared and the effect of the treatment could fully develop over the entire 
water depth. This phase of the treatment is purely controlled by momentum input 
and the density driven flow in the lake.  
Figure 4 shows the temporal development of the average lake’s conditions. As 
a measure of the acidity and alkalinity the modified neutralization potential NP of 
Schöpke (2008) is used.  
As planned, at the end of the water treatment, Lake Scheibe exhibited pH-
neutral conditions with a 0.16 mmol/L buffering capacity. The amount of lime 
used was 15.2 kt, which is less than calculated and the chemical efficiency of 80 
% was above the pre-determined value. All project objectives agreed to with the 
client were met and the financial framework was not exhausted. With treatment

costs of less than 0.01 €/mol the UNP-process is well below other lake treatment 
costs with lime. 
Various boundary conditions for the lake treatment could be identified by the 
3D modelling. Wind induced currents are supportive only within the epilimnion. 
Yet, the main treatment effect is controlled by the momentum input and the 
density driven flow (fig. 5). Moreover, the pre-determined parameters for 
predicting the process could be proved to be sufficiently accurate.

acid inflow of 27.1 Mio. mol/a with a follow up neutralization after one year with 
an introduction of  approx. 1,000 t  quicklime. Adding CO2 leads to a hydrogen 
carbonization creating a buffer and significantly lengthening the time required 
before aftercare treatment is necessary.  
Calculations were made based on the UNP pilot test of Lake Scheibe and 
discussed with the client. As a result aftercare follow up treatment is planned for 
the spring circulation phase of the lake waters March/April 2014. Thereafter hydro 
carbonization will be carried out of the lake with the addition of pulverized 
limestone and CO2 simultaneously. The UNP process is technically suitable for 
this and as in the primary and first aftercare neutralization its reliability and 
economical benefits have been demonstrated. 
The installation will be assembled as follows: For liming the UNP equipment 
remains unchanged as described. The gaseous CO2 will be dissolved in a reactor 
on land. The dissolved CO2 will be also introduced using the equivalent technical 
installation. The underwater nozzle pipelines with its nozzles will be placed  
approx 1 m above the bottom of the lake at its deepest point, >30m deep. In 
contrast to the primary neutralization, the CO2 and lime will be introduced in the 
summer stagnation period. The underlying idea of the procedure is to use the 
entire body of water for the reaction. During the introduction phase the lime 
suspension is self-distributing in epilimnion, the dissolved CO2 in hypolimnion. 
While the lime particles gradually sink they dissolve and have a hydrogen 
carbonate buffering effect first in hypolimnion. In autumn with the dissolution of 
thermal stratification both water bodies mix and lead to a buffering of the entire 
lake. 9,600 t pulverized limestone and 7.500 t CO2 are intended for alkalinization. 
There will be a total application period of 16 weeks with a 6 week starting 
preparation time introducing CO2 alone and then the remaining CO2 and 
pulverized limestone are added simultaneously.  According to the calculations the 
intervals between necessary follow up aftercare will increase to > 6 years at costs 
calculated as significantly under other procedures.

The Effect of Liming on the Downstream Ground Water 
Quality 
The lake waters predominantly infiltrate the grounds on the northern side. The 
aquifer investigated is of sands and the permeability is 6.0*10-4 m/s. The 155 m 
distance from the shores of the Lake Scheibe to the ground water measuring point 
6048 has a calculated flow time of 0.5 years. The local geological conditions were 
described in detail by Preuß and Koch in 2013. 
Although a very rapid neutralization and the complete deferrization of Lake 
Scheibe took place –there was a substantial delay before the change in the water 
quality was detected (fig. 6). A clear decrease in acidity was first observed 1.5 
years after the liming of the lake (three times the theoretical flow time). With the 
transformation of oxic lake water to anoxic ground water significant amounts of 

316

ferric ions are mobilized. Prior to liming  the lake the groundwater had an iron 
content of approx. 70mg/l, more than double than the lake water approx. 28mg/l. 
Although at the ground water measuring point there was a significant decrease in 
iron content, the concentrations of 35mg/l were higher than any of those measured 
in the lake water prior to neutralization. (fig. 6 right) 
Despite a slight re-acidification of the lake waters the dissolved iron content 
remains under 1 mg/l two years after liming was carried out.

Conclusions 
As the LMBV pilot test for neutralising Lake Scheibe showed, a stationary, 
continuously working liming installation can treat large pit lakes within a 
relatively short period of time. The UNP-process described in this paper combines 
chemical and hydrodynamic conditions within its design calculation algorithm. In 
order to achieve an optimum treatment, the process is fitted into the natural 
circulation period of the water body. To our knowledge this was the first time that 
15.2 kt of limestone were applied within a 16 weeks operation period. The 
chemical efficiency of 80 % exceeds the expected efficiency obtained during 
preliminary tests and the treatment costs of less than 0.01 €/mol extraordinarily 
prove that the UNP-process is a highly efficient treatment option.

Analysis of Sound Emissions in the Pit  
and Quarry Industry

Introduction 
The awareness of the population of harmful influences in their environment is 
increasing and the operations of the pit and quarry industry are coming to the fore 
of public interest. They are often discussed with regard to sound emissions, which 
arise from the mining, transport, processing and loading of the materials to  
excavate. 
The goal of this analysis was to find out by way of two pit and quarry opera-
tions what the emissions are due to the operation and how they are to be evaluated 
on the basis of legal guide values and psychological threshold values.  
The measurements were made during operational hours as well as non-
operational hours so as to ascertain to what extent the operation is responsible for 
sound emissions. 
In order to obtain an overview of the propagation of the emissions punctually 
measured results have been interpolated to the whole plant premises and adjacent 
areas. From these measurements sound maps have been generated making the 
special distribution of the emission values visible and forming a basis for the eval-
uation of the emission behavior of the plant. 
The measurements cover a total period of about 150 hours. By saving the mea-
surement values by the second, 540.000 measuring values were available for the 
propagation calculation.

What Is Sound 
The human ear perceives sound at any time; unlike the eye it does not have the 
ability to close itself in order to so prevent the intake of sounds. 
The ear takes in the sound which is processed in the brain as a sensatory  
stimulus. Only then, any person decides whether it is perceived as pleasant or 
unpleasant. 
If the sound perceived and processed is considered unpleasant it is generally 
called noise. According to this definition sound is a subjective matter.

Sound that is perceived as pleasant can also be noise in the sense of legal regu-
lations and provisions if it exceeds levels that are hazardous to health. The table 
below provides these levels.

Psychological reactions, e.g.high blood pressure, increased heart frequency

Sound is measured in Decibel (dB). 
“Decibel denotes the measured sound pressure i.e. the sound output per area. 
To express the measured values in simple figures the decibel scale is logarithmic 
so that a difference of a few decibel can account for an over-proportional differ-
ence in sound intensity.” [1] 
In view of its effect on humans sound is usually measured in dB(A). This 
means that the characteristics of the human ear considered in sound measuring. As 
humans are significantly less sensitive for deep frequencies filters are used for the 
dB(A) measurement that attenuate these frequencies.  
However, the difficulty remains that the dB values are abstract values that are 
difficult to interpret without reference values (see table 2).

Regulatory Legal Provisions 
The determination of admissible emissions that may emanate from industrial oper-
ations or other technical installations and also the immissions to be measured at an

immission point is regulated in Germany by the “Law on the protection from ha-
zardous environmental effects by air pollution, noises, vibrations or similar activi-
ties (Federal Immission Protection Law) 
This law prescribes that installations that due to their characteristics or opera-
tion are especially suitable to cause hazardous environmental effects require a 
special immission law approval, next to construction-law approval [2] 
Even if an installation does not require approval it must nonetheless be operat-
ed in the way that all hazardous effects on the environment are avoided according 
to the state of the art. 
The measurements and the evaluation of the sound emissions of industrial  
installations are effected according to the German guidelines of „Technical in-
structions for noise protection“ (TI-Noise). The TI-Noise is the “Sixth General 
Administrative Rule of the Federal Immission Law (Technical instructions for 
noise protection). 
Its purpose is to protect the general public and the neighborhood from hazard-
ous environmental effects by noise as well as the prevention of hazardous envi-
ronmental effects by noise. It applies for installations that require approval and are 
subject to the second part of the Federal Immission Protection Law...“ [3] 
The TI-Noise stipulates the immission target values. They indicate what noise 
immissions are allowed in different areas. These immission target values have 
been used in the sound maps. 
The adherence to these values needs to be checked by the responsible state en-
vironmental agencies unless the installations are subject to mining law.

Measurements in the Gravel Pit 
The examined pit produces 750.000 tons of gravel and sand per year using wheel 
loaders and conveyor belts.  
The measuring points are located within the boundaries at significant points of 
emission generation and are further distributed around the gravel quarry. Within 
the quarry the measurements were carried out at nine points and outside the plant 
at six points. The location of the measurement points can be seen in figure 1. 
At all measuring points non-operational and operational measurements were 
carried out. That was not possible at all points due to operations. In the case of the 
non-operational measurements outside the plant it has to be pointed out that the 
traffic was much lower during non-operational hours than at operational hours. 
Therefore, it can be assumed that the measurements do not give a true picture of 
the non-operational volume towards the bottom end. 

322

Fig. 1 Overview of the measuring area  
The map displayed in figure 2 shows the distribution of the expected exposure 
approximately calculated with ArcGIS (Spline with Barriers) during the opera-
tional hours of the gravel plant. The boundaries of the individual zones were 
drawn according to the Immission guide values indicated in the TI-Noise as listed 
in the legend to figure 2. As there are emissions inside the plant too, which are 
above the values allowed for industrial zones and which are not defined as a class 
in its own right two more areas were added to this classification, one range be-
tween 70 dB(A) und 75 dB(A) and an another between 75 dB(A) and 80 dB(A). 
These two additional zones of 5 dB(A) steadily prolong the scale upward. 
The map suggests that outside the boundaries of the plant no high immission 
values occur caused by its operation. The maximum values to be expected based 
on the calculations occur in two short boundary areas in the north- west and west 
of the premises, which are admissible for mixed zones. In the larger part of the 
direct surroundings of the plant the values are admissible for general, in most

cases even all-residential areas. Further outside, the effect of the noise level gener-
ated by the gravel plant naturally wanes. The calculations here only resulted in 
values that are admissible for spa areas. 
Here, it becomes very evident that the immissions to be expected outside the 
plant and caused by it are so low that a lasting impairment of the quality of living 
conditions can basically be excluded. 
 
Fig. 2 Sound map of operational hours in the gravel pit  
Inside the plant the highest strains to be expected are above the maximum val-
ues of 65 dB(A) are admissible for the industry These values may arise near the 
processing plant as well as at the installations near the conveyor belt. The values 
calculated in this area are in almost all cases still below 75 dB(A), only directly at 
the processing plant values of up to 80 dB(A) were measured. So they are still 
below the threshold of 85 dB(A) that is hazardous to human hearing. The load on 
the staff can be considered as low as the personnel do not stay in the open (pro-
duction area) during normal operations. In these areas vehicles are used for work 
where the drivers stay in closed cabins. It can be assumed that the cabins lower the 
sound from outside to non-critical levels.  
What is more, there are large noise exposures in the area near the scales. Since 
the staff here are in a closed building health risks can be widely excluded.  
Figure 3 displays the calculated sound propagation during non-operational 
hours for comparison.

The bottom line is that while there is nuisance caused by the operation of the 
plant in the areas directly adjacent to the plant it is on a low level. These findings, 
however, can only be transferred to other plants within limits because there are 
many factors of influence in sound propagation. So, nuisance on residents would 
also be possible in the case of this plant caused by an unfavorable wind direction 
from the south-east. The main wind direction at the location of the gravel quarry, 
however, is south-west and so a permanent change of the immission situation by 
wind can be ruled out.

Measurements Inside the Quarry 
The plant produces basalt on a total of five levels using drillings and blasting, 
where only one is in operation at a single time. The loading is effected by a back-
hoe onto a heavy-duty truck taking over the transport. The plant has a yearly out-
put of 200.000t of material. 
Figure 4 shows the area of the quarry with different production areas and the 
positioning of the measuring points. The plant is located directly next to a federal 
highway. 
In this plant too measurements were carried out inside the plant and at its boun-
daries. 
 

Analysis of Sound Emissions in the Pit and Quarry Industry

Fig. 4 Overview, quarry 
In this plant, too, measurements were carried out during operational and non-
operational hours.  
The map displayed in figure 5 shows the distribution of the nuisance to be ex-
pected approximately calculated with ArcGIS during the operational hours of the 
quarry. The separation of the individual areas was done according to the immis-
sion values of the TI-Noise. Unlike the gravel plant, the presentation of the sound 
emissions in this map the scale had to be completed towards the top by four more 
ranges. In addition to the sound map regarding the gravel plant the categories 
between 80 dB(A) and 85 dB(A) as well as over 85 dB(A) were added. Concern-
ing the category above 85 dB(A) it has to be underlined that this value may lead to 
non-reversible hearing impairments when humans are permanently exposed to 
it.[see table 1]. The numbers displayed in the marked-up areas are to be regarded 
as dB(A) maximum values. 
In analysing the map it becomes evident that the highest emission values are 
measured in the zone around the processing unit. The values are partly above the 
range of 85 dB(A), which is hazardous in the case of permanent exposure. As can 
be seen from the map the value rapidly decrease as the distance from the plant 
decreases, yet this does not mean, however, that this is also the case in reality.  
Here, a difficulty in drawing up the maps comes into play. The interpolation 
was calculated and regarded in 2-D, any barrier of sound propagation thus seems 
to be the same. In the case of a 3-D modelling that would take into account the 
actual height of the barriers themselves and their spatial position to the emission 
source, we could assume that the high values in the northern direction would not 
decrease so rapidly. The digital terrain model of the plant premises necessary to 
this end was not available. 

326

Since there are no residents in the near vicinity of the plant any conflict over 
the emission peaks can be largely excluded. Nonetheless, this aspect should be 
taken into account in view of a transfer of the measuring results to other plants or 
the planning of other measuring campaigns.  
In the mining area located in the eastern part of the premises the low calculated 
average values make for the fact that it hardly plays a role in the total average 
exposure. So, the mining area is always within one range admissible for residential 
areas. Towards the east it even fades into a range admissible for residential areas, 
further east even spa areas would be allowed. On the whole, the highest values 
that go beyond the boundaries of the plant are in a range admissible for the indus-
try and rapidly decrease to a level admissible for mixed-use zones. If there are any 
problem zones regarding emissions leaking outside then they are towards the di-
rection of the highway in the south of the premises. In this direction the calculated 
emission values are relatively high; they are in the value range of mixed-use 
zones. 
To evaluate the exposure of staff inside the plant two areas mining and 
processing have to differentiated. In the mining zone their exposure is relatively 
low on average with values below 60 dB(A). They are thus in a range that can be 
called hazard-free according to table 1. There is only a problem regarding the 

Analysis of Sound Emissions in the Pit and Quarry Industry 
327
 
maximum levels. Since the workers are either in the excavator or truck cabins 
during mining dangerous exposure can be widely excluded.  
In the area near the processing plant significantly higher values are obtained on 
average, which may lead to hearing impairments during extended exposure. As no 
staff member stays in the open in this area for a longer time hazardous exposure 
cannot be fully ruled out but it is relatively unlikely. However, it is preferable that 
these levels are lowered in the area. 
Figure 6 in turn shows a sound map during non-operational hours for  
comparison.

Summary 
The studies conducted in the two operations proved considerable sound immis-
sions outside the premises, especially true for the quarry. But already in a distance 
of 200 m the immissions decrease to a level which is acceptable for mixed-use 
zones. Main sound emitters in open pit operations are processing plants and load-
ing terminals. Sound emissions of more than 85 dB(A) have been measured close 
to these facilities inside the quarry. Extended exposure to this sound level can lead 

328 
A. Hennig and C. Biermann 
 
to non-reversible hearing impairments. Hence hearing protection is required in 
these areas. 
Relatively low sound levels are emitted at the loading point and by transport 
operation. Exceptions are blasting operations. Sound levels of more than 115 
dB(A) occur. A specific measurement of sound emissions caused by blasting op-
erations was not part of this project. 
On one hand the results found cannot be directly transferred to other projects or 
operations as the sound transmission is directly linked to the specific site. On the 
other hand the effort for these measurements is rather small, as the measurements 
only have to be done during operational hours. At critical locations (close to set-
tlements) a monitoring program is recommended. With the results generated by a 
computer based calculation critical areas can be identified and certain measures 
for noise reduction can be derived. 
In addition to the data already gathered further acoustic measurements of single 
processing units, loading terminals and mobile equipment will be done at other 
quarries in the future. This set of data will allow computer based calculations for 
any terrain, presuming that a digital terrain model is available. Hence forecasts of 
acoustic emissions for green-field projects or project expansions will be possible 
and can be taken into account for planning purposes.

Abstract. The densely populated Central German region in the south of Berlin is 
rich in lignite. In addition to an energetic use of the lignite, the material use of 
lignite will become more important in the future. Due to the annual excavation of 
1 billion m³ of sediments, valuable land will be lost. Therefore, it is important to 
use edited dumps for the generation of reclamation areas. These dumps should 
have good geotechnical as well as geochemical conditions, considering the 
surrounding waters and to protect the receiving waters. Unfortunately, the 
overburden above the coal includes pyrite, which causes problems such as 
groundwater acidification and the discharge of sulphate, iron and trace metals. As 
the groundwater level in the future tipping of the open pits will rerise, it is 
important to control the influence of weathering of pyrite depositions (acid mine 
drainage), buffering by glacial till and the resulting solutes on the surrounding 
water body. By superposing geochemistry and geology it is possible to mark main 
problem areas, improve buffer potentials by changing the technology and 
implement suitable technological countermeasures. Therefore a short method by 
using a portable XRF-analysis will be helpful to determine buffering and 
acidifying potentials. In the future, this will significantly reduce the impact to the 
surrounding waters by material loads from the dump bodies. The optimal use of 
the existing buffering potentials can save a large amount of money, that otherwise 
would be necessary for the subsequent rehabilitation.

Introduction and Objectives 
In the area of lignite mining there are geological units which contain pyrite (FeS2). 
So open-cast lignite mining induces sulphide weathering connected with Acid-
Mine-Drainage-phenomena and the mobilisation of acidity, sulphate and cat ion 
metals (Wisotzky 1994). This partial weathering of sulphides is embedded in 
hydro-geochemical buffering reactions. Essential buffers are carbonates, 
aluminium or iron hydroxides and aluminium silicates. Especially the carbonate 
buffering is important (Hoth 2004). For sustainable strategic activities to reduce 
the acidification of groundwater around the lignite dumpsites of Peres, 
Schleenhain und Profen (Germany, South of Leipzig/Saxony), it is necessary to 
evaluate the acidification and buffer potentials of the overburden units. These 
investigations need to consider the applied mining technology and mass 
management (Rascher 2010).  
For a sustainable development of strategic measures to avoid or reduce the 
acidification of groundwater in the surroundings of lignite mining, the evaluation 
of the natural geogenic potential in relation to the proposed mining technology is 
an essential issue. 
A complete avoidance of the acidity generated through mining operations is 
impossible up to now. It is rather a question of minimising the negative effects by 
applying appropriate technology from the initial mine development to the final 
reclamation. Regarding this, primary, secondary and tertiary technical measures 
can be distinguished (Drebenstedt, Struzina 2008). 
The first intention of the research was, to identify technological reduction 
measures to minimise groundwater acidification based on the hydrochemical 
situation within the mining field and by taking the mining technology into 
account. For this a complex system of research methods has been developed and 
will described below. 
Because of the complex and long-term processing of the samples in the 
laboratory, it is beneficial to develop a short method to characterize the future 
overburden cheaper and quicker. So in operation, it will be possible to tilt the 
upcoming overburden in a structured and documented system. 
In the context of the preparatory work on the project "ibi" (inovative lignite 
integration) at the Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg (Pfütze, 
Drebenstedt 2012) and the purchase of a handheld XRF-sensor in the ibi-project, 
the idea was born to develop a short method for the detection of acidifying and 
buffering sediments in mid German lignite mining. Furthermore, it is required to 
distinguish the overburden and valuable materials. 
2 
Solution of the Tasks 
To solve the acidification problem a working scheme was created (Simon 2013). 
This includes three sections the geological model, the geochemical model and the 

Short Method for Detection of Acidfying and Buffering Sediments

technological production model. Each of these sections has been investigated with 
different processing methods. These methods will be explained in more detailed in 
the following. Figure 1 shows the basic concept and processing scheme of the 
investigations. The laboratory and field work is of particular importance for the 
processing (Simon 2012). Especially on-site eluates, weathering tests and 
buffering tests are useful and will described in these items.  
 
Fig. 1 Basic concept and processing scheme of investigation 
2.1 
On-site Eluates 
The experiments for the determination of geogenic acidification and buffering 
potentials were carried out with the aim of identifying weathering-relevant units 
and relevant carbonate buffer potentials for the overburden profile. On-site eluates 
are a quick method to detect problematic material and buffer material. The 
sediments of the core boxes from the dry drilling were eluted and pH-value and 
electrical conductivity were measured. For elution, 10 mL of sediment and 25 mL 
of deionised water were mixed. pH-value and conductivity were measured by 
portable multi-parameter instruments (for example WTW 3430). 
After that, the values could plotted depth-oriented. Test shows clearly low pH-
values and higher conductivities in aquifer 2 and 3 sediments. In contrast, glacial 
till shows high pH-values and low electrical conductivities.

bottle. It was loaded with 100 mL of a 0.1 molar calcium acetate solution and 
shaken for 1 hour in an overhead shaker. A centrifuge separation of the solids 
followed. If necessary, an additional filtration step was carried out on 0.45µm. 
After this, the solution was titrated with 0.1 M NaOH solution to a pH of 8.2 the 
end point of phenolphthalein. For a correct calculation the results were normalised 
by a blank value and water content to mmol/100g dry matter. 
CS-Mat-analysis was used to determine the solids content of carbon and 
sulphur. The samples were sieved about a size cut out of 2 mm and freeze-dried. 
The fine material was ground by a ball mill and then finely powdered fed to the 
analysis. To determine the respective mass fractions of the investigated carbon and 
sulphur species a back-calculation was performed for the screening, in order to 
make statements for the entire geologic unit. Using CS-Mat, the carbon content in 
the form of total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic carbon (TIC) was achieved. 
It is possible to distinguish between amorphous and easily available sulfur 
fractions as well. 
As part of the characterisation of the weathering accessibility of the liners the 
grain size distribution was determined. These units, after drying and sonication 
in the sieve stack of sieves with mesh sizes 20 mm, 6.3 mm, 2 mm, 0.63 mm, 0.2 
mm, 0.063 and 0.02 mm were separated according to the particle size. 
Another important method is the determination of the water content. By 
weighing the mass of test sediment before and after drying at 105°C, the water 
content can be calculated. 
2.3 
Weathering Tests 
Weathering tests were performed to characterize the accessibility and weathering 
potentials for the major geological units. After the geochemical characterisation 
the samples were stored in photo bowls and were exposed to weathering by 
atmospheric oxygen. For this purpose, the samples were moistened and turned at 
intervals. The investigated sediments were stored at a constant temperature of 
about 10°C (mean soil temperature around Leipzig) in the refrigerator. 
There was a sampling of the weathering material after approximately 0, 7, 21, 
49, 105, 210 and 500 days. In addition to the hydrolytic acidity a geochemical 
characterisation of the weathered sediments using two different eluates with 
differing solid-water ratios was carried out. The eluates having a solid water ratio 
of 1 to 2.5 and 1 to 25 have been shaken by means of the overhead shaker for one 
hour. Subsequently, the eluates were treated in the centrifuge to separate solid 
from the liquid. For further analysis the eluate samples were resolved with SCFA-
0, 45μm syringe filter. Photometrically the contents of iron, iron (II) and sulphate 
were measured and the pH-values and conductivities were determined.

2.4 
Buffering Tests 
With the initial results of the weathering experiments and blending those with the 
proposed mining technology in the future construction mining fields, the actual 
procedure has been derived and implemented to the buffering tests. The aim was 
to investigate the reduction of the acidification by adding the buffering glacial till 
(carbonate buffer) to Tertiary material. The experiments especially focused on the 
main acidity-relevant aquifers 2 and 3. Buffering tests were performed after 
mixing the units in analogy to the weathering tests. Hydrolytic acidity and the 
parameters pH-value, conductivity and iron release and sulfate release of the 
eluate 1:2.5 were measured from each single test mixture from the photo bowls. 
For the recalculation of the values on the dry matter the water content was 
determined. 
For buffering tests of the Aquifer 2 and Aquifer 3 sediments of the mining field 
Schleenhain and Peres, five individual approaches with differing mixing ratios of 
tills and acidic sediments were created (0% to 100%, 10% to 90%, 20% to 80%,  
40% to 60% and 100% to 0%). The first and last single test represents the pure, 
unmixed materials. To obtain enough sample volume of glacial till and aquifer 
material, relevant, preserved (frozen) samples were combined to composite 
samples.

Short Method by Portable XRF-Sensor? 
In the context of research studies, a portable Niton XL3t XRF-sensor could be 
purchased (Fig. 2). This portable X-ray fluorescence sensor system could be used 
in recycling, quality assurance, material identification, precious metal analysis, 
environmental, chemical, and many other applications. The analyzers of “XL3 
classic series” are versatile, portable XRF instruments for fast element analysis 
within a few seconds.

The main advantages of these devices are program modules for many 
applications as well as individual calibrations which are possible. In our case the 
pre-installed "Mining Mode" was used. Elements measured in the "Mining mode" 
are exposed colorly in Figure 3. All other items are specified as "balance" and 
mainly contain hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. 
The XRF-measurement was performed on dried samples, ground in an agate 
mortar. Then the measured values were sorted and plotted stratigraphically. The 
results are shown in Figure 4. 
 
Fig. 3 via XRF un- (gray) and detectable (colored) elements 
Looking at the results of the XRF-measurement, geological units can be summed 
up chemically, due to the distribution of the elements silicon, aluminum, sulfur and 
calcium, as well as the residual “balance”. In Tab. 1 the results are plotted. 
Because carbon is the main component of coal, the "balance" is significantly 
higher (85 to 95 Mass-%) than in non-cohesive and cohesive sediments. So 
overburden and raw materials can be distinguished very easily. Even a distinction 
of different qualities of coal is quite possible by XRF. Especially suitable for 
distinguishing are the elements calcium, sulfur, iron, titanium and silicon. 
All sediments have high aluminum and silicon levels. These characterize the 
overburden matrix. By means of the calcium amount the glacial till can be 
detected, because the carbonate is present as CaCO3. In the sediment calcium can 
also be detected outside the glacial till, but in a much smaller level, for example as 
gypsum. 0.3 percent by mass have been determined as a distinctive criterion. This 
way, the buffer material can be determined. 
The other sediments need to be differentiated in the terms of acidification 
tendency. As prior knowledge from previous studies for lignite mining, a division 
in three sediment classes is sufficient. Due to the sulfur content of the residual, 
sediments can be divided in non-acidifying, low-acidifying and acidifying 
sediments. As separation limits 0.3 and 1.5 mass percent were selected. These are

By means of a XRF sensor it is simple to distinguish the upcoming overburden 
and lignite in mining. Due to the preliminary tests, a type of calibration can be 
performed with abstracted values of acidification and buffering.  
Perhaps in the near future this geological and chemical examination of 
sediments can help to invent or manufacture sensors for the excavator or conveyor 
belt that allow operating improvements. However, this will be the task of other 
working groups. 
4 
Results, Conclusions and Implementation 
By superposing the results of different methods of XRF-analysis, as well as 
geotechnical, geochemical and geological investigations, it is possible to identify 
main problem areas and implement suitable technological counter-measures. 
Therefore the knowledge, of the layer thickness ratios or cubature of substantial 
overburden units is essential.  
Figure 5 shows the different ways or methods to solve the task. Basic 
preliminary work is necessary to install a short method successfully. This requires 
a gauging of the XRF method. This system can be practicable, shown by the 
activities of RWE AG in the Rhenish lignite mining area. 
As another result of the research, a new dump structure was created (Simon 
2013). Rather than in conical strips, the overburden is now dumped in fine layers, 
so that a large contact area between the substratess and the problematic aquifers is

created. Figure 6 shows the dumpsite of the open cast Schleenhain. On the right 
side it’s possible to see the old unstructured dump area. On the left is the new

The combination of the results of XRF-analysis, buffering tests and  geological 
model allows efficient mixing of rare buffering material to achieve a good 
geochemical compositions and neutral pH values in the dump body.  
Thus, it is possible to save the cost-intensive admixing of buffer materials such 
as lime or dolomite. The realization of the technology transition requires no 
additional major equipment. The implementation can be done with the present 
excavators, conveyors, conveyor switches and spreaders. However, a qualified 
technological control of mining, transport and deposit is necessary.

Introduction 
RWE Power AG operates three large-scale opencast mines in the Rhenish lignite 
mining area with an output of about 100 million tons per year to supply the 
Company-owned lignite-fired power plants and refining factories (see Fig. 1). 
Some 450 million cubic metres of overburden must be moved each year to expose 
the lignite.

The development and operation of the opencast mines are determined by a 
multitude of "external" and "internal" factors, which will continue to increase in 
number both today and in future – not least due to the transformation in energy 
systems. Market orientation and the resulting demand for flexibility as well as 
energy-efficient business processes play a significant role in this regard. The 
complex interplay of the associated processes calls for carefully coordinated 
planning, scheduling and execution. Here, the operating team is supported by 
advanced IT and PDP systems, which can be adjusted to match the growing 
challenges. 
2 
Challenges Posed to Operations Management in the 
Opencast Mines 
The development and the operation of an opencast mine are determined both by 
"external" factors such as power plants, factories, the environment, the 
neighbourhood, policy-makers and society and by "internal" factors such as 
geology, opencast mine technology, opencast mine planning and bunker 
management. 
Some of these factors are becoming more influential, among other things, due 
to the transformation in energy systems (see Fig. 2). To meet these challenges, 
mining processes need to be optimised and must become more flexible, and 
further cost-cutting potential must be tapped. 
  
Fig. 2 Challenges posed to operations management 
 

Market-Oriented, Flexible and Energy-Efficient Operations Management 
341
 
 
Several examples of the increasing challenges are presented below: 
2.1 
Increase in Flexibility 
Owing to the volatile generation from renewable energy, the demand for lignite is 
subjected to ever greater fluctuations as lignite-fired power plants are 
redispatched, e.g. when the feed-in from wind power plants is high and at the 
same time electricity needs are low.  
For operations management, the need for greater flexibility means: 
- Short response times  
- Assessment of response action with a view to its impact on other processes 
  and on planning horizons 
- Inclusion of personnel deployment planning in mining and downtime planning 
2.2 
Energy Management, Energy Efficiency 
Following the introduction and certification of the energy management system 
according to DIN 50001 for RWE Power AG's opencast mines, the future will be 
all about implementing measures that reduce energy consumption in the long term 
and make the success measurable. For mining-related operations management this 
means that the power demand of large-scale consumers, particularly of the belt 
conveyors, must be considered as a further criterion when deciding on planning 
and scheduling options. This criterion will rely on the continuous measurement of 
energy performance indicators. 
2.3 
Environmental-Protection Requirements and Coal Quality 
From 2014 on, the power stations need to comply with even stricter sulphur limits 
for flue gas. In the opencast mines, by contrast, the mean sulphur content will rise 
in the years to come, with significant differences on the individual coal benches. 
For the operations management of the opencast mines along the North-South 
railway line it is therefore important that the equipment deployment areas are 
coordinated in detail and with foresight across all opencast mines, with due regard 
to the blending rules for the specific power-plant units.  
2.4 
Mixed Soils 
The extraction of overburden is increasingly facing drops in output due to difficult 
mining materials, so-called mixed soils (M2). They have a high share of cohesive 
components and are difficult to drain. The fact that only a limited quantity of these 
unstable mixed soils can be placed results in downtimes and bottlenecks in the 
placement process on the dumping side. Figure 3 shows one example of the 

342 
D. Gärtner, R. Hempel, and H. Rosenberg
 
 
imbalance between M2 supply and placement options. To deal with this imbalance 
and to ensure safe dump slopes, pinpointed and far-sighted operations 
management is required. 
 
Fig. 3 Comparison of M2 supply and placement options 
2.5 
Retirement of Experienced Staff Members 
In the years to come, operations will be more and more forced to do without 
experienced staff members (on age grounds), with requirements increasing at the 
same time. On the basis of programmed operational dependencies and rules, 
operations management systems can assume a supporting role in this context. The 
challenge faced in the development of this kind of system is to keep operation 
user-friendly despite significant intricacies in the background. 
2.6 
Increasing Cost Pressures 
The further increasing cost pressures call for the inclusion of cost-related criteria – 
apart from the factors mentioned above – when assessing planning alternatives. 
One example is the evaluation of transports on the bench. The specific costs of 
travelling-gear repairs associated with these transports must be included in 
production planning by means of a key indicator. 
3 
Strategy for Developing Mining-Related Operations 
Management Systems 
The development of operations management systems in mining looks back on a 
long history. Depending on the operational requirements and IT-related 
possibilities, IT and PDP systems were implemented. While in the past the  
 
 

Market-Oriented, Flexible and Energy-Efficient Operations Management

systems tended to support individual processes, today's focus is also on main 
process chains and their interconnection with adjacent activities in ancillary 
processes. This makes it possible to achieve the joint overall objective of process 
optimisation. 
An opencast-mine process model was defined to provide a clear basic structure 
for the development of the systems (see Fig. 4). 
 
Fig. 4  Integrated opencast-mine process model 
In this model, the main processes are understood to comprise the mining, 
transport and interim storage of lignite as well as overburden movement including 
the transport and dumping of the material. Personnel deployment, maintenance, 
the dewatering of the opencast mine and development work as supporting service 
including the use of auxiliary equipment are summarised as ancillary processes. 
In principle, each opencast-mine process has three process levels. The first 
level involves the planning of processes all the way to equipment-deployment 
planning. The second level is about scheduling, i.e. the short-term use of 
resources. The third level deals with the actual execution, i.e. the real process with 
its operating, controlling and automation functions. At this level the actual 
situation of the opencast mine is mapped in the form of a digital model, serving as 
a basis for updating planning and scheduling. 
To achieve optimum overall opencast mine operations in economic, safety and 
technical terms, the dovetailing of the individual processes is essential. In other 
words: the information systems need to be vertically and horizontally integrated, 
with the individual process levels being able to exchange information and to 
develop in line with the specified quantities, qualities, times and costs, while at the 
same time responding to deviations by way of a feedback process.

Status and Development of Operations Management 
Systems 
There is a mining-area-consistent target structure for mining processes, which was 
developed on the basis of the integrated opencast-mine process model. This target 
structure provides all information relevant for production and ensures the 
exchange of information with associated processes (Fig. 5). 
  
Fig. 5 Overview of operations management systems for mining production 
Important individual systems are presented in what follows. 
4.1 
Digital Opencast-Mine Model 
The reliable presentation and continuation of the actual mining and dumping 
situation in near real-time are of central importance. The actual situation is 
compiled and made available in the form of a digital 3-D opencast-mine model. 
Information from different areas is merged. In essence, this information includes 
the following modules: 
- Geological deposit model indicating relevant rock strata, quality parameters, 
lithographs and tectonic structural elements. The material varieties that were 
actually encountered during mining and were classified by overburden material 
identification and coal online analysis are added to the model. This leads to a 
"learning" deposit model. 
- Obstacles in the rock such as wells, piezometers and piping from water-
management systems 

Market-Oriented, Flexible and Energy-Efficient Operations Management 
345
 
 
- Locations of belt conveyors 
- Surface of the opencast mine in order to display the mining and dumping 
progress as an important basis for determining the remaining material quantities. 
Here, photogrammetric data and the "quantity survey" from the high-capacity 
equipment's GPS systems are merged. 
4.2 
GPS Systems and Material-Flow Tracking 
GPS-based control systems for excavators (satellite-assisted excavator operation 
control, SABAS) and spreaders (satellite-assisted spreader operation control, 
SATAS) and a material-flow tracking system (MAFLU) were developed in several 
steps in the opencast mines. This system group called SAMASA has been 
developed into a Rhenish mining area standard, which will now be rolled out in all 
operations. 
These systems fulfil three important basic functions: 
1. Operator assistance including the display of the area to be excavated or to be 
dumped at present 
2. Precise recording of the mining and dumping progress by volume and material 
variety for documentation purposes and the determination of remaining material 
quantities 
3. Identification of the masses and material varieties transported on the belt 
conveyors for the connection of excavators and spreaders and the calculation of 
energy efficiency 
4.2.1 
Satellite-Assisted Excavator Operation Control 
For the digital mapping of the mining process, several GPS receivers and an 
evaluation system continuously determine the spatial movement of the so-called 
bucket-wheel enveloping surface on the basis of the equipment dimensions data. 
This surface is intersected with the read-in 3-D opencast-mine model (actual 
surface, deposit model and further information). 
The surface, volume and material varieties are analysed at regular intervals 
between two points in time and are made available for the calculation of the 
remaining material, for documentation purposes and for the MAFLU transport 
model. 
SABAS constantly compares the target surfaces from equipment scheduling 
with the actual position of the bucket wheel. On this basis, the operator assistance 
system calculates the current distances to the target surfaces. The remaining 
slewing range is continuously displayed in the horizontal direction, while in the 
vertical direction the precise distance to the working floor or slice bottom is 
shown (see Fig. 6). This enables the operator to cut an accurate working floor and 
to meet the requirements of the operation schedule, without complex geodetic 
survey staking being necessary as in the past. Since obstacles in the rock such as 
wells and piezometers are registered in the read-in opencast-mine model, SABAS 

346 
D. Gärtner, R. Hempel, and H. Rosenberg
 
 
is able to tell the operator at an early stage if they are approaching such 
operational installations and inform them of the remaining spatial distance to these 
installations. This likewise applies to cases in which operators approach tectonic 
faults (tectonic displacement areas from the deposit model). 
 
Fig. 6 SABAS operator assistance system 
4.2.2 
Material-Flow Tracking 
Material packages from SABAS are transmitted to the MAFLU transport model 
which tracks transport via all belt conveyors of the conveying routes to the 
receivers in high resolution. The conveyor-belt speed, drop times at transfer points 
as well as interim measurements performed by belt scales and possibly online 
analysers are included in the calculation. The overall accuracy is basically 
determined by the measuring accuracy of the individual sensors. 
By comparing the material movement with current consumption, MAFLU 
establishes the friction coefficient and consequently the energy efficiency of the 
individual belt conveyors. This may provide indications of, for example, poorly-
aligned belt conveyors. It also provides the measurement basis for the energy 
management system. 
The display of the changing material varieties on the conveying routes is 
crucial for operations management as it can help, among other things, to avoid the 
feeding of incorrect materials to the spreader or the coal bunker. 
 
 

Market-Oriented, Flexible and Energy-Efficient Operations Management 
347
 
 
4.2.3 
Satellite-Assisted Spreader Operation Control 
In the case of the spreader, GPS is used to define the spatial position of the 
discharge boom. SATAS calculates a model of the developing fill on the basis of 
the material tracked by MAFLU and the discharge trajectory. The model provides 
a rough overview of the material distribution. Scanning lasers on the discharge 
boom continuously scan the fill surface and give the discharge model a more 
precise shape. If the scanning lasers are not available, the discharge model can 
serve as backup for the continuation of the model (Fig. 7). 
 
Fig. 7  Operating principle of SATAS  
The high-capacity equipment operator is constantly informed of the current 
discharge height and reach in comparison with the operating schedule. In a 
combined representation of the actual discharge surface and the target surface, 
discrepancies are stated numerically. The scanned and modelled dump surface is 
made available for the calculation of the remaining material and for 
documentation. 
4.3 
Design Systems Used in Equipment Scheduling 
4.3.1 
Information Technology 
Within the scope of the operation-schedule preparation and based on the current 
digital opencast-mine model and the specifications of medium-term opencast-mine 
planning, the specific spatial stipulations for excavator and spreader deployment 
are elaborated together with the associated material calculation by material 
varieties in place. For years now, the IT system LAVA (deposit management and 
assessment) has been offering suitable special-purpose applications of various 
designs (interactive CAD systems, batch-oriented calculation algorithms, 
assessment and visualisation functions) as well as Excel applications for slice 
division. 

348 
D. Gärtner, R. Hempel, and H. Rosenberg
 
 
To fulfil the requirements to be met by integrated operations management 
systems, to cut the maintenance costs of the heterogeneous programme landscape, 
and to facilitate faster process operations, the slice division and dumping scheme 
planning modules of the equipment-scheduling software were modernised 
applying up-to-date IT options and standards. It is planned to use this technology 
also in other planning areas and in deposit modelling. 
This leads to the following IT-related advantages: 
 Elimination of system-related redundancies and inconsistencies in data 
storage by systematic object-oriented storage of the graphical and 
alphanumeric object elements in the database (RWE standard: ORACLE) 
 Creation of a consistent programme-internal information flow in connection 
with interface reduction 
 Use of default development environments and software elements to improve 
application development and maintenance 
 Use of optimised backup processes to reduce the periods in which the IT 
systems are not available 
As the affinity for IT varies among the users of the operations management 
systems, simple and systematic user prompting was emphasised. This was achieved 
by workflow-oriented programme control in connection with corresponding user 
dialogues that visually display complex background information and their individual 
editing steps to the user in an adequately condensed format. There are only few 
manually controlled single functions whose sequences are not controlled at system 
level (CAD-oriented drawing). Proceeding from a consistent data set (graphics and 
technical data), users are largely guided by the system in their editing steps and are 
able to work in an object-oriented way. 
4.3.2 
Slice Planning 
As bucket-wheel excavators are predominantly operated in terrace-cutting mode, 
the individual slice is decisive for materials management. This particularly applies 
to coal mining, where the face shows widely varying coal quality parameters in 
the vertical direction. To supply the power plants with the right coal quality, it is 
necessary to define the slices as precisely as possible, with foresight and in line 
with needs, and to determine the coal grade. 
For a long time, the EXCEL-based software IKOLA (interactive determination 
of lignite qualities based on deposit databases) was used for this purpose. This 
software, however, no longer meets today's requirements so that it was replaced 
with the new IKOLA2 module which incorporates the new technology described 
above. The new module also offers the option to define slices in the overburden, 
so that the face can be divided in an optimal way as regards the quantities of 
mixed soils that are difficult to transport and dump (Fig. 8).  

Market-Oriented, Flexible and Energy-Efficient Operations Management

Fig. 8 Slice planning as a guideline for the mining process 
IKOLA2 offers the following basic functions for slice definition: 
• 
Interactive, object-oriented working on a 3-D model (3-D or 2-D views) 
• 
Read-in of the current, digital opencast-mine model and general planning 
specifications 
• 
Automatic slice division using the actually excavated slices of the previous 
conveyor-belt location 
• 
Editing of the slice limits 
• 
Ad hoc calculation of the slice averages of all quality parameters input to 
the deposit model 
• 
Option to automatically define deposit horizons (e.g. hanging wall) as slice 
limit 
• 
Ad hoc calculation of the remaining material either in relation to slices or 
the deposit structure based on the current surface from SABAS 
• 
Transmission of remaining material quantities to the mining schedule 
• 
Transmission of the final operation schedule to SABAS 
4.3.3 
Dumping Scheme Planning 
For the placement of unstable materials, geomechanically-tested schemes must be 
observed which specify the permissible position and sequence for different 
material varieties. The KIPMASS3D module (Fig. 9) facilitates the complex spatial 
design process with functions which are similar to those offered by IKOLA2. 
Special functions of KIPMASS3D are automatic spatial positioning of the 
dumping schemes along the dumping level and Calculation of the resulting 3-D 
bodies per dumping-scheme element for the transmission to SATAS.

4.4 
Production Planning 
The purpose of production planning is to compare the material flow from all 
bucket-wheel excavators to the spreaders and coal bunkers in the different time 
horizons and the scheduled outages of equipment, while taking into account the 
manifold external and internal factors mentioned earlier (Chapter 2, Fig. 2).  
The FÖRDERPLAN (Production Plan) system assists decision-makers in this 
complex key task. Typical features of this system are the illustration of the 
excavator and spreader block sequences and of scheduled outages for mining-
related and maintenance purposes in the form of time bars indicating quantities 
and material varieties, output estimates and descriptive information (Fig. 10).  
The level of planning can be adjusted, enabling the user to access even the slice 
level. The user interface permits interactive modification e.g. of block sequences. 
As FÖRDERPLAN is linked to the calculation of remaining material quantities of 
IKOLA2 and KIPMASS3D, the current opencast mining progress is incorporated 
into the system. A wide range of assessment options, e.g. the comparison of 
mixed-soil supply and possible receivers or the development of the bunker level, 
opens the way for the immediate evaluation of planning alternatives. The number 
of key indicators for the evaluation of these alternatives will be stepped up 
gradually in order to be able to factor in cost and energy-efficiency aspects. 
All opencast mines work with the same data set and use standardised software. 
This facilitates the comparison with other opencast mines, so that bottlenecks or 
conflicts over the supply of power plants with blended coal from the Hambach and 
Garzweiler opencast mines can be identified with foresight and in good time. 
Examples include the cross-mine assessment of the production plans with a view 
to the future development of the sulphur mean in the supply with blended coal, as

this mean may not exceed a certain value. The system points out potentially 
critical periods, enabling the user to adjust the block sequence of the coal 
excavators accordingly. 
  
Fig. 10 Production plan with details 
Since the timetable of production planning is linked to the spatial development 
of the blocks, a series of important details must be automatically provided for the 
purpose of horizontal integration. Examples include: 
- 
Automatic notification of the point in time when wells and piezometers 
will be shortened 
- 
Geometric opencast-mine position at a future date to provide a planning 
basis also for other activities (repair sites, pipes, pump stations, etc.) 
The ISSP (integrated outage planning) system was developed on the same 
software basis as the production plan. It serves the close, interactive alignment of 
outages with the maintenance department.

Outlook 
Further system integration is to the fore in the future development process. The 
linking of the production plan – being the key element of operations management 
– to the adjacent systems, e.g. load management and personnel-deployment 

352

planning, will be further improved. In addition, the energy management system is 
to be integrated into the operations management systems (see Fig. 11). 
 
Fig. 11 Production plan with system integration 
Modules that allow some of the planning processes to be automated will be 
integrated into the planning systems. In future, all operations management systems 
will be joined in a so-called "operations management control centre" and will 
provide an overview of all information crucial for decisions on the planning and 
scheduling of equipment deployment.  
The simulation and optimisation software initially used for coal logistics in the 
North-South railway system is to be gradually implemented in other operations-
management fields to improve the evaluation of alternatives. In future, (semi-
)automatic high-capacity equipment will receive precise work orders from the 
operations-management systems for model-assisted operation.

Summary 
The three large-scale opencast mines of RWE Power AG are operated in 
performance operations to supply the power plants and refining factories in the 
Rhenish lignite mining area. For some time now, the development and operation 
of the opencast mines have been determined by a multitude of external and 
internal factors, which will continue to increase in number both today and in 
future – not least due to the transformation in energy systems. Among these 
factors we find market-related flexibility requirements and energy efficiency. The 
rising number of factors influencing operational decisions calls for the 
improvement in and further development of processes and supporting IT and PDP 
systems – so-called operations management systems. This applies to all process

levels – from long-term planning to the scheduling of high-capacity equipment – 
and along the entire coal process chain, starting with mining operations and 
ending with the coal consumer. 
The operations-management systems rely on GPS-based technology which 
records equipment deployment and delivers a digital image of the opencast-mine 
progress in near real-time. At the associated scheduling and planning levels, 
equipment deployment, material distribution and coal quality control are carefully 
prepared. The result is a set of precise instructions for the operator assistance 
systems on site. Cutting-edge information technology is used, with user-friendly 
operational concepts promoting acceptance and being key to success. Upcoming 
further-development activities focus on continued system integration and the 
automation of planning processes and equipment.

Options for the Use of Sensor Technologies  
for a Quality-Controlled Selective Mining  
in Central German Lignite Mines – Results  
of the IBI-Project (Innovative Brown-Coal 
Integration)

Introduction 
With over 180 million tons per year, Germany is by far the largest lignite producer 
in the world. But only a small part of the German lignite is used for material 
applications. Therefore the Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg worked 
for 3 years with partners from the industry at the ibi-project (innovative brown-
coal integration). The aim of the project was the interdisciplinary research on the 
material use of lignite in Central Germany. The main development goals were an 
operating diagram for selective mining of quality lignite as well as the 
development of mining concept, which uses sensor technology for material and 
boundary layer detection. The article gives an introduction how different sensors 
like georadar, XRF, as well as optical and infrared systems were tested and used to 
achieve these goals. Therefore the main working principles of these sensors will 
be explained besides the idea how to attach one of these measuring devices 
directly at the boom of a bucket-wheel excavator to measure and recognize the 
underneath lying surfaces or guiding layers. In the end the consideration and 
results how these technologies could work as an aid and the dividing layer 
recognition and selective mining process should occur is also examined.

Actual State of That in Selective Mining 
The mining technology in the current situation is designed for a high output, in 
which the selectivity plays a minor role. But only selective mining guarantees a 
material application with a maximum product yield. Selective mining yet again is 
dependent on a precise material and boundary detection, which sets high level of 
sensory detection ahead. Furthermore in case of the actual production technology 
used in German opencast mines, like bucket-wheel excavators, bucket-chain 
excavators, Continuous Surface Miners and Mobile Technology, it is to mention 
that the machines with a high selective digging height own only a low dividing

sharpness. Nevertheless primarily for reasons of the existing production 
technology in the Central German mining region and the economic efficiency as 
well as the demanded performances, the consideration of selective mining by 
bucket-wheel excavator was made as a result of suitable consultations. Therefore 
the bucket-wheel excavator was used as basic production technology in this 
project on which the operations of different sensor systems were tested [1, 2]. 
A selective mining of horizontally stored layers can be carried out with the 
bucket-wheel excavator in the side block cutting effectively. Thereby the 
excavator will proceed beside the opencast mining-sided embankment of  
the passageway and can remove so bigger bench parts in slices. Condition for this 
is that the thickness of the single layers to be separated of each other is largely 
enough to get still a sufficient production amount with the bucket-wheel. The 
separation of the layers can be carried out in the terrace cut in best when the 
bucket-wheel proceed after a slewing process (cut) several times in cutting 
direction and the height position of the bucket-wheel is only reasonable changed. 
With the terrace cut the dividing surface can be laid between the single terraces 
in such a way that they correspond to the dividing surface between the single 
layers. However, the uppermost dividing surface may not lie higher than the lower 
edge of the bucket-wheel in his highest position. This is the selective digging 
height of the excavator (ha, figure 1). For the operation of the excavator it is 
important that the maximum height position of the bucket-wheel can be reached in 
every position of the excavator, so also under a certain excavator slope [3, 4].

digging height) [3]

Optimization Approaches 
To optimize selective mining a high level of sensory detection is very important; 
whereby the fact here is that it needs to be sensors suitable for mining technology. 
The number of the possible sensor systems was limited after detailed search, 
considering the requirements for the sensors and on account of the past research 
results by the numerous procedures with which a dividing surfaces recognition is 
possible. While looking for potential solution attempts in the area of sensor 
technology it is a matter of considering that with a choice of a suitable measuring

the case of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) it concerns an optical procedure that with 
the help of typical fluorescence signals recognizes qualitative differences between 
significant material types. In different field tests carried out 60 point 
measurements were taken at a coal seam in an open pit mine in Central Germany. 
In the analysis by which it was concentrated on the elements iron, titanium, 
calcium, sulphur and silicon it has become clear that the layer sequence of the coal 
seam can be exactly defined and understood on account of measured values.

Abstract. Lignite is still the most important source of energy in Germany. In 
2012, a total of 185.4 million tons of lignite was mined here. In addition to elec-
tricity generation and district heating, processed products such as briquettes, dust 
and coke are also produced. Besides this, a very small amount of lignite (~1% of 
the lignite mined worldwide) is used for non-energetic utilisation. In central Ger-
many, the ibi alliance was formed to further promote this particular sector. The 
aim is to use lignite as a source of hydrocarbons by further developing technology, 
plants and processes. An alternative method of producing basic chemical products 
would reduce Germany’s dependence on oil and natural gas imports. The success-
ful implementation of this goal requires not only the development of chemical 
processes but also a secure supply of lignite. 
Since deposit conditions in Germany will become more and more challenging 
(in deposit depth, seam splitting and - dips), more well developed extraction and 
conveyance techniques as well as mining technology will become preconditions if 
deposits are to be mined sustainably and economically. 
It is this issue that the companies MIBRAG, FAM, TAKRAF, ABB and 
Freiberg University of Mining and Technology are addressing in one of a total of 
five joint research projects within the ibi alliance. 
MIBRAG’s involvement includes the conception of mining technology where 
the selective extraction of different coal qualities plays a key role. Typical deposit 
data were defined and then used to formulate the specific technical requirements 
in terms of mechanical engineering. 
In most cases, the use of large machinery is favoured when planning mining 
operations. The research focuses on compact bucket wheel excavators that allow 
improved handling of biaxial inclination (up to 10%) as well as greater mobility. 
On the stopes and at the border slope system, continuous conveyor systems are 
considered for the transportation of overburden and coal. Due to the depth of the 
deposit, more challenging requirements have to be set for the conveyer system 
along the border slope system. Moveable transfer systems are to replace the con-
ventional central, stationary mass distributors. Since the intention is to use the 
conveyer system in the border slope system to transport several qualities of coal 
before then transferring them to 2 main conveyer belts leading towards the coal 
pile, another crucial focus of the joint research project is on material tracking, 
controlling the conveyer routes (including for overburden) and stockpiling. 
Further research activities are focusing on the identification of mayor geologi-
cal layers which shall be done during the mining process on the excavator. The 

364

main focus here is on contactless systems. Online raw material analysis can be 
used to write the data back directly into the deposit model.  
These innovations in the fields of engineering and sensor technology allow 
modified mining technologies. Furthermore it opens up the potential for signifi-
cant improvements by mining geologically challenging deposits. In the ibi proc-
ess, research is currently focused on lignite products only. Additional focus on 
“overburden products” in the future will make it possible to carry out accepted, 
resource-efficient and sustainable surface mining operations.

Introduction 
Deposit conditions in Central Germany will become more and more difficult, 
which is especially caused by increasing deposit depths, seam splitting and – in-
clination. The following figures show the difference between present and future 
deposits. 
 
Fig. 1 Present deposit conditions 
 
Fig. 2 Future deposit conditions 
In spite of this challenging deposit conditions the demand for mining products 
with high and consistent quality increases. At the same time the requirement for a 
sustainable mine development becomes more and more important, not only to the 
industry, but also to the public. Therefore lignite coal should not only be used to 
generate electricity and heat but also to produce chemical products. 
In Central Germany existed a high knowledge about selective extraction of lig-
nite coal and the production of basic chemical products out of lignite. To preserve 
and develop this knowledge the ibi alliance was founded. Twelve partners belong

to the ibi alliance. On the scientific side there are the University of Freiberg and 
the University of Applied Science Merseburg. The industrial partners are ABB 
Automation, EPC Engineering Consulting GmbH, FAM GmbH, IHU mbH, In-
fraLeuna GmbH, isw gGmbH, Linde Group/ Linde Gas, MIBRAG mbH, 
Romonta GmbH and TAKRAF GmbH. 
The ibi project consists of six composite projects (VP1 …. VP6):

Deposit Management (VP1) 
In the first subproject MIBRAG and the University of Freiberg work on improv-
ing the prognosis of geological models and increasing its content. 
Today’s geological models are based on interpolation, in which the space in be-
tween the Exploration drillholes is displayed through continuous functions. Be-
cause of this smoothing, the variability of deposits remains unconsidered. 
Future geological models will be based on stochastically approaches. In this 
case the variability of deposits is furthermore considered by random elements. 
These are for example the mapping of the wall face, sensor systems at the mining 
machine or online raw material analysis. 
The Usage of stochastically methods has several advantages, like the inclusion 
of different data sources and a more realistic display of the deposit. 
This improved deposit model is mainly used to create a mine layout, which en-
ables the selective extraction of lignite coal. The main objective of the VP1 (Inte-
grated deposit management) is the development of an optimized mine layout. Be-
sides the stochastically, geological model other criteria are considered,  
for example: customer requirements, economical influences, safety issues and  
efficient use of mining machines.

Highly Selective Lignite Mining and Supply (VP 2) 
Because of the geological conditions it is not only important to develop a new way 
of geological modelling but also more suitable mining technologies, as well as 
extraction and conveyance techniques. VP 2 deals with this topic. 
The main objective is the continuous production of lignite coal with consistent 
quality parameters. Up to 4 coal qualities need to be provided to produce different 
chemical basic products. To reach this aim it is necessary to develop: 
 
 high selective mining machines 
 methods, that recognize parting surfaces and track material flows 
 sensor and measuring technologies 
 new conveyer systems (on the stopes and border slope system) 
 material flow and stockpiling models 
 
To reach these aims 6 work packages have been determined. 
3.1 
Mining Organization 
The first part is about general mining organization. Therefore MIBRAG defined 
an example mine. This mine consists of several coal seams, which are variable in 
depth. The form of the seams is trough shaped. 
In the course of the consideration a mine layout has been created by MIBRAG. 
The stope system changes a lot because the stopes are supposed to follow the 
seams as good as possible. Consequently the individual stopes often vary in the 
height of cut and the inclining during the mining process. That is why several face 
advance technologies have been created. These face advance technologies are 
mainly focused on coal qualities and geological conditions. 
This geometric mine structure leads to requirements for the mechanical engi-
neering of mining machines and conveying systems, especially on the border slope 
system. 
3.2 
Mechanical Requirements 
Due to the mine layout three possible machinery uses are considered. Only two of 
them are studied in detail. These are on one side the exclusive usage of bucket 
wheel excavators and on the other side the combination of bucket wheel excava-
tors and mobile technique. 
Although mobile technique is able to work efficient in difficult and rapidly 
changing deposit conditions, the only use of mobile technique is too expensive for 
a deposit, which has an overburden thickness up to 160 m and a total depth up to 
270 m.

Abstract. The coal mining industry plays an important role contributed to the 
national economy and development in Indonesia, however the mine accidents 
become as a sensitive issue or problem. The main cause of the mining accidents is 
still dominating the low safety awareness and accountable by workers, and also 
improperly cost spent in the occupational health and safety (OHS) program. This 
paper describes the concept behind the return on prevention and workers’ 
perception in the occupational health and safety in relation to prevent accidents or 
improve safety performance. The proactive action plan related to accident 
prevention is as an essential step of the risk management process. Participation 
and intervention for all employees are important and urgent, especially for the 
frontline workers, which are crucial in achieving good safety performance with the 
financial support properly. The investment of the people and money properly are 
an effective strategy to prevent accidents in order to protect people, property, 
process and profit of the company for a short or long term benefit, and will also 
give a good image for sustainability in the mining business.  
Keywords: coal mining, mine accidents, prevention, return on prevention, 
workers  perception, intervention, occupational health and safety.

Introduction 
The mining industry in Indonesia is expected to grow rapidly in the 5 to 10 years 
into the future and will become an increasingly strategic sector for development 
and economic improvement. It will be encouraging increased domestic and 
foreign investment in this sector with national and international banks supporting. 
Indonesia is one of the key players in the to supply the industry needs to the 
developed countries through the export of minerals and coal, however must also 
be fulfill the domestic needs. The established of the mining law No. 4 of 2009 
related to the minerals and coal mining, which one of the important point is 
improving of the value added of the minerals as the main priority by the 
processing or refining until the final product. This all mining process activities

should be complied with the law in order to increase state revenues to achieve 
welfare of the Indonesian people equitably in accordance to mandate of the 
constitution of 1945 in article 33 point 3.  
The energy and mineral resources sector has an important role in the 
development and economic of Indonesia. The economic contribution of these 
sectors is significantly to the economy of Indonesia, with amount IDR 415.20 
trillion1 or 32.13% of the total state of revenue (minerals & coal mining share 
9.56% in 2012), but the tax income is still the largest contributor to the state 
revenue[1]. Most of mining operations in Indonesia are using surface mine 
methods of the open pit mine, because the majority of the mineral and coal 
reserves found in the shallow areas. The main characteristic of mine operations is 
using truck and shovel system with a large amount of manpowers. Indonesia has 
an important role player as a supplier of world coal. According to the estimation 
of the world coal association (WCA)[2] in 2012 has been said that Indonesia is the 
largest coal exporter country with total coal’s share of the world market achieved 
383 mio.tons following Australia with 301 mio.tons. The comparison of the coal 
demands between domestic and export are approximately 21.3% and 78.7% in 
2012, and also most influenced to the national economic incomes. 
The mine accident is one of the most important issue or problem in the mining 
industry in Indonesia which can disrupt the production processes. The high 
number of the mine accidents occurrence in the workplaces is caused by the low 
safety awareness, low to comply safety regulations and rules, lack of 
communication and coordination, low leadership, and inadequate cost spent in the 
occupational health and safety (OHS) program. These problems are going to 
become as a big issue in the mining industry of Indonesia, due to, it needs the 
effective solution how to reduce or prevent the accidents at workplace. Several of 
the mining accidents show in the figure 1.1[3], it can be influenced the mindset or 
concentration of the workers during work.

The important issue relates to the coal mining industry before the Mining Law 
no. 4 of 2009 established, that most of the coal mining operations are conducted 
by the mining contractors as the main player for mined excavation.  
The criteria of the mine accidents in Indonesia must involve five elements 
according to the ministry of mining and energy decree of the Kepmen 
555.K/26/M.PE/1995, in the article no. 39. The mine accident is an unplanned, 
unexpected, undesired, uncontrolled and undesigned events which occur suddenly 
and caused injury to the workers in connection with a work relationship of the 
mining operations. The five elements of the mining accident are the actual 
accident occurred, resulting injured to the mine worker/s or people who get a 
permit from the technical mine manager, consequences of the mining business 
activities, the accident occurred during working hours to injure of mine worker/s 
or people who get permits, and the accident occurred within the area of the mining 
activity or operation or in the project area.  
Improperly managed of the potential hazard and risk in the mine site activities, 
it will cause an accident which resulted in losses, such as the people, production, 
property, and profit (4Ps). Investments in the occupational health and safety 
(OHS), however, will contribute to the commercial success of the enterprise, and 
safety performance improvement. The companies are not following the statutory 
and social responsibility requirements but also their own business concern (e.g. 
image, performance).

Objective and Methodology 
2.1 
Objective 
The main objective of this study is evaluated of the workers’ perception 
(qualitative) and cost spend in the occupational health and safety program 
(quantitative) at the companies in relation to accident prevention. The accident is 
preventable if the hazard and risk in the workplace or mine site were managed 
properly with a good condition, proper compliance to regulations, good budgeting 
of occupational health and safety (OHS), and competent workers[3].  
In general, the objectives are described to evaluate of the mine accident 
statistics, the validity and reliability tests of the questionnaire, focus group 
interviews, worker relationships, and the cost effectiveness or cost benefit 
analysis. The objective is assessed with the return on prevention of the micro 
economic model to justify the benefit of the prevention work and intervention by 
the workers’ perception in order to prevent accidents for safety improvement to 
achieve the zero accident vision. The idea framework concept of the strategy to 
prevent accidents has been modified from the risk management process[4], it is 
shown in the Figure 2.1.

Step 2: Sampling 
Before measure the validity and reliability tests, the number of the respondents 
must be determined by the Solvin’s equation. The equation shows below: 
࢙=
ۼ
૚ା൫ۼ . ܍૛൯  
 
 
             2.3 
Where, s is the number of sample, N is the total population, e is a margin of error. 
Step 3: Validity and reliability tests 
Testing the validity and reliability of the new questionnaires in order to ensure the 
coefficient of correlation values (r). The coeficient of correlation (r) values are 
calculated using the Pearson’s product moment, Spearman-Brown, and 
Cronbach’s Alpha equations.  
The value of r is defined by Pearson’s product moment equation: 
࢘=
ܖ∑࢞.࢟ି ∑࢞.∑࢟ 
ඥሼ(ܖ∑࢞²ି(∑࢞)²ሽሼܖ∑࢟²ି(∑࢟)²ሽ                              2.4 
Where, r is the coefficient of linear correlation, n = number of the respondents, 
x = score item of the question (e.g. question number 1 for all respondents), and y = 
total score of the respondent (e.g. respondent number 1 for all questions).   
The next calculation is using the Spearman-Brown formula to repeated the 
calculation according the validity test. The equation is the following: 
࢘࢕ࢊࢊ ࢋ࢜ࢋ࢔=
૛ܚ  
(૚ାܚ)        
 
 
            2.5 
Where, rodd even is the coefficient of correlation odd even, r is the coefficient of 
correlation. 
The final step calculation is using Cronbach’s alpha equation. Alpha is 
developed by Lee Cronbach in 1951[7] to provide a measure of the internal 
consistency of a test or scale, it is expressed as a number ranged of scale between 
0 and 1. Alpha is an important concept in the evaluation of assessment and 
questionnaires[8]. The comparison of the calculation resulted values of r will 
compare with the supporting table data of the Person’s product moment can see in 
Table 2.2. The interpretation of alpha score is defined into five classes [9-11], see 
in Table 2.3.

Where, rca is the coefficient of correlation of cronbach alpha, that use to 
determine of the consistency of correlations (reliability test equation of Cronbach 
alpha), Σ(sev
²) is the total variance of the score on each question, ݏ௩² is the total 
variance of samples. 
The valid criteria result is defined if the value of the r or rcount is bigger than the 
rtable, otherwise if  the r or rcount is less than the rtable value is not valid. The 
comparison of the calculation results of the coefficient of correlation (rcount) will 
be compared to the rtable from table data of the Pearson’s product moment and 
Cronbach’s alpha. In this paper, the number of respondents (n) is  400, and 
significant level is 5%, so the rtable is 0.098.   
Step 4: Descriptive statistic assessment of the questionnaire  
The questionnaire is consisting the seven elements of OHS with 35 questions  
(Q-35). The questionnaires shall be scored by the Likert scale assessment. The 
five level of the likerts are defined as a strongly disagree to strongly agree with 
score 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest score and 5 is the highest score. A mean score 
over 3.00 is generally considered as a positive result when it is the mean value of 
slighly higher. The questionnaires are a diagnostic or intervention tools which can 
be used to evaluate the the organization goals on safety in the company. 
Step 5: Interview 
The interviews conduct as a focus group interviews to the representative 
respondents of the supervisors and frontline workers for getting the actual 
informations related to accidents prevention at work. The summary result of the 
focus group interview will show in a bar graph that represent of the low, moderate, 
and high of the workers performance.

Step 6: Observation 
Field observations have been conducted in several workplaces location such as the 
mine pit operation, hauling roads traffic, workshop, and the mine support 
facilities. The field observations are also based on the seven elements of OHS as a 
guidelines. The objective of the field observations are finding the real situation or 
condition of workers during work. 
Step 7: Return on prevention assessment (financial) 
The return on prevention assessment is calculating using the net present value 
(NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and net benefit-cost ratio (Net B/C ratio) in 
order to find the cost effectiveness or the break even point. This assessment is 
using to determine the minimum standard of the money invest in an occupational 
health and safety programs at the companies. The assessments are defined using 
several equations as follows: 
The net present value is defined by the equation as follows:

Where, NPV is net present value, T is the number of time periods of 
investment, t is the time accounting period, i is the interest or discounted rate, PVt 
inflows is the present value incomes in the time accounting period, PVt outflows is the 
present value expenses in the time accounting period, Ct is the cash of income or 
receive, and Co is cost of capital investment in the initial year of zero.  
The NPV criterias can see in the following Table 2.4.

In this paper, the author has been chosen for case study of the representative of the 
four mining companies are Adaro Indonesia, Berau Coal, Trubaindo Coal Mining, 
and Kaltim Prima Coal. These companies were significantly contributed to the 
national coal output (e.g. 275 mio.tons) about 37.06% from 2006 to 2012. The 
cumulative of the Indonesian mineral and coal of mine accidents that reported by 
the CCOWs from 2006 up to 2012 are accounted of minor injury for 918, serious 
injury of 618, and fatality accidents of 172. Comparison of the fatal accidents 
between mineral and coal mines are 33.14% and 66.86%. Top four open pit coal 
mine companies are contributed amount 17.33% of the total mine accidents of 
Indonesia, but especially for coal mine fatal accidents contributed about 30.86%. 
The comparison between coal production and mining accident shows in the Figure 
3.1[12].

workers contribution is about of 91%. The management level is involving the 
supervisor, superintendent, and manager positions. The frontline workers are 
involving the heavy equipment operator, light vehicle driver, and mechanic 
positions. The process of survey has been done in 2012 by delivery of the 
questionnaire, focus group interview, and field observation directly to the workers 
during work and working conditions, it can see in a Figure 3.2.

Result and Discussion 
4.1 
Frequency and Severity Rates 
Lost-time injury is defined as an occurrence that resulted in a fatality, permanent 
disability or time lost from work of one day/shift or more. The LTIFR and LTISR 
are important to justified the safety performance of the company. 
The figure 4.1 shows the comparison of the frequency rates of the four 
companies and Indonesia. Berau Coal (BC) and Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) show 
the average values of the frequency rates of 0.19 and 0.28, it rates smaller than 
0.40 as the threshold point within a good safety performance conditions. With the 
exception for KPC in year 2009 with value of 0.54. However, Adaro Indonesia 
(AI), Trubaindo Coal Mining (TCM) and the Indonesian average indicate values 
of 0.53, 0.45 and 0.52 which is larger than 0.40 and smaller than 1.00. This means  
the safety performance conditions are fair. For example, frequency rate average of 
Kaltim Prima Coal is 0.19, it means in one million manhours worked are 
involving 0.19 person injured, or in one person injured within 5,263,158 manhours 
worked.  
The figure 4.2 shows the comparison of the LTISR between four companies 
and Indonesia. The average of the severity rates of the four companies and 
Indonesia are larger than the threshold point of 80. It means that the four 
companies is contributed fatal injury to national statistic as well. BC and KPC

show the average values of the severity rates of 157.73 and 80.08 that it rates 
smaller than 240 as the threshold point of the fair safety performance conditions. 
However, the AI, TCM and Indonesia average values of 264.44, 386.27, and 
324.84. It means that the severity rates are larger than 240 as an threshold point of 
the bad safety performance condition. For example, in 2012, the severity rate of 
Trubaindo Coal Mining is 488.59. It means in every one million manhours worked 
of the company will lost 488.59 work days, or in every one lost work day within 
2,047 manhours worked.

Sampling 
Slovin’s equation will find out the sample size of a population, for example the 
number of employees of Adaro Indonesia in 2012 is 23,555. The calculation result 
is defined with the confidence level of 95%, and then the margin of error of 5%, as 
follows: 
࢙=
૛૜, ૞૞૞
૚+ (૛૜, ૞૞૞ ܠ ૙. ૙૞૛) = ૛૜, ૞૞૞
૞ૢ. ૡૢ= ૜ૢ૜. ૜૛ 
The number 393.32 is equal 394 employees, in this paper will use 
approximately of 400 respondents in the survey of the questionnaire within each 
company. 
4.3 
Validity and Reliability Tests 
The vaildity and reliability tests of the questionnaires are complied to the 
requirements, and it can be used as an instrument to measure the working 
conditions of the company in order to accidents prevention. The calculation steps 
are determined of the coefficient of correlation (r or rcount) by the Person’s product 
moment, Spearman Brown, and Cronbach alpha equations, then the result 
compare to the rtable values. The result of the coefficient of correlation (r) values of

Likert Scale Assessment 
The result of the Figure 4.3 relates to the four coal mine companies. Perception of 
the respondents from the four coal mine companies think that the OHS 
organization is the main priority to reviewed first in order to prevent accidents at 
work (the highest average score of 4.18). Followed by the PMCU, TE, IET, PPE, 
Signalization, and the last priority is the employment injury insurance but should 
be considered too (lowest average score of 3.87, and the total average score is 
4.04). In the figure shows that the respondent’s perception of the four companies 
almost the same of the tendencies in the radar plot graph, it means no matter small 
as well as big scale of the mining companies, the perceptions show almost the 
same results.

Suggestion Summary 
The OHS organization is important things to consider in order to prevent 
accidents. The OHS organization is defined into several sub element improvement 
efforts, it can see in Figure 4.4 and 4.5. 
The result of the Figure 4.4 relates to respondent suggestions from the four coal 
mine companies. Every respondent gives one or more suggestions to the company 
in order to improve safety performance or the accidents prevention. In this radar 
plot graph, the respondents’ suggestion from the four coal mine companies have 
the same options which the OHS organization should be reviewed as the main 
priority. All respondents think the organization is the main tools to coordinate all 
personnel in order to prevent accidents. This radar plot indicates that small as well 
as big scale mining companies have the same target to be improved. 
The following result of the Figure 4.5 relates to respondents’ suggestion for 
organization improvement in the companies. In this radar plot graph is elaborated 
improvement efforts of the OHS organization as a mention in Fig. 4.4. Suggestion 
of the respondents are involved the five sub elements priority in order to prevent 
accidents at work such as improve the safety accountable and awareness as the 
main priority for all workers, followed by comply and obey of the OHS rules, 
including follow the safety work instructions, hazards identification, inspection 
and supervisory towards all type of the risky jobs, improvement the commitment 
to safety and personnel communication, and the last but not least priority is 
improved the support facilities (e.g. comfortable rest building area at mine site 
operations). All these sub elements should be considered and applied by the OHS 
organization for a good business in mining.

Interview 
The summary results of the interview shall be described in terms of the rating 
points in the Figure 4.6. The rating points are determined into three types of a low 
performance is one, moderate is two, and high performance is three. The summary 
results of the supervisor level show above the average rating point of two, with the 
highest rating point is 2.35 (Adaro Indonesia/AI) and the lowest rating point is 
2.11 (Trubaindo Coal Mining/TCM). However, the frontline workers show result 
lower than the average rating point, with the highest rating point is 1.59 (Adaro 
Indonesia) and the lowest rating point is 1.30 (Trubaindo Coal Mining). Based on 
the rating points as a mention above, the frontline workers should be an important 
concern in order to improve the knowledge and behavior through the OHS training 
and education, accurate information given, also improve and intensive personal 
communication constructively. The supervisor level is concerned to improve two 
ways communication to safety as an intense and constructive.

Observation 
The field observations have been conducted in several workplace locations such as 
mine pit operations, hauling road traffics, workshop, and the mine supports 
facilities. The field observations are also based on the seven elements of OHS as a 
guideline. The worker violations still occur during work at the workplace or at the 
mine site activities, such as violation of traffic and safety signs, improper usage of 
the personal protective equipments. Also found the several working conditions or 
support facility at mine sites still need to improve and maintain properly, such as 
lack of the lighting during working at night at disposal areas or mine pits, 
restroom facility in a bad condition. The standard level of the training, PMCU, and 
EII systems are not equal between mine operator and contractors. The personal 
communication gap between the frontline workers and supervisors are still

happening. the The personal safety promotion and enforcement are not run in well 
yet, it means still focus on the production target goals.

4.7 
Return on Prevention 
The investments consist of the seven elements of the occupational health and 
safety (OHS) on each company. The cost calculation is based on the work and 
budget plan data and information from the companies.  
The Figure 4.8 shows the Bar graph related to the OHS cost expenses of the 
companies from 2008 to 2012. The comparison of the required, invested, and 
calculated of the OHS costs of the companies show in different average of the 
values. The budget of OHS costs should be reviewed and improved to become a 
progressive values of 1.68 times (ratio). It means, the company should pay the 
OHS cost as much as US $ 0.12 per ton of coal produced (US$ 0.07 per ton (as a 
standard by the government) x 1.68) or US $ 207.17 per employee in a year. 
Figure 4.9 shows the net benefit-cost ratio of the four companies with and 
without accident costs. The comparison results show that AI is 1.30 and 2.31 (ratio 
1.78, highest), BC is 1.19 and 1.38 (ratio 1.16, lowest), TCM is 1.36 and 2.02 
(ratio 1.49), and KPC is 1.47 and 2.01 (ratio 1.36). For an example of AI, the Net 
B/C ratio with accident costs is 1.30, and without accident costs is 2.31. It means, 
every one dollar invested will give the benefit 1.3 dollars (the accident occurred), 
and otherwise, if without any accident occurred with one dollar invested will give 
the benefit 2.31 dollars. For an example, the ratio 1.78 (2.31/1.3=1.78) of AI, it 
means without accident occurred in the mining operations will give 1.78 times 
within every dollar invested in OHS. The total average value of the Net B/C ratio 
of the seven elements of OHS is 1.63, and the total average value of the Net B/C 
ratio of the OHS program only (i.e. 4 elements;TE,PPE,signalization, and organization) 
for the companies is 1.72.

Conclusion 
According to the explanation of the result and discussion in Chapter 4 about the 
preventing accidents at the workplace, especially in the surface coal mining 
companies which represent the coal contract of works of the mining industries in 
Indonesia. The survey or investigation in this paper the mine accident rates, 
workers perception and the return on prevention. The assessment approaches use 
to determine the strategy to prevent accidents at work in order to achieve the zero 
accident vision. The conclusion of the survey or investigation results show in 
various expectations: 
- 
The frequency and severity rates of the mining accidents are important to 
justified the company performance on safety, but the severity rate is a better 
choice for interpreting on safety performances of the company  
- 
The validity and reliability tests of the questionnaires have complied with the 
requirements, with the coefficient of correlation cronbach alpha is larger than 
0.6 (reliable threshold value), and it can be used as an instrument to measure 
the safety performances of the company 
- 
The perception of the respondents is concerned that the OHS organization 
should be reviewed (e.g. management intervention) as the main priority in 
order to prevent accidents at workplace.  The main sub element priority of the 
OHS organization reviewed is improving the safety accountable and awareness 
of the workers  
- 
Based on the rating points of the focus group interview, the frontline workers 
should improve the knowledge and behavior through the training and 
education, accurate information given, and also improve the personal 
communication intense and constructive 

Accidents Prevention Strategy in the Surface Coal Mining in Indonesia; Vision Zero 
389
 
 
- 
The worker violations still occur during work at the workplace, and there is not 
equal safety standard or guideline between the mine operator and contractor in 
relation to give a training and education process, personal protective 
equipment, preventive medical check up, and the employment injury 
insurance. Personal communication gap between the frontline workers and 
supervisor, and also production target oriented. 
- 
Some companies invested money in the occupational health and safety (OHS) 
program are lower than the cost calculation results (78.35%), and the OHS 
costs required are also lower than the OHS cost calculation results for all 
companies surveyed (47.80%). The money invested in OHS program is almost 
the same with the accident costs spent (1:1.02). 
- 
The net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and net benefit-cost 
ratio (Net B/C ratio) are important financial calculation approaches of the 
return on prevention in order to find the minimum standard of the money 
invest in the occupational health and safety program at the company or the 
OHS cost effectiveness. The break even point (BEP) of the financial 
calculation of the seven elements of OHS is US $788.45 per employee per 
year, or the company should be invested US $ 207.17 per employee per year 
for the OHS cost program only (4 elements). 
- 
The OHS cost standard amount of US $ 0.07 per ton of coal produced should 
be reviewed, increasing become US $ 0.12 per ton of coal produced according 
the calculation results of the Net benefit-cost ratio (Net B/C ratio) is 1.72 for 
OHS only (the ratio of the seven elements is 1.63).     
 
The investment of the workers intervention and money into the occupational 
health and safety properly will give more benefits in relating to protect people, 
property and profit of the company for a short and long term of period. The 
competence people and money invested in the OHS properly will contribute 
significantly to the company image and performance as well. It can be reduced 
number of accidents (will be zero), reduced cost of accidents, reduced employee 
turnover, increase production and profits, and finally will be improved the 
satisfaction and pride of the workers in the company. In general, invested for 
every one dollar in prevention work, the expectation may return of almost two 
dollars or more. The accidents are preventable with a good condition and safety 
practices complied effective and can let the economic and social benefits.

Abstract. Belt conveyors are a key component in material transportation system 
in both opencast lignite mining and underground copper mines in Poland. Regard-
less of the structure of the mine, the problem of maintenance of belt conveyors is 
important (from the entire mining process point of view) for many reasons, such 
as: (a) conveyors are spatially distributed over a large area, (b) they create logical-
ly structured form of complex and heavy components, (c) they are operating in 
harsh mining environmental conditions, (d) failure of any belt conveyor might re-
sult in downtime of the entire production line or its major part. The paper dis-
cusses the issue of maintenance of gearboxes used in the conveyor drive systems. 
The authors have developed a CMMS-class system using GIS technology to sup-
port management of conveyors’ network. Its fundamental role is to make right  
decisions for the exchange of components of the drive systems or allow them to 
continue their work. Such defined problem requires determination of complex de-
cision rules and the definition of appropriate thresholds of diagnostic parameters. 
The article presents the procedures for determining decision thresholds, based on 
statistical modeling of diagnostic data and multidimensional data clustering. By 
selection of suitable distribution of the data and appropriate statistical parameters,

multidimensional data analysis has been performed to determine threshold values 
for the effective identification of the condition of machines and their components.

Introduction 
Belt conveyor system is a key component in the whole transportation system of 
Polish copper ore mines. Thus, it highly affects both volume and costs of produc-
tion and safety of a company as well. For this reason the issue of proper mainten-
ance of belt conveyor system is very important. Managing the process of conveyor 
operation is a singularly complicated case. Nearly one hundred of conveyors 
linked together form a very long transport network having a complex series-
parallel structure. Thus, unexpected failure of a single element might cause a 
downtime of the whole system, which might result in decrease in productivity of 
the mine [2,13,15-16]. Such downtime are often associated with large financial 
losses. Moreover they might endanger the safety of workers. There exist several 
ways of maintaining machinery, i.e. (a) operating until failure, (b) planned-
preventive maintenance and, the most effective one – (c) condition based mainten-
ance. Operation of the mining network of belt conveyors is a complex issue, thus 
it needs a multifaceted approach. It is caused by a large number of driving units 
(in various conditions) scattered on a broad area and various operating load. Addi-
tionally, it must be taken into account that the driving units are complex and huge 
machines which operates in various conditions e.g. high humidity, temperature, 
dust and salinity. Such complicated environmental and operating conditions make 
the use of classical diagnostic methods non-effective. However, availability of 
current solutions and technology makes it is possible to develop an intelligent sys-
tem oriented to data fusion from many different sources [5,11-12,15]. A computer 
system allows for extraction of knowledge about factors affecting occurrence of 
unexpected events and phenomena describing behavior of both a single object and 
a set of items including all interactions among them. This is carried out through 
initial validation, processing and systematization of data in appropriate database 
structures and adaptation of advanced data mining methods (inspired by artificial 
intelligence). Integration of the data describing various phenomena, physical 
quantities and processes in the machines and proper interpretation of the know-
ledge contained in their multidimensional space allow for detection of unknown 
patterns and dependencies, thus, it lead to model the operation process, i.e. deter-
mining the current and forecast future condition of machinery for a given time pe-
riod. The authors are convinced that such a multi-faceted approach might provide 
a wide range of opportunities for appropriate policies to maintain the machinery 
oriented on improving reliability, reducing failures, increase of safety, production 
efficiency, reduction in repair costs, etc.) [13,15-16].

Data Acquisition System and Input Data Description 
The process of monitoring the technical condition of the drive units is based on the 
diagnostic data acquisition using vibroacoustic methods. From the point of view 
of spatial dispersion of the drive units and their amount, it was necessary to build a 
portable module for periodic data acquisition and processing of the vibration data 
in simultaneously with the measurement of the operating load variability. A 
scheme of the data acquisition module is consisted of two parts: (a) laptop acting 
as the control and measurement manager and (b) sensors’ layer, i.e. accelerome-
ters and tachometers. Measurements are performed on the drive unit operating un-
der external load. The conveyor load is expressed via input shaft rotation speed 
determined by the tachometric signal. Vibration data measurement takes into ac-
count technical configuration of the analyzed object [13,15-16]. Fig. 1 presents a 
general scheme of an exemplary arrangement of sensors. 
 
Fig. 1 Diagram of the vibration data acquisition module with an exemplary arrangement  
of the measurement points. The measuring module consists of a portable computer and  
sensors. 
Raw signals acquired this way are segmented and spectral analysis of them are 
performed to determine the diagnostic features. Such processing leads to data of 
average rotational speeds and diagnostic features DF1, DF2 and DF3 related to 
condition of shafts, gearwheels and bearings. Frequency sampling of measure-
ments of a single diagnostic feature is 1 Hz. Length of the measurement is 60 s. 3 
channels of data acquisition are used for measuring each single diagnostic feature. 
Also a tachometric signal is measured simultaneously. Fig. 2 presents an exem-
plary measurement of operational load and the diagnostic feature. As mentioned 
above, we acquire diagnostic data from all drive units consisting the machinery 
park with different technical configuration. Therefore, it is necessary to categorize 
the data with respect to the type of a gearbox to determine technical condition of 
their components, i.e. gears, bearings and shafts. Moreover, one gearbox type 

394

usually operates with several types of couplings. Depending on the type of the 
coupling, gearboxes work in different ranges of rotational speed. Therefore, opera-
tional load values measured as the inverse of the rotational speed of gearbox input 
shaft considering all types of couplings is inconsistent. For this reason, additional 
categorize data in relation to type of coupling is reasonable (Fig 3). In further 
analysis diagnostic data from only one gearbox type operating only with fluid 
coupling have been used (gearbox KA-134). Fig. 4 presents input dataset obtained 
from 119 60-second long measurements performed on the same gearbox type.

Methodology of Data Modeling 
In the case of mining machinery such as belt conveyors diagnostic decision mak-
ing based on the spectrum of a single signal might lead to uncertainties due to 
presence of numerous disturbances in these complex systems. Thus, it might be 
useful to take advantage of a large set of measurements and statistical analysis 
performed for determining basic parameters of the set [1]. 
Statistical approach for bistate pattern recognition (normal state – abnormal 
state) is based on the probability density function estimating for a particular diag-
nostic feature for both states. Then, the alarm threshold is determined, see Fig. 5a. 
Unfortunately, in particular cases it is impossible to distinguish between two states 
because they are overlapping, Fig. 5b. The problem of overlapping of the proba-
bility density functions is often related to a strong dependency between spectrum-
based diagnostic features and operational load of the machine. For this reason it is 
proposed to take into account operational conditions in which the measurements 
has been performed [3-4,9]. 
In the considered case it is needed to determine two thresholds, for warning and 
alarm level of the diagnostic feature (Fig. 5c) which makes the decision making 
process even more complicated.  
In this paper, determining of the thresholds is based on modeling of the distri-
bution of diagnostic features and analysis of volatility of their statistical parame-
ters. The final thresholds are the result of multidimensional clustering of the data, 
i.e. parameters of the distributions and volatility of operating conditions.

overlapping probability density functions of diagnostic features (considered in the paper). 
Fig. 6 presents empirical probability density functions of every measurement. 
Empirical PDF has been estimated by using the kernel density estimator with 
Gaussian kernel [14]. As it was expected, indication of 3 separated group is im-
possible, because the densities are overlapping each other.

Fig. 6 Empirical probability density functions of DF2 feature for 119 measurements per-
formed on the gears type KA-134. The presence of overlapping effect of empirical density 
makes indication of three separated states impossible.  
Firstly, each one measurement is assumed to be normally distributed, thus em-
pirical mean and standard deviation fully describe the distribution of the diagnos-
tic feature DF2. Moreover, empirical mean and standard deviation of input shaft 
rotation speed are calculated. In this case we also assume Gaussian distribution. 
Finally, we obtain a dataset which might be represented as a matrix with 4 rows 
and 119 columns, related to 4 statistical parameters and 119 measurements, re-
spectively, Fig. 7. This dataset was subjected to clustering. 
We use k-means algorithm for data clustering because of observed overlapping 
effects of density functions and ability to use a larger number of parameters. It 
starts with dividing the whole dataset into a given number of classes. Then the

partition is being changed to obtain minimal within-class variance. This method is 
used for preliminary data analysis. The method allows for separation of groups 
which are subjected for further statistical analysis. K-means algorithm might be 
also used for data mining, where grouping is used for separation of the analyzed 
factors into subsets. In general, k-means is used for searching of information and 
its main task is to provide simple access to the information [6-7,10]. 
Performed analysis resulted in constituting constant, load-independent warning 
threshold of DF2 more than 610 and less than 1100 and alarm threshold more than 
1100. Results of the method applied to the measurements are presented in Fig. 8.

Recall that in the model Gaussian distribution of features is assumed. This as-
sumption is a common one in the literature. In the next step we verify the assump-
tion and try to fit a better distribution to the dataset. After that, the new set of  
parameters is subjected to clustering. After insightful analysis the assumption of 
Gaussian distribution of diagnostic features has been rejected. The reason for that 
is a power law of tails. It means that the complementary cumulative distribution

Because the power law in tail is observed we propose to fit a theoretical distri-
bution with tail which also follows the power law. Moreover, values of the mea-
surement are nonnegative, thus we propose to fit the Pareto distribution to the da-
ta. The probability density function of the Pareto distribution is:

The Pareto distribution might be applied to many phenomena, e.g. insurance ma-
thematics and manufacturing process management [8].  
For each of 119 measurements we estimate parameters α  and λ  the using max-
imum likelihood method (MLE). Similarly to the previous case, a new set of para-
meters has been determined and subjected to clustering. Mean and standard devia-
tion of the diagnostic feature measurements have been substituted by α  and λ . μ  
and σ  of rotational speed remained unchanged. It is worth mentioning that distribu-
tion of the rotational speed measurements do not follow a power law, thus there is 
no need to characterize them by parameters other than mean and standard deviation.

In the next step, a multidimensional clustering has been performed in order to 
group the dataset by using the k-means algorithm. In 47 of 119 cases the results 
are different from those obtained in the previous analysis, where mean and stan-
dard deviation of the diagnostic feature DF2 are used for clustering. The current 
result, where

the concept of constant DF2 values thresholds through the whole spectrum of rota-
tional speed. The k-means clustering procedure output is consisted of 5 clusters. 
Next, according to [1], we fit a regression lines to each cluster and merge similar 
ones to determine three condition states e.g. good condition, warning and bad 
condition, Fig. 11.

Conclusions 
In this paper the problem of decision thresholds for belt conveyor driving units 
maintenance is analyzed. Statistical modeling of the diagnostic data has been per-
formed. Appropriate maintenance of the transportation system requires determin-
ing of decision making rules – thresholds of diagnostic features. We extended the 
previous approach which relies on constant thresholds through the whole rotation-
al speed spectrum. Results of our methodology are consistent with those obtained 
in [1], where the level of diagnostic features depends on rotational speed. This de-
pendency results in overlapping of density functions for every measurement, thus 
we considered another description of probability distribution. This description is 
based on the remark that the distribution of diagnostic feature DF2 is not Gaussian 
– it follows a power law and the Pareto distribution is much better in this case.

401
 
Parameters of the Pareto distribution for diagnostic feature DF2 and Gaussian pa-
rameters for rotational speed were estimated and their thresholds were determined 
using the clustering algorithm. Moreover, the clustering algorithm (k-means) does 
not depend on the distribution of the clustered data, thus one can benefit from it 
even in cases where data does not follow the Gaussian distribution.

Low Rank Coal: Future Energy Source  
in Indonesia 
Tri Winarno and Carsten Drebenstedt 
Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany 
Abstract. World energy grow from year to years. Indonesia, with a population of 
240 million, GDP growth rate of 6.23% (2012), estimated final energy demand in 
2025 will be reach 2,043 Million BOE (Barrel Oil Equivalent). This requirement 
when calculated using assumptions on Master Plan of the Acceleration and 
Expansion (Development) of Indonesia (in Indonesia abbreviated as MP3EI) 
2011-2025, the energy demand will reach 2,772 Million BOE. 
Oil production decline every year, and Indonesia became oil importer country.  
In gas sector, prediction from 2019 Indonesia will become importer of gas, and in 
2030 the deficit of gas will be reach approximate 640 Million BOE (BPPT, 2013).  
Based on data from the Geological Agency of Indonesia (2011), Indonesia total 
reserves of  coal approximate  28 Billion tons of very high (> 7100 kcal/kg) 231 
Mt (Million tons), high (6100-7100 kcal/kg) 1,655 Mt, medium (5100-6100 
kcal/kg) 16,128 Mt and lower (<5100 kcal/kg) 10,002 Mt.  
Coal production reached 426 Mt (2013), dominated by thermal coal, with 
74.5% of coal for export. Utilization of LRC (low rank coal) is still lacking, due to 
the limited market. Besides that, also due to the location is relatively far from the 
market and have high moisture content (30-55%), so transportation makes LRC 
not economically.  
Domestic coal demand  in the coming years is quite significant. In accordance 
with Presidential Decree no. 5/2006, the role of coal in the energy mix in 2025 
become 33%, with 2% addition to a  liquid coal. LRC utilization in Indonesia is 
still limited, and even many LRC companies are delaying production with market 
reasons. Upgrade (upgrading/drying, coal gasification and coal liquefaction) also 
enables a reduction in emissions from coal combustion. Considering all the 
potential for the development of LRC very open. With some economic calculation 
on investment, making LRC economically profitable and open opportunities for 
domestic use and for export.

Energy Needs 
In 2000 total energy consumption in the world were 69,110 Million BOE energy 
mix were oil 38.75%, natural gas 23.31%, coal 24.55%, nuclear 6.25%, 
hydroelectricity 6.4% and renewable 0.74%. Then, 2012 energy consumption 

404 
T. Winarno and C. Drebenstedt
 
 
became 92,322 Million BOE with mix oil 33.1%, natural gas 23.9%, coal 29.9%, 
nuclear 4.5%, hydroelectricity 6.7% and renewable 1.9% (BP, 2013) 
In Indonesia energy needs increased with the historical average growth of 
3.09% per year from 2000-2010, from 737 million BOE (2000) to 1,012 million 
BOE (2010). In 2011 the final energy to 1,044 million BOE of energy, with 
energy mix : oil 36%, coal 23%, gas 18%, biomass 16% and others 7% (BPPT, 
2013).  
Oil production in Indonesia from year to year show a decline. Starting in 2003, 
Indonesia has become a net importer of oil. In 2012, oil production in Indonesia 
amounted to 974,000 BOPD (barrel oil perday) with  consumption of 1,384,000 
BOPD. In 2008  gas consumption 218 Million BOE became 242 Million BOE in 
2011. It is estimated that this use will continue to increase in the next years, and 
prediction, start from 2019 Indonesia will become importer of gas, and in 2030 the 
deficit of gas reach 640 Million BOE (BPPT, 2013). The production of coal has 
increased each year, in 2013,  22% were used for the domestic demand and the 
rest for export. Most coal production is thermal coal. Export coal is still needed as 
part of the state revenue.  
In 2025 final energy demand estimated will be reach 2,043 Million BOE with 
business as usual scenario (BAU). When calculate using assumptions Master Plan  
of the Acceleration and Expansion (Development) of Indonesia (MP3EI) 2011-
2025, the energy demand will reach 2,772 Million BOE (BPPT, 2012) 
In accordance with Presidential Decree no. 5/2006, the role of coal in the 
energy mix in 2025 33%, with 2% addition of liquid coal (in energy mix 2012, 
coal 26%).

Coal Potential 
Indonesia has enough coal potential.  Based on data from the Geological Agency 
of Indonesia (2011), the coal resources approximately 120 Billion tons. Total coal 
reserves are approximately 28 Billion tons. The coal reserves are classified based 
on quality; consisting of a very high quality 231 Mt (million tons) (0.8%), high 
quality 1,655 Mt (5.9%), medium quality 16,128 Mt (57.5%) and low rank quality 
coal 10,002 Mt (35.8%) (see Figure 1). This quality classification based on 
Government Regulation No. 45/2003 on Tariffs Applicable for Non Tax Revenue 
in Energy and Mineral Resources Sector.  
In reserves, Indonesia held 3% of world reserves (28 Billion of  948 Billion 
tons) (EIA, 2008). In terms of world reserves, Indonesia has a 5% low rank coal 
reserves. Indonesian LRC production in 2013 amounted to 35 Mt (of 391 Mt total 
coal production), used for coal blending. 
Although Indonesia has 53% reserves in South Sumatera, but production is 
only 8% total coal production, because of LRC. Otherwise, Kalimantan with 
reserves of 47%, produced 92% (Figure 3).

Current Condition 
Coal production in the last 10 years showed increasing. Coal production grew by 3 
times from 131 Mt in 2004 (95 Mt export and 36 Mt domestic) to 426 Mt in 2013 
(317 Mt of export and 97 Mt domestic) (Figure 3). Most of coal production in 
Indonesia were thermal coal. With production in 2012 and 2013, put the Indonesia 
as the largest exporter of thermal coal in the world. Coal export in Indonesia is a 
part of state revenue.  
Utilization of coal in Indonesia for domestic market still limited and mostly 
used in power plant, cement and others industries. Export market for Indonesian 
coal is Asia. The main coal export destination countries Japan, China and India.  
In Indonesia, most of LRC companies stopped their production because of 
market reason. LRC have some limitation, especially in moisture content. Coal 
with a high moisture content, will have a low calorific value.  
In the world, coal is widely used. Total coal world production in 2011 were 
8,440 Mt, with share of LRC (lignite) 1,130 Mt (EIA, 2014).

Discussion 
So far, Indonesia relies on good thermal coal for domestic purposes (power plans, 
cement industry and other purposes) as well as an export commodity. LRC is still 
very limited as blending for various purposes. In fact, most LRC companies 
delaying production for market reasons. Actually, the reason is not very strong 
because the use of the LRC in the world also increased, e.q. for power plants, 
gasification, liquefaction and other purposes. 
In Act Number  4 year 2009 about Coal and Mineral and Government 
Regulation Number 23 year 2010 about Coal and Mineral Enterprise, the need to 
increase the added value of mining commodities including coal. With 10 Billion 
tons of reserves and the government regulation in the energy mix in 2025, the 
LRC utilization can be optimized.  
Thermal coal could still be maintained as an export commodity, whereas LRC 
can be used for domestic and export. The main problems of  LRC is moisture 
content. This problems can be reduced by Upgrading/ Drying of Coal. Upgraded 
can be used as export commodity, besides domestic consumption. With some 
assumption 1 ton of  LRC (lignite) = 2.053 BOE, in 2025 Indonesia need between 
324 - 445 million ton of LRC for domestic demand.  
Prediction of Indonesia energy needs in 2025 on Table 1. 
More advanced utilization in Indonesia from 2008, when the Government 
announced to change the utilization of kerosene for household gas. By 2015, all 
the gas need to meet domestic demand supplied by domestic production, while gas 
needs in 2030 supplied by domestic gas production, gas imports, as well as CBM. 
Gas imports will reach 640 million BOE, or 25% of the total supply of natural gas. 
Non-conventional gas resources that can be expected other than natural gas is 
CBM (with of 10-11%) and  coal gasification (BPPT, 2013). Synthetic gas from 
coal has the potential to meet the demand in industry sector and power plant.

  **Bisnis as Usual (BAU) 
In 2030, deficit of gas can be with coal gasification. Gasification can be used to 
convert solid coal into a gaseous feedstock, which can be used in a range of other 
products. Gasification produces synthesis gas - syngas, a mixture of mostly carbon 
monoxide and hydrogen. The process can also help with separation and 
sequestration of carbon dioxide (Energy and Earth Resources, 2014). Several LRC 
gasification project have been done in several countries like Germany, America, 
Australia, etc.  
Oil consumption in Indonesia has increased which is not comparable with the 
production, is predicted to continue to rise (see Figure 4). It is estimated that by 
2025 petroleum consumption 408.6 Million BOE (BAU) or 554.4 Million BOE 
(MP3EI).  
 
Fig. 4 Indonesia Oil Production and Consumption (EIA, 2014) 
High oil consumption can be substituted by coal liquefaction. The development 
of synthetic fuel production based on coal was first performed in Germany in the 
1900s using the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process developed by Franz Fisher and 
Hans Tropsch. In 1930, in addition to using the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process, 
was developed also Bergius process for producing synthetic fuel.

Coal liquefaction process can be carried out by means of direct and indirect. In 
indirect coal liquefaction process is converted into a gas and then gas formed is 
further processed into synthetic oil. Indirect liquefaction process has been carried 
out commercially in South Africa since 1956 by SASOL (South African Synthetic 
Oil Ltd). Currently direct coal liquefaction technology developed by the Japanese 
(Brown Coal Liquefaction, BCL) and the United States (Headwaters Technology 
Innovation, HTI). Japan has successfully tested a pilot plant coal liquefaction 
capacity of 50 tons / day in Victoria, Australia. While the United States has built a 
pilot plant capacity of 600 tons / day in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, USA. 
Referring to the President Decree No. plan. 5 years in 2006, and also assuming 
Indonesia's energy consumption in 2025, then there is enough space to utilize the 
LRC as the future of energy in Indonesia. Concern that the use of the LRC would 
require high investment. Construction costs for Upgrading Brown Coal (UBC) 
capacity of 5,000 tons/day (feed coal 7,500 tons/day) requires an investment of 
over US $ 100 million. Investment cost of a commercial coal liquefaction plant, 
quite expensive too, at US $ 1.5 billion for the refinery of 13,500 BOPD and could 
reach US $ 2.1 billion for the refinery with a capacity of 27,000 BOPD.  
To assess the investment in these activities, can be used several criteria, such as 
Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Benefit Cost Ratio (BC 
Ratio) and Payback Period. This analysis can be done separately or together. 
Additional analysis can be performed include analysis of Break Even Point (BEP) 
and the Rate of Return on Investment (ROI). In addition is necessary to determine 
the result of changes in production parameters to changes in the performance of 
production to make profit by sensitivity analysis. By sensitivity analyzing the 
possible consequences of such changes can be known and anticipate.The purpose 
of everything is to assess the feasibility of a project / investment.

Conclusions  
1. Indonesian coal production, mostly thermal coal continues to rise, with 
74.5% for export, making Indonesia as the largest thermal coal exporter 
in the world.  
2. On the energy consumption side, especially petroleum, imports grew at 
this time while domestic oil production continues to decline. Gas 
production is sufficient for domestic purposes, but is estimated  2019 
Indonesia  becomes gas importer. 
3. LRC utilization is still limited, with a reserve of more than 10 Billion 
tons can be optimized by upgrading / drying, gasification and 
liquefaction to meet the ever-increasing energy consumption.  
4. Investment and high risk on upgrading / drying, gasification and 
liquefaction require economic calculation including calculation of 
sensitivity analysis.  into account a range of possible changes that will 
occur expected to result in optimal benefits for these activities.

Abstract. The paper deals with impact of surface cost on lignite mining project. 
Not only profitability is discussed but also relations between land owners and a 
Mine Company. Land acquisition is analyzed and statistics are presented. Surface 
cost as term is introduced. Investigations are conducted on real data obtained from 
an already closed pit. Geological data is processed and economic block model is 
built. Lignite quality parameters are estimated with the use of kriging. Surface cost 
map of deposit area is generated as average measures for purchase/sale of real 
estate transactions. Ultimate pits with the use of Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm are 
generated and results are discussed. Additional spatial relation as increase in 
required land area for operation due to ultimate pits cases is shown. Time factor in 
land buyout is discussed. Over or underestimating surface cost may have 
significant impact on viability of lignite mining project.

Introduction 
Mineral rights, the legal rights to exploit and enjoy the benefits of extraction of 
minerals located below the surface as country specific issue are subject to 
government control around the world. Following the Polish law, mineral rights are 
automatically granted to land owner if only these minerals are not listed in Polish 
Geology and Mining Act (since 2011) like sand and gravel deposits. Otherwise a 
concession must be granted. Due to the Polish Geology and Mining Act granting 
concession for extractive activities to proponent in case of lignite deposits does 
not require land ownership essential for commencement of operation. There are no 
straight acquisition regulations so in the event of any legal dispute between land 
owners and mining or energy company, parties should go to court.  
Surface costs, considered as costs of land acquisition and management, 
mine/milling site clearing, payment of ownership, taxes, costs of reclamation and 
giving or selling land back to previous owners or government, in developed 
countries became an important topic because of rising costs of land acquisition

due to urban area density growth, increasing value of real properties, rising taxes 
and costs of fulfillment of environmental regulations. 
In mineral assets valuation three main approaches are used. The Market 
Approach, the Income Approach and the Cost Approach. Within each approach 
there are various methods that have evolved and that are used in different markets. 
In 2005 the IVSC (International Valuation Standards Council) issued Guidance 
Note 14, Valuation of Properties in the Extractive Industries but it was withdrawn 
in 2010 by the IVSB [1] (International Valuation Standard Board) but there are 
attempts for new regulation to be developed. Mineral assets valuations are 
subjected to national valuation codes such as: VALMIN Code, CIMVal Code, 
SAMCODE. In 2008, POLVAL Code - the Polish Code for Mineral Assets 
Valuation based upon world’s best practice was developed in which Fair Market 
Value of mineral assets is introduced. The Income Approach uses indirect measure 
of the market value taking into account future income that can be derived from the 
mineral assets over its entire economic life. Integrated General Approach for 
mineral assets valuation suggests application of Discounted Cash Flow analysis 
for projects that are expected to be economically viable. However still there is a 
problem regarding time factor in commencement of operation. If the project is not 
expected to be economically viable or time factor is included, IGA (Integrated 
General Approach) recommends using ROA - Real Option Analysis with e.g. an 
Option to Delay. Because of ability to choose proper time for commencement 
NPV of mining project is increased by decision elasticity bonus [2]. ROA 
approach will be a subject of separate studies. 
The aim of research presented include impact of surface costs on profitability 
of mining opencast lignite project treated as the investment of vertically integrated 
tandems of a lignite mine and a power plant. To illustrate surface costs scale it is 
worth to mention that Mine Company from the beginning of its operation has 
bought about 133 Mm2 of lands and sold or gave back about 81 Mm2 what gives 
about 52 Mm2 in current disposition. With high fixed costs optimal surface costs 
management became very important issue to sustain profitability of lignite based 
energy projects.

Surface Cost Identification through Mine Project 
Valuation 
Mineral asset valuation is often a team effort. This paper focuses on isolating 
surface cost from mining opencast lignite project and measures its impact. 
Checklist of required data for valuation purposes depends upon approach chosen, 
nevertheless in sales comparison approach this dataset may look as follows [3]: 
Agreement/transaction date, Buyer/acquirer’s name, Effective date of 
appraisal, Price paid per unit, (average) product price at agreement/transaction 
date, Long-term product price expected at agreement date, (Long-term) product 
price at effective date of appraisal, Minority interest, Project development status, 
Deposit grade, Deposit/project size, Property control and security of tenure, 

Impact of Surface Cost on Lignite Mining Project

Capital investment requirement, Operating cost/net operating income, Production 
loss/recovery/metallurgical complexity, Product quality, Product market stability, 
Discovery and expansion potential, Location and access, Infrastructure, Permitting 
issues, Reclamation, Country risk, Project risk, Taxes, royalties, levies. 
There are other approaches that may be used for valuation purposes but careful 
cash flow calculation for individual project still remains a key. For cash flow 
analysis following steps should be considered [4].  
 
a) Calculation of daily production 
rate for ore, waste and production 
schedule.  
b) Main mine equipment selection 
and production rate for each type 
of equipment estimation. 
c) Supplementary equipment 
selection. 
d) Number of production and 
support employees required. 
e) Calculation of owning and 
operating cost for the equipment. 
 
f) 
Calculation of other costs 
g) Overall cost per tonne 
calculation. 
h) Capital cost and the ownership

determination.

While developing geological reserves one may give into consideration many 
possible opencast mining scenarios from which all have impact on the surface. 
The influence of lignite base price on the size of ultimate pit (lignite supply) and 
decrease of lignite quality (decrease of calorific value and increase of sulphur and 
ash content) has already been analyzed [5]. 
Additional analysis regarding surface cost and ultimate pit size will be 
conducted. 
Considering overlaying parcels as mineral property implicates fact that it refers 
to a property that contains a mineral deposit of such quantity and quality that it is 
profitable for extraction as highest and best land use [6]. 
For the cost estimation purposes in mining projects land acquisition may be 
significant as well. Without legal acquisition rules all transactions should be taken 
under free market conditions. By law, mineral deposit (like cooper, lignite and 
other) listed in Polish Geology and Mining Act (from 2011) are not a part of real 
estate in terms of ownership and should not have influence on its value, which is 
arguable. Land parcels that include sand and gravel mineral rights were 
investigated with Comparable Sales Approach use in Wroclaw County considered 
as local market in Poland. Estimated price per 1m2 of those mineral rights (as 
possible mining land use) was compared to agricultural lands and vacant lots for 
residential use. In first case sand and gravel mineral property price was approx. 

414 
M.W. Dudek et al.
 
 
200% of agricultural lands price, whereas it was only 23% of vacant lots for 
residential use price [7].  
Some mineral property valuation used in real estate appraisals in Poland 
reflects methodology used in mining projects [8].  
With the difference that Cost Approach is not well developed in comparison to 
mining project valuation where Cost Approach may be applicable to Mineral 
Assets at prospecting stage or at scaling down and closure [9]. 
Surface cost is not limited only to acquisition. Additional surface cost might be 
mine site clearing and property taxes. Mine site clearing (clearing land from trees, 
plants, topsoil) and access roads costs may be expressed as a function of Tp – tons 
of ore and waste mined per day (by O`Hara & Suboleski, 1992, found in [4]).

Applied to mining industry this number is only rough estimate. It does not 
include trees removal and other services though some general conclusions can be 
made.

Closure and Reclamation Cost 
It is believed that legal condition in the scope of mine closure and post-mining 
land reclamation are unsatisfactory [10]. 
Closure and reclamation fund must be created and not less than 10% of the 
required exploitation charge shall be allocated. Entrepreneurs in Poland are 
obligated to pay operating fees. Royalty rate for lignite is 1.66 PLN/Mg [11].  
Average measures for purchase/sale transactions of lands and buildings in Mine 
Company area (Province) are expressed in following tables as two time frames 
2005 and 2012 year. 
Table 1 Polish Real Estate Turnover in 2005 (Province of Mine area) [12] 
 
Table 2 Purchase/sale transactions of properties built up with residential buildings in 2012 
[13] 
 
Real Estate Tax as surface cost is also a subject of optimization. Lignite deposit 
may have area of 7 630 000 m2. Assuming Land Tax for business purposes 
approx. 0.79-0.85 PLN/m2 may give annually 6.4 million PLN. 
Other surface cost may vary worldwide. Building and development may be 
treated as sunk cost. In United States special tax consideration for depletion of 
deposit is given [4].

While developing mineral project valuation useful cost information may be 
derived from many costs reference guides. For an instance acquisition as surface 
cost – (Canadian Exploration Expense) may be fully deducted in the year incurred 
to the extent of income from any source for the corporation. Any balance not 
currently deductible may be carried forward indefinitely in a pool called the 
Cumulative Canadian Exploration Expense (CCEE) pool. Alternatively, 
exploration expenses may be transferred through “flow-through-shares” that are a

means of obtaining financing for mining exploration and development in Canada 
by sale of the right to claim the specific expenditures as a tax deduction.  Money 
received from sale of “flow-through-shares” is considered as capital gain from 
half of which is taxable as income [14].

Opencast Lignite Mine Case 
Investigation of impact of surface cost on mining opencast lignite project was 
conducted on existing data collected from already closed pit. For the multi-pit 
Mine Company it is crucial to choose best possible scenario based upon variant 
analysis for cost optimization.  
Collected data can be divided into three parts: geology, financial information 
and land management. Cost structure from 17 years of operation (1995 - 2011) 
was analyzed. Several changes of lignite production unit cost, total production 
cost, revenue and production rate were observed.

Block Model Development 
While building block model David (1977) claims that the size of blocks should not 
be less than ¼ of average drilling interval. Currently lack of computing power is 
hardly an issue. One may consider blocks no smaller then the selected mining unit 
[4]. The smaller the blocks the error may increase [15]. 
Based on 2558 drillholes, deposit parameters were estimated with the use of 
ordinary kriging (ISATIS by Geovariances) and interpolated into the structural 
block model (CAE Mining Studio). Investigated lignite deposit has stripping ratio 
6.9. Deposit quality parameters such as ash and sulphur content and calorific value 
were integrated into one Quality Index that differentiates lignite quality while the  
base price for the standard quality lignite is set to 57.65 PLN/Mg (later 
80 PLN/Mg from which previous base price 57.65 PLN/Mg is equal approx. to 
70% of new base price). The block model consists of overburden and lignite 
blocks with the prototype block size 50x50x5 m, whereas the deposit block size 
was 25x25x1 m. For further processing of the quality block model NPV Scheduler 
software was used. Mining cost 4 PLN/m3, discount rate 8% (without inflation) 
and the general slope angle 15o as well as the surface costs map as real estate price 
layer were applied. Basing upon the created economic block model, four ultimate 
pits (phases) were generated with the use of Lerchs - Grossmann algorithm with 
10% of lignite base price incremental change (70-100%).

Land Acquisition 
Land acquisitions follow established Mine Company regulations. Buyout and land 
price negotiation usually starts 3 years before pit advancing. Actual land use  
regarding agricultural activities does not necessarily follow Land and Buildings 
Registration. To focus on surface cost impact, area of interest was divided into 
three main forms of land use nearby deposit area: residential, agricultural-
residential and agricultural and then price map of Mine area was estimated. 
Estimation was conducted with Polish Real Estate Turnover In 2012, Statistical 
Information and Elaborations use. It is an objective statistical data based upon 
Notarial Acts and includes average measures for purchase/sale transactions of 
lands and buildings in Mine Company area (Province) selected for this research. 
This model is quite simple but misses many over estimations and subjectivity 
made by other researchers.

Land Buyout 
For this research 23 cases of land buyout were investigated between years 1993 – 
2004. Each negotiation was followed by competent person (appraiser) valuation 
report to estimate market value and then Mine Company made an offer to land 
owner.

Fig. 3 Ratio (%) of transaction price to estimated value from valuation report of each 
property (one transaction - one bar) mean = 158%. 
Sometimes owners agreed to close to market value price but in few cases there 
were court cases and counter valuation reports. For few transactions it took longer 
than 3 years to accomplish. As a rule that could be seen Mine Company and 
owners started to negotiate from different positions and tend to meet in the middle. 
In many cases nearly 150% of first valuation report contract was agreed (Fig. 3).  
Lignite price formula used in estimations is calculated as multiplication of 
lignite base price and the Quality Index (QI). Values of the standard coal are set 
usually as average values for which the parameters of power plant burners have 
been adjusted [16]. Price formula used by Mining Company is expressed by 
following equation.

Two scenarios were investigated. First case - market value estimated of surface 
cost map and second case - surface cost map model multiplied by 2.5 as for 
extreme cases. In the second case pits were not generated due to high surface cost. 
In the first case four ultimate pits with 10% increment of the base lignite price 
were generated. To meet market value based surface cost, lignite base price was 
set to 80 PLN/Mg although ultimate pit 1 with base price of 70% represents 
original lignite base price (57.65 PLN/Mg).

Conclusions 
Assuming the 8% discount rate few conclusions can be made. Required pit area 
for the mining operation depending on ultimate pit case (1-4) is estimated to be 
approx. 5 800, 6 300, 7 100 and 7 500 thous. m2.

Impact of Surface Cost on Lignite Mining Project

One may consider if it is better to purchase all mining lands at once or with pit 
advancing. Without any special Tax consideration it is better to proceed with 
progressive land buyout. Two scenarios compared indicated that buying lands at 
the beginning of operation may lead to extra expenditures regarding Taxes. Ratio 
of surface cost paid at the beginning to progressive buyout is estimated to be 
approx. 1.57. 
As expected, overestimation of surface costs (more than 2.5 times than 
estimated market value) did not generate ultimate pits. Surface cost may be 
decreased by granting shares of Mine Company to land owners in exchange for 
land/mineral rights (even if deposit below the surface is not a legal part of real 
estate owner but postponing may undermine mining project). 
Transaction data compared to Mine Company negotiation reports showed the 
advantage that land owners have over the Mine Company. Without any clear 
buyout regulation such situation will not change. The average free market 
transaction price was nearly 150% of first valuation report. It is important to 
notice that only 23 transaction data from 1993-2004 were analyzed. It can be 
observed (fig. 3.) that distribution in time is quite even and may suggest that 
progressive buyout did not generate progressive land prices (though 150% is high 
ratio itself), however more research will be conducted to support or discard this 
statement. Granting lands to Mine Company (then government owned) at low 
price from Country Agricultural Office as not market transactions were not taken 
into account.  
As shown in fig. 6. Achieving one million NPV increase in pit 4 compared to 
pit 3 will require investment of 15 million PLN in land and also 400 000 m2 to 
proceed with operation. Such low NPV should raise the question whether the 
lignite project is economically viable, not to mention unexpected stops that 
generates additional costs. Despite of the economic issue this example shows that 
careful surface cost analysis regarding land may lead to social, environmental 
protection and sustainable land development consideration. 
Implementation of the Lerch-Grossmann pit optimization algorithm for the 
surface mining projects allows to evaluate optional scenarios of the pit size with 
regard to both mining and surface costs.

Abstract. Selection of the optimal variant for opening and development of the 
opencast mine is based on the organized, systematized and fundamental research 
of different natural, technical and economic mining project determinants. This is 
necessary but not sufficient condition for successful implementation of the mining 
projects. Mining capital projects, such as are the opening of new opencast mines, 
are very complex due to the influence of a number of internal and external tech-
nical, technological, economic and natural factors and the limitations resulting 
from the natural deposit conditions as well as from the socio - economic environ-
ment. Environment of the project for the opening of the opencast coal mine Radl-
jevo is very complex and involves a series of deterministic and stochastic 
processes. In order to manage efficiently and effectively the project, it is necessary 
to synthesize a large number of skills, tools and techniques in the project man-
agement development plan, which is ensured by a good project management, 
achieving a better project results. 
Keywords: project management, mining project, optimal variant, environment of 
the project.

Introduction  
As a rule, mining companies by investment in capital mining projects implements 
previously defined growth targets, development policies, and business strategies. 
Investment projects in mining are capital since it spend large financial resources, 
significant resources and are long lasting. Investing in the projects the company 
undertakes to affirm the new business environment, adapt to anticipated changes, 
overcome handicaps of current position, or adjust its production capabilities with 
the opportunities offered by the market. All this shows that the investment in capi-
tal projects is condition for existence, sustainable growth and the acquisition of 
mining companies competitive advantages.

However, investment in capital mining projects is a very complex process con-
sisting of multivariate investigation activities of all relevant determinants for fu-
ture conditions and changes that the project entails. Bearing in mind that projects 
for opening of new coalmines, operating within the Electric Power Industry of 
Serbia, are connected with its strategic development goals, in the implementation 
of such projects it has to be taken into account all internal and external factors of 
development and a number of constraints arising from the socio-economic  
environment. 
Selection of the optimal variants for the opening and development of the open-
cast mine is based on an organized, systematized and fundamental studies of dif-
ferent natural, technical and economic determinants of the mining project. This is 
a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful implementation of the min-
ing project. High quality investment projects can be successfully implemented 
only if the project implementation process is managed and the process is by design 
methodology organized. Using the methodology for project management is a 
business strategy that allows maximizing the value of the project by the  
organization [1]. 
A good methodology contains all the important processes of project manage-
ment, and subject involved in the process continue to spread further [3]. Characte-
ristics of a good methodology are necessary level of details, the use of quality 
basic data and standardized techniques for planning, time determination, cost con-
trol and reporting forms. In addition, one should be flexible and reasonable in the 
application and based on standardized phases of the project life cycle. 
In contrast to the accepted methodology that represent the best practice and is 
basically a framework for the model implementation building management of the 
mining project, the model itself should be developed specifically for a particular 
project. This is very important considering the specifics that these projects have 
relating to the location predisposition, the impact on the population and the  
environment, a long time frame and large investments.

Analysis of the Opencast Mine Radljevo Mining Project  
in the Function of the Proces Model Developmen for the 
Project Management 
The strategic and development plans of the Electric Power Industry of Serbia en-
visage the construction of new thermal capacities, which requires the provision of 
a new quantity of coal. The Pre-Feasibility Study: Study on the Selection of  
Limitation and Opening of Opencast Mines South Field and Radljevo with Com-
parative Overview of Technical and Economic Aspects of Coal Mining for the 
Selection of Priority Coal Supplier of CHP Kolubara B [9], it was concluded that 
the opencast Radljevo with production of 13 million tons per year is a priority for 
the further development of new capacities in coal mining in Kolubara coal basin. 

Project Management Model for Opening of the Opencast Mine Radljevo 
427
 
 
Considering the findings of preliminary feasibility study for the opencast mine 
Radljevo it was developed a Feasibility Study with Preliminary Coal Mining De-
sign at opencast mine Radljevo [9], where are determined geological, hydro-
geological, technological, environmental and economic parameters of coal mining.  
This document stipulates that the coal mining and overburden removal is to be 
performed by continuous systems with large bucket wheel excavators. The total 
weights to be mined from the opencast mine Radljevo amounts to 1.7688 bcm, 
from which 1.385 m is solid cubic meters of waste consisting of overburden, in-
terburden, interlayers, and 449 m tons of regular and low-quality coal. Figure 1 
shows a general overview map of the Kolubara coal basin and the location of 
Radljevo deposit. 
 
Fig. 1 Overview map of the Kolubara coal basin with the location of Radljevo deposit (18) 
Annual production capacity of the opencast mine Radljevo is designed at 13 m 
tons of coal. According to the ToR annual capacity of the mine in the first phase 
will be limited to 7 million tons. In relation to the Feasibility Study, opencast mine 
opening is dynamically moved for two years, so that instead of in the year 2014 
the opening starts in the year 2016, and coal production in the second year of op-
eration (in the 2017) should be 3 million tons. The production capacity of 7 mil-
lion is to be made in the year 2019. The second stage of the designed annual coal 
production with capacity of 13 million tons will be achieved in the year 2022. 
Opencast mine opening begins along the western border of the Tamnava West 
Field. In the first phase of mining the opencast mine is developed in parallel to the 
west, and then in the radial direction. Such opencast mine development provides 
long-term stable conditions of the system shifting devices, and initial parallel 
opencast mine opening provides gradual relocation of the village Radljevo parts. 
In the initial period overburden and interlayers material will be dumped on the 
inside dumping sites of the opencast mines Tamnava-East and Tamnava West 
Field. Since the year 2022/23 onwards, all the material will be dumped on the 
outside dumping site of the opencast mine Radljevo.  
For overburden removal will be used two bucket wheel excavators (type 6800 
lcm/h) with a belt bench conveyor system and belt width of 2 m. Selective mining 

428

of coal and interburden is planned to be carried out with up to five bucket wheel 
excavators (type 4500 lcm/h) with a separate belt conveyors of 1.6 m width. By 
the year 2022 in operation are to be used two bucket wheel excavators 4500 on the 
first and second coal bench, from the year 2022 onwards three units, from the year 
2029 four, and from the year 2031 five excavator units. 
Requirements for selective mining have been analyzed, too. Calculation of 
bucket wheel excavators’ capacity on coal is carried out for different blocks and 
conditions of the site face during selective mining, which resulted when sizing 
equipment with reduced equipment utilization coefficient and increased capacity 
reserve. 
For the hydro geological conditions are carried out detailed explorations and 
designed dewatering system comprising a drainage wells with submersible pumps.  
It has been identified and preliminarily designed required infrastructure facili-
ties in the opencast mine.  
The impact of the planned mining activities on the environment has been ana-
lysed and planned measures to reduce negative impacts.  
Special attention is given to the issue of population and public infrastructure d 
resettlement. Total investments for the resettlement of people and public infra-
structure are €170 million over the life of the project, of which €85 million are till 
the year 2020.  
On the opencast mine Radljevo is to be directly engaged up to 1,800 em-
ployees, which has a positive impact on the employment situation in the region. 
Based on the opencast mine preliminary design it have been identified and 
listed required investments per years. Total investment cost for the main and aux-
iliary equipment to be procured until the year 2022 and reaching its full produc-
tion capacity are approximately €360 million. The investment costs for infrastruc-
ture and facilities in the opencast mine, for the same period are estimated at 
around €127 million. Total investment cost until the year 2022 was estimated at 
€487 million. 
Regarding the implementation of this project, it is indisputably a major chal-
lenge in terms of meeting short-term plan by the beginning of mining operations. 
By this analysis it is evident all the complexity and multidisciplinary nature 
of the Radljevo project, ranging from continued intensive geological, hydro-
geological, geotechnical, mining, technological, environmental and other re-
searches, elaboration of studies and technical documentation in the fields of 
geology, mining, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engi-
neering, IT technology, resettlement, procurement of different types of servic-
es and main and auxiliary equipment for the mine up to the performance of 
works at the opening and development of the opencast mine. Despite the delay 
in relation to the timeline of the project implementation, the fact is that ac-
cording to the time schedule provided by the Feasibility Study, time for open-
ing and opencast mine development up to achieving the full capacity is limited 
to seven years, and that foreseen budget for the project in this period is €487 
million.

Project Management Model for Opening and Development 
of the Opencast Mine RADLJEVO  
Project management for opening and development of the opencast mine Radljevo 
is characterized by a strategic approach, particularly with regard to the project 
director who assumes a key role as a system integrator, integrating all the required 
processes and knowledge to successful project implementation. In addition, an 
important role is played by the integration of communication and IT services as 
the support of the management process. Thanks to these technologies, project 
management obtains distribution dimension, better coordination and communica-
tion between project teams, remote locations, interested parties and all relevant 
factors within the project. 
Based on the complexity of the project management definition, as well as by its 
very nature, project management methodology involves division to the process 
groups, which are easier to be managed. Process groups of project management 
represents essential, basic processes and can be practically identified with the 
project phases being in reciprocal interaction.  
On the analysis of the project opening and the open pit mine Radljevo devel-
opment up to achieving designed annual capacity of 13 million tons of coal are 
defined process groups (phases) for this project process model management  
determining: 
• Process group for project initiating; 
• Process groups for project planning; 
• Process groups for project implementation; 
• Process group for project control; 
• Process group for project closure. 
Each of the above-mentioned project phases is unique and the iterative cycle 
during which is undertaken integration in order to set each project process in an 
appropriate level and connected with other process to establish coordination. 
Figure 2 shows a model for the project management on the context-level used 
further for development of the process model for the opencast mine Radljevo 
project management.  
Starting phase and corresponding group of basic processes is the identification 
of the need for the implementation of a business idea. Clear and unambiguous 
guidance on the project at this early stage of the project, are formally discuss by 
the feasibility and viability studies, which provide a picture of whether the project 
is feasible and whether it should proceed with its execution. Speaking about the 
project of the opencast mine Radljevo, activities of this phase is virtually com-
plete, and the output from this phase is a verified Feasibility Study with the Con-
ceptual Design of coal mining in the opencast mine Radljevo [9].

Fig. 2 Project management model for the opencast mine Radljevo on the context-level 
From the perspective of the defined model, the opencast mine Radljevo project 
is in the phase of planning, where over the process groups for project planning is 
defined the project scope, are identified all activities relevant to the project im-
plementation and for which is carried out detailed planning in terms of the order 
execution, budget projections, and time required for implementation. In addition 
in this phase is to be done allocation of resources, both human as well as material 
for the execution of each planned project work. During this phase are discussed 
potential risks that may jeopardize the execution of the project, and even lead to 
total failure of the project as well as preventive measures in a function of the risk 
occurrence, then plan communications plan and project quality plan.  
When in question is the status of the project in this stage are define the scope, 
duration and budget of the project. Regarding time, the project began in the 
second half of the year 2014, and ends in the year 2023. As from the diagram in 
Figure 3 can be seen, it has been defined the key items on the project as the start-
ing of the opencast mine opening in the year 2016, then reaching the full capacity 
of 13 million tons of coal in the year 2022, and the project end in the year 2023. In 
the last year of the project generally it should be held administrative activities 
related to the closure of the project. Regarding the scope of the project, it has been 
defined key activities related to the preparation of urbanism planning documents, 
resettlement, additional geological, hydro-geological and geotechnical exploration 
works, the preparation of the main mining project, procurement of basic and aux-
iliary equipment, mining operations of the opencast mine opening up to achieving 
the full capacity. The project budget is practically defined by the Feasibility Study 
with the Conceptual design for coal mining in the opencast mine Radljevo.

Figure 3 provides the extent of the activities of process groups during the 
project duration. Considering that the extent of the project implementation budget 
is in direct function of the volume of activity in time, the illustration in Figure 3 
can be regarded as a presentation review of the budget scope per process groups 
during the project duration. 
 
Fig. 3 The scope of activities and the extent of budget implementation per process groups 
in time and the key points of the opening project for the opencast mine  
During the third phase, the implementation phase, over the corresponding 
process group are implemented the planned activities from the previous phase, 
with regular monitoring and control of performance. Implementation phase re-
quires maximum focus and commitment of the project team in the implementation 
of all planned activities from the previous phase, in order to achieve the desired 
target - the successful completion of the project. 
In the control phase through a defined process groups, is carried out continuous 
monitoring of the planned work execution within the project. During the monitor-
ing is performed monitoring progress, comparing with the time schedule, planned 
material resources, and are perceived the possible deviations from the plan and 
accordingly corrective actions are taken. 
The final phase or the conclusion phase and the associated process group aim 
the formal statement that a result of the project is in line with expectations, in 
terms of quantity and quality, due to which the implementation of the project 
started. Formally, the project at this stage completes its life cycle and it changes to 
the project results exploitation, which is actually a post-project cycle. As a work 
on the project is formally ended, after accepting the results of the project there is 
no more required for the project team.

Strategic, or integrative, project management is made out of the process aimed 
to identify and define of all the processes and activities required to be integrated 
within the project management, as well as their mutual correlation and impact on 
the project itself to be managed (Figure 2). This implies the definition and integra-
tion of process groups of essential, basic processes and auxiliary processes, as 
well, in terms of the project management process model. In this sense, are defined 
out from the described basic the auxiliary project management processes for the 
opening of the opencast mine Radljevo: human resource management, cost man-
agement, quality management, risk management, scope management, and time 
management (Figure 2). 
Time management is aimed to define the time frame of the project, as well as 
the duration of all sub-processes, tasks and works that make the project itself.  
Management by project scope integrates all required activities and tasks needed 
to be made in order to achieve comprehensive implementation of the project as suc-
cessful. Scope of work planning, defining the mutual structure on works, verification 
of scope and scope volume are integral processes of the scope management. 
Quality management is a series of processes that ensure that the project will re-
sult in the required goals both by volume and by the quality. Some of these 
processes are quality planning, providing quality assurance and quality control 
achievement by individual processes, tasks and the project as a whole. 
Human resource management aims to organize and manage the project team as 
a whole. Integral parts are planning of human resources, the creation of a project 
team and management by the project team during project activities. The success of 
the project is, among other things, based on the ability of project managers to ex-
plain to the project team their importance for the achieving the project results. 
Cost management synthesize processes aimed the implementation of the project 
within the foreseen projected budget. The processes in this group are: cost esti-
mates, the types of costs determination and cost control during the implementation 
of project tasks.  
Communications management integrates the processes aimed to generate, select 
and distribute information and data about the project. These processes are com-
munications planning, distribution of information and use of information. 
Risk Management includes the processes aimed to identify, systematize and re-
sponse to risks that may arise in the project and the project environment and ad-
versely affect to the project. Quantitative and qualitative risk analysis, response 
planning to risks, risk consequences, monitoring and control are of some of the 
processes in this group. 
Procurement management - logistics encompasses all the processes of pro-
curement of goods and services required for the project. Procurement planning, 
tenders, selection of suppliers, contracting and immediate implementation of the 
procurement are processes of this group. 
For the successful implementation of the above mentioned project management 
process model for the opening and development of the opencast mine Radljevo, it 
is required by the project manager and project team to possesses a number of

specialized knowledge. In addition to specialized knowledge in the field of mining 
and geology, this project requires specific skills, such as:  
− Technical skills that are specialized for particular industries such as civil engi-
neering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, economics, ecology, 
etc. 
− Knowledge of operational processes management, such as logistics, commercial 
jobs, etc. 
− Knowledge related to state regulations, such as laws, regulations, customs  
regulations, standards, etc.

As each mining project is implemented in almost a specific and unique envi-
ronment for the success of the project is of vital importance the knowledge of the 
environment. Project Manager with the project team during the planning and im-
plementation of the project must necessarily take into account all the specifics of 
the environment, to gather the necessary information in order to integrate the posi-
tive aspects of the project environment, and minimize or eliminate the impact of 
the negative aspects of the environment. A very important aspect of the project 
environment is a cultural and social environment. As the opencast mine Radljevo 
project involves direct interaction with the environment, then it is really important 
how this project affect the environment and vice versa, how the environment af-
fects the project. Aspects of the environment such as economic, environmental, 
demographic, cultural and ethical may have significant implications at the project. 
Based on the preceding analysis is determined the process project management 
model for the opening of the opencast mine Radljevo (Figure 4). The present 
model, in terms of this paper, is sufficient to fully examine the multidisciplinary 
nature and complexity of this mining project implementation. This model as per 
scope and structure is on the context-level and allows defining for each process 
group a complete process model with defined process activities. An additional 
benefit of the developed model is that on its base can be defined procedures for 
the management of individual processes and activities of the project. Integrated 
models and procedures make a system for project management, which to the sig-
nificant extent should to increase the reliability of implementation for the each of 
the planned activities. 
Considering that the project is in the early planning stage, when only are de-
fined scope, time and budget of the project, presented model for the project man-
agement process in Figure 4 is to be the basis for defining of other plans.

Final Considerations 
Opening and development project for the opencast mine Radljevo is multidis-
ciplinary and highly complex project that requires the implementation of com-
plex research as well as development of study and technical documentation in 
the field of spatial planning, resettlement, environment, geology, mining engi-
neering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, IT 
technologies, then the procurement of various types of services as well as the 
main and auxiliary equipment at the mine and in the end the performance of 
works at the opening and development of the opencast mine in order to 
achieve full capacity. In addition, when in question is this project it should not 
be ignored the value of investments till the year 2022 amounting to around 
half a billion of Euros and the environment in which the project will be  
implemented. 
Such complex procedure can be successfully implemented only by applying 
the best practices in the project management. The described project manage-
ment process model for opening and development of the opencast mine Radl-

jevo in order to achieve design capacity is based on the latest knowledge in 
the field of project management and is consistent with the best practices in the 
field of mining projects management. Process model is developed in the in the 
early planning stages of this project and it is required but is not sufficient con-
dition for the successful implementation of this project and it is the basis for 
the development of the opening and development of the opencast mine Radl-
jevo project management. The developed system to manage the project should 
include a complete process model on the required level of details for the each 
process of developed procedures according to the model. Considering that 
investment in capital mining projects is a very complex process composed of 
multidimensional activities of investigation all relevant determinants of future 
conditions and changes that the project carries this project management model 
with process procedures are the basis for the development of project manage-
ment systems, and makes a reliable basis for the efficient and effective open-
ing of the opencast mine Radljevo project implementation.

in Development of Large Ore-and Coalfields

An effective way to reduce unit costs of stripping work is to improve the transport 
scheme and a pit overburden removal method. This is especially important for 
motor transport. Transport expenses dominate in the cost structure of overburden 
removal production processes and can reach up to 60% of the total costs. 
Resolution of this problem by increasing carrying capacity of dump trucks is 
problematic due to the following reasons. Cost of cargo transportation as a result 
of increase in dump trucks capacity becomes lower. However, intense reduction 
takes place for trucks capacity from 40 to 110-130 t (area А, see Fig. 1).

Within a 120-350 t carrying capacity range, rates of reduction in ton-km cost 
sharply decrease (area В, see Fig. 1). 
Conveyer and railway (mains) mode of transport do not react to increase in the 
length of haul so dramatically as the motor transport does. That is why in order to 
reduce costs, associated with transportation, for the purposes of development of 
mines with dipping and steep mineral deposits it is advisable to switch over to a 
combination of a few modes of transport. 
For development of modern quarries, up to three types of transport may be used 
having different cost price for ton-km transportation of rock mass (overburden). 
The biggest prospects for the development of large quarries lie in cyclical–and-
continuous technology (CCT), where motor transport is used as a gathering 
transport, while conveyer is used as the main transport, carrying out the main 
work for lifting of crushed material to the surface. Use of the CCT has the biggest 
efficiency for transportation of ore. This is explained by the fact that in the total 
ore dressing complex, ore reduction is the initial stage of ore treatment, preceding 
subsequent enrichment and conversion. 
As of today, CCT complexes for transportation of overburden rocks are used to 
a lesser extent, which is explained by additional costs for crushing of starting 
material for its subsequent transportation by conveyor transport. 
Despite the fact that capital expenditure for organization of CCT method is 
higher, overall costs are 25-35% lower. The reason for this is that operating costs 
in CCT schemes are twice as small because of reduced need in trucks, drivers and 
technical staff (Fig. 2) [1].

In ore-crushing traffic flows, transfer points (crushing stations) of CCT 
complexes are equipped by primary gyratory cone crushers and Blake sledgers. 
At the first phases of development of CCT complexes (1980-1995), the main 
drawback of crushing stations was that they were “strictly fixed” transfer points at 
stationary edges of open-pit mines. Their transfer (as a result of deepening of 
mining operations) represented a complex engineering and technical problem and 
was economically a very costly process. 
Given an average rate of progress in depth of 10-20 m/year, opencast depth 
increased rapidly, which due to “strictly fixed” points of crushing stations did not 
enable to effectively stabilize the volume of open-cut transport operations for a 
longer period. An undoubted progress in the development of CCT complexes 
became a creation of semi-permanent crushing and transfer units, equipped with 
single-roll, two-roll, screw and hybrid crushers. 
Leaders in creation of screw and toothed-roll, roll and hybrid crushers are 
«MMD», «ThyssenKrupp Fördertechnik», «Joy Global», «Sandvik», «FAM» and 
«FLSmidth». A prototype model of two-roll crusher was manufactured by 
«Tenova TAKRAF». 
Semi-permanent crushing stations, equipped with roll and screw crushers are 
used currently at many quarries of the world. 
Use of single-roll, two-roll and screw (roll-sizer) crushers in CCT complexes is 
a progressive technical solution, ensuring compactness of crushing unit with lower 
energy and metal consumption. 
Screw two-roll crushers process material without use of prescreening (Fig. 3). 
 
 
Fig. 3 Screw and toothed-roll crusher, manufactured by «MMD» 
Configuration of teeth is such that it enables small pieces of rock to spill 
without additional recrushing (overgrinding). Crushing principle is based on 
enhancement of structural defects in material by the crusher’s teeth through tensile 
stresses thereby allowing to control the size of the output piece.  
«Joy Global» manufactures BF-38 and BF-43 single-roll crushers, successfully 
used for primary crushing of rocks. 
For fitting out of semi-permanent crushing units, «Sandvik» is using CR810 
series hybrid crushers. Hybrid crushers combine working principles of traditional 
crushers – sizers (classifiers) and two-roll crushers, which made them suitable for 
primary crushing.

Improvement of excavator-dump truck complexes moves towards increase in 
the capacity of excavator buckets and trucks capacity. Excavators with bucket 
capacity of 50-54 m3 are capable in a stable mode to load up to 2-2,5 mln. m3 and 
with buckets of 28-32 m3 – up to 1-1,5 mln. m3 of rocks per month respectively. 
Use of powerful excavator-truck complexes reduces concentration of mining 
equipment in the open-pit mine and increases the intensity of development of area 
of mining operations. Their use further results in reduction of costs on excavation 
and transfer of overburden rocks. Experience of operation of PС-4000, PC-5500, 
EX-5500, and P&H-2800 machines with bucket capacity of 24-32 m3 show that 
unit costs of excavation of 1 m3 of overburden are reduced by 20-25% compared 
with performance indicators of lower class mining power shovels (Fig.4 ). 
 
 
Fig. 4 Production costs of excavation of 1 m3 of overburden by different types excavators 
A factor, constraining a switch over to mining power shovels with bucket 
capacity of 54-70 m3, operating as part of excavator-dump truck complexes, is the 
motor transport. 
The main problems of working with 360-450 t load class trucks are complicacy 
of design of motor tyres, difficulty in transportation of large parts by railroad and 
need to increase width of auto roads. The latter circumstance leads to an increase in 
the extent of overburden and mining capital works when constructing open-pit 
motor ways in nonworking and working flanks of an opencast. 

Problems and Prospects of Cyclic-and-Continuous Technology  
441
 
That is why «ThyssenKrupp Fцrdertechnik», «Tenova TAKRAF», «Joy 
Global», PJSC «Novokramatorsk machine-building plant», «Metso» and 
«Kleemann» have developed a concept of cyclical–and-continuous technology 
(CCT), using fully mobile crushing stations. Innovation lies in the possibility of 
crushing stations to move during excavation, which enables to fully eliminate 
previously necessary transportation by dump trucks. 
Use of continuously operating machinery compared with cyclically operating 
dump trucks gives an economic effect not only as regards increase in output and 
decrease in transport costs, but also as regards saving of energy costs and 
protection of the environment. 
CCT complexes, using fully mobile crushing stations, include a power shovel, a 
mobile crushing station, an overloader, and a conveyer system [2]. 
However, CCT complexes, using fully mobile crushing stations with big 
capacity are still largely experimental equipment. 
The most promising for use in removing overburden at large coal and ore mines 
in the near 5-7 years CCT complexes, built on the basis of use of semi-mobile 
crushing stations and gathering motor transport. 
A key risk in selecting these CCT complexes is a type of crusher, used in the 
crushing station. Faultless in this respect are jaw and cone crushers, however these 
types of crushers have several-fold higher cost of crushing process compared with 
screw-toothed and toothed roll crushers (table. 1).

An efficient way  controlling performance of a crusher is decrease in the size of 
starting material coming for crushing. This condition can be realized through efficient 
management of preparation of rocks, delivered to crushing stations of CCT complexes. 
Gradation of material entering the CCT complex feed for crushing, is 
determined, on the one hand, by the geological structure of the rock mass (in the 
first place by fracture pattern and mechanical properties), on the other hand, by the 
way the rock is prepared for excavation. 
With standard methods of blasting preparation of sedimentary rocks 
(sandstones, claystones, siltstones, limestones) of coal deposits and of overburden 
rocks of many ore deposits (of different geological origin), up to 70% of material 
(in shotpile) has a fractional composition of 0 - 400 mm. Rocks with this grain 
composition are potentially suitable for transportation by conveyer transport. 
By improving blasting preparation of original rock, one can achieve a fraction 
with size of 0-400 mm (in shotpile) to the extent of 80-85% (Fig. 5). This 
circumstance at the turn of 1980-1990 became the reason for creation of 
experimental and pilot commercial crushing stations of CCN complexes based on 
the primary screening of the original rock [3]. 
 
Fig. 5 Change in the size of granulometric composition of rocks at various ways of their 
preparation for transportation. 1 – change in fractional composition of the original rock for 
crusher feed when standard technology of blasting in used; 2 – change in fractional composition 
of the original rock for crusher feed in optimization of parameters of blasting preparation of

with cutting and loading machine; S1+S2 –original rock crushing , characterized by 
granulometric curve 1; S2 –crushing of original material, characterized by curve 2 
Because of imperfection of grizzly screens, the idea of creation of crushing 
stations, where up to 70-80% of 0-350 mm material fractions (suitable for 
transportation by conveyer transport) is separated by screening process has not 
been fully implemented.

At the same time, the use of single-roll, two-roll, screw-toothed and hybrid 
crushers is a reasonable compromise in the process of preparation of material for 
transportation by conveyor. These crushers effectively pass the original rock of 
fine and medium fractions and, in fact, combine the functions of screening and 
crusher (Fig.6) For the purposes of selecting CCT, it is important to determine 
capacity of crushers, operated as part of crushing stations. 
 
Fig. 6 Fractional composition of rock before and after crushing 
When designing crushing stations of CCT complex for overburden rocks it is 
required to be guided by the principle of "do not crush anything extra» [3]. 
According to this principle, the cost of formation of granulometric composition of 
the initial rock and the actual cost of crushing need to be optimized. 
One of the problems of CCT complexes operating is that during rock blasting in 
a majority of cases it is impossible to reliably eliminate output of coarse fractions 
(>1000 mm) of material delivered for crushing. 
For liquidation of separate oversize pieces of initial rock (by conditions of 
crusher feeding), CCT complexes incorporate hydraulic breakers, capable to 
destroy oversize pieces in the crusher hopper or in the feed hopper. 
In case of systematic getting into composition of original rock of 1200-1500 
mm fractions, it is required to select a roll crusher or a screw-toothed roll crusher 
of a larger class, capable to cope with crushing of material of large fractions. In 
the latter case crushing capacity is underused.

An advanced engineering solution in improving crushing stations seems to be 
the use of feeder-crushers and a scheme of two-phase crushing. 
In the first phase, a feeder-crusher is used, which brings original material 
fractions (0-2000 mm in size) to 0-600 mm fraction (Fig. 7). 
In the second phase, a less powerful crusher processes a stabilized flow of 
original material (0-600 mm) to 0-350 mm fraction, suitable for conveyer 
transporting (see Fig.7).

b) 
 
Fig. 7 Schemes of two-phase crushing using a feeder-crusher. а) scheme includes a grizzley 
screen; b) scheme without a grizzley screen.1 – a feeder-crusher 
Use of two-stage crushing schemes enables to remove part of problems, 
associated with operation of crushing stations with standard design, namely: 
- to reduce capital and operating expenses, associated with operation of large 
crushers; 
- to ensure loading into crusher of original material 1600-2000 mm in size; 
- to ensure synchronous start of the main drive motors with a total capacity of 
over 1000 kW. 
Power consumption of secondary crusher will be several-fold less through 
guaranteed bringing of feed size up to 0-500 mm and reducing share of fractions, 
greater 300 mm. 
An advantage of this technical solution using feeder-crushers is also a 
substantial simplification in the design of the crushing unit. 
The problem in that the civil part of crushing units constructions for dump 
trucks with capacity over 200 t becomes more complicated, since heavy duty 
bearing metalwork is needed in order to cope with dynamic load, arising in the 
course of discharge of dump trucks. The latter circumstance results in significant 
increase in costs for their construction. 

Problems and Prospects of Cyclic-and-Continuous Technology  
445
 
If it is required to transfer crushing stations, then a crusher, a feeder and part of 
metalwork can be easily enough transferred to a new place. However, transfer of 
the building structures (concrete foundations under supporting structures of 
hopper, feeder, crusher, retaining wall etc) is virtually an impossible task.

Analysis-Specific Standardization of Quarries to 
Determine the Potential for the Application of 
Belt Conveyor Systems 
Christian Niemann-Delius and Tobias Braun  
Institute for Surface Mining and Drilling, RTWH Aachen, Germany 
Abstract. With a yearly power consumption of about 1,700,000 MWh, the quarry 
industry appears to be one of the most energy-intensive sectors among German 
industries. In-pit transport operations require approx. 40% of the entire power 
demand, generating some 50% of the total mining costs. To date haulage is mostly 
done by mine trucks, driven by diesel engines with a total annual fuel consump-
tion of 68 million liters, emitting an equivalent of 208,000 tons of carbon dioxide. 
Substitution of the mine trucks by establishing belt conveyors will on the one hand 
significantly reduce the emissions, and on the other increase energy efficiency in 
in-pit transportation. As every open pit requires a specific approach in order to 
find a suitable conveying system, a standardized analysis is not possible. In order 
to achieve a differentiated statement on the suitability of continuous conveyors 
according to various structural properties, a classification and standardization of 
quarries with similar transport parameters has been established. An individual 
scheduling of conveying and machine usage in the different types of quarries will 
allow a comparison of optimized constellations of the different haulage systems 
within the respective field of application, in order to quantify and compare ecolog-
ical and economical aspects among the haulage systems. 
The following paper deals with a standardization of the German quarries. First 
the general quarry information and parameters are to be capture. Secondly the 
restrictions on the application of conveying systems will be argued. Referring on 
the different open-pit types and their characteristics, the results of the standardiza-
tion will be presented. Results will include the prediction of the ecological and 
economical potential of applying continuous haulage systems for the different 
open-pit types in Germany.

Introduction 
In Germany, hard rock mining is almost exclusively done in open-pit mines. Re-
garding an adequate haulage method there is a choice between continuous and 
non-continuous transport techniques. Currently, apart from few exceptions, dis-
continuous methods are being used. This is due to the given transport conditions 
and the general framework regarding the optimal use of transport technologies.

The bulk of open-pit mines where hard rock extraction is done are of comparative-
ly small size. This is also true of the yearly tonnage. Such operational conditions 
basically speak against the use of continuous methods transport because these are 
primarily apt for transport of large masses over long distances. What is more, the 
material to be transported has an improper great size after being loosened from the 
ground mass and has to be reduced or at least size controlled before transportation. 
The economic and technical operational restrictions for continuous handling tech-
niques that limit the operation of belt conveyors almost exclusively to the use in 
loose rock are based on data and experience from the early application of such 
technologies. Technological progress in general and especially the technological 
advance of mobile crusher units in the last two decades have however from an 
engineering point of view expanded the operational range of continuous transport 
techniques and thus created potentials for the use in hard rock mining. The ques-
tion remains whether it is basically economically feasible and if so under which 
operational conditions to use continuous transport techniques in open-pit mines. 
The testing of the hitherto largely unexplored application in the most cost-
intensive processing step in hard rock mining however carries an high economic 
risk since the decision in favour of a transport variant not only involves big in-
vestments but also has repercussions on the design of the open-pit layout, the 
personnel employed and the dimensioning of the corresponding equipment. 
The in-pit transport accounts approx. 50% of total costs and some 40% of the 
total energy consumption in hard rock mining. The total energy consumption in 
hard rock mining amounts to approximately 1.7 MWh/a of which ca. 680.000 
MWh/a go into in-pit haulage [1,2]. This is currently almost exclusively caused by 
diesel-engine dumper trucks, which leads to a yearly consumption of 68 million 
litres of diesel fuel with a fuel value of 9.9972 kWh per litre of diesel fuel, by 
which in turn 208.000 t of CO2 equivalents are emitted. Belt conveyor operations 
however are driven by electrical drives and only have a fifth of the specific energy 
consumption per mined ton compared with dumper trucks [3]. So, CO2 emissions 
in in-pit transport may be reduced by 49.5% by alternatively using belt conveyors 
and can even be completely avoided locally [4]. If the required power is entirely 
generated from renewable energy sources the percentage of emission reduction rises 
to 96% in terms of the current initial value [5]. 
The economic and ecologic potential resulting from the application of conti-
nuous transport techniques primarily depends on the characteristics of the open-pit 
mine and the specific requirements to material extraction [6]. The quantification of 
this potential in terms of the considered area of Germany therefore implies know-
ledge of the underlying structure of the local hard rock mining. The present paper 
the classification and standardization of the German hard rock mines is first de-
scribed in order to approximately quantify the described potential.

Standardization of Quarries with Regard to the Use of 
Different Transport Techniques 
The characteristics of an open-pit mine are influenced by a series of factors. The 
layout is based on e.g. the form and the shape of the deposit and local circums-
tances such as protection of nature or residential areas. Furthermore, in choosing 
an appropriate mining design more factors such as the quality of the rock and the 
requirements of the material to be extracted come into play. The differences be-
tween open-pit mines are partly significant. Regarding the used area there are 
differences of a few hundred thousand square meters. In Germany alone, there are 
more than 1.000 quarries which more or less differ from each other. 
In order to come to a detailed conclusion regarding the fitness for the use of con-
tinuous transport techniques in these open-pit mines, different classes are defined in 
terms of the characteristics of certain features. These are subsequently intentionally 
defined by the representational properties so that a well-arranged amount of standar-
dized open-pit mines of different properties can be used as reference.  
2.1 
Classification 
In order to reduce the large number of quarries, the analysis of a subset or control 
sample is effected. The research is based on a control sample resulting in a control 
sample error of 9% referred to 107 surveyed open-pit mines based on a population 
of 1.500. Since the observation refers to the open-pit mines situated in Germany 
quarries of each region of the country are considered. The distribution is oriented 
towards the federal states concerned where the open-pit mines are located. Thus in 
order to obtain a realistic distribution an amount of quarries is chosen which ap-
proximately corresponds to the percentage share of the open-pit mine distribution 
per federal state based on the basic population (see Figure 1). 
Of the quarries 30% are located in Bavaria. Rhineland-Palatinate, Hessia, 
North-Rhine-Westphalia and Baden Württemberg each have a share of 10%, while 
Thuringia as well as Saxony represents 5%. The other quarries spread over the 
other federal states are in low percentage rates [7]. 
To obtain a pertinent classification of the quarries classification features are ex-
amined which create a relevant grading for the research question and which on the 
other hand are equivalent regarding the contents and the characteristic significance 
[8]. Probably, the most decisive influence on the use of different transport me-
thods in open-pit mines are their areal size and extension and the dependent length 
and layout of the transport routes. As a consequence, the classification is done by 
the areal size of the pit opening and another sub-division is effected by the type of 
mining and the resulting pit design.

For the present research question an amount of 10 classes is considered appro-
priate. As the final number of classes results from the multiplication of the number 
of the variable „type of mining“, whose maximum number with three different 
types of mining is already certain, with the not yet defined number of the variable 
„size levels“ a scale of four size levels is considered sensible. The alternative of a 
scale of 3 size levels is refused because in this way only an insufficient structura-
tion especially regarding the similarity and dissimilarity structures is obtained. 
From a first classification in terms of the similarity/dissimilarity structure the 
following levels result from the size of the open-pit mines: 
• 
open-pit mines smaller than 200.000 m² (K 200) 
• 
open-pit mines smaller than 500.000 m² (K 500) 
• 
open-pit mines smaller than 700.000 m² (K 700) 
• 
open-pit mines greater than 700.000 m² (G 700) 
The characterization of the classes is effected by the arithmetic means of the 
corresponding property value. In Table 1 the property values of the determined 
size levels are shown. The quality of the found values can be determined by the 
variation coefficient, which indicates the relative size in terms of the mean. A 
sufficient characterization of the property values by the mean prerequisites a var-
iation coefficient smaller than 50% [1].

The percentage classification 
of the quarries in the

Table 1 Distribution of German hard rock pit mines according to size levels 
 
 
For a final grouping an amount-dependent distribution of the classes is aimed at. 
The percentage distribution on the different size levels, established by simply count-
ing the observed quarries is further subdivided by the classification of the open-pit 
mines according to the type of mining used in each case. These are arranged as fol-
lows, according to an survey of the Institute for Surface Mining and Drilling of the 
RWTH Aachen from 2008, where 110 hard-rock mines in the Federal Republic of 
Germany were considered: in 44% of the open-pit mines slope and hill mining is 
done, in 28% areal mining and in the other 28% mining to depth. 
From the classification according to the properties size level and type of mining 
results the percentage distribution of the open-pit mines in question over twelve 
classes presented in Figure 2.

2.2 
Standardization 
In order to allow a comparison of the different transport methods regarding their 
fitness for use in hard rock mines with regard to economic feasibility and ecologi-
cal aspects more descriptive features are assigned to the open-pit mine classes. 
Next to the size of the mine opening and the type of mining the gradient of 
the transport ramp is an important factor for the accessibility of the open-pit mine. 
The average difference in level to overcome results from the maximum pit depth 
and the number of bench levels in the open-pit mine. The relevant distance in 
application considerations is the transport distance i.e. the length of the distance 
between the mining operation and the transport reference point. As this constantly 
changes over the lifetime of an open-pit mine the mean distance will be consi-
dered. The required belt length for the use of continuous hauling means is also 
determined by the applied mining method. Since the belt conveyor cannot be easi-
ly moved to another bench level the necessary belt length increases with every 
additional active bench. The different extraction methods are used in German 
hard rock mines in the following frequency distribution: 
 
Fig. 3 Mining operation distribution in German hard rock mines [1] 
In hard rock extraction, simultaneous multiple bench mining plays more or less 
a minor role and is applied in exceptional cases only. That is why considerations 
are limited to single or multiple bench extraction. In considering the extraction 
methods a further sub division of the formed classes is effected by standardization. 
As the standardization primarily refers to the use of continuous transport tech-
niques the most favourable mining design depending on the extraction method is 
selected. In the case of areal extraction, swivel mining, in the case of slope min-
ing, parallel mining and in the case of mining to depth continuously progressing 
expansion mining is examined. The most important characterization point to be 
considered next to the mean transport distance is the yearly haulage tonnage 
which has a decisive influence on the dimensioning of the equipment and the 
development of the mine. For calculation an average bulk density of 1.7 t/m³ is 
considered. 
The calculated feature characteristics are identical for the sub classes and types 
of a size level. Table 2 summarizes the relevant properties and the characteristic 
properties of the individual classes..

Table 2 Characteristic attributes of the individual open-pit mine classes 
 
The sub-division by mining method is reflected in the consideration of the 
slope direction of the ramps, which influences the performance and the energy 
consumption of the means of haulage. In the case of the extraction by drilling, e.g. 
in the loaded state up-hill move and in the unloaded state down-hill move is im-
plied. This mining method is only interesting for the transport by belt because it 
influences the required belt length as mentioned earlier. For the mobile disconti-
nuous haulage changing loading points play a minor role. 
Briefly summarized, from the combination of different extraction methods 
(slope mining (HA), areal mining (FA) and mining to depth (AT)) and different 
extraction procedures (multi-bench extraction (MA) and single floor extraction 
(EA)) result 24 open-pit mine types, which are presented in Table 3. 
Table 3 Sub-divided presentation and naming of the 24 types of open-pit mine 
 
The external shape of the open-pit mines is largely dependent on the mining 
method and is only little influenced by the direction of the mine development. The 
size levels of the standardization have an impact by the bigger or smaller dimen-
sioning of the presented forms and/or a differing length-width relation. The basic 
shape will not be changed by the mining method either because only the number 
of the actively used levels changes. As in here, the mining direction is considered 
as conditioned by the mining method there are three basic shapes of open-pit 
mines, which are presented by screenshots from aerial photo analysis in Figure 4.

questioning of manufacturers. The underlying data base for equipment information 
such as durability, availability, original price and repair costs for different equip-
ment types and sizes is provided by the “Construction equipment list 2007” pub-
lished by the Main Association of the German Construction Industry Registered 
Association. Data on the more exact specification of the equipment in question 
such as speeds, energy consumptions, dimensions, cycle times and behavior under 
various operating conditions are taken off „Specifications & Application Hand-
book“ of „Komatsu” company from 2007 as well as the manufacturer’s leaflets of 
the same company and „Caterpillar“, „Metso Minerals“ und „Kleemann“ compa-
nies. The formulas required to compute performance and cost effectiveness also 
arise from these brochures and the usual relevant literature. 
The calculations the methods comparison is based upon do not include the entire 
costs and energy consumptions caused by the extraction, but only the part that varies 
as different transport techniques are applied. Thus, the results are not apt for the 
analysis of a certain transport but enable a comparison of the transport techniques 
among each other. Table 4 shows an example of the open pit specific analysis. 
Table 4 Comparison of results for the open-pit mine types K 500 EA 
 
 
For this reason, the presentation of the results is not in absolute values but on 
the basis of the percentage deviations of the results among each other under the 
condition that the most advantageous value is set at 100% costs and energy con-
sumption in each case. 
Analysis of the results shows that a continuous transport proves to be the most 
cost effective method in 8 of the 24 mines making up ca. 19% of all German qua-
rries. However, in other cases, too, only marginal cost differences are found com-
pared with the individually most advantageous transport. However, in other cases, 
too, there are marginal cost differences as opposed to the most cost effective 
means of haulage in each case. Presentation of the quarry-specific most cost effec-
tive means of haulage follows in Table 5.

The analysis provides some factors that influence the cost effectiveness of the 
application of continuous haulage. So, e.g., the costs for the pay mineral extraction 
decrease as the yearly haulage tonnage increases. What is more, it becomes evi-
dent that the difference between the operational costs for continuous transport in 
single and multi-bench extraction is significantly higher than in the other transport 
techniques. Regarding the gradient of the transport distance to be covered, the 
situation is reverse: the steeper it becomes, especially when loaded, the lower the 
specific cost for the pay mineral transport compared with the other methods of 
transport. 
Regarding energy consumption, it becomes evident that continuous transport in 
the majority of cases represents the most cost effective haulage alternative. How-
ever areal mining favours the use of dumper trucks operating discontinuously (see 
Table 6).

A sensitivity analysis made in the wake of the result evaluation underlines that in 
some open-pit mine types where the comparison of techniques showed that only 
little cost differences in relation to the most advantageous haulage alternative al-
ready little changes or deviations of the pit parameters “ramp gradient”, “transport 
distance” and “yearly transport tonnage” may lead to cost reductions by the use of 
continuous haulage equipment. If under this aspect open-pits are considered, which 
show a cost difference of less than 10% between the expenses for continuous trans-
port and the expenses for the most advantageous alternative technique in that case a 
potential of cost reductions by continuous transport may arise in 10% of the German 
hard rock mines. If only open-pit mines operating in single bench extraction mode 
are regarded the share even rises to 60% of all single cases.

Summary 
The paper shows that the use of continuous transport techniques in Germany’s 
hard rock open-pits is economically feasible and in some cases is even 
economically advantageous. Based on the results of the comparison of techniques 
and sensitivity analysis it is also assumed that in some cases by artful 
modifications of some pit parameters (especially mining method and yearly 
transport tonnage) and the use of continuous transport techniques possible savings 
can be elaborated and realized. Provided that application requirements and deposit 
characteristics do not speak against the use of continuous transport techniques 
right from the outset a potential quantification specific to the application is 
recommended.

Abstract. As a result, finding reserves to improve efficiency of excavator-truck 
systems (ETS) in crushing and conveying overburden complex and 
implementation of their power for the period of commissioning developed: 
- schemes of dumping station, that is suitable for the period of the introduction 
of a combined truck- conveyor transport at the stripping works. Temporary 
concentration horizon is fixed up at the boundary of using excavator-railway and 
excavator-truck systems; 
- method of justification of block-panels width, which are excavated by cross 
panels with varying levels of work sites with using ETS. It conjuncts with 
intensity of development of the working sites and commensurate mining of 
stripping zone is kept up. Step of transferring of dumping station is rational. 
During the transition period of cyclic-stream stripping complex (CSSC) 
implementation the upper stripping zone is worked out by ERC, and the lower part 
of it – by ETS. Carrying out commissioning works at the CSSC No. 1 and No. 2 
and the achievement of their designed horse-power on the border of ERC and ETC 
application predetermines the leaving of concentration horizon. A part of the 
upper stripping of overburden benches by straight drives is rapidly worked out 
through ERC. Preliminary calculations show that according to the condition of 
required pace of advancing the scope of work it is advisable to leave up to 5 
highwalls in a given period of time under ERC. Therefore, there is a chance for a 
part of the working platform on the fifth rock horizon at mark +125/0 m to be used 
to overload the auto stripping to the railway transport.  Increasing its width to 
accommodate the bulk of auto stripping in the transition period is compensated by 
more intensive working off the bottom of the stripping zone EAC. 
Productivity single bucket excavators is determined in accordance with 
applicable regulations (see Table 1 According to academician K.N. Trubetskoy, 
the automobile and railroad complexes represent a series connection of excavator-
automobile and excavator – railroad complexes with the unloading of dump trucks 
at the dumping stations inside the open-cut mining, followed by excavator loading

into dump cars. Due to this, distance for transporting by vehicles is reduced.  The 
use of bottom-hole railway tracks at the lower difficult to access horizons is 
excluded. The dumping station (DS) with accumulating warehouse ensures the 
independence of works of automobile and railroad sub-systems; the distance of 
conveyances by transport vehicles does not exceed 1.2-1.5 km.

Location of the warehouse on the one horizon for a long period of time, as well 
as the proximity of the exchange station to the warehouse creates conditions of 
high productivity work of excavators in transloading.  An annual production of 
excavators at the dumping stations per 1 m3 bucket capacity is 1.4 times higher 
than in the faces. 
Storage capacity is expedient to take within 10 to 15 daily transportation 
volume; it ranges from 100 to 500 thousand m3.  
Dumping station consists of two bings. To select parameters of bings it is 
required to take into account ensuring productive safe operation of a 90-ton 
dumptrucks HD-785-5 Comatsu Company. In this regard, the minimum width of 
bing on top is assumed to be 28 m, while its maximum height does not exceed 8 
m. These parameters of the bing will limit the width in the bottom up to 49 m. 
A two-lane highway is left with two DS from the side of worked off interspace 
between bings of DS and the upper edge of automobile stripping zone at a safe 
distance from the bottom edge of bulks. Its width without an auxiliary panel for the 
ETS is 36 meters.  With one DS on the concentration horizon, the width of this area 
is reduced to at least up to 11 meters,  Then the minimum width of the working area 
of the concentration horizon without consideration of a block panel ERC from 187 
meters with two DS will be decreased up to 161 meters with one  DS. 
As an extraction-loading machine with such parameters of the bing it is 
advisable to use an excavator of EKG- 12US type. This will allow to produce an 
overload in the bulk volume of auto stripping into railway transport means with 
the almost complete cross-section of dass with 30 m in width while leaving the 
minimum volume of non-dispatched portion of rock at the warehouse.

Then the “passive” volume will be located by the ridge along the front works at 
a height of about 7 meters. The maximum productivity from a single dumping 
station on the concentration horizon will be  3.5 million m3 per year. 
Setting the parameters of the dumping station, depending on the coupling with 
the adjacent horizons in terms and traffic schemes of dump trucks within the 
concentration horizon are specified in Fig. 1. 
Reducing the width of the bing from below, and accordingly its height will 
decrease the productivity of dump trucks and the excavator at the DS, and will 
require to use an abutment to increase the length of flexible cable of the excavator. 
It would be possible to accept productivity of one DS while planning mining 
operations from 2.5 million m3 to 3.5 million m3 per year, and with two DS  on the  
concentration horizon - from 5.0 million m3 to 7.0 million m3 per year. 
The proposed design of DS will require changing of the excavator with the 
switching substation to the high-voltage feeder lines only after the formation of 
bings in the new position on the advance increment F . Therefore, based on the 
length of flexible cable of the excavator, the capacity of one bing will be limited to 
a 5- daily transportation volume of auto stripping.  
The length of one bing along the front works 
нш
l
consists of the length of the 
bulk of auto stripping шl
and the length of adjoining cross-over сl .  The length of 
the bulk of auto stripping includes the length of front work along the bulk of the 
excavator of DS within one bing фн
l
and the length of retained portion of bulk но
l
 
, after the shipment from one of the bings of volume warehouse on dass.    
The length of front works on bulk of the excavator within one bing is 
determined by the expression:

According to the calculation, with

length of the bing along the front works will be 406 m.  In this case, the length of

dumping station  along the front works 
пп

, taking into account the distance

horizon.

Fig. 1 The Scheme of the Dumping Station  
Elements and design values of DS are shown in Table 2.  
While developing the ETS block panels from flanks to the center of the open-
pit field, this will allow to freely place in one line up to two DS on the 
concentration horizon and apply a simplified scheme of lay-out of tracks. 
All rock horizons are transport. One or two railways are located in the upper 
stripping zone on the highwalls, worked off onto the railway transport.  While 
working out the highwall onto the vehicles – a transport lane for the two-lane 
strips of road traffic. According to the design, the working out of stripping blocks 
panels onto the  railway transport is envisaged both with the breakdown of the 
rock mass and two excavator passages, and blasting operation in the clamped 
environment to a buffer and one excavator  passage. 
Currently, the development of coal and stripping is carried out by using blast 
hole drilling. Drilling of wells is conducted by boring rigs of rotary drilling.  
The design provides the use of boring rigs of rotary drilling, respectively DM-
45 and DML with a diameter of wells, respectively 175 and 220 mm in the mining 
and stripping works.   
For the estimated year, a large portion of volume of stripping rocks from the 
horizon +95,0 ÷ +110,0 m  is delivered by dump trucks to the concentration 
horizon followed by the railway  transportation and  shipment to the  external 
dumps. The design envisages the creation of dumping station from automobile to 
the railway transport on the horizon + 125.0 m. 
Dumping station will be located on the working side of the open-cast.  
Stripping delivered by automobile transport is stored in a temporary bulk, then it is 
overloaded by the shovel-excavator EKG-12US onto the railway transport means.  
Placement of DS  and freight transportation link with the concentration horizon 
of cargo traffic of automobile and railway stripping are shown in Figures 2a (with 
two DS) and 4b (with single DS).

With two dumping stations, each of them is located along the bench rail-track 
with orientation in terms of center of one of the two halves of the concentration 
horizon. The midst of free platform left between the bings (bulks) of each of the 
two DS (warehouses) is taken as such center.  It is placed in the center of the 
concentration horizon with a single DS.  (Figure 3b). 
Due to the need of transfer of a part of the equipment of a reloading point (RP) 
on a new place in process of deepening of pits and development of mining works 
in practice of design of ore fields the corresponding methodical base is applied to 
justification of questions of transfer and placement of such points [1, 2].

In work [1] the technique of a choice of the horizons of a pit and the placement 
period is given in them the reloading crushing points, allowing in process of career 
development to optimize distribution of traffics between automobile and conveyor 
links of transport system. 
It also provides definition of border of transition to automobile and conveyor 
transport and the solution of problems of formation of the concentration horizons 
taking into account influence of location of RP and conveyors in career on 
development of mining works. 
On coal mines the cyclic and line technology (CLT) only takes root. On 
Vostochny coal mine five top overburden benches are fulfilled by excavator and 
railway complexes (ERC), the others – EAC. The creation of the concentration 
horizon with realization of the combined automobile railway transport is provided 
on border of their application. The main volumes of automobile overburden move 
on an external dump, with combined automobile and conveyor transport. Feature

of working off of overburden benches of ETS is serial dredging of two subbenches 
from both flanks of a career field cross-section cut with changing level of a 
working platform. The construction of temporary auto descents for moving of 
breeds from top subbench is provided for purpose in end faces of a cut.  
The main direction of researches is ensuring compliance of parameters of the 
concentration horizon and ETS blocks panels of design capacity of a cut on coal. 
Design of development of an overburden zone with realization of an intensive way 
of working off of ETS blocks panels consists in ensuring demanded rate of 
development of all overburden zone with various complexes of the equipment. It 
depends directly on productivity of a cut on coal for planned year. 
In turn it is required to observe proportionality of an advance of parts of an 
overburden zone of rather temporary concentration horizon. Speed of an advance 
of a scope of work of benches in the top part of an overburden zone, in which 
ERC are maintained (
ERC
v
), should allow to transfer RP to new situation in due 
time. The demanded advancing of the top part of an overburden zone should be 
created by the time of completion of working off excavator-automobile complexes 
of the blocks on both flanks of a career field.  
Below the concentration horizon where ETS are maintained, it is necessary to 
allocate consistently from top to down average and bottom parts of an overburden 
zone. In an average part of an overburden zone working off of overburden benches 
of ETS is made on offered double-subbench scheme with changing level of a 
working platform.  
The cutting new overburden subbench and cleaning of a roof of the top coal 
layer is made in the lower part of an overburden zone. During certain moments of 
operation of a cut the lower part of an overburden zone can be absent. The 
accepted width of a working platform of the concentration horizon (
wchj
В
), 
without width of blocks of ERC and ETS panels at certain stages of working off, 
makes 117 m at two RP and 91 m at one RP. 
The key adjustable parameter in an average part of an overburden zone is the 
width of the block panel fulfilled by ETS (
b
В ). Especially the long period of time 
reloading points will be maintained without transfer in new situation. In turn the 
width of the block panel should provide timely opening of demanded stocks of 
layers for performance of planned productivity of a cut on coal at the minimum 
demanded volumes of dredging of overburden breeds. Criterion function then 
should answer a minimum of the current overburden ratio (
corij
k
) in planned year 
at a certain stage of working off under condition of proportional development of 
various parts of an overburden zone with the greatest step of transfer of RP:

The given mathematical model allows to prove a step of transfer of reloading

excavator and automobile complexes by cross-section cuts with changing level of 
a working platform. 
Conditions of a formula (2) provide the most rational mode of mining works 
during a certain period of operation of a cut, and restriction (3) are necessary for a 
complete sample of stocks upon transition from one stage of working off to 
another. 
The proportional development of various parts of the overburden zone fulfilled 
with application of railway and automobile transport is reached at performance of 
condition (4), and for the productivity of a cut on coal, the opening of demanded 
stocks is reached at condition (5).  
The change of a corner of a slope of an overburden zone is considered in a 
formula (6) when element’s parameters of development system, including width 
of a working platform of the concentration horizon and the blocks panels fulfilled 
by ETS are regulated. Compliance of a design of an overburden and extraction 
zones with realization of the offered way of working off of ETS blocks panels is 
provided with expressions (7-12) and restriction (13). 
The greatest step of transfer of RP is reached on conditions of formulas and 
restrictions (14-22) with providing rational width of blocks panels for EAC, 
depending on intensity of development of overburden zone parts and with 
application of settlement quantity of the equipment complexes of concentration 
horizon. 
For the accepted productivity of a cut on coal, the technique of justification of 
width of the block panel for ETS depending on a step of transfer of reloading 
points and intensity of development of a working zone is expedient for using at 
justification and choice of the mining transport equipment on overburden works 
with CLT introduction in design. It will provide observance of conditions of a 
proportional advance of parts of an overburden zone by various complexes of the 
equipment of rather temporary concentration horizon.  
In work the integrated calculations for justification of width of blocks panels 
for ETS depending on intensity of development of an overburden zone in borders 
of application of the accepted complexes of the equipment are executed at 
capacity of a cut of 25 million t/year.  
The analysis of calculations shows that at exhaustion of capacity of two CLOC 
lines it is necessary to maintain originally with a maximum load excavators on RP, 
and after exhaustion of this possibility to transfer the concentration horizon on a 
bench below and to execute reconstruction of opening developments of a flank 
external capital trench for an institution of tracks on this horizon [3].  
Results of calculations show that for increase in a step of transfer of RP it is 
necessary to increase speed of an advance of a scope of work of a zone of work of 
ERC. It will allow to increase or width of a working platform of the concentration 
horizon, or size of width of blocks panels in a zone of work of EAC. However the 
size of the last is in direct dependence on existence of a demanded reserve of the 
prepared stocks on coal.        
Technique approbation at the choice of width of blocks panels for ETS proves 
expediency of effective application cross-section cut according to the offered

double-subbench scheme of working off of average and bottom parts of an 
overburden zone excavator and automobile complexes from both flanks of a 
career field. 
In building of capacity of two CLOC lines it is necessary to aspire to use 
reloading points of the concentration horizon with the maximum loading for part 
transfer automobile overburden in means of railway transport. 
Novelty of the offered technique on justification of a step of transfer of 
reloading points is that for the first time this task is solved in interrelation with 
intensity of development of a working zone for the accepted productivity of a cut 
on coal. Taking into account a proportional advance of parts of an overburden 
zone of rather temporary concentration horizon she allows to define rational width 
of the blocks panels fulfilled by excavator and automobile complexes by cross-
section cut with changing level of a working platform.  
At introduction of cyclic and line technology on overburden works of coal 
mines with line technology of coal mining the best results are reached at 
performance of the following conditions: 
- providing the most rational mode of mining works during a certain period of 
operation of a cut with a complete sample of stocks upon transition from one stage 
of working off to another;   
- achievement of proportional development of various parts of the overburden 
zone fulfilled with application of railway and motor transport for opening of 
demanded stocks with set productivity of a cut on coal;  
- influence on a corner of a slope of an overburden zone of change of width of 
working platforms of the concentration horizon and ETS blocks panels at 
regulation in parameters of elements of system of development; 
- observance of compliance of a design of an overburden and extraction zones 
with realization of the offered way of working off of ETS blocks panels; 
- achievement of the greatest step of transfer of RP with rational width of ETS 
blocks panels depending on intensity of development of parts of an overburden 
zone with application of settlement quantity of complexes of the equipment of 
rather concentration horizon.

Investigations to Apply Continuous Mining 
Equipment in a Shovel and Truck Coal 
Operation in Australia

Abstract. Investigations to apply continuous mining equipment in a shovel and 
truck coal operation in Australia 
Beside bucket wheel excavators (BWE) several high performance In-Pit 
Crushing and Conveying Systems (IPCC), which allow the adoption of continuous 
mining systems, even for typical Shovel and Truck (S&T) operations, are 
available today. RWE Power International assists operators technically and 
investigative considering a change from the S&T- to IPCC-technology, both, in 
the planning process involving large scale belt conveyor systems and later with 
operational know-how transfer. In a number of cases the challenges associated 
with this system change have been addressed and solved successfully. One key 
challenge is managing the change in mindset and development of skills for 
operating the belt conveyor systems efficiently.  
OPEX drivers as high personnel costs and diesel fuel cost together with a 
deteriorating coal price make Australian coal mines less competitive in the 
international market. Australian mining companies are looking for alternatives to 
optimize the mining process.  RWE Power International, RE GmbH, has been 
requested by a major coal miner to undertake an IPCC scoping study with a view 
on reducing cost by implementing continuous mining equipment. 
As the reviewed company plans to increase its coal production to 7 Mt per 
annum, RE´s task is to optimize the mine production in regard to reduce 
production costs per tonne of coal. As the operation has a certain amount of very 
soft overburden material, the special focus of this paper lies on the application of 
fully continuous mining systems in these soft overburden horizons. For the 
underling harder zones with multiple coal seams the application of semi-mobile 
IPCC systems is further investigated. 
This paper compares the effectiveness of S&T to continuous mining systems 
for an up to 300 m deep mine with an average annual output of 106 Mbcm. The 
paper starts with an explanation of the conceptional mine design from a classical 
shovel and truck operation to favor the application of conveyor belts. Later on, the 
selection of the mining method will be further explained at the hand of the 
advantages and disadvantage of BWE and IPCC equipment in regard to the

classical S&T pit. Annual effective operating hours, the quantity of staffing 
required and maintenance factors are explained in detail.

Introduction and Project Location 
The client is currently mining about 2 Mt per annum of hard coal in its operations 
in the Collie Basin in Western Australia, located approximately 230 Km southeast 
of Perth. The project site is located about 12 Km east of the city of Collie, WA.  
The client plans to increase its coal production up to 7 Mt per annum in the next 
years. Currently the operation is split into two single pits: Ewington I which is 
currently in production, mining steam coal for the local power plant and Ewington 
II which is currently ceased due to cost reasons.

As the client plans to increase the production to 7 Mt per annum for overseas 
export, RE´s task is to optimize the mine production in regard to reduce production 
costs per tonne of coal and to extend the lifetime of the operation. The client is 
interested to optimise the operation with continuous mining systems. As the 
operation has a certain amount of very soft overburden material, the special focus of 
this advisory mandate lies on the application of fully continuous mining systems in 
these soft horizons. For the underling harder zones with multiple coal seams the 
application of Inpit Crushing and Conveying (IPCC) technology is further reviewed.

Ewington Mine: Geology and Mining Conditions 
The Collie Basin coal deposit is an isolated Permian fault bounded sedimentary basin 
in the Archean basement rocks of Yilgarn Craton. The basin has a length of 27 km

Deposit (SRK Consulting, 2007)

and a width of 13 km, covering an area of approximately 224 km² (Figure 2.1). It 
is stretched in a NW-SE direction and has a sub-parallel orientation to the major 
faults of the surrounding basement rocks. (SRK Consulting 2007) 
The basin is divided into two unequal lobes – the easterly lobe is known as the 
Premier Sub-Basin, the westerly lobe is known as the Cardiff Sub-Basin. Both are 
partly separated by a fault controlled basement, called Stockton Ridge. The shape 
and boundaries of both lobes are mainly determined by the north-west trending 
faults. These faults also limit the general horst and graben configuration of the 
Collie Basin. The coal-bearing sedimentary rock inside the basin has a maximum 
thickness of 1,500 m and range in age from Sakmarian to Late Permian. 
The stratigraphy of the Collie Basin features three main sedimentary formations: 
 
Early Permian Stockton Group 
 
Permian Collie Group 
 
Nakina Formation 
The Early Permian Stockton Group represents the oldest rocks, resting 
unconformably on the Archean basement. This group is present all over the Basin, 
but with a considerable variation in its thickness. The Stockton Group is created 
by glacial or fluvioglacial processes and consist of sandstones, pebble 
conglomerates, mudstone and tillites. 
The Permian Collie Group is the coal-bearing formation and is overlying the 
Early Permian Stockton Group. The three coal sequences are called Muja Coal 
Measures, Premier Coal Measures and Ewington Coal Measures. 
The Nakina Formation unconformably overlays the Permian Collie Group and 
is generally present throughout the Collie Basin. The Nakina Formation itself is 
covered by a laterite layer. (SRK Consulting 2007) 
For the project area due to their location just the Ewington and Premier coal 
measures are taken into further consideration.  
2.1 
Coal Measures 
The Ewington Coal Measures consist of weakly cemented sandstones and 
conglomerates, siltstones, claystones, carbonaceous mudstones and coal. The 
Ewington Coal Measures occur at shallow depths in the Ewington I area, and at 
depth below the Premier Coal Measures in the Ewington II area (Figure 2.2). The 
strata generally dip to the east and north-east at approximately 3 to 10 degrees but 
can steepen to 15 to 20 degrees near faults. The seams frequently split, coalesce, 
and sometimes display washouts (seam thinning). (SRK Consulting 2007). 
Sixteen (16) seams have Resources within the Ewington Coal Deposit. Seams 
E26 and E40 contain high ash, and seams E01, E05, E06, E35 and E50 have no 
resources within the Ewington Coal Deposit. (SRK Consulting 2007)

both seam groups (RWE Power Int.) 
The Premier Coal Measures overlie the Ewington Coal Measures, and exist 
only in the eastern part of the Ewington Coal Deposit area (Ewington II). The 
Premier Coal Measures consist of a sequence of thick and thin coal seams, with 
interburdens comprising sandstones, siltstones and claystones, which generally dip 
to the east and south-east.

Conceptual Mine Design in Favor of Continuous Mining 
Technology and in Consequence of Geology 
3.1 
General Strategy  
The complete Ewington operation can be splitted in two different major overburden 
layers. The “soft” material down to the base of weathering (BOW) with an UCS 
strength below 4 MPa and the harder layer including the coal seams down to the 
E45SF (lowest viable seam of E-seam group) with sandstones up to 90 MPa.  
As to be seen in Figure 3.1 the thickness of the soft material above the Base of 
Weathering (BOW) is shown. The coulours in the figure show that most of the 
weathered material is below 20m thickness. In certain areas the thickness is above 
20m, shown as red in the graphic. The dumps of the existing Ewington I and 
Ewington II operation are clearly visible with a thickness of up to 80m above the 
BOW. (Heiertz 2013) 
The waste dump volume of Ewington II needs to be excavated in advance of 
the mining face. Here it makes sense to utilize a contractor. As there is not 
sufficient data available about the volumes of the outside dump, an interpolation 
of the natural weatherd heights in the area and the dump volume has been done. 
The soft layers seem to be very favourable for the application of cost effective 
Bucket Wheel Excavator (BWE) technology in combination with conveyor belts 
and spreader on the dumping side as these horizons allow free digging no blasting 
of the weathered material is required. A high clay content and cohesive material 
bring the bucket wheel excavator in favour to the discontinuous haulage with 
shovel and truck as they are less prone for slippery surface and ground conditions. 
Based on the experiences of the client the operation of the mine must be stopped 
for several days in the year as precipitation makes the benches too slippery and 
thus too dangerous for truck traffic. (Heiertz 2013)

Fig. 4 Thickness of Weathered Layer above BOW in m (critical height above 20 meters 
marked in red) 
The underlying layers below the BOW of the operation need to be blasted as 
most of the layers are to hard for free digging. The coal seams bigger than 1.3 m, 
which can´t be ripped, also needs to be blasted. As RE has bad experience with the 
combination of BWE and blasting operation due to the lump sizes and 
productivity of the BWE, which is designed for softer material, we recommend the 
utilisation of conventional shovels in combination with trucks in these horizons. In 
this case to lower the production and operational costs we recommend the 
combination of discontinuous loading with high effective continuous haulage and 
dumping. For the Ewington operation this would be Semi Mobile Crushing 
(SMC). Due to the multiple seam structure and faulting below the BOW a high 
flexibility of the mining system is required. Therefore the utilization of Fully 
Mobile Crushing (FMC) applications is not recommended by the consultant.  
A current mining lease area defined in the Jorc Report 2010 has been given by 
the Client. As to be seen in Figure 3.2 the mining lease area contains the current 
operations Ewington I, Ewington II, the coal handling plant with rail loop and the 
outside dumps of the mines. 
The current mine in Ewington I is operated in a long strip from NW to SE 
(Figure 3.3). In sense of applying continuous mining systems this long strip 
operation is already very favourable for the application of conveyor belts and 
continuous mining equipment. With a view on applying this equipment it has been 
discussed to operate the mine in the first years in a pivoting operation and later on 
in a parallel movement, a very favourable operation mode for conveyor belts and 
also in regard to the shape of the whole mining lease area. The pivoting point as a 
center of the operation will be in the south of the mining lease area (Figure 3.4), 
thus the deposit can be fully mined.

As discussed with the client, the mining lease area has been modified in order 
to optimise the operation for continuous mining equipment (CME) and to 
maximise the coal recovery (Figure 3.4). The optimisation of the mining lease area 
requires additional land purchase and governmental permission.

With respect to the given mine planning parameters, the optimized boundary 
and the geological model, the coal excavation at the Ewington deposit has been 
modelled down to the E45 Seam Floor in the whole project area.  
In case of following the E45SF the final depth of the operation would be about 
300m below surface level as to be seen in Figure 3.5.

300 m below surface 
In order to get a first approach and a feeling for the volumes to be excavated in 
the different layers the deposit has been split into 13 strips. The first strip is the 
existing Ewington I operation to be seen in Figure 3.6.

Selection of Mining Method and Technology  
in Regard to Optimization 
4.1 
Mining Methods 
Various mining methods can be imagined to mine the Ewington Coal Deposit. 
To plan and select the equipment of an open pit mine, the following important 
basic facts and conditions in the specific area and the specific mine must be 
considered: 
• 
meteorological, geological, hydrological conditions. 
• 
required annual capacities of overburden and coal 
• 
material properties 
• 
mine planning 
• 
operation planning 
• 
mine depth and logistical constraints 
• 
outside dump height 
• 
transport distances 
• 
and other local conditions 
The coal production aim is high (a 7 Mt/y). Thus the volume of overburden to be 
handled is also quite high due to the average stripping ratio of approx 
13 : 1 (bcm : t). 
The following two mining methods are further reviewed: 
1. Bucket Wheel Excavator for weathered overburden material, 
2. the IPCC method (shovel & truck – semi-mobile In-pit crushing unit – 
belt Conveyor – spreader) for harder waste material and coal below the 
BOW 
4.1.1 
Bucket Wheel Excavator 
Free diggable waste is mined by the bucket wheel excavator (BWE), moved via 
a belt wagon or mobile transfer conveyor  to the bench conveyor and transported 
to the transfer conveyor and further to the dump conveyor, from where it is picked 
up by a tripper car and dumped by a spreader. 
Compact sized bucket wheel excavators (Figure 4.1) do not achieve the 
performance of conventional C-frame machines, but are more robust, can dig 
harder material and are more flexible in their deployment. Also capital 
expenditure / m³ capacity is in RE’s experience below the conventional C-frame 
machines. For this reason matching with the projects conditions the use of 
compact BWE´s is considered. The annual average volume of weathered material 
is about 10 Mbcm which is a good diggable volume for a compact BWE.

operation in Hungary (RWE Power Int.) 
Advantages 
• 
No need for diesel-burning equipment (except for auxiliary equipment, 
usually one dozer) 
• 
Using belt conveyors, higher gradients can be covered compared to truck 
transport. 
• 
Extensive haul road maintenance is avoided. 
• 
Reduced number of trucks in the mine. 
• 
Dust emission control requires less effort. 
• 
Nearly no bad weather downtimes. 
• 
High noise reduction compared to S&T operation. 
Disadvantages 
• 
The initial investment is slightly higher if compared to a pure shovel & truck 
operation. 
• 
The use of bucket wheel excavators requires a more detailed long-term 
planning and equipment specific training of mine personnel. 
• 
More difficult to adapt to changing mining conditions. 
4.1.2 
SMCC Method (Shovel & Truck – Semi-Mobile In-pit Crusher – Belt 
Conveyors – Spreaders) 
All the waste and coal is excavated by shovels and transported by trucks to semi-
mobile in-pit crusher located near the benches at the low wall side, close to the 
pivot point of the mine. The location of the crusher close to the pivot point has the 

484 
A.-J. Heiertz
 
 
advantage of reducing the shifting intervals to a minimum amount. Via belt 
conveyors the waste material is transported to a spreader or the coal to a 
stockyard. Semi-mobile crushers as lump reducer and belt conveyors are an option 
to reduce the number of trucks in operations based on pure shovel & truck 
technology when long transport distances and/or significant lifting heights must be 
covered. 
Advantages 
• 
Lower diesel fuel demand compared to a pure shovel & truck operation can 
result in lower operation costs. 
• 
Using belt conveyors, higher gradients can be covered compared to truck 
transport. 
• 
Extensive haul road maintenance can be limited to bench transport. 
• 
Reduced number of trucks in the mine, 
• 
Dust emission control requires less effort, 
• 
Fewer operators (truck drivers) compared to pure S&T operation. 
• 
Trucks don’t have to climb steep slopes and the operation is less effected to 
bad weather downtimes 
Disadvantages 
• 
The initial investment is higher compared to a pure shovel & truck operation. 
• 
Limited flexibility with respect to the operation of the dumps.

A more flexible alternative to the conventional semi-mobile crushers could be 
the Dual Truck Mobile Sizer (DTMS) developed by FLSmith. 
 
Fig. 12 Dual Truck Mobile Sizer (FLSMITH) 
The advantage of a DMTS compared to semi-mobile crushers is the lack of 
need for a loading pocket, the low loading height (can be located on same level as 
conveyors) and higher mobility (can be built on crawlers or moved by transport 
crawler) to be located close to the loading points. Despite not being ‘proven 
technology’, due to these advantages DTMS should be considered at least for coal 
loading. However, this paper is based on conventional semi-mobile crushers.

Two Alternatives Pure Shovel and Truck and IPCC with 
BWE 
5.1 
Operational Data  
The estimated lifetime of the operation with an annual coal production of 7 Mt/a 
will be 26 years. To mine this amount of coal an average annual required waste 
movement of 100 Mbcm/a will be required. This results in an average stripping 
ratio of 1:13 incorporating a coal recovery of 90 %. The total overburden volume 
for the whole mining operation results in a volume of 2.6 Bbcm. Due to this large 

486 
A.-J. Heiertz
 
 
scale mining operation for further planning and comparison economies of scale 
are considered where applicable.  
For a better comparison of the different mining variants and further calculations 
a pivoting operation in the beginning and a parallel movement of the mine in the 
later years will be assumed (Figure 3.5). In regard to meet the advantages of S&T 
mining truck bridges are incorporated in the mine planning to minimize the 
haulage costs of the equipment. The mining operation requires from the machines 
a high selectability of different interburden materials due to the multiple coal 
seams.   
A shift regime of two working shifts per day of maximum twelve hours (hot 
seat change) each must be applied due to the Australian regulations. For having 2 
crews on duty there will be always one crew off on holiday. Additionally taking 
unforeseen illness of employees and travelling into consideration for the further 
calculations a shift factor of 4 will be applied.  
The mine is operated in two major horizons. This means on the first bench in 
majority soft laterites and clay due to the weathering of the material. The 
underlying benches are a variation of coal seams, stiff clays and medium hard 
sandstones with a maximum strength of 90 MPa. So blasting will be required 
below the base of weathering to allow high production rates. Due to the high 
amount of cohesive waste material and in some periods heavy rainfalls a very 
good and personnel intensive haul road preparation and maintenance for the 
application of heavy mine trucks will be required to avoid that major areas of the 
mine will come to a full stop.  
As described above, the different overburden layers need to be excavated 
separately. The coal must be cleaned from overburden or interburden material. 
Therefore sometimes excavation tools must be used that can excavate from a face 
at any height dictated by the material boundaries. For this, hydraulic excavators 
have a clear advantage over rope shovels.  
Maintenance is one of activities that require a large number of personnel. Wear 
due to the abrasiveness of the ground materials is high. For example maintenance 
cost of the crawler systems are linearly related to the distance travelled. Even short 
advances during working at the face add up to reach significant travel amount. 
Therefore the proposed layout was designed such that the moving distances for 
loading equipment are minimised.  
5.2 
Operation of the Mine by Pure Shovel and Truck (S&T) 
Assuming the Ewington mine as one single operation is run as a S&T mine due to 
the size of the operation and the high overburden volumes the company would 
require economies of scale to run the mine most effectively.  
But as the overburden, especially the weathered material is very soft and also 
the underlying benches are due to their clay content prone for slippery surfaces, 
the largest machines on the market are not the optimum solution here. They would 
be far to heavy for the local ground conditions. Therefore for the further 

Investigations to Apply Continuous Mining Equipment  
487
 
 
calculations the medium sized equipment as rear dump trucks with a payload of 
200 tonnes and excavators in a range of 29 m³ buckets will be applied used to run 
this operation in S&T mode.  
The total depth of the mine will be up to 300 m below surface with an overall 
stripping ratio up to 1:13. To meet this high overburden stripping requirement the 
benches will be maximised in area and depth. Also when the coal seam is dipping 
down to south east the overburden benches will be kept near horizontal to 
maximise output and to generate optimum working conditions for the big shovels. 
The horizontal layout of the benches also has the advantage of better haulage 
conditions due to a nearly complete reduction of lifts in the haulage ways. This 
will effectively reduce the energy costs and the number of trucks on the benches. 
The material will be hauled via the shortest route across the benches of the low- 
and high-wall side to the dumping bench on the same level. Where applicable for 
the lower benches, truck bridges will used for very short haulage to the dump side 
(Figure 5.1). 
 
Fig. 13 Overall mine development strategy along strike 

488 
A.-J. Heiertz
 
 
Depending on the height of the coal seams they will be mined by backhoe 
excavators to allow a good cleaning of the seams and to allow a high selectability 
of the material. Two backhoe configuration excavators with 10m³ buckets are 
planned. For production purpose they are matched with 77t dump trucks to haul 
the coal to the stockpile. The single haulage distance would be about 5 Km. 
5.3 
Personnel  Structure Pure S&T  
The mine developed fully by S&T will require 84 Trucks as maximum amount per 
year for the complete operation. 20 digging units in a range of 29m³ and 10m³ will 
be used. The production numbers here are based on an annual effective operating 
time of 5600 hours. A large number of trucks are required to transport the coal out 
of the pit to the stockpile at the power plant, a haulage distances of up to 5km. 
Also, when operating trucks in soft rock conditions high road maintenance 
standards are essential.  Therefore a significant amount of auxiliary equipment, 
especially grader and articulated trucks are required to prepare and maintain the 
mine roads and infrastructure. Total manning of the mining services is 245. The 
mechanical maintenance fleet will require personnel of 260. As most of the 
equipment is Diesel driven the personnel of electricians is about 87. The factor 
“others” incorporates the white collar employees and the management.

Operation of the Mine by the Combination of BWE and 
IPCC 
For the IPCC scenario a combination of fully continuous BWE for the weathered 
material and a very flexible shovel and truck operation with cost effective

crushing (SMC) and conveying by conveyor belt (IPCC) is considered. As the 
annual effective operating of continuous mining systems is less than a pure shovel 
and operation an calculation based on the proposed system configuration has been 
done and for the further review an annual effective operating time of 4900 hours is 
assumed.   
 
BWE on Bench 1, Weathered Material 
This means in general an application of compact type BWE attached to a conveyor 
system to transport the material to a spreader on the dumping side of the mine. 
The conveyor will be routed on the low wall side of the operations as a belt 
distribution point for material distribution will be required.  
 
SMC on Overburden Benches below Weathered Bench  
To reduce truck numbers and therefore the personnel requirements the continuous 
conveying of waste around the pit to the dumping side is a good way for 
optimizing the operational cost of the operation.  
As described above the different interburden layers need to be excavated 
separately. The lignite must be cleaned from overburden or interburden material. 
Therefore excavation tools must be flexible enough to operate efficiently at 
variable bench heights. For this hydraulic excavators have a clear advantage over 
rope shovels. Also in regard to flexible material movement the truck is the 
favoured choice here.  
SMC or FMC on Coal Benches 
The underlying coal benches are planned to be mined by two 10m³ hydraulic 
shovels due to the need for blending and material distribution. Trucks will be 
hauling the coal in a discontinuous operation to two semi mobile crusher systems 
which are connected to a coal conveyor. The two coal conveyor are continuously 
hauling the produced coal out of the mine.  
From year 8 on the waste volumes of the operation are continuously increasing 
up to 110 Mbcm. To mine this material additional crushing and conveying 
capacity is required. Five waste crushers are serving five spreaders in the same 
range (Figure 6.1). The system combination above the BOW stays the same. The 
coal crushing systems need to be adapted to the height differences and the climb 
on the low wall.  
Direct Dumping on the Lower Benches by Truck Bridge 
Due to the short haulage distance to the dump side the trucks are directly moving 
the waste material by truck bridges to the dump side. This can be just done on the 
lowest benches.

Personnel Structure by the Combination of FMC and S&T  
Due to the implementation of IPCC Systems the number of trucks can be 
drastically reduced. Especially for  the long coal haulage distance the conveyor 
belts replace nearly all the trucks on the way out of the mine. The weathered 
bench normally operated with ultra-class trucks in a range of up to 200t payload 
will now run truck-less as just one BWE is operated here. The utilization of more 
continuous transport systems has also the advantage of a reduction in auxiliary 
equipment. Especially by avoiding the operation of heavy trucks in very soft 
material conditions the number of road building equipment is much less.  
Overall the change in the haulage method for the main benches will cause a 
reduction of down to 1177 employees (Table 6-1) in contrast to the pure S&T 
method (Table 5-1).

Conclusion and Comparison of the Two Variants 
OPEX drivers as high personnel costs and diesel fuel cost together with a 
deteriorating coal price make Australian coal mines less competitive in the 
international market. Australian mining companies are looking for alternatives to 
optimize the mining process.   
This paper compares the effectiveness of S&T with a continuous mining 
operation in two different mining variants for an Australian mine (up to 300m deep) 
with a total average output of 106 Mbcm. The mining operation with BWE´s and 
IPCC with supplementary truck transport is compared with a full S&T operation. 
The comparison between these two variants demonstrates the reduction of manning 
requirements with the implementation of continuous conveying, IPCC, systems.  
The calculations show that continuous mining systems in long-term mining 
operations have advantages in sense of reduction in staffing in material movement. 
Especially in normal S&T operations the haulage of the material is personnel and 
energy intensive. For large  and deep operations with high stripping ratios the 
differences increase with increasing stripping ratios and depth. In the direct 
comparison between pure S&T and IPCC in the same mine, by the production 
with minor truck transport the number of employees is reduced. A reduction in 
truck transport is also followed by a reduction of ancillary equipment, hence a 
reduction of employees.  
The following Table 7-1 finally shows the comparison in employee numbers 
for the same deposit mined by two different variants:

Abstract. At present, a surface lignite mining has been operating in the north of 
Thailand, but there are other reserves of lignite in the south of Thailand that not yet 
operating. All of lignite production in Thailand used to produce electricity and the 
demand of electric is increasing every year. So, in the future, the lignite reserve in the 
south of Thailand may need to operate in serving electricity demand of Thailand. 
One of the main investment cost (capital cost) when the mining company wants to 
operate a mine is equipments cost, and the main equipment cost is the transportation 
system cost. While, in Thailand, truck and shovel were used in the transportation 
system of the lignite mining because of the flexibility of the movement and selecting 
the zone of lignite and waste easily, especially in the geological condition of the 
steeply bed of ore. So, in the new mining operation, the question of the number of 
truck and shovel and which capacity needs to buy for achieving the target of 
production planning, can be found by using this prototype model. 
A prototype system dynamics model (SDM) for finding an optimal truck and 
shovel of a new surface lignite mining in Thailand is a prototype dynamic decision 
making tool by using the system dynamics theory and computer software modeling 
(Vensim DSS software). The SDM was decided an optimum condition of the truck 
and shovel using an optimum cycle time theory and it’s also a fast and flexible tool 
to change the mining production rate and other variables. Thus, the optimum cost of 
buying trucks and shovels which shown the number and capacity of truck and 
shovel were found with this dynamic decision making tool.

Introduction 
Coal is an energy resource from hydrocarbon which is currently a major source of 
electricity and energy in industries. From past to present, there are many coal

reserves around the world and the large coal mining are operating in diverse 
countries such as USA, Russia, China, Australia, Germany, India, and Indonesia, 
etc. Thailand coal resources found in many areas, and the most of coal in Thailand 
are lignite. A lignite mining in the north of Thailand has been operating, that is the 
Mae Moh Lignite Mining. Furthermore, it has some reserves in the south of 
Thailand (Krabi and Songkhla) which have not been operating yet.

Status of Coal in the World and Coal Mining in Thailand 
Coal is one of the World’s most plentiful energy resources, it was estimated about 
861 billion tones reserves around the world (2008, 2012) [2-3] which cab be an 
average used in 109 years, compared with oil and gas are 52.9 years 
and 55.7 years respectively [3]. It is mainly source use to generate electricity. 
Thus, it is today and will be in the future the most important global source of 
electricity, and also many industries use for making the merchandise. Nowadays, 
there still have many coal resources around the world and large coal mining is also 
operating in several countries.

in the cycle time of both equipments. 
However, in the ideal of optimum condition of trucks and shovels, it should have 
a continuous working without a waiting time. Moreover, the optimum trucks and 
shovels in term of size and amount also related to coal production rate, working 
time, truck driving speed, etc.

Research Methodology 
4.1 
Background Theory and the Research Working Process 
System dynamics theory [7] was used to support the logic and thinking of this 
research, and the system dynamics model (SDM) was developed by using Vensim 
DSS Software [8], it helps to connect each variable and calculating the results, 
which cover the theory of cycle time of truck and shovel selection. The simple 
research working process is shown in Fig. 4 below. 
In this research, the case study simulation result of the prototype SDM focuses 
only optimum trucks and shovels for the coal production rate. Mae Moh Lignite 
Mining produced 16 million tons/year [5], and Krabi reserves estimated the 
production rate around 5.5 million tons/year, which excluded the activity of the 
topsoil and overburden transportation.

Model Variables Analysis Result 
The variables of the model are separated into 2 types, (1) input variables which have

The optimum point result of a minimum cost of buying trucks and shovels 
supported by the optimization function in Vensim DSS Software. So, the optimum 
point was re-checked by manually changed the input variable, that make 16 
scenarios to choose truck and shovel. The result of manual checking is shown in 
Table 3 below. It is confirmed that the optimum point is in scenario No. 10, gives 
the same as using an optimum function in Vensim DSS, that the minimum cost of 
buying trucks and shovels is 2.925 million euro.

Simulation Result of Krabi Reserves Condition 
In the Krabi reserves condition, it was used only the Vensim DSS optimization 
function. So, the minimum cost of buying trucks and shovels in the condition of 
Krabi reserves is shovel type 3rd (bucket size 2.5 m3), truck type 3rd (capacity 77 
tons). Numbers of shovels are 2 shovels, numbers of trucks are 4 trucks, and cost of 
buying trucks and shovels at optimum point is around 1.35 million euro.

Conclusion and Discussion 
The prototype dynamic model of optimum truck and shovel selection can help to 
decide the suitable number of trucks and shovels automatically and rapidly. It’s an 
alternative tool which fast and flexible to change multiple value of input variables 
for creating many alternative scenarios. We can use Vensim DSS optimization 
function to find the optimum point for supporting decision making. In the case 
study condition, the objective of optimum point is to search the minimum cost of 
buying trucks and shovels, and the prototype SDM can show the calculation result 
in a different optimum point in the different condition. 
In case of Mae Moh Lignite Mining, the optimum number of truck is 8 trucks 
with capacity 77 tons, and the optimum number of shovel is 3 shovels which have a 
bucket size 5.4 m3 and cost of buying trucks and shovels at optimum point is around 
2.92 million euro. Furthermore, in case of Krabi lignite reserves, the optimum 
number of trucks is 4 trucks with capacity 77 tons, and the optimum number of 
shovel is 2 shovels which have a bucket size 2.5 m3 and cost of buying trucks and 
shovels at optimum point is around 1.35 million euro.  
For the further development, the prototype SDM can add more criteria in term of 
cost such as maintenance cost, operating cost, and mine closure cost, etc., and 
summarize in a total cost to be a better decision criteria. The prototype SDM also 
should verify with more case study for example, in Songkhla reserves, and include 
more detail of variables in the future.

Research on Energy Consumption in Open Pits 
of the German Quarry Industry 
Thorsten Skrypzak, Alexander Hennig, and Christian Niemann-Delius 
RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany 
Abstract. Quarrying of natural stone is an energy-intensive process. The utiliza-
tion of this type of raw materials will remain essential in the future. Thus, a sys-
tematic improvement of the energy efficiency in this mining branch will gain 
sustainable benefit. 
A research project at the Department for Surface Mining and Drilling at RWTH 
Aachen University focuses on the development of a systematic approach for the 
identification and utilization of possible energy savings in quarrying of natural 
stone. This research project is promoted by the German Federal Environmental 
Foundation (Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt, DBU). Within this project, energy 
consumption data was collected in several quarries. Also key aspects and quantity 
of energy data collection were evaluated regarding their benefit for the companies. 
1 
Introduction – Relevance of the Topic for the Quarry 
Industry 
In the Federal Republic of Germany 500 million tons of industrial rocks and min-
erals, mainly sand and gravel, limestone and other hard rocks, are annually exca-
vated in open pit mines. [MIRO 2013] The production and processing techniques 
include various sub-processes, which differ in type and number depending on the 
characteristics of the raw material and the mineral deposit. In general, the extrac-
tion of raw materials is an energy-intensive production process. This applies espe-
cially to the quarrying of natural stone, which usually requires multiple crushing 
stages in addition to the loosening, loading and transport of the mineral. The ener-
gy intensity of mining can be illustrated in relation to other fields of industry. 
With an energy consumption having a share of 9 % of the gross production value, 
the industrial rocks and minerals industry is one of the most energy-intensive 
manufacturing industries in Germany. [STATBUNDESAMT 2011] 
The importance of industrial rocks and minerals, which are mainly used in the 
construction industry, will remain essential in the future. Thus, a systematic in-
crease of the energy efficiency in this mining branch will gain sustainable benefit. 
In addition, the economic advantages, which energy savings generate for the  
companies, have to be considered. The topicality and importance of these aspects 
increased in recent years. This is not only due to energy prices, which were more 
or less continuously rising in the recent past. Also current political trends and 

504

resulting legal regulations reflect the importance of the topic of energy efficiency 
for the German industrial rocks and minerals industry. 
Based on the energy concept the Federal Government passed in September 
2010, measures were initialized by the legislator to encourage the utilization of 
energy efficiency potentials. For example, this concerns tax benefits and especial-
ly the energy tax cap for companies of the manufacturing industry. From 2013 
onwards, only companies who are actively contributing to energy savings can 
apply for this tax privilege. The contribution can be evidenced by the implementa-
tion of a certified energy management system referring to DIN 50001 or alterna-
tively by an equivalent system of different kind. [BMWI 2010] 
Due to this legal regulation, which was enacted in November 2012, many com-
panies of the quarry industry have started with the implementation of an energy 
management system. But the systematic collection of energy data can be way 
more than an evidence to be eligible for the energy tax cap. Though it is linked 
with financial and organizational effort, it is the basic requirement for the identifi-
cation and elimination of possible weaknesses in energy use. Irrespective of the 
type of energy management system, the methodical collection of energy data can 
be an option to achieve economic advantages. This applies especially to an ener-
gy-intensive field of industry like the quarrying of stone.

Mining Methods and Equipment Used in Quarries 
A research project at the Department for Surface Mining and Drilling at RWTH 
Aachen University focuses on the development of a systematic approach for the 
identification and utilization of possible energy savings in quarrying of natural 
stone. Of particular interest are optimization potentials in the fields of the equip-
ment available on site, equipment combinations and the machinery operation in 
the quarrying of stone. 
Nine quarries were integrated in the project. In these open pits, which produce 
crushed rock, discontinuous mining methods and discontinuous machinery are 
commonly operated. The equipment is mainly diesel-electrically powered. This 
applies to the loosening and loading process as well as to the haulage operation. In 
the participating quarries the loosening of the rock material is carried out exclu-
sively by drilling and blasting. This represents the most common loosening tech-
nique in hard rock mining. Diesel-powered drilling equipment is used to create the 
blast holes. As an alternative hydraulic excavators are operated in some quarries to 
loosen the rock material by ripping, if this is possible due to the rock properties 
and the characteristics of the mineral deposit. Other methods as for example cut-
ting techniques are almost exclusively used for the production of dimension 
stones. 
Hydraulic excavators, more precise front shovels and crawler-based  
backhoes are the main loading equipment in quarries, though the use of  
wheel loaders has increased in the recent past. Hydraulic shovels are able to  
generate higher digging forces due to their way of construction. Hence  

Research on Energy Consumption in Open Pits of the German Quarry Industry

they are more suitable to handle blasted rock, which is difficult to load. 
[EYMER et al. 2006a] In addition they can be used for the fragmentation of bould-
ers. Wheel loaders provide a higher level of mobility. That allows a faster reloca-
tion between different extraction points. Furthermore, wheel loaders can be oper-
ated as a combination of loading and haulage equipment, if the transport distance 
does not exceed approximately 250 m. [EYMER et al. 2006b] This so called load-
ad-carry method used in one of the quarries that participate in the project. In this 
case, a wheel loader hauls the blasted rock to a semi-mobile crusher. After prima-
ry crushing the material is transferred to a belt conveyor and transported to the 
processing plant. 
The use of belt conveyors in hard rock mines of the German quarry industry ra-
ther represents an exception so far. The haulage process from the production site 
to the processing plant is typically carried out by diesel-powered vehicles. Mainly 
rigid frame dump trucks are used in hard rock operations, whereas articulated 
trucks are less common in quarries. Usually a stationary primary crushing plant is 
the point of destination for the haulage process. When compared to belt con-
veyors, the main advantages given for dumpers are mobility and the greater flex-
ibility for the pit design. In addition, issues regarding the required investment 
costs are mentioned, because the average production rate in the field of the Ger-
man quarry industry is only 250,000 tonnes per year. [MIRO 2013] 
The methods and processes described illustrate the importance of diesel fuel in 
quarry mining. The price of diesel fuel for large-scale consumers averaged  
112 Cent per litre plus purchase tax between January and November 2013. 
[STATBUNDESAMT 2013] Compared to the previous year, that means a slight 
decrease in the fuel price. By analyzing the development over a period of several 
years, a consistent increase in prices is obvious. As equipment with diesel engines 
is mainly used in quarries, significant research on fuel efficient combustion en-
gines and drive concepts has already been conducted for several years. In contrast 
to this, research on possible savings due to the optimization of the interaction 
between different sub-processes and equipment has rarely been done. 
3 
Capture of Energy Consumption Data in Production Sites 
Part of the research project was the capture of data concerning the energy con-
sumption and the production process in the participating quarries. The intention 
was to document and analyze the energy consumption in order to derive key fig-
ures of the energy demand of quarrying. In this context, it should be determined 
how much effort has to be spend on data recording and how detailed the informa-
tion has to be, to identify possible energy savings and to develop measures for an 
increase of energy efficiency. Especially the differences in energy consumption 
when comparing the single quarries and the reasons for these differences were of 
particular interest. 
The aspects mentioned are of special importance in the field of mining. The 
characteristics of a mineral deposit are naturally given conditions and as such they 

506

cannot be influenced. The configuration of the production process has to be 
planned decisively based on these characteristics. It cannot be configured inde-
pendently, as it is the case for many other industrial production processes. The 
result is a large number of parameters, which influence the energy consumption. 
In addition the influence that can be exceeded on these parameters differs from pit 
to pit. For example, the energy demand, which is necessary to produce one tonne 
of basalt rock, will typically vary depending on the rock properties, even if two 
quarries use the same mining method. The overall specific energy consumption is 
often used for the comparison of two mines. This has to be seen skeptically. The 
following table shows the overall energy consumption in the quarries that partici-
pated in the research project. The demand of diesel fuel and electric energy is 
given specifically per tonne of mined mineral.

By comparing the different quarries, the fuel consumption varies between 0.4 
and 1.0 litre per tonne of mineral. Even quarries that mine the same type of miner-
al (cp. quarry 6 and 7), differ by of 0.25 litres of fuel demand per tonne. But a 
statement regarding possible energy savings cannot be given based exclusively on 
this information. Neither it is recognizable in which sub-process a certain share of 
the total energy consumption occurs, nor it can be determined if the parameters 
that cause this consumption can be influenced. Thus, based on the overall specific 
energy consumption an optimization of the energy efficiency is not possible. 
 
 

Research on Energy Consumption in Open Pits of the German Quarry Industry 
507
 
 
In some operations basic data were not recorded or to be more precise were not 
available. For example the electricity consumption in three quarries was only 
known to the central business administration of the companies, but no to the tech-
nical management. It has to be assumed that this data has not been checked in 
consideration of technical aspects. That also means that the energy efficiency of 
the electrically powered facilities in these quarries is not monitored so far. 
The approach of this research project was to capture operational data from dif-
ferent levels of the operations. The data were classified according to the following 
system: 
1. Operation level 
• 
Total energy consumption 
• 
Characteristics of the mineral deposit 
• 
Production rates (mass movement of overburden and saleable 
mineral) 
• 
Pit design, bench heights, haulage distances 
2. Process level 
• 
Characteristics of the drilling and blasting operation 
• 
Equipment combinations and coordination in the loading and 
haulage process 
• 
Data of processing stages (primary and subsequent crushing 
stages) 
3. Machinery and equipment level 
• 
Fuel and electricity consumption of particular machines 
• 
Machinery dimensioning 
• 
Cycle times of equipment 
• 
Equipment availability and utilization 
• 
Time demand for auxiliary operations 
• 
Maintenance intervals or inspection of certain parameters (e.g. 
tire pressure or track tension) 
The collection of data was executed during on-site inspections and discussions. 
It has to be mentioned, that there were significant differences concerning the 
availability of data in the different quarries. This was already pointed out by the 
example of the overall electricity consumption. Plenty of verifiable information 
was available regarding the dimensioning of equipment and facilities as well as in 
the field of blasting techniques. In case of other aspects it became obvious that 
there has to be a significant improvement of data recording and analysis in the 
quarry industry prior to a successful optimization of energy use. This applies for 
example to the loading and hauling equipment. For these machines there was just 
little knowledge concerning cycle times and waiting periods as well as concerning 
equipment utilization. The same applies to the share of load and idle times of the 
primary crusher, when looking at the total operating hours. In this respect, the 

508 
T. Skrypzak, A. Hennig, and C. Niemann-Delius
 
 
technical management of the quarries usually was usually able to indicate esti-
mated values, but not to verify these data. 
The following table shows the availability of certain data in the participating 
quarries. It was only evaluated, if and in which quantity data recordings were 
available. But type and use of these data are not rated in this table. The classifica-
tion is based on the percentage of questions and parameters the technical man-
agement of the quarries was able to inform about. The classification set up in-
cludes the categories sufficient > 75 %, middle-rate > 50 % and problematical 
< 50 %, which refers to the amount of available information, respectively ans-
wered questions. If there was no information available, this is indicated by the 
abbreviation “n.a.” (not available).

As can be seen from the table, only little data has been captured in the past in 
those operations. Furthermore it turned out that the information available is often 
not sufficiently analyzed or that it is not made use of existing systems for the re-
cording of energy data. This applies for example to options, the system control of 
processing plants usually possesses. Another example is represented by the sys-
tems for data storage, which dump trucks of newer production series are typically 
equipped with and which can be read out in cooperation with the manufacturer of 

Research on Energy Consumption in Open Pits of the German Quarry Industry

the machine. In this context, also the amount of data has to be considered, which is 
generated by such recording systems. The effort required for the analysis of this 
information is only practical for major production machines in a quarry. Therefore 
a ranking of the machinery should be set up considering the energy consumption 
and operating time to identify the main energy consumers. 
Irrespective of that, the table illustrates how little assured information and veri-
fied data concerning certain processes and parameters exist in a large number of 
quarries. This especially applies to the operational status of the machines and 
facilities regarding utilization. In case of the loading and hauling equipment, this 
includes for example the percentage of nonproductive time referred to the total 
operation time and hence the coordination of both sub-processes. This is also true 
for the load and idle times of the primary crusher and subsequent processing stag-
es. Another example is the use of the main loading equipment for auxiliary opera-
tions, as the cleaning of the quarry face or the fragmentation of boulders in the 
blast rock. The time demand for these auxiliary operations and hence also the fuel 
demand of the loading process can be significantly reduced e.g. by a modification 
of the blasting method. All of these conditions attract just little attention and are 
rarely documented. 
In the fields mentioned, the knowledge usually consists of empirical values. 
Those are not necessarily incorrect. Often they even represent helpful and relative 
precise reference values. However, these empirical values cannot be seen as a 
reliable basis for an optimization because of their insufficient verifiability. To 
increase the energy efficiency of particular sub-processes of quarrying or even of 
the whole operation, a more systematic and specific data capture is required, than 
it was carried out so far. 
This includes among others a basic documentation of the fuel consumption of 
single machinery, as for example the loading and haulage equipment. In many 
quarries fuel logs are common but very rarely evaluated regarding possible fuel 
savings. For this purpose it is useful to combine the measured fuel consumption 
with information about loading and haulage capacities as well as operating and 
idle times. Waiting periods at the loading and discharge points should also be 
recorded. The same applies for the load and idle time of the primary crusher and 
the related energy consumption. For example, this can be realized by the installa-
tion of a wattmeter in the electric circuit of facilities, which have comparatively 
high driving powers or running times. So far, only a central data record of the 
overall electricity consumption is common in the quarry industry, which is not 
sufficient for an evaluation and optimization of the energy use.

Conclusion 
As part of a research project at the Department for Surface Mining and Drilling the 
energy use in quarrying of natural stone was analyzed. Though quarrying is an ener-
gy-intensive process, the energy use is mostly not systematically monitored so far. 
Mainly political reasons have encouraged many companies of the quarry industry to 
start with the implementation of an energy management system in the recent past. 

510

Hence the companies can derive economic benefit from these systems, the capture 
of energy data has to become more methodical and specific in the future. 
Aspects evaluated were the availability of energy data and the fields of opera-
tion, in which there is need for improvement of data capture. It has to be men-
tioned, that there were significant differences concerning the availability of data in 
the quarries. Usually, information concerning sub-processes and machinery as 
well as their operational status and utilization is not sufficiently documented. This 
applies especially for the loading and haulage equipment and the primary crusher. 
As basic fields of interest load and idle times, waiting periods and the time de-
mand of auxiliary operations were identified. These aspects are important regard-
ing single equipment and also for the coordination of the different sub-processes 
of quarrying. Such information is crucial for a methodical identification and utili-
zation of energy savings, which is of sustainable benefit because of the present 
and future importance of the industrial rocks and minerals industry.

Wirtgen Surface Miner – The First Link  
of a Simple Extraction and Materials  
Handling Chain in “Medium Hard”-Rock 
Bernhard Schimm and Johanna Georg 
Wirtgen GmbH, Windhagen, Germany 
Abstract. The application of an IPCC system in an open pit operation can 
comprise a reduction of operating costs by 20 – 60 % in comparison to truck 
haulage but still the latter is the favored transportation method. However since the 
costs for e.g. fuel and labor increase, IPCC systems again come into focus. 
Therefore three theoretical approaches how to connect the Wirtgen Surface Miner 
to a conveyor system are discussed because the surface mining technology can 
offer additional benefits by merging the process steps drilling, blasting, loading 
and crushing to one step. The three approaches cover  
- 
The continuous transportation by direct loading of the Surface Miner 
onto a fully mobile conveyor, 
- 
The direct loading of the Surface Miner onto a truck and discontinuous 
haulage to a semi-mobile feeder and shiftable conveyor and  
- 
The Surface Miner operating in the windrowing mode, where the material 
is picked up by a front end loader and discharged onto a mobile feeder 
connected to a mobile conveyor.  
All three concepts offer a potential applicability within an open pit operation. It 
is concluded that a detailed evaluation needs to be carried out to gather more data 
to be able to compare the three approaches with IPCC systems.

Introduction 
Within the mining industry Bucket-wheel excavators and downstream conveyor 
systems are the leading technology for continuous mining and transport in soft and 
free diggable rock mining since more than half a century. Due to the need of 
increasing the production, while mining deeper and lower grades makes it 
necessary to have high production rates. It is a matter of fact that conveying high 
quantities of bulk material over larger distances and inclinations is known as the 
most cost effective method.  
However drilling, blasting, loading and transportation of the material by truck 
out of the mine is still the most common procedure used. Increasing costs, for 
example fuel and labor costs (see Figure 2), as well as longer transport distances

Fig. 3 Exemplary application of a fully mobile IPCC system (Niemann-Delius, 2012) 
Application of a mobile IPCC system allows the elimination of the truck 
haulage in the mine. The crusher is placed at the workface where the excavator 
loads the blasted material directly into the hopper. There it is crushed and fed 
directly onto the mobile conveyor. The mobile system follows the workface 
subsequently, which reduces the operating costs for transportation up to 60 %. 
Concerning the planning of an IPCC system a step-by-step mine planning is 
indispensable. The dimensioning of the IPCC system within the planning phase is 
most important. It has to consider an increase of production over the years but 
may not be oversized since as well as the capital costs as the load factor have to be 
taken into count. Fixed IPCC systems need a detailed and confident mine planning 
considering the whole life-of-mine. This means the production has to stay more or 
less the same, capacity increments are hardly viable. Mobile and semi-mobile 
IPCC systems offer a more flexible application and can fit easier in material 
changing deposits. Anyhow a good mine planning for dimensioning of the 
equipment is necessary.  
Comparing IPCC systems with truck haulage, the latter is still the most flexible 
system. But the following advantages and disadvantages need to be considered 
when selecting the transport equipment. 
Advantages of the IPCC system: 
- 
Shortening the truck haulage distance 
- 
Operating costs associated with fuel, lubricants and tires are reduced 
- 
Labor costs are reduced 
- 
Safety risks are reduced 
- 
Dependency on tires and fuel reduced

Connecting Surface Miner with In-Pit conveying (IPC) 
The Wirtgen Surface Miner unites and simplifies the process steps of the 
conventional mining method drilling, blasting, loading and primary crushing in 
one process step. As a result the use of a primary crusher to prepare the ROM (run 
of mine) for the conveyor transportation is obsolete. The Surface Miner is an areal 
working mining equipment. It mines layer by layer and each layer is cut path by 
path. There are two modes in which the Surface Miner can be applied. The first 
mode is the direct loading onto a truck here a discharge conveyor is attached to the 
machine. Another possibility is to operate the Surface Miner in windrow mode. In 
this mode the Surface Miner deposits the cut material behind the machine. In a 
following step the material can be picked up by a front-end loader.  
 
Besides the simplification of the excavation process and the reduction in 
operating costs, Wirtgen GmbH has the objective to integrate the Surface Miner 
into an in-pit conveying (IPC) system. This additionally reduces the operating 
costs for transportation. Therefore three theoretical concepts are presented for 
discussion, on how the Surface 
Miner can be integrated in an IPC 
system:  
 
1. Direct loading from the Surface 
Miner onto a shiftable conveyor 
belt (focus of this paper). 
2. Loading material from a Surface 
Miner onto a truck which 
transports the material to a 
semi-mobile feeder within the 
mine. 
3. Surface Miner working in windrow mode, the material is loaded with a loader 
and dumped onto a mobile feeder which is connected to a mobile conveyor 
system.  
 
Definition of terms used in relation to mine planning 
and Surface Miner: 
 
Layer:  
all cuts on the same level are referred 
to as layer. 
Block:  
one block is the amount of material 
that is mined in one operation, starting 
at the surface and ending at the 
designated depth of the pit.  
Strip:  
 all blocks that are mined in one line are 
referred to as strip. The first strip is 
stated as box-cut.

3.1 
Direct Loading onto a Mobile Conveyor Belt 
As part of a case study a fully mobile IPC system to remove overburden linked to 
a Surface Miner has been elaborated by Wirtgen GmbH. The idea is to connect the 
Surface Miner to an overland conveyor by a fully-mobile conveyor system. In this 
case the overland conveyor is the preferred solution to transport the overburden 
because the dump area is 20 km advanced from the mine. To connect Surface 
Miner and overland conveyor a in every direction mobile multiple module 
conveyor (e.g. Flexiveyor, see Figure 6) has to be implemented into the system 
and integrated into the mining sequence. Since the multiple module conveyor is 
still in the pilot stage, this concept is a theoretical approach. The approach has 
been based on the mobile multi module conveyor systems that have been 
introduced into the mining market for room and pillar mining operations under the 
expectation that they can be adapted to surface mining operations. There they have 
proven their applicability within the mining operation. 
 
 
Fig. 6 Flexiveyor (Diversified Mining Services, 2013) 
Linking a mobile IPC system to a Surface Miner has the big advantage that 
truck haulage in the mine will be eliminated. This enables the Surface Miner to 
mine a cut in one continuous operation. Therefore a mobile conveyor belt of the 
length of the block has to be installed in the mining area. At the top of the ramp 
another mobile conveyor is installed and beside the blocks a shiftable conveyor 
has to be implemented because this conveyor has to be shifted after four blocks 
have been mined (in this case 1&3 and 2&4, see Figure 7). The shiftable conveyor 
is connected to the overland conveyor, where the material is distributed to its 
destination. Two blocks will be mined parallel by two equipment units to achieve 
a higher utilization of the overland conveyor as well as a faster advancing 
exploitation.

However, this concept has some serious constrains, which have to be evaluated 
in trials:  
- 
Very often shifting of the mobile conveyer required, every third cut, because 
of the high advance speed of the Surface Miner and the low cutting depth. 
- 
A mobile conveyor is needed for this application but does only exist as 
conceptual design and is no proven equipment. 
- 
Material removal at the beginning and at the end of the cut/block is not solved. 
 
For a realization of this concept, following exemplary issues have to be solved: 
- 
Direction of movement of the multiple module conveyor: In conveying 
direction and perpendicular to the conveying direction 
- 
Loading operation: Surface Miner has to be able to load the material on the 
multi module conveyor at any point of the conveyor line, a discharge 
conveyor has to be mounted on to the Surface Miner 
3.2 
Loading Material from a Surface Miner onto a Truck Which 
Transports the Material to a Semi-mobile Feeder within the 
Mine 
The main idea of this approach is to use the benefits of truck and conveyor 
haulage and to eliminate the negative aspects of each transportation method. The 
truck haulage distance is shortened and the uphill transport minimized, since the 
costs for uphill truck haulage represent about 40-50% of the total transportation 
costs. Further this concept enables a high flexibility of the system and no major 
changes within the mining sequence have to be made.

Ritter, 2013) 

The First Link of a Simple Extraction and Materials Handling Chain

The Surface Miner will also mine blocks. Hence, the cut material will be 
discharged onto the trucks and hauled to the next installed semi-mobile feeder. 
The material is then transported with a shiftable conveyor and the overland 
conveyor to the distribution point.  
This system has the advantage that it can be adjusted to changing deposit 
conditions and has the charm that it can be implemented in already existing mine 
layouts and mining sequences. Additionally the number of trucks and associated 
expensive labor can be reduced. This reduces operating costs. The disadvantage of 
this system is again the dependency on the truck availability. 
3.3 
Surface Miner Working in Windrow Mode, Loading the 
Material with a Loader and Dumping it onto a Mobile 
Feeder Which is Connected to a Mobile Conveyor System 
Within this approach the Surface Miner is applied in the windrow mode. The cut 
material is deposited behind the machine and will be picked up by a front-end 
loader. The loader transports the material to a nearby moveable feeder where it is 
discharged onto a mobile conveyor.  
Here the usual mining sequence of the Surface Miner can be applied too 
because the mobile conveyor is not connected directly to the Surface Miner. This 
results in an alternative design of the mobile conveyor as it does not have to 
follow the cuts of the Surface Miner. Accordingly an existing system like 
Lokolink from Metso can be applied.  
Since the trucks can be eliminated within this approach the Surface Miner can 
cut with maximum speed. The system is now constrained by the front-end loaders 
which only have an economic travel distance of about 200 – 250 m. The total IPC 
system also needs a detailed mine planning to avoid unnecessary shifting of the 
mobile conveyors.  
4 
Discussion 
The three concepts comprise the application of a Surface Miner in combination 
with a fully mobile or semi-mobile IPC system. In the following Table 1 the main 
issues of each concept are summarized.  
All introduced systems are moveable and can be applied very flexible in the 
mining sequence. However the second concept offers an even more flexible 
application in the pit since it can be adapted to changing deposit conditions.  
Nevertheless a detailed mine planning is essential when an IPC system should 
be deployed successfully. Therefore the production capacity over the life-of-mine 
has to be determined in the mine plan because a capacity increment of the IPC 
system is only viable to a limited extent.

Conclusion 
The three approaches of the applicability of the Surface Miner with an IPC system 
have shown that a detailed evaluation of the concepts should be accomplished. 
Therefore trials have to be performed to gather reliable data. Further the data can 
be used to compare the conventional IPCC systems with the Surface Miner IPC 
system. The researches indicate that using a Surface Miner in combination with an 
IPC system instead of an IPCC system can result in further cost benefits. This is 
because surface mining technology in combination with an IPC system offers 
benefits in transportation as well as mining and material processing by merging 
the process steps of the conventional mining method to one step.

Concept for Applying the Continuous and 
Selective Mining Features of Surface Miners  
in a Strip Mining Operation 
Claudel Martial Tsafack 
RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany 
Abstract. Surface miners in the last years have experienced a remarkable 
development, from a technological point of view as well as in their area of 
application. The factors that determine the applicability of the machine are the 
hardness of the material to be cut and the dimensions of the working area. 
Additionally when different main equipment are teamed with the Surface miner 
(SM) in one operation the individual system constraints have to be merged. An 
example for this is the application of SM in Strip Mining operations. Furthermore, 
since SM have proven their advantages in stratified deposit with interburden, 
schemes are required for combined operation. This paper analyzes the systematic 
approach to merge the constraints of Strip Mining operations with those of a SM. 
Of utmost importance for the SM mining sequence of coal (and interburden 
respectively) is the way the DL continues after finishing one and starting the next 
strip. Accordingly this paper furthermore discusses the consequences of the 
different options for the DL and the SM operation. 
1 
Introduction 
SMs nowadays are gaining more significance and are becoming in some operations 
the major mining equipment. The capability of mining material selectively and to 
operate continuously promotes them to become an alternative as well as a concurrent 
for conventional mining equipment. Both features together give them the advantage 
of being applicable in specific operations. SMs have proven their applicability as 
well as their productivity in some mining projects all around the world. They use to 
be considered as auxiliary equipment though they are becoming in numerous 
projects the main production machinery. They are applied in coal mining operation 
in India and in tabular iron ore deposits in Australia. 
Nevertheless looking at the SM as principal mining equipment or as one of the 
major ones, additional constraints, advantages and disadvantages result from 

524

merging it with other machines or system of machines. One operation where 
fitting the SM may have upside potential is the coal recovery in a strip mining 
operations. The conventional coal removal here is up to now predominantly done 
by shovels and trucks or wheel loader and trucks. Especially when dealing with 
multi-seam deposits the use of the SM may lead to reduction of DL rehandling and 
the need for further DLs or machine fleet to deal with interburden. 
This paper focusses on the development and the presentation of schemes for 
integrating the SM in strip mining operations. The development is based on SM 
and DL way of operation as well as some of their specificities. Furthermore the 
description and the presentation of the systematic for teaming DL and SM 
constraints are conducted. 
2 
Surface Miner (SM) 
Surface miners are used for cutting material while traveling along a defined 
working path. The cutting drum is either attached in front, at the back or in the 
middle of the machine. The Wirtgen 4200 SM considered in this paper is equipped 
with a middle drum. 
The SM combines almost all mining steps (drilling, blasting, loading and 
crushing) in one operation. As selective and continuous mining equipment SMs 
are capable to mine material with strength up to 80 Mpa economically. [Wirtgen 
SM Handbook, 2010]. The mined material can be handled in two ways. It can 
either be dumped after the cutting process that is the so called “cut to ground” or 
directly loaded on trucks, that is the so called “direct loading”.  
The application of SM holds, beside the capacity of doing several mining 
operation in one step, some other advantages. One is the production of good 
quality ROM due to the selectivity feature. Different materials are able to be 
mined separately this being a substantial advantage while dealing with multiple 
layers deposits and lead additionally to costs reduction in the processing plan. 
Furthermore a higher level of safety is achieved as no explosives are used for the 
material loosening process. Additionally avoiding negative blasting effects such as 
vibration, dust and noise has a positive effect on the acceptance of the neighboring 
communities in densely populate areas.  
Nevertheless the SM also has some disadvantages. The performance of the 
machine for instance is extremely dependent on the material hardness. This leads 
to high operating costs due to outstanding fuel consumption or to relatively high 
bit pick consumption. Furthermore the decision of applying a SM is also dictated 
by the type of the deposit. They are applied in layered and tabular deposits such as 
coal where they reach high productivity. In addition, their effective production 
capacity also depends on the length of the chosen working area. Then the 
maneuvering operation occurring at the end of each cut, and the production losses 
during that time, force the minimum working area to be some 500 m long 
representing an effective cutting time of around 70 %. [Wirtgen SM Handbook 
2010]

525

Dragline (DL) 
Draglines were developed in the USA and in the former UDSSR to allow an 
economical mining of tabular or bedded mineral deposits with extremely thick 
overburden. Their comparatively low operating costs and high productivity make 
them to be unbeatable in waste removal operation and dumping when conditions 
like high production requirement are met. 
They are used in so called Strip Mining operation. Basically draglines moves 
overburden from the current strip and places it in the former mined out one. They 
can handle up to 85 m of overburden depending on the class of machine. The 
resulting strip width varies between 30 and 100 m. [SME Book, chapter 10.3] 
The working level and position of the dragline depends on the thickness of the 
overburden or the overall material above the deposit. The operation mode is 
chosen base on the geology, the material characteristics, the deposit specifications 
and the production rate for instance. For the purpose of this study the Simple Side 
Cast operation mode of the DL is applied.  For simplicity reason only the applied 
operation mode used in this study is described next. 
3.1 
The “Simple Side Cast” Mode (SSC) 
Here the dragline stands on the top of the overburden and strips down to the edge 
between the overburden and the valuable mineral (in our case coal). This is the 
dragline standard mode of operation. The stripped material is directly placed in his 
final position (previously mined out strip) after a swing of 90°. Basically for the 
appliance of the SSC mode the material needs to be unconsolidated. Otherwise 
fragmentation (blasting) is needed.

in a Strip Mining Operation: Description of the Systematic 
Approach  
4.1 
Prerequisite 
The constraints resulting from merging a DL and a SM are mainly due to their 
respective way of operation and the resulting mandatory working sequence when 
team together. Those are: 
• 
The SM minimal working length,  
• 
the safety distance to be kept to the DL,  
• 
the maneuvering time at the end of every cut,  
• 
the advance speed of both machines and finally, 
• 
the possible production loses causes by production interruption due to 
additional standstill, are the principal constraints faced.

Fig. 2 Box cut in the coal layer (not to scale) 
The right side of the “box cut” is characterized by a comparatively flat slop 
representing the “advancing slope” or “production slope” and 200 m safety 
distance. During SM box cut operation the production slope has to be extended up 
to 500 m minimum. (See figure 1). It is assumed that after the box cut, the 
production slope progresses in the direction of the DL with a constant distance. 
After the box cut the SM now mainly works on the production slope which 
progresses towards the DL leading to an increase of the haulage distance 
compared to the position of the first access ramp. Therefore a sequence for the 
relocation and the optimal position of the access ramp along the strip has to be 
developed. Furthermore the SM, in his stripping activity, mines precise cuts next 
to each other till the working area is completely mined out. However, the SM 
always has to turn back (about 180°) after reaching the end of each cut in order to 
position itself in front of the next one for cutting in the opposite direction. Because 
the maneuvering time has to be kept to a minimum it is highly important to define 
the way the different cuts are going to be mine depending on the strip width 
available. 
 
Fig. 3 SM cutting scheme and trucks hauling scheme (not to scale) 
For the purposes of this paper a strip width of around 80 m is considered and 
the applied SM is the Wirtgen 4200 SM with a cutting drum width of 4.2 m and a 
cutting depth of up to 0.83 m. [Wirtgen Handbook 2010]. The proposed cutting

scheme is depicted in figure 3. Moreover the stripped coal is directly loaded on 
trucks driving close to the SM. The direct loading is enabled by the SM 16 m long 
discharge boom. The developed path for SM stripping operation as well as trucks 
hauling ones for achieving to an efficient maneuvering pattern of the SM is 
showed in Figure 3. Furthermore an overview of all the activities conducted by the 
SM in a precise working path as well as a hauling scheme for trucks and the way 
access ramps are utilized based on the mining progress are presented in figure 4. 
 
Fig. 4 Hauling scheme (not to scale) 
The SM integration as well as it is way of operation in a strip has been 
described and presented above. Nonetheless the impact of such integration on the 
DL activities has to be assessed. The correlation of both machine advance speed is 
therefore conducted.  After uncovering the coal the DL have either to wait for the 
SM to recover the remaining coal before starting the next strip or walk back to 
start a new strip at the other end of the pit. For this paper the possibility of 
walking back is not considered. 
According to pre-defined advance speed of the SM, the DL standstill can be 
unlikely long. A model based on linear equations has been developed to overcome 
this situation. The equations represent the advance speed of both machines. They 
are integrated in an Excel based model providing the user with parameters 
influenced by teaming a SM with a DL.  
The maximum DL standstill time is commonly assumed to be three days. This 
is the time the SM disposes to recover the remaining coal at strip end. To keep the 
DL waiting time to a maximum of three days, both machines linear equations need 
to be defined. Therefore the DL “SSC” mode DL is considered. After defining the 
equations the linear function representing the advance speed of both machines are 
set up.

leads to intersections or none of both linear functions depending on the SM

Conclusion 
The study presented in this paper shows the integration of a SM in a Strip Mining 
operation. It is worth using the SM as coal mining machinery as long as a clear 
and well-structured stripping scheme is applied. The main critical point during 
operation is the standstill time of the DL at the end of the strip. This can be fairly 
determined, forecasted and adjusted with the help of the presented model. 
Although the study is a theoretical one it nevertheless reflects the potential of 
applying the SM in a strip mine operation for coal recovery. Further analyzes for 
assessing the outcomes of this paper base on a case study should be conducted 
next. Additionally an economical and operational model to compare conventional 
coal recovery operation (shovel, wheel loaders and trucks) with the application of 
SM in a strip mining operation will permit to define and capture the upside 
potential and downside risk of applying the SM in such an operation.

Dimča Jenić, Predrag Golubović, and Darko Milićević 
Copper Mining and Smelting Complex Bor Group Bor, Serbia 
Abstract. The strategic plan of copper production in Cerovo as part of the Veliki 
Krivelj mining complex is based on the certified balance sheet of copper ore 
reserves of over 511 million tons, on the possibility of more ore mining by 
purchasing new high capacity mining equipment, reconstruction and acquisition of 
new flotation equipment and the reconstruction of the smelter and construction of 
a new sulfuric acid plant, which will all provide for a better recovery and 
environment protection with high-tech environmental standards. 
The paper contains a basic concept of mining developed and applied in this 
region. 
Keywords: strategic plan, balance of ore reserves, high capacity equipment, 
reconstruction, flotation equipment, smelter, sulfuric acid plant.

Introduction 
The techno-economic feasibility, perspective of work and particularly the 
development of mining and metallurgy at RTB Bor have been worked out in a 
document called the Copper Production Business Plan at RTB Bor for the period 
2011-2021, thus confirming and justifying the investment in technological 
modernization of the entire production line and economic profitability of mining 
and processing of home copper resources. 
Fluctuations of copper price in the last 10 years (from $1940 in 2000 the price 
rose to $8500 in 2011) with all forecasts in metal prices in world markets for the 
upcoming period, suggest there will be a serious economic and market basis for a 
significant increase in the physical volume of copper production. 
RTB Bor has also installed facilities for the flotation and metallurgical processing 
of the total excavated copper ore, which will add value to its own mineral resources 
and production of finished products. 
For these reasons, RTB Bor has planned a substantial increase in production from 
its large mining complex Veliki Krivelj - Cerovo, or from the mines of Cerovo and 
Veliki Krivelj as the concentrates produced in these two mines account for 55% of 
the total concentrate production at RTB Bor for the 2012 to 2021 period.

General Geology 
The mining complex of Veliki Krivelj - Cerovo is an area within the Timok 
Magmatic Complex which includes copper deposits of Cerovo and Veliki Krivelj.  
These are large-scale porphyry deposits. Wider area of the deposits is shown in 
Figure 1.  
Cerovo deposit is located ten kilometers northwest of Bor. There is a railway 
and asphalt road to Bor. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Geographic-metalogenetic map of eastern Serbia 

Development of the Cerovo - Veliki Krivelj Mining Complex at RTB-Bor 
537
 
In the Cerovo deposit, porphyry mineralization is located in the zone of 
hydrothermal altered andesite rocks 1.5 km long with a maximum width of 600 m, 
which is dipping to the east - northeast. The deposit is in the horizontal projection 
of an oval shape, elongating in the NNW – SSE direction. In the vertical 
projection, it is irregular in shape and dipping below the level of -100. 
Bearer of copper mineralization are chalcopyrite and bornite. 
The Veliki Krivelj deposit is situated about 6 km north-east of Bor. There is an 
asphalt road to Bor. 
Viewed in a horizontal cross section, porphyry copper deposit of Veliki Krivelj 
has direction NW - SE. Its longer axis is 1.5 km with a maximum width of 700 m. 
The deposit falls to the southwest, while we can not yet speak of its final depth as 
several wells of 800 m in depth are proof of mineralization. 
The main copper ore barrier is pyrite and chalcopyrite as well as bornite at a 
small extent. 
Surface areas are oxidized (30 - 50 m). Coating of limonite, malachite, azurite 
and tekorite is present too. 
2.1 
Ore Reserves at Veliki Krivelj - Cerovo 
The development of mining at the Veliki Krivelj - Cerovo complex is based on the 
certified balance of ore reserves of 611 808 102 t with average copper content of 
0.33 %. The balance is given in Table 1. 
Table 1 Balance of geological reserves as of December 31, 2011

Long-term production plan at RTB - Bor for the next ten to fifteen years will be 
based on:  
1. Mass surface mining method in: 
• 
Copper Mine Cerovo (deposits: Cerovo 1 and Cerovo 2, Cerovo Primary 
and Drenova), with a capacity of 2.5 x 106  of ore per annum in the first 
phase and a capacity of 5,5 x 106  t of ore per annum in the second phase.  
• 
At the Veliki Krivelj copper mine - capacity of 10.6 x 106 tons of ore per 
year.

3.1 
The Cerovo Open Pit Mine and the Processing Plant at 
Cerovo 
The Cerovo copper mine is located about 25 km northwest of Bor. It was opened 
in 1993 and temporarily closed in December 2002. 
Under the current circumstances, there is a real possibility to re-open the mine. 
At the open pit mine of Cerovo, all the necessary infrastructure is already there: 
access roads, water and sewage networks, electric power supply to the substation 
and gas station, telephone network, drainage system etc. 
There is also a facility for ore preparation and processing to the level of 
grinding along with the accompanying infrastructure. 
While the mine was in operation, a 14 km hydro transport system was used to 
transport the pulp to the Bor Concentrator where froth flotation was applied and 
concentrate produced. 
The annual production was 2,500,000 tons of ore. 
The existing infrastructure will still be used for the future production along 
with the necessary reconstruction and rehabilitation to obtain the capacity of 2.5 
Mt of ore per year and further expansion of facilities to reach the target of 5.5 Mt 
of ore per year. 
To resume production, a new hydro transport system was constructed with a 
completely new technical and technological water system on the new route, 
having in mind that further processing will be done at the Veliki Krivelj 
Concentrator. 
Getting ready for a re-launch of the mine, defects on the equipment were 
repaired, and other machines and devices installed on the technological ore 
processing line. Based on our inspection, underway now are reconstruction works 
and installation of equipment necessary for bringing the entire plant in operation 
for the installed capacity of 2.5 mt of ore per year, where the following will be 
included:  
• 
Mechanical and electrical works at the primary, secondary and tertiary 
crushing and grinding with thickener; 
• 
Measuring and control equipment for the primary, secondary and tertiary 
crushing and grinding. 
3.1.1 
The Concept of the Development of the Cerovo Mine 
Our further plans for the development of mining in this deposit are based on 
continuation of production at the open pit Cementation 1 and opening of the new 
mine Cementation 2. In the next phase, our plan is to open Cerovo - Primary 
deposit and Drenova deposit. 
Considering the possibility of further development of the Cerovo deposit, 
optimization was performed in the mining deposits of Cerovo 1,Cerovo 2, Cerovo 
Primary and Drenova.

In the first phase in 2012 and 2013, Cerovo 1, up to 2.5 Mt of ore annually will 
be mined and in 2014 mining of Cerovo 2 will begin with 5.5 Mt of ore per year. 
Practically, phase II will begin then with successive mining of Cerovo - Primary 
and ore body Drenova and will last until 2021 when mining will end without the 
relocation of the railroad. 
Production up to the grinding level will be performed in the existing facilities 
of Cerovo, and the pulp will be further transported via a new hydro system to the 
Veliki Krivelj Concentrator.  
In this procedure, without relocating the railroad, around 49 Mt of ore will be 
excavated with average copper content of 0,34%, 50 Mt of overburden wand the 
total amount of copper in the ore of 160,972 t or 140,000 t of copper in the 
concentrate.  
The following table gives a summary of calculations of the Cerovo deposit until 
the end of its mining life, including the relocation of the railway.  
The total mineable ore reserves can be increased by optimizing new mines, 
given the upward trend in metal prices in the world market.  
Fig. 3 shows the Cerovo mining field.

The Concept of Ore Processing and Concentrate 
Production 
According to the strategy adopted by the company of RTB Bor, increase in ore 
production capacity has been planned at the mining complex of Veliki Krivelj - 
Cerovo with copper ore of 16.1 Mt to be processed annually. At the Veliki Krivelj 
Concentrator, it will be possible to increase the processing capacity for the ore 
coming from Veliki Krivelj deposits after  reconstructing the crushing, screening 
and grinding systems, as well as in the section of flotation concentration by 
replacing the existing flotation machines with larger ones. For the Cerovo ore, it 
will be necessary to install a new line of flotation cells. 

542 
D. Jenić, P. Golubović, and D. Milićević
 
During 1998 and the 1999, certain reconstruction activities on the crushing and 
screening systems were performed to reduce the size of crushed ore by 100 % - to 
20mm. 
However, it was found that the optimum coarseness at the inlet to the rod mill 
with F80 rods was from 12000μm - 14000μm, and that was the reason why it was 
necessary to reduce the size of the crushed product to 100 % - 16mm. It was the 
recommendation of Metso company which technology was implemented during 
the reconstruction of crushing and screening when new flotation equipment with 
an automated process was launched. 
Along with the activities on the reconstruction of the crushing facility, we 
started installing new flotation cells of larger volume, such as those used in mines 
worldwide of similar capacity. 
Basic engineering provided by Metso Minerals is the basis of the project of 
replacement old machines. The basic concept of replacing old flotation machines 
with larger ones is all about a better design, which will eventually lead to better 
technological results, savings in their maintenance and less power consumption 
per unit of processed ore. 
Reduced coarseness of the crushed ore 100 % - 16mm will increase mills 
capacity and retain fineness of the ground ore of 58 % of class - 74μm in the 
hydrocyclone overflow (which will be measured by the latest PSM device). Mills 
will be able to process 424 t / h of dry ore for the adopted working index of Wi = 
14 kWh / t. To achieve the newly designed capacity, the system has to be able to 
automatically control and regulate the grinding process. 
According to the basic design, the entire hydrocyclones battery will be replaced 
with a new battery with hydrocyclones of a smaller diameter in order to obtain 
better and more stable fineness of the grind. A new battery will operate with a 
hydrocyclone pump and an attached rotation speed variator to provide a constant 
pressure at the inlet to hydociclones. In addition, all other pumps will have such 
variable speed  rotation regulators. 
Instead of 119 existing DENVER DR500 type machines for the basic Krivelj 
ore flotation, 18 RCS100 machines will be used, or the so-called tank cells. 
Instead of 78 existing DENVER DR100 and DR300 type machines used for the 
primary Krivelj ore concentrate treatment, 12  RCS40 machines will be used. 
Additionally, instead of 8 existing DENVER DR500 type machines that were used 
for extended flotation, 4 machines RCS40 will be used. 
In addition to installing new tank cells, a new flotation monitoring and 
controlling system will be installed too, with the latest equipment for copper 
content monitoring at the inlet and outlet of the flotation machine (X -ray 
analyzer). There will also be installed a part for the preparation and distribution of 
reagents in which two new mixers will be placed, as well as new tanks for the

daily receipt of new reagents and their distribution. Other equipment for the 
preparation of lime, control of the pulp pH value, dewatering of the final copper 
concentrate and tailings, fresh and return water supply will not be subject of the 
aforementioned reconstruction, as it is believed that they can meet the demand of 
increased ore processing. 
These changes will guarantee the technological recovery of 87 % and higher 
copper concentrate quality of 21 % Cu. 
Guarantees are given by Metso Minerals, who is the supplier of the new 
equipment. 
Overall Positive Effects of Larger Ore Processing Capacity at the Veliki 
Krivelj Concentrator 
• 
With optimum size crushing of 100 % -16 mm, maximum grinding 
capacity will be achieved, power will be saved (about 5 % ), as well as 
metal for grinding, rods and lining (10%). 
• 
Better control of the hydrocyclone overflow, too much comminution of 
the raw material or at least insufficient release of the beneficial 
component will be avoided that will directly affect poor technological 
parameters. 
• 
Before the pulp reaches the conditioner prior to the basic flotation and 
also at the output, copper content and the content of other components 
will be checked (modern X -ray analyzer), so that an optimum dose of 
collectors to be added can be determined, as well as the density of the 
pulp and the required amount of air in the machine, all of which will 
contribute to better technological parametrs. 
• 
Flotation in new large volume tank cells which are less costly to 
maintain, will provide for much better results in terms of technological 
efficiency and the quality of concentrate. 
• 
Fully automated flotation process means less physical strain for the 
operator, which will definitely lead to less risk of injury at work (better 
protection of workers). 
 
Due to the fact that larger amounts of copper concentrate will be required for 
the new smelter, RTB has decided to reactivate the Cerovo mine to the level of 
grinding at Cerovo and hydro pulp transport to the Veliki Krivelj Concentrator. 
Having in mind that funds needed to open any mine are extremely high, it was 
decided that in the first phase, the Cerovo mine should reach the previous capacity 
proven for many years while this plant had been in operation of 2.5 Mt / year, and 
after that the capacity of 5.5 Mt / year from 2014 onward will be be reached. 
Phase One of 2.5 Mt / yr 
The equipment to be used in the first phase of the Cerovo mine is the crusher now 
used at Majdanpek, after being generally repaired and made fit for the mine.

All available equipment that was used at the Cerovo mine will be used again 
(conveyers, bunkers, mills, thickeners, hydrotransport pumps) after a complete 
inspection and repair. For the hydro - pulp from Cerovo to the Veliki Krivelj 
Concentrator, two separate pipelines will be installed with a diameter of 340 mm 
each and a capacity of 2.5 Mt / yr as well as a necessary pipeline for the return 
technological and technical water all in order to reach the ultimate capacity of 5.5 
Mt / yr. 
In the first phase of processing of the Cerovo ore at the Veliki Krivelj 
Concentrator, old equipment will be used (DENVER type flotation cells) as 
follows: 
For primary ore flotation of the Cerovo ore, 28 DENVER DR 500 machines 
will be used 
- 
Tertiery and secondary processing in 4 +8 machines DR100 and 4 +4 
machines for primary and  extended flotation 
• 
Existing old conditioners for receiving and conditioning the pulp from 
Cerovo 
• 
Necessary technical fresh water will be delivered from the lake water 
pool in Bor and the process water from the pumping station at the Krivelj 
tailings dump field I, first to the pool at the Veliki Krivelj and then to the 
pool at Cerovo. 
• 
Concentrate will be dewatered and filtered with the equipment of the 
Veliki Krivelj concentrate as these two will join at the Concentrator and 
then taken to the thickener. 
Second Phase of 5.5 Mt / yr 
Second Phase of the Cerovo Mine Will Involve Investment in the New 
Equipment 
Purchase of new crushers, mills (preferably autogenous and semi-autogenous) as 
well as buying new large volume flotation machines. 
Purchase of new RCS 100 machinery is planned, which will only add to the 
series of three lines with three machines. This is how we have planned to increase 
the current capacity to 5.5 Mt / yr within the current expansion of the Veliki 
Krivelj Concentrator.

Conclusion 
The planned development of the Veliki Krivelj - Cerovo mining complex as part 
of the copper production strategy will bring a positive impulse for the 
development of RTB Bor Group and the entire region. Strategic Plan to produce 
more copper is based on the confirmed copper ore reserves, possibility to increase 
mining capacity by purchasing new high productivity mining equipment, 
reconstruction and purchase of new flotation equipment, reconstruction of the 
smelter and construction of the new sulfuric acid plant. By implementing all these 
activities, more efficient technology will be purchased and environmental 
protection brought to the highest standard, and the respective economic 
performance will bring this significant copper producer to the highest world level.

Water Management Situation 
Currently, approximately 90 to 100 million tons of lignite are extracted every year 
up to a maximum depth of about 450 m in the active open-pit mines Garzweiler, 
Hambach, and Inden which are located in the tri-city area of Cologne, Düsseldorf, 
and Aachen.  Most of the extracted lignite is converted into electricity in the power 
plants Niederaußem, Neurath, Frimmersdorf, Weisweiler, and Goldenbergwerk.  
Former open-pit mines in the western and/or eastern part of the Rhenish lignite 
mining district (the open-pit mines Zukunft, Frechen, Bergheim, and Fortuna-
Garsdorf) as well as in the district’s southern part (Ville) were recultivated and, 
predominantly, rehabilitated.  The service lives of these open-pit mines will continue 
until 2030 for Inden and until 2045 for Garzweiler and Hambach.

In order to ensure secure lignite extraction in open-pit mines, the groundwater 
level has to be lowered as a preparatory measure and kept at a sufficiently low 
level during any open-pit mining operations.  That is why the water level in the 
excavation slopes of the overlying stratum (above the coal) needs to be lowered to 
the bottom edge of the respective groundwater aquifer.  Below the coal, the 
groundwater level needs to be lowered to the level of the operational underlying 
stratum (bottom edge of the coal) in order to avoid any hydraulic ground seepage. 
The start of large-scale open-pit mining in Ville in the 1960s marked the 
beginning of extensive drainage measures in the Erftscholle region, and to a lesser 
extent also in the Venloer Scholle region located to the north as well as the 
Rurscholle region located in the west.  How these drainage measures develop over 
time (please see Figure 1) is determined by the individual exploration points for 
open-pit mining, the pertinent extraction and rehabilitation phases (Forkel, 2011;

Objectives of the EC Water Framework Directive 
The EC Water Framework Directive issued in 2000 defines basic environmental 
objectives for all European water bodies, for brooks, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and 
coastal waters.  The key objective of the European Water Framework Directive is to 
reach a “good status” for all rivers and lakes as well as the groundwater.  The  
water quality is to be safeguarded and, if need be, further improved 
(http://www.umwelt.nrw.de/umwelt/umweltinformationen_umweltberichte/umwel
tbericht_umweltindikatoren/index.php).  In order to maintain and/or improve 
biodiversity, the water bodies are to regain their good ecological status once again.  
Wherever this proves to be impossible because the surface waters were modified 
substantially and/or created artificially, the water bodies are to reach at least good 
ecological potential.  An additional goal is the regulation of the water balance. 
What the management of surface waters and groundwater (water bodies) seeking 
to accomplish these objectives looks like is outlined and summarized in the 
Management Plan for the North Rhine-Westphalian sections of the Rhine, Weser, 
Ems, and Maas river basin districts.  This summary is based on comprehensive, 
basic water management data of the current situation and the causes of pollution, the 
existing utilization of the water bodies, and the available options for improving the 
status 
of 
such 
water 
bodies 
while 
also 
considering 
their 
utilization 
(http://wrrl.flussgebiete.nrw.de/Bewirtschaftungsplanung/index.jsphttp://wrrl.fluss
gebiete.nrw.de/Bewirtschaftungsplanung/index.jsp). 
The Management Plan is supplemented by a Program of Measures, by profiles 
of the planning units, and by reports of the (inter)national Rhine, Weser, Ems, and 
Maas river basin districts. 
These planning unit profiles include water body related information on the 
status of surface waters and the groundwater, the pollution of and management

objectives for individual water bodies as well as the program measures intended 
for individual water body groups. 
North Rhine-Westphalia is characterized by its high population density, its 
history of environmental burdens dating back to the era of mining and heavy 
industry, and its current utilization by industry, power generation, agriculture, and 
transportation routes. 
The objectives of the Water Framework Directive can be achieved – even 
though, in many substantiated cases, this will not happen before 2027.  So far, 
exemptions have become necessary in the lignite mining district, in the limestone 
quarrying sector, and for few water bodies affected by former ore mining. 
According to the Official Notification by the North Rhine-Westphalian 
Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Agriculture, and Consumer 
Protection (MUNLV) of March 29, 2010 (Ministerial Gazette MBl. NRW., 2010 
Edition, No. 12 of April 15, 2010, Pages 249 to 258), the Management Plan and 
the Program of Measures are binding for the public authorities and need to be 
observed with regard to the enforcement of water management. 
The Background Document on Lignite substantiates the exemption made for lignite 
mining with regard to groundwater and the discharge of drainage waters particularly 
into the Untere Erft River, which is contrary to the management objectives laid down 
in the Water Framework Directive, and integrates it into the Management 
Plan/Program of Measures for the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia 
(http://wrrl.flussgebiete.nrw.de/Dokumente/NRW/Anhoerung/Hintergrunddokume

Exemptions from the Management Objectives for Lignite 
3.1 
Exemptions from the Management Objectives for the 
Quantitative Status of Groundwater 
For the affected groundwater bodies, any drainage measures undertaken on behalf 
of lignite mining represent an abstraction of water from the groundwater 
resources.  Pursuant to § 47 (formerly § 33a Para. 1) of the Water Management 
Act (WHG), groundwater is to be managed in such a way that any detrimental 
change in its quantitative and chemical status is avoided, any significant and 
sustained upward trend in the concentration of pollutants resulting from the impact 
of human activities is reversed, a sound balance between groundwater abstraction 
and groundwater recharge is assured, and a good quantitative and chemical status 
in accordance with the WHG is maintained or attained.

aquifer as well as the section of the lowered confined groundwater level in deeper 
aquifers (the so-called underlying stratum).

lowered confined groundwater level in deeper aquifers (dark green, partially superimposed

Figure 3 provides an overview of those groundwater bodies which, according to 
current forecasts, are not expected to reach any good quantitative status in 2015 
(and presumably also not by 2027) due to drainage measures carried out on behalf 
of lignite mining. 
According to § 47 and § 30 of the WHG (formerly § 33a Para. 4 Sent. 3 of the 
WHG under the provisions of § 25d Para. 1 Nos. 1-4 of the WHG), any existing 
impairment of the groundwater management objectives resulting from the 
lowering of the groundwater level due to ongoing lignite mining operations 
constitutes an exemption from the management objectives for the quantitative 
groundwater status.

Fig. 3 Groundwater body which is not expected to reach a good quantitative status in 2015 
due to the impact of lignite mining 
It needs to be mentioned that due to the dynamic mode of operation and the 
dynamic progress of lignite mining, it will not be possible to clearly differentiate 
in the future between any previous interventions to the groundwater balance as a 
result of ongoing human activities (the consequences of which have, in part, either 
already occurred or will, to some extent, only appear for the first time in the 
future) and any new interventions and/or new changes associated with the future 
progress of the mining activities.  Due to the spatial development of open-pit 
mines, some areas which have not been influenced so far will be newly affected 
by the lowering of groundwater whereas, in turn, initial groundwater resurgences 
already occur in the rear sections of open-pit mines.  Another decisive factor is the 
delineation of groundwater bodies which can, of course, never be identical to the 
constantly changing boundary line reflecting the actual impact area of the drainage 
measures.  That is why it was essential to also consider the exemption clause laid 
down in § 47 and § 31 of the WHG (formerly § 33 Para. 4 Sent. 2 of the WHG in 
conjunction with § 25d Para. 3 Nos. 1-3 of the WHG – pursuant to Article 4 
Para. 7 of Directive 2000/60/EC dated October 23, 2000) in the Explanatory 
Statement in order to take into account any anticipated new changes.  An 
exemption from the management objectives for the quantitative groundwater 

552 
T. Pabsch
 
status may be granted provided that there are any recent changes in the 
groundwater level or in the physical properties of surface waters and, furthermore, 
provided that certain conditions are met: 
Lignite is (in addition to regenerative energy carriers) the only primary energy 
carrier used in Germany which is available completely from domestic mining and 
which is, thus, free of any availability and/or price risks associated with import 
markets.  The extraction of lignite is in the public interest both with regard to § 1 
Item 1 of the Federal Mining Act (BBergG) (securing the supply of raw materials) 
and with regard to § 1 of the Energy Industry Act (EnWG) (securing a safe and 
reasonably priced energy supply). 
With regard to the future energy mix, indigenous lignite continues to be 
available in the long run; thus, making Germany independent of imports from 
other countries (public interest of lignite mining). 
Indigenous lignite contributes more than 20 % to the entire gross power 
generation in Germany.  Particularly in the base load power generation sector, the 
conversion of lignite into electricity will be indispensable in the future since even 
renewable energy is, due to the specific features of its availability at the business 
venue Germany, not capable of replacing lignite which is used for base load power 
generation.  That is why lignite mining and its conversion into electricity is of 
particular public interest and of overriding importance in Germany when it comes 
to securing a sustainable supply of energy with a specific focus on the energy 
supply of tomorrow.  According to expert estimates, the costs of generating power 
from lignite in Germany are at the bottom end of the cost scale for the production 
of electricity in Germany.  This demonstrates that the use of indigenous lignite for 
power generation not only makes a vital contribution towards a secure energy 
supply that does not depend on imports, but also substantially contributes towards 
an affordable supply of electric power (secure and inexpensive energy supply). 
Public interest in lignite mining was already considered in the State Planning 
Decision which is part of the Lignite Mining Plans that had been prepared and 
approved for the individual open-pit mines.  The objectives of this State Planning 
Decision are binding for the regional authorities in the federal state, and the 
aforementioned decision constitutes a binding framework specifying the necessity 
of lignite extraction for the duration of the scheduled extraction activities. 
Public interest which is reflected by this State Planning Decision is also 
paramount in light of the fact that the conversion of Rhenish lignite into electricity 
actually secures numerous competitive jobs in and beyond the mining district 
(State Planning Regulations). 
Even under the aspects of climate protection, there is and continues to be a 
primarily public interest in lignite extraction and its conversion into electricity in 
the Rhenish lignite mining district.  Within the district, the RWE Power AG 
corporation operates lignite power plants, which are currently the most modern 
ones of their kind, at the locations Niederaußem and Neurath (BoA 2/3).  In line 
with the provisions for older plants, existing blocks will be permanently shut 
down and replaced.  Thus, RWE Power AG’s power plant renewal program is 

“Exemptions” from the Management Objectives 
553
 
making a vital contribution towards reducing specific CO2 emissions resulting 
from the conversion of lignite into electricity (consideration of the climate 
protection aspects). 
The energy management objectives, which are pursued in the form of 
groundwater abstraction with the above mentioned consequence of a deviation 
from the quantitative targets for groundwater management, cannot be achieved 
with other suitable measures having considerably less adverse impact on the 
environment.  For lignite mining, the quantitative status in the affected 
groundwater bodies is, at the same time, impaired by the lowering of groundwater 
levels in such a way that no sound balance can be guaranteed between 
groundwater abstraction and groundwater recharge by 2015, and that it will be 
neither possible to maintain nor to achieve a good quantitative status of the 
groundwater by that time.  In fact, maintaining the groundwater abstraction from 
the respective groundwater bodies is a mandatory prerequisite for a proper and 
secure continuation of lignite mining which, in turn, is necessary from an energy 
management perspective. 
When considering alternative energies, the Background Document specifies 
that a safe and secure energy supply of the population requires an effective energy 
mix which also includes the conversion of lignite into electricity reaching well 
into the 21st century. 
Experts attest that such potential alternative extraction methods as deep level 
mining, underwater extraction, and underground gasification are not alternatives 
applicable to lignite extraction in the Rhenish lignite mining district. 
To ensure the secure operation of open-pit mines, complete drainage is 
indispensable from a geohydrological point of view. 
Within the scope of the Explanatory Statement, all potential measures were 
tested for their applicability on groundwater bodies affected by drainage measures.  
These investigations also revealed that such technical measures as, for example, 
impermeable walls are not viable in the Rhenish lignite mining district. 
This was followed by an analysis of those measures which had been identified 
as being suitable with regard to the requirement of altering the good quantitative 
groundwater status with the least possible deviation: 
The State Planning Regulations included in the Lignite Mining Plan also define 
the actual mining site and its mining limits under the applicable water 
management and ecological aspects as was the case with the open-pit mine 
Garzweiler II, where an Executive Decision reached by the North Rhine-
Westphalian State Government (1991) reduced the mine’s initially intended total 
surface area by several kilometers due to, for example, water management and 
ecological issues (the so-called water management and ecological protection line) 
(considering the impact on the groundwater balance when determining mining 
limits). 
In any case, groundwater is abstracted only in such quantities as are absolutely 
necessary to safeguard the stability of slopes and bottoms in open-pit mines.  In 
addition, drainage waters are – as far as this is possible – assigned to the 

554 
T. Pabsch
 
appropriate water uses (for example, drinking and industrial water, ecowater, and 
immission protection), and/or the requisite water abstractions for external uses are 
also included in the drainage strategy (minimum drainage). 
Another option for reducing the adverse effects of groundwater abstraction on 
the quantitative status of groundwater bodies is to stabilize the groundwater table 
with infiltration and seepage measures.  These measures essentially focus on 
maintaining the groundwater level in groundwater-dependent areas deserving 
protection (in other words:  Groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems and 
surface waters), and they are well suited for this purpose depending on diverse 
general conditions such as, for example, intensity of groundwater abstraction, 
extent of the areas deserving protection, and available water resources (in 
particular, drainage water). 
Large-scale support was provided, for example, north of the open-pit mine 
Garzweiler, an area with widespread, interconnected groundwater-dependent 
wetlands.  This is done, on the one hand, by direct infiltration of drainage water 
into the groundwater body – via seepage trenches, dry wells, and injection lances 
– and, on the other hand, by stabilizing the water balance through surface 
discharge into flowing waters and wetlands.  Today, approximately 70 million m3 
of drainage water are discharged every year either directly and/or indirectly into 
the groundwater aquifers as so-called ecowater designed to stabilize the wetlands; 
by 2030, this amount is expected to increase to more than 100 million m3 per year.  
Normally, these seepages occur in the top aquifer; but depending on the specific 
hydrogeological conditions, an infiltration into deeper aquifers might also be 
useful in order to avoid lowering the upper aquifers (large-scale groundwater 
replenishment through reinfiltration of the drainage water). 
As is practiced in several wetlands, for example, along the inflows of the Rur 
River which originate in the Venloer Scholle region, it might also be reasonable to 
use groundwater abstracted from deeper aquifers as seepage water for the in-situ 
stabilization of the top aquifer. 
If the receiving waters are sufficiently effective as is the case with the Erft and 
Rur Rivers, then it is common practice to carry out water-compatible abstractions 
from these receiving waters and to feed them back into nearby terrestrial 
ecosystems (please see Figure 4) and smaller surface waters and/or to construct 
drainage channels which are also designed to stabilize groundwater-dependent 
terrestrial ecosystems and surface waters.  Additional specific individual 
groundwater conserving measures are coordinated with the respective public 
authorities in charge (in-situ groundwater stabilization and other in-situ measures). 
In addition to the requirement for supporting the water supply with substitute 
supplies of drainage water or water obtained from other sources, the Explanatory 
Statement substantiating the exemption also focuses on the mass deficit, the 
so-called residual holes, which remain in the aftermath of lignite mining.  So that 
raising the water level is accelerated in these residual holes (and/or then residual 
lakes) as well as in the surrounding groundwater bodies, water from external 
sources (often from efficient receiving waters in the vicinity) is fed into the 

“Exemptions” from the Management Objectives 
555
 
residual lakes which helps achieve a good quantitative status within a considerably 
shorter period of time.  Despite this infiltration of external waters, though, a sound 
water balance can only be expected decades after the lignite mining has ceased 
(substitute water supply, accelerated groundwater resurgence by filling residual 
lakes with water from external sources). 
 
 
Fig. 4 Diverse in-situ measures to stabilize groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems 
and surface waters along the Rur River east of the open-pit mine Inden 
The measures described above encompass anything that is technically feasible 
and practically suitable for reducing the adverse impact on the quantitative status 
of the groundwater body and its affiliated surface uses (groundwater-dependent 
terrestrial ecosystems and surface waters). 
According to a previously established categorization, the appropriate suitable 
measures were classified into six types and allocated to the affected groundwater 
bodies. These measures are implemented through the respective drainage, 
discharge, and seepage permits which are granted in accordance with the water 
law. 
In addition to the actual implementation, supervising the lowering of the 
groundwater, determining suitable measures, and supervising the effectiveness of 
such measures are all subject to comprehensive monitoring carried out by 
monitoring work groups which were specificially established in this regard and in 
which all involved and/or affected public authorities and institutions can 
participate.  For this purpose, the mining operator has all-embracing duties and 
obligations to cooperate and report (http://www.bezreg-koeln.nrw.de/brk_internet/ 
gremien/braunkohlenausschuss/monitoring/index.html).

3.2 
Exemptions from the Management Objectives  
for the Chemical Status of Groundwater 
The lowering of groundwater and the resultant aeration of the rock mass as well 
as, above all, the shifting of soil materials, which are to some extent sensitive to 
acidification, which might occur in the course of the lignite mining activities and 
the resultant physical intervention into the water body create hydrochemical 
processes inside the mine dump body during which the pyrites (FeS2) geogenically 
contained in the rocks are oxidized through aeration.  Along with the resurging 
groundwater, sulphate as well as iron and hydrogen ions are then released into the 
dump bodies of open-pit mines which is also accompanied in some sections by 
acidification and the dissolution of heavy metals – this depends on the specific 
hydrogeological conditions on site.  Locally, lignite residues in mine dumps also 
result in the formation of ammoniac nitrogen (NH4-N).  Any contamination with 
heavy metals, ammoniac nitrogen, and iron as well as any acidification are 
basically limited to the actual mine dump and/or its immediate runoff area.  Only 
sulphate, which exhibits as a substance essentially a conservative behavior, leads 
to increased sulphate contamination even in extended groundwater runoff sections 
of overburden dumps and, thus, also to a deterioration of the groundwater quality 
in such areas.  These contaminations inside the dump body and subsequently also 
in the groundwater runoff section result, in part, in a potential deviation from the 
management objectives pursuant to § 47 (formerly § 33 a Para. 1 of the WHG) 
according to which any detrimental changes in the chemical status of groundwater 
are to be avoided and any significant trends of increasing pollutant concentrations 
due to the impact of human activities are to be reversed. 
Currently, this deviation specifically exists in so-called “old dumpsites” of 
former open-pit lignite mines (along the open-pit mines Ville and Zukunft) as well 
as in outside dumps (for example, Sophienhöhe, Vollrather Höhe, Glessener 
Höhe). 
With regard to the existing groundwater contaminations, an exemption from the 
management objectives for the chemical groundwater status might initially be 
considered in accordance with the rules laid down in §47 and § 30 of the WHG 
(formerly § 33a Para. 4 Sent. 3 of the WHG under the provisions of § 25d Para. 1 
Nos. 1-4 of the WHG). 
Subsequent thereto, deviations may be made from the objectives to safeguard 
and assure a sound balance between groundwater abstraction and groundwater 
recharge as well as to maintain or achieve a good quantitative and chemical status 
of the groundwater by 2015; under certain conditions, less stringent management 
objectives may be determined as well. 
When it comes to lignite mining, these prerequites are met with regard to the 
actions lowering the groundwater and shifting the material which both trigger 
pyrite oxidation. 
Concerning the requirements of § 30 of the WHG (formerly No. 3 of § 25d 
Para. 1 of the WHG – avoidance of further deteterioration), the dynamic progress 

“Exemptions” from the Management Objectives 
557
 
of open-pit lignite mining needs to be mentioned here because it does not permit 
any clear differentiation between previous interventions into the groundwater 
balance as a result of ongoing human activities (the consequences of which have, 
in part, either already occurred or will, to some extent, only appear for the first 
time in the future) and new interventions and/or new changes associated with the 
future progress of the mining activities. 
Against this backdrop and in order to substantiate any deviations from the 
water protection objectives for groundwater, it was necessary to also take into 
acount § 47 and § 31 of the WHG (formerly § 33a Para. 4 Sent. 2 of the WHG in 
conjunction with § 25d Para. 3 Nos. 1-3 of the WHG – pursuant to Article 4 
Para. 7 of Directive 2000/60/EC dated October 23, 2000) so as to keep abreast 
with the changes that are already foreseeable today. 
An exemption from the management objectives for the chemical groundwater 
status may, under certain conditions, be granted if there is any change in the 
groundwater level due to drainage measures carried out in the course of lignite 
extraction as well as the requisite physical change to the water (shifting the 
groundwater body) and the detrimental changes which ultimately occur as a result 
of the aforementioned changes (in order to avoid repetitions with similar contents, 
only the new aspects are mentioned below): 
Significant influencing variables for deviations in the chemical status from the 
management objectives as a result of pyrite oxidation are the presence of pyrite in 
the rock mass, the contact of pyrites with oxygen, and groundwater resurgence.  
Deviations from the management objectives are, therefore, avoidable if one of 
these three conditions can be prevented.  The following options were examined: 
The presence of pyrites is geogenically determined and inseparably linked to 
the lignite deposit; it can, thus, not be avoided.  The contact of the pyrites with 
oxygen results primarily from shifting the overburden above the lignite and the 
associated lowering of the groundwater. 
Ultimately, the resurgence of groundwater is supposed to be consistent with the 
objective of a good quantitative status, which is to be achieved again after lignite 
extraction has ended, and is unavoidable if this objective is to be met.  That is why 
pyrite oxidation in the overburden dumps of open-pit lignite mines and the 
mobilization of its products along with the resurgence of groundwater cannot be 
avoided. 
Initially, potential measures were determined; this was followed by an 
examination of their applicability to the affected groundwater bodies.  Next, those 
measures were identified which are neither technically feasible nor productive 
such as, for example, mine dump sealing systems. 
This was then followed by an analysis of all suitable measures which need to be 
undertaken to reduce any potential detrimental effects on the chemical status of 
the groundwater resulting from dewatering the rock mass and dumping the 
overburden. 
When shifting the material during the extraction and dumping process, 
overburden masses with higher pyrite contents are primarily dumped into lower 

558

sections while upper dump sections are primarily built from overburden masses 
with lower pyrite contents.  In places where it is useful from a geohydrological 
point of view and where it is possible due to the mass disposition of the pertinent 
overburden material, the dump section adjacent to the upper groundwater aquifer 
(also referred to as dump ridge) has to have as little pyrite as possible in it 
(selective dumping; the so-called A1 measure). 
Another method of reducing pyrite oxidation is to minimize the air exposure of 
those layers which exhibit higher pyrite contents in such a way that the bottoms of 
open-pit mines – where in-situ layers of near-surface materials are exposed to air 
for a longer period of time – are relocated to areas exhibiting the lowest possible 
pyrite contents (optimized location of bottoms; the so-called A2 measure). 
If the pyrite contents increase for geological reasons, then limestone is added to 
the overburden masses during dumping.  Even though it is actually impossible to 
reduce pyrite oxidation by adding limestone, this addition accelerates the 
immobilization of the resultant secondary products and raises the pH value once 
again to almost neutral ranges (liming of dumps; the so-called A6 measure; please 
see Figure 5). 
The specific on-site conditions prevailing at the open-pit mine Garzweiler 
provide the opportunity of arranging retention wells even retroactively in the 
dump’s groundwater runoff section.  With the help of these retention wells, 
sulfate-contaminated water can be removed, subsequently cleaned, and finally 
infiltrated into the groundwater aquifer again.  However, a decision on this 
potential measure can only be reached decades after groundwater resurgence and 
groundwater runoff commenced (option of retention wells). 
Depending on the degree of any potential qualitative impairment resulting from 
pyrite oxidation products running off from the dumps and depending on specific 
alternatives, it might be useful and/or necessary to relinquish the water supply at 
least partially at that location and to move it to a different location and/or to a 
groundwater horizon which is not and/or less affected by any dump water runoffs 
(adjustment of water supply locations and horizons). 
In line with the previously established categorization, the appropriate suitable 
measures were classified into four types and allocated to the affected groundwater 
bodies.  These measures are implemented through the respective approvals and 
permits granted by the District Government Arnsberg in accordance with the 
mining and water laws and subject to monitoring.  The measures outlined above 
exploit all options that are technically feasible and practically suitable to reduce 
pyrite oxidation and its resultant secondary products, and they also help reduce the 
runoff volume of these secondary products into the top groundwater aquifers 
which, in turn, play an important role in water management.

Exemption from the Management Objectives for Surface 
Waters in Association with the Introduction of Drainage 
Water from Lignite Mining 
Pursuant to § 27 (formerly § 25a) of the WHG, surface waters, provided that they 
are not classified as artificial or substantially modified, are to be managed in such 
a way that any adverse changes in their ecological and chemical status are avoided 
and that a good ecological and chemical status is maintained or achieved. 
The drainage activities may affect surface waters in the river basin subdistricts 
of the Erft, Rur, Niers, and Schwalm Rivers. 
When it comes to larger bodies of water (specifically the Rur and Erft Rivers), 
lowering the groundwater entails a loss of groundwater contact at least in some 
areas and, thus, reduces the runoff volume.  In contrast, the runoff volume 
increases through the introduction of drainage waters into the Erft and/or Inde 
Rivers (and via the latter, also into the Rur River).  It is, in particular, the Erft 
River into which so much drainage water is introduced – even though this 
drainage water is already used, to a large extent, directly and/or indirectly via the 
Erft River to supply the power plants along the Erft River – that it is currently 
overcompensated to a large extent as a result of the reduced runoff volume caused 
by the lowering of the groundwater which, in turn, changes the runoff system of 
this water body and has, at least during low water periods, a formative influence 
on runoffs occurring in the lower stretch of the Erft River.

Since the mid-20th century, the industrial extraction of lignite has required the 
large-scale drainage of groundwater as described above.  In order to discharge this 
drainage water, but also to improve flood protection, the Erft River was expanded 
several times.  Increased runoff volumes permit the extraction of cooling water for 
lignite power plants.  Most of the accumulated drainage waters are fed into the 
Erft River near Bergheim.  It should be noted at this point that diverse additional 
morphological changes were made to the Erft River which occurred independent 
of lignite mining (melioration and straightening for the draining of the Erftaue 
floodplain, flood protection measures).  The information provided in the 
Background Document, however, focuses exclusively on mining-related topics 
(achieving the objectives of lignite mining and its conversion into electricity) and, 
thus, on the introduction of drainage water. 
Even when it comes to its qualitative properties, the introduction of drainage 
water has an impact on the chemical and ecological status of flowing waters.  
Compared to natural flowing waters, drainage waters exhibit, geogenically 
determined, relatively low oxygen contents, increased iron and sulfate contents as 
well as higher temperatures.  In conjunction with the drainage water volume that is 
introduced, the resultant high heat load causes the Erft River to warm up 
particularly in the winter and, when considering a period of one year, entails an 
unnatural homogenization of temperatures over the entire year. 
Due to the dynamic progress in lignite mining and the associated changes in the 
volume and quality of the drainage waters that are introduced and due to the 
various new measures that need to be undertaken (particularly limiting the heat 
load supply and the associated medium-term and long-term reduction of drainage 
water volumes that are introduced as well as the ecological transformation of the 
water bed), the situation – particularly along the Erft River’s lower stretch – is 
subject to changes which are designed to trigger the transformation of the Erft 
River’s lower stretch into a good chemical and ecological status (and/or potential). 
For example, a reduction of the drainage water volumes that are introduced, 
which is indispensable in the long run, results in an increased concentration of 
diverse water body contents originating from upstream riparians (for example, 
phosphate) because the thinning effect of the introduced drainage waters 
decreases.  Furthermore, the reduced flow rate leads to reduced flow velocities and 
longer retention times in impoundment sections with the associated ecologically 
negative, reinforced oxygen consumption processes.  Even though these negative 
trends are to be counteracted with parallel measures, it cannot be completely ruled 
out that the status of partial sections along the lower stretch of the Erft River will 
deteriorate temporarily due to the new changes revolving around the introduction 
of drainage waters resulting from the lowering of the groundwater as well as the 
intended physical changes to the Erft River’s lower stretch. 
Similar to the Erft River, but to a much smaller extent, the impact on surface 
waters also applies to the discharge into smaller water bodies (for example, the 
upper stretches of the Niers, Schwalm, and Mühlenbach Rivers) into which treated 

“Exemptions” from the Management Objectives 
561
 
drainage water is introduced in order to prevent them from desiccation; this type 
of impact is, though, not relevant for the Rur and Inde Rivers. 
In accordance with the provisions of § 30 (formerly § 25d Para. 1) of the WHG, 
a deviation from the management objectives for the ecological and chemical status 
of surface waters and/or the specification of less stringent management objectives 
for surface waters are initially taken into consideration for the current 
introductions to, utilizations, and/or impairments of surface waters which are 
necessary to safeguard a secure and effective lignite extraction in the Rhenish 
lignite mining district.  And less stringent objectives can be determined thereafter 
provided that certain prerequisites are met. 
Pursuant to § 30 (formerly Nos. 1, 2, and 4 of § 25d) of the WHG, any lowering 
of the groundwater on behalf of lignite mining and the resultant introduction of 
drainage water into the Erft River which is changed over time due to the dynamic 
development of open-pit lignite mines is also subject to § 47 and § 31 of the WHG 
(formerly § 33a Para. 4 Sent. 2 of the WHG in conjunction with § 25d Para. 3 
Nos. 1-3 of the WHG in accordance with Article 4 Para. 7 of Directive 
2000/60/EC dated October 23, 2000). 
According to the aforementioned provisions and provided that certain 
prerequisites are met, any deviation from the management objectives for the 
ecological and chemical status of surface waters may be admitted, on the one 
hand, on account of any changes in the physical properties of surface waters and, 
on the other hand, on account of any changes in the groundwater level and any 
related, ultimately resultant adverse changes in surface waters (in order to avoid 
repetitions with similar contents regarding some of the prerequisites, only the new 
aspects are mentioned below): 
The physical changes occurring in the form of ecological transformation,  
which the water body of the Erft River’s lower stretch will undergo over the  
next few decades, are of greater public interest as was ascertained in the  
Concept for the Future on the ecological transformation of the Erft River  
region (http://www.erftverband.de/oberirdische-gewaesser/gewaesserbewirtschaftung/ 
erftumgestaltung.html).  This Concept for the Future also outlines in detail that the 
selected combination of measures cannot be replaced and/or altered by any other 
measures which would have had a significantly lower adverse impact on the 
environment and which would not have been associated with a disproportionately 
greater effort: 
Due to the historic anthropogenic changes to water bodies and the extraction of 
lignite since the 20th century for the supply of energy and power, the lower stretch 
of the Erft River located in the Rhenish lignite mining district is affected 
specifically by the impact of lowering the groundwater to dewater the mining 
sections and the associated introduction of drainage waters in such a way that any 
adverse change to these water bodies cannot be avoided and that their good 
ecological and chemical status can neither be maintained nor attained by 2015. 
It would only be possible to avoid the above mentioned changes in the thermal-
physical properties of the Erft River’s lower stretch if at least one of the two factors 
“increased temperature” or “introduced drainage water volume” was removed.

The water temperature of the discharged drainage waters is geogenically 
determined; drainage water is already used by the power plants located in the 
region, by industrial and commercial enterprises, for the public water supply, 
wetlands, and other ecowater introductions, and it also meets the on-site demand 
of open-pit mines.  Any extended use of drainage water in remote regions would 
include more energy being consumed to transport the water as well as the 
landscape being impaired by the requisite construction of additional pipelines.  In 
addition, longer pipelines also reduce the secure and sustained supply for water 
utilization.  Expanding the water utilization is, thus, neither technically viable nor 
ecologically useful. 
Another method of discharging drainage waters would generally be feasible 
from a technical point of view by transferring these drainage waters to the Rhine 
River.  However, within the scope of the project “Transformation of the Erft River 
Region According to the Water Framework Directive” launched by the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, 
Agriculture, and Consumer Protection (MUNLV) (today’s Ministry for Climate 
Protection, the Environment, Nature Conservation, Agriculture, and Consumer 
Protection (MKUNLV)), it was ascertained in 2004 that the introduced drainage 
water also has a positive, i.e. thinning, effect on the concentration of nutrients and 
other harmful substances and pollutants.  Any timely, significant reduction of the 
drainage water volume introduced into the Erft River would, thus, result in a 
substantial increase in the concentration of nutrients and pollutants.  But it would 
also cause a considerable decrease in the flow velocities and, thus, increase the 
oxygen consumption processes in impoundments and slow flowing sections 
which, in turn, would have a significant, negative impact on the flora and fauna of 
the lower stretch of the Erft River.  That is why any timely significant reduction of 
the drainage water volume introduced into the Erft River is counterproductive 
from an ecological point of view; it can only be implemented in conjunction with 
a long-term morphological transformation of the Erft River’s lower stretch along 
with the respective reduction of the influx of nutrients and other harmful 
substances and pollutants from the Erft River’s medium stretch. 
In order to ascertain and implement suitable measures designed to reduce the 
adverse effects of both the mining-related hydraulic and thermodynamic stress on 
the lower stretch of the Erft River and the stress factors that are not related to 
mining, 
the 
MUNLV 
(today’s 
MKULNV) 
had 
initiated 
the 
project 
“Transformation of the Erft River Region According to the Water Framework 
Directive” (or, more precisely:  The lower stretch of the Erft River) in 2004. 
Within the scope of this project, the decisive influencing factors on the 
chemical and ecological status of the Erft River were initially examined, and 
potential measures were investigated in order to avoid/reduce these influences. 
As a key measure designed to improve the ecological status along the Erft 
River, a decision was reached in favor of transforming the Erft River region 
pursuant to the Water Framework Directive.  This will be implemented with the 
participation of the RWE Power AG corporation in accordance with a general 
agreement that had been concluded between the MUNLV (today’s MKULNV), 

“Exemptions” from the Management Objectives 
563
 
the Erftverband water management association, and the RWE Power AG 
corporation in September 2008. 
Another decision was reached in favor of additional drainage water aeration 
because of its basically positive ecological impact and comparably low costs.  It 
should be noted in this context that RWE Power AG had carried out the aeration 
of drainage waters at two significant discharge points already before 2004. 
Also with regard to iron, RWE Power AG already conducts diverse measures 
for the deferrization of drainage waters (operation of mine water purification 
plants and sedimentation basins, optimized control and monitoring of drainage and 
discharge systems). 
Various measures designed to avoid/reduce the hydraulic and thermodynamic 
stress on the lower stretch of the Erft River have already been discussed above.  
These measures include, on the one hand, a reduction of the drainage water 
volume by minimizing the actual groundwater abstraction and, on the other hand, 
the extensive use of drainage water for water supply purposes.  In addition, 
various other methods of discharging drainage waters were also analyzed in the 
above mentioned study with the result that any timely, significant reduction of 
drainage waters prior to implementing any other measures (morphological 
transformation of the Erft River region, treatment of precipitation water) would 
not only be extremely cost-intensive, but also ecologically counterproductive. 
Due to the significant influence which the introduction of drainage water has on 
the Erft River’s heat balance, the heat load, though, needs to be limited in the 
future – in line with the stipulations of the project “Transformation of the Erft 
River Region According to the Water Framework Directive” – in order to prevent 
any resultant deterioration of the ecological water body status.  That is why the 
alternative of a “constant heat load” was selected from among a number of 
scenarios that had been examined for the introduction of drainage water (please 
see Figure 6).  This alternative focuses on the introduction of drainage water until 
the end of the mining operations while also considering the ban on deterioration 
pursuant to the Water Framework Directive.  This means that depending on the – 
geogenically determined – continuously increasing temperature of the raised 
groundwater level, the approved discharge volume, which currently amounts to 
8.5 m3/s, will decrease to 7.6 m3/s over the next couple of years.  Limiting the heat 
load, as mentioned above, also results in further limiting the iron load.

Fig. 6 Scenarios for the future development of drainage water discharge 
The measures focusing on additional drainage water aeration and the idea of a 
“constant heat load” were already implemented.  A period of approximately 
40 years was mentioned in the Concept for the Future as the time horizon for the 
morphological transformation of the lower stretch of the Erft River which had also 
been part of the decision. 
This period of time is based, on the one hand, on the scope and intensity of the 
transformation (transformation of a 40 kilometer long, technically developed river 
stretch with diverse dams into an approximately 53 kilometer long flowing water 
in line with the Water Framework Directive) but, on the other hand, also on the 
population density and utilization intensity of the affected region which requires 
an intensive, technically and legally substantiated coordination of individual 
measures with all the stakeholders and the public at large.  It will, thus, not be 
possible to morphologically transfer and accordingly transform the entire lower 
stretch of the Erft River into a good ecological and chemical status for its surface 
waters so that it meets the requirements of the EC Water Framework Directive 
within the deadline set for 2015.

Management Plan and Program of Measures 
The Management Plan for the North Rhine-Westphalian sections of the Rhine, 
Weser, Ems, and Maas Rivers lists the exemptions for lignite mining. 

“Exemptions” from the Management Objectives 
565
 
The current situation of lignite mining is described in Chapter 6 Status of 
Surface Waters and Chapter 7 Status of the Groundwater with reference to the 
Background Document.  Additional details are included in Chapter 8 Analysis of 
Human Activities and the Significant Contamination of Water Bodies.  
Item 10.6.4.1 Lignite Mining of Subchapter 10.6.4 Less Stringent Management 
Objectives in North Rhine-Westphalia which is a part of Chapter 10 Management 
Objectives for Individual Water Bodies contains exemption clauses for lignite 
mining which are in accordance with Article 4 Para. 5 of the Water Framework 
Directive (exemption from achieving the objectives) as well as in accordance with 
Article 4 Para. 7 of the Water Framework Directive (exemption from the ban on 
deterioration).  These exemption clauses are abbreviated as A2 and A4. 
The Program of Measures 
(http://wrrl.flussgebiete.nrw.de/Dokumente/NRW/ 
Bewirtschaftungsplan_2010_2015/Ma__nahmenprogramm/Ma__nahmenprogram
m_NRW_Gesamtdokument.pdf) for the North Rhine-Westphalian sections of the 
Rhine, Weser, Ems, and Maas Rivers is basically limited to those water bodies 
which require mandatory reports to the EC, i.e. limited to all flowing waters 
having a catchment area of more than 10 km2, to lakes having a surface area of 
more than 0.5 km2, and to groundwater bodies.  A summary of the Program of 
Measures is also included as Chapter 8 of the Management Plan. 
In addition, the “planning unit profiles” contain tabulations listing the particular 
measures that are intended for each water body group.  The requisite measures are 
described programmatically; namely, with the help of a “catalog name,” a specific 
description, information on the supporting entity or entities of the measures as 
well as the respective implementation period (2012, 2015, or 2021/2027). 
Reference to the exemptions for lignite mining was made in the Program of 
Measures.  Chapter 6 Measures to Reduce the Contamination of 
Groundwater, for example, refers to Chapter 10 of the Management Plan which 
does not specify the planning of any additional measures in the lignite mining 
sector because comprehensive measures designed to reduce the impact of lignite 
mining are already implemented within the scope of lignite mining operations and 
because a detailed description of the correlations is already included in the 
Background Document on Lignite. 
The Concept for the Future of the Erft River Region is mentioned in 
Chapter 8.1 Measures for Specific Cases and Other Contaminations.  The 
renaturation and development of the Erft River is, thus, indispensable for the 
50 km stretch which is influenced by drainage water.  According to the timeline, 
this is to be gradually implemented in chronological phases; short-term measures 
by 2015, medium-term measures by 2027, and long-term measures by 2045.  The 
time horizons 2015 and 2027 not only permit the realization of this transformation 
process, but at the same time also the objectives set by the EC Water Framework 
Directive and the requirements of the Water Management Act.  The time horizon 
2045 is dependent on the discontinuation of drainage water discharge after open-
pit mining has ceased.  The estimated total costs for the “Concept for the Future of 
the Erft River Region until 2045” add up to approximately 95 million euros.

Outlook 
The requirements for water protection will be pursued with great effort by the 
mining operator and continue to be subject to intense monitoring by the public 
authorities.  The transformation of the Erft River region is already underway.  For 
this purpose, a Water Body Implementation Schedule was prepared in  
2013 (http://www.erftverband.de/oberirdische-gewaesser/gewaesserbewirtschaftung/ 
umsetzungsfahrplan/). 
In those areas where drainage water is introduced along the Erft River, the 
requirement of a constant heat load will be consistently pursued in a strategic 
manner.  The mining operator will make major investments in this regard. 
Comprehensive data and information on the current situation of surface waters 
and groundwater resources in North Rhine-Westphalia were compiled in the 
updated Regional Survey of the Water Framework Directive which was completed 
in late 2013.  A state-wide summary of this Regional Survey will be published in 
2014 as a separate report. 
With the publication of the “Significant Water Management Issues” in 
2013/2014, the second phase of public participation in preparing the second 
Management Plan commenced.  The report provides an overview of the current 
situation of the North Rhine-Westphalian water bodies and groundwater bodies 
and presents those aspects which are important in implementing the EC Water 
Framework 
Directive 
http://www.flussgebiete.nrw.de/img_auth.php/d/db/ 
WWBF_2013_WEB.pdf. 
Both the Management Plan and the Program of Measures will remain in effect 
until December 22, 2015, and need to be updated in accordance with § 84 of the 
WHG by the end of 2015.  North Rhine-Westphalia’s contributions to the 
Management Plans for the Rhine, Weser, Ems, and Maas Rivers are to be adopted 
by the State Government by December 22, 2015, and they shall become 
compulsory and binding for the public authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia.  
The described exemption clauses for lignite mining are adjusted therein.

Securing Final and Border Slopes in the Open-
Pit Lignite Mines of the Rhenish Mining District 
from the Perspective of the Mining Authority 
Rolf Petri 
Bezirksregierung Arnsberg Abteilung 6 Bergbau und Energie NRW, Düren, Germany

Characteristic Features of the Rhenish Lignite Mining 
District 
The Rhenish mining district in North Rhine-Westphalia has a deposit volume of 
35 billion tons of economically extractable reserves; thus, making it one of the 
most significant lignite deposits in Germany and Europe. Over more than 
100 years, a mining industry has evolved which is concentrated in the three large-
scale open-pit mines Garzweiler, Hambach, and Inden of the mining company 
RWE Power AG today.  Approximately 100 million tons of lignite are mined 
every year and used primarily to generate electricity. 
The lignite deposits in the Lower Rhine Basin date back to the Tertiary Period.  
The overburden consists of loosely packed sedimentary rock mass originating in 
the Quaternary and the Tertiary Periods.  It has a series of water bearing and water 
storing layers arranged in several groundwater horizons.  For mining, the overbur-
den has to be dewatered in several steps all the way to the seam floor.  Up to three 
lignite seams with a total thickness of about 60 m are available for mining.  The 
underlying stratum of the oldest seam is found at depths of up to 420 m below the 
terrain’s surface.  The deposit consists of several fault systems running from the 
southeast to the northwest in four blocks. 
At some of the faults, slow tectonic shifts as well as earthquakes occur even to-
day.  The Lower Rhine Basin is one of Germany’s most earthquake prone regions; 
although in a comparison with the rest of the world, Central Europe has to be clas-
sified as a region with few earthquakes.  Yet more than 1,000 quakes have been 
registered since exact measurements and recordings were first taken in 1955; the 
strongest one occurred on April 13, 1992 with a magnitude of 5.9. 
The region in which the lignite is mined used to be originally characterized by 
agriculture.  Due to the high earnings resulting from the agriculture and the steadi-
ly expanding commercial and industrial sector as well as an excellent infrastruc-
ture, the population density is higher than 500 inhabitants per km2 and  
corresponds to the median population density of North Rhine-Westphalia while 
the average for the Federal Republic of Germany is considerably lower at an aver-
age value of 226 inhabitants per km2.

Lignite mining in the Lower Rhine Basin faces primarily the following prob-
lems: 
• 
Considerable water management efforts have to be undertaken to dewater 
the open-pit mines 
• 
Thick overburden layers and, thus, considerable extraction depths 
• 
Additional seismic stress 
• 
High conflict potential with the people and the business community in the 
surrounding region due to several relocations and many points of contact 
between the mining operation and the neighborhood 
It is due to the above mentioned issues that the safe and secure construction of 
open-pit border slopes and final slopes assumes a particularly important role.

District Government Arnsberg as the Mining Authority  
in North Rhine-Westphalia 
The official approval and monitoring of the safe operation of lignite open-pit 
mines in the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) are the duties and 
responsibility of the District Government Arnsberg, Department of Mining and 
Energy in North Rhine-Westphalia, which is the responsible mining supervisory 
authority for the entire state.  Within the scope of its responsibilities associated 
with mining supervision, the governmental office regulates and monitors also the 
safe and secure construction of open-pit slopes. 
3 
Elements of State Lignite Planning as the First Step  
in Safety 
Border slopes, which are created along the excavation boundary of an open-pit 
mine, as well as permanent final slopes are subject to a two-step safety concept in 
the governmental planning and approval process. 
During the first step, the mining is delimited in the so-called lignite plan.  Lig-
nite plans are important elements in North Rhine-Westphalia’s regional planning.  
They are created in a special regional governmental board, the lignite committee, 
to plan an open-pit mining project or relocations and are approved by the state 
government.  In the lignite plans for mining projects, a safety zone is already fixed 
by determining the excavation boundary and safety line in accordance to the pro-
visions1 of the State Planning Act.  The stipulations of the lignite plans have to be 
observed by all governmental offices in their respective approval procedures. 
The excavation boundary specified in the lignite plan includes the excavation 
area within which the extraction of lignite has priority above and beyond other

utilizations and functional claims.  During the later mining approval procedure, 
which is based on the lignite plan, mining may only be approved within the exca-
vation boundary.  The excavation boundary represents the inner boundary of the 
so-called safety zone while the outer boundary of this zone is formed by the safety 
line which is specified by parcels.  The safety zone is the section between the edge 
of the excavation/dump site and the safety line whose width is based primarily on 
mining safety related aspects.  Its width usually corresponds to either half the 
depth or even the full depth of the open-pit mine at the site in question, but at least 
100 m.  The safety line encloses and surrounds that area which would be affected 
directly by excavation and/or dumping activities taking place on the terrain’s sur-
face.  It is in particular in this area, if it should prove to be necessary, that meas-
ures can be undertaken against hazards and any other issues associated with min-
ing.  This zone also provides room for operational measures and facilities, for 
example, wells and pipes, to dewater open-pit mines as well as installations which 
are used for emission control during the time of operation.  When approving the 
general operating plan for mining, the mining authority makes the excavation 
boundary and the safety zone legally binding for the mine operator. 
4 
Approvals in Accordance with the Mining Law  
as the Second Step in Safety 
While a first safety element comes into existence by determining a horizontal 
distance on the terrain’s surface during lignite planning, the creation of a stable 
slope system comes into play during the second step of the safety concept.  Geo-
metrically, this applies to the design of the general incline of the slope which is 
defined as the angle of the line between the upper edge of the slope and the lowest 
part of the slope’s toe above the horizontal.  The general incline of the slope is 
determined by the inclination of the individual slopes and the corresponding num-
ber and width of the berms structuring and dividing the entire slope.  This second 
safety element assumes a particular, decisive role in the practical application. 
The mining authority demands proof of the stability attuned to individual cases 
for all relevant border and final slope systems of an open-pit mine in the course of 
the official mining approval procedure authorizing the general operating plan and 
also subsequently at regular intervals when submitting the special operating plans.

Guideline for Stability as a Generally Accepted Code  
of Practice 
To examine and evaluate the stability of border slopes and permanent slopes in 
open-pit lignite mines and the requisite elevated dumps as well as the residual 
mining lakes, the generally accepted code of safety practice in North Rhine-

Westphalia is the District Government Arnsberg’s Guideline2 for Investigating the 
Stability of Slopes in Open-Pit Lignite Mines in its most recent version containing 
the first supplement dated August 8, 2013 – 61.19.1-2-1.  It describes the require-
ments which need to be considered in the verification procedure.  According to the 
stipulations of the Mining Ordinance for Lignite Mines, it is necessary to furnish 
proof of the stability of the border slopes and final slopes.  This proof is to be 
submitted by the mining company already during the planning phase and has to be 
approved by the mining authority prior to its implementation. 
The stability can be verified via: 
• 
Geotechnical investigations (geological, hydrogeological, and geome-
chanical studies) 
• 
Surveying documents 
• 
Calculations of the stability 
• 
Evaluations of the stability 
• 
Results of monitoring measures 
The mining authority generally determines already while examining the general 
and main operating plans for which slopes it is necessary to prepare stability cal-
culations. 
The requirements for stability need to be given sufficient consideration already 
while planning the slopes.  That is why the preliminary exploration of the geologi-
cal and hydrological conditions needs to be carried out in a timely manner.

A Requirement for Stability Calculations 
Stability calculations are needed as essential evaluation criteria for verification in 
line with the Mining Ordinance for Lignite Mines if and when the stability cannot 
be taken for granted on the basis of previous experiences and evidence. 
Stability calculations are generally to be prepared if and when: 
• 
The stability cannot be considered as given after the geotechnical investi-
gations have been properly assessed; 
• 
any objects in need of protection (e.g. special buildings, industrial plants, 
traffic structures, supply and waste disposal pipes, flowing bodies of wa-
ter, retaining structures, nature reserves) are found in the area bordering 
on the slope’s edge; 
• 
any ground conditions that favor landslides (e.g. tectonic stress zones, 
stratum boundaries or strata with little stability, adverse hydrological 
conditions, additional static loads or vibrations and tremors, for example, 
due to transportation infrastructures, old mining structures, coal pillars or 
permanent coal pillars, former dump sites) are present; or 
• 
the mining authority demands it in individual cases.

Stability calculations are to be carried out while using the results of the geo-
technical investigations which were conducted in procedures which are appropri-
ate for the actual local conditions and conform to the state of technology.   
Generally speaking, calculations are to be carried out using both averaged as well 
as adverse soil mechanical parameters; the influence of the characteristic value 
approach on the stability is to be determined through comparison calculations. 
7 
Calculation Methods for Different Fracture Mechanisms 
The applicable calculation methods and calculation programs along with the doc-
uments needed for the verification are to be submitted to the mining authority for 
approval.  That is why the calculation methods were verified and officially con-
firmed for: 
• 
Fracture mechanisms with circular slip lines (slice procedures) 
• 
Composite fracture mechanisms with straight slip lines (rigid body method) 
In many cases, it is often possible to realistically describe fracture mechanisms 
with the help of circular slip lines.  Geological cross-sections depicting the strata, 
faults, and strata boundaries as well as miscellaneous weak zones, groundwater 
levels and/or dewatering objectives, and the slope’s geometry are to be prepared 
before determining the potential slip lines for the slope area under investigation.  
The slope area under investigation is to be divided into perpendicular slices which 
correspond to the loose rock layers dissected by the slip lines.  The calculation 
method is, thus, called the slice procedure; it is described in more detail in the 
DIN standard 4084. 
The slip lines under investigation are to be specified while taking the instable 
geomechanical zones into account.  The slip lines, which are decisive for adverse 
stability, are to be ascertained mathematically. 
When residual water is present in the sector of the slope under investigation, 
then it is necessary to consider the pore water pressure with regard to the height of 
the water level and the specific weight of the water saturated soil.  If present, the 
additional static loads influencing the slope body need to be also considered. 
The stability is calculated according to BISHOP’s method which is explained 
with examples in DIN 4084.  It is also possible to carry out additional stability 
calculations which have been tested in open-pit lignite mining (e.g. the B.O.R. or 
JANBU methods).  BISHOP’s calculation method can only be used for plain cy-
lindrical slip surfaces; for straight slip line sections and/or fracture sections, calcu-
lations need to be carried out using the methods described below. 
Due to the tectonic conditions in the Rhenish lignite mining district, it is neces-
sary to also consider for fracture mechanisms that reach deeper into the ground 
slip lines that run straight in sections due to instable zones which are predeter-
mined by the rock mass.  The individual fracture blocks can only move parallel to 
the external slip lines.  The procedure that is also called the rigid body method 
considers fracture mechanisms which are kinematically possible and which can be 
clearly solved mathematically.  This method is also described in DIN 4084.  The 

572 
R. Petri
 
 
procedure is to be used primarily for fracture blocks for which the location of the 
external and internal slip lines is clearly determined by geomechanically instable 
zones, such as, for example, thin clay horizons and faults.  The investigation is to 
be carried out for the most adverse fracture mechanisms. 
To ascertain the stability coefficient η according to FELLENIUS, a uniform 
reduction is carried out for the shear strength parameters of all slip lines. 
The specific values which are used in the stability calculations to describe the 
soil mechanical properties come from the soil mechanical field and laboratory 
investigations.  The mining company has been operating a certified geomechanical 
and soil mechanical test lab for many decades. 
8 
Assessing the Stability 
When assessing whether the slope is stable, it is necessary to take the previous 
experiences into account while using the results of the geotechnical investigations, 
the surveying documents, and the calculation results. 
If stability calculations need to be carried out, then the necessary stability coef-
ficient needs to be specified and substantiated depending on the extent of the geo-
technical investigations, the reliability of the applied characteristic geomechanical 
values while also considering the risk potential of the objects found in the sector 
of the slope’s edge that need to be protected, the scheduled lifetime of the slope, 
and the protection of the deposit for each sectional plane under consideration. 
The mathematically determined stability coefficient η of individual slopes and 
slope systems has to be above 1.0 for the worst case scenario. 
For objects that need to be protected in the sector of the slope’s edge and for 
permanent slopes, the stability coefficient has to be at least 1.3 for the slope sys-
tem.  When this value is not reached, then an explanation has to be given for each 
individual case. 
When assessing the stability of slopes, it is also possible to take into account 
the spatial restraints of the slope’s toe as well as the measures designed to main-
tain or increase the stability and to monitor the slope.  And the intended utilization 
has to be taken into consideration as well. 
9 
Considering Earthquakes 
Due to the seismic features of the Rhenish lignite mining district, the impact of 
potential earthquakes has to be also considered for permanent slopes of residual 
lakes and elevated dumps.  This is investigated with the help of pseudo-static or 
dynamic methods. 
The prerequisite for investigations applying these methods is the absence of li-
quefaction effects in the materials with which the slopes are actually constructed.  
That is why the permanent slope has to be designed and built in such a way that 

Securing Final and Border Slopes in the Open-Pit Lignite Mines  
573
 
 
soil and/or ground liquefaction is not to be feared.  The mining company has to 
properly demonstrate this. 
When the pseudo-static method is used, the forces that come into play during 
earthquakes are either considered to be part of the gravitational acceleration (k 
being classified as the “seismic coefficient”) or the peak ground acceleration 
caused by earthquakes (χ being the “pseudo-static coefficient”).  The value do-
main of the seismic coefficient k varies from region to region and the more so, the 
stronger the earthquake is that is to be anticipated for a particular region.  When 
using the pseudo-static coefficient χ, the magnitude of the earthquake which is to 
be anticipated is factored in using the peak ground acceleration PGA. 
In order to validate the applicability of the selected pseudo-static method for 
the specific case of elevated dumps and residual lakes in the Rhenish lignite min-
ing district, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Triantafyllidis was commissioned by the District Gov-
ernment Arnsberg to prepare an expert’s report.3  By using dynamic calculation 
methods, he carried out a retrograde calculation of the pseudo-static coefficient 
which is to be used in pseudo-static methods.  It was, thus, possible to demonstrate 
that the pseudo-static calculation which was used in this approach can come up 
with results that are at least equivalent to those of the dynamic methods. 
Determining the recurrence intervals and ascertaining the respective ground ac-
celerations for the stability verification is to be carried out as follows: 
• 
For permanent slope systems of residual lakes: 
o 
Until the final water level is reached (filling phase): 
Design basis earthquake 1 – recurrence interval T = 500 years 
o 
After having reached the final water level (final state): 
Design basis earthquake 2 – recurrence interval T = 2,500 
years 
• 
For permanent individual slopes of residual lakes and permanent slopes 
of elevated dumps:Design basis earthquake 1 – recurrence interval T = 
500 years 
Design basis earthquake 1 – recurrence interval T = 500 years 
The definition of these data is carried out as per DIN 19700-104 whereby large 
dams of the Category 1 are to be assigned a recurrence interval of 2,500 years for 
a global failure due to earthquake damage (probability of occurrence 4*10-4).  
Compared to Eurocode 8, slope systems of residual lakes actually get higher acce-
leration rates (recurrence interval Eurocode 8:  T = 475 years).  The calculation for

the residual lake slopes is, thus, designed to take a possible later land use into 
account which is to meet the requirements of DIN EN 1998 (Eurocode 8).5 
The peak ground acceleration (PGA) on the terrain surface is to be ascertained 
either via the site-specific data retrieval of seismic hazards from the German Re-
search Centre for Geosciences Potsdam (GFZ Potsdam)6 or via a site-specific 
seismic report of the Geological Service North Rhine-Westphalia (GD NRW), or 
any other competent agency.  When the acceleration of the bedrock is to be ascer-
tained, it is necessary to consider ground reinforcement due to the existing sedi-
ment cover. 
The horizontal and vertical components of an earthquake’s side effects are as-
sumed to be acting simultaneously in the calculation.  The acceleration is always 
considered to be a horizontal component moving in the direction of the open 
slope.  For vertical acceleration, both possible directions are to be considered in 
different calculation steps.  If information is only available on the horizontal seis-
mic acceleration, then the vertical acceleration is to be ascertained from it with the 
factor 0.7. 
When using dynamic methods, then the ground acceleration caused by earth-
quakes is to be calculated according to its elapsed time without any reduction. 
If pseudo-static methods are used, then it is necessary to reduce the maximum 
acceleration PGA which is caused by earthquakes by applying the pseudo-static 
coefficient χ.  The dimension of χ is to be determined in accordance with Prof. 
Dr. Triantafyllidis’ expert report subject to recurrence intervals as well as the loca-
tion of the fracture mechanisms (near surface or deep fracture mechanisms). 
The impact of the earthquake acceleration on the pore waters in the slopes and 
the water level of the residual lake are to be taken into consideration with the help 
of the appropriate methods. 
10 
Official Verification and Approval Procedure 
The calculations submitted by the mining company are to be verified on behalf of 
the mining authority by the Geological Service North Rhine-Westphalia with the 
help of comparative calculations.  The Geological Service also investigates other 
possible fracture blocks and fracture mechanisms.  The results of the soil mechan-
ical field and laboratory investigations will also be verified for their plausibility 
and completeness.  When specific problems exist, it is also possible to consult 
additional experts.

The test report of the Geological Service includes information and recommen-
dations for the construction and monitoring of slopes.  And finally, the mining 
authority verifies the stability verification in accordance with all the requirements 
of the Federal Mining Act and grants approval. 
This procedure assures the verification and assessment of the stability by three 
different agents which is why it is also called the six eyes principle. 
11 
Constructing and Monitoring Slopes 
The company has to construct stable slopes.  Dump sites are, in particular, to be 
built in such a way that alternating strata of different materials are created which 
produces a special stability.  The construction of the slope is accompanied by sta-
bility investigations.  Surveyors have to record the slope’s structure on behalf of 
the company.  With the help of the surveying results, the mining authority can 
determine whether a slope has been built as planned. 
Deformations of the slope’s edge systems have to be monitored.  That is why 
manual measurement methods and automated measurement systems with alarms 
are used.  The proper operation of the measurement systems is monitored by the 
mining authority.  Significantly higher accelerations in the overburden deforma-
tion can be the first indication of sliding surfaces forming in the overburden and 
can signal the beginning of a disproportionate deformation.  In such a case, the 
automated measurement systems would trigger an alarm at a permanently staffed 
location.  Past practice has shown that the speed of the overburden deformations in 
the Rhenish mining district initially starts slowly and then accelerates continuous-
ly.  When there is a timely warning, then there is sufficient reaction time to initiate 
measures designed to maintain or strengthen the resistant forces in the overburden.  
This includes, for example, an immediate compensation of the inner overburden 
dump, support fillings at the slope’s toe, or an additional reduction of the ground-
water levels.  In order to reduce the primary forces in the overburden, it is possible 
to carry out relief dredging at the slope’s head or to undertake additional drainage 
measures. 
12 
Work Group Ground Mechanics to Improve the Codes of 
Practice 
In the course of advanced professional training, regular joint discussions are held 
with experts in order to exchange information about the operating conditions and 
the ascertained measurements, on the one hand, as well as new developments, on 
the other hand.  As a consequence of this exchange of expertise, the mining au-
thority has founded together with the Geological Service North Rhine-Westphalia 
and the mining company RWE Power AG a work group for ground mechanics in 
lignite mining which systematically seeks to advance the generally accepted codes 
of safety practice in this field. 

576 
R. Petri
 
 
The organization consists of a coordination group which conducts the strategic 
planning, formulates the respective professional requests, and assures the general 
framework for the technical work.  This technical work is performed by a smaller 
core work group which handles the tasks formulated by the coordination group by 
topic.  The core work group is supplemented also by the work of external experts 
if so required.

Introduction 
Today, the national law in the member states of the European Union (EU) is pri-
marily determined by higher-level decisions which are reached by the EU. When 
it comes to environmental protection, this also applies to the waste legislation 
guidelines. The fact that they are implemented differently into national law de-
monstrates the individuality of the member states. In addition to general waste 
handling provisions, the EU also specified its own guidelines for mining waste. 
National implementation follows these guidelines in the form of different legal 
standards without abandoning the uniform, standardized provisions. 
Germany’s waste legislation standards, for example, include specific regula-
tions pertaining to approval procedures, requirements for dumpsites and landfills, 
public participation, and the necessary controls exercised by public authorities. 
A set of rules, including the EU documents on the “best available technology,” 
supplements the catalog of guidelines which have to be observed. 
Essentially, any freedom in implementing these decisions is only to be found 
within the scope of the member states’ national legal structures. EU Regulations 
are directly applicable and do not require any national implementation. In contrast, 
EU Directives and Council Decisions need to be transferred into national law. 
It should be noted that the substatutory national set of rules is always relevant 
and applicable in the specific legal branch in which its authority is grounded.

EU Waste Legislation 
2.1 
Waste Framework Directive 
The EU Waste Framework Directive, which has been updated several times since 
it became effective, establishes the European framework for waste legislation in 
the individual member states: 
DIRECTIVE 2008/98/EC 
OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
of 19 November 2008 
on Waste and Repealing Certain Directives 
This Directive constitutes a legal framework for handling waste in the Euro-
pean Community. It pursues the objective of contributing towards environmental 

578 
P. Asenbaum
 
protection and human health by avoiding the harmful effects emanating from the 
generation and management of waste. 
The Directive includes definitions for such important terms as waste, recovery, 
and disposal, and it creates the basic requirements for waste management, in par-
ticular, an obligation to obtain the official approval to register any plants, facili-
ties, and/or companies undertaking waste management measures, as well as an 
obligation to establish waste management plans on part of the EU member states. 
The Directive also encompasses such major principles as, for example, an obli-
gation to handle waste in such a way that the environment and human health are 
not adversely affected, as well as a call for compliance with the waste hierarchy 
and, in line with the “polluter pays” principle, a requirement according to which 
the costs of waste disposal are to be borne by the actual waste holder, any former 
waste holders, or the manufacturers of the product from which the waste  
originates. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Waste from cafeterias (cans, etc.) 
Here are some key terms in conjunction with the aforementioned legislation: 
o 
Waste: 
Any substance or object which the holder discards, intends to discard, or is 
required to discard 
o 
Waste Management: 
The collection, transport, recycling, and disposal of waste, including the su-
pervision of such operations as well as the follow-up monitoring of disposal 
sites, and including those actions which are undertaken by dealers or brokers 
o 
Waste Prevention: 
Any measures which are undertaken before a substance, material, or product 
has become waste

o 
Recovery: 
Any operation of which the principal result is waste fulfilling a useful purpose 
o 
Recycling: 
Any recovery operation through which waste materials are reprocessed into 
products, materials, or substances either for the original, intended purpose or 
any other purpose 
2.2 
Landfill Directive 
The EU has also issued a number of additional regulations for dumpsites and land-
fills in the form of Landfill Directives which are defined more precisely by a 
Council Decision on hazardous substances. 
 
Directive 1999/31/EC of the European Council of 26 April 1999 
on the Landfill of Waste 
as well as 
COUNCIL DECISION 2003/33/EC of 19 December 2002 
Establishing Criteria and Procedures for the Acceptance of Waste at Land-
fills 
Pursuant to Article 16 of and Annex II to Directive 1999/31/EC 
 
By specifying stringent technical requirements for dumpsites, landfills, and 
waste, the European Union seeks to avoid and/or reduce as much as possible the 
harmful effects resulting from the storage of waste on the environment and, in 
particular, on the ground and surface waters, soil, air, and human health. 
A distinction is made between various categories of waste (municipal waste, 
hazardous waste and/or non-hazardous waste, inert waste). These categories apply 
to all dumpsites and landfills defined as waste disposal facilities for the storage of 
waste above and below the earth’s surface. 
According to EU law, landfills are classified into the following three  
categories: 
 
• 
Landfills for hazardous waste 
• 
Landfills for non-hazardous waste 
• 
Landfills for inert waste 
 
An approval procedure for the operation of a landfill is specified in the Direc-
tive. The member states have to ensure that existing landfills only continue their 
operation if and to the extent that they fully comply with the provisions of this 
Directive. 
The Council Decision regulates the criteria and procedures for the acceptance 
of waste in landfills pursuant to the guiding principles of Directive 1999/31/EC, 
with a particular focus on Annex II. 
 

580 
P. Asenbaum
 
Threshold values and other criteria are established for the various landfill cate-
gories. The member states have to ensure that landfills accept only such waste 
which meets the acceptance criteria for the respective landfill category. In addi-
tion, harmonized standards are determined for samplings and test procedures.

2.3 
Mining Waste Directive 
Mining waste (“waste from mineral resources”) is excluded from the application 
of the Waste Framework Directive and from the supplementary set of rules both at 
a European and a national level; mining waste is subject to a special regulation. 
The European Union has introduced measures which are designed to prevent 
and/or reduce any adverse effects on the environment as well as any resultant risks 
for humans derived from the management of waste (for example, residues and 
excavated material) in the extractive industry. 
 
Directive 2006/21/EC 
of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 15 March 2006 
on the Management of Waste from Extractive Industries 
and Amending Directive 2004/35/EC 
 
The above mentioned Directive establishes uniform European standards for the 
handling of mining waste and complements the previous set of EU rules for waste 
in a consistent and harmonized manner.

Fig. 3 Mining waste (waste rock), Westkalk corporation, Warstein 
The Mining Waste Directive provides the member states with a binding frame-
work for the management of waste resulting from the extractive industry; howev-
er, numerous aspects of this framework still need to be specified in detail and 
further developed under national law. 
The waste resulting from the extractive industry includes topsoil, overburden, 
waste rock, and residues accruing from the prospection, extraction, and processing 
of mineral resources. This waste represents the largest single waste stream in Eu-
rope, accounting for more than 20 % of the overall waste volume. 
The impact caused by the management of such waste ranges from physical ef-
fects on ecosystems (for example, sedimentation on riverbeds) to the leaching of 
acidic seepage water all the way to the discharge of heavy metals and other ha-
zardous substances which are used during ore beneficiation. The instability of 
facilities containing such waste (for example, waste heaps, tailings ponds, or 
dams) may have widespread devastating effects on humans and the environment 
for which national borders present no obstacle, as was demonstrated by the serious 
accidents that occurred in Aznalcollar, Spain, in 1998 and Baia Mare, Romania, in 
2000 (both incidents resulted in severe damages to the freshwater ecosystems and 
had extensive socioeconomic effects). 
As a new legislative instrument, the EU Directive has introduced the waste 
management plan which is to be established by the entrepreneur in order to safe-
guard and assure that the waste disposal concept is substantiated in detail and 
reported to the respective public authority already prior to the start of any mining 
activities.

2.4 
European Waste Catalog 
The European Waste Catalog serves as a tool for the description and classification 
of waste consistent with its specific monitoring requirements. Waste is classified 
according to its origin. 
 
COMMISSION DECISION of 3 May 2000 Replacing Decision 94/3/EC 
Establishing a List of Wastes Pursuant to Article 1 (a) of Council Directive 
75/442/EEC on Waste and Council Decision 94/904/EC Establishing a List of 
Hazardous Waste Pursuant to Article 1 (4) of Council Directive 91/689/EEC on 
Hazardous Waste (2000/532/EC) 
 
In the European Union, the European Waste Catalog (EWC) classifies waste 
with the help of 6-digit waste codes. The initial classification is done by allocating 
the specific branch of origin, followed by a more refined itemization of diverse 
branch-typical processes, and finally by a numerical list. In this catalog, which is 
now standardized, hazardous waste (formerly also referred to as special waste) is 
characterized by adding an asterisk (*). 
 
For example: 
 
01 
Waste Resulting from the Prospecting, Exploitation, and Extraction as 
Well as from the Physical and Chemical Treatment of Mineral Re-
sources 
 
01 01 
Waste resulting from the mining of mineral resources 
 
01 01 01 Waste resulting from the mining of metalliferous mineral resources 
01 01 02 Waste resulting from the mining of non-metalliferous mineral re-
sources

Free Access to Information on the Environment 
Access to environmental information held by public authorities is an essential 
prere-quisite for a more intense application and control of the Community’s envi-
ronmental law. 
The European Union, for example, also specifies the rules which help guarantee 
both free access to environmental information held by public authorities and the 
dissemination of this information. And the EU also determines the fundamental 
prerequisites under which access has to be provided to such information. 
 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 7 June 1990 
on the Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment 
(90/313/EEC) 
 
Information relating to the environment is considered to be any and all availa-
ble information in written, visual, aural, and/or database form on the state of wa-
ter, air, soil, fauna, flora, and natural habitats, and on any and all activities and/or 
measures adversely affecting or being capable of affecting this state, and on any 
and all activities and/or measures designed for their protection (including adminis-
trative measures and environmental protection programs). 
This Directive pursues the objective of making environmental information 
available and publicly distributing this information in a systematic manner. 
The differences in the laws of the individual member states regulating access to 
environmental information held by public authorities may result in unequal condi-
tions for the citizens of the Community when it comes to information access and 
competition.

National Waste Legislation – Germany 
3.1 
Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act 
Waste management in the Federal Republic of Germany has undergone substantial 
changes since the beginning. In Germany, the act on the disposal of waste (Waste 
Disposal Act, AbfG) issued in 1972 created the first standardized national regula-
tion of the waste law. Today, the act on promoting closed substance cycle waste 
management and ensuring environmentally compatible waste disposal (Closed 
Cycle and Waste Management Act, KrWG) forms the core provision of the perti-
nent waste legislation. 
 
Act on Promoting Closed Substance Cycle Waste Management  
and Ensuring Environmentally Compatible Waste Disposal 
(Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act – KrWG) 
of 24 February 2012 
 

584 
P. Asenbaum
 
With the KrWG, the requirements of the EU Waste Framework Directive (Di-
rective 2008/98/EC) are transferred into national law. The closed substance cycle 
management is to be aligned even stronger than before with resource, climate, and 
environmental protection.

As a follow-up regulation, the KrWG maintains the key components of the 
Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act and of the Waste Disposal Act (KrW-
/AbfG). The KrWG is supplemented and substantiated by numerous statutory 
ordinances.

Landfill Ordinance 
Since June 1, 2005, the storage of organic, biodegradable municipal waste has no 
longer been permitted without pretreatment, and since July 15, 2009, landfills 
which are not compliant with EU standards may no longer be operated – except

for such re-quisite measures as are needed to decommission such landfills. These 
are just two requirements of the Landfill Ordinance which has been available in its 
amended version since 2009. 
 
Ordinance on Landfills and Long-Term Storage Facilities 
(Landfill Ordinance – DepV) of 27 April 2009 
 
The DepV applies to landfills and long-term storage facilities of the categories 
0, I, II, III, and IV. The DepV 
 
• 
Contains requirements for the construction, operation, decommis-
sioning, and follow-up monitoring of landfills falling under the 
above mentioned categories and, in addition, also the requirements 
for their supervision and control 
• 
Regulates the treatment and storage of waste 
• 
Regulates the use of waste for the production of recycled landfill ma-
terials used in construction as well as the recovery and treatment of 
waste as recycled landfill materials used in construction on above-
ground landfills 
• 
Contains requirements for long-term storage facilities falling under 
the above mentioned categories 
 
This ordinance applies to waste holders and waste producers as well as to (also 
private) supporting organizations, owners, and/or operators of landfills and long-
term storage facilities. It also applies to operators of plants and systems for the 
production of recycled landfill materials used in construction.

Waste Recovery and Disposal Records Ordinance 
Germany’s currently applicable Ordinance on Waste Recovery and Disposal 
Records (NachwV) determines the type and extent of the requisite documentation 
and recording of hazardous and non-hazardous waste recovery and disposal in 
electronic form. 
 
Ordinance on Waste Recovery and Disposal Records 
of 20 October 2006 
 
Since April 1, 2010, it has been a mandatory legal requirement for all stake-
holders in the waste management industry to keep electronic records and, thus, 
furnish proof of any and all hazardous waste (electronic waste management sys-
tem, abbreviated: eANV). 
 
The NachwV is intended for 
 
• 
Producers and/or holders of waste (waste producers) 
• 
Collectors and/or carriers of waste (waste carriers) 
• 
Operators of facilities and/or companies which dispose waste through a 
process pursuant to Annexes II A and/or II B of the Closed Cycle and 
Waste Management Act 
 
The above mentioned ordinance does not apply to 
 
• 
Private households 
• 
The shipment of waste across state borders (this is subject to Regulation 
(EC) 1013/2006 and Germany’s Waste Shipment Act (AbfVerbrG)) 
3.4 
Waste Catalog Ordinance 
This ordinance transfers the European Waste Catalog literally unchanged into 
national law. 
 
Ordinance on the European Waste Catalog 
(Waste Catalog Ordinance – AVV) 
of 10 December 2001 
 
In line with the EU requirements, the annex to this ordinance provides a com-
plete list of all waste types with the appropriate six-digit waste codes, divided into 
chapters and groups. Those waste codes in the list which are marked with an aste-
risk (*) characterize hazardous waste types; this classification is linked to diverse 
legal consequences. Waste types not marked with an asterisk are non-hazardous 
waste.

General Federal Mining Ordinance (§ 22a) 
On May 1, 2008, the Third Ordinance on the Amendment of Mining Law Ordin-
ances dated January 24, 2008 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 85) became effective. 
This ordinance transferred the EU Directive 2006/21/EC of March 15, 2006 on the 
management of waste resulting from the extractive industry into German law; 
specifically for those facilities and plants which are subject to supervision and 
monitoring by the Mining Authorities. 
 
Mining Ordinance for All Mining Sectors 
(General Federal Mining Ordinance – ABBergV)*) 
of 23 October 1995 
§ 22a – Requirements for the Disposal of Mining Waste – 
 
In order to explain and ensure the standardized implementation of § 22a AB-
BergV, the Federal States Mining Committee (LAB) has prepared and compiled 
specific enforcement notes. These enforcement notes include seven annexes. An-
nexes 3 to 6 deal with decisions on part of the EC Commission which serve as 
supplements to the above mentioned Directive 2006/21/EC. 
 
 
Fig. 8 Tailings pond near Oradea, Romania 
All told, the residues resulting from mining operations can be assigned to one 
of the following three categories: 
 
• 
Mining waste 
• 
Waste which is subject to the Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act 
as well as the Waste Disposal Act 
• 
Materials which do not constitute any waste 
 

588 
P. Asenbaum
 
The term “mining waste” is defined in § 22a ABBergV on the basis of Euro-
pean legislation. Thus, mining waste is, without exception, 
 
• 
Dead rock (waste rock) or 
• 
Process slurries (tailings) 
 
§ 22a exclusively regulates the disposal of such mining waste. 
 
 
Fig. 9 Drilling mud from open-pit mining (lignite) 
Mining waste which is disposed outside the mining operations is to be consi-
dered as waste pursuant to the Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act and is 
subject to its provisions, which also includes the substatutory set of rules (for 
example, the Waste Recovery and Disposal Records Ordinance) as well as the 
waste laws of Germany’s federal states. This means whenever mining waste is set 
aside for its disposal outside a mining operation, this mining waste is subject to 
the general waste law. 
Mining waste which is disposed either in one’s own or in a third party’s mining 
facility pursuant to mining law is at no point in time subject to the Closed Cycle 
and Waste Management Act. Furnishing the necessary proof of its shipment be-
tween different mining facilities needs to be specified and regulated by the operat-
ing plan. 
New since May 1, 2008, are specific provisions for the disposal of mining 
waste in “waste disposal facilities” located within the mining facility, which 
means waste heaps, tailings ponds, etc. 
In addition to the operating plan for waste disposal, a waste management plan 
specifying the disposal of mining waste needs to be submitted to the Mining Au-
thority as well. 
If an operating plan for waste disposal contains the required contents of the 
waste management plan, then this operating plan can, at the same time, also serve 
as a notification of the waste management plan pursuant to § 22 Para. 2 ABBergV.

Fig. 10 Settling pond in Baia Mare, Romania 
Initially, the classification of disposal facilities according to their specific risk 
potential (for example, a Category A facility) is to be carried out by these facili-
ties. The binding classification, however, is the responsibility of the Mining Au-
thority which is to be provided with the requisite documentation, if need be. 
 
Environmental Information Act (UIG) and Freedom of Information Act (IFG) 
 
Germany’s Environmental Information Act (UIG) pursues the objective of 
providing free access to environmental information and disseminating environ-
mental information. It is directly applicable to those federal offices which are 
required by law to provide such information. The environmental information acts 
of Germany’s federal states are applicable to the offices which are required to 
provide such information in the respective federal states, and they either refer to 
the UIG or they regulate the same issue independently. 
The Freedom of Information Act (IFG) is a German law governing the free-
dom of information. So far, eleven federal states have introduced their own similar 
laws for their respective area of responsibility. 
Freedom of information is a civil right which grants the public the right to in-
spect and review documents and files kept by the public administration. Within 
this scope, for example, governmental offices and authorities may be required to 
publish their files and cases (the principle of public access to official records) 
and/or make them accessible to citizens (administrative transparency) and, to this 
end, define binding quality standards for their access. 
3.6 
Federal State Legislation 
State Waste Acts 
The Federal Government’s Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act is supple-
mented and substantiated by the individual waste acts of Germany’s federal 

590 
P. Asenbaum
 
states. Because of the Federal Government’s concurrant legislative power for 
waste management (Art. 74 Para. 1 No. 24 of the Basic Law (GG)), state law 
regulations are only possible in those sectors which are not yet covered by federal 
law. That is why the state waste acts essentially refer to enforcement questions, for 
example, the designation of corporate entities which are subject to mandatory 
waste disposal and the designation of the responsible public authorities in the 
waste sector. 
 
Waste Statutes 
The collection and processing of waste associated with households is specified at 
the municipal level in the form of waste statutes. For example, waste statutes 
include provisions on the compulsory participation and utilization. And fees for 
using the waste disposal service are also charged on the basis of municipal waste 
fee statutes. 
 
Landfill Self-Monitoring 
The construction, operation, and decommissioning of landfills and dumpsites are 
subject to monitoring on part of the respective authority which is responsible for 
such monitoring. The fundamental requirement for the supervision and monitoring 
of landfills and dumpsites accrues from the Closed Cycle and Waste Management 
Act (KrWG). Additional requirements are specified in the Landfill Ordinance. 
 
In North Rhine-Westphalia, the 
 
Regulatory Ordinance on the Self-Monitoring 
of Above Ground Landfills 
(Landfill Self-Monitoring Ordinance – DepSüVO) 
of 27 August 2010 
 
also regulates the self-monitoring of landfills. A specific focus of this ordinance is 
the submission of documents furnishing proof of this self-monitoring in form of a 
landfill annual report to be provided by the landfill operator in electronic form. 
3.7 
Sets of Rules 
The above mentioned legal standards are supplemented by numerous sets of rules 
which document, for example, the current state of technology. These sets of rules 
do not have any direct, binding legal force so that their individual implementation 
is subject to a decision made by the public authorities. 
 
Best Available Techniques Reference (BREF) 
 
At the EU level, the BREF documents need to be mentioned here first.  
BREF is the English acronym for “Best Available Techniques Reference” or “Best 

Waste Management in the Rhenish Lignite Mining District 
591
 
Available Techniques Reference Document,” abbreviated: “BAT Reference” or 
“BAT Reference Document.” In German, the term “BREF” is used in place of a 
BAT reference document. 
A BAT reference document is an EU document which describes the best avail-
able techniques (BAT) for the prevention and reduction of adverse environmental 
effects in a specific economic branch and which needs to be considered when it 
comes to the approval of facilities by public authorities within the EU. BAT con-
clusions stipulate emission values which can be obtained with the best available 
techniques. Affected facilities need to comply with these emission values no later 
than four years after the BAT conclusions have been published in the EU Official 
Journal.

Joint Waste Commission of the Federal Government and the Federal States 
(LAGA) 
LAGA is a working committee established by the German Conference of the 
Ministers of the Enviornment (UMK). Its objective is to safeguard and ensure the 
enforcement of the Federal Republic of Germany’s waste law in the most uniform 
manner at the federal state level. 
For this purpose, LAGA promotes the exchange of information and experiences 
between the Federal Government and the federal states. It maintains contacts  
to associations and interest groups. And it also develops proposals and  
provides impulses when it comes to further developing the statutory provisions 

592 
P. Asenbaum
 
and representing the interests of the federal states by defining Germany’s position 
within international committees. 
In order to solve waste management tasks, LAGA prepares reference docu-
ments, guidelines and directives as well as information material. Sample adminis-
trative regulations are compiled in order to enforce waste management legislation. 
The LAGA Ad-hoc-AG work group, for example, determines the “Uniform 
National Quality Standard” for Germany’s landfills in accordance with the Land-
fill Ordinance. 
Joint Mining Committee of the Federal Government and the Federal States 
(LAB) 
Germany’s supreme authorities at the federal and state levels whose responsi-
bility is the mining industry join forces in the Joint Mining Committee of the Fed-
eral Government and the Federal States (LAB) in order to discuss issues asso-
ciated with their fields of activities, to work out solutions, and to make recom-
mendations. 
 
This includes, in particular: 
 
• 
Providing reciprocal information and coordinating measures which re-
quire uniform administrative action on part of the Federal Government 
and the federal states; this also includes matters pertaining to the Euro-
pean Union 
• 
Guaranteeing the uniform enforcement of the Federal Mining Act 
(BBergG) in the Federal Republic of Germany 
• 
Providing reciprocal information and coordinating measures related to 
substatutory federal state law pursuant to the Federal Mining Act 
(BBergG) 
• 
Providing reciprocal information and working out proposals designed to 
enforce the mining law and any other statutory federal provisions pertain-
ing to mining in the federal states, particularly in the environmental pro-
tection and occupational safety sectors 
• 
Discussing technical questions and providing expert advice as well as 
drawing up recommendations 
 
As a standing committee appointed by the Standing Conference of the German 
Ministers for Economic Affairs, LAB reports on special events and activities. The 
Joint Mining Committee of the Federal Government and the Federal States has the 
following standing expert panels which convene as required: 
 
1. Expert Panel on Technology in the Mining Industry 
2. Expert Panel on Mining Law 
3. Expert Panel on Environmental and Mining Affairs 
 

Waste Management in the Rhenish Lignite Mining District 
593
 
As a working committee, the Expert Panel on Environmental Affairs (FAU) is a 
standing subcommittee of LAB. Its task is to inform the higher and supreme Min-
ing Authorities of the federal states about environmentally relevant issues which 
have an impact on enforcement in mining facilities. On behalf of LAB, the expert 
panel develops interstate enforcement principles for this sector. Since representa-
tives from the Joint Commissions of the Federal Government and the Federal 
States for Waste (LAGA), for Water (LAWA), and for Soil Protection (LABO) 
are also members of this expert panel, the outcomes and results of the work it 
carries out are developed in agreement with these commissions which are subor-
dinate to the Federal Ministry for the Environment. 
FAU focuses, in particular, on the disposal of mineral waste from non-mining 
and inherent mining sources in mining facilities. Since waste disposal plants are 
operated in numerous mining facilities, these facilities make a vital contribution 
towards safeguarding waste disposal in the Federal Republic of Germany. These 
facilities include above ground and underground landfills where waste is disposed 
and which are, in part, also significant for waste disposal at a European level. In 
addition, mineral waste is salvaged within the scope of rehabilitation and/or recul-
tivation measures in numerous above ground and underground facilities. The vast 
majority of the open-pit mining areas which are rehabilitated as part of their recul-
tivation are made available to agriculture, forestry, and/or nature protection. 
The North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency for Nature, Environment, and Con-
sumer Protection (LANUV NRW) 
The North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency for Nature, Environment, and Con-
sumer Protection (LANUV NRW) is a state agency which is subordinate to the 
North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agricul-
ture, Nature Conservation, and Consumer Protection (MUNLV). 
The state agency was founded in 2007 as a spin-off of diverse precursor institu-
tions and builds on their competence and their many years of experience. LANUV 
NRW is a special technical-scientific authority which is active in the fields of 
nature protection, technical environmental protection for water, soil, and air, plant 
safety, climate change issues as well as animal health and food safety within con-
sumer protection. 
 
Ministerial Decrees 
A decree is an official order handed down by an executive authority (usually 
ministries) to other state offices or to the population. In most cases, though, go-
vernmental authorities are only entitled to issue such decrees to their subordinate 
agencies, but not to citizens. 
Letters from a superior federal or state authority, regardless of their content, to 
a subordinate authority or institution are also considered to be decrees; this in-
cludes, in particular, letters from ministries to authorities within their area of re-
sponsibility. 
As a general rule, decrees unfold no third party effect; they are to be imple-
mented and enforced by the public authorities (for example, requirements for 
approvals, etc.). Hence, decrees are guidelines and instructions for law enforce-
ment authorities. 

594

3.8 
Information Systems 
Today, the legal standards and sets of rules are amended by publicly accessible 
information systems in accordance with the EU Directive on the Freedom of 
Access to Information on the Environment and/or national requirements stipulated 
by the UIG and the IFG. Access to information is primarily provided via the inter-
net. In addition, these systems are also used for supervisory purposes on part of 
the authorities and for environmental statistics. 
 
ADDISweb 
In conjunction with waste disposal sites, the 
 
Landfill Data Information System ADDIS and/or ADDISweb 
of the North Rhine-Westphalia State Agency 
for Nature, Environment, and Consumer Protection (LANUV NRW) 
 
is applied in North Rhine-Westphalia as a supporting tool for the self-monitoring 
of landfills and dumpsites and for their supervision by the authorities. 
The ADDIS landfill data information system for the self-monitoring of landfills 
and dumpsites, which had been in place since 1998, was replaced by the new web-
based information system ADDISweb in 2011. A major innovation is the direct 
access to the online data bank which is also available to the public at large. 
Operators of those North Rhine-Westphalian dumpsites and landfills which re-
quire mandatory supervision are obliged to transfer their landfill self-monitoring 
data according to an interface specification to the information system or to use the 
LANUV NRW’s available web user interface for entering their data. 
 
ASYS (Waste Monitoring System) 
In addition, hazardous waste is monitored and supervised through mass flow and 
fate verification via Germany’s national waste monitoring system ASYS. The 
system permits the processing of those data which are required for monitoring the 
proper disposal of hazardous waste. And the master data of the participating facili-
ties can be captured as well. All relevant catalogs are stored. 
As a functional option, ASYS permits the automated, electronic exchange of 
data between public authorities and participating facilities. For the electronic veri-
fication procedure, the requisite data are exchanged via the Central Waste Coordi-
nation Office (ZKS-Abfall). 
 
ENADA 
ENADA is North Rhine-Westphalia’s specialized information system for waste 
disposal sites. The system is designed to collect, forward, and evaluate the data 
provided by North Rhine-Westphalian waste disposal facilities; in particular, when it 
comes to assessing the existing plants, plant capacities, and plant technologies. And 
it also permits the identification of environmentally compatible disposal methods 
and plant-related mass flows to be applied in waste recovery and disposal. 

Waste Management in the Rhenish Lignite Mining District 
595
 
AMEDA 
AMEDA is LANUV NRW’s waste volume data bank which permits the separate 
recording and evaluation of the waste volumes provided by all LANUV NRW 
information and enforcement systems (such as ISA, ASYS, ABILA, ERIKA, and 
ADDIS) for each and every waste holder. It is, thus, possible to get an overall 
view of as well as to compare and (if need be) rectify the waste volume figures 
provided by the participating data banks; each of which only covers partial aspects 
of the waste management business. 
 
ABILA (Waste Balance for Municipal Waste) 
 
ABILA manages the data obtained from North Rhine-Westphalia’s municipal 
waste balances. The system permits the recording, management, and evaluation of 
municipal waste balance data from North Rhine-Westphalia’s 53 public waste 
management organizations, and the LANUV is obliged to report these data to the 
Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation, 
and Consumer Protection (MUNLV) once a year. 
 
ERIKA (Online Survey System for Sewage Treatment Plant Waste) 
 
ERIKA is the online survey system for waste from sewage treatment plants. 
Since early 2006, ERIKA has been replacing the previous paper-based data query 
on the volume, quality, and fate of municipal sewage sludge, sand trap materials, 
and grit chamber screenings in municipal sewage treatment plants. 
 
ISA (Information System for Substances and Plants) 
 
The computer programs of the ISA information system for substances and 
plants are available to assist the district governments, counties, and independent 
cities in North Rhine-Westphalia in their multifaceted tasks revolving around 
immission protection rights and environmental protection. 
4 
Official Licenses 
All official licensing procedures pursue the objective of safeguarding an environ-
mentally compatible disposal of waste. Depending on the specific field of law, 
different administrative procedures are applied which are, to some extent, also 
associated with environmental impact assessments and public participation. 
In addition to waste management legislation, the respective local laws are also 
applicable to certain recovery and/or recycling measures. Recovery and/or recy-
cling measures in the mining industry are approved in accordance with the appro-
priate operational planning process as specified in the mining law. Likewise, the 
mining law is also relevant for the disposal of mining waste resulting from mining 
activities. 

596 
P. Asenbaum
 
4.1 
Landfill Law 
According to the Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act, an approval proce-
dure based on the waste law is required both for the construction and operation of 
facilities for the disposal of waste (landfills) as well as for any substantial modifi-
cations made to these facilities and/or their operations (§§ 35 et sqq. of the 
KrWG). 
It has to be determined during approval procedures which are based on the 
waste law whether dumpsites and landfills can be built and operated in such a way 
that the protection of the environment, neighborhood, and general public is guar-
anteed and that the duties and obligations of the operators as stipulated by  
law are met. 
These approval procedures are carried out in accordance with the provisions of 
the Closed Cycle and Waste Management Act (KrWG), the Landfill Ordinance 
(DepV), and the Administrative Procedure Act (VwVfG). The rules and regula-
tions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (UVPG) are applicable, where 
required. The generally accepted technical regulations are also relevant. 
Because numerous other public decisions are reached simultaneously whenever 
an approval is granted in line with the KrWG, the following legal fields may, in 
addition to the waste law, also be considered specifically in the evaluation of the 
admission requirements: 
 
• 
Regional planning acts, zoning laws, building codes 
• 
Nature protection laws, landscape protection laws, forest laws 
• 
Soil protection laws, water protection laws 
• 
Immission protection laws 
• 
Hazardous substances laws 
• 
Labor protection laws 
• 
The Equipment Safety Act 
• 
The Explosives Act 
 
When it comes to approving dumpsites and landfills, the KrWG essentially dis-
tinguishes between the following two types of procedures: 
 
• 
The planning assessment procedure as the usual revision procedure and 
• 
the planning approval procedure. 
 
If existing dumpsites and landfills are to be changed and/or modified, then it is 
also possible that under certain circumstances the notification procedure may be 
used which is based on waste management legislation. 
As a basic prerequisite, the construction and operation of dumpsites and land-
fills as well as any major changes in such facilities and/or in their operations are 
subject to planning assessment, which means that a procedure needs to be fol-
lowed which also involves public participation and an environmental impact as-
sessment. 

Waste Management in the Rhenish Lignite Mining District 
597
 
Instead of an official planning permission, a planning approval can also be 
granted if the scheduled preliminary examination proves that the planned project 
will not result in any substantial adverse effects on one of the above mentioned 
objects of protection. 
Every planning assessment procedure which is based on the waste law requires 
an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the Environmental Impact 
Assessment Act. This does not apply to planning approval procedures. 
An environmental impact assessment includes as a legally dependent part of the 
planning assessment procedure the identification, description, and rating of a 
dumpsite’s or landfill’s impact on the environment; and it is to be conducted with 
public participation. The requisite tests encompass the effects of the planned 
project including its operation and its on-site inventory after decommissioning 
(life cycle considerations) on humans, animals, plants, soil, water, air, climate, 
landscape, cultural assets, and other material assets as well as the respective inte-
ractions. 
4.2 
Mining Law 
In mining, the operational planning process pursuant to §§ 51 et sqq. of the Feder-
al Mining Act (BBergG) is a common and appropriate procedure when it comes to 
obtaining official licenses and approvals for activities to be carried out in conjunc-
tion with operational waste. This process is a binding administrative act, which 
means that as soon as the admission requirements are met in accordance with § 55 
of the BBergG, the respective governmental authority must grant the approval. 
Otherwise, the authority has to ensure by virtue of incidental provisions that the 
respective admission requirements will be met. 
The operational planning process as stipulated by mining law is to be applied to 
recycling waste, even to such recycling waste which is tendered to the mining 
facility by third parties and which is to be recovered in the mine. The responsible 
Mining Authority has to specify the requisite requirements for environmental 
protection and, if need be, also demand the provision of security measures. 
This could be, for example, mineral construction waste which helps build im-
mission protection dams as a preparatory clearance measure for the subsequent 
operation of open-pit mines, or supporting dams which are built during the actual 
open-pit mining operations. And this also includes the recycling of compost for 
immission protection purposes at the bottoms and on the slopes of open-pit mines. 
The EU Mining Waste Directive was implemented at a national level by incor-
porating the new § 22a with its Annexes 5 to 7 into the Mining Ordinance for all 
mining facilities (General Federal Mining Ordinance – ABBergV) of October 23, 
1995. 
As a new legislative instrument, the EU Directive has introduced the waste 
management plan which is to be established by the entrepreneur in order to safe-
guard and assure that the waste disposal concept is substantiated in detail and 
reported to the respective public authority already prior to the start of any mining 
activities. 

598 
P. Asenbaum
 
The requirements for waste management plans are defined in § 22a Para. 2 as 
well as in Annex 5 “Waste Management Plan” with reference to Annexes II and 
III of Directive 2006/21/EC. Additional requirements for the construction, opera-
tion, and decommissioning of waste disposal facilities for mining waste can be 
found in Annex 5 to § 22a Para. 3. Annex 6 contains additional requirements for 
the provision of security measures pursuant to § 56 Para. 2 of the Federal Mining 
Act for Category A waste disposal facilities. 
Such a waste management plan must encompass the entire life cycle of the re-
spective mine. Waste management plans pursue the objective of avoiding or re-
ducing waste (specifically mining waste) and any harm emanating from such 
waste. The waste management plan is to be continuously updated and submitted to 
the responsible governmental authority on a regular basis. 
Mining waste accrues either as waste rock or as sludge containing mill tailings 
and process slurries. If waste disposal facilities (waste heaps, slurry ponds, etc.) 
need to be built and operated for these wastes, then this requires in addition to a 
waste management plan also an official license for the respective waste disposal 
facility pursuant to § 22a of the General Federal Mining Ordinance (ABBergV). 
In accordance with § 22a Para. 1 ABBergV, and irrespective of the provisions 
governing the obligation to establish and maintain an operating plan, entrepre-
neurs need to undertake appropriate measures for the disposal of mining waste 
when it comes to the construction, management, and shutdown of their plant so as 
to avoid or reduce as far as possible the environmental impact as well as the resul-
tant risks for human health. In so doing, entrepreneurs need to consider the current 
state of technology with regard to the specific characteristics of their waste dis-
posal plant, its location, and the environmental conditions on site. That is why the 
use of a specific technology is not mandatory. In this context, reference is also 
made to the EU BREF documents – or more precisely: The BREF document 
“Management of Tailings and Waste Rock in Mining Activities.” 
For waste disposal facilities, § 22a Para. 3 ABBergV specifies the compulsory 
application of the operational planning process as stipulated by mining law; de-
pending on the specific risk potential, this might also include public participation. 
In the Rhenish lignite mining district, the legal requirements of § 22a ABBergV 
are met by a special operating plan illustrating waste management in a compre-
hensive manner. This special operating plan represents all waste management 
activities in accordance with the waste and the mining laws and is continuously 
updated every year. 
This special operating plan relieves the compulsory main operating plan for 
open-pit mines. The latter has, in addition to a general overview of waste man-
agement and the dumpsites and landfills in operation, only a reference to this 
special document.

Waste in the Mining Industry: Examples 
5.1 
Common Waste 
Waste resulting from mining operations encompasses both that group of waste 
which accrues indirectly during the prospecting, extraction, and processing as well 
as during the associated storage of mineral resources in mining facilities (common 
waste) and mining waste as stipulated by the exemption clause of § 2 Para. 2 No. 7 
KrWG. 
Common waste is to be categorized into the following types according to its 
origin: 
 
• 
Household waste and the like

Fig. 12 Mineral construction waste (building rubble) 
Household waste and the like is waste coming from, for example, recreation 
rooms and cafeterias which usually also accrues elsewhere in comparable volumes 
and qualities. Recreation rooms and cafeterias are, by the way, not specific to the 
mining industry. 
Machinery and vehicles are maintained and serviced in numerous workshops of 
the mining industry which also include maintenance and repair shops. Waste ac-
cruing from these activities includes, for example, oily cleaning rags and machine 
parts as well as used fuels and lubricants. That is why much of the waste has to be 
identified with hazard symbols and disposed separately. This waste group also 
exhibits no special characteristics which would be unique to mining. 
Large quantities of excavated soil and building rubble in different qualities ac-
cumulate, for example, within the scope of preparatory clearance measures, which

also include the relocation of entire villages, for the subsequent operation of open-
pit mines. Comparable waste is also created in the course of large-scale projects in 
urban areas which is why they do not justify any exemption pursuant to § 2 Para. 2 
No. 7 KrWG (which means they are not mining waste). 
The provisions of the waste law are to be applied in full to the wastes men-
tioned above, in particular, if and to the extent that their due and proper disposal is 
not part of the actual mining operations. Exemptions only apply to specific recov-
ery purposes applied in mining, for example, the recovery of mineral fractions for 
road construction. 
5.2 
Mining Waste 
As defined by the EU, only dead rock (waste rock) and process slurries (tailings) are 
to be subsumed under the term mining waste. Generally, dangers and risks emanate 
from inadequately secured heaps and ponds as well as hazardous ingredients. 
In the Rhenish lignite mining district, mining waste only accrues in the form of 
drilling mud within the scope of drainage measures carried out prior to the actual 
mining operations. The drilling mud is dumped together with the overburden, but 
in smaller quantities. The actual overburden is used for backfilling the open-pit 
mining holes. Following this definition, overburden is, thus, neither mining waste 
nor waste. 
 
Fig. 13 Tailing pond in Baia-Mare, Romania 
All other waste is subject to the provisions of the general waste law (KrWG) 
and is to be disposed accordingly. 
5.3 
Waste Recovery 
According to the nomenclature of the waste law, the avoidance and recovery of 
waste takes precedence over its removal. 

Waste Management in the Rhenish Lignite Mining District 
601
 
Recovery pursuant to the KrWG refers to any process within the plant or in the 
economy at large wherein the principal result is waste serving a useful purpose by 
replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfill a partic-
ular function, or waste being prepared in such a way that it fulfills that function. 
Thus, the legal possibility and/or requirement have been created for using suit-
able waste prior to landfilling within the scope of recovery measures. That is why 
it does not matter whether it is one’s own waste or the waste of third parties. 
When it comes to official approvals for recovery measures, the respective local 
law is to be applied. In the mining industry, this includes in particular the use of 
soils for the reduction of extraction-related mass deficits or the use of soils in 
recultivation measures. But mineral construction waste is also suitable, for exam-
ple, for road construction or the construction of supporting and immission protec-
tion dams. For immission protection purposes, suitable composts can be spread 
over the bottom of open-pit mines and on their slopes. The creation of green areas, 
thus, reinforces the desired purpose. 
In industrial power plants of upgrading facilities, substitute fuels, sewage 
sludges, and other suitable wastes can be recovered and recycled within the scope 
of coincineration processes in accordance with the provisions of the 17th Federal 
Immission Control Ordinance (BImSchV). 
The provisions of the Commercial Waste Ordinance (GewAbfV) also assign 
certain mandatory recovery quotas for common waste to mining facilities. Within 
the scope of a full service contract, the RWE Power AG corporation, for example, 
employs a certified waste management company (Entsorgungsgesellschaft Nie-
derrhein, EGN) which separates the waste collected from mining facilities accord-
ing to recovery and disposal in its waste treatment plants and which furnishes 
proof that the quotas required by the Commercial Waste Ordinance are met. 
 
 
Fig. 14 Collection systems for commercial waste (EGN) 
In addition, mining operators are also required to either observe any obligations 
that may exist regarding the tendering of waste to corporate entities which are 
subject to mandatory waste management pursuant to § 17 KrWG or, alternatively, 
to apply for an exemption.

5.4 
Waste Disposal 
Provided that waste cannot be recovered and/or recycled, it has to be disposed 
properly. Disposal means landfilling. Properly means in accordance with the exist-
ing rules and regulations and in such a way that the interests of the general public 
are neither violated nor infringed upon. 
 
 
Fig. 15 “Vereinigte Ville” landfill for power plant residues 
In this context, for example, power plant residues and/or ashes generated by 
lignite are to be mentioned which accrue in large quantities and consistent quali-
ties at power plants located near mines and at customer facilities. For the disposal 
of these wastes, the RWE Power AG corporation, for example, operates a number 
of dumpsites and landfills in the Rhenish lignite mining district in accordance with 
the provisions of the Landfill Ordinance and, thus, in line with European stan-
dards. Currently, landfills for power plant residues are operated at the following 
locations: 
 
• 
Garzweiler 
• 
Fortuna 
• 
Inden 
• 
Vereinigte Ville 
 
For the disposal of non-recyclable mineral construction wastes resulting from 
preparatory clearance measures prior to the actual mining operations, some land-
fills for power plant residues have established mono sections above the prospec-
tive groundwater level. This permitted the shutdown of “mine dumps” which had 
been operated in open-pit mines until then.

5.5 
Qualification 
§ 59 of the KrWG stipulates that operators of facilities and plants in which ha-
zardous wastes accrue periodically, as well as operators of stationary recycling 
and/or waste disposal facilities and plants, are required to immediately appoint one 
or several official representatives for waste (waste management officers); pro-
vided that this proves to be necessary with regard to the type and/or size of these 
facilities and plants. 
Waste management officers are trained and educated employees who are ap-
pointed in writing and act as advisors to the plant management. In addition, waste 
management officers exercise a control function and submit reports to the corpo-
rate management once a year. 
According to this requirement, the RWE Power AG corporation trains and edu-
cates centrally and decentrally established waste management officers and notifies 
the Mining Authority of these appointees. Independent certifications as a special 
waste management facility supplement the qualification, for example, when  
it comes to the coincineration of waste in industrial power plants of upgrading 
facilities. 
The full-service waste management provider, the Entsorgungsgesellschaft Nie-
derrhein (EGN) corporation, also warrants and assures its qualification with the 
appropriate professional certification. 
6 
Official Supervision 
The official waste management supervision in the lignite mining facilities of the 
Rhenish district is carried out centrally for the entire district by North Rhine-
Westphalia’s Mining Authority; specifically by Department 6 of the District  
Government Arnsberg at its Düren office. The experts in this office approve and 
supervise the waste streams close to the respective locations and in a very  
effective manner. For example, two waste controllers are available to the public 
authority for on-site samplings and additional specialists for operating the  
pertinent electronic waste management systems. 
7 
Conclusion 
Waste management in mining facilities needs to be differentiated. In addition to 
mining waste, common waste is also generated there which has to be disposed in 
accordance with the rules and regulations of the general waste law. Waste man-
agement includes both recovery, which has priority, and disposal, which assumes 
a subordinate role. 
The European Union has published binding requirements for both waste  
management methods. The Waste Framework Directive and the Mining Waste 
Directive have to be seen as the central rules here. This framework is further  

604 
P. Asenbaum
 
specified by national standards and supplemented by sets of rules which reflect, 
for example, the state of technology. 
For such typical mining wastes as waste rock and process slurries or tailings, a 
specific approval instrument has been created in accordance with the provisions of 
§ 22a of the General Federal Mining Ordinance (ABBergV). 
Generally, administrative procedures associated with approvals are to be con-
ducted with public participation and by taking into consideration the requirements 
for environmental protection as well as the life cycle of mines. 
A special operating plan for individual mines (“presentation of the waste man-
agement”) has proven to be successful in the Rhenish lignite mining district which 
documents both the common waste and the mining waste. It is, thus, at the same 
time also a “waste management plan” in accordance with European legislative 
requirements. 
Depending on their suitability, internal and external wastes are recovered and 
recycled in open-pit mines and industrial power plants of upgrading facilities 
pursuant to the respective local law and/or the Federal Immission Control Ordin-
ance (BImSchG). Residues resulting from lignite combustion in power plants are 
removed and disposed on specific landfills for power plant residues. And non-
recyclable mineral fractions generated during clearance operations prior to the 
actual mining activities are also removed and disposed here in accordance with the 
provisions of the Landfill Ordinance. 
RWE Power AG’s centralized waste management guarantees the proper  
handling of waste under the supervision of North Rhine-Westphalia’s Mining 
Authority.

Abstract. The Energy Company Vattenfall operates opencast lignite mines in 
Brandenburg. One of the approved opencast mine projects included the Lakoma 
pond area ("Lakomaer Teiche”) which was registered as FFH area and claimed by 
the opencast mine. The European Commission was involved in the approval pro-
cedure. The approval for claiming the FFH area was granted under the imposition 
of the obligation of comprehensive compensation measures with regard to nature 
conservation. In accordance with the FFH directive the compensation measures 
had to be effective already at the time of the intervention. The approval of the plan 
according to water law was the first approval ever granted to completely remove a 
FFH area in Germany.

Introduction 
In Germany, not far away from Cottbus in the Land of Brandenburg the Cottbus-
Nord opencast mine is operated by Vattenfall Europe Mining AG. Since 1981, 
lignite has been mined in the opencast mine to supply the Jänschwalde power 
plant. The Lakoma pond area was within the approved mining field of this open-
cast mine. It consisted of 22 ponds with a total area of 69 ha. The ponds were use 
to breed carps. As a consequence of the pond farming practised for many centuries 
a high diversity of habitats and species developed around the waters. In the area 
totally 1320 species and 68 protected biotopes were identified.

In May 1998 the mining company announced the project for abandoning the 
Lakoma pond area with the respective authority, the State Office for Mining, Ge-
ology and Raw Materials (LBGR). In 2002, the zoning application was submitted. 
As a result of the previously held discussions the creation of a new pond area was 
intended. This concept was refused by the Brandenburg State Environmental Of-
fice (LUA). The LUA alternatively proposed the renaturation of the Spreeaue 
(Spree floodplain) north of Cottbus as a complex compensation measure. 
In January 2004 the revised planning documents were submitted. The Land of 
Brandenburg, however, proposed the Lakoma pond area as FFH area in December 
2003 and in March 2004 the Federal Republic of Germany submitted the proposal 
to the European Commission. In the Flora-Fauna-Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) 
the member countries of the EU have not only committed to establish protected 
areas for certain threatened habitats and species - the so-called FFH or Natura 
2000 areas - but also to implement comprehensive compensation measures in the 
case of impacts in these areas to preserve coherence of the Natura 2000 network. 
End of 2004 it was necessary to involve also the European Commission in Brus-
sels in the approval procedure and to obtain a position statement according to 
Article 6 Para. 4 because there was a suspicion that the priority specie hermit 
beetle (Osmoderma eremita) has settled in the trees (FREYTAG et al., 2007).  
 
 
Fig. 1 Cottbus-Nord opencast mine  
Resulting from the changed legal basic situation the compensation concept had 
to be revised several times. To preserve the coherence of FFH relevant habitats 
and species, species-specific compensation measures had to be planned in further

compensation zones. In November 2006 the European Commission gave a written 
statement that the revised compensation concept maintains the overall coherence 
of the Natura 2000 network. In December 2006 the LBGR made the decision on 
the official approval of the plan. The abandonment of the Lakoma pond area was 
the first example for approving the complete removal of a FFH area in Germany 
(WIEDEMANN et al., 2008). Due to the explosiveness of this subject the whole 
planning approval procedure was accompanied by objections and legal disputes 
with nature conservation organisations. 
2 
Concept for Maintaining the Coherence of Natura 2000 
Type and scope of the compensation measures mainly depend on the existing of 
relevant FFH species and habitats in the impact area. According to the FFH Direc-
tive the compensation measures shall be effective at the time when the damage 
occurs in the impact area unless it can be proven that simultaneity is not necessari-
ly required (EC 2000). For claiming the Lakoma pond area it was therefore neces-
sary to start implementation of the compensation measures as early as possible. 
When exactly the impact will cause interference will mainly depend on the 
concerned FFH specie or habitat. An impact can cause an immediate or a delayed 
interference. If the Lakoma ponds would have been drained for example in sum-
mer the impact for amphibians had been effective immediately. Therefore the 
ponds were only drained after the animals have retreated into the places where 
they spend the winter season. For this reason the impact effect of drainage only 
started in the following spring time. When implementing the compensation meas-
ures it is also necessary to differentiate between the time of completion and active 
effectiveness. They can become effective immediately or with a delay in time 
(GERSTGRASER, 2009).  
A timetable was established for all habitats and species concerned which 
showed the beginning of the impact and the time when the compensation measure 
should become effective. However, delays in time during the approval procedure 
in connection with the continuation of the opencast mine resulted in ever shorter 
time for implementing the compensation measures. It was therefore necessary to 
adjust both the technological realization and sequencing of the compensation 
concept several times. 
3 
Implementation of Compensation Measures 
An area of 130 ha of the core zone of the FFH area Lakoma was claimed by drain-
ing the Lakoma ponds. Extensive investigations were carried out in the neigh-
bourhood of the impact area to select suitable compensation zones. Altogether, the 
compensation measures were implemented in seven different zones with a total 
area of more than 530 ha (GERSTGRASER et al., 2008).

Fig. 2 Impact and compensation areas  
The compensation measures were carried out within the period from 2007 to 
2013 and included a number of single and complex measures with different func-
tions and scopes. From the various compensation measures some single measures 
are shortly illustrated hereinafter. 
3.1 
Renaturation of the Spreeaue and the Spreeaue Ponds 
The Spree River is the most important river in Lusatia. Over centuries the Spree 
and its floodplains were extensively changed by human activity. The Spree is 
diked on both sides and within the compensation area it was a monotonous river 
with lack of structural diversity. Missing discharge dynamics by storage dams in 
the upper reaches and missing longitudinal connectivity resulted in a reduction of 
variety of species. Over long distances the Spree was not cross-linked with the envi-
rons, wetlands were drained, riverine and floodplain forests were almost missing. 
North of Cottbus, the Spree was restored to its near-natural state by comprehen-
sive renaturation measures on a length of 11 km and within an area of 400 ha. The 
following measures were realized: 
 
• Establishment of longitudinal connectivity by removal or redesigning of 
the ground ramps into river bottom slides 
• Structural improvements with groins, islands and side channels 
• Connecting of meanders, section wise diversion of the Spree and creation 
of new side streams 
• Relocation of dikes on a length of 3 km for providing new flooding areas 
• Improvement of variation in width by flattening of banks above mean wa-
ter level 
• Initializing of riverine and floodplain forests  

Approval Procedure and Compensation Measures 
609
 
• Improvement of connectivity of Spree and dike hinterland by installing a 
new river course on a length of 6 km 
• Improvement of the water regime of the region by disconnecting existing 
drainage systems 
• Conversion of forest and establishment of new marshland forests in the 
dike hinterland 
• Creation of habitats for amphibians, otters and other species in the dike 
hinterland

Another measure was the creation of the Spreeaue ponds. The ponds especially 
serve the securing of the Natura 2000 network for otter, fire-bellied toad and FFH 
habitats. The pond group consists of eight ponds with a water surface of 21 ha. 
They have wide shallow water zones and islands. Water is supplied from the Spree 
and is regulated by inflow and outflow structures.  
Comprehensive landscaping measures were conducted for structuring the pond 
area and upgrading the environment. For a fast development of a pond vegetation 
reed rhizomes and pond ground from the impact area were settled in the ponds. 
Along the ponds trees, shrub groups and in the surrounding area marshland forests 
and reed were established.  
The competent implementation in combination with a focused maintenance and 
cultivation of the ponds resulted in the establishment of an impressive countryside 
in the Spreeaue in a very short time. Therefore the renaturation of the Spreeaue is 
an important element for securing the Natura 2000 network. In addition, numerous

installation  
other animal and plant species benefit from the renaturation of the Spreeaue. Eco-
logical networking in the region is supported and a place providing a quiet and 
peaceful recreation for the local residents is created. 
3.2 
Resettlement of Amphibians 
All amphibians existing in the impact area had to be resettled because there have 
not been available any suitable alternative habitats in the environment. During 
summer 2007 and 2008, amphibian larvae were collected in the Lakoma ponds. 
All animals were determined, counted and released in suitable new ponds in the 
Spreeaue.  
The resettlement of old and young animals started in September 2007. Until June 
2010, amphibians were resettled both in spring and autumn over a period of several 
weeks. For the collection of the animals 22 km of rescue fences for amphibians were 
installed in the Lakoma pond area. Altogether more than 180,000 larvae and  
animals, of it 76,220 fire-bellied toads, were resettled (gIR, 2012). About 150,000 
amphibians were resettled in the ponds of the Spreeaue and more than 30,000  
amphibian larvae were handed over to the Landesumweltamt Brandenburg  
(Environmental Authority of Brandenburg) for resettlement at other places.  
 

Approval Procedure and Compensation Measures 
611
 
For the resettlement of the old and young animals in the Spreeaue selected 
ponds with surrounding wet and forest areas were fenced. This measure prevented 
migration of the animals out of the pond area for the first two years. In the mean-
time all fences have been removed and the animals can move freely in the re-
established waterlogged Spreeaue. 
 
Fig. 5 Resettlement of amphibians 
3.3 
Creation of a Migration Corridor for the Otter 
A 5 km long safe migration corridor for the otter was built between the Spreeaue 
and the Peitzer Teiche - as one of several compensation measures. Therefore, new 
ditches were built with river bank wood and 16 otter passages were built new or 
reconstructed at dangerous crossing points. Hence, the risk to otters at roads and 
trails was lowered and more distant natural areas were safely made accessible for 
the otter. 
The Monitoring showed that the migration corridor and all other passage struc-
tures were accepted by the otter (ALKA-KRANZ, 2012). It was noted that the 
intensity of the use of the passages is quite different. Occasionally, the passages 
were used frequently and thereafter not used for a longer period of time. Nearby 
the ponds the migration behaviour also changed with the seasonally and spatially 
changing fish stock.

3.4 
Relocation of the Hermit Beetle Trees into the Grosse Zossna 
The hermit beetle, as a priority FFH specie, is a beetle who settles in hollow 
trunks of old tree stands. In the impact area there were 5 of such trees with the 
suspicion that they were settled by hermit beetles. These 5 trees were endangered 
by the drainage of the Lakoma pond group. However, since the hermit beetle can 
complete the development from larval stage to beetle in deadwood the drainage of 
the water was not a direct impairment. But the massive abstraction of water supply 
results in the accelerated shrinking of the habitat of the beetle on a large area. 
The suspected trees were carefully cut in winter after the imagos decease and 
brought to a nearby 2 hectare large area with mature stands of hornbeam trees and 
English oaks. The trunk parts were placed in form of tree pyramids at the new 
location. The larvae shall develop in the trunk parts. During the monitoring it was 
observed that one beetle flew from one of the relocated trees (BIOM, 2010).  
The development of potential habitats for the hermit beetle within the forest 
stands in the renaturation area of the Spreeaue will be a further measure for the 
long-term. For this reason non-native forest stands were transformed into deci-
duous forest stands of different age in a nature oriented way. This way new  
habitats for the hermit beetle will be created in the long run.

Control of Success 
Since 2007 the effects of the compensation measures have been controlled by a 
complex monitoring program involving various experts. Monitoring comprises 
investigations of flora and fauna as well as abiotic factors. Up to 16 different 
comprehensive reports per year are submitted to the authorities. Control of success 
is carried out over a period of 5 years. If the compensation targets will not be 
achieved during the monitoring period the LBGR can determine additional meas-
ures at any time.  
The monitoring differs with regard to content, locations and times. A focused 
project management ensures that the single surveys are coordinated. All results of 
the experts are managed in digital form and entered in a GIS data base.  
As a result of the monitoring executed so far it can be concluded that all com-
pensation targets have been achieved and the Natura 2000 network was main-
tained (GERSTGRASER/ZANK, 2012) Altogether, unique conclusions about 
effects and development of the compensation measures can be drawn from the 
available monitoring data.

Conclusion 
For the removal of the FFH area "Lakomaer Teiche" with approximately 130 ha of 
significant habitats, comprehensive compensation measures have been imple-
mented in seven different zones covering totally 530 ha.  The example of the 
claiming of the FFH area Lakomaer Teiche by the Cottbus-Nord opencast mine 
shows that despite unavoidable interferences with nature and landscape mining 
also offers chances for preserving and upgrading species, habitats and landscapes.  
Early and comprehensive knowledge about the concerns of the habitats and 
species in the impact area are important for securing the FFH-relevant protection 
targets. Because the ecosystem is subject to natural annual fluctuations, sufficient-
ly large and interconnected compensation spaces must be available for such sensi-
ble compensation measures to be able to balance natural fluctuations.  
Professional implementation along with the monitoring of success of the meas-
ures essentially contributed to the success of the compensation measures. This 
ensures that in case of need improvement can be provided in short-term.

Build-Up and Support for Regional Initiatives 
around Opencast Mines  
Michael Eyll-Vetter and Jens Voigt 
RWE Power, Köln, Germany 
Abstract. The relations between Germany's lignite industry and other regional 
actors is an important gauge for the regional anchoring of this branch of Ger-
many's energy industry. Partnership at eye level is vital to these relations and has 
given rise to new forms of cooperation. This becomes especially apparent when it 
comes to shaping regional structures and further strengthening of the region's 
economic structure.  
The Indeland and Terra Nova projects are good examples of the efforts to re-
shape regional structures in the post-mining phase. Within the scope of the Inde-
land project, Düren county and several towns and municipalities in the vicinity of 
the Inden opencast mine came together to take action. In the years that followed, 
the non-profit Aachen-based Kathy Beys foundation lent its support to the process 
with the aim of redeveloping the structure of the post-mine landscape and the rural 
area around the opencast mine.  
The Terra Nova project network in the area of the Hambach and Fortuna open-
cast mines likewise consists of several modules and has worked out an overall 
regional concept with the support of RWE, and this concept is being implemented. 
In a next step, the neighbouring communities around the Hambach and Garzweiler 
opencast mines are to be included in the further development within the initiatives 
in the mines' vicinity. On account of the much longer mine operating times, the 
focus in Hambach and Garzweiler is also on the gradual implementation of meas-
ures for upgrading the townships on the mines' rim, this in addition to the planning 
of recultivation. Inter-municipal structural projects are also to be developed. 
The Rhenish mining area has for many years now had an efficient and broad-
base economic structure. Its further strengthening is a joint task for regional actors 
and the lignite industry. The region's economic clout is to be strengthened and 
diversified along these lines by providing further economic mainstays besides 
lignite. The lignite industry and regional entities have traditionally driven forward 
the development of industrial estates and a corresponding settlement policy on a 
joint basis. The focus here is above all on medium-sized business: 3,500 new jobs 
have been created by investment in the last ten years based on industrial estates at 
various locations in the mining area, which have either been implemented or are in 
the pipeline.  
In the agricultural region, the food sector, too, plays an important part. RWE 
Power has been successfully working for some time now on the utilisation of the 
energy content of waste heat from the cooling-tower and sump water for agricul-
tural production. A partnership-based approach underlies the cooperation between

lignite companies and municipalities in the development of projects and also in the 
distribution of opportunities and risks.

Introduction  
The regional structure in the Rhenish lignite-mining area bears the stamp of the 
lignite industry. At the same time, however, the region has also left its stamp on 
the mining and use of lignite. Shaping this interaction is key to the region's devel-
opment (see Fig. 1: Paffendorf township and Fortuna opencast mine).

The extraction and use of Germany's valuable domestic lignite deposits – with 
approved reserves of 3 billion tons – is meaningful and necessary, and will be so 
for many decades to come. Lignite makes a contribution to a secure energy supply 
and, together with renewable resources, helps offset the phase-out of nuclear en-
ergy. Moreover, it does not drive up the price of electricity and, in the recent past, 
has gone far to enable the German economy with its intact industry to more than 
hold its own in times of crisis. This being so, it is an asset for the industrial State 
of North Rhine-Westphalia that must not be underestimated.

The term 'emancipation process' describes well the cooperation between lignite 
and region that has evolved across the past decades. Back in the 1980s, the lignite 
industry was financially strong and left its imprint on structures. The participation 
of regional bodies and individual citizens in decisions on investment and jobs was 
limited. Now, however, the rationalisation of the past decades with the necessary 
cutting of jobs has also led to losses in the structural rooting of lignite in the re-
gion. The region has logically diversified into a more varied and balanced eco-
nomic and social system in the recent past. RWE today is one of many actors in 
the region and draws up concepts for future regional development together with a 
much more extensive circle of players. Today's forms of joint action have consid-
erable implications for methods when it comes to tackling the issues involved in 
lignite extraction and utilisation.

Shaping the Regional Structures  
Besides recultivation in the classic sense, re-shaping the landscape after the inter-
vention of mining today takes account of a whole host of ecological, commercial 
and leisure aspects, and also of issues relating to the social and technical infra-
structure. One prime example of this is the Indeland project to the west of the 
Rhenish lignite-mining area.  
2.1 
The Indeland Project  
The question of shaping the follow-up structures for the Inden opencast mine, where 
operations will taper out toward 2030 was addressed early on. To this end, the start 
of the last decade saw the formation, with broad social support, of the Indeland 
initiative in the west of the Rhenish lignite-mining area in order to seize the oppor-
tunities offered for restructuring the entire, more agricultural space in the environs of 
the opencast mine. For this, it specially created an organisational framework in the 
guise of the "Indeland Entwicklungsgesellschaft" development company. 
Members include Düren county, the towns of Eschweiler, Jülich and Linnich as 
well as the Aldenhoven, Inden, Langerwehe and Niederzier municipalities, plus 
RWE Power in an advisory capacity. With the private Aachen-based Kathy Beys 
foundation, it was also possible to win over a knowledgeable and neutral authority 
as moderator and driver behind the process.  
Trigger for the new activities was above all the amendment to the lignite plan 
Inden II encouraged by important local-government actors. The bottom line is the 
creation of an 11-km² lake instead of the originally envisaged backfilling of the 
opencast mine using overburden, thus enabling new utilisation concepts. In pro-
ducing these concepts, use was made of experience gained with the successful 
remediation of shut-down opencast lignite mines in Central and East Germany and 
with the rapid development of the water-related leisure and tourism industry in the 
area of the Dutch Maas river. In parallel, one focus in equal measure was on the 
further development of the economic structure.

Fig. 2 "Inde man" 
The 36-meter viewing platform "Inde man" is the project landmark in this con-
certed effort (see Fig. 2: "Inde man"). For the vicinity of the opencast mine, "Inde-
land Entwicklungsgesellschaft" – with the support of RWE – is developing a  
regional master plan which defines joint planning and development goals for the 
municipalities involved, focusing mainly on projects in residential- and industrial-
estate development, traffic infrastructure, renewable energy sources, leisure and 
tourism. The process of changing the rehabilitation of the Inden opencast mine has 
thus evolved into a new form of inter-municipal and social cooperation.  
2.2 
The Terra Nova Project  
The towns of Bedburg, Bergheim, Elsdorf and Rhein-Erft county have together set 
up the joint Terra Nova planning network to shape and further develop the land-
scape produced by opencast lignite mining. The former long-distance conveyor-
belt route, the northern edge of the Hambach opencast mine, the industrial estate 
and the power plant form the four modules at the core of Terra Nova. They pro-
vide impetus for shaping the landscape, while at the same time creating long-term 
visibility of lignite mining and use for the visitor. With the former overburden 
conveyor belt, as main axis measuring some 12 km, Terra Nova today links the 
towns of Bergheim, Bedburg and Elsdorf.

outings by strollers, cyclists and skaters. (see Fig. 3: speedway Terra Nova). Fol-

band" is the opencast-mine rim, which is being designed as a landscape garden, 
itself a piece of "terra nova". Part of the 'opencast mine rim' module is the Forum 
Terra Nova (see Fig. 4: Forum Terra Nova). As information and exhibition venue, 
its remit is to provide visitors with glimpses of ongoing opencast mining opera-
tions and, in a few years' time, recultivation progress. This building is outstanding, 
both visually and functionally, and is located right on the mine rim. It is equipped 
with future-geared technology, eg a heating system using sump water.  
The Niederaussem power plant, another Terra Nova module, forms part of the 
learning landscape for energy management and, with the information centre, offers 
an opportunity to experience modern power-plant engineering and have a look at 
the new BoAplus power-station project with its manifold innovations round and 
about coal.  
As fourth Terra Nova module, an inter-municipal industrial estate is to be de-
veloped. The aim is the settlement of scientific facilities, combined with industrial 
operations, stressing the innovative use of resources. Hence, the overall Terra 
Nova complex, like the Indeland project, is developing its special importance for 
the region due to the variety of the subjects included and the networking of many 
project partners to achieve joint goals.  
2.3 
The Hambach and Garzweiler Neighbourhood Initiatives   
The future development of the Hambach opencast mine and its recultivation af-
fects neighbouring townships to a high degree. Those concerned are six towns. 
They – together with the opencast-mine operator and the administrative districts in 
charge – wish to form the core of a planning community or community of interests 
for the Hambach post-mine landscape. Owing to the long term of the Hambach 
opencast mining operations, the various focuses and the urgency of the concrete 
arrangements for rehabilitation vary substantially. All the same – also as backing 
for the further development of the Hambach mine in the coming years – such a 
neighbourhood initiative is set to accompany the cooperation between mining 
operations and neighbouring municipalities on a regular basis.  
Since the mining area is crossed by the boundaries of the two counties of Düren 
and Rhein-Erft, these two county councils in particular play an important role in 
coordinating the planning, in the moderation of possible conflicts and as provider 
of ideas and engine for future developments. Moreover, they input experience 
from other projects implemented across the township borders. After all, they must 
be crucially involved in the approval procedures, eg via the Lower Nature-
Conservation Authorities.  
The Cologne regional government as intermediate authority of the State of 
NRW in this process will mainly play a role as approval authority, inter alia, be-
cause it must examine the compatibility of the above planning with the stipula-
tions of the lignite and regional plan.  
 

Build-UP and Support for Regional Initiatives around Opencast Mines

In the north of the Rhenish lignite-mining area, too, some projects have already 
been implemented, especially in recent years, together with the neighbouring mu-
nicipalities of the Garzweiler opencast mine, and these have highlighted the value 
created for the region by RWE Power beyond actual lignite mining.  
These efforts are to be continued with the further development of the mine to 
the west. Hence, last year saw the constitution of an inter-municipal working 
group, consisting of representatives from the municipalities bordering the Garz-
weiler mine. The aim is to launch today already, early on and in a constructive and 
structured manner, a development process for economic valorisation geared to-
ward the social interests of the mine-rim communities, also including the later 
post-mine landscape.  
This planning for the future is taking place at different levels, so that people liv-
ing in the vicinity of the opencast mine can input their short-, medium- and long-
term ideas into the development process. In a first step, the current situation of the 
mine-rim communities must be analysed against the background of the existing 
spatial environment. Fields of action can then be derived that jointly affect the 
mine-rim communities and are mainly marked by social, property-law and infra-
structural issues.  
Finally, visions are to be developed from this that reflect the social consensus 
as regards the shape to be given to the locations. Here – depending on the specific 
situation of the municipality relative to the opencast mine – the options may range 
from a short-term enhancing of the attractiveness of recultivation and the immedi-
ate neighbourhood of the mine all the way to the valorisation of the regional econ-
omy. Development of the landscape, which is changing owing to the opencast 
operations, by providing appropriate link-ups with the settlement areas via new 
road concepts and green structures, taking account of the shape to be given to the 
residual lake, counts among the short-term measures. The pinpointed development 
of residential and industrial estates in the immediate vicinity of the Garzweiler 
opencast mine, by contrast, is part of the valorisation of the regional economy.  
The further structured fine-tuning of the planning design is to take place via a 
master-plan process. On its basis, the detailed planning for the later shape given to 
the lake can then commence at the start of the 2020s. 
2.4 
Shaping the Living Space Thanks to Modern Agriculture  
Traditionally, regional agriculture in the Rhenish lignite-mining area has had co-
operative relations with the lignite industry. It is the most important area partner 
for lignite mining, even the entire energy sector. In addition to the operating sur-
face of the opencast lignite mines and power plants, it frequently also provides the 
land for power lines. Adequate offset and compensation arrangements form a 
comprehensive basis for sustainable cooperation.  
Especially the arrangements and agreements made in connection with lignite 
extraction ensure a largely frictionless sequence of land utilisation in the run-up to 
opencast mining and the land return after recultivation. Extraordinary develop-

622 
M. Eyll-Vetter and J. Voigt
 
 
ments, like surface-relevant amendments to lignite-plan procedures, eg the re-
planning of agricultural rehabilitation in favour of a residual lake in the area of the 
Inden opencast mine or additional need for surfaces for species-conservation 
measures, lead to a scarcity of farmland. The tensions this inevitably entails can 
only be resolved in a relationship that is based on mutual trust in the partner's 
commitment.  
Cooperation has a quite practical form within the scope of agricultural rehabili-
tation. RWE's own agricultural operations, called pioneer farms, act in the regional 
agro business as customers for merchandise and services, clients, suppliers of 
agricultural goods and members of the Maschinenring cooperative. After the land 
is returned, the farmers as owners or leaseholders continue developments on recul-
tivated farmland commenced with the rehabilitation. But they also act as service 
providers for mining, be it for transport work or in air-pollution control and noise 
abatement.  
The most recent example concerns the habitat-supporting measures for pro-
tected, forest-bound species, specifically bats. Round and about the Hambach 
mine, measures are being implemented on some 700ha of agricultural land. In the 
reshaping of the necessary green-land surfaces and their utilisation with grazing 
animals, preference goes to farmers affected by measures when it comes to earth-
moving work, sowing and care during the growth phase, all the way to the later 
pastoral economy (see Fig. 5: Park-like, half-open landscapes with Glan cattle). 
 
 
Fig. 5 Park-like, half-open landscapes with Glan cattle  
Being aware as a mine operator that it is responsible to agriculture for land 
utilisation, the company is looking for novel cooperation possibilities. Worthy of 
mention here are the supply of the Neurath and Paffendorf biogas system to un-

derpin the raw-material supply as well as the Agrotherm and Hortitherm systems 
which produce asparagus, tomatoes and decorative plants under intensive condi-
tions.  
3 
Further Development of the Economic Structure  
An economic structure marked mainly by lignite and the energy sector is to give way 
in future to wider, diversified economic activity. For a mining company the question 
arises of the specific areas in which opportunities can be found and promoted.  
3.1 
Agro Business  
With this in mind, a 2010 Prognos study on the "Potenziale der Industriestan-
dortentwicklung an Braunkohlekraftwerks-Standorten" (Potentials of the devel-
opment of industrial sites at lignite-fired power-plant locations) pointed to the 
food industry, too, as target sector alongside the settlement of energy-intensive 
processing and manufacturing operations. Against this background, RWE Power 
has been successfully working for some time now on the use of heat for agricul-
tural production in conventional greenhouses or, with the Hortitherm and 
Agrotherm systems, on the use of residual heat from cooling-tower and sump 
water. In addition, talks with numerous companies in the sector based in the min-
ing area have shown that formation of a network could readily offer potentials for 
new settlement in a region marked by agriculture and the food sector.

Together with the Landgard cooperative and four garden centres, we took a 
joint decision to build NRW's biggest greenhouse at the Neurath power plant (see 
Fig. 6: Gardenlands greenhouse park). The first stage has already seen the imple-
mentation of 11ha under glass. A second stage is being planned. Heat is supplied 
by the Neurath power station. Together with local farmers, RWE also operates, on 
10ha in the Elsdorf area, an asparagus-growing surface, the so-called Agrotherm 
system, where the asparagus harvest is brought forward thanks to sump water, so 
that regional produce can be marketed much earlier (see Fig. 7: Early asparagus 
harvest thanks to Agrotherm).  
 
Fig. 7 Early asparagus harvest thanks to Agrotherm  
The long-term goal is the development of an agro business supplied by lignite 
operations: extending from the cultivation of agricultural produce, via further 
processing, packaging and, eventually, delivery to people in the region. Apart 
from substantial CO2 savings and shorter marketing channels, the idea here is to 
strengthen development in the rural area.  
3.2 
Trade and Industry  
Small and medium sized enterprises (SME) based trade and industry, with its wide 
variety of settlements in the Rhenish mining area is another factor determining 
local economic strength in addition to agriculture. The further development of the 
SME-based trade and industry structure by way of the systematic and structured 
development of industrial estates requires in-depth support from many partners. 

Build-UP and Support for Regional Initiatives around Opencast Mines 
625
 
 
RWE Power is flanking these processes and is also using its competence in devel-
oping land within the scope of rehabilitation schemes. 
As a case in point, the town of Kerpen, together with the mining company, has 
developed the "Türnich" industrial estate and business park on some 86ha of the 
recultivated Frechen opencast mine. Since 1998, about 60 companies have been 
successfully settled here, creating some 2,100 jobs (see Fig. 8: industrial estate 
Türnich III). 
 
 
Fig. 8 Industrial estate Türnich III 
In Bedburg, too, a showcase project has emerged in the shape of the Mühlenerft 
industrial estate for 34 companies covering a surface of over 100ha. With the 
extensions 
to 
the 
inter-municipal 
industrial 
estate 
in 
Grevenbro-
ich/Rommerskirchen to include a further 12ha, and with the Nievenheim am Rhein 
estate located in the extreme north of the mining area, there are other projects in 
the pipeline. What all of these projects have in common is that they are being 
developed and implemented on a partnership basis.  
For individual municipalities, job losses do occur in the wake of economic devel-
opments. However, these can be compensated in the efforts to re-design the post-
mine landscape and other surfaces no longer needed for operations. RWE is actively 
supporting such schemes and has made a substantial contribution toward the crea-
tion of over 3,500 jobs in the last ten years. This is also reflected in an investment 
boost of approx. €25 million given within the scope of land development and a fur-
ther €620 million in building construction, all triggered by the measures.

3.3 
Energy Partner / Stakeholder Models  
For the further development of the economic structure in the Rhenish mining area, 
too, expanding the use of renewable energy plays an important part. Besides risks, 
Germany's energy turnaround in close partnership with conventional energies 
offers, most of all, opportunities that are being exploited by the implementation of 
projects. Stakeholder models can constitute a future-geared concept for many of 
these projects. The term "energy partner" here refers to a partnership between 
municipalities and RWE in the field of energy generation and marketing based on 
renewables. The idea behind forming these project partnerships is to find a sensi-
ble use for the company's own land surfaces that will benefit the municipalities, 
but individuals as well. In 2012, for example, "Energiepartner Kerpen GmbH" was 
set up by the town of Kerpen and RWE. The firm has erected a photovoltaic sys-
tem with 2MW output on a noise-abatement embankment in Kerpen constructed 
by RWE. 
In January 2014, the Vereinigte Ville landfill for power-plant residues is seeing 
the commissioning of a photovoltaic system with 23,500 installed modules and a 
capacity of 3,000kWp, with an annual output of some 2.8 million kWh/a. This 
concerns a joint project by "Die BürgerEnergie eG" and RWE. Here, RWE is 
offering participation via citizen cooperatives (see Fig. 9: BürgerEnergie eG 
Ville). 
 
 
Fig. 9 BürgerEnergie eG Ville 
Together with several wind farms and in partnership with flexible lignite-fired 
power plants in the post-mine landscape, it is making renewable energy visible in 
the Rhenish mining area. These concepts are to be further expanded and, proceed-
ing along these lines, a total of over 100MW in wind farms is to be erected in the 
Rhenish mining area.

Developing Local Structures  
In parallel with the regional level, local government, too, has seen a future-geared 
planning and implementation process being established in order to shape new 
structures in the course of the changes produced by the lignite industry. Here, 
local government and mining company are jointly implementing major projects, 
thus ensuring that income flows to all those involved. The Faktor X concept is a 
prime example for this.  
4.1 
Faktor X  
For more than a decade now, RWE Power and the municipalities have been part-
ners in the development of building land in the Rhenish lignite-mining area and, 
hence, are shapers of an important part of the post-mine landscape. During this 
time, about 1,500 housing sites have been developed. This process is to be contin-
ued and further developed in the coming years with innovative projects, like the 
Faktor X model estate. In essence, the concept takes account of demographic 
change to which Germany will be exposed in the coming years that will no doubt 
lead to a contraction of the rural population and, in its wake, tend to mean pro-
nounced falls in property prices. Long-term value retention for new properties will 
thus be possible using resource-sparing and, hence, cost-lowering construction 
(see Fig. 10: Faktor X housing concept).  
 
 
Fig. 10 Faktor X housing concept  

628 
M. Eyll-Vetter and J. Voigt
 
 
In the design of residential districts, special account is to be taken in the plan-
ning phase already of a fundamental reduction in resource consumption, of the 
future viability of the site-development and civil-engineering concept, and of the 
value and flexibility of the infra-structure and residential buildings. In this sense, 
the aim of the concept development is a reduction in raw-material consumption for 
residential areas by a factor X (= 10) and, via the improved economic efficiency 
thus obtained, an enhanced attractiveness of rural life in the long term as well. 
Cooperation on this is currently taking place with the Inden municipality and the 
town of Eschweiler. Construction sites each measuring 3ha are now to be designed 
with this in mind.  
4.2 
Village-Development Concepts  
Structural changes make it important for rural communities in particular to iden-
tify their perspectives and potentials and to create the basis for structured and 
future-geared neighbourly assistance, alongside the development and implementa-
tion of specific building projects.  
To this end, the State is offering the village-development planning instrument. 
Within this framework, RWE Power is currently sponsoring, among other ideas, a 
village-development plan in Bergheim Rheidt-Hüchelhoven, a township of some 
1,800 inhabitants close to the Bergheim-Niederaussem power plant.  
This offers the option of combining measures for reducing burdens with a 
structured process for shaping the future. In workshops on key subjects, like the 
structural development of the township, the design of playgrounds, but also on the 
creation of bridleways, cycle lanes and footpaths and at workgroup meetings, 
citizens are actively involved in the planning effort, so that they can exert a direct 
influence on the future of their township.  
Qualities and deficiencies of a township are highlighted in this process and de-
velopment opportunities identified. At the end of the process is a detailed plan of 
measures which serves as guiding principle for coming years. Thanks to the good 
experience gained, RWE Power aims to accompany village-development planning 
in other townships located in the vicinity of its operations as well. 
5 
Organising the Cooperation  
A clear organisation at three levels of the cooperation ensures that planning does, 
in fact, become implementation (see Fig. 11: Partnership-based cooperation at 
different levels). An integral component of the overall concept for the Rhenish 
mining area here is the close networking of regional, local and economic  
structures.  

Build-UP and Support for Regional Initiatives around Opencast Mines 
629
 
 
 
Fig. 11 Partnership-based cooperation at different levels  
At local level, framework agreements are in place, with local government and 
mining company as partners. The agreement binds town and company to the joint 
goal, eg of implementing previously defined projects in accordance with defined 
rules. This framework agreement also provides for periodic meetings in which the 
status of processing, the deployment of funds and the next steps are addressed. 
This form of cooperation has proved extremely fruitful and is to be expanded 
further. 
Inter-municipal planning associations, like the development company Indeland 
Entwicklungsgesellschaft or Terra Nova, are proceeding from the post-mine land-
scape and giving an important boost toward sustainable development in the region. 
They form the intermediate level of the cooperation. Beyond Indeland und Terra 
Nova, new planning associations are currently being formed with the neighbour-
hood initiatives Hambach and Garzweiler. Their aim is an optimal and joint design 
of the phase of opencast-mine development along the line of townships. Also in 
view of the lake to be created at a later date and other recultivation measures, the 
scene can be set correctly early on in this way.  
The projects at municipal and inter-municipal level are also making a contribu-
tion to the initiative "Innovationsregion Rheinisches Revier" (Innovation region 
Rhenish mining area) created at State level. It represents the level of area-crossing 
approaches and is currently being realigned and, hence, geared even more closely 
to the concerns of the Rhenish mining area than in the past.

Upshot  
The Rhineland is one of the most dynamic and high-performance regions in Ger-
many, and the Rhenish lignite-mining area is one of its strongest and most lively 
modules.  
Lignite industry and region want to help actively and jointly shape the region in 
the long term. For many decades to come, lignite will remain a supporting pillar 
for the regional economy and do its bit in the economy's further diversification 
and, hence, in strengthening economic activity, and, in this way, give new partners 
space to grow in importance and perspective.

State of the Lignite Rehabilitation and Current Challenges 
In the times of the eastern block mining facilities and mineral deposits had been in 
the ownership of the public (German Democratic Republic state-property). After 
the political turn in the last period of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and 
after the German reunification the viable part of mining industry became 
privatized, for example parts of lignite mining and quarrystone industry. The non 
viable parts of mining industry had been overtaken by special federal companies. 
Lignite mines and up-grading facilities was overtaken by the federal Lausitzer und 
Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlenverwaltungsgesellschaft (LMBV). 
Before the German Reunification in 1990, almost 70 percent of the energy 
supply in the GDR originated from the mining, power generation, and upgrading 
of lignite. In comparison, this proportion only amounted to eight percent in the old 
federal states. Due to the lack of other energy sources, the GDR focused on the 
abundantly available lignite deposits. In fact, lignite mining increased fivefold 
from 1950 to 1990 in the GDR. However, as a consequence, the world’s most 
extensive lignite mining and lignite utilization had a substantial impact on the 
landscape and environment (Figure 1). 
Following Reunification, restoration of abandoned mining areas became 
particularly important in the area of the former GDR. At the end of the 1980s 
opencast mining there produced about 300 million tonnes of raw lignite per 
annum. Raw lignite covered around 70 per cent of the primary energy demand in 
the former GDR and supplied around 80 per cent of the fuel needed for power 
generation.  
The land reclamation and derelict land clearance of those areas that still had 
been under mine supervision in 1990 had been licenced using al plan of operation 
by the mining inspectorate based on the federal mining act. 
The restoration and rehabilitation of former lignite mining facilities is 
Germany’s largest environmental project. This undertaking commenced 
immediately after the German Reunification in 1990 and has reached remarkable 
results during its more than 20 years of existence. This is best illustrated by the 
newly created post-mining landscapes with their expansive woodlands and 
wildlife preserves, with lakes reclaimed from former opencast sites that are now 
embedded harmoniously into the countryside as well as newly established and 
developed industrial and commercial zones.

Legal Aspects 
The extraction of raw materials and natural resources found close to the land 
surface and mined in open-cast pits has a severe impact on the landscape. Proper 
landscaping after the shut-down of the mines has always been the responsibility of 
the mine operator. The "General Mining Act for the Prussian States", published as 
early as in 1865, contained already essential features of modern recultivation 
regulations. The rather generally worded regulations of the General Mining Act 
were then more clearly defined in a Mining Police Directive for the Rhenish 
lignite mining region issued by the then Superior Mining Authority in Bonn in 
1929: "Overburden masses shall be deposited in disused open-cast mines in such a 
way that as much land as possible is reclaimed so that it may then be given over to 
forestry and farming."  
Especially the "Practical proposals for cultivating dumpsites, fallow land, dunes 
and wasteland", published by Rudolf Heuson, the forest administrator of the 
Niederlausitzer Kohlewerke in the 1920s of the last century, are evidence for the 
long tradition and the commitment of the lignite mining industry in the Lusatian 
mining region to reclaim the post-mining land and recultivate it lastingly. 
The 1980 Federal Mining Act (Bundesberggesetz - BBergG) stipulates the 
mine operator's obligation to take preventive recultivation measures and to 
complete these measures properly after the mining operations have come to an 
end.

The production of lignite in open-cast mines has assumed such dimensions that 
the land claimed and used in the lignite mining regions of Germany has become 
the subject of separate planning activities at state level. The instrument used for 
these regional planning efforts is the so-called "Lignite Plan". 
As far as its function is concerned, lignite planning is a part of regional 
planning and must at least be allocated to the planning process at state level, as is 
the case in the federal state of Brandenburg. Special features of lignite planning 
are that the planning is closely linked both with the targets of the energy policy of 
the relevant federal state and with the mining law, This, in turn, will ensure that 
the regional plans and the mine operation plans are in accord with each other. This 
applies especially to the final operation plans, when it comes to land reclamation. 
However, it must also be pointed out in this context that the obligation of the mine 
operator to adapt the operation plans to the lignite planning, as it is laid down in 
the statutory provisions for the lignite planning, is legally disputed, since the 
BBergG (the Federal Mining Act) does not make any such reference. Only  
the "predominantly public interests", as referred to in Article § 48 II, p. 1 of the 
BBergG, would allow lignite planning finding its way into the mine operation 
planning procedure. Responsible for preparing the lignite plans is the state 
planning authority. 
Lignite planning in the form of so-called island plans for the regions affected 
by lignite mining controls the resettlement measures as well as the relocation of 
roads and ways. The lignite plan outlines in particular the rough structure of the 
post-mining landscape. Prepared by the state planning authorities in consultation 
with the Lignite Committee, the lignite plan will then be put in force by the 
government of the federal state concerned and is thus legally binding. The mine 
operator is now sufficiently informed about the objectives of state planning in his 
mining region and will take these objectives duly into account during all other 
statutorily required permit procedures. 
The mine operator indicates and identifies the long-term implications of his 
mining projects in the general operations plan that is required under mining law. 
Depending on the legal basis, this general operations plan (frame plan) will be 
dealt with and approved either as part of a simplified administrative procedure or 
in the course of a public works planning procedure, if the operations exceed 
environmentally relevant limits, which is usually the case with the lignite mining. 
Due to the provisions contained in the Energy Contract (Unification Treaty of 
September 23, 1990), operations in the open-cast lignite mines of the new federal 
states were deemed to be procedures in progress and continued on the basis of 
frame plans in accordance with Article § 52, paragraph 2, of the BBergG 
(simplified administrative procedure). In accordance with the provisions contained 
in the State Planning Act of the federal state of North-Rhine Westphalia (LPLG 
NRW), the environmental impact assessment (UVP) will be carried out as part of 
the lignite planning procedure. The mine operator includes a schedule for the land 
reclamation measures in the frame plan which has to be drawn up in line with the 
mining law. This schedule cannot be very detailed as yet, since the measures to be 
taken refer to a period some decades ahead.

The mine operator is only entitled to start operations, after the main operations 
plan has been approved. The approval usually covers a period of two years. The 
main operations plan includes early statements about land reclamation. This 
means for the mining operations to determine the way how the overburden is 
dumped (overburden management), to produce substrates that are suitable for 
cultivating the reclaimed land (creation of loess reserves) as well as to take the 
general profile of the landscape into account. 
The mine operator will have to submit a final operations plans as required by 
the mining law, when the entire company or parts thereof cease operating and 
when the land is to be returned to any other use but mining. In the sense of an 
early integration of the main operations plan and the final operations plan, it has 
been a practical advantage to prepare a final operations plan also for those "units 
of the mining company which are still active". The preventive land reclamation 
measures, as contained in the main operations plan and implemented accordingly, 
can then be smoothly transferred into measures for shaping the final land surface. 
The final operations plan contains the details of how the more general 
requirements concerning the "proper land reclamation", as enshrined in the 
Federal Mining Act, will be satisfied. 
The BBergG defines the term "proper" (land reclamation) only partly. A more 
detailed definition as to what land reclamation is supposed to mean can be found 
in the state-specific mining directives (such as the Mining Directive for Lignite 
Mines/BVOBr of the Superior Mining Authority of the federal state of North-
Rhine Westphalia) and in guidelines issued by the state mining authorities.  
The Land Reclamation Directive of the state mining authority of Brandenburg 
(LBGR), which has been prepared in close cooperation between the mine 
operators and the environmental and mining authorities of the federal state of 
Brandenburg, contains details as to how land can be reclaimed which is intended 
for forest and agricultural use, i.e. the main branches of land utilization in post-
mining areas. Based on the soil substrates prevalent in the Lusatian region, the 
directive makes reference to the technical suitability of these substrates for soil 
cultivation measures. A separate section of the directive deals with land 
reclamation under the aspect of nature conservation. The directive demands that 
the reclaimed land is integrated as speedily as possible into the existing landscape 
and connected with the neighboring biotopes that have existed before and are 
intact. Biotope systems linked with each other, special areas of land as well as 
integration measures taken in the forest and agricultural sector are named and 
shown as a suitable approach to promoting this integration process. The positive 
effects of a successive use of large land areas are also mentioned. 
Apart from the mining standards in their own right, the final operations plan is 
the vehicle for implementing further statutory requirements concerning land 
reclamation. Take the Federal Soil Protection Act (BBodSchG) as an example: It 
does not contain any independent provisions as to mining projects requiring 
approval, but it stipulates the physical requirements how to treat the land and how 
to handle the soil, i.e. provisions which will have to be observed during the 
permitting procedure for the mine operations plan. Likewise, these requirements 

State of the Lignite Rehabilitation and Current Challenges 
635
 
will also have to be satisfied when materials, such as soil improving substances or 
waste materials, are deposited in the ground or on the land surface. The specific 
requirements as regards soil protection usually cover a rooting depth of about 2 m 
for any subsequent vegetation. 
Apart from the impact the soil protection provisions have on the land 
reclamation process, as has been outlined above, the provisions contained in the 
Water Management Act (WHG) and in the state water laws are also of great 
importance. The mass deficit created by the extraction of raw materials in the 
mining area will usually result in the formation of lakes, for which a permitting 
procedure under the water law is required, if they are to be developed further.  
In the process of implementing all the different statutory regulations referred to 
in the mining license, which is undoubtedly a necessary requirement, one will 
have to bear in mind that these mining regulations must be carefully weighed 
against each other. All these requirements that are meant to regulate the mining 
operations from outside must not lead to a situation in which the mining privilege 
would eventually be strangulated and any vested rights be disregarded. The 
statutory requirements will have to keep within the clearly defined framework 
created and limited by the state planning regulations or by the mining license.  
The proper implementation of the land reclamation process is closely connected 
with the end of the supervision through the mining authorities. In accordance with 
Article § 69 of the BBergG, "the supervision through the mining authorities ceases 
after the final operations plan has been implemented ... i.e. at the time when, 
according to common knowledge and experience, detrimental effects with negative 
consequences for the general public … are no longer expected". A period of 5-7 
years will usually pass between the land reclamation and the end of the supervision 
through the mining authorities. This time is required to establish the fundamental 
success of the land reclamation efforts. It is quite possible to make statements about 
future positive developments as regards the reclaimed land after some time of 
intermediate land use for forest and agricultural purposes. Although the end of the 
supervision through the mining authorities is stipulated by law, the mining regions 
usually take measures, such as final inspections or planning notifications, that refer 
to the end of the mining authorities' responsibilities in this respect.  
The success achieved in the field of land reclamation in all mining regions 
during the recent decades has shown that the lignite mining industry creates new 
landscapes that do not leave any scars in the countryside and merge very well with 
it. The increasing commitment of the lignite industry in this respect has reached a 
very high level by now, and the success thus achieved has contributed 
considerably to a further improvement of the image of lignite mining. 
1.2 
The Company LMBV 
The Lausitz and Central-German Mining Administration Company (LMBV) was 
established on 9th August 1994 by the trust institution as a company for the 
decommissioning and rehabilitation of mining pits in the lignite regions of Lausitz 
and Central Germany. It is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany, represented 
by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The last production sites of LMBV lignite 

636 
K. Freytag and H.-G. Thiem
 
mining were taken out of operation at the end of 1999. Since then the focus of 
activities lies in the rehabilitation and recovery and increasingly also in the 
reclamation of the areas claimed for lignite mining. With this the foundations are 
laid for a comprehensive restructuring and recovery of the former mining regions. 
Approximately 107,000 hectares of the areas claimed for mining in Germany 
lay originally in LMBV’s area of responsibility. Up to now more than 23,000 
hectares of agricultural and forest areas have already been reclaimed and several 
thousand hectares are left to develop naturally. So far over 10,200 hectares of 
wooded areas have been newly established and for this over 100 million trees have 
been planted. The reclamation rate for LMBV lies at 60 percent in Lausitz and at 
74 percent in Central Germany. 
The extraction of lignite had a massive effect on the water balance in both 
regions. Therefore until 1990 a depression in ground water level arose which 
reached to a depth of 80 metres. For restoration of balanced water resources that 
are extensively capable of self-regulation, it is in the long term necessary to 
recharge approx. 12.7 billion cubic metres of water into the aquifers and the 
mining lakes of the mentioned areas. Through replenishment of the aquifers and 
flooding from outside water sources up until now more than half has been 
rebalanced. So far ten of the larger 46 openmining lakes have reached the final 
water level while another 28 are still being flooded (Figure 2).

However, there were also the less positive aspects of this intensive lignite 
mining and use: firstly, a leading position with regard to the per capita load of 
typical lignite pollutants such as SO2 or dust, and secondly, extreme ecological 
damage, for example: 
 The devastation of large areas (around 120,000 hectares) needed 
for the opencast mines and the lignite processing plants 
 Severe interventions in the hydrological regime of the lignite 
mining region; 
 The filling of worked-out open casts with both residues from 
lignite processing and industrial and municipal waste. 
Therefore the intended rehabilitation of abandoned lignite mining sites in 
former East Germany comprised many tasks: 
 Securing, rehabilitation and final landscaping of 215 worked-out 
open casts in 31 opencast mining areas. 
Of the 215 worked-out open casts, 163 are to be landscaped as 
lakes, 28 have to be filled and the slopes of 24 dry ones have to be 
secured.  
 Around 1,063 km of slopes have to be secured, around 535 km of 
them facing potential liquefaction slumping, 
 Demolition  
o 
of 57 briquette factories  
o 
of 48 industrial power plants and boiler houses  
o 
of 2 coking plants, 2 low-temperature carbonisation 
plants and 1 gas works  
The rehabilitation of the large scale industrial wasteland resulting from the 
demolition of the facilities, which in general covered large areas.  
Work on these tremendous tasks was started at the beginning of the 1990s. The 
Federation and the so-called 'lignite federal states’ in the former GDR, i.e. Saxony, 
Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, decided to allocate massive funds to 
the rehabilitation project. As the owner of the areas and facilities to be 
rehabilitated, Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle-Verwaltungsgesellschaft 
(LMBV – Lausitz and Central-German Mining Administration Company), acted 
as project leader. It was responsible for planning the rehabilitation, issuing 
invitations to tender and contracts and for controlling the execution of the work.  
In dealing with these tremendous tasks various technical, economic and 
ecological targets had to be taken into account. In addition, there were social, in 
particular labour market aspects to be taken into consideration, especially due to 
the high number of redundancies resulting from the extensive closures of mines.  
1.3 
Rehabilitation of Opencast Mines 
The rehabilitation of the opencast mines comprised various tasks, in particular: 
 Securing the steep slopes of the worked-out open casts which were in 
danger of slumping  

638 
K. Freytag and H.-G. Thiem
 
 Acceleration of the slow natural refilling of the worked-out open casts 
with water by using water from nearby rivers as well as draining water 
from opencast mines still in operation  
 Recultivation of the artificial waste heap bottoms by soil improving 
measures, using the areas for agriculture and forestry and by making 
areas available for natural development and successions with substantial 
nature conservation potential.  
Facilities for lignite coal upgrading which had been in operation for decades 
had to be decommissioned at more than 100 sites. This comprised briquette 
factories, power plants, heating stations, low-temperature carbonisation plants, 
coking plants, gas works and related facilities. They were technically outdated and 
very often contaminated by residue and pollutant depositions. In addition, soil and 
groundwater pollution had to be coped with. On the other hand, infrastructure was 
well developed in many cases, offering considerable development potential for 
such sites. 
The rehabilitation of such sites comprised mainly: 
 Dismantling the facilities by gutting and scrapping, demolition of the 
buildings including removal of underground floors (depending on the 
pollutant load), recycling of non-contaminated material and its reuse as 
construction material during the rehabilitation project. 
 Removal and disposal of contaminated soil. This is particularly complex 
with tar products which cannot be pumped, desulphurisation products and 
carbonisation gas residues in installations, containers and pipes. In 
individual cases the volumes amounted to several thousand tonnes.  
 Reuse or disposal of residues and pollutants amounting to several 
100,000 tonnes, which were stored in large industrial settling basins or 
landfills that did not meet the technical security requirements for such 
installations. 
 Assessment 
of 
groundwater 
contamination 
and 
purification 
of 
groundwater. 
1.4 
Restoration of a Largely Self-regulating Hydrological 
Regime 
Groundwater deficits amounting to 12.7 billion cubic metres, distorted surface 
water discharge conditions in large areas and lakes forming due to rising 
groundwater in the worked-out open casts have severely affected the hydrological 
regime and will continue to do so in the future. They are considered the main 
ecological damage caused by lignite mining. Restoring a well balanced, largely 
self-regulating hydrological regime is therefore central to the rehabilitation of 
abandoned lignite mining sites. In view of the tremendous water deficits and the 
danger of water acidification resulting from the pyrite oxidation in the waste 
heaps, it is vital to master the problems with regard to water volumes and water 
quality.  

State of the Lignite Rehabilitation and Current Challenges 
639
 
The most efficient solution to this problem is to flood the largest worked-out 
open casts with both water from nearby rivers and draining water from opencast 
mines still in operation. This enables the worked-out open casts to refill in only a 
tenth of the time natural refilling would take and also speeds up the replenishing 
of aquifers. In addition, neutral external water helps to fight acidification in the 
opencast mining lakes. Where this is not achieved, as for example in the Lausitz 
region, neutralising treatment of the water is necessary.  
1.5 
Rehabilitation of Existing Polluted Sites  
In the area of the rehabilitation project more than 1,200 areas were documented as 
potentially polluted sites as per the 31 December 2004.  
The most common problem at the polluted sites is waste deposited in the 
worked-out open casts and small scale soil pollutions, so-called leakages, in 
production areas with machinery and vehicle fleets. These were dealt with in a 
standardised way and disposed of within the framework of the geotechnical 
rehabilitation of the slopes and the demolition of facilities. The need to trim 
landfills due to rising groundwater levels is a specific problem occurring when 
rehabilitating abandoned lignite mining sites.  
Soil and ground water rehabilitation in the areas of former upgrading facilities 
such as coking plants and low-temperature carbonisation plants calls for a more 
complex rehabilitation concept. It is more time consuming and costly due to the 
typical pollutant load arising from upgrading raw lignite: petroleum-derived 
hydrocarbons, phenols, monoaromatics and polycyclical aromatic hydrocarbons. 
The best known sites in this context in Germany are Espenhain and Deuben in 
former East Germany and Schwarze Pumpe und Lauchhammer in the Lausitz 
region. 
1.6 
Financing 
Between 1991 and 2013 more than 9.4 billion Euro were earmarked for the 
rehabilitation of abandoned lignite mining sites. The Federation contributed the 
greatest part of this, 75 per cent. The federal states concerned, i.e. Brandenburg, 
Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia, contributed 25 per cent to the funding, 
particularly in view of the fact that rehabilitating the abandoned lignite mining 
sites also improves the conditions for the economic development of this former 
lignite mining area. About eight billion Euros were used by LMBV for the 
securing of decommissioned open pits and further necessary work for 
rehabilitation. The company LMBV is aware of its huge responsibility towards the 
people of both regions. The company’s 24-year experience in the matter of 
rehabilitation and reclamation of landscapes affected by mining will also be used 
over the coming years to continue the previous success and thus support the 
structural change of the regions.

1.7 
Results of the Rehabilitation and New Challenges 
The basic mining engineering rehabilitation has for the most part been concluded. 
Almost all of the slopes have been stabilised - a total length equalling the distance 
between Paris and Berlin. More than 50 per cent of the waste heaps have been 
recultivated for agricultural or forestry purposes.  
The last phase of rehabilitation, the complex restoration of a well-balanced 
hydrological regime in an area which is almost one and a half times as large as the 
Lima Metropolitana region is under way at present and will also be the focus of 
future work.  
In order to restore a well-balanced, almost self-regulating hydrological regime 
the aquifers and opencast mining lakes have to be replenished with 12.7 billion 
cubic metres of water. By replenishing the aquifers and using external water 
sources, around 6.5 billion cubic metres of water have already been achieved.  
Marketing the newly landscaped areas is well under way. They are purchased 
by local authorities, nature conservation associations, foundations and private 
individuals. By the end of 2005, a total of around 53,500 hectares of former 
mining sites had been transferred to new owners. 
New ecologically sustainable landscapes with economic potential are emerging 
from the largest landscape construction site in Europe - from Wulfersdorf near 
Helmstedt via Nachterstedt and the valley of the river Geisel up to the very heart 
of the East German mining area in the triangle formed by the cities of Halle, 
Leipzig and Bitterfeld. This also holds true for the Lausitz region, from the 
Spreewald to Dresden and further on to Görlitz and Zittau. 
The major nature conservation project Lausitzer Seenland (Lake District 
Lausitz) is the high value centrepiece of the chain of lakes coming into existence 
which will constitute a water landscape of transregional importance. In addition to 
the Lakes Senftenberg, Knappen and Silbersee which arose many years ago from 
abandoned mining sites and are now popular tourist destinations, step by step 
another 15 lakes will come into existence in Saxony and Brandenburg thanks to 
the flooding of former opencast mining areas. In the central area of the Lake 
District Lausitz alone, with all its connecting navigable channels, a water surface 
area will be created which in Germany will be second only to Lake Constance in 
size.  
In their final stage these new landscapes will be dominated by around 27,000 
hectares of water and almost 18,000 hectares of nature conservation areas. They 
will improve the quality of life in the former mining areas considerably and offer 
substantial tourism potential. 
In addition, the new industrial parks with their excellent infrastructure offering 
several thousand new jobs are no longer just a vision but have already started to 
become reality.

And there is also the technical and expert knowledge which was gained in the 
course of the rehabilitation works and which should not be undervalued. 
Companies like LMBV as project leader in the project presented here stand for 
high levels of competence with regard to the technical know how and 
management skills needed for such a complex rehabilitation project. With its 
experience and knowledge it is an attractive partner - in Germany as well as 
abroad. German experience in the field of rehabilitating abandoned mine sites is 
sought after.  
Preventive care pays off. It saves a lot of money later on during rehabilitation. 
Therefore rehabilitation aspects should be included at a very early stage, i.e. when 
opening up a new mine.  
Rehabilitation can be expensive but it pays off as well. Making use of specific 
know-how and appropriate technologies can help reduce costs in the medium and 
long run.  
Do not postpone rehabilitation for too long. It should be tackled as soon as 
possible and in an effective way. This will bring about excellent result at relatively 
low costs.  
The rehabilitation reached in 2012 a high level of good results in land 
rehabilitation and new use of former mining used areas. 
But there are still challenges in Geotechnical and water issues. The refill of 
Groundwater reached good results but because of this we had Acid Mine Drainage 
(AMD) and instable dumps. The instable areas be located suddenly in old 
rehabilitated areas in 2006; these areas were in forest used since over 30 years. We 
know the problem of instable slopes and the focus was from the beginning to 
stabilize them, but not the areas behind. The philosophy was, that more than 3 – 5 
meters of dry overburden is enough for stable land use. But now we are smarter 
and the universities are looking for new methods of stabilization. 
The AMD in the new post mining lakes are solved with Inlake-Treatment (lime 
ship). By this method we bring lakes of a dimension of ha in good stable 
conditions. 
In the years of 2008 and 2011 we had large rain fall in the Lusatia. This had a 
high rate of refill of groundwater, so large areas came early in contact with drains 
as we expected. By this process we had a large drainage of FeO2 . So the rivers in 
the old mining areas get brown colored. Our strategy now is to build a protective 
wall to protected the naturally heritage of the Spreewald. 
Because of the clogging of the river spree the LMBV together with the LBGR 
had developed a 10-point emergency program (Figure 3).
