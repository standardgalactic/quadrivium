Authors’ Acknowledgments
Thanks to acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who chose us to
author this book and guided us through the tough part of getting
started and to our agent, Neil Salkind of StudioB (www.StudioB.com),
who ironed out all the preliminary details to make this book possible.
Chad Sievers, our project editor, deserves a loud cheer for acting as a
very patient collaborator and gifted editor — shuffling chapters back
and forth, shepherding the text through production, making sure any
technical issues were properly resolved, and serving as the unofficial
quality control manager. Megan Knoll, our copy editor, earns an editor
of the year award for ferreting out our typos, misspellings, grammatical
errors, and other language faux pas-es, in addition to assisting Chad as
reader advocate — asking the questions we should have asked our-
selves. And, we tip our hats to the production crew for doing such an
outstanding job of transforming a loose collection of text and illustra-
tions into such an attractive bound book.
We also wish to express our appreciation to the National Association
of Mortgage Brokers, National Association of Realtors®, the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America, and the Michigan Mortgage Brokers
Association for their support and assistance. 
We owe special thanks to our technical editor, Patrick Lecomte, for
flagging technical errors in the manuscript, helping guide its con-
tent, and offering his own tips, tricks, and insights from the world of
real estate financing.

Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies

Introduction
R
eal estate investing is an expensive habit. You need money to
finance the purchase, renovate your fixer-upper, and cover
the holding costs while you prepare to sell or rent the property.
The good news is that it doesn’t all have to be your money. In fact,
the less of your own money you can use and the more you can
borrow, the bigger the return on your investment. Add the poten-
tial credit and market woes like the first decade of the 2000s, and
investing in real estate also becomes a bit more of an adventure.
Lining up financial resources well in advance of scouring the neigh-
borhood for investment opportunities enables you to pounce on a
bargain and gives you leverage in negotiating the price you ulti-
mately pay for a property. When you place an offer on a house and
other bids come in, the seller may accept your offer of thousands
of dollars less simply because you have the financing in place to
quickly close the deal. Ready cash also frees you to plan and begin
rehabbing the property immediately instead of waiting around for
sluggish loan approvals and credit checks.
If you’re thinking that you can’t possibly get your mitts on enough
cash to finance your venture, Financing Real Estate Investments For
Dummies is the book for you. Here you discover the best sources
for investment capital and how to go about tapping into these
sources to fuel your next venture.
About This Book
This book isn’t a get-rich-quick guide to investing in real estate 
or a guide or a tutorial on how to buy property with no money
down (although we do cover that topic). Financing Real Estate
Investments For Dummies delivers what the title promises — a
treasure map that shows you where to find sources of real estate
investment capital and guidance on how to dig it up.
Ralph and Chip are both seasoned investors. We’ve each built wealth
through investing in real estate — buying and selling fixer-uppers and
buying and renting out both residential and commercial property.
Although we have used our own money on occasion to finance our
purchases and renovations, we’ve primarily succeeded with the
use of other people’s money (OPM). Our grandmothers were our
first financial backers, but we’ve expanded our options since then.

We have more than 50 years’ worth of combined experience in
buying and selling real estate and securing the financing to do it. In
this book, we share what we know with you, showing you how to
tap into loans from banks; mortgage companies; private lenders;
federal, state, and local government programs; and more. In the
process we cover financing for both residential and commercial
properties.
Conventions Used in This Book
Compared to other books on financing real estate investments,
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies is anything but con-
ventional, but we do use some conventions to call your attention
to certain items. For example:
 Italics highlight new, somewhat technical terms, such as hard
money, and emphasize words when we’re driving home a
point.
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted and numbered
lists.
 Monofont highlights Web addresses.
Financing the purchase and renovation of residential properties,
such as homes, is quite different from financing the purchase and
renovation of commercial properties. You deal with different
lenders who use different methods for evaluating your loan appli-
cation and the property you’re planning to buy.
In this book, we cover both types of financing, but you should
know up front the differences between residential and commercial
property:
 Residential: One- to four-family dwellings classify as residen-
tial properties, which qualify for residential financing.
 Commercial: Properties used to conduct business and any
rental properties designed to house more than four families
qualify as commercial real estate. Loan approval for these
properties hinges more on the property’s potential for gener-
ating sufficient income to make the payments than on the bor-
rower’s financial strength.
In addition, even though you see three author names on the cover
of this book — Chip, Ralph, and Joe — the “we” is usually Chip and
Ralph talking. Joe is the wordsmith — the guy responsible for
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies

keeping you engaged and entertained and making sure we explain
everything as clearly and thoroughly as possible.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we encourage you to read this book from cover to cover
to maximize the return on your investment, we realize that in
today’s busy world you may have time to read only the information
pertinent to your situation. If so, you can safely skip anything you
see in a gray shaded box. We stuck this material in a box for the
same reason that most people stick stuff in boxes — to get it out of
the way, so you wouldn’t trip over it. However, you may find the
stories and brief asides uproariously funny and perhaps even
mildly informative (or vice versa).
Foolish Assumptions
We assume you already mastered the basics of investing in real
estate. If you haven’t, we encourage you to pick up a copy of either
(or both) Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric
Tyson and Robert S. Griswold, or Commercial Real Estate Investing
For Dummies by Peter Conti and Peter Harris (Wiley).
If you’re interested in flipping houses or focusing on foreclosure
properties, check out Flipping Houses For Dummies or Foreclosure
Investing For Dummies by Ralph R. Roberts with Joe Kraynak. If
you’re thinking of becoming a landlord, we strongly encourage you
to first read Property Management For Dummies by Robert S.
Griswold. Not everyone has the right stuff to be a landlord, but if
you know what you’re getting into before you take on the role, you
can significantly improve your survival odds.
How This Book Is Organized
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies facilitates a skip-
and-dip approach. It presents the information in easily digestible
chunks, so you can skip to the chapter or section that grabs your
attention or meets your current needs, master it, and then skip to
another section or simply set the book aside for later reference.
To help you navigate, we took the 17 chapters that make up the
book and divvied them up into five parts. Here, we provide a quick
overview of what we cover in each part.
Introduction
3

Part I: Gearing Up for Financing
Your Real Estate Investments
When you become a real estate investor, you’re essentially building
a business; you should build it on a strong foundation. In this part,
we cover the basics, providing you with definitions of standard ter-
minology and concepts you’re likely to encounter, introducing you
to the various sources of investment capital, showing you how to
protect yourself against potential risks, and leading you through
the process of gathering all the documents and other information
you need to apply for financing.
In the process, we reveal the power of using OPM to gain leverage
and expose your own money and other assets to less risk.
Part II: Financing the Purchase 
of Residential Properties
In this part, we explore the many residential loan programs cur-
rently available, show you how to compare different loan packages
to find the one that costs the least overall, and lead you through
the loan application process from filling out the forms to closing.
By the end of this part, you should have the financing you need to
start hunting for residential real estate investment opportunities.
Part III: Financing the Purchase 
of Commercial Properties
In this part, we introduce you to the most common commercial
property types, so you can choose the type best suited to your
investment goals and evaluate the properties based on their poten-
tial for generating a positive cash flow. We take you on a tour of
some of the unique sources of financing available for commercial
ventures. Finally, we step you through the process of applying for
commercial real estate loans from application to closing.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative
Financing Strategies
In this part, you discover the pros and cons of hard money — cash
that’s generally easier but more expensive to borrow for purchasing
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies

investment properties. We also show you how to finance the pur-
chase through the seller by purchasing properties on contract,
how to partner with an investor who’s cash heavy, and how to
track down no-money-down deals.
These options aren’t for everybody, but when you’re in the market
for investment properties and can’t get your hands on conven-
tional financing, these unconventional sources can be a deal saver.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is the highlight of every For Dummies title, offer-
ing quick strategies, tips, and insights on whatever subject the
book covers. The chapters in this Part of Tens reveal how to avoid
the ten most common mistakes when financing real estate invest-
ments, which questions you should ask prospective lenders, ten
steps to take to prepare for your next closing, and ten strategies
for surviving a credit crunch.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we sprinkle icons in the margins to cue you
in on different types of information that call out for your attention.
Here are the icons you’ll see and a brief description of each.
We want you to remember everything you read in this book, but if
you can’t quite do that, be sure to remember the important points
flagged with this icon.

Where to Go From Here
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies is sort of like an
information kiosk. You can start with the chapters in Part I to
master the basics and then skip to Part II if you’re planning on
financing the purchase of residential property or Part III if your
focus is more on commercial properties.
Introduction

For a quick primer on financing the purchase of real estate invest-
ments, check out Chapter 1. Chapter 4 is a great place to start if
you’re not sure where to start looking for lenders — this chapter
touches on everything from banks and mortgage companies to pri-
vate lenders and partnering with others who have cash.
We do consider Chapter 6 required reading. All too often investors
get burned because they focus too much on interest rates and not
on other factors contributing to the overall cost of borrowing
money. This chapter offers a quick way to compare two loans side-
by-side to determine which one costs less over the life of the loan.
If you’re planning to invest in commercial properties, Chapter 8 is
also required reading. In this chapter, we show you how to evalu-
ate different types of properties the way lenders do it when you
apply for a loan.
If you’re looking for information on a very specific topic, flip to the
back of the book, where you can find a comprehensive index of key
topics.

Part I
Gearing Up for
Financing Your Real
Estate Investments

In this part . . .
T
he key to scoring affordable ﬁnancing and keeping a
bigger chunk of your after-tax proﬁts from real estate
investments is preparation. By understanding the leverage
you can gain using other people’s money (OPM) to ﬁnance
your investments and having all your ﬁnancial records in
place, you increase your odds of securing ﬁnancing with
attractive terms and interest rates.
By understanding tax laws and loopholes before you get
started, you can lay the groundwork necessary to maxi-
mize your tax deductions and exclusions and keep more
proﬁt for yourself. And by understanding the differences
between different types of lenders, you gain access to
additional sources of investment capital you may never
have considered.
In this part, we help you build your real estate investment
venture on a ﬁrm foundation so you have ready access to
cash while minimizing your exposure to risk.

A
re you eager to set out on the road to building wealth through
real estate? Although we hate to hold you back, we do dis-
courage you from moving forward without the proper preparation.
Our advice doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that you need to
read the entire book from cover to cover before you purchase your
first investment property.
Here, we provide a quick primer on real estate financing along with
what you need to do to secure financing for your real estate invest-
ments. We also provide a generous supply of references to other
chapters in the book where you can find more detailed information
on specific topics. So without further ado, let the real estate financ-
ing primer begin.
Don’t let negative economic and credit information dampen your
desire to invest in real estate. The best time to purchase real estate
is when prices are low. You can still find and secure financing; you
just may need to look and work a little harder and smarter to get it.

Pumping Up Your Purchasing
Power with Borrowed Money
If you have any reservations about borrowing money to buy real
estate, you need to overcome those reservations by developing a
better understanding of leverage — using borrowed money to buy
more and better properties, thus improving your chances of earn-
ing bigger profits.
In the following sections, we show you why the goal of owning a
property free and clear isn’t such a smart move, reveal the secret
of leveraging the power of borrowed money, and explain how you
can offer “cash” for properties even when financing the purchase.
Although we encourage investors to borrow money to increase
their leverage, keep in mind that borrowing money can carry signif-
icant risks. As an investor, you can take action to minimize the
risks — by carefully evaluating your real estate market and proper-
ties under consideration, overestimating costs, underestimating
profits, developing realistic backup plans, and so on; however you
can never completely eliminate the risk. You have to decide for
yourself what an acceptable level of risk is.
Minimizing your potential by owning
property free and clear
For many Americans, paying off their mortgage early and owning
their home free and clear is the real American dream. Life would be
so much better if they didn’t have to deal with a house payment.
For real estate investors, however, owning property free and clear
means that valuable equity is locked up in those properties —
equity they can use to finance the purchase of other revenue-
generating real estate. Don’t get caught in the trap of thinking that
paying off a mortgage loan is a smart move — it may be a noble
goal, but it’s rarely a savvy strategy.
Maximizing your potential 
with other people’s money
Other people’s money (or OPM for short) is money that you borrow
from other people to finance your investments. OPM isn’t much of
a secret. Assuming you own a home, you probably used OPM to
buy it. You may have put down 5 to 10 percent of your own money
as a down payment and then borrowed the rest.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
10

In most cases, OPM helps you earn a profit. When you calculate in
the appreciation of the home, the tax savings it represents, infla-
tion, and other factors, you’re likely to earn more money off the
home than you pay out in interest over the life of the loan — 
barring a major housing meltdown.
The same applies to your real estate investments. The more OPM
you can put to work for you, the more you stand to earn — as long
as your earnings from it exceed the cost of borrowing it. For more
info about OPM, check out Chapter 5.
Paying cash with borrowed money
In the world of real estate, cash is king. The buyer who shows up
with cash is in a significantly stronger position to purchase a prop-
erty and negotiate an attractive price and terms than a buyer who
shows up needing financing.
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 11
Dealing with a major credit crunch
The mortgage meltdown, foreclosure epidemic, and global financial crisis that all
came to a head in 2008 led many real estate investors to believe that credit had all
but dried up. Banks were failing left and right, and the United States was forced to
step in with more than $1 trillion in economic rescue funds to keep cash flowing to
individuals and businesses that needed credit. Surely, real estate investors would
be the last on the list for cheap and easy credit.
Actually, the credit crunch didn’t put real estate investors out of business. In fact,
in many cases, it made conditions better for investors:
 When the bubble burst, properties became much more affordable. Investors
could buy better properties for less money.
 As millions of people worked through foreclosure, demand for rental properties
soared.
 Financial institutions, eager to rid their books of empty, expensive, cash-sucking
foreclosures, became more willing to offer great deals. I (Chip) just had a client
pay $82,000 for a brand new property with a market value of about $275,000. The
bank had taken it back from a builder, was more than glad to just get it off the
books, and was willing to finance it with a 15-year loan.
A credit crunch doesn’t mean that financing disappears — it just means that you
probably need to look for it in some unusual places. Even FHA has investor financ-
ing with 25 percent down — and a lot of foreclosures they’re willing to deal on.
Throughout this book, we show you how to tap into these markets — credit crunch
and all.

When we say cash is king, however, we’re not advising you to show
up with a suitcase full of money. We’re telling you to show up with
preapproved financing — a financial backer who can deliver the
cash on closing day. In other words, although you’re financing the
purchase as explained throughout this book, you’re still placing
yourself in a position to offer cash.
Brushing Up on Basic Real 
Estate Financing Lingo
Throughout this book, we toss around some jargon common in the
real estate and mortgage lending industries. To the average con-
sumer, these terms may sound Greek, but we assure you that
they’re part of the English language. In the following sections, we
define the most common and often misunderstood of these terms.
Identifying types of lenders
The moneymen and -women you deal with when securing financing
for purchasing investment property play various roles in the
process. You need to know whom you’re working with:
 Commercial lenders: They’re financial institutions rather
than individuals. They include banks, credit unions, mutual
savings banks, savings and loan associations, and stock sav-
ings banks. (Chapter 9 discusses commercial lenders in
greater detail.)
 Private lenders: A private lender is any individual who loans
money outside the channels of institutional lending. This
person can be a friend or relative, such as your Aunt Mabel,
or an investor. Real estate investors often rely on private
lenders for access to investment capital when banks and
other financial institutions turn them down. (For more about
private lenders, check out Chapter 11.)
 Mortgage banker: Mortgage bankers are financial institutions
that directly fund home loans and either service those loans
themselves (arranging and collecting monthly payments and
managing any escrow accounts) or sell the mortgages to
investors and contract out the servicing of the loans.
 Servicer: The servicer is the institution contracted or
appointed to collect the monthly payments from the bor-
rower. They have to account for all payments and disburse-
ments and provide yearly statements showing all transactions
within a mortgage account to the borrower.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
12

 Mortgage broker: Mortgage brokers are licensed by the state
to assist borrowers in finding mortgage lenders, comparing
loan programs, applying for mortgage loans, and securing
financing for purchasing real estate. They act as the eyes and
ears for many different mortgage lenders.
 Loan officer: Loan officers work for mortgage bankers or bro-
kers to assist clients in securing financing for purchasing real
estate. They essentially do the same thing brokers do, but
they have to work for a licensed broker or lender.
 Loan originator: Another name for a mortgage broker or loan
officer.
See Chapter 4 for more on these types of lenders.
Grasping different loan types
Throughout this book, we introduce you to various types of loans
for financing the purchase of real estate, including conforming and
nonconforming loans, jumbo loans, and hard money loans. In the
following list, we define the most common loan types and toss in
some additional information that you may find useful.
 Conforming loan: A conforming loan is one that meets the cri-
teria set forth by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac — the organiza-
tions that purchase the loans and then package them up to
sell on Wall Street. In general, to qualify for a conforming loan,
the borrower must
• Show sufficient income to cover monthly payments.
• Have enough cash for a down payment and reserves.
• Have a good credit history.
For additional details about conforming loans and current cri-
teria, visit the Fannie Mae Web site at www.efanniemae.com.
 Nonconforming loans: These include everything else outside
the Fannie/Freddie box. Sometimes referred to in the market
as subprime or even exotic loans, they’re bought by other
financial companies or investment banks and packaged to be
sold to Wall Street investors. When the subprime market suf-
fers, as it did starting in 2008, far fewer of these types of secu-
rities make it to market.
 Conventional loans: These loans are outside the sphere 
of the government. In other words, they’re not FHA- or VA-
secured loans and aren’t underwritten by any government
agency.
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 13

 Jumbo loans: As its name suggests, a jumbo loan represents a
lot of money — specifically, more money than you can borrow
under the limits of a conforming loan.
 Hard money loans: Also referred to as bridge loans, they’re
typically short-term, high-interest loans that enable investors
to get their mitts on some cash in a hurry. You can expect to
pay several points upfront (a point is equivalent to one per-
cent of the total loan amount) plus up to double the going
interest rate. (For more about hard money and strategies for
using it to your advantage, check out Chapter 11.)
 Government loan programs: The government isn’t really in the
business of loaning money to homeowners and investors, but 
it facilitates the process for lenders by insuring the loans — if
the borrower defaults on the loan, the government steps in to
cover any losses for the lender.
The two most common government loan programs are Federal
Housing Authority (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA)
loans. But federal, state, and local governments also provide
loan programs to encourage investment in disaster areas and
neighborhoods that they’re seeking to develop. Within the
FHA and VA programs are some great hidden opportunities for
investors. (See Chapter 4 for more about specific government
loan programs.)
Brushing up on important legal lingo
Even though real estate deals are generally classified as financial,
they involve plenty of legalities, especially in relation to who owns
the property or has a stake in it. Although real estate–related legal
terms can fill an entire dictionary, you should have a working
knowledge of the following three:
 Deed: A deed is a legal document that grants rights to a prop-
erty. Whenever you purchase a property, whoever is handling
the closing must file the deed with the county’s register of
deeds to make the transfer of ownership official. As the offi-
cial owner, you have the right to borrow against the property
and transfer your rights of ownership.
Be careful signing any deed, especially a quitclaim deed (the
deed that allows a property’s owner to relinquish all rights to
the property). Real estate con artists often use the quitclaim
deed to hijack property from unwary owners. They may hide
a single page quitclaim deed in a stack of papers, fooling the
owner into signing the document without knowing what
they’re signing. Then, they run down to the register of deeds
and file the deed, making themselves the new owners, so they
can take out bogus loans against the property.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
14

 Lien: A lien is a legal claim that a creditor holds against a
property in lieu of payment. Several parties can place a lien
on a property, including the lender who holds any first or
second mortgage, the county tax assessor (for unpaid taxes),
and contractors (if they financed the repairs or renovations).
As an investor, knowing who (if anyone) has a lien against a
property you’re purchasing and the monetary value of that
lien is important. All lien holders need to be paid in full upon
sale of the property. If the property has a lien against it that
the seller fails to disclose, you may become liable for paying it
when you take ownership of the property.
 Promissory note: Whenever you borrow money, you have to
sign a promissory note pledging to pay back the loan in full
according to terms of the loan, which always specifies a dead-
line for full payment. Think of a promissory note as an IOU (as
in “I owe you” this amount of money).
The promissory note is your pledge to pay back the loan. The
mortgage or deed of trust names the property as collateral in
the event that you default on the loan.
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 15
Who gets first dibs?
In the event of a foreclosure, certain liens take precedence over others, meaning
that when the property is sold at auction, certain lien holders are paid off first:
 Tax lien: The proceeds from the foreclosure sale pay off any unpaid property
taxes first.
 First mortgage: If any money from the proceeds of the sale remain, it pays off
the first mortgage or as much of the first mortgage as possible. This is also
referred to as a senior lien.
 Second mortgage: If the homeowner took out a second mortgage, any remain-
ing proceeds from the sale go toward paying it off. Any second (or third or
fourth) mortgages are also referred to as junior liens.
 Construction liens: If money still remains, it goes to the next lien holders in order
of precedence.
 Homeowners: After all the lien holders receive their cuts, the foreclosed-upon
homeowners get the remaining crumbs, which can actually be quite a chunk of
change if they had a lot of equity in the property.

Pointing out mortgage concepts
When you take out a loan, the lender requires something of value
(collateral) to make sure it has something valuable to sell and
recoup its investment if you default on the loan. This collateral is
officially presented in the form of a mortgage or deed of trust
depending on the jurisdiction:
 Mortgage: A mortgage is a contract between the lender and
borrower that gives the lender the right to foreclose on the
property in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan.
 Deed of trust: A deed of trust is a mortgage contract that
places control of the deed in the hands of a third party — a
trustee. The trustee has the power to foreclose on the prop-
erty in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan.
The mortgage market is large and complex, but it consists of two
main divisions: a primary and a secondary mortgage market.
 Primary: This is the market in which you do business. It con-
sists of financial institutions that lend you money.
 Secondary: This is the market where institutional lenders and
Wall Street investors converge. The primary lenders who actu-
ally loan money to homeowners and investors turn around
and sell the mortgages or deeds of trust to investors. This
gives the lenders more money to make available to borrowers.
Examining equity
Equity is the amount of money you’d have if you sold the property
today and paid off the balance due on the loan. More importantly,
as an investor, you can pull equity out of a property by borrowing
against it. This power enables you to put that equity to work for
you in other investments.
Thanks to the credit crisis in 2008 and 2009, the equity require-
ments to obtain financing are growing. Lenders are taking a closer
look at market values, especially in what they call declining areas —
areas showing a pattern of recently declining housing values. As an
investor, you should be doing the same thing. Be cautious when
calculating equity positions and profit margins.
Although we encourage investors to tap the power of equity, keep-
ing some equity in a property (especially the home you own) is a
good idea. Having equity to borrow against in the event of a finan-
cial setback may save you from foreclosure and bankruptcy.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
16

Looking at loan-to-value (LTV)
The loan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of the total loan amount to 
the value of the property. If you’re buying a $200,000 home with
$40,000 down and applying for a $160,000 loan, the LTV would be
$160,000 ÷ $200,000 = 80 percent
Generally speaking, lenders want to see lower LTVs for investment
properties than for homes because a lower LTV provides more of a
buffer to cover the increased risks inherent in investment proper-
ties. Check out Chapter 3 for more about calculating the LTV and
how lenders use this number to evaluate risk.
Distinguishing Investment 
and Home Financing
Your first real estate investment should be your own home. In fact,
if you don’t own your home, we advise you to put down this book
and pick up a copy of Home Buying For Dummies by Eric Tyson and
Ray Brown (Wiley) first. Owning your own home carries the least
risk and the most potential tax benefits while bringing you up to
speed on the basics of real estate investing and ownership.
After you’ve purchased a home, you should have a fairly good
understanding of the mortgage loan application and approval
process. (We provide a refresher course in Chapter 7.) However,
real estate financing differs quite a bit when you take on the role of
investor rather than homeowner. You and the lender take on more
risk. As a result, you can expect to pay more for the privilege of
borrowing money. In addition, your borrowing strategy is likely to
change. In the following sections, we cover these differences in
greater detail, so you know what to expect before diving in.
Paying a premium for riskier 
investment loans
When you invest in your own home, you literally have a vested
interest in making payments — if you don’t, you lose the roof over
your head. On the flip side, if you lose an investment property, it
may be painful, but it’s never that serious, and lenders are well
aware of the difference. For them, investment loans are riskier
propositions. To mitigate the risk, they generally
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 17

 Require a larger down payment.
 Demand a larger loan-to-value ratio. (See “Looking at loan to
value (LTV)” earlier in this chapter.)
 Charge more interest upfront in the form of points.
 Charge a higher interest rate.
 Require proof that you have reserves or liquid assets available
in case things don’t go as planned.
The actions that lenders take to mitigate the risks and the interest
rates and fees they charge vary greatly depending on the borrower
and the deal that’s on the table. Just make sure you have all the
documentation and figures ready when you meet with your lender
for the first time, as explained in Chapter 3.
Using quick cash to 
snag bargain prices
When you’re shopping for a mortgage to buy a home for your
family, you’re usually looking for a low-interest package, no or very
few points, and attractive terms. With investment properties, cash
flow trumps interest rate. In other words, access to cash is often
more important than the cost of the loan. To find out more about
the relative importance of cash flow and how to shop for loans
with the lowest interest rates and fees, see Chapter 6.
If the numbers work, what you pay in interest doesn’t matter.
Interest is just another expense. If you subtract all your expenses
and can still earn the profit you want, paying thousands of dollars
in interest over a relatively short period is acceptable.
Accounting for taxes on your 
capital gains (or losses)
When buying and selling a primary residence, you don’t have to
think too much about the tax ramifications of the transactions. In
the United States, a huge chunk of any profit you earn from the sale
is usually tax exempt — up to $250,000 if you own the home your-
self or double that if you and your spouse sell the home.
However, when you’re selling investment real estate, any profits
are subject to capital gains taxes. During the writing of this book,
profits from real estate investments were taxed as follows:
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
18

 Long-term capital gains: 15 percent if you hold the property
for at least a year and a day.
 Short-term capital gains: 35 percent if you sell the property in
fewer than 12 months from the date you purchased it.
 Income tax: If profits from investing in real estate are your
sole income, the IRS may consider it your job and tax your
profits as income, complete with an additional 15 percent in
self-employment tax.
We’re not tax experts. Consult a CPA who has experience dealing
with real estate investors for details on how the government is
going to tax your profits and for suggestions on how to reduce
your tax burden. Your measure of success isn’t how much you
gross but how much you net. By reducing your tax bill, you can sig-
nificantly increase your net gain.
Protecting your personal assets
Just like most things worth doing, real estate investing exposes
you to risk. Perhaps the biggest risk is that you’re working with
borrowed money from lenders who expect you to pay it back. If
you make a lousy investment decision or an investment goes belly-
up despite your best efforts, lenders are going to do everything
legally possible to collect their money.
You also face the ever-present risk of litigation — having a dis-
agreement with a buyer, seller, tenant, contractor, or someone else
that eventually leads to a costly lawsuit.
Eliminating risk isn’t possible, but you can take several measures
to lessen the risk, including operating through an LLC, transferring
personal assets to someone else, or having a qualified attorney
cover your back. Check out Chapter 2 for more details.
Exploring Common Sources 
of Investment Capital
You probably picked up this book because you want to start
investing in real estate, but you don’t know where to dig up the
cash to do your first deal. In the following sections, we show you
where to start digging.
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 19

Tapping your own cash reserves
If you’re single, or you and your significant other are on the same
page about this real estate investing thing, cracking into your nest
egg to finance your investments may be the quickest way to get
your fingers on some investment capital.
It’s also the riskiest option, because if anything goes wrong — you
get laid off or fired, become too ill to work, or encounter unex-
pected expenses — you have fewer reserves to keep you afloat. In
addition, limiting yourself to your own resources also limits your
purchase power — you have to buy houses in a lower price range
and may not have sufficient cash to properly renovate the property.
A great way to ruin a relationship is to bet the farm on big profits
without the knowledge and complete agreement of your spouse or
significant other. If your investment doesn’t pan out (and even if it
does), the other person may take offense at not being consulted.
Even with these caveats, many beginning investors have gotten
their start by financing their own ventures — partially or in full.
And you want to know about these resources if you need some
quick cash in a pinch.
Clearing out your bank accounts
Having a few thousand dollars socked away in a savings account is
always a good idea, just in case you run into a cash flow problem. If
that house you bought and fixed up is taking a few months longer
than expected to sell, your little nest egg can help cover the pay-
ments until you find a buyer.
Use your savings as a reserve, not as your main mode of financing.
Having some cash to fall back on can save you in a pinch.
Borrowing against the equity in your home
As your home’s value rises and you pay down the principal, you
build equity. You can often borrow against this equity by taking out
a home equity loan or line of credit and then use the money for
whatever you want, including purchasing other real estate. The
recent credit crisis has made it harder to find these loans, but
they’re still out there for well-qualified borrowers.
We don’t recommend that you cash out all the equity in your
home, but if you have a substantial amount of equity, cashing out a
portion of it can help you come up with a down payment or cover
the cost of repairs and renovations. (For more about home equity
loans and lines of credit, skip to Chapter 11.)

Financing investments through a self-directed IRA
More and more investors are choosing to set up self-directed IRAs
and other types of retirement accounts that enable them to invest
in real estate rather than in stocks and bonds. The reasoning: Real
estate often provides a better and sometimes even more secure
return on your investment.
With a self-directed IRA, you can buy and sell properties out of
your retirement account. Setting up a self-directed IRA, however, is
no simple matter. Typically, a trust company manages the money
and properties in the account, and all profits and losses from your
investments must stay in that account. Withdrawing money from
the account results in the same IRS penalties you have to pay if
you withdraw money from any type of retirement account.
Consult your financial advisor and accountant for details about
using a self-directed IRA to finance your real estate investments. If
a self-directed IRA isn’t an option, you may be able to borrow
money against your retirement account. Keep in mind, however,
that borrowing against your retirement savings places those sav-
ings at risk, as does any other investment.
Charging expenses on your credit cards
Maxing out your credit cards to purchase a car, clothes, electron-
ics, groceries, and other items that provide no return on your
investment is never a good idea. Using your credit cards to pur-
chase investment properties that offer a solid, relatively quick
return on your investment, however, can be a savvy (though risky)
financial move.
Consider credit cards a last resort to cover the costs of repairs and
renovations if financing is tight near the end of a project. With this
strategy, your investment activities can directly affect your per-
sonal finances, which increases your exposure to risk. For more
about this option, check out Chapter 11.
Borrowing from commercial lenders
One of the best ways to finance the purchase of investment proper-
ties is to meet with a qualified mortgage broker who can help you
find and evaluate various loan programs. These plans are often
your best deals — costing the least in upfront fees and interest.
For more about finding commercial lenders, check out Chapter 4. If
you’re investing in residential property, Chapter 5 reveals the vari-
ous residential loan programs to choose from. If you’re buying
commercial property, turn to Chapter 9 for guidance on choosing
the right loan program.
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 21

Don’t confuse “commercial property” with “commercial lender.” A
commercial property is any property that isn’t a one- to four-family
residential dwelling. A commercial lender is an institution (as
opposed to an individual) that loans money. In other words, you
can use a commercial lender to finance the purchase of residential
investment property.
Obtaining a hard money loan
When banks and other financial institutions turn down your
requests for investment capital (or you don’t have the time to con-
vince them that a deal is pure gold), consider borrowing money
from a hard money lender, as explained in Chapter 11.
One of the main advantages of a hard money lender is that the
person is likely to accept the property you’re buying as all the col-
lateral needed to secure the loan, so you don’t have to place your
home at risk.
Financing your purchase 
through the seller
Property owners who are eager to sell and don’t need all the cash
at once are often willing to finance the purchase themselves. This
tactic enables them to profit in two ways — by selling you the
property for more than they paid for it and collecting interest from
you. Seller financing take either of the following forms:
 Land contract: A land contract is like a mortgage, except the
seller acts as the bank.
 Lease option agreement: A lease option agreement is like a
rent-to-own deal — you lease the property for a specified
period, at the end of which time you have the option to buy it.
For more about seller financing, check out Chapter 12.
Taking on a partner
Whenever you don’t have something (like money, skills, time, or
talent) to accomplish a particular goal, you can acquire those 
skills, buy or hire them, or create a partnership with someone who
already has what you need. If you have something someone else
needs and they have what you need, you have what it takes to form
a mutually beneficial relationship. For details on how to partner
with someone who has the cash you need, check out Chapter 13.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
22

Choose a partner as carefully as you choose a spouse. Partnerships
often end when one person scams the other or disagreements arise
over who’s putting more into the projects and who’s getting more
out of them. Have your attorney write up a contract, complete with
a prenuptial type agreement stating how all the assets will be
divvied up in the event that you part company.
Prepping to Meet with a Lender
Walk into a bank empty-handed and explain to the loan officer that
you need a loan to start investing in real estate, and we can almost
guarantee that you’ll be laughed out the door. Before you even
think about meeting with a prospective lender, get all your ducks in
a row. Copy all the financial documents lenders are going to ask for
and construct a fairly detailed plan on how you’re going to profit
by investing in real estate. This section gives you an overview of
what you need to do before visiting your lender. Chapter 4 pro-
vides complete in-depth info.
Gathering paperwork and other info
Before approving your request for a loan, lenders want to know
whether you’re good for the money — how likely you are to make
the monthly payments and pay back the loan in full. For investors,
this means two things:
 You’re in pretty good financial shape right now and have a
fairly clean credit history.
 The property you’re planning to buy is more than worth the
money you’re borrowing to pay for it, and (if you’re going to
be renting out the property) it will generate sufficient income
to more than cover all your expenses along with the monthly
payments.
To verify your creditworthiness for yourself and be sure you have
all the documents and other information your lender requires, stuff
a folder full of a copy of each of the following items:
 Credit reports from all three credit reporting agencies
 A net worth statement (assets – liabilities = net worth)
 A debt ratio statement (ratio of what you owe to what 
you own)
 Last two months’ bank statements
 Last 30 days’ pay stubs
Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 23

 Last two years’ federal tax returns and schedules
 Statements of any business income
 Appraisal or comparative market analysis for the property
 Cash flow analysis of the property
 Loan-to-value ratio of the property
 Zoning information for the property’s location
 City and county records for the property
Crafting a business plan
Real estate investors often scoff at the idea of creating a business
plan — a detailed presentation that shows how an investor plans
to purchase a specific property and earn a profit from it. Investors
often just want to buy and sell and rent out property and make a
lot of money — that’s the plan. They don’t like to think of them-
selves as pencil-necked pencil pushers. If they feel in their gut that
a property is a solid investment, that’s good enough for them.
At least that’s the false image that many people have of investors.
The most successful investors, however, do the math. They crunch
the numbers. And if the numbers don’t work, they don’t do the deal.
Do your homework. Do a comparative market analysis of the prop-
erty to make sure it’s worth what you think it’s worth. If you’re
buying rental property, check the rental history of the property —
the owner’s tax records showing income and expenses. Craft a
business plan showing exactly how this property is going to be a
revenue generator.

Shielding Your Personal
Assets from Investment Risks
In This Chapter
 Grasping the need to cover your assets
 Investing as a corporation to reduce your exposure to risk
 Assigning ownership of certain assets to others
 Avoiding collateral and cross-collateral damage
 Dodging real estate and mortgage fraud
F
unny thing about lenders — when you borrow money from
them, they expect you to pay it back. To ensure repayment of
a loan, the lender usually requires that you sign a promissory note
and a mortgage or deed of trust. The promissory note is your per-
sonal promise to repay the loan in full. The mortgage or deed of
trust names certain property as collateral for the loan.
If you happen to default on the loan (fail to make payments as stip-
ulated), the lender has the right to foreclose (sell your property to
the highest bidder). If the lender can’t sell the property for at least
as much as you owe on it, it may be able to sue you for the differ-
ence (deficiency) in jurisdictions that allow deficiency judgments.
As an investor, you want to limit the assets that the lender has the
right to seize in lieu of payment. If you fail to make payments on a
loan you took out to purchase an investment property, for exam-
ple, you want to make sure that the bank can’t take possession of
the home you live in, other businesses you own, or other assets,
such as your car. To prevent the lender from going after personal
assets and other business assets as payment, you need to shield
those assets — keep them legally and financially separate from
your investment properties. In this chapter, you discover various
strategies for doing just that.

It’s a jungle out there. Fraud is more common in the real estate
industry than most professionals are willing to admit, so in this
chapter, we also show you how to protect yourself against becoming
a victim or unwitting accomplice to real estate and mortgage fraud.
Understanding Why You Need to
Protect Your Personal Assets
As an investor, you’re a small-business owner, but you’re also an
individual who may have a spouse and a family to support. You
probably have a home, a car, one or more personal bank accounts,
a retirement account, and other valuables that you’ve worked very
hard for a long time to accumulate. You want to build even more
wealth by investing in real estate, and you’re willing to take some
risks, but can you live with losing everything you now own?
The correct answer is (or should be) “no.” No, you shouldn’t risk
everything you now own to invest in real estate. Why? We can
think of two very good reasons:
 You don’t want to or have to risk everything. You can protect
some or all your assets from risk by following the advice we
offer in this chapter.
 If your investment goes belly up, you can recover much more
quickly and perhaps even pursue future investments by hold-
ing on to more of your current assets.
In any investment, you should try to limit your exposure (both
financially and emotionally) to the individual deal. You’re investing
your time and talent and perhaps a little of your own money. In
addition, you’re the one who’s taking on the burden of managing
the project, dealing with hassles, and worrying about whether your
investment is going to eventually turn a profit. All the lender is
doing is putting up the money, so let the lender step up to the plate
and take the financial risk. That’s the price it pays for being able to
do business with you.
Limiting Your Personal Liability 
by Forming an LLC
Businesses form corporations for any number of reasons, but one
of the primary reasons is to establish the business as a separate
entity. If, for example, you do business in your own name, you
become personally liable for anything that happens in the course
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
26

of doing business. If someone decides to sue you over something
related to your business, all your personal belongings are at stake.
By setting up a corporation, you essentially create a fall guy who
takes the blame if something terrible happens. A customer can sue
your corporation to the point of bankruptcy, and in most cases,
you can simply walk away with your home, your car, and your per-
sonal savings and belongings all intact.
One of the best and most popular corporate entities for real estate
investors is the limited liability company or LLC. By forming an LLC,
you limit your exposure to risk to the company, so it can fold with-
out negatively affecting your personal finances.
In the following sections, we provide guidelines on setting up an
LLC and managing your investments through it. For details about
creating and managing an LLC, check out Limited Liability
Companies For Dummies by Jennifer Reuting (Wiley).
Understanding the pros and cons
On its surface, an LLC appears to be the best of all possible busi-
ness entities, and in some ways it really is, but prior to taking the
plunge, consider its potential advantages and disadvantages. 
An LLC offers the following benefits:
 Generally requires less paperwork and fewer hassles: Small
business owners who form S-corps often get frustrated pre-
tending that they’re some huge corporation — filing all sorts
of forms, holding or pretending to hold corporate meetings,
and keeping a record of each meeting’s minutes. With an LLC,
you avoid most of that nonsense — at least the meetings and
the minutes.
 Provides greater protection: Operating as a sole proprietor-
ship leaves you completely vulnerable to lawsuits and other
legal claims against your personal assets. An LLC provides the
same sort of protection you can expect under the corporate
umbrella.
 Allows you to dodge the passive income bullet: If too much
of your income from real estate holdings is classified as pas-
sive, the IRS could convert your Sub-S into a C-corp (a regular
corporation), exposing you to double taxation. With an LLC,
you can do a pass-through, in which your real estate earnings
pass through the company and are treated as personal
income so that the company isn’t taxed separately, as well.
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 27

Although an LLC offers the protection of limited liability, it does
have a couple of its own limitations, as well:
 If a member of the LLC dies or goes bankrupt, the LLC is dis-
solved, whereas a corporation can continue to exist as long as
it has shareholders.
 All properties within the LLC are exposed to risks associated
with the other properties held in the same LLC. In other
words, someone trying to collect money for one of the LLC’s
properties can go after the other properties to collect pay-
ment. For this reason, limiting the number of properties held
in any one LLC is a good idea.
Setting up an LLC
Anyone with a free weekend, a computer, and an Internet connection
can set up an LLC (although we recommend that you use an attor-
ney). You download the forms, fill them out, and submit them to
your state commerce department, secretary of state, or bureau of
corporations. Although each state has slightly different procedures
to follow and forms to complete, you should be able to find all the
instructions and documents you need on your state’s Web site.
Go to your favorite online search engine and type in “corporation”
followed by the name of your state — for example, “corporation
Arizona” (without the quotation marks). This search should bring
up a link to the department in your state that handles LLCs and
corporations.
You can set up most LLCs on your own for very little expense and
paperwork, but we encourage you to consult with an attorney. A
savvy attorney can ensure you’ve set up your corporate shield in a
way that makes it less vulnerable to being pierced. You may also
want to hire an accountant to manage the finances for the com-
pany and ensure that any taxes that come due are paid on time.
The choice of which state you form your corporation in is of
utmost importance, especially in terms of how you’re taxed.
Delaware, for example, is very corporation-friendly, which is why
you see so many financial institutions, especially credit card com-
panies, centered in Delaware. Discuss the options with your
accountant and attorney.
Taking and securing title to real estate
When you have an LLC in place, perform all business transactions
in the name of the LLC rather than in your own name. Whether
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
28

you’re taking out a loan, signing a purchase agreement, or putting
your John Hancock on closing papers, make sure your LLC is listed
as the responsible party and that you’re signing as a representative
of the company.
Accomplishing this task is fairly easy on your part because other
people are usually in charge of drawing up the paperwork. All you
need to do is instruct the person (real estate agent, closing agent,
loan officer, or whoever is handling the paperwork) to prepare it in
the name of the LLC.
Unfortunately, on conventional loans with conventional lenders for
typical one- to four-family dwellings, getting a loan in the name of
the LLC is nearly impossible, but you can still have the LLC hold the
property, providing some protection from personal liability. You
have an easier time taking loans out in the name of the LLC when
purchasing larger properties (5+ units) and commercial deals.
If you can’t take title in the name of your LLC, move the property
into the LLC as soon as practical. You can do this by using a quit-
claim deed — typically a one-page legal document that enables you
to deed the property to another individual or business entity. You
simply sign the quitclaim deed, specifying that the LLC is the new
deed holder, and then file the quitclaim deed with your county’s
register of deeds. Your attorney can supply you with a quitclaim
deed that’s valid in your county.
Follow your attorney’s advice carefully, because this strategy can
trigger a due-on-sale clause, in which case you would need to pay
back the loan in full immediately. The IRS allows investors to trans-
fer real estate for estate-planning purposes, so you’re in the clear
as long as you follow the rules.
Some LLCs choose to perform certain transactions under an
assumed name — a name that differs from that of the company. We
strongly discourage the use of assumed names in real estate trans-
actions, because they provide little, if any, protection for you.
Always transact your investment business under the LLC’s name.
Eyeing Sub-S corporations 
and partnerships
Although we recommend LLCs for most investors, a Subchapter S
corporation (or Sub-S for short) is a viable alternative. A Sub-S is
an actual corporation (as opposed to a company) that chooses not
to pay taxes on earnings but instead have those earnings pass
through to the shareholders so they pay taxes on them. It’s
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 29

another way of dodging the double-taxation bullet (taxing the cor-
poration as well as the individual shareholders). 
A Sub-S can also provide you with a great measure of protection
and allow for other deductions and a wider variety of activities
than are possible under an LLC. For example, a Sub-S allows you to
partner with other business entities in addition to individuals.
If you plan on partnering up with another investor, you need to for-
malize the relationship by forming a partnership, as we discuss in
Chapter 13. A partnership is simply a business entity in which the
members agree to work toward a common goal. You need to have a
written agreement in place that stipulates how the partnership
functions, who’s responsible for what, and how assets are to be
divided should the partnership dissolve. The partnership itself,
however, provides you with little or no protection. You still need to
set up a corporation or an LLC for protecting your personal assets
and those of your partner(s).
Transferring Personal 
Assets via Trusts
As an investor, you’re a business owner, and most responsible
business owners keep their business and personal finances sepa-
rate. You can be sued by anyone at any time, and you want to pro-
tect your family and personal assets as best as possible. An
excellent way to accomplish this is to place your personal assets
under someone else’s name or into a separate entity — a trust.
Consider the following options:
 Transfer personal assets to your spouse, one of your children,
another relative, or a designated third-party administrator
such as an attorney or financial planner.
 Shift your assets into a trust — a legal device you as an indi-
vidual place your assets in for the benefit of others, such as
your family.
Investors often spend a great deal of time and effort building
wealth only to see the fruits of their efforts chipped away by unjus-
tified lawsuits and taxes. By holding your assets in an estate or
trust, you not only protect them against legal claims, but you can
also reap substantial tax benefits. Sophisticated investors often
use multiple business entities (including LLCs and other corporate
structures) to manage their assets and protect them from a variety
of risks. As you acquire more properties, consider employing a
similar strategy. For more about estate planning, check out Estate
Planning For Dummies by Jordan Simon and Brian Caverly (Wiley).
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
30

In the following sections, we address the advantages and disadvan-
tages of placing your assets in someone else’s name and assist you
in deciding which option is best for you.
Weighing the pros and cons of owning
property in another’s name
Investors and business owners often protect assets by placing
them in the name of a spouse or other relative. Before you make
this move, however, you need to have a firm grasp of the pros and
cons to protect the property.
Some investors hold some investments in their own names, and
some in the name of their spouses. This strategy increases the
number of properties you can finance (by getting around Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac limits on the number of residential proper-
ties/mortgages you can hold) and also enables you to diversify
your assets and limit liabilities.
A real estate investor, for example, may choose to have her spouse
listed as the sole owner of their home, car, and other big-ticket
assets and then take out loans and the title to investment proper-
ties in her own name only. If she defaults on a loan, she can lose
the investment property, but the family home and car are safe.
So, what’s the catch? Placing assets in someone else’s name can
increase your exposure to several risks:
 You lose some control over those assets. If all your personal
assets are listed in your husband’s name only, for example, a
divorce may leave you at a severe disadvantage.
 You may affect your kids’ future financial aid. If you own
property in the name of your children, the value of that 
property can influence the financial aid calculations should
your children decide to attend college and require financial
assistance.
 You may encounter tax consequences. Putting assets in the
names of your children may also trigger gift tax requirements
or estate tax issues.
 You’re at the mercy of that person’s legal issues. If the
holder of your assets becomes disabled or runs into his own
liability issues, your assets can get tied up for a long time in
the legal wrangling. Bankruptcy, insolvency, or even death
(and the subsequent probate) can turn the best of plans into a
financial fiasco.
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 31

Placing assets in someone else’s name can be a bit of a hassle, but
it usually doesn’t cost all that much. For example, you can head
down to the bureau of motor vehicles and change the name on the
title for any vehicles you own for a small fee. Likewise, you can use
a quitclaim deed to assign ownership of a property for a small
recording fee. Before you do, however, consult your attorney or
accountant to find out about all the ramifications of transferring
ownership of your properties because the laws and procedures
vary from state to state.
Gaining asset and tax protection
with an irrevocable trust
Trusts are the most versatile tool for transferring title of assets
without tax implications or increased risk, but they have some lim-
itations. We encourage you to discuss your situation with a quali-
fied estate planner who can assist you in weighing the potential
benefits and drawbacks of different options and then set up the
trust for you.
Trusts come in two flavors — revocable and irrevocable. A revoca-
ble trust is one you can change or terminate during your lifetime.
An irrevocable trust is one that you can’t change or dissolve — as
grantor (creator of the trust), you no longer own the assets held in
trust. The trust does. An irrevocable trust benefits you in two
important ways:
 Because you no longer own the assets, they’re protected
against any legal actions taken against you.
 The property and its appreciation are outside of your taxable
estate, allowing you to avoid paying estate taxes on the value
of your holdings.
Both revocable and irrevocable trusts protect assets from probate,
but only irrevocable trusts can eliminate estate taxes.
The ultimate way to protect assets is to hold them in an offshore
asset protection trust, but we’re not advising that you do that. The
next best thing is to have your assets owned by a Sub-S or LLC and
then have the shares of the corporation owned by an irrevocable
trust — this is the fortress of U.S. asset protection. The IRS frowns
upon any sort of tax optimization scheme, particularly the offshore
variety, so before employing any such scheme, consult a tax 
attorney.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
32

Considering real estate investment
trusts (REITs)
Real estate investment trusts (or REITs for short) give small
investors a way to pool their assets and own investment real estate
as a group. REITs offer investors three significant benefits:
 Investors can diversify their real estate holdings by owning
pieces of multiple properties. Instead of purchasing a
$200,000 property, for example, a small investor can own a
$10,000 share in 20 properties, spreading the risk.
 Small investors can afford to buy into higher-end real
estate. REITs allow minor league investors to play a smaller
role in the major leagues, because it costs less to buy in.
 REITs simplify the transfer of ownership to different
investors. Instead of selling the property, you simply transfer
shares.
If you have an LLC with 100 or more investors, consult your attor-
ney for assistance in setting up a REIT, to ensure that it meets all
the requirements, including the following:
 Your REIT must have at least 100 shareholders. Why 100?
That’s just one of the rules.
 You must distribute at least 90 percent of your REIT’s taxable
income. In other words, at least 90 percent of the profits earned
by the assets in the REIT must flow through to shareholders.
 Ninety five percent of your REIT’s income must come from
financial investments (including real estate, securities, and
annuities), with 75 percent of that total coming from real estate
(net profit from sale of assets, rent/lease payments, and so on).
Staying Away from Promissory
Notes with Recourse Clauses
Promissory note is a fancy term for an IOU. Whenever you borrow
money, the lender almost always requires that you sign a promis-
sory note promising to pay back the money under a set of specific
conditions, including the term (amount of time you have to pay the
loan in full), interest rate, principal (total amount you borrowed),
and payment amount of each scheduled payment.
Promissory notes usually include a recourse clause stipulating that
the person signing for the loan is pledging individual assets as
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 33

additional collateral to secure the loan. If the loan goes bad, the
lender can then come after the borrower’s personal assets to
recoup any losses.
In the following sections, we explain nonrecourse loans (the most
desirable option), discuss what you need to do if your contract has
a recourse clause, and point out the risks involved in cross-collater-
alized loans — loans that enable the lender to lay claim to prop-
erty other than the property the loan was used to purchase.
Opting for a nonrecourse loan
If you’re trying to borrow money for a potentially lucrative invest-
ment, a recourse loan may be your only option, but in most cases,
you want a loan that places only the property you’re financing at
risk — a nonrecourse loan.
Nonrecourse means that the property stands on its own. Fail to
make your payments, and all you stand to lose is the property you
borrowed the money to buy . . . and your pride. Borrowers typi-
cally use nonrecourse loans for financing the purchase of larger
commercial-type properties, where the lender understands that
the real value is in the property and the income it generates. If a
$15 million loan on a hotel goes bad, the lender knows he can’t
shake enough quarters and nickels out of you to pay it back.
Instead, he can get the money out of the property.
In some cases, lenders allow you to buy into a nonrecourse clause
by paying a higher interest rate or agreeing to other terms that are
more favorable to the lender. It never hurts to ask, but on smaller
properties, you can usually count on having to agree to some sort
of recourse clause. (See the next section for more on how to nego-
tiate this recourse clause.)
Any type of fraud, misrepresentation, or misappropriation of funds
in respect to the loan or the property — such as claiming that the
building generates more rental income than it really does — can
void the nonrecourse clause and give the lender the right to come
after your personal assets.
Negotiating the recourse clause
Although we suggest you go the nonrecourse route as often as pos-
sible, some contracts require a recourse clause. Fortunately, this
clause is usually negotiable. A lender typically doesn’t remove it
entirely, but you may be able to negotiate a recourse clause that
limits your liability. Ask your loan officer or broker whether any
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
34

options are available. Following are some areas that may be open
for negotiation:
 Property limitations: You may limit the recourse, for exam-
ple, to other real estate holdings in your LLC, thus protecting
your personal residence and other assets.
 Time limitations: You may be able to place a time limitation
on your liability; for example, if you make payments on time
for five years, your personal liability is released.
 Partial recourse: This provision limits your liability to a cer-
tain percentage of the loan or a certain amount (less than the
full amount). Partial recourse can also limit the lender’s abil-
ity to collect only under certain conditions.
Almost every residential loan (for one- to four-family investment
property) requires personal recourse. Just make sure you under-
stand the limitations and options. When signing a promissory note,
make sure that the recourse clause is limited to the assets you’re
willing to put at risk.
Avoiding cross-collateralization
To protect their money, lenders like to know that you have plenty
of collateral — anything of value that they can take from you and
sell to get their money back in the event you’re unable or unwilling
to pay back the loan. When the housing market is thriving and
property values are on the rise, lenders tend to accept the prop-
erty you’re financing as collateral on the loan. If you don’t make
your payments, they can foreclose, sell the property, and get back
all or nearly all their money.
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 35
Your recourse to recourse loans
I (Chip) once had 16 doctors who went in together on a commercial building as an
investment. The bank wanted a full recourse loan on each of them, which would
have given them a total of 1600 percent coverage on the loan. We negotiated for a
10 percent personal recourse on each investor, which still provided the lender with
160 percent coverage. We were also able to eliminate personal liability after five
years of satisfactory payments.
The moral of this story is this: Don’t accept what the lender offers as a final offer. As
long as you’re a serious investor with a solid plan in place, you can usually negoti-
ate more attractive terms with the lender.

On riskier investments — when property values are declining or
the property’s value is close to the amount being borrowed or a
large loan is being taken out to purchase multiple properties — 
the lender may want to cross-collateralize the loan. With cross-
collateralization, two or more properties act as collateral for a
single loan. If you fail to make payments on the loan, the lender 
can foreclose on other properties to collect the amount due.
For the investor, cross-collateralization exposes other properties to
the liabilities of one. Stay away from these types of loans if at all
possible. You can’t always avoid cross-collateralization, but we
encourage you to at least try. Otherwise, you may lose a good
income property just because one of your other properties is a dog.
Steering Clear of Real Estate 
and Mortgage Fraud
Wherever you find money, you find crooks — con artists deter-
mined to score some quick cash. As a real estate investor, you’re
vulnerable to real estate and mortgage fraud in any or all of the fol-
lowing three ways: as a target, as a perpetrator, or as an unwitting
accomplice. And all these roles can ultimately undermine your
long-term success, not to mention your reputation.

Cross-collateralization nightmare
Several years ago, I (Chip) had a friend who had a great idea for a retail clothing
store. Couldn’t lose, or so he thought. Unfortunately, his overconfidence led him to
be careless in borrowing money for his new venture. He allowed the loan he
secured to buy the building to be cross-collateralized with the store’s inventory and
many of his personal assets.
A sharp downturn in the market transformed his dreams to dust in a mere 18 months,
but the worst was yet to come: The lender not only foreclosed on the building and
took his inventory but also went after his home, car, boat, and retirement fund. The
financial strain eventually ended his marriage.
Any investment that’s worth pursuing usually involves some risk, but going all in
when you don’t really have to is folly. By avoiding the cross-collateralization trap,
you limit your risk to the new investment.
No investment is a sure thing. Protect yourself from unforeseen and unfortunate
circumstances as much as possible.

In the following sections, we describe the main types of real estate
and mortgage fraud, to empower you to steer clear of scams and
schemes that can get you into trouble.
Ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it. Unfortunately,
ignorance is as rampant as fraud in the real estate industry. Many
real estate professionals may try to convince you that something
illegal is okay because everybody does it or because these are “vic-
timless crimes.” However, as we’ve seen from the mortgage melt-
down beginning in 2008, homeowners and investors ultimately pay
the price. For more about real estate and mortgage fraud, check
out Protect Yourself from Real Estate and Mortgage Fraud: Preserving
the American Dream of Homeownership by Ralph R. Roberts and
Rachel Dollar (Kaplan Publishing).
Telling the truth on your application
A huge percentage of real estate and mortgage fraud could be elim-
inated if everyone in the industry, including investors, would work
together to ensure that all the information on loan applications is
complete and accurate.
Buyers and those who assist them often think that accuracy is
optional, but the loan application, the 1003 (commonly referred to
as a ten-oh-three, or officially as the Uniform Residential Loan
Application), clearly states, just above the space for your signa-
ture, the following:
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 37
Refusing to play a role in fraud for housing
Fraud for housing used to be the most common type of real estate and mortgage
fraud and the most “harmless” (although still illegal). It consists of lying on a loan
application so you can purchase a home to live in – as opposed to “fraud for profit,”
in which you’re committing fraud to obtain money.
When you’re acting as an investor, you’re at a pretty low risk of becoming a perpe-
trator of fraud for housing because you’re not buying the property to live in it.
However, you may be at risk for becoming an accomplice if you’re trying to sell a
property to buyers who are having trouble qualifying for a mortgage loan.
If prospective buyers are having trouble qualifying for a loan to buy the property
you’re selling, they may just not be able to afford the payments. Don’t try to “help”
them by encouraging them to lie on their loan application or by referring them to a
loan officer who’s known for bending the rules.

I/We fully understand that it is a federal crime punishable by fine
or imprisonment, or both, to knowingly make any false state-
ments concerning any of the above facts as applicable under the
provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, et seq.
What constitutes a false statement? Here’s a list of what may be
considered false:
 Stating or providing false records that you’re employed some-
where you’re not.
 Stating or providing false records of income.
 Providing false identification.
 Boosting your credit score by piggybacking on someone else’s
better credit.
 Falsifying ownership of assets, either by stating that you own
items you don’t or by renting assets. (Some disreputable com-
panies allow you to rent assets, so you appear to own more
assets than you really do.)
 Failing to disclose a silent second. A silent second is a separate
mortgage typically taken out to cover the down payment. As
we discuss in Chapter 14, taking out a second mortgage to
finance the down payment is okay, but not disclosing it is ille-
gal. It creates the false impression that you’re more financially
secure than you really are.
Dodging predatory lenders
Although lenders are often the victims of mortgage fraud, they may
also be guilty of committing fraud and are even more frequently
guilty of lending practices that prey on uninformed borrowers.
Whenever you’re applying for a loan, keep one hand on your wallet
and one eye out for the following questionable and perhaps illegal
lending practices:
 Charging you higher-than-normal loan origination fees (includ-
ing points).
 Encouraging you to bend the truth on a loan application, so
you can qualify for a loan you would otherwise not qualify for.
 Having you sign a blank loan application and then filling in the
details for you later.
 Refinancing your mortgage repeatedly within a short period of
time.
 Selling you a high-cost, high-interest loan when you would
qualify for a low-cost, low-interest loan.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
38

 Adding products or services such as credit life insurance to a
loan without adequately informing you about the need or cost
of these products or services. Watch out for hidden (undis-
closed) fees.
 Selling you products or services that are nonexistent or offer
no benefit.
 Convincing you to borrow more than you can reasonably
afford to pay back.
 Pressuring you to accept high-risk loans, such as balloon-
payment loans, interest-only mortgages, subprime or
adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), and loans with high 
prepayment penalties.
 Selling high-interest loans based on ethnicity or nationality
rather than your credit history and financial situation.
Always obtain three or more quotes from different companies
before choosing a loan and compare the quotes carefully (see
Chapter 6 for details). Doing so enables you to see any hidden loan
costs more clearly. When applying for and closing on a loan, read
the documents carefully to make sure the information is accurate
and complete.
Saying “no” to inflated appraisals
One of the main instruments that real estate con artists use to ply
their trade is the inflated appraisal — a document showing that a
property is worth significantly more than its true market value. By
obtaining an inflated appraisal (forging one or paying off a crooked
appraiser), the con artist can create equity in a property where
none exists.
As an investor, never try to sway the opinion of an appraiser or
allow a loan officer, real estate agent, or anyone else to convince
you to go along with a deal that involves an inflated appraisal.
Also, be careful about overpaying for a property whose value has
been artificially boosted by inflated appraisals. You can protect
yourself by ordering your own independent appraisal before pur-
chasing a property. Find an appraiser in the area who has a solid
gold reputation and plenty of experience in the market you’re
buying into. Don’t let the seller or seller’s agent recommend an
appraiser. You pay a few hundred dollars for your own appraisal,
but it can save you from making a mistake costing tens or even
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
We also recommend against using online appraisals or computer-
ized valuation models. You want a real live person, a qualified
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 39

appraiser who knows the local market, to physically inspect the
property and provide you with an educated estimate of its market
value. There’s really no substitute.
Turning your back on cash-
back-at-closing schemes
One of the most prevalent forms of fraud, particularly when the
market is down, consists of providing the buyer with cash back at
closing. The buyer agrees to pay more for the property than it’s
worth and obtains an inflated appraisal showing that the property
is actually worth the purchase price. The seller agrees to raise the
asking price and kick back the excess money to the buyer at clos-
ing. Many people think these arrangements are okay, but don’t be
fooled — cash back at closing is illegal. Protect yourself:
 Don’t offer buyers cash back at closing or any other “perks”
that the lender is actually financing, including “free” furniture,
a cruise, upgrades, and so on.
 Don’t accept cash back at closing, even if it comes in some
other form, such as “free” furniture, upgrades, rebates,
refunds, or anything else that’s actually being paid out of the
loan amount.
Avoiding illegal flipping
Flipping houses, as described in Flipping Houses For Dummies, is
perfectly legal. You buy a house below market value, fix it up, and
then sell it for a profit. However, another type of flipping is clearly
illegal. It consists of buying a property, typically a dilapidated
house, at well below market value, doing a few cosmetic repairs to
make it look nice, and then selling it for much more than its true
market value.
As an investor, avoid illegal flipping. In addition to breaking the
law, this type of flipping ruins your long-term success. Illegal flip-
pers may score some quick cash, but they quickly ruin their repu-
tations and often end up in legal trouble. It’s not worth it.
To avoid becoming the victim of an illegal flip, always check the
recent sales prices of similar homes in the same neighborhood to
make sure the asking price of the property you’re about to pur-
chase is realistic. Make sure you’re the one choosing the home
inspector and the appraiser. If the seller offers to handle this for
you, politely decline the offer.

Defending yourself against 
chunking schemes
Real estate investors often become the targets of con artists
through what is commonly referred to as a chunking scheme. The
con artist dangles a quick-cash, no-hassle investment opportunity
in front of the eager investor and offers to take care of all the
details. The investor only has to put up the cash or sign the papers
for the loan that to finance the deal.
The organizer promises to place renters, collect the rent, make the
mortgage payments, and so on, and tells the investor that the rental
payments will cover the mortgage and maybe even earn a little
extra cash each month. The investor can sell the property at any
time and profit from it because the property is sure to appreciate.
The truth behind the deal is that the properties are usually over-
valued, the renters don’t exist, and the con artist never intends to
make the mortgage payments. Investors are left with dilapidated
homes, unpaid mortgages, and destroyed credit.
The best way to avoid getting sucked in by a chunking scheme is to
plug your ears when you hear someone pitching a no-risk, no-
hassle way to earning riches in real estate. Quite frankly, such
deals don’t exist. Do your homework. Visit the property and
inspect it with your own two eyes. Oversee the management of the
property. Don’t let someone else “handle all the details” because
they probably intend to handle you out of your money.
Refusing a builder bailout
Builders who become overextended may try to dig themselves out
of a financial hole by selling homes (or whatever they’re building)
before completion to unsuspecting buyers. In some cases, the
builder eventually completes the project. In other cases, he may
take the cash and leave the buyer with an unfinished building or
even a vacant lot.
When banks finance new construction (see Chapter 9), they don’t
give the builder all the money at once. They set up an account that
the builder draws from during the building process. The bank
wants to make sure the project is completed, so it ties the cash
draws to success and to certain milestones. When those mile-
stones are completed, the bank can then free up the money to pay
for the supplies and services. For example, if the rough lumber
needed for a project costs $28,000, the bank would give the builder
Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 41

a draw for $28,000, which would then flow to the lumber company
after the framing was complete. The lumber company would then
sign a waiver of lien, acknowledging payment and freeing up its
claim to the property.
When a builder becomes strapped for cash, he may try to get the
money sooner by employing any of the following strategies:
 Falsifying inspection reports
 Submitting fake certifications of work performed
 Fooling the inspectors by removing items from some buildings
and installing them in others to make it appear as though
progress is being made
 Selling an incomplete property to the buyer
The best way to avoid builder bailout scams is to choose a rep-
utable builder and refuse to close on the deal until you have the
building thoroughly inspected by a professional inspector of your
choosing.
Acting with integrity: 
The golden rule
Far too many investors succumb to the temptation to commit
fraud because they’re in a hurry to make a quick buck. All these
“investors” eventually fail because they tarnish their own reputa-
tions and damage the very industry that puts money in their 
pockets.
The best way to achieve long-term success as a real estate investor
is to make a commitment to follow the golden rule — treat others
as you would want to be treated. You can still earn a handsome
profit in real estate by purchasing properties legitimately and set-
ting a fair price when you sell. You don’t have to break or bend the
laws to be successful. You just need to do your homework.

L
enders aren’t exactly tripping over themselves to lend money,
especially in the recent credit debacles of the mid-2000s. They
want to know who they’re lending it to, for what, and how and
when they’re going to get paid back. They usually operate conserv-
atively, weighing the risks before quoting you a price. If they see
your venture as too risky, they may reject your loan application
outright. If they believe you’re in a strong position to pay back the
loan in full, they may offer you financing at lower interest rates to
win your business. If they see you as a moderate risk, you may
receive financing at higher rates.
In any event, the lender wants to see how you look on paper — the
value of what you own, how much you owe, how much you earn,
your credit history, and so on. Before you even think about applying
for a loan, gather all the documents and information that lenders are
likely to request. This chapter leads you through the process.
Examining Your Credit Reports
Good credit is gold. Without it, you have access to your money
only. With it, you can put other people’s money to work for you.
Whenever you apply for a loan, the lending institution performs a
credit check — a background check to make sure that you’re not up

to your gills in debt, that your income covers expenses, and that
you pay your bills on time. They examine your credit history (doc-
umented by the three major credit reporting agencies), bank state-
ments, pay stubs, W-2s, tax forms, and other financial records.
To ensure success at obtaining loans, become proactive in ensuring
your credit history remains unblemished. Check your credit report
every three months or so, correct any errors, and take steps to
improve your credit rating, as instructed in the following sections.
No irregularity is too small to correct. (Checking your own credit
report doesn’t negatively affect your credit score as can too many
credit inquiries from prospective creditors. Check your credit history
regularly, but keep loan and credit card applications to a minimum.)
The following sections show you how to obtain, review, and cor-
rect your credit report. We also offer suggestions on how to
improve your credit score.
Obtaining free copies of your reports
As of September 1, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) man-
dated each of the three major credit reporting companies provide
you with a free credit report once every 12 months (a total of three
free credit reports per year). These three major national credit
reporting bureaus contain slightly different information about your
credit history, or what’s called a credit report or credit profile.
To obtain your free credit report, do one of the following:
 Submit your request online at
www.annualcreditreport.com.
 Phone in your request by calling toll-free 877-322-8228.
 Download the Annual Credit Report Request Form from www.
annualcreditreport.com (click the link to request your
report through the mail), fill it out, and mail it to Annual
Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA
30348-5281.
Some banks offer free credit reports, so consider checking with
your bank or credit union, too.
If you already obtained your three free credit reports this year 
and want something more recent, you can order a credit report for
less than ten bucks from any of the following three credit report
agencies:
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
44

 Equifax: 800-685-1111 or online at www.equifax.com.
 Experian: 888-397-3742 or online at www.experian.com.
 TransUnion: 800-916-8800 or online at www.transunion.com.
Financial institutions may not file reports with all three agencies.
To obtain a complete credit history, order a three-in-one report
that contains data from all three agencies. All three agencies offer
these three-in-one reports.
Checking your credit score
To give your credit rating an air of objectivity, credit reporting
agencies often assign you a credit score that ranges roughly
between 300 (you never paid a bill in your life) and 900 (you
borrow often, always pay your bills on time, and don’t carry any
huge balances on your credit cards). A “good” credit score is 700
or above. A “great” credit score is anything higher than 780.
Your credit score determines not only whether you qualify for a loan
but also how much you’re qualified to borrow and at what interest
rate. A high credit score enables you to borrow more and pay less
interest on it. A high score can also lower your home and auto insur-
ance rates so keeping a close eye on your score is important.
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 45
Credit score stats
Credit reporting agencies rely on one or more statistical models to determine your
credit score. One of the most popular models is the Fair Isaac Company (FICO) rating
system. The credit company assigns numerical values to particular pieces of data
in your credit history, such as the length of your credit history and the various types
of interest you’re paying. They then plug these numbers into the statistical model,
which spits out your credit score. It’s basically a numbers game that weighs the
data on your credit report in the following manner:
 35 percent of the score is based on payment history
 30 percent is based on outstanding debt or how much you currently owe
 15 percent is based on the length of your credit history or how long you’ve been
borrowing
 10 percent is based on recent inquiries on your report (whenever a lending insti-
tution requests a report)
 10 percent is based on the types of credit, such as mortgage or credit card interest

Although the law requires each credit agency to supply you with
one report annually, it doesn’t require them to provide your credit
score. When you’re getting your free report, you can choose to pay
extra to include your credit score.
Inspecting your report for problems
When you receive your credit report, inspect it carefully for the 
following red flags:
 Names that are the same as or similar to yours, but aren’t you.
 Relative with the same name; for example, a father (Senior) if
you’re Junior.
 Addresses of places you’ve never lived.
 Aliases you’ve never used, which may indicate that someone
else is using your Social Security Number or the credit report-
ing agency has mixed someone else’s data into yours.
 Multiple Social Security Numbers, flagging the possibility that
information for someone with the same name has made it into
your credit report.
 Wrong date of birth (DOB).
 Credit cards you don’t have.
 Loans you haven’t taken out.
 Records of unpaid bills that you either know you paid or have
good reason for not paying.
 Records of delinquent payments that weren’t delinquent or
you have a good excuse for not paying on time.
 Inquiries from companies with whom you’ve never done busi-
ness. (When you apply for a loan, the lender typically runs an
inquiry on your credit report, and that shows up on the report.)
An address of a place you’ve never lived or records of accounts,
loans, and credit cards you never had may be a sign that some-
body has stolen your identity. Yikes! Contact the credit reporting
company immediately and request that a fraud alert be placed on
your credit report. For tips on protecting yourself against identity
theft and recovering from it, check out Preventing Identity Theft For
Dummies by Michael J. Arata, Jr. (Wiley).

Repairing your credit and 
boosting your score
If you have a credit score of 700 or higher, pat yourself on the back.
You’re above average and certainly qualified to borrow big bucks
at the lowest available rates. Anything below about 680 sounds the
warning sirens that you need to dispute errors on your report or
repair your credit as quickly as possible. This number is the point
at which lending institutions get out their magnifying glasses and
begin raising rates and denying credit.
If your credit rating dips below 700, take steps to improve it, such
as the following:
 Dispute any erroneous items on your credit report.
Disputing a claim doesn’t always result in a correction, but
you can add a paragraph to your report explaining your side
of the story.
 Apply for fewer loans and credit cards. When you apply for a
loan or credit card, the lending institution typically orders an
inquiry that shows up on your credit report. Evidence that
you’re applying for several loans or credit cards in a short
period of time can make you appear financially desperate.
 Pay off your credit card balances, if possible, or at least
enough so the balance is 50 percent or below your available
credit limit. Doing so shows that your credit isn’t maxed out.
Paying off high-interest credit card balances is always a good idea,
but don’t start consolidating loans and closing out accounts. Having
four open accounts with a balance of $1,000 each on a $5,000 credit
limit looks better than one account with a credit limit of $5,000 and a
$4,000 balance. Why? Because of something called credit utilization —
your total debt relative to the amount of credit available to you.
Keeping your credit utilization below 80 percent (preferably below
60 percent) improves your score.
Avoid credit enhancement companies on the Web that claim to
provide seasoned credit within 90 days. Law enforcement authori-
ties are shutting down these sites on a regular basis. Legitimate
credit counselors can help you repair your damaged credit, but it
takes some work and a little belt-tightening. Quick fixes are typi-
cally fraudulent fixes. For additional tips on boosting your credit
score, check out Credit Repair Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by
Steve Bucci (Wiley).

Avoiding mistakes that can 
sabotage your loan approval
After you apply for a loan, resist the urge to make any life-changing
decisions that negatively affect your current financial status. Major
changes can undermine your efforts to secure a loan, so follow
these sage do’s and don’ts:
 Do stay married: Divorce drains your emotions, energy, and
finances. It cuts your assets in half and increases your liabili-
ties, obliterating your chances of securing a loan.
 Don’t apply for other loans or credit cards: Any last-minute
inquiries that pop up on your credit report can be a red flag
that cautions prospective lenders.
 Do avoid buying big-ticket items: Buying an expensive vehi-
cle can sink a deal. If you must have the vehicle, buy, fix, and
sell the investment property first, and then purchase the vehi-
cle with your profit.
 Don’t make any major purchases on credit: This advice goes
for a car, furniture, health club membership, big-screen TV,
and any other purchase that can throw off your debt-to-
income ratio (see “Calculating your debt ratio” later in this
chapter).
 Don’t cosign for any loans: No matter what your relationship
with the borrower is (or how badly your son, daughter, or
long-lost uncle needs the money), don’t cosign a loan. Doing
so exposes your credit history to potential blemishes when
others fail to make their payments.
 Don’t withdraw or move substantial amounts of cash: If a
prospective lender looks at an account expecting to see $10,000,
and it shows a $50 balance, you have some explaining to do.
 Do pay your bills on time: Records of unpaid bills and delin-
quent payments can get back to prospective lenders. If you
have a stack of unpaid bills, pay them now. If a bill is due on
the 1st and you pay it on the 15th, you can avoid the late fee.
Paying it before the 30th typically keeps the late payment off
your credit report. But any bill payment after the due date is
considered late and qualifies as slow pay, which lenders can
figure into their formula assuming they know about it.
If your financial situation changes between the application and the
time of closing, you’re legally obligated to inform the loan officer
and lender of the change.

Chasing Down Vital Paperwork
You can approach a loan application in one of two ways: Either
show up with all the paperwork, facts, and figures in hand or con-
sult with a lender first and find out what she needs. The first
approach is best, because it demonstrates to lenders that you’re
well organized and are committed to providing them with every-
thing they need to do their job.
However, in order to come prepared to your lender, you must know
which paperwork you need for the meeting. In the following sec-
tions, we reveal the information and documentation most lenders
are going to require to process your loan application.
Delving into your personal 
financial information
Unless you plan to borrow money solely against business assets,
lenders are going to want to know everything about your personal
finances — the value of everything you own, the total you already
owe on other loans and credit cards, your monthly and annual
income, monthly bills, and so on. And they’ll want documentation
to back up all those figures.
The following sections show you how to calculate some of these
important figures, including your net worth and debt ratio, and list
the documentation required to prove the amount of cash you have
and the monthly and annual income you earn.
Calculating your net worth
Most people in real estate and banking know their own net worth.
Asking folks in these circles, “What’s your net worth?” is about as
natural as asking them their name. When we ask most consumers
to estimate their net worth, however, they look puzzled, as if we
had asked them for the square root of pi. They simply have better
things to entertain themselves.
Net worth is simply whatever money you would have if you sold all
your stuff and then paid off all your debts, including your taxes.
Officially, the equation goes like this:
Net Worth = Assets – Liabilities
A strong positive net worth indicates that you
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 49

 Own more than you owe
 Don’t borrow more than you can afford to pay back
 Can pay off a loan by liquidating assets, if needed
 Pay your taxes on time
 Probably know more about net worth than you realize
To prove to a lender that you’re net worthy, follow these simple
steps to calculate your net worth:
1. Jot down a list of your assets and liabilities.
The tough part is identifying assets and liabilities.
Following these steps are lists of common assets and liabili-
ties, which can help you identify yours.
2. Total your assets.
3. Subtract your liabilities.
The next time someone asks, “What’s your net worth?”
you’re prepared to answer.
The following lists of items may stimulate your brain cells and help
you identify different examples of assets and liabilities.
 Home: If you sold your home today, what could you get for it?
If you recently had an appraisal, use that number, assuming
the appraiser assigned it an honest value.
 Other real estate: If you have a vacation home or other real
estate, consider how much you could get for it if you sold it
today.
 Car: The blue book value (current value), not what you paid
for it.
 Savings account: Whether you have $5 or $50,000, it counts.
 Checking account: The current balance as recorded in your
check register. No cheating. If you just wrote five checks that
haven’t cleared yet, you don’t really have that money.
 Retirement savings: 401(k), IRA, SEP, or other account that
you don’t dip into for your daily living expenses.
 Investments: Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that aren’t part
of a retirement account.
 Jewelry, antiques, and artwork: If you’re not sure what this
stuff is worth, have it professionally appraised. People often
think that their stuff is worth much more than it really is.
 Furniture: If you sold all your furniture at an auction or
garage sale, what could you get for it?
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
50

 Cash value of life insurance: If you have term life insurance,
it’s worth $0. If you use a life insurance policy as an 
investment, how much is it worth today?
If you don’t have it, don’t count it. The money you stand to inherit
when Aunt Millie kicks the bucket doesn’t count.
Now for the painful part — liabilities. These are items such as the
following:
 Mortgage principal: The amount you owe on your house
today and on any other loans you’ve taken out on the house.
 Car loan: How much would paying off your car loan today
cost? Write it down.
 Student loans: If you’re paying off any student loans from
your old college days or are named as a cosigner on any of
your kids’ student loans, record the amounts as liabilities.
 Credit card debt: Dig out your credit card bills and tally up
the total you currently owe on them.
 Taxes owed: Do you owe any back taxes or property taxes?
Total the amount.
 Personal loans: Did you borrow $5 from the neighbor to buy
candy from the neighborhood kids? Write it down.
You may be able to obtain most of the liability information you
need from your credit report, as discussed earlier in this chapter
in the section “Examining Your Credit Reports.” However, if you
know that you have a debt that doesn’t appear on the credit
report, be sure to include it in your calculations.
Calculating your debt ratio
Almost every lender examines your debt ratio, so you should know
what it is before the topic ever comes up. Your debt ratio is how
much you pay out in monthly bills compared to your gross
monthly income. Generally speaking, you can estimate your debt
ratio by dividing your total monthly payments (on loans and credit
cards) by your total monthly income:
Debt Ratio = Total Monthly Payments ÷ Total Monthly Income
Your total monthly payments apply only to payments on loans and
credit card balances, not for other expenses like groceries, gas, or
clothing. They include payments on long-term debts, such as a car
loan or student loan payments, alimony, child support, or a bal-
ance you carry on one or more credit cards. Debt ratios come in
two flavors:
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 51

 Back-end debt ratio: The back-end ratio consists of your total
debt payments (including your house payment with home-
owner’s insurance and property taxes) divided by your
monthly income. According to the Federal Housing Authority
(FHA), your back-end debt ratio should not exceed 43 percent.
 Front-end debt ratio: The front-end debt ratio (also called the
housing ratio) consists of your house payment alone (includ-
ing property taxes and insurance) divided by your total
monthly income. According to the FHA, your front-end debt
ratio should not exceed 31 percent. If your total gross house-
hold income is $6,000 per month, for example, your house
payment alone should not exceed $1,860.
Gathering bank statements
Almost all lenders are going to ask for copies of the most recent
two months’ bank statements, so they can see how much cash you
have in savings and checking, determine whether you have a
healthy cash flow, and check for any activity that looks out of the
ordinary (such as large deposits or withdrawals that can’t be
explained by other documentation). Make a copy of your two most
recent bank statements — whether you receive statements
monthly or quarterly.
On the copies, take a black magic marker and mark out the
account numbers to prevent others from gaining unauthorized
access to your accounts.
Tracking down your pay stubs and W-2s
If you work a regular job, you probably get a paycheck every week
or two that shows your gross pay, your deductions (state and fed-
eral income tax, Social Security, and so on), and what’s left — your
net pay. Most lenders want a full month (30 days’ worth) of consec-
utive paycheck stubs — not one from last week and another from
two months ago; they need to be the most recent and consecutive.
They should also show your year-to-date (YTD) earnings.
Most lenders also want to see proof of previous years’ income. Of
course, they can obtain this evidence by looking at your previous
two years of federal income tax returns, but many lenders also like
to see your W-2 forms, so be sure to make copies of these as well.
If you don’t have a regular job, skip ahead to the section
“Accounting for business income” to find out which records you
need to supply to prove your business income.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
52

Gathering tax returns and schedules
Every lender requires you to submit along with your loan applica-
tion your federal income tax returns. Make sure you provide copies
of your two most recent federal income tax returns. Copy the com-
plete federal tax return, including all schedules and attachments,
not just the first two pages of the return. Include everything — don’t
leave something out just because you don’t think it’s relevant.
You don’t need to supply your state income tax returns unless state
grants or subsidies are involved in the transaction or financing.
Pulling up other useful documents
If you follow the instructions in the previous sections, you now
have all the major facts, figures, and documentation you need
related to your personal finances. However, additional documenta-
tion may also be useful (and necessary) in determining whether
you qualify for a particular loan. Your lender or broker may need
the following:
 Any documents that support your income, such as employ-
ment contracts with step increases; union benefit agreements;
notes receivable; real estate earnings; earnings from trusts,
estates, or settlements; or documentation showing major lot-
tery winnings.
 Property income, including GAI (Gross Annual Income) from
rents; storage fees; fees for facilities, such as clubhouse,
pools, satellite TV, cable, laundry, or Internet; parking or car-
port fees; pet income; income from signage; a percentage of
tenant sales (for retail commercial properties); and so on.
 Documentation of any unusual liabilities (or the exclusion of
them), such as major reimbursed business expenses, person-
ally guaranteed business loans (appearing on your credit
report), or old loans that you’ve paid off but that haven’t
cleared from your report.
Create copies of any documentation that supports your claims of
assets, liabilities, and income. Prospective lenders may request
specific documents, but gathering everything you have available in
advance makes your job that much easier later on.
Accounting for business income
If you don’t have a regular job or you have income (or losses) from
a business, you need to supply proof of your income or loss:
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 53

 Some of this documentation may already be included in your
federal income tax returns. Be sure to include all schedules
(C’s E’s, K-1’s, and so on) so that the lender has an accurate
picture of each of your investments and business holdings.
 If you own 25 percent or more of any company, corporation,
or LLC, provide copies of each entity’s federal returns for the
past two years.
 To provide more recent data, produce a report showing YTD
income and expenses for the business. You can produce such
reports fairly easily by using a business or personal finance
program, such as Quicken or QuickBooks. If you have an
accountant, ask the accountant to produce a report for you.
Documenting the property 
you plan to purchase
Your gut feeling that a particular property is a great investment
may be enough to convince you to sign a purchase agreement, but
it’s rarely enough to convince lenders to finance the purchase. You
need to have a plan in place for how you’re going to profit from the
investment, complete with fairly realistic estimates concerning the
costs and revenue potential.
Many novice investors view the loan application process as a big
hassle that just gets in the way of their vision and profits. However,
by forcing you to think ahead, the process actually protects you
from making bad investment decisions. As an investor, you should
only purchase a property to make money or create future wealth,
and you should be able to show how an investment will further
those goals before you ever sign a purchase agreement.
In the following sections, we show you how to estimate and 
document the profit potential for investment properties.
Obtaining an appraisal or comparative market analysis
As a real estate investor, your goal is to discover properties that are
likely to generate profits. Basically you don’t want to pay more for
the property than it’s worth. To help in your calculations, get your
hands on a comparative market analysis or appraisal. Your real
estate agent can provide you with a comparative market analysis
that shows the probable value of the property in relation to similar
properties that have sold recently or are currently on the market.
You want to keep your eyes open for property that’s likely to make
you profits in one or both of the following two ways:
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
54

 Income from sale: You’re looking to buy low and sell high or
legally “flip” the property. For more about flipping properties,
check out Flipping Houses For Dummies.
 Rental income: You’re planning a buy-and-hold strategy, in
which your rental income covers (or more than covers) your
expenses until you decide to sell the property (hopefully for
more than you paid for it).
If you want something more formal and more detailed, you may
consider hiring an appraiser. A qualified appraiser can evaluate the
market value of the property (to assist in estimating your potential
income from selling it) or evaluate the income of the property by
using a Net Operating Income (NOI) formula (see Chapter 8).
When you’re just checking out some properties, bringing in an
appraiser may be premature (and an unnecessary expense). Most
investors rely on their own market knowledge and perhaps their
agents’ insight to estimate the property’s value. The appraiser
enters the picture just prior to closing to confirm that the property
is worth the price you’re paying. However, if you’re seriously consid-
ering a property and are questioning your instincts, you may want to
hire an appraiser for a second opinion before moving forward.
The seller whose property you’re thinking of buying may already
have had an appraisal done, in which case, you may be able to
review it just by asking. (Don’t place blind faith in the seller’s
appraisal — use it only to confirm or question your own evaluation.) 
Looking ahead to potential resale value and repair costs
When you obtain an appraisal, the appraiser usually takes into
account the property’s current condition. If you plan to flip the
property for a quick profit, estimate the market value of the prop-
erty after repairs. What’s a realistic price you think you can get for
the property after fixing it up? Your real estate agent should be
able to help you come up with a realistic value.
You also need to estimate your total costs for the project, includ-
ing the cost of repairs and renovations, holding costs for the dura-
tion of the project (the total you plan to spend on loan interest,
property taxes, loan interest, and utilities), and the cost of selling
the property (any real estate agent commissions and closing fees).
Overestimate costs and underestimate the final sale price, so you
have a bit of a buffer. For details about making well-calculated
investments when flipping properties, check out Flipping Houses
For Dummies by none other than Ralph and Joe, two of your
esteemed authors (Wiley).
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 55

If you’re planning on holding the property for several years rather
than doing a quick flip, you still need to consider the potential
future value of the property. For example, if you’re buying into a
neighborhood where home values are on the rise, then paying close
to the appraised value of the property may make sense. The ques-
tion you need to answer is this: How likely is it that I will more than
recoup my investment when I finally decide to sell the property?
Performing a quick cash flow analysis
One of the best ways to build wealth in real estate is to purchase
property and hold it indefinitely. During the time you hold the prop-
erty, you profit in three ways:
 The property appreciates, gaining in value.
 Renters pay down your principal (the amount you owe on the
property).
 You get a tax write-off for any expenses you incur relating to
the rental property.
Of course, your profit hinges on the assumption that you earn
more in rent than the property costs you in expenses (including
taxes, insurance, landlord-paid utilities, repairs, and improve-
ments). In short, you (and your lenders) want to make sure that
that your investment delivers a positive cash flow so you’re not
losing money.
The formulas for calculating cash flow (or NOI) are fairly basic:
GAI – VAC = EGI
EGI – TOE = NOI
If those formulas look like Greek to you, read on:
 GAI is your Gross Annual Income; simply calculate your
yearly income from all possible sources (rent, carport, laun-
dry, storage, parking, and so on).
 VAC is a vacancy allowance; use a minimum of 5 percent of
the GAI to allow for vacancy (periods when you have no
renters).
 EGI is your Effective Gross Income — the total workable rev-
enue you see from the property. Another way of looking at it is
that this is the amount of money you have on hand to cover
your property’s expenses.
 TOE represents your Total Operating Expenses; this figure
includes all the costs to operate the property, except the loan
payments. It includes maintenance, taxes, insurance, 
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
56

management, landscaping, landlord-paid utilities, office
expenses, and so on.
 NOI is your Net Operating Income; this number represents
your profit on a yearly basis, assuming you pay cash for the
property.
This formula works for all buy-and-hold properties. It shows you
and your lenders how much you can afford to pay monthly for the
financing. We look at calculating those numbers in Chapter 8.
Calculating the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio
The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a mathematic representation of how
much you owe on your home compared to its appraised value.
Banks use LTVs to justify lending money to high-risk borrowers.
Even if you have a low credit score and a history of paying your
bills a little late, a bank may be willing to cut you some slack and
approve your loan if your LTV ratio is low. In other words, the more
equity you have in your home, the more likely the bank will
approve your loan.
For example, if your home appraises for $250,000 and you owe
$200,000 on it, the LTV is $200,000 ÷ $250,000, or 80 percent.
Anything below 80 percent is considered great and often qualifies
you to borrow more money at a lower interest rate.
Be realistic and know how much you can really afford to borrow.
Don’t cause yourself stress and future problems by trying to stretch
your finances too thin. If after you do your calculations it looks as
though you can’t afford to borrow more money, don’t. Check out
some of your other options instead, as we explain in Part IV.
Obtaining zoning information
Most counties or cities zone properties for specific uses, usually to
keep businesses out of residential districts or vice versa. Before
you purchase a property, find out how it’s zoned so you know
about anything that could restrict the way you use the property.
Check with the local city or county assessment or building 
inspection office regarding the following:
 How the property is currently zoned
 Any plans to change the zoning for this area
 Whether your intended use of the property fits the current
and any new zoning restrictions
 Whether the property is subject to changes in zoning require-
ments; some properties have “grandfather” clauses that allow
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 57

them to operate without being subject to changes in the zoning
requirements, but these clauses may expire when ownership of
a property changes
Pulling city and county records
When you’re investing in real estate, knowledge is power; the more
you know about a property before you buy it, the less likely you
are to encounter nasty surprises later. The info you gather may
also improve your chances of obtaining financing to purchase and
restore the property. One way to obtain additional information is
to research the public records.
Call the city or county assessor’s office or the County Real Estate
Mapping Division (every county has one) and find out how to
access the parcel maps, aerial maps, tax records, building records,
zoning or building appeals, violations, and ownership records. The
county has to make all these documents available to the public.
Many cities and townships post their records and even property
histories online.
If you notice any red flags in the property records, such as a build-
ing code violation, address them before you purchase the property
and they become your headache. In many cases, liabilities for viola-
tions and/or discrepancies (such as boundary lines, easements,
riparian rights [relating to a body of water], natural resource claims,
and so on) reach back to only a certain number of previous owners.
You don’t want to get stuck on the hook for someone else’s problem
from long ago.
Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments

Zoning fiasco
If you think that zoning restrictions are something you can deal with later, think
again — they may just deal with you later. Several years ago, I (Chip) bought a
property without thinking too much about zoning restrictions and grandfather
clauses. I planned to use the property pretty much the same way the owner before
me used it. Because no grandfather clause was in place that would expire when
I took ownership, I figured I was safe.
Unfortunately, a different type of grandfather clause was in place — one I hadn’t con-
sidered. The clause stated that if the property burned down, nothing could be built in
its place. The lot would have to remain vacant regardless of how it was zoned!
Fortunately, the building didn’t burn down when I owned it, but getting insurance
was tough, and I was severely limited in what I could do with the property. It was
zoned for multifamily, but I had to convert it back to single family to get the Certificate
of Occupancy that’s required before you can lease the property.

The “cleaner” the package, and more documentation you have, the
more valuable the property becomes — and the easier to sell later
on. Get your ducks in a row early on so that problems don’t cause
expensive delays later.
Show Me the Money: Identifying
Sources of Ready Cash
When you’re applying for a loan, the lender will ask you to do one
important thing: “Show me the money!” Where will you get the nec-
essary cash for the down payment, the closing costs, the pre-paid
items, any repairs or inspections, any third-party fees, or commis-
sions? Do you have sufficient cash reserves to cover unexpected
expenses or income shortfalls?
You need to be able explain and document those sources of avail-
able cash, as we discuss in the following sections.
Sources of cash for down payments,
closing costs, and prepaid items
Although you can usually count on financing the major portion of
the purchase price, you probably need to pay some closing costs
and other expenses out of pocket. Your lender wants to know up
front where the money’s going to come from. The money can come
from just about any source, as long as you have documentation to
prove the money exists:
 Checking and savings accounts
 Retirement accounts
 Money from the sale of other properties
 Refinancing or selling other assets
 Commissions
 Bonuses
 Gifts
 New loans
Documentation can include bank or other financial statements,
sales receipts, HUD-1’s from the sale/refinance of real estate, loan
agreements, and credit card statements.
Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 59

Rainy day funds: Cash reserves
On most transactions, lenders want to know you have reserves —
cash set aside to cover the cost of unpleasant surprises. Simple
transactions may require two to three months’ cash reserves of the
monthly payment or principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI).
More-complex transactions may require reserves for construction
allowances, credit losses, tenant improvements, and replacement
reserves (for example, for new refrigerators or stoves in apartment
units). The lender establishes the reserve requirements, and different
lenders have different guidelines for calculating minimum reserves.
The more reserves you have, the better. Even shaky loans get
approved based on a borrower having strong reserves.
Getting Prequalified 
or Preapproved
You’re always in a stronger position to purchase a property at an
attractive price if you have cash or financing in place when making
your offer. Cash is king. Financing is queen. Having to secure
financing is about a 2. Because you’re reading a book on financing,
we can safely assume that, like most investors, you don’t have
enough cash on hand to purchase investment properties. The next
best option is to prequalify or obtain preapproval for a loan:
 Prequalification: Prequalification means a lender or broker has
reviewed your financial records and determined that you would
probably qualify for a particular loan. The lender performs some
basic calculations to determine whether your front-end and
back-end debt ratios meet the FHA qualification requirements.
 Preapproval: Preapproval is a more formal, final step in which
the lender obtains all the borrower’s documentation and
underwrites the loan — without a property. With preapproval,
the lender agrees to finance the purchase of an investment
property up to a certain amount. As long as the property 
complies with the lender’s standards, the loan is a done deal.
Gaining preapproval puts you in a much stronger position to nego-
tiate. To the seller, it’s almost as good as cash. Preapproval is also
much better for you as a borrower because it insulates you from
changing market conditions. You can move quickly on a property
and lock in an approval even if credit tightens and interest rates
rise. (Chapter 7 leads you through the loan process so you can do
everything necessary to obtain preapproval.)

o pursue your dream of owning some investment property, you
need some start-up cash. Sure, you can shake all the money
out of your piggy bank and cookie jar, but that probably won’t
score you enough cash to finance your first major acquisition. You
need serious cash — probably at least 100 grand — and you don’t
want to have to go through the neighborhood loan shark to get it.
If you haven’t shopped for money before, you may have the mis-
conception that the answer is simple — just head down to the
bank. But as we reveal in this chapter, you have many more
options from which to choose. If the bank won’t loan you the
money or offer you a decent deal, maybe someone else will.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the money lenders, including
bankers, brokers, and some less-conventional sorts. You may be
surprised at the variety available. In later chapters, we get into the
nitty-gritty of actually asking for the money.
Borrowing Directly from Banks
You don’t need a treasure map to locate huge stores of cash. At
just about every major intersection in every town or city, you can
find a bank chock-full of greenbacks. Unfortunately, depending on

Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
62
market conditions, your friendly neighborhood bank may not be as
eager as you might expect to give you the combination to the vault.
But is a bank the best place to go for a loan? Maybe, maybe not. In
the following sections, we weigh the pros and cons of financing
through a bank and examine the types of loans banks typically
offer. After reading through these sections, you should have a
pretty clear idea of what banks can and can’t do for you as an
investor.
Weighing the pros and cons
Financing your investments through a bank, particularly the bank
you use to manage your personal finances, may seem like the perfect
solution, at first. It’s probably convenient, you already know some of
the people, and you feel comfortable doing business with them.
Don’t dismiss any source of financing without first exploring it.
Before you head down to your bank to apply for a loan, however,
weigh the pros and cons of borrowing from a bank. You may dis-
cover that a bank is the perfect solution for your financing needs
or that the perfect solution isn’t so ideal after all.
Pros
Financing your real estate investments through a bank, especially a
local bank, offers several perks, including the following:
 Security and reliability: Federally insured banks are generally
dependable institutions, although even the most solid institu-
tions are vulnerable to bankruptcy.
 Convenience: Banks typically have many branches, which can
give you access to convenient locations when you need assis-
tance or a quick draw from a line of credit to act on an invest-
ment opportunity.
 Portfolio lending: Smaller financial institutions, including
banks and credit unions, may be more open to holding loans in
their own portfolios rather than selling them to bigger banks
or mortgage companies. This allows them to be more flexible
on interest and terms. However, portfolio lending is usually
available only for short-term (less than three years) loans.
 Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) goals: Banks may be
required by federal law to lend money for certain projects
(including residential and commercial properties) within their
immediate geographical area. A lucrative rehabilitation invest-
ment project can get the green light just because of the bank’s
CRA requirements. (For more about the CRA option, check out
Chapter 9.)

 Insights and guidance: Local banks understand the local real
estate market. They’re aware of trends and market conditions,
and can provide a great deal of insight into the viability of an
investment property in a specific area. Your banker may just
develop into your own personal real estate investment advisor.
 Preferential treatment: Although the world may seem to be
becoming more impersonal, relationships still count, espe-
cially when dealing with money. As you develop a relationship
with people at the bank, especially loan officers and execu-
tives, you place yourself in a stronger position to negotiate
more affordable loans.
 Improved access to REO properties: When a bank forecloses
on a mortgage, it often takes possession of the foreclosure
property and transfers it to its Real Estate Owned (REO)
department, which then tries to sell the property. If everyone at
the bank knows you as a trustworthy investor, you may have a
better chance of obtaining good deals on these properties.
During economic slowdowns, when credit usually tightens, REO
(or bank-owned) properties become more available. In addition,
because banks get stuck holding so many of these properties, they’re
often willing to finance purchases. Through careful negotiations, you
can not only buy properties at great prices but also have the bank
finance them. For more about this strategy, check out Chapter 17.
Cons
Although banks offer a host of valuable benefits, they also come
with a few drawbacks, including the following:
 Limited financing options: Unlike brokers, banks don’t help
you shop for loans. They can offer you the loan programs
from their own menu only. They may not even offer certain
loans (such as government loans) for particular types of prop-
erties. A mortgage broker can provide more options by work-
ing with dozens of banks. Check out “Dealing with a
Middleman (or Woman): Brokers” later in this chapter.
 Possible complications: Many banks broker their loans out
(sell them to other lenders or institutions), so you end up
dealing with another lender anyway without reaping any of
the benefits of working through a broker, such as a faster,
hassle-free closing.
 Possible loan processing delays: Many banks rely on hourly
employees to handle loan transactions. As a result, they have no
financial incentive to wrap things up quickly. Mortgage brokers,
on the other hand, are paid only when the loan closes. They’re
typically paid on a straight commission for producing the loan,
so they have an added incentive to see that it closes quickly.

Conventional loans
Banks typically deal in loans that are considered conventional or
conforming — meaning the loan conforms to all the requirements
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (see the nearby sidebar).
Conventional loans are the bread and butter of residential real
estate financing, particularly for homeowners but also for
investors. With conventional loans, you can always be sure that
 Capital is available.
 Loan costs and interest rates are generally attractive.
 Interest rates among lenders vary only slightly because the
money is coming from Wall Street through Fannie and Freddie.
Because conventional loans are primarily intended for consumers
borrowing money to purchase a home, plenty of information is
available on how to find the best deals on conventional mortgages.

Conventional loans are also available for investors, although they
tend to cost more and be more restrictive — with a loan-to-value)

Mortgage broker or loan officer?
You’re likely to hear plenty of industry lingo bandied about, but the first two terms
you need to sort out are “mortgage broker” and “loan officer.” A mortgage broker
is a licensed company or professional who assists clients in finding and arranging
financing through lenders. Brokers are regulated by the state. A loan officer may
simply be an individual who works on behalf of a licensed lender or mortgage broker
to facilitate the process. Some states license the individual loan officers as brokers.
For all practical purposes, a loan officer offers the same services as a mortgage
broker but is required by law to work for the licensed broker or lender. It’s sort of like
going into your doctor’s office and seeing a nurse practitioner — sometimes the
practitioner offers better advice than the doctor even though the practitioner isn’t
licensed to practice medicine.
Of course, you’re usually better off working directly with an experienced broker, but
if you find a great loan officer, you may do just as well or better.

Chapter 6.) As an investor, keep in mind that having access to cash
is often more important than the cost of gaining access.
Subprime (nonconforming) loans
Subprime loans (also known as nonconforming loans), are the bad
boys of the mortgage lending industry. At least that’s what many
people were led to believe during the great mortgage meltdown in
the late 2000s. Due to some irresponsible underwriting by lenders
and irresponsible borrowing on the part of consumers, subprime
loans did contribute to the mortgage meltdown, but that doesn’t
make them all bad. They do serve a useful purpose when used
appropriately.
Subprime loans are everything that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
aren’t. Although some subprime loans known as Alt-A loans can go
through Fannie and Freddie, most don’t. (An Alt-A loan or alterna-
tive A-paper loan is one for which the approval is based primarily
on the borrower’s lower credit score, or other situations such as
self-employment, that increase the risk of repayment.) Instead,
subprime loans are usually available through other institutional
investors, pension funds, insurance companies, various large and
small mortgage banking firms, and even individuals.
Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 65
Fannie and Freddie who?
The question is more like “Fannie and Freddie what?” Fannie Mae is actually a nick-
name for the FNMA, or Federal National Mortgage Association. Freddie Mac is a
nickname for FHLMC, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Both organizations do pretty much the same thing — they purchase residential mort-
gages and then convert the mortgages into securities for sale to Wall Street investors,
indirectly financing the purchase of homes. In other words, they sort of act as the
middlemen between banks and Wall Street investors. The end result is that they make
money readily available for the purchase of homes and other real estate.
Although both institutions began as government-chartered, private companies,
they’re now controlled by the government as a result of the problems they ran into
during the mortgage meltdown that started in 2008. While we were writing this book,
it was still too early to tell whether the end result would be a consolidation, merger,
or something else entirely, but whatever happens, Fannie and Freddie should essen-
tially function the same way but with more restrictions.

66
Instead of Fannie and Freddie setting the qualifications for these
loans, the market and individual investors lay down the rules and
decide what’s available and to whom. As a result, they can offer a
much greater variety of loan packages that appeal to niche markets
and address specific needs, such as the following:
 Limited-documentation loans make it easier for investors who
don’t have the necessary financial documents (tax returns,
pay check stubs, and W-2s) to qualify for loans.
 Hybrid adjustable rate loans can help investors with short-term
financing and cash flow by providing flexibility in interest rates.
 Rehabilitation programs can open doors to investors by 
funding special projects or development in certain areas.
Subprime loans have some drawbacks, particularly if the borrower
doesn’t fully understand the terms, which can be complicated. When
shopping for any loan, make sure you’re working with a qualified and
trustworthy professional who can clearly explain your options and
the ramifications of choosing a particular option. In short, know what
you’re getting into before signing on the dotted line.
One of the main drawbacks of subprime mortgages is that certain
programs can disappear overnight as the appetites of Wall Street
investors and consumers change. Numerous creative subprime loan
packages emerged leading up to the mortgage meltdown, and many
of these options disappeared as soon as loan defaults shot up.
Dealing with a Middleman (or
Woman): Mortgage Brokers
A mortgage broker is sort of like a real estate agent, but instead of
helping you find the right house, the broker helps you find the
right loan. Ideally, a broker sits down with you to determine what
you’re planning on using the money for and then assists you in
selecting the lender and loan package that best meets your needs.
Through a broker, you gain access to dozens of financing options
as opposed to the limited few you may find with a local bank.
In the following sections, we discuss the pros and cons of working
through a broker and then show you how to find brokers and
research their credentials and references.

Weighing the pros and cons
As you probably already guessed, we think that most investors can
benefit by shopping for loans through a broker — a good broker,
that is. In the following sections, we list the reasons why. To give a
balanced perspective, we also list a couple of reasons why you
may not want to use a broker. Furthermore we give you clues to
uncovering a good broker and what you can do to verify the broker
is reputable and the right choice for you.
Pros
Mortgage brokers offer a host of benefits for fueling your real
estate purchases and development, including the following:
 Better selection: A broker has access to many different
lenders, each of whom may offer several different loan pack-
ages, so you’re more likely to find a loan that meets your
unique needs.
 Bargaining power: Mortgage brokers can negotiate fees and
terms with large lenders and play one off the other to negoti-
ate the best deal on your behalf.
 Marketplace knowledge: Brokers are more in tune with new
and creative financing programs and options. When new pro-
grams become available, they’re often the first to know.
Although mortgage brokers specialize in the mortgage lending indus-
try, many are also very knowledgeable about the real estate market in
their area. In addition, a well-established broker is likely to have con-
nections with other investors, local bankers, real estate attorneys,
and so forth. Take full advantage of what your broker has to offer.
Cons
Mortgage brokers are sort of like doctors and lawyers — if you find
the right one, you have no reason not to use a broker. However,
finding and keeping a qualified broker who’s dedicated to serving
your needs can be quite a challenge. Watch out for the following:
 Lack of experience: Many brokers may not be experienced
enough or large enough to deal with the right lenders. You can
spend a lot of time researching and checking credentials and
references before you find a great broker.
 High turnover: Brokers can disappear overnight. Becoming a
broker doesn’t require a huge capital investment, so brokers
often come and go. After a long search, you may find a top-
notch broker only to discover that several months later the
person is no longer in business. You may end up losing time,
money, and a valuable resource.

Shaking the branches for a broker
Although you can certainly flip through the “Mortgages” section of
the phone-book ads or search the Internet for “mortgage brokers
any town, your state USA” to find brokers in your area, these meth-
ods don’t focus in on the highest quality prospects. The best way
to find qualified, experienced mortgage brokers is to search
through the people who actually borrow money to finance their
real estate investments — real estate investors.
Obtain referrals from investors in your area, so you know the
broker has experience working with investors and has provided
satisfactory service to at least one person. Most investors will also
tell you which brokers to avoid.
If you don’t know other real estate investors in your area, you have
some work to do. Join a reputable real estate investment club such
as the Rental Property Owners Association (RPOA) and start net-
working. (Search the Web for “rental property owners association”
followed by your state.) You can pick up plenty of market knowl-
edge just by attending meetings and talking with people who’ve
been there and done that.
Checking a broker’s credentials
Ideally, a mortgage broker works on your behalf to find you the
best deal. Unfortunately, brokers don’t have a fiduciary (legal finan-
cial) responsibility to you as the borrower. As a result, some bro-
kers may try to sell you on a loan that brings them a higher
commission rather than provide you with a better deal. This is why
finding a trustworthy broker who has a stellar reputation is so
important.
In the following sections, we show you how to do your own back-
ground check on mortgage brokers, verify their credentials, and
interview the top three candidates.
Doing a background check
After you have a list of possible candidates, start trimming that list
to three finalists by doing a background check on each candidate:
 Check the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB)
Web site at www.namb.org to make sure the broker is a
member. NAMB members follow a strict code of ethics, tend
to be more dedicated to the profession, and are required to
take continuing education courses.

 Search the Internet for the company’s or individual’s name.
If the candidate has a bad reputation, dissatisfied clients are
likely to post something about it on the Web.
 If the company or individual has a Web site or blog, visit the
site and explore. Make sure the broker deals in both conven-
tional and subprime loans. The more established brokers also
offer government loans, including Federal Housing Authority
(FHA) and Veteran’s Administration (VA) loans. (Check out the
section “Borrowing from Uncle Sam: Government Loan
Programs” later in this chapter for these types of loans.)
 Visit your state’s Web site and verify that the broker is
licensed in your state. If you can’t find your state’s Web site,
call the licensing board in your state capital. All 50 states have
licensing requirements for mortgage lenders. Some states have
licensing for individuals as well. Check for any administrative
actions or sanctions, or complaints (many complaints aren’t
public unless the department of licensing takes action). You
may also want to check your state attorney general’s Web site.
 Check the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for any complaints.
Start at the national Web site’s home page at (www.bbb.org),
which can direct you to the Web site for your local branch.
 Contact your local chamber of commerce to determine
whether the broker is a member in good standing. Being an
established member of the local business community is
always a big plus.
 Contact each broker who’s made the first cut and obtain
three references from investors and three references from
real estate agents the broker has worked with. (Make sure
the real estate agents are well-established in the community,
not just part-timers.) Call the references and ask about their
experience working with the broker.
Don’t just go with the broker who has the largest ad in the phone
book or the local newspaper. Check their credentials with the state
licensing board, the BBB, and the state attorney general’s office for
complaints and/or regulatory actions or sanctions.
Interviewing the top candidates
After you’ve chopped your list of candidates down to three, call to
set up an interview with each of them. During the interview, be
sure to ask the following questions:
 How long have you been in business? You’re looking for
someone who’s been a broker for at least a couple of years.
 How many transactions do you process in a year? Good bro-
kers average at least 40 to 50 transactions per year. Someone
Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 69

Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
70
who processes way fewer than average may lack motivation.
A broker who processes way more may not be careful enough.
 What percentage of your transactions are conventional,
non-conventional, and government loans? Brokers generally
deal with far more conventional loans, but look for a broker
who has experience with all three types.
 What percentage of your transactions are investor loans?
Brokers who do a substantial percentage of their business
with investors are usually a better choice than those who
exclusively serve consumers/homeowners.
 How many lenders do you work with? Generally speaking,
the more the merrier. The more lenders the broker has access
to, the wider the selection of loan packages.
 What’s your specialty? Just as real estate agents specialize in
certain types of homes, mortgage brokers specialize in certain
types of loans (such as government loans, first-time home
buyers, construction loans, and so on). Choose a broker who
specializes in the types of loans that best fit your investment
strategy. (See Chapters 5 and 9 for descriptions of different
residential and commercial loan types.)
 What are your application fee requirements? Determine how
much money the mortgage broker charges upfront at the time
of application and what those fees are applied toward.
Compare costs among the brokers and make sure they’re
applying any fees to real services rather than pocketing them
as extra money.
 What’s your policy on locking in interest rates? Does locking
in a rate cost extra? How long does the rate remain locked?
How soon before closing does the rate have to be locked?
 What’s your refund policy for cancelled loan applications?
Some brokers actually charge upfront fees up to $1,000 or
more if you cancel a loan application. You’re better off know-
ing about it now than when you need to cancel an application.
During the interview, make sure you get along with the broker and
that your personalities match up pretty well. If this is a good fit,
you’ll be working together for some time. You want somebody you
can get along with.
Taking the Hard-Money Route
through Private Lenders
Hard money is called “hard” for a reason — it’s hard to get, hard to
pay, and generally costs more than your average loan. Hard money

comes from individuals or small groups of private investors who
like to obtain a high return on their money and are willing to take
some additional risk in order to get it.
Because hard money costs more, you may wonder why anyone on
earth would even consider it. Just like any other type of invest-
ment method, hard money has its upsides and downsides. Hard
money offers several benefits:
 More financing options: You gain access to cash you may not
be able to get through a conventional lender. Hard money
loans typically cost more in points upfront and interest, but
the terms can be more flexible than with conventional loans.
 More collateral options: Hard-money lenders often accept the
future value (after renovations) of a property as collateral, so
you don’t have to borrow against other assets, like your home.
 More flexibility: You can often close the transaction faster, with
less paperwork, and even set up a separate escrow account
with a hard money lender to pay for repairs and renovations.
 Less intrusion into your business: Banks tend to be more
intrusive, wanting more information about the business oper-
ation than a hard money investor does. The hard-money
lender sets a lower LTV requirement, so you have less equity
risk from the start. Even so, hard-money lenders do want to
know the plan for repayment and see a business plan if it’s
contingent on a business tenancy arrangement.
On the flipside, hard money does have a few significant drawbacks:
 Higher cost: Sometimes gaining access to cash, whatever the
cost, is good investment decision — as long as you account
for that cost in your calculations and can still turn the profit
you want.
 Lower ratios: Another disadvantage of hard-money loans is
that the LTV’s (loan-to-value ratios) are typically lower. For
example, instead of being able to borrow 80 to 90 percent of
the value of the property, you may only be able to borrow 65
to 75 percent. However, hard-money lenders are often willing
to make the calculations on the future value of the property.
For more about using hard money to finance your real estate
investments, check out Chapter 11.
Hard-money lenders may be more willing to negotiate with
investors, especially investors who have a solid track record. Some
lenders, for instance, may charge three or four points upfront to
reduce their exposure to the risk of an early default but then agree
to refund one or two points when you’ve paid off the loan.

Borrowing from Uncle Sam:
Government Loan Programs
The housing market plays an important role in driving the econ-
omy, so the U.S. government does what it can to support this key
industry. One of the primary support mechanisms are government
(or government-secured) loans made available to first-time home
buyers. If you’re like most Americans, you probably used an FHA
(Federal Housing Administration) or VA (Veterans Administration)
loan to purchase your first home.
Through the FHA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) also offers loans to homeowners and
investors to assist in rehabilitating properties. Government loans
are designed to help the marketplace in areas where the private
sector can’t. After Hurricane Katrina, for example, several govern-
ment programs came to the rescue, encouraging investors to assist
in rebuilding the damaged areas. Special grants and state and fed-
eral loan programs gave investors access to cash that the banks
and private sector wouldn’t or couldn’t offer.
In most cases, the government steers clear of lending money
directly to homeowners and investors. Instead, the government
secures the loans. If the borrower fails to pay back the loan, the
government steps in, picks up the tab, takes the property, and tries
to sell it to recoup its loss. Additionally, most government programs
are limited to owner-occupied properties.
As a homeowner, you’re already aware of some of the benefits that
government-secured loans offer homeowners, but government
loans can also benefit investors in two important ways:
 Understanding government loans can enable you to flip the
property to a buyer down the road. For example, the Good
Neighbor Next Door loan (GNND) enables qualified buyers
(including teachers, law-enforcement professionals, and fire-
fighters) to purchase certain HUD homes with only a $100
down payment, or even some HUD repo’s at half price; 203(k)
loans help an owner rehabilitate a property, pay for additions,
and even purchase new appliances. Using the GNND loan and
a 203k loan, a qualified investor can actually buy a home for
half its market value with a $100 down payment and then sell
it several years down the road to earn a handsome profit.
 You may be able to purchase government-owned properties
directly (usually those foreclosed on due to nonpayment of an
FHA or VA loan) and finance the purchase through the govern-
ment agency.

For more about using specific government-sponsored loan pro-
grams to finance real estate purchases and rehabilitation, see
Chapter 5.
Financing through the Seller
Before most homeowners can pack up and move, they have to sell
their homes and pay off their current mortgages so they can afford
to buy their new homes. Homeowners who’ve paid off their mort-
gages or have sufficient cash available, however, don’t need the full
purchase price upfront. They can sell you the home and finance
the purchase. In other words, the seller becomes the bank.
If a seller is willing and able, you can often purchase the property
on contract through a lease option agreement or a land contract.
The contract takes the place of the mortgage document that most
buyers sign when they close on a house. In the following sections,
we explain how these contracts work. For more about the pros and
cons of financing through the seller and the nitty gritty of how to
harness the power of seller financing, check out Chapter 12.
Lease options
A lease option agreement is sort of a rent-to-own deal. You rent the
property from the owner for a fixed period (usually no more than a
few years), at the end of which time you have the option to buy the
property. Normally, the seller requires some sort of down payment
(often less than a typical mortgage lender requires), which should
be applied to the purchase price, along with monthly rent equiva-
lent to about 1 percent of the purchase price.
A lease option agreement can be a great way to finance the pur-
chase of an investment property, assuming you’re working with a
seller who deals aboveboard, and you have a great plan in place
for obtaining cash or alternative financing by the time your option
to buy the property rolls around.
So how does a lease option work? The monthly payment consists
of rent plus some additional money that’s applied to the purchase
price. In other words, if the going rate for rent on the property is
$1,000 per month, you may have a monthly payment of, say, $1,500
with the extra $500 being added to your down payment. This
ensures that you’re building equity in the property during the lease
part of the agreement, and it provides the seller/lender with some
security in the event that you back out of the deal.
Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 73

Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
74
Make sure that the lease option agreement is very specific regard-
ing the application of payments and terms of exercising your
option. Otherwise, you may lose a lot of money in rent that you
assumed was being applied to the purchase price or lose your
option to buy on some minor technicality. Have a qualified real
estate attorney look over the agreement before you sign it, and
make sure you understand it completely.
Land contracts
With a land contract (also called a contract for deed), the seller
essentially functions as a bank, so you’re cutting out the middle-
man. In most cases, you handle the transaction through a rep-
utable escrow company. The deed is held in escrow, and you make
payments to the escrow company. When you’ve finally paid the
loan in full, the escrow company releases the deed to you.
Land contracts are often win-win situations, benefiting both the
seller and the investor:
 The seller profits not only from the sale of the property but
also from the interest the buyer is paying. They earn invest-
ment income generated by an asset they know and love —
their own real estate.
 The investor benefits by not having to pay a lot in closing
costs and being able to obtain a loan without having to jump
through hoops for a bank or mortgage company. With the
increased cash flow, an investor can obtain more properties
by using this strategy.
Make absolutely sure that payments are handled by a servicing
company — not by the seller — and that the deed is placed into
escrow. The last thing you want is to make payments for seven
years, only to find out that the underlying mortgage wasn’t paid,
the property has a tax lien against it, and the seller is nowhere to
be found to sign off on the deed! Been there, done that, not going
back for seconds.
Teaming Up with a 
Cash-Heavy Partner
Successful partnerships begin with individuals whose needs and
offerings complement one another — in other words, when one
partner has what the other needs, and vice versa. People who have
plenty of cash often don’t have plenty of time, talent, and motivation

to purchase, renovate, and manage real estate, and they really don’t
have to — they can hire someone else to do it for them. This is
where you come in as an investor. You have (or should have) the
know-how. All you need is the money.
In the following sections, we introduce you to various ways to
structure a partnership that typically work well in real estate. In
Chapter 13, we go a little deeper to show you how to partner with
the right individual(s).
Opting for a limited partnership
A limited partnership is called “limited” for a very good reason —
the liability protection (none) and tax benefits (insignificant) of a
partnership are very limited. Legal actions against one partner can
lead to actions against all partners, and each partner can be held
personally liable for actions of the partnership as a group. In other
words, if you’re going to partner up with someone, you really need
to form the partnership inside the protective bubble of a corpora-
tion, as discussed in the following section.
Limited partnerships do offer a few benefits. They’re
 Easy to set up
 Inexpensive
 Simple to manage for the few involved parties
You can set up a limited partnership with two or more people
(including yourself) on a per-property basis or to invest in multiple
properties. Just make sure you have all the terms of the partnership
in writing. The agreement should address the following three areas:
 Partner responsibilities: Spell out what each partner is
responsible for — supplying capital, finding and buying real
estate, making repairs and renovations, marketing and selling
the property, and so on.
 Profit sharing: Specify how profits from the real estate ven-
tures are going to be split.
 Dissolution: Stipulate how you’re going to divide any cash
and other assets if you decide to dissolve the partnership
later. Yeah, we know — when forming a partnership, the last
thing you want to think about is the possibility that it will end,
but it’s better to come to an agreement now when you’re
friends than later when you’re at each others’ throats (hope-
fully, that doesn’t happen).
Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 75

Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 
76
Have an attorney draw up the partnership agreement and explain
the terms to everyone involved. Each partner should have his own
legal representation to ensure that his interests are protected.
If you’re forming a corporation, a partnership agreement is still
very useful in clarifying each partner’s responsibilities. If you
decide not to use a written agreement, at least make sure that your
corporation papers clearly explain how distributions will be
applied — usually determined by shareholder percentage of own-
ership and disclosed on the K-1 (the tax schedule showing the total
annual payments, deductions, and credits to the shareholder).
Going the corporation route
Even if you happen to form a partnership with one or more other
individuals, managing your partnership as a corporation offers
additional benefits in terms of taxes and liability protection. You
have three options here:
 LLC: A limited liability corporation (LLC) limits your exposure
to risk. If someone takes legal action against the corporation,
your personal assets are protected. For most investors, we
recommend forming an LLC, as discussed in Chapter 2.
 Sub-S corp: A Sub-S corp (short for Subchapter S corporation)
also limits your exposure to risks and allows for pass-through
taxation (unlike a C-corp). With pass-through taxation, the cor-
poration’s profits pass through to your individual income tax
return, avoiding double-taxation (in which both you and your
corporation are taxed). Only individuals, not other business
entities, can own a Sub-S corp, and the corporation can have a
maximum of 75 shareholders. With a Sub-S, you run the risk of
the IRS forcing it into C-corp status (described in the following
bullet) if the corporation shows as having too much passive
income (income you don’t really do anything to earn, such as
rental income, that’s taxed at a lower rate than earned income).
 C-corp: A C-corp (short for Chapter C corporation) also limits
your personal liability, but we don’t recommend going the C-
corp route for most real estate investors. First, you need to
have at least 75 shareholders or establish a real estate invest-
ment trust (REIT), as discussed in Chapter 2. A C-corp also
exposes you to double-taxation, which can really take a bite
out of your profits.
A Sub-S corporation is simple to establish and file for, but make
sure to file for the Sub-S election with the IRS right away after form-
ing the corporation. For more about forming and managing a cor-
poration, check out Incorporating Your Business For Dummies by
The Company Corporation (Wiley).

Financing the
Purchase of
Residential Properties

In this part . . .
W
hen most folks buy a home, they’re usually best off
to look for a 30-year ﬁxed-rate mortgage that keeps
their payments low and steady and allows them to pay off
the loan in a reasonable amount of time. When you’re
ﬁnancing real estate investments, however, cash ﬂow
becomes much more important. You usually want to use as
little of your own money as possible, so you have cash on
hand to cover other investments and unexpected expenses.
This part gives you the tools to secure the ﬁnancing you
need to start hunting for residential real estate investment
opportunities. In this part, we explore the many residential
loan programs currently available, show you how to com-
pare different loan packages to ﬁnd the one that costs the
least overall, and lead you through the loan application
from ﬁlling out the forms to closing.

Finding the Residential Loan
Program That’s Right for You
In This Chapter
 Understanding why choosing the right loan is so crucial
 Focusing more on cash flow than on loan costs and interest
 Checking out what your government can do for you
 Dodging prepayment penalties
C
onsumers have hundreds of different residential loan programs
to choose from, including zero-down-payment programs, 40-
and 50-year terms, interest-only loans, and complicated adjustable-
rate mortgages that can double your payment overnight! In addition,
investors may have access to government financing through rehabil-
itation loans, renaissance loans, and even grants for redevelopment.
With so many types of loans and other financing to choose from,
how do you pick the type that’s best for you as an investor?
This chapter introduces you to the most common residential loan
types, explains how each program works, and guides you in choos-
ing the right type of loan for your investment needs.
The market is in constant flux, so new mortgage programs are con-
stantly being introduced while obsolete programs are being phased
out. In writing this chapter, we’ve tried our best to provide informa-
tion that’s detailed enough to be useful, but general enough to
accommodate market changes.
Understanding Why Finding the
Right Residential Loan Is Key
You’re not the only one who wants to earn a buck off real estate.
Lenders want to earn their keep, too, so they charge all sorts of

interest, fees, and penalties. As an investor working through one of
these lenders, you have two primary goals:
 Gain access to cash. You need cash to do deals. Check out the
following section, “Choosing a Loan Type to Maximize Your
Cash Flow” for more information.
 Pay as little as possible for access to that cash. After all, the
more you pay in interest, fees, and penalties, the less money
you walk away with at the end of the day.
In order to meet these two goals, you want to locate the right resi-
dential loan. To help you know what’s available, throughout this
chapter we roll out a veritable smorgasbord of loan types so you
can home in on the type that sounds best for a particular deal.
Another key to locating the right loan is to examine all the pros
and cons of each available loan before making a selection. We
cover this important step in Chapter 6.
When searching for the right residential loan, you also need to know
the difference between residential and commercial loans. Residential
mortgage loans finance the purchase of properties that people live
in — single-family homes, multifamily dwellings, apartment buildings,
condos, and co-ops. Commercial loans finance the purchase of prop-
erties that house businesses. With residential loans, lenders typically
examine the ability of the borrower to make payments and eventually
pay back the loan. With commercial properties, lenders give more
weight to the building’s ability to produce sufficient income. (See Part
III for more about financing the purchase of commercial properties.)
Choosing a Loan Type to Maximize
Your Cash Flow
When most folks buy a home to live in, the main ingredients they’re
looking at in a mortgage loan are interest rate, term (number of years
to pay off the loan), and monthly payment. They want a monthly
mortgage payment they can afford without paying an exorbitant
amount of interest over the life of the loan.
As an investor, your needs are different. Your primary goal is to gain
access to cash, even if you have to pay more to gain that access.
The interest rate, terms, and payment matter only as they relate to
your all-important cash flow. As a result, the criteria you use for
comparing loans are likely to differ a great deal from the criteria
you use to select a mortgage for a primary residence.

Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 

We toss the term cash flow around quite a bit and even use it as a
verb, as in “Wow, this property really cash flows!” So what is cash
flow, exactly? Cash flow simply means that the property is bringing
in more cash than is going out each month. If your property is losing
money, it has a negative cash flow . . . and you have problems.
When you’re more focused on gaining access to financing than
worrying about the cost of financing, your options suddenly multi-
ply. You can begin to consider loans that you would otherwise dis-
miss outright as costing too much. In addition, you can begin to
explore a host of options that aren’t available to the average home-
owner, such as rehabilitation loans.
In the following sections, we show you how cash flow enables you
to leverage the power of using other people’s money to finance
your investments and introduce you to a few types of loans that
can maximize the cash you have available for investments.
The power of OPM (other 
people’s money)
One of the secrets to maximizing your investment profits is to use
as little of your own money and as much of other people’s money
(OPM) as possible. By using OPM, you stretch your investment
dollar — you can buy more and better properties and increase
your profit potential as a result.
Whenever you finance the purchase of a property, rather than paying
cash with your own money, you’re using OPM. Throughout this book,
we reveal various sources of OPM, including bank loans, government-
secured loans, hard-money lenders, small-business loans, and so on.
We introduce the concept of OPM here, so you have a better under-
standing of why you want to borrow money (rather than using all
your own money) to purchase real estate. After you grasp the 
concept of OPM and understand the leverage it gives you, you’re
better prepared to begin evaluating the sources of OPM.
The magic of using OPM is in the numbers, as the following 
examples reveal:
 You invest $100,000 cash to buy, renovate, and sell a house for
$120,000. You just made a 20 percent profit ($20,000 profit
divided by your investment of $100,000 equals 20 percent).
 You invest $20,000, borrowing the other $80,000 to buy, reno-
vate, and sell a house for $120,000. You just made a 100 percent
profit ($20,000 profit divided by your investment of $20,000
equals 100 percent).
Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 81

In these examples, you earn five times more profit percentage-wise
by using other people’s money, even though you earn the same
profit in terms of dollar amount. You may argue that you still end
up with $20,000 in your pocket either way. But say you have $100,000
to invest, as in the first example. Instead of buying one property with
$100,000, you can divvy it up into $20,000 chunks to buy five $100,000
properties (borrowing $80,000 for each). You now control $1,000,000
worth of real estate and when you sell the properties, you earn
$20,000 each for a total profit of $100,000!
Borrowing money is always risky, but you have to take some risk.
Throughout this book, we show you ways to reduce the risk, but
unforeseen events can undermine the best-laid plans. As a real
estate investor, you need to decide for yourself whether the poten-
tial benefits outweigh the risks.
The following sections reveal some loan types that can free up
more of your own money and maximize the use of OPM.
Interest-only mortgages
An interest-only loan is just what it sounds like; if you take out an
interest-only loan for $100,000, in two years, after making 24 interest-
only payments, you still owe $100,000. Sound like a bum deal?
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
82
Did I overpay for that loan?
Several years ago, I (Chip) obtained a mortgage for a two-family duplex at 9.50 per-
cent interest, and paid 3 points to get it. The market rate for mortgages was about
6 percent at the time, and qualified home buyers were usually able to secure a mort-
gage without paying any points. Most people would have thought I was crazy.
Was I?
Crazy like a fox, maybe. I needed a loan to purchase an investment property, and
because the property had been severely neglected and in disrepair, the type of loan
I needed wasn’t readily available in the marketplace. Without cash, I couldn’t do the
deal, so I was willing to pay a premium to gain access to the cash I needed. It was just
a short-term solution until I could make some repairs to the point that the property
became eligible for more-conventional (and less-expensive) financing. But the cash
flow made it very attractive (and profitable) — even at the higher interest rate.
When financing real estate investments, you have to remember to stop thinking like
an average homeowner and start thinking like an investor. Put your investor cap on
when examining the terms and make sure the cash flow works for the property
you’re planning on buying.

It may be, if you plan on living in your home for 15 years and the
value of the home doesn’t appreciate significantly. But if you’re
using the loan for a quick flip, it may be perfect. You pay off the loan
in full right after you sell the house. In the meantime, you have more
investment capital to put toward renovations or other properties.
The key to using interest-only loans wisely is in making sure the
property provides a positive cash flow — enough revenue to more
than cover all your costs, including the monthly interest you’re
paying, and the value of the property is stable or rising. When 
considering interest-only loans, be aware of the following:
 Most interest-only loans are adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs),
so carefully check the adjustment period, index, margin, and
cap. (For more about ARMs, check out the following section.)
 Rarely is an interest-only loan interest-only for the life of the
loan. Read the fine print to determine when and how you
must pay the principle. Some loans require a lump-sum pay-
ment three to five years down the road. They suck you in with
low monthly payments early and then sock you with huge bills
later. This fake-out may be devastating to the average home-
owner, but if you know about it and plan for it, an interest-only
loan can be your ticket to a profitable investment property.
Nobody can judge a loan type as good or bad without considering
how the investor uses the loan to finance the investment. If a no-
interest loan frees up some cash so you can complete the repairs
and renovations on a property more quickly, the fact that your
entire payment was going only toward interest matters very little.
Grabbing a hold of ARMs
Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) have interest rates that fluctu-
ate. You may take out a loan for 5 percent and find yourself paying
8 percent the following year. Even so, ARMs can play a valuable
role in your investment strategy. They’re often easier to qualify for,
and if you can sell the property or refinance the loan before the
rate jumps, you may be able to avoid any huge increases in interest
and payments.
As was revealed during the great foreclosure crisis that began in
2008, ARMs are risky business for most homeowners. Tight credit
can undermine your plans to sell or refinance. In the meantime,
your monthly payment increases could make the property un-
affordable. Realize that when you take out an ARM, you’re taking a
gamble. To minimize your exposure to risk, figure out the worst-
case scenario and plan accordingly.
Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 83

When shopping for ARMs, examine the following factors to deter-
mine the worst-case scenario:
 Initial interest rate: The interest rate when you sign for the
loan. This is usually a teaser rate to make the initial payments
more attractive.
 Adjustment period: The frequency at which the rate can go
up or down. This is typically one, three, or five years but can
also be months rather than years.
 Index: ARMs are tied to an index that typically rises or falls
based on government lending rates. Ask which index the lender
uses, how often it changes, and how it has performed in the
past. Several indexes are considered standard, including the
Treasury index, the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
the Cost of Funds Index (COFI), the Prime Rate, various T-Bills,
and the Fed Funds Rate.
The Treasury index is always a little safer and secure and is the
most common. Take some time to look up whatever index your
lender uses, and make sure you can find it in The Wall Street
Journal (the financial rates section) or a similar publication.
 Margin: The percentage above the index that the lender
charges — think of it as a markup. For example, if the index 
is at 3 percent and the margin is 2 percent, you pay 5 percent
interest. If the index rises two percentage points to 5 percent, you
pay 7 percent interest. The margin remains the same through-
out the life of the mortgage.
 Cap: The highest interest rate the lender can charge, no matter
how high the index rises. So if the lender sets the cap at 9 per-
cent, you never pay more than 9 percent interest, no matter
how high the index goes. The lender likely will quote a yearly
cap and a lifetime cap as, for example, “2/6”, which means the
rate can go up 2 percent per year (or per adjustment), and 
6 percent over the life of the loan.
Make sure you understand all the possible adjustments that can
take place and calculate the payments under a worst-case sce-
nario. Plug this number into your pro forma calculations (your pro-
jections) to make sure that your property will still cash flow under
the worst of circumstances. We can’t stress enough the need to do
your homework, and possibly consult your highly qualified and
trusted mortgage broker before selecting an ARM.

Hybrids
A hybrid loan is a combination of an ARM and a fixed-rate loan.
With a hybrid term, the interest rate remains fixed for a certain
number of years, after which time the rate is adjustable. For exam-
ple, with a 3/1 hybrid, the interest rate remains fixed for 3 years
and then becomes an adjustable-rate loan in which the rate can be
adjusted every year. A 2/28 hybrid has a fixed interest rate for the
first 2 years and then adjusts each year for the next 28 years.
These types of loans are better suited for situations in which you
plan on holding the property for at least a couple of years before
selling it and you’re fairly certain that interest rates won’t drop
over the next couple years. If you’re planning on selling the prop-
erty quickly, an adjustable rate mortgage with a low introductory
interest rate may be a better choice. (See the previous section for
more on adjustable rate mortgages.) On the other hand, if you plan
on holding the property for longer than a couple of years, a fixed-
rate mortgage may be more appealing.
The main advantage of a hybrid over a straight ARM is that it pro-
vides, at least for a time, a guaranteed fixed interest rate, which
can help you establish more reliable cash flow projections for the
duration of the fixed-interest term. You still need to be careful,
however; hybrid loans can turn into time bombs if your projections
are based on unrealistic assumptions. An unexpectedly steep jump
in the interest rate can quickly create a negative cash flow.
Hard-money loans: Private investors
When easy money is unavailable (money from financial institu-
tions), you can always turn to hard-money lenders — private
investors who offer loans that typically charge several points
upfront, use higher-than-average interest rates, and require pay-
ment in full after only a few years.
Why would any investor in her right mind even consider a hard-
money loan? Because you gotta have cash to do a deal, and some-
times hard money is the only money you can get your hands on.
For more about financing your real estate investments with hard
money, turn to Chapter 11.
Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 85

Taking Advantage of Government-
Secured Loans
You may be able to hit up your rich Uncle Sam for a loan to finance
your real estate investments (refer to Chapter 4 for more on how
government loans work). Although the government rarely loans
money directly, especially to investors, it often secures loans so
lending institutions can make the money available without exposing
themselves to huge risks. (If a borrower defaults on a government-
secured loan, the government pays the difference and sells the
home to recoup at least part of its loss.)
Although many government loans are available only to finance 
the purchase of owner-occupied properties (properties that the
borrower/homeowner is going to live in), in some cases you can
also use these programs to finance the purchase, repairs, and 
renovations of investment properties.
In the following sections, we describe a host of government pro-
grams that may be available to you depending on your investment
strategy and the property you’re planning to purchase. We 
also show you how to go about tapping into these government-
sponsored resources.
Tapping the FHA for a loan
Although the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) works with mort-
gage lenders to make loans available primarily to first-time home
buyers, some FHA programs are open to investors. These loans can
directly benefit you by providing government-secured financing for
investment properties, especially if you’re investing in residential
real estate and multifamily housing. The FHA is the federal govern-
ment’s way of promoting the American Dream of homeownership.
As an investor, these programs can also benefit you indirectly —
you can often use FHA loans to assist prospective buyers in financ-
ing the purchase of an investment property you’re selling. One of
the biggest obstacles preventing first-time buyers from purchasing
a home is their inability to qualify for a conventional mortgage.
FHA loans make qualifying much easier for them.
If you’re working with a well-qualified mortgage broker (see
Chapter 4) who has experience working with investors, she can
direct you to FHA loan programs that you may be able to qualify
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
86

for as an investor. The same is true if you’re working directly with a
lender who handles FHA loans.
To get more information about FHA loans and other programs
straight from the source, visit the FHA Web site at www.fha.gov,
where you can find information about the Good Neighbor Next
Door program (described in Chapter 4), special loans for financing
the development of multifamily housing and medical centers,
streamlined FHA mortgages, 203(k) loans, and much more.
If you decide to sell a property you own, you can often attract
more buyers if you advertise that you accept FHA financing. Also
offer to put prospective buyers in touch with your mortgage broker,
who can help them determine whether they qualify for an FHA loan.
In addition to helping the buyers, your broker can screen out any
looky-loos (casual browsers) who may not be able to afford the
property.
If you’re looking to invest in residential real estate, you may be
able to turn to one of the following FHA loans. Check carefully
(your lender or broker can assist you) because they have strict
guidelines.
FHA 203(b) loans
FHA 203 loans are designed for first-time homebuyers and people
who don’t have a lot of money for a down payment. Investors can
utilize these loans to help their potential buyers finance the pur-
chase of their residential real estate, or to acquire and occupy a
multifamily property. (You’d have to occupy at least one of the
units in a multifamily property.) During the writing of this book,
FHA 203b loans
 Are available only for owner-occupied, one- to four-family
homes
 Allow borrowers to obtain a loan for up to 96.5 percent loan-
to-value (LTV), meaning they can purchase a home with a
down payment of as little as 3.5 percent of the property’s
market value
 Are assumable for a new purchaser, meaning the owner can
get out from under the loan by arranging to have a buyer pick
up the payments
FHA offers another program that you may find useful as an investor:
streamline refinancing. This program enables you to lower your
interest rate on a previous FHA loan with low or no out-of-pocket
costs faster and with less documentation than most other refinance
loans. For example, if you purchased a home with a $100,000 FHA
Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 87

loan as a home buyer a couple of years ago, moved out, and now
use the home as an investment property, you may be able to refi-
nance at a lower interest rate through this program. Even better,
you can refinance all the way back up to the original loan amount
(about $100,000 in this example) without obtaining a new appraisal,
and roll all costs into the new loan — including any points you may
pay to lower the rate.
Title I loans
Title I loans are available only for owner-occupied properties to
enable homeowners to finance the cost of repairs and renovations
up to $25,000.
Title I loans are great for investors who want to flip the property
they’re living in but don’t have the cash on hand to bring the prop-
erty up to market conditions. In a situation like this, you can use
the Title I loan in either of the following ways:
 Take out the Title I loan yourself to pay for repairs and 
renovations before placing the property on the market.
 Place the home on the market as is (at a lower asking price)
and let potential buyers know about the Title I loan they can
take out to cover the cost of repairs and renovations after
they take possession.
FHA 203(k) loans
FHA 203(k) loans are similar to Title I loans in that they’re avail-
able only for owner-occupied properties and they allow the owner
to finance the cost of repairs and renovations. The difference is
that 203(k) loans allow the cost of major repairs to be combined
with the purchase price of the property.
This program is ideal for investors who want to purchase a property,
live in it while they’re making repairs and renovations, and then sell
it. Just make sure you don’t overimprove the property and improve
yourself right out of a profit. Also, your intent has to be to live in the
house for at least 12 months as a primary residence.
For example, if a home is worth $100,000 now but would be worth
$150,000 all fixed up, you can obtain an FHA 203(k) loan for the 
full $150,000 upfront, take your time completing the repairs and
renovations, and then sell the property after you’ve lived in it for
at least 12 months total.

Multifamily loans
For larger residential properties, FHA does offer a multifamily pro-
gram that allows investors to purchase and rehabilitate apartment
complex–type properties. You can often combine the FHA loan
with other government grants or subsidies for improvements, tax
credit, or rental payments such as the Section 8 program.
You can find out more about FHA programs for multifamily housing
through HUD’s Web site at www.hud.gov/groups/multifamily.cfm.
Viewing Veterans Affairs 
(VA) loans
As one of the perks for serving in the military, the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers veterans zero-down financing to pur-
chase owner-occupied one- to four-family properties. If you’re a
veteran, these loans are often the best deal in town. As an investor,
you can often leverage the power of VA financing when you decide
to sell a property — these loans give you access to another pool of
potential buyers.
Although VA loans are generally available only to veterans, even
investors who aren’t veterans can often obtain VA financing to pur-
chase foreclosure properties that the VA owns.
Any mortgage broker or lender who handles VA loans can assist
you in determining whether you qualify for one of the programs. Your
broker may also be able to work with any prospective buyers (if you
decide to sell the property) to determine whether they qualify for 
a VA loan, which may make the property more affordable to them.
For more about VA loans, visit the VA’s Web site at www.va.gov
and then click “Benefits, Home Loans.”
Considering REO loans
Real Estate Owned (REO) property is typically property repos-
sessed by the bank after foreclosure. The bank now has to sell the
property to recoup the remaining portion of the unpaid debt. With
government-secured (FHA and VA) loans, the government agency
that secured the loan gets stuck with the property.
Ideally, the government or bank that owns the REO wants someone
to show up with cash and buy the property, but sometimes eager
cash-heavy investors are few and far between. To add a little extra
Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 89

motivation, the owner of the REO property may offer to finance its
purchase, sometimes offering very attractive deals and perhaps
even the ever-elusive no-money down deal. These deals can be
ideal for an investor because you can pick up the property at a
great price and secure attractive financing in one fell swoop.
To obtain an REO loan, first find one or more properties that you
want to purchase from a bank or government agency and then con-
tact that agency and ask whether it’s willing to finance the purchase.
Experienced investors who have a proven track record of getting
(and keeping) bad loans off the books have a better chance of
obtaining this sort of financing. After all, the government or bank
doesn’t want to have to foreclose on the same property again.
For more in-depth information about REOs, check out our book
Foreclosure Investing For Dummies (Wiley).
One of the best times to pursue REO’s is when the housing market
is in a slump and foreclosures are on the rise, as we discuss in
Chapter 17.
Tapping into state and 
local grants and loans
State and local governments often identify certain target areas
(such as rundown downtown districts, renaissance zones, and
other areas in need of a pick-me-up) for redevelopment. They then
offer incentives — usually in the form of state or local grants or low-
interest loans — to get investors like you involved in pitching in.
State and local grant and loan programs rarely get you all the
money you need to purchase and rehab a property. They’re
intended as add-on programs, typically used in conjunction with
other loans. Here we describe the most common types of state and
local programs you’re likely to find:
 State housing development authorities: Meant to encourage
redevelopment in areas like Detroit or areas hit by disasters
such as hurricanes, state housing development authorities
often sell bonds to make money available to both homeown-
ers and investors. They also fund special first-time home
buyer programs and foreclosure rescue grant programs.
 Renaissance zones: Great for investors, renaissance zones are
areas that federal, state, and/or local governments have
declared tax-free (or tax-lite) to encourage development. In
these zones, investors can secure loans with significantly
lower monthly payments, sometimes saving hundreds or
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
90

thousands of dollars per month. It’s like getting an interest-
free loan, which dramatically increases your cash flow.
 Economic development department: To encourage develop-
ment within certain areas, many larger cities have economic
development departments that provide tax breaks, invest-
ment funding, capital expansion funds, construction, or reha-
bilitation grants to projects within their district.
 Grants and specific use loans: States, local governments, and
some nonprofit agencies often provide loans or grants for
improvement projects — such as health care facilities,
women’s shelters, and emergency housing — designed to add
value to specific areas.
If your property is located in an area flagged for development or
meets the state or local program’s criteria, contact the state hous-
ing development authority, the city housing agency, and any non-
profit housing agencies to find out about available funds and what
you need to do to qualify.
Start researching at the top — HUD’s Web site at www.hud.gov. Here
you can search for information by state, find out about economic
development programs and grants, type in the address of a property
to determine whether it’s located in an enterprise zone, and dis-
cover other community networks and programs that can assist you
in rebuilding communities while earning a profit for yourself.
To find state-level programs, head to your state’s housing authority
Web site. To find it, use your favorite Web search tool to search for
your state’s name followed by “housing authority.” Your county,
city, or town may also have its own housing authority, so use the
same strategy to search for it. The Public Housing Directors
Association (PHDA) also has a directory of members, which you
can access by visiting www.phada.org and clicking the “Housing
Authority Websites” link.
Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 91
REO financing in action
The first foreclosure I (Chip) ever purchased was a vacant two-family dwelling,
which I bought for $500 down and simply had to pay the balance of the previous
loan. The seller, the Bank of Florida, financed the purchase over a five-year term. No
qualifying, no closing costs!
We can’t guarantee that a bank or government agency will be willing to finance the
purchase for you, but it’s certainly worth a try. You never know if you never ask.

Many mortgage brokers who are approved by their State Housing
Development Authority can also provide valuable assistance.
Digging up USDA Rural
Development loans
To encourage development of rural areas the USDA offers its own
financing through Business and Industry (B&I) loans, discussed in
Chapter 9, and rural development (RD) loans. As an investor, you
don’t qualify for the RD loans designed for residential home
buyers, but these loans can benefit you indirectly if you buy and
sell property in rural areas. Prospective buyers who can’t obtain
financing elsewhere may qualify for an RD loan.
For more about USDA loan programs to encourage rural develop-
ment, visit www.rurdev.usda.gov/rd/index.html.
Avoiding the Prepayment 
Penalty Trap
When a bank loans you money for 30 years, it’s counting on the
fact that you’re going to be paying interest to them for a long time.
They have invested a certain amount of time and energy in origi-
nating that loan and need time to be able to make a profit off their
investment (just like you do). The bank also doesn’t want you refi-
nancing with another bank a year or two down the road and cut-
ting them out of the deal.
To discourage you from refinancing, and to help keep their initial
costs low, the bank may try to slip a prepayment penalty clause into
your mortgage. With this clause, if you refinance and try to pay off
the loan early, you have to pay a stiff penalty — sometimes thou-
sands of dollars.
When shopping for mortgages, be sure to ask whether the mortgage
loan has any prepayment penalties and then read the mortgage
carefully before signing it. Prepayment penalties typically apply for
up to the first three years of the loan but can extend to longer peri-
ods on larger investment properties. If you have to refinance later,
you don’t want a prepayment penalty getting in the way.

W
hether you’re borrowing money to buy a place to live in or
invest in, you’re not just buying real estate — you’re also
buying money to finance the purchase. You’re a consumer buying a
product — in this case, a loan program — and you need to compare
costs and benefits just as you do when you make any major 
purchasing decision.
Your goal is to find a loan that costs you the least amount of money
over the life of the loan and requires monthly payments that you
can afford and that ensure positive cash flows (as discussed in
Chapter 5). The monthly payment part is fairly easy to figure out —
lenders have to tell you what your monthly payments are going to
be upfront. Determining how much it will cost you over the life of
the loan, however, is a little trickier.
In this chapter, we show you how to shop for loans to find the one
that costs the least and is best suited to your investment goals.
Understanding How This 
Interest Thing Works
Banks and other lenders primarily earn their money by charging
interest on loans — a certain percentage of the principal owed on
the loan (principal is the amount you owe on the loan). Well, that’s

certainly easy enough to understand, especially if you’ve pur-
chased any big ticket item like a car or a house on credit.
In practice, however, interest can get pretty complicated. Lenders
may choose to collect interest upfront in points, calculate your
rate as simple interest, amortize the loan, or even play a game of
“moving target” by adjusting the interest rate over the life of the
loan. In the following sections, we sort out the complexities that
surround interest rates and explain the essential jargon you’re
likely to encounter in plain English.
Keeping simple with simple interest
Simple interest is simple because you can usually calculate the
amount of interest you need to pay in your head or with a very
basic calculator. The formula goes like this:
Principal × Interest Rate = Annual Interest
You can then calculate your monthly interest by dividing by 12:
Annual Interest ÷ 12 Months Per Year = Monthly Interest
For example, say you borrow $100,000 at 8 percent interest:
$100,000 × .08 = $8,000 interest per year
$8,000 ÷ 12 = $666.67 interest per month
Because the formulas calculate only the interest owed on the loan,
simple interest is perfect for interest-only loans. (Check out Chapter 5
for the ins and outs of interest-only loans.) Unless you’re dealing
with interest-only loans or smaller loans, such as home equity loans
or lines of credit, you’re unlikely to encounter simple interest. Most
loans use more complicated methods to calculate interest.
Grasping the concept of amortization
If you ever looked at an amortization table or tried to set up your
own spreadsheet to calculate amortization, you probably ended up
bleary-eyed from trying to figure out how anyone could possibly
have devised such a convoluted system for calculating house pay-
ments. Amortization is a method for calculating the retirement of
debt that applies significantly higher portions of early payments
toward interest and significantly higher portions of later payments
to pay down the principal.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
94

The mathematicians who devised this system had a method to their
madness. They were attempting to create a system to provide for
constant loan payments over a fixed period. The system also had to
account for interest on the loan and the fact that each payment
reduces the principal owed on the loan, which ultimately results in
extinguishing the loan. In other words, they set some lofty goals.
Explaining how amortization works in theory is way too compli-
cated, so consider the following example: Say you owe $100,000 at
8 percent interest over a 30-year term. The following steps show
you how to calculate amortization and determine the amount of
interest due for each payment:
1. Determine the total monthly payment due.
This step is the most mathematically complicated. To figure
your payment, plug the numbers into the following formula:

A is the total monthly payment, i is the periodic interest
rate, P is the principal, and n is the number of periods (pay-
ments over the life of the loan). The periodic interest rate is
the annual interest rate divided by 12 months. The number
of periods is the number of years times 12 months.
Using this formula, your monthly payment on a $100,000 at
8 percent interest over a 30-year term comes to $733.76.
Yep, this is why everyone uses a loan calculator or a spread-
sheet instead of doing the math by hand, but we think you
should know where the numbers are coming from.
2. Calculate how much of the payment is interest by using
the same formula you use to calculate simple interest.
Your payment consists of interest plus a reduction in the
loan balance (principal). Here’s that formula:
Principal × Interest Rate ÷ 12 = Monthly Interest
So, in this example, your interest on your first payment is
$666.67: $100,000 × .08 ÷ 12 = $666.67
3. Subtract your interest payment from your total payment
to figure out how much principal you pay off.
Your first monthly payment of $733.76 breaks down like this:
Total payment of $733.76 – $666.67 in interest = $67.09 of
principal.

4. For the next payment, subtract the amount you paid
toward the principal from the total.
$100,000 – $67.09 = $99,932.91, so this figure is the number
you use when you figure your next payment.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 for each subsequent payment.
Based on the calculation in Step 4, the interest portion of
your second payment is $666.22:
$99,932.91 × .08 ÷ 12 = $666.22
With this payment, $67.54 goes toward principal, and with
each subsequent payment you end up paying more toward
the principal and less toward interest. This pattern continues
until the entire balance is paid off in 360 months (30 years).
If you have Microsoft Excel, select File➪New and check the tem-
plates on your computer to determine whether your version of
Excel comes with an amortization schedule. If it does, you can click
it and click OK to create a new loan amortization schedule. Just
plug in the loan amount, term, and interest rate, and Excel does the
rest. If your version of Excel has no amortization template, you can
download a free one and other real estate finance–related templates
from Microsoft’s Office Web site. Go to office.microsoft.com,
click the Templates tab, click in the search box, type “amortiza-
tion,” and press Enter. You have several results to choose from.
Telling the difference between 
the interest rate and APR
Most people know that the interest rate and the annual percentage
rate (APR) differ, but few people understand how they differ. The
interest rate reflects the simple cost of the money you’re borrowing.
The APR is designed to reflect the total cost of the loan, including
any loan origination fees and prepaid costs. As a result, the APR is
higher than the simple interest rate.
Why use an APR? Congress designed the system back in 1974 as a
way to enable consumers to more easily compare the actual costs
associated with the loans. It sort of functions as a consumer pro-
tection tool, helping borrowers compare apples to apples in the
world of personal finance.
For example, say you came into my (Chip’s) office and I quoted you
a 30-year mortgage loan for $200,000 at 6.50 percent. You talk to
another loan officer who offers you the same deal at 6.25 percent.
On the surface, you think this is a no-brainer — paying one-quarter
percentage point less is going to save you money over the life of
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
96

the loan. However, what if I’m charging zero points (points are pre-
paid interest; see “Paying interest upfront with points” later in this
chapter), and this other guy is charging three points (in this case,
$6,000)? Now it’s not such a no-brainer.
Which deal is better? All other factors (loan origination fees and
any other costs) being equal, mine is, and you can quickly see by
looking at the APR:
 APR on 30-year fixed mortgage $200,000 at 6.50 percent with
zero points: 6.5 percent.
 APR on a 30-year fixed mortgage $200,000 at 6.25 percent with
three points: 6.626 percent.
What makes my deal even more attractive is that if you were to pay
off the loan in less than 30 years (highly common, especially for
investors), you’d save the $6,000 you would have paid in points to
the other guy.
You can find several APR calculators on the Web by searching for, you
guessed it, “APR calculator.” One of our favorites is at mortgages.

Exploring how adjustable 
rate mortgages work
Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) are mortgage loans with interest
rates that can fluctuate (rise or fall). During the mortgage meltdown,
many unsuspecting homeowners got burned by ARMs they probably
never should have been placed into. Although this has given ARMs a
bad name, they’re actually very useful, particularly for investors, as
long as you use them strategically.
Not all ARMs are created equal, though. Several factors influence
the best-case and worst-case scenarios of how low or high the inter-
est rate can go, including the initial interest rate, the adjustment
period (how often adjustments can be made), the index (the base
interest rate you pay), the margin (the lender’s markup on the
index), and the cap (the highest rate the lender can charge). We
explain these factors in greater detail in Chapter 5.
For example, say you take out an ARM to purchase a property that
you’re almost certain you can renovate and sell within a year.
Taking out an ARM with a rate that stands to rise at the end of one
or two years could be a reasonable gamble. And if you can get the
ARM for a lower interest rate than the going rate for fixed-rate
mortgages, the ARM can actually save you quite a bit of money. 
Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 97

Of course, taking out an ARM always carries some risk. Being
“almost certain” you can sell the property within the year for more
than you have in it is no guarantee. Whenever you invest in any-
thing, you need to assess the risk/benefit ratio for yourself and
determine just how much risk you’re willing and able to take on.
Paying interest upfront with points
Plenty of lenders, particularly hard-money lenders, charge interest
upfront in the form of points. (Hard-money lenders are private
lenders; check out Chapter 11 for more on using these types of
lenders.) So what are points? One point is equivalent to 1 percent
of the total loan amount, so for every $100,000 you borrow, a point
costs you $1,000. A point on a $200,000 loan costs $2,000.
So why do lenders use points? Lenders typically charge points for
one of the following reasons:
 To lower the interest rate: When you choose to pay interest
upfront, the lender may reduce your interest rate, so you pay
less interest with each payment. 
 To get the money upfront: If you pay back the loan quickly, the
lender earns enough for taking the time to process your loan.
When you pay interest upfront to lower the interest rate, you may
not see a net savings for several years. You can calculate the break-
even point to determine whether you’ll actually save money by
paying upfront for a lower interest rate. The break-even point is the
payment period at which you’ve saved enough money with the
lower interest rate to pay the cost of the points:
1. Start with the cost of the points.
Two points on a $100,000 loan cost $2,000.
2. Determine your monthly savings per payment as a result
of the lower interest rate.
To do this, simply subtract the monthly payment at the
lower interest rate from the monthly payment at the higher
rate. In this example, assume you’re saving $50 per month.
3. Divide the cost of the points by the monthly savings.
In this example, you divide $2,000 by $50, which equals 40.
Your break-even point is at 40 months. If you plan on keeping
the property for more than 40 months, you’ll save money
paying points. If not, it costs you more to pay points.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
98

Of course, it gets more complicated when you take taxes into con-
sideration, but this gives you a general idea of how points work.
Another reason you may want to pay points is so you can qualify
for a larger loan, because the points you pay lower your monthly
payment. Does paying points make sense? That depends. Crunch
the numbers yourself. For example, a $100,000 loan at 7 percent
interest over 30 years with zero points requires a monthly payment
of $665.30. The same loan at 6 percent with 2 points would cost an
extra $2,000 upfront but lower the payment to $599.55 — a monthly
savings of $65.75. At that rate, breaking even on the upfront cost
would take just under 31 months, but the investor would likely be
able to claim a tax deduction for the costs, depending on his tax sit-
uation. In this case, paying points is an okay deal.
Although some people say they never pay points, and others rec-
ommend doing everything you can to lower the interest rate, points
really have no never or always. Sometimes you have to pay points
to gain access to the cash you need to do the deal, as we explain
in Chapter 5.
Considering the Mortgage Term
When investing in residential real estate and looking for a low-cost
loan, you need to take a close look at the mortgage term. A lender
often quotes the mortgage term in years; for example, you may
have a 15- or 30-year mortgage. However, for payment purposes
you calculate the term on a monthly basis — 12 payment periods
per year over 30 years equals a total of 360 months or payment
periods. A 15-year mortgage has 180 payment periods.
Understanding the term is important because it ultimately affects
how much money you end up paying for the loan over the life of
the loan. For your average homeowner, a shorter term can pay div-
idends. Pay off a $200,000 loan in 15 years rather than 30, and you
save a whopping $155,437.
However, as an investor, you have a different perspective. Investors
like longer terms because they increase a property’s cash flow, giving
them more cash to do more deals. For example, payments on that 15-
year mortgage would cost in excess of $467 more per month. That
would significantly reduce monthly profit on any rental property and
give you much less money to work with on other deals. Remember:
As an investor, the longer the term, the better.
Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 99

Accounting for Closing Costs
Every major newspaper has a financial section where banks, bro-
kers, and other lending companies post their interest rates and
often the points (prepaid interest) they’re currently charging.
Although this financial information gives you a general comparison
of the going rates, it really doesn’t help investors or home buyers
comparison shop. These figures usually don’t mention other costs
associated with the loan, such as the loan origination fee, discount
points, processing fees, paperwork fees, and junk fees. (For more
about junk fees, see “Forking over other fees” later in this chapter.)
When comparison shopping for loans, you need to take these fees
into account. In the following sections, we explain the most
common closing costs you’re likely to see.
Getting socked with origination fees
The loan origination fee is what the lender or broker charges you
as a service fee for processing your loan. They’re usually calcu-
lated the same way as points are — as a percentage of the total
loan amount and charged as a cost to the borrower. For example, a
1 percent loan origination fee is 1 percent of the total loan amount,
or $1,000 for every $100,000 you borrow.
Although most lenders charge a maximum of 1 percent, the loan
origination fee is always negotiable. Sometimes, all you need to do is
ask the loan officer to reduce the fee. In other cases, you may need
to mention that Julie Swanson on the other side of town is charging
less. For more tips on negotiating, check out Negotiating For
Dummies by Michael C. Donaldson and David Frohnmayer (Wiley).
Although you may not consider the loan origination fee part of the
loan, you should always include it in your calculations of the total
cost of the loan. This strategy enables you to more effectively 
comparison-shop for the best deal.
Forking over other fees
Points and loan origination fees are only a couple of the legitimate
expenses you can expect to see on a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) or
HUD-1 (see the next section). Other legitimate fees include the 
following:
 Appraisal fee
 Closing or escrow fee
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
100

 Credit report fee
 Flood certification fee
 Lender fee (negotiable)
 Recording fees
 Reserves for paying taxes or insurance
 State tax/stamps
 Title insurance
 Underwriting fee (negotiable)
Some lenders include a processing fee, which is fairly standard but
usually negotiable. (This fee covers the time and effort invested in
handling the paperwork, along with any copy or printing costs.)
You can usually figure out whether any of these fees is exorbitant
by comparing a few Good Faith Estimates from other lenders.
Although we like to think of brokers and bankers as being trust-
worthy professionals, some are less forthright than others and are
infamous for padding their closing fees with what the industry
calls junk fees. One time I (Chip) was surprised to find an “e-mail
fee” of $35 tacked onto my closing statement. Upon inquiry, I was
told that this amount was what the title company charged to e-mail
the documents over to the lender. How ridiculous! I was able to get
it removed in about 45 seconds. Here are some other more
common junk fees to watch out for:
Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 101
 Administration fee
 Affiliate consulting
fee
 Amortization fee
 Application fee
 Bank inspection fee
 Document 
preparation fee
 Document review fee
 Express mail fee
 Funding fee
 Lender’s attorney fee
 Lender’s inspection fee
 Messenger fee
 Notary fee
 Photograph fee
 Settlement fee
 Signup fee
 Translation fee
Junk fees can also be inflated costs of standard fees. If the going
rate for overnight fees is $75, for example, and one lender tries to
charge you $150, ask why.

Examining the Good Faith Estimate
By law, your broker or lender is required to provide you with a
detailed breakdown of all the costs associated with the loan (resi-
dential, not commercial loans). Lenders typically provide a Good
Faith Estimate prior to processing your residential loan application
and then a HUD-1 statement at closing detailing the actual final
costs. (The Good Faith Estimate is a list of projected costs to the
borrower, while the HUD-1 breaks down all the actual costs that the
seller and buyer are responsible for paying at closing.)
If the lender doesn’t provide a Good Faith Estimate upfront, ask for
one and make sure it’s legible and understandable. Some lenders
like to use fine print and shading to conceal what they’re really
charging and then give you a copy of the copy of the copy of the
faxed original to make it completely unreadable.
Costs, particularly the loan origination fee and points, shouldn’t
change dramatically from what’s on the Good Faith Estimate to
what you see on the HUD-1 at closing. If you notice any change,
bring it up at the closing table and don’t sign the papers until any
issues are resolved to your satisfaction and in writing. See Chapter 7
for more about covering your back at closing.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
102
Are Good Faith Estimates standardized?
When you start shopping for loans, you’re likely to see all sorts of Good Faith
Estimates, each of which categorizes its expenses differently and assigns each
expense a different name. All these differences can make it difficult, if not impossi-
ble, to compare estimated closing costs.
Fortunately, the federal government is stepping up to deal with this issue. On
November 12, 2008, HUD announced several new mortgage rules to help consumers
shop for lower-cost home loans. One of the new rules requires that starting on
January 1, 2010, lenders use a standardized GFE. The new three-page GFE benefits
borrowers in two ways:
 When all lenders start using the form, the standardized model enables borrow-
ers to compare costs line by line without having to decipher different names for
the same charges.
 The new GFE contains line-item references to the same amounts on the HUD-1,
making it easier to spot any changes between the estimated charges on the
GFE and the actual charges on the HUD-1 at closing.

Calculating a Loan’s Total Cost
Your bank or mortgage broker is likely to lay out a virtual buffet of
loan types for you to choose from: fixed-interest, adjustable rate
mortgage (ARM), interest-only, and others. We describe the pros
and cons of these loan types in Chapter 5. If you’re still unclear
about the benefits and drawbacks of a particular loan program, ask
the bank representative or your mortgage broker lots of questions.
Don’t get too caught up in the various loan types. For people buying
houses they plan to reside in for 30 years, loan type is a big factor.
For real estate investors, particularly those who plan to sell the
property or refinance the loan within a couple of years, the cost of
the loan over the life of the loan becomes more important. To com-
pare loans and find the best bargains, take the following steps:
1. Start with the amount the bank charges you upfront in
loan origination fees, points, and other fees.
When performing these calculations, include all points, but
realize that not all points are created equal. Lenders can
charge discount points, defined by some states as the legal
cost associated with reducing the interest rate for a bor-
rower. Lenders can also charge points as a fee (for exam-
ple, origination points) that don’t reduce the borrower’s
interest rate.
2. Multiply the monthly payment times the number of
months you plan to pay on the loan.
3. Add the two amounts to determine your total payment.
4. Total the amount of each payment that goes toward
paying the principal of the loan.
Your lender can tell you how much of each payment goes
toward principal.
5. Subtract the total you determined in Step 4 from the total
in Step 3.
The result is the total amount you can expect to pay for the
loan over the life of the loan.
To save yourself some time performing these calculations, check
out the mortgage payment calculator on our Mortgage Myths Web
site at (www.themortgagemyths.com).
Say that you’re considering two loans, each for $100,000. You plan
on using the loan to buy and renovate a home over two years and
Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 103

then sell it and pay off the remaining principal on the loan. You
have a choice between a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 6 percent
or a 30-year, interest-only loan at 5 percent. Look at the 6-percent,
fixed-rate mortgage first:
Loan origination fee and discount points:
$1,000.00
Monthly payment of $599.55 × 24 months:
$14,389.20
Total payments (fees plus monthly payments):
$15,389.20
Total paid toward principal:
$2,531.75
Total cost of loan (payments minus 
$12,857.45
principal paid):
Here are the numbers for the 30-year, interest-only loan at 5 percent:
Loan origination fee and discount points:
$1,000.00
Monthly payment of $416.67 × 24 months:
$10,000.08
Total payments:
$11,000.08
Total paid toward principal:
$0.00
Total cost of loan:
$11,000.08
As you can see, even though you’re not paying down the principal
on the interest-only loan, over the life of the loan, you pay about
$1,700 less. In addition, the interest-only loan has much lower
monthly payments, freeing up cash to use for renovations and
other investments.
As a general rule for quick flips (buying and selling a property in
less than a year’s time), opt for loans with low (or no) closing
costs, low (or no) discount points, and low interest rates. Avoid
any loans that have early-payment penalties.
Don’t forget to account for cash flow and tax benefits that may be
available. A lender may charge you $3,000 in points, but if you can
write off a portion of that mortgage interest on your taxes, it may
end up costing you less than $3,000. Also, always remember that
having access to financing is often more important than the cost of
that financing. Crunch the numbers to get the lowest-cost loan
available, but don’t beat yourself up if you have to pay more than
average — as long as you can walk away with a decent profit and a
positive cash flow.
One more, very important word of caution: Always factor in a
margin of error to account for the unexpected.

A
ssuming you own the home you live in, you’ve already filled
out at least one loan application and have been through one
closing. Whether you did everything correctly is another question,
but at least you have a general sense of how the process works.
As the buyer of a residential property and the borrower, you have
the most papers to sign — papers dealing not only with the prop-
erty you’re buying but also with the loan you’re taking out to
finance the purchase. Faced with mountains of documents to sign,
borrowers (even seasoned investors) often give the paperwork a
cursory check at most before signing on the dotted line. This care-
lessness can be a big mistake, however, leaving you open to sign-
ing up for something you never really agreed to.
In this chapter, we review the closing process in greater detail and
show you how to avoid many of the traps that ensnare even the
savviest real estate investors.
Completing Your Loan Application
Filling out a loan application isn’t exactly rocket science, but it
does call for some careful attention to detail. The application
requires specific and accurate financial details that enable your
loan originator (broker or loan officer) and your lender to properly
evaluate your current financial situation and your ability to make
payments and repay the loan. In addition, the lender provides you

with specific information, by way of lender disclosures, about the
loan program and its costs.
In the following sections, we show you how to complete the loan
application, review the various disclosures, supply the additional
documentation your lender needs to process your application, and
sign a release of information, so your lender can confirm the infor-
mation you supply.
Walking through the parts 
of the loan application
In order to be able to accurately complete the loan application,
you first need a good grasp on what the form comprises.
Everything in your loan application package revolves around the
Uniform Residential Loan Application — a five-page, fill-in-the-blank
form that requests all sorts of information about the property
you’re buying and your financial situation. Although your loan orig-
inator actually prepares the form for you, go through the process
yourself first so that you can gather the necessary information
ahead of time and see for yourself what the lender looks at to
determine whether you qualify for the loan.
The Uniform Residential Loan Application is commonly referred to
as the FNMA (Fannie Mae) 1003 application or simply the Ten-Oh-
Three. To download the form, visit www.efanniemae.com/sf/
formsdocs/forms/1003.jsp and click the link for the desired 
version — the blank form or an interactive version you can type
your own entries into.
The form consists of ten sections:
 I. Type of Mortgage and Terms of Loan: Basic information
about the loan, including the type (FHA, VA, Conventional,
Rural), total loan amount, interest rate, term (number of
months), and amortization type. Your loan originator can
supply this information. Refer to Chapter 6 for details about
amortization.
 II. Property Information and Purpose of Loan: Description of
the property (including its location) and how you plan to use
it: as a primary residence, secondary residence, or investment
property. This section also covers whether the loan is for new
construction or refinance, how the title will be held, and the
source of the down payment and any closing costs.
 III. Borrower Information: General information about you,
including your name, address, previous address, Social
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
106

Security Number, marital status, number of children (if any),
and so on.
 IV. Employment Information: Information about your and any
coborrower’s employment, including names and addresses of
the most recent three employers, dates of employment, and
monthly gross income. The lender wants to know the past two
to five years’ history.
 V. Monthly Income and Combined Housing Expense
Information: Information about monthly income including
base pay, bonuses, overtime, commissions, dividends and
interest, and rental income, along with housing expenses that
include any monthly rent, existing home loan payment (princi-
pal and interest), property taxes, mortgage insurance, home-
owners’ association fees, and so forth.
 VI. Assets and Liabilities: The value of what you own (assets)
and how much you owe (liabilities). Assets include balances
in checking and savings accounts, stocks and bonds, the cur-
rent cash value of any life insurance policies, vested interest
in retirement funds, the value of any real estate you own, and
so on. Liabilities include any current loans you have, credit
card debt, alimony or child support payments, and job-related
expenses (including child care).
 VII. Details of Transaction: Overview of the financial aspects
of this particular loan, itemizing the costs and sources of
financing. Costs include the purchase price, cost of alterations
and improvements, cost of land (if purchased separately), 
refinance costs (debts to be paid off through the refinance),
closing costs, cost of mortgage insurance, and so on. Sources
of financing include the loan itself, closing costs paid for by
the seller (if any), cash from the borrower, and other sources.
You may need to consult your loan officer and others involved
in the transaction to gather all the information you need.
 VIII. Declarations: Yes/no questions for you and your co-
borrower (if applicable) to determine whether past or present
situations may affect your ability to make payments and pay
the loan. Questions include whether you have any outstand-
ing judgments, whether you’ve declared bankruptcy or 
suffered foreclosure, whether you’re obligated to pay child
support or alimony, and so on.
 IX. Acknowledgement and Agreement: Here is where you
sign, acknowledging that the information in this loan applica-
tion is correct to the best of your knowledge and that you and
any coborrower are knowingly entering into this agreement
with the lender.
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 107

 X. Information for Government Monitoring Purposes:
Information that enables the government to track statistics on
mortgages and homeownership relating to race and ethnicity.
The information also enables the government to enforce any
antidiscrimination rules and regulations.
As an investor, you know that the more prepared you are, the more
quickly you get things done. The same is true with financing. By
having all the necessary information at your fingertips, you can
work with your lender (or loan officer) to complete your loan
application in a matter of minutes.
Although you may be tempted to fudge the facts on the Uniform
Residential Loan Application, don’t do it (or allow anyone else to
do it for you). Lying on a loan application is all too common, but
it’s also a felony. The rules are ultimately meant to protect you. If
your net assets are too small to qualify for the loan, for example,
then having your application rejected protects you from a poten-
tial financial nightmare. See lenders as your partners, not your ene-
mies. For more about dodging the real estate and mortgage fraud
bullet, turn to Chapter 2 for more info.
Reviewing the lender’s disclosures
In the Declarations section of the 1003 (see the previous section),
you and any coborrower must answer several disclosure questions
as a way of “coming clean” about your current financial situation.
Your lender also must commit to a certain level of transparency
regarding its practices and the loan you’re applying for. For example,
by law, a lender can’t play some cruel game of bait-and-switch on
you by dangling an attractive set of numbers during the application
process and then sticking you with a real stinker of a loan at closing.
Be sure to examine the lender’s disclosures carefully before signing
on the dotted line, as explained in the following sections. At the
closing, make sure the lender adheres to whatever those disclo-
sures stipulate. (For more about closing, skip ahead to the section
entitled “Navigating the Closing.”)
Program disclosures
Regardless of the loan program, be sure you fully understand the
program disclosures (the terms of the loan agreement) before you
sign anything. If you don’t understand how a particular type of
loan works, keep asking your mortgage expert questions until you
fully understand what you’re getting yourself into.
For example, some loan programs are straightforward. If you’re
taking out a 30-year mortgage at 7.5 percent interest, the lender
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
108

has very little to disclose about the program itself. On the other
hand, more-complicated loan programs may require that the
lender provide an additional disclosure. With adjustable rate mort-
gage (ARM) programs, for example, the lender must notify you of
the index it uses, the margin associated with the loan, and how and
when the lender calculates changes to your interest rate. For more
about ARMs, including the roles that the index and margin play,
check out Chapter 5.
The disclosure may also contain a hypothetical example showing a
brief history of changes and how your rate may have changed
under that program if you had a loan with those terms. (For more
about ARMs, including the roles that the index and margin play,
head to Chapter 5.)
Good Faith Estimate
For all loan types, your lender is required by law to provide you
with a ballpark figure of all the costs associated with this loan in
the form of a Good Faith Estimate (or GFE, in industry lingo). The
GFE provides a complete breakdown of all the costs associated
with the loan you’re applying for, including the loan origination fee,
appraisal fee, and underwriting fee. Only by comparing GFEs can
you get a good feel of what’s normal and what’s excessive in the
market. Although the lender must supply the GFE to you within
three days of receiving your application, most lenders offer the
GFE prior to the application.
Ask for the GFE in advance, so you don’t waste time applying for a
loan you have no intention of following through on. In fact, obtain a
GFE from at least three lenders so you can compare the programs
and their costs. Watch for junk fees (unfair charges), as discussed
in Chapter 6. If any of the costs on the GFE look out of the ordinary,
ask about it.
Truth In Lending statement
The Truth-In-Lending disclosure (TIL) gives you a reflection of the
true cost of the loan, including the interest rate and fees. In short,
the TIL makes it easier for you to comparison-shop for loans.
One of the key items on the TIL is the annual percentage rate
(APR), as discussed in Chapter 6. The APR shows you how much
interest you’re really paying on a loan if you include the upfront
costs in your calculations. For example, say you’re comparing the
following two loans:
 $100,000 30-year fixed rate loan at 7 percent interest with
finance costs of $5,000
 $100,000 30-year fixed rate loan at 8 percent interest with
finance costs of $4,000
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 109

With numbers like these tossed about, comparison-shopping
becomes almost impossible. At first glance, the second loan may
seem like the better deal, costing $1,000 less upfront, but if you
look at the APR, you get a different picture:
 The first loan has an APR of 7.52 percent and costs you
$251,485 over the life of the loan.
 The second loan has an APR of 8.44 percent and costs you
$274,723 over the life of the loan, or $23,238 more than loan one.
The TIL also discloses any late-payment fees associated with the
loan, whether the loan has any early-payment penalties, and the
proposed payment schedule. If the loan is an ARM loan, it may illus-
trate what will happen to the payments as the rate starts to change.
The TIL is a great tool for taking a quick look at which loan among
several is the best deal, but it doesn’t provide enough information
to evaluate specific costs associated with a particular loan. Use it
in tandem with the GFE. 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)
RESPA standardizes closings for residential real estate transactions
in order to clamp down on any funny business that may occur at
closing. According to the act, all closings must use a HUD-1 form to
disclose the costs of the loan and show where all the disbursed
funds are going.
Take a copy of your GFE to the closing to compare the fees dis-
closed on it with the fees actually being charged according to the
HUD-1. This practice is one of the best ways to catch any discrep-
ancies between what your loan originator told you and what it’s
actually charging you.
RESPA also controls certain actions of settlement providers such
as the closing agent, and service providers (including the title
insurance provider, credit company, and appraiser) to prevent
them from working together against the best interests of the con-
sumer (as in the case of price-gouging or kickbacks). Section 8 of
RESPA has two important components:
 The first part prevents a lender from overcharging for settle-
ment services and keeping the difference. For example, if the
appraisal costs $400, the lender can’t charge you $600 and
pocket the extra $200.
 The second part prevents lenders and service providers from
accepting or offering kickbacks for referral business — for
example, a lender can’t refer a specific appraiser and then
accept part of the appraiser’s fee as a reward.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
110

RESPA’s provisions cover all aspects of services, companies, and
individuals, including title companies, attorneys, and real estate
agents.
HOEPA — Section 32
The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) is an
amendment to the Truth In Lending Act (TILA) to protect homeown-
ers from paying excessive fees and interest. HOEPA is part of TILA
but stands alone in its application; Congress passed these two sep-
arate acts:
 TILA covers all residential loan transactions (one- to four-
family units), whether they’re owner-occupied or investment
properties. It doesn’t apply to commercial loan transactions.
 HOEPA, also referred to as “Section 32” or “high-rate, high-fee
loan disclosures,” applies to residential owner-occupied
dwellings for purchases and refinances. It includes one- to
four-family owner-occupied properties (which could be a
multiunit investment property in which one unit is occupied
by the investor). It also applies to anyone you sell the property
to. HOEPA doesn’t apply to pure investment properties or
commercial loan transactions, but you should always be aware
of it so you know what’s considered fair in terms of fees.
Under this regulation, lenders must warn borrowers if APRs exceed
10 percent of the comparable Treasury yield (which means
Treasury securities having a similar period of maturity, such as 30
years), or if the deal’s total points and fees exceed 8 percent of the
loan amount.
Most lenders don’t offer loans that fall under Section 32, including
to investors, so this regulation usually isn’t an issue. Just be aware
of these restrictions and limitations to make sure you’re working
with a lender who plays by the rules.
Supplying the requested 
documentation
In order to review your loan application, your lender needs some
supporting documentation that verifies the information you sup-
plied. Gather the following documents:
 Federal tax returns (with all attachments and schedules) for
the past two years
 W-2s from the past two years
 30-days’ worth of paycheck stubs
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 111

 List of real estate owned, complete with income and expenses
 Any and all supporting documentation for assets and liabili-
ties listed on the Uniform Residential Loan Application (bank
statements, credit card statements, divorce decree, retirement
earnings statements, and so on)
Make a copy of each document in the list and place them neatly in
a folder labeled with your name and contact information. You can
then hand the entire package (the copies, not the originals) over to
your loan originator at your next meeting.
Signing a release of information
Providing your loan originator with a loan application package is
like submitting a resume for a job — it paints a picture of you on
paper, but it may not be an accurate portrait. To make sure the
information is factual, your loan originator needs to verify it in the
real world, usually by checking independent sources such as
employers, banks, and even providers of government benefits.
Most lenders require that you sign a borrow authorization form,
which gives them permission to check your credit and independ-
ently verify any information you provide for this transaction.
Before you sign the release, read it carefully to make sure it covers
only this transaction. You don’t want to give anyone carte blanche
to poke around in your financial affairs whenever they want.
Additionally you may be asked to sign an IRS Form 4506 or 8821 for
verifying tax return information. These forms are standard, but make
sure you don’t sign blank ones — make the lender fill out the years
covered, or else it can go get your tax returns from six years ago.
Following the Loan 
Processing Trail
After you supply your prospective lender with a completed loan
application and supporting documentation, all you can really do is
wait. During this time, you may be wondering what the lender is
doing, whether you need to be doing something, and how this
whole loan application process is going to unfold.
To prevent anxiety from overtaking you, the following sections lead
you through the course of a processing and keep you posted on
the possible outcomes.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
112

Getting up to speed on 
the underwriting process
You may be under the illusion that right now an accountant is comb-
ing through your loan application and supporting documents for
proof that you’re worthy of a loan. The fact is that nowadays com-
puters actually do the initial screening. The information you provide
is entered into an automated underwriting (AU) system, which per-
forms a preliminary evaluation and spits out the conditions and doc-
umentation requirements of the loan.
The AU system can’t deny your loan application. It can only place
your application in one of the following three categories:
 Accept/Eligible: This category is the best; it means that
you’re approved for the loan, subject to certain conditions.
Those conditions show up on the findings report and must be
part of the file for final approval. The loan officer or processor
obtains the necessary documents as requested and then sub-
mits the complete file to the underwriter to review for accu-
racy. The file is already approved at this point, so they’re only
looking to make sure you’ve submitted and signed each of the
required supporting documents and disclosures.
 Accept/Ineligible: This category indicates that the loan is
approved but is ineligible for purchase in the conforming
market (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac). For example, it may be a
jumbo loan, where the loan amount is outside the upper limit
of what Fannie and Freddie can purchase. Many investors still
use AU systems and approve/buy these loans anyway.
 Refer: This category is also typically known as a dead deal. An
underwriter still has to review the file before it can be denied,
but loan files that fall in this category don’t come with the same
lender guarantees against loan losses, so the lender has no
incentive to take on the additional risk of approval. Unless the
loan can be repackaged and resubmitted to obtain a different
AU result, the deal is likely DOA.
Don’t let a dead deal get you down. Even if you can’t obtain a loan
from traditional sources, you can usually find other means of
financing your investments, as we explain in Part IV.
Obtaining an appraisal or AVM
One of the first things any lender wants to know is whether the
property you’re buying is worth the money you’re borrowing to
pay for it. Actually, it wants to make sure the property is worth
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 113

more than the money you’re borrowing so that if anything prevents
you from paying back the loan, the lender has something of suffi-
cient value to sell and recoup its investment.
To assess the value of a property, the lender orders an appraisal,
an Automated Valuation Model (AVM) report, or both and usually
charges you for it as a part of the cost of processing your loan.
This appraisal isn’t something you order — the lender wants to be
in charge of picking an objective appraiser.
Expect to pay the full price for an appraisal, even if the property
was recently appraised. Old appraisals can’t be recertified no
matter how recent they may be.
Appraisers generally take one of the following three approaches
when performing an appraisal:
 Sales comparison: This most-common form of appraisal for
residential properties compares the property to similar,
recently sold properties in the same vicinity. The appraiser
can then adjust her estimate by accounting for differences
between the comparable homes and depreciation.
 Income approach: This method is used for income-producing
properties, such as rental units. The appraiser compares simi-
lar properties in the same market to determine how much
income the appraised property is likely to generate.
 Cost approach: This method is commonly used to establish
the value of a unique property or properties in areas where
few comparisons are available. The appraiser determines the
value of the land and improvements (the building on the land)
and then subtracts for depreciation.
An appraisal that uses the income approach is likely to cost a little
more than a market-comparison appraisal, but not a whole lot
more. If the lender tries to charge you hundreds of dollars more
than you’d be paying for a standard appraisal (for a typical owner-
occupied residential dwelling), find out why.
Having the property inspected
Whenever you make an offer on a property, make the offer contin-
gent upon the property passing inspection, and then have the
home professionally inspected. (This action is more for your pro-
tection than the lender’s. Lenders usually don’t require an inspec-
tion, even on government-secured loans.) This contingency
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
114

ensures that you don’t get stuck holding the bag on any of the 
following big-ticket items:
 Damaged foundation or other structural anomalies
 Electrical wiring problems
 Broken sewer lines, poor plumbing, or aging septic systems,
especially if the house has been vacant for some time
 Leaking, nonfunctioning, or nonexistent gas lines
 Poorly functioning furnace or central air conditioning units
 Leaking or ramshackle roof
 Termite damage
 Health hazards such as lead-based paint, toxic mold, radon
gas, asbestos, and hazardous insulation
In the following sections, we show you how to track down a profes-
sional home inspector and ensure that you obtain a thorough
inspection.
Hiring a qualified home inspector
If you decide to hire an inspector, you can crack open the phone
book and find listings for dozens of home inspectors in just about
any area of the country. Finding a qualified home inspector, how-
ever, is a challenge. So where do you start? Ask the following indi-
viduals for referrals:
 Your real estate agent or other real estate professionals you
know: By networking with homeowners, investors, and col-
leagues, real estate professionals know the best service
providers in the area. Ask them for references to the best
inspectors. If one inspector’s name pops up on several lists,
you’ve probably found a winner.
 The National Association of Certified Home Inspectors
(NACHI) Web site: NACHI is a nonprofit agency that works
toward educating and ensuring the quality of home inspec-
tors. Its Web site at www.nachi.org features an online referral
service that you can search to find certified home inspectors
in your area. Make sure the inspector you hire is NACHI-
certified — meaning the member has performed at least 250
inspections and passed two written proficiency exams.
 Friends, family members, and colleagues: Gather referrals
from people you know and trust. Using an inspector who’s done
a satisfactory job for someone you know usually delivers better
results than choosing someone blindly.
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 115

 Your town’s building inspection department: Most towns have
building inspectors who examine buildings as they’re being
constructed or renovated to ensure that they adhere to the
local building codes. In some cases, you can hire the town’s
building inspectors to perform your inspection for you. They
tend to be more thorough, and they’re well versed on local
building codes. The inspectors often show up as a team that
typically includes a plumber, an electrician, a heating and air
conditioning specialist, a builder, and someone who specializes
in zoning. You get a thorough inspection and a complete write-
up for about the same price as you’d pay a private inspector.
 Better Business Bureau (BBB): Although the BBB has a policy
of not recommending certain businesses, it does offer a tool
that enables you to search for BBB-certified businesses in
your area. Start your search at welcome.bbb.org, where you
can enter your ZIP code to skip to the Web site for the nearest
BBB. You can then click the Find an Accredited BBB Business
to start your search.
When you have a few leads, contact your candidates and ask them
the following questions:
 Are you certified, licensed, and insured? Certification and
licensing ensure that the inspector has the basic qualifica-
tions for the job. Insurance covers any serious defects he may
overlook.
 How long have you been a home inspector? Length of serv-
ice is often, but not always, a good indication of experience
and expertise. Someone who’s been in the business for 10
years probably has more experience than a person who’s just
getting started.
 How many homes have you inspected? “One or two” isn’t the
answer you’re looking for. A busy home inspector is usually
busy because she’s good.
 What did you do before becoming a home inspector?
Someone who’s a retired carpenter or home builder is proba-
bly a better candidate than, say, a burned-out English teacher.
 Do you have references I can call? If the inspector has a
good track record, people don’t hesitate to provide positive
references.
 Do you recommend remedies or simply identify problems?
Look for an inspector who’s had experience in construction.
Someone who not only points out problems but also recom-
mends repairs and renovations is a good choice.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
116

 How much do you charge? Most inspectors charge a flat fee
of a few hundred bucks — more or less depending on the size
of the home and the complexity of the inspection. As you
interview candidates, you can get a pretty good idea of the
going rate for a typical home inspection in your area.
After you gather answers and information from all your candidates,
make a decision. Sit down with your list and identify the inspector
who has the best experience and credentials of the bunch but
doesn’t charge an exorbitant fee.
Attending the inspection
Although attendance isn’t mandatory, you should show up for the
inspection prepared to take notes. Your notes should include the
following:
 Possible structural defects: The inspector will point out
cracked foundation walls, weak roof trusses, or shifting foot-
ings or joists. These problems can be extremely costly and
can kill a deal quickly.
 List of functional defects: Examples include a furnace that no
longer functions or is leaking carbon monoxide, or a toilet that
doesn’t flush. These are critical repairs that have the most
impact on your ability to resell the property or lease it out.
 List of potential environmental problems: An example
includes insulation that contains asbestos or ground on the
lot that’s been contaminated by a local industrial plant. These
can be costly to fix.
 List of cosmetic defects: These include divots or dents in the
walls, peeling paint, and other defects that just look bad.
They’re less-serious stuff.
 Anything else the inspector points out: These may range
from minor issues, such as a leaky faucet, to more major
issues, such as a stained ceiling that may be a sign of some-
thing more serious, but the inspector can’t gain access to the
area above the ceiling to check it out. 
If you’re note-taking challenged, consider carrying a digital recorder
with you during the inspection. Just don’t forget to turn it on.
Requesting repairs
With your list of property defects in hand, highlight the ones you
expect the seller to repair and then have your agent present the
list to the seller or seller’s agent. The seller agrees to make all
repairs, refuses to make all repairs, or agrees to make only some of
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 117

the repairs. It’s up to you to decide whether you want to move for-
ward with the deal.
For any repairs you’re willing to take on and other renovations to
improve the property, obtain estimates from independent contrac-
tors to determine approximate costs. Get three bids from licensed
professionals, including the time estimated to complete the work,
as well as the lead time needed to schedule the work.
Don’t get your inspector involved in providing estimates or doing
any repairs or renovations to a property. This creates a conflict of
interest, which is prohibited on government-insured loans.
For additional details on how to determine whether a property is
likely to be a profitable investment, check out Ralph and Joe’s
Flipping Houses For Dummies (Wiley) and Real Estate Investing For
Dummies, 2nd edition, by Eric Tyson and Robert S. Griswold (Wiley).
When you’re estimating the costs of repairs and renovations, keep
in mind that as soon as you take possession of the property (at
closing), you’re responsible for the holding costs on the property
when repairs are being done. (Holding costs are the expenses you
incur when the property is just sitting there — they include the
monthly mortgage payments, insurance, property taxes, and utili-
ties.) By planning your repairs and renovations prior to closing
and lining up contractors to begin work as soon as possible after
closing, you can slash your holding costs.
Testing the water
You may not need to test the water as a condition for obtaining
loan approval, but if the system is served by a well, get the water
tested for your own protection. Your county health department or
an independent lab can perform the required tests, but you need
to collect the water:
1. Get a clean bottle from the lab or your county health
department.
2. Go to the water faucet farthest from the well source.
3. Let the water run for at least five minutes.
4. Fill the bottle and label it as instructed.
5. Have the sample tested right away.
The lab usually returns the results within a couple of days and
lets you know the chemical makeup, including minerals 
and any detectable E. coli in the water.
If the property is serviced by a community well, request 
maintenance records.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
118

I, Chip, usually steer clear of properties serviced by community
wells. I also avoid properties on which the well is located in a
crawl space or basement. These pose financing risks, and any
eventual buyer will be limited in financing options.
Having the septic system inspected
If the property relies on a septic system, have a qualified septic
contractor inspect the field, saturation levels, and estimated
remaining life of the system. These systems can be very costly to
replace.
Also, research the pumping records with the owner and the county
(usually the county health department), and check with the county
on the age of the system and its maintenance history. The county
should have records of when the system was installed and a pump
card that shows when it was last pumped out.
If the system is more than 10 years old, we highly recommend that
you have a qualified professional perform a perk test. This test
makes sure the septic field is draining properly and isn’t saturated
(a situation that indicates a short remaining life).
Obtaining a survey
Your lender will request a survey on the property, regardless of the
size of the parcel, even if it’s a platted lot (a lot with boundaries
shown on a map). To insure the transaction, the title company
requires a survey or certification of an existing survey. Surveys
come in two types:
 Boundary survey: This type illustrates where the property
lines are and is usually sufficient for a platted lot, because the
parcel’s boundaries have already been recorded.
 Stake survey: With this type the surveyor actually goes out
and places or finds metal boundary stakes to certify the
actual boundary lines of the parcel. The stake survey is
slightly more expensive, but it’s the better choice for water-
front property, irregular parcels, and properties with a metes-
and-bounds description (commonly found in a deed).
Walk the property with the owner to be sure you know where the
boundary lines are, and ask questions about any easements or
encroachments that may exist. If the owner/seller has a copy of the
previous survey, obtain a copy so the surveyor can recertify it
instead of performing a new survey — you may save a few bucks.
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 119

Navigating the Closing
Although the closing (or settlement) is the final step in the real
estate transaction, it can feel a little anticlimactic. You and the
other participants in the transaction have completed your work.
Now you’re simply meeting to sign off on the deal you’ve all agreed
to and shuffle the money around to the appropriate recipients.
Even though the process may seem like an afterthought on a long
journey, you really need to stay on your toes to avoid any last-
minute mishaps. In the following sections, we show you how to
ensure that the closing proceeds smoothly without any glitches
that can negatively affect your bottom line.
Keeping your attorney in the loop
A good real estate attorney can keep you from spending thousands
of dollars later to clean up a mess that you can easily avoid now.
Get your attorney involved sooner rather than later in the 
following ways:
 Make sure your attorney reviews the purchase agreement
before you make an offer. Consider working with your attor-
ney to develop a boilerplate purchase agreement you can use
for all of your transactions, so your attorney doesn’t have to
review it every time.
 Have your attorney present during any sensitive or unusual
negotiations. If you’re not completely comfortable with some-
thing the seller or seller’s representative is saying, consult
your attorney before giving a final response. Backing away
from something you agreed to, even verbally, can make your
attorney’s job more difficult later.
 Ask your attorney to review the closing papers prior to the
closing date. Have the company handling the closing supply
you with copies at least three days in advance.
Get your attorney involved early. She probably won’t be able to
help you after the closing; even if she can, it’ll cost you a whole lot
more than if you had corrected the errors before you signed the
papers.
Dealing with the preliminaries
Closings usually proceed smoothly as long as you have all the
parts in place prior to closing. In the following sections, we show
you how to prepare for your next closing.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
120

Hiring a title company
Closing is pretty easy, at least from your perspective. In most
cases, your agent or the seller’s agent selects a title company, and
the title company does the rest — gathering all the essential paper-
work, making sure everyone shows up to the closing on time, and
then routing the closing documents around the table to make sure
everything gets signed.
The title company also provides title insurance — your only pro-
tection from future claims against the property, including old co-
owners, lien holders (other parties that claim rights to the
property), backside deals (private negotiated or unrecorded agree-
ments) with neighbors, and a whole host of other potential prob-
lems. Approximately a month after closing, the title company
sends you a complete policy. Store it in a safe place — in addition
to providing you with a record that you have title insurance, the
policy can earn you credit toward the next policy when you sell or
refinance the property.
Never ever purchase a property without title insurance. Without
title insurance, you can lose your entire investment overnight. One
way this can and has happened is when a scam artist sells a prop-
erty he doesn’t own. The con artist waits until the owners are on
an extended vacation and uses a phony deed to transfer the prop-
erty into his own name. He then lists and sells the property and
takes off with the cash. If you happen to have bought the place,
and you don’t have title insurance, when the rightful owners return
from vacation, you lose the property, but you still owe on that loan
you took out to buy it.
Under RESPA (Section 9), you as purchaser have the exclusive
right to select the title insurance provider. We encourage you to go
with one of the national agencies or one of their agents — someone
with a solid reputation in the marketplace. In addition, larger com-
panies have several offices, making dealings more convenient
when closing time arrives.
Request an insured closing letter, indicating that the title company
is insured for handling the transaction. This document provides
you with the assurance that if the closing company mishandles
anything, you don’t get stuck with a bill for its mistake.
The title company disburses funds on investment properties imme-
diately upon the close of the transaction. Request a copy of each
disbursement check for your records.
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 121

Reviewing the documents in advance
You have the right to review any closing documents at least 24
hours prior to closing (preferably three days before closing, so
your attorney has time to review them, too). As soon as you’ve
chosen a title company, contact the company and let your repre-
sentative know that you want a copy of the closing packet as soon
as possible so you have time to review the paperwork.
Check the mortgage, deed, note, HUD-1 closing statement, and all
other documents for spelling or calculation errors, and make sure
the figures on the HUD-1 match up with those on the Good Faith
Estimate. If anything looks odd, call the title company and have
your issues addressed before closing. 
Insuring the property
Several days prior to closing, meet with your insurance provider
and review coverage options for the property you’re about to pur-
chase. Let your agent know the closing date so he can prepare a
policy for you in advance of the closing.
Make sure you obtain a policy and not just an insurance binder (a
promise to insure) — some lenders don’t accept binders.
Signing the documents
Be prepared to sign a lot of documents during closing (and no, you
can’t use a rubber stamp!) You have to provide a picture ID (such
as a driver’s license). The closing agent witnesses and notarizes
your signature many times during the closing.
Request a complete copy set of all signed documents (not just
blank ones) and keep them in a safe place just in case you need
them in the future. In the court of real estate law, only signed docu-
ments count, so be sure you get a copy of the signed documents
showing what you and the seller agreed to.
Knowing your right of rescission . . .
or lack thereof
The right of rescission is a federal law that gives you three days to
change your mind on financial deals. It protects consumers from
high-pressure sales tactics. Commonly called the “cooling-off law,”
it also allows you to back out of refinance deals on owner-occupied
residences.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
122

As an investor, don’t count on the right of rescission to protect
you. It doesn’t apply to the purchase agreement — after you sign
the agreement, your offer is binding. In addition, the right applies
only to owner-occupied residences, not investment properties.
Dealing with surprises
The key to dealing effectively with surprises at closing is to not
have any surprises. In the following sections, you discover some
prevention maneuvers that ensure a smooth closing.
Rate changes
Your interest-rate lock agreement is only as good as the loan offi-
cer who gave it to you. You have nothing in writing to say that the
person actually locked in the rate with an investor or that the
terms of your application didn’t change just enough to allow (or
require) the loan officer to place it with a different lender-investor
or a completely different loan program.
At least two days prior to closing, confirm your interest rate and
program with the loan officer. If you had been floating the interest
rate, he will require you to lock it in at least three days prior to
close so that he can prepare the documents. If it’s not what you
agreed upon, hold out until you’re satisfied with the rate and
terms. You won’t be able to change them after the closing.
Term changes
Confirm the terms of your loan (including index, margin, and start
rate for an ARM loan) prior to the closing. Your loan terms should
remain fixed unless something major occurred between the time of
your application and the closing, but ask anyway. You don’t want
any surprises.
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 123
Dodging disaster
How would you like to purchase a property and have it burn down the next day with-
out having insurance to cover it? I, Chip, almost had that happen to me. However,
the property actually burned down a day before closing. Fortunately, the previous
owners hadn’t cancelled their policy prior to close, or it would have been a real
mess. We had to wait for the property to be rebuilt before we could close on the
transaction — a delay of five months!
The moral of this story: Obtain an insurance policy before closing. Don’t leave the
property uninsured for even one minute — too many things can happen.

If rates improved since you obtained loan approval, or the prop-
erty numbers no longer meet your expectations, you may consider
changing loan programs in order to maximize your cash flow. Just
remember that any changes you make now cancel out the rate and
terms you locked in. Even a slight change can jeopardize your lock,
giving the lender an opportunity to charge extra fees and interest,
so be careful.
Other unexpected events
Once in awhile, other events throw a wrench into the proceedings —
and they’re completely beyond your control. The seller may have a
change of heart, the title company may require additional docu-
mentation to insure the title transfer, you may have to get lien
waivers, and so on. Take it all in stride — and prepare for a delay.
We’ve had lots of closings slightly postponed while someone fixed
a glitch, so keep your schedule (and that of your contractors) a
little loose.
You’re dealing with professionals, and they’re programmed to get
any problems resolved as quickly as possible. If anything sounds
too strange or flat-out made up, simply ask your attorney to call
the title company or closing agent. That usually gets the process
back on track pretty quickly!
Financing Other Types of
Residential Properties
Most of the information in this chapter relates to financing the pur-
chase of primary residences. Variations arise, however, when
you’re financing the purchase of other types of properties, includ-
ing vacation and investment properties and vacant land. The fol-
lowing sections introduce the variables you can expect and show
you how to deal with them.
Digging up money for 
vacation properties
If you’re in the market for a vacation property or second home,
expect the financing requirements to be a lot tighter, the interest rate
and costs to be higher, and the down-payment requirements to be
greater, with many lenders requiring at least 20 to 25 percent down.
Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 
124

Due to the higher costs, you may want to consider purchasing a
fractional ownership, in which you share the property with several
parties. This can be a great way to invest in higher-end properties
located in expensive markets. You can usually find a loan officer
who specializes in these types of loans.
Banks and other more traditional lenders rarely handle loans for
fractional ownerships, so you have to go through a specialized
group of finance companies. Shop around carefully for one that
specializes in this type of financing, and make sure that you have a
solid agreement with the other parties involved. Make absolutely
sure that your real estate attorney reviews all the paperwork and
that you fully understand what you’re getting yourself into.
A management company often makes all the arrangements, but
make sure you understand your obligations as an owner and how
the parties plan to share the income and expenses of the rentals or
the burden of expenses when the rentals are vacant? For more
information, check out Second Homes For Dummies by Bridget
McCrea and Stephen Spignesi (Wiley).
Financing investment properties
Lenders approach the financing of residential investment properties
(dwellings you rent out) more carefully than they do financing the
purchase of primary residences. As a result, you need to adjust
your expectations and approach to financing these properties in a
different way as well. We cover the main differences that come
with these properties in the following sections.
Options for financing residential investment properties are some-
what limited. Expect interest rates, costs, and the down-payment
requirements to all be higher. Often, lenders require a minimum of
25 percent down.
Shop around for a lender that offers several options for investment
properties, and be careful of extra fees. You should have to pay
only an additional 1.5 to 2 points above a normal owner-occupied
transaction. Check out Chapter 4 to find out how to shop around
for lenders.
Before approving a loan for any income-producing property, your
lender wants to know whether it promises a positive cash flow. Of
course, you want to know this, too, so before you even submit an
offer, perform a complete cash flow analysis of the property, as
explained in Chapter 3. Do the math before you do the deal, and if
the return on your investment is less than you’d earn by investing
Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 125

the money in a CD, we recommend sticking your money in a CD
instead.
Purchasing vacant land
You may be considering buying some vacant land, but before you
purchase any land, remember this point: Only purchase land if you
intend to use it for a specific purpose — not as strictly an invest-
ment in and of itself.
The saying goes that land is such a great investment because
“they’re not making any more of it.” Truth be told, land is rarely
such a grand investment for two good reasons:
 It’s tough to finance. Even if you find a lender willing to
finance the purchase, they usually require a high loan-to-
value, (LTV, as discussed in Chapter 3), which means you’re
locking up a lot of your investment capital in a down payment.
(Most land sales involve owner financing over a period of
time, with flexible terms and conditions.)
 It has a long holding period. Land isn’t a liquid asset. You
usually have to hold onto it for quite a long time before you
realize your gains. Again, your investment capital is locked up
in something that’s not producing any cash flow.
Two exceptions do exist to our recommendation: Land is a good
investment when
 You know that the land is very likely to be rezoned, causing its
value to increase significantly
 You intend to put it to personal use in construction, parking,
lease, and so on.

Financing the Purchase
of Commercial
Properties

In this part . . .
W
hen you’re in the market for commercial real estate
investment properties, your search for ﬁnancing is
likely to take some unexpected turns. From the very begin-
ning, you need to ﬁgure out the type of property you’re
interested in, because your choice ultimately inﬂuences
the types of ﬁnancing available.
This part gives you a clearer idea of not only the ﬁnancing
you need but also the types of commercial properties
you’re interested in. In this part, we introduce you to the
most common commercial property types so you can
choose the type best suited to your investment goals. We
take you on a tour of some of the unique sources of ﬁnanc-
ing available for commercial ventures. Finally, we step you
through the process of applying for commercial real estate
loans from application to closing.

O
ne of the easiest ways for a novice to get started in real estate
investing is through the process of flipping a single-family
dwelling. You buy a home below market value, fix it up to market stan-
dards, and sell it at or near its true market value. (Flipping Houses For
Dummies shows you how.) You already own a house (or you should
before you start buying and selling investment properties), and you
may have already sold one or two, so flipping allows you to use the
knowledge you’ve already gained to develop new skills.
Investing in single-family dwellings, however, is only one option.
Other options include multifamily dwellings, office space, strip
malls, hotels, motels, gas stations, and a host of other properties
that your average buy-and-sell house flipper never considers.
These commercial properties are more conducive to a buy-and-
hold strategy, because they offer the potential for generating a
steady stream of income.
In this chapter, we address important calculations you need to
make when considering investing in any commercial property,
reveal the various types of commercial properties you may want to
invest in, and provide you with the guidance you need to choose
opportunities that are most suitable for your investment goals.

Estimating the Income Potential 
of a Commercial Property
Evaluating the income potential of prospective commercial proper-
ties isn’t rocket science, but it does require that you perform some
basic arithmetic — subtracting expenses from income to deter-
mine cash flow. By performing these calculations, you can come up
with your own ballpark estimates of how potentially profitable any
commercial property will be.
In the following sections, we itemize the income and expense cate-
gories so you can begin collecting the numbers you need and
doing the math. (These calculations work for every type of com-
mercial property we cover in this chapter, although the specific
income and expense categories may vary.)
Calculating effective gross income
(EGI)
Whatever scenario you use for your commercial rentals and what-
ever your sources of revenue, the formulas follow the same pat-
tern. First, calculate your effective gross income (EGI) — all the
revenue you can reasonably expect the property to pull in. With an
estimated EGI in hand, you can then move on to other calculations
that reveal the property’s profit potential. To calculate the EGI, you
need the following numbers:
 Annual rental income: Multiply the net rentable square feet
by the annual lease income per square foot; for example, 3,000
net rentable square feet × $17 per square foot = $51,000 per year.
Don’t confuse gross square footage with net square footage —
you can’t charge anyone for space in a telephone room.
 Vacancy: Most lenders use a vacancy factor (to allow for the
amount of time the property sits vacant) in the 5 to 7 percent
range for retail properties. If you expect a higher vacancy rate
for this property, use that number (but don’t go lower than 
5 percent).
 Triple Net (or NNN): Income collected from tenants to pay for
taxes, insurance, and maintenance, including common area
maintenance (CAM) charges for shared-use spaces, such as
walkways and public restrooms. Although this is an expense
to you, you also treat it as income because your tenants reim-
burse you. Say the tenant occupies 7 percent of the building
and total expenses are $55,000. To calculate the tenant’s share
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
130

on a monthly basis, multiply the NNN by .07 and divide by 12
months. That would come to about $321 per month.
 Other income: This amount includes money you collect from
tenants for shared secretarial services, storage facilities, ship-
ping or loading dock usage, high-speed Internet or satellite
services, conference room rental, building signage rights, and
so on.
When you have these numbers, you’re ready to do the math to cal-
culate your EGI:
Annual Rental Income + NNN + Other Income = Total Income
Total Income – (Total Income × Vacancy Factor) = Effective
Gross Income
For example, say you have a small office complex that’s pulling in
$50,000 in rental income per year. It has a cellphone tower that
pulls in another $10,000 per year and a storage facility that
accounts for about $5,000 in income. Plus, the tenants collectively
chip in $15,000 to cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Rarely,
if ever, is one of the offices vacant, so you estimate the vacancy
factor at a low 5 percent. The calculation goes like this:
$50,000 + $10,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 = $80,000
$80,000 – ($80,000 × .05) = $76,000
Thus, your EGI for this property is $76,000.
Calculating Net Operating Income
(NOI)
After you calculate your estimated EGI, you can use that number to
calculate your Net Operating Income (NOI) — your annual income
from the property prior to considering the debt service (the princi-
pal and interest costs on the proposed loan). Before you can pro-
ceed, you need the following numbers:
 Operating expenses (OE): Operating expenses include taxes,
insurance, trash removal, maintenance, payroll, and so on.
 Management expenses (ME): Management expenses include
whatever you pay yourself or others to manage the property.
Remember, even if you manage the property, your time is
worth money.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commercial Property Type for You 131

 Tenant improvements (TI): Calculated on a per-square-foot
basis, these are costs to help renovate the space for the
tenant’s desired use. If the space was previously used by a
dentist, for example, and now you need to convert it into a
bookstore, you have some work to do. TI covers new carpet-
ing, the relocation of walls, the proper replacement of electri-
cal outlets and lights, and so on.
 Leasing concessions (LC): Leasing concessions (such as offer-
ing one month’s free rent) are sometimes necessary to attract
quality long-term tenants. You may also make concessions for
less-desirable situations like construction periods (of common
areas) and location differentials (the tenant at the end of the
hallway doesn’t get as good exposure as the guy in the middle
of the action).
 Credit losses (CL): Unfortunately, not everyone pays their
rent like they’re supposed to. To account for uncollectible
lease payments, budget for credit losses on a yearly basis.
When you have the required numbers, plug them into the following
equation to calculate your NOI:
EGI – OE – ME – TI – LC – CL = NOI
For example, suppose a property has an EGI of $76,000, as calculated
in the example in the previous section. Operating expenses come to
about $20,000. You pay yourself $4,000 per year to manage the prop-
erty and pay an assistant $1,500 to keep the records (for a total of
$5,500 in management expenses). You’re going to have to spend
$7,000 in tenant improvements to transform a corner office into a
small coffee shop for a vendor who’s moving in. To encourage some-
one to move into the less-glamorous office space, you offer a lease
concession of $2,500. And you estimate from the previous owner’s
records that your tenants are going to stiff you about 5 percent on
the rent that’s due. Here’s how the calculation would unfold:
$76,000 – $20,000 – $5,500 – $7,000 – $2,500 – 
($76,000 × .05) = $37,200
Your NOI on this property comes out to $37,200.
Estimating the property’s true value
If you’re wondering whether a particular retail space is worth the
asking price, you can calculate that for yourself by using the NOI
and local cap rate (market return based on risk). Cap rate is short
for capitalization rate, which is a reflection of the rate of return
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
132

that’s considered reasonable for a certain type of commercial
property in a given area based upon its risk.
You can get the local cap rate from a commercial appraiser. Divide
the NOI by the cap rate to estimate the value of the retail center:
NOI ÷ Cap Rate = Estimated Value
If the NOI is $213,000, for example, and the local cap rate is 7 per-
cent, your estimated value is about $3,042,900 ($213,000 ÷ .07)!
The NOI and estimated value of the property are the only two num-
bers that matter to the lender — and the only two numbers that
should matter to you, as well.
Projecting future profits 
with a pro forma
Whenever you meet with prospective lenders to discuss financing
for a commercial venture, the lenders often want you to fire up
your crystal ball and reveal the future possibilities — especially
when you have solid plans in place to build a rosy future. You can
present your vision for the property’s future through a pro forma —
a document that projects the future earnings of a property after
you’re able to implement your plans for it. The pro forma assures
the lender that you’ve analyzed the numbers and have realistic
expectations for the property’s performance.
When you first purchase a property, complete a construction project,
or finish a major rehabilitation, that property may not immediately
generate enough income to make it profitable. A new office building,
for example, doesn’t have 100-percent occupancy in the first six
months! Over the course of a year or two, however, that same prop-
erty may become very profitable. A pro forma shows just how prof-
itable the property is likely to be.
To create a pro forma, start with the current numbers you calcu-
lated in the previous sections and then project the income/
expenses based upon your reasonable assumptions (which you
must substantiate).
For example, if you show the building with pre-leases of 50 percent
initial occupancy and a projected growth of 20 percent per year,
your pro forma looks like the one shown in Table 8-1.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 133

Although this example is very simplified, it shows the lender what
your projected growth rate of the property is and how it will affect
the loan performance. Be prepared to break out all expenses and
supply real market data (including competing properties in the
area) to back up your assumptions.
Most pro forma projections should extend out two to three years —
five years for major new construction projects. Anything longer than
that, though, is pure speculation.
Don’t place blind trust in pro formas that other people present to you.
Sometimes, a seller may present you with a pro forma, for example, to
sell you on the potential of a property. Disreputable mortgage brokers
may also exaggerate the numbers in a pro forma to convince you to
move forward on a deal. Do your own projections.
Dwelling On the Thought 
of Multifamily Homes
People always need a place to live and don’t always have the
resources or desire to buy their own single-family home. As a
result, multifamily property investments have always been and will
always be a good long-term investment — assuming, of course, you
pick winners and structure the deals to work well for you.
Before seizing these potentially lucrative opportunities, however,
develop an understanding of what comprises a multifamily
dwelling. Technically speaking, a multifamily dwelling is any piece
of real estate that can legally house two or more families. But in
financial circles, these properties fall into two categories:
 Residential: Two- to four-family units classify as residential
properties, which qualifies them for residential financing. If
you plan on living in one of the units, you can usually qualify
for even more attractive loans available for owner-occupied
properties.
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
134

 Commercial: The rules of the game change with any multifam-
ily home over four units — you enter the world of commercial
finance, where the lenders, terms, loan programs, qualifica-
tions, and documentation requirements are all different.
(Properties with between 5 and about 20 units are considered
garden apartments. More than 20 units constitute large multi-
family units.)
The financing differences between these two categories are monu-
mental, as we explain in the following sections.
Two- to four-family homes
Two- to four-family homes — called duplexes, triplexes, or quads —
are by far the best investment opportunities in the marketplace for
beginning investors. Nowadays, you can find plenty of these prop-
erties on the market due to the foreclosure crisis — just make sure
to analyze the numbers carefully to account for all expenses and
maintenance. (See “Crunching the numbers” later in this chapter.)
These properties are also relatively easy to finance — especially if
they’re owner-occupied investment properties. (If you live in one
of the units, it’s considered owner-occupied.)
To qualify for a loan to finance the purchase of a multifamily prop-
erty, owner-occupied or not, you need strong credit and several
months of reserves to cover expenses in the event that you’re
unable to rent out one or more units.
Securing financing for owner-occupied properties
As discussed in Chapter 4, owner-occupied properties more easily
qualify for government financing, as long as you meet the following
conditions:
 Use at least one of the units as your primary residence for the
next 12 months.
 Make as little as a 3.5 percent down payment (FHA).
 Ensure that the property is self-sufficient; that is, the rental
income must cover the monthly payments and other costs,
including insurance, property taxes, landlord-paid utilities,
and maintenance.
 Present documentation that shows you have at least three
months of payment reserves.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 135

For multifamily properties, qualifying for the loan depends much
more on the revenue-generating potential of the property than
your job-related income to ensure that you can afford the payments.
Even with government-secured financing, you can expect to pay
more in costs and interest. The appraisal, for example, is likely to
cost about twice as much — to cover the time and effort to com-
plete an income-approach analysis on the property.
Securing financing for non-owner-occupied properties
The main difference between financing the purchase of an owner-
occupied property and one that’s non-owner-occupied (a property
you don’t plan to live in for at least 12 months) is the down pay-
ment. You can expect lenders to require a down payment of a
whopping 25 percent, and you still need to prove that you have
three months’ worth of reserves to cover expenses.
The good news is that you can own the property solely as a 
landlord — you don’t have to live in it.
Garden apartments
Properties that contain between 5 and about 20 individual units
typically fall into the category of garden apartments — an in-
between range that lenders love to finance (and in which the num-
bers often work very well for investors).
The only drawback here is that with garden apartments, you begin
to get into the category of commercial properties, where you no
longer qualify for the most attractive government-secured loans.
You don’t get any special breaks if you live in one of the units,
either, except for the fact that you don’t have to charge yourself
rent. Fortunately, more lenders are willing to finance these types of
properties than are willing to finance large multifamily properties.
Large multifamily properties
Large multifamily properties are, well, large. They’re complicated
undertakings. They can also be quite challenging and fun as long
as you’ve mastered the art of small- and mid-sized multifamily
properties first.
In terms of financing these behemoths of residential real estate,
you’re working smack dab in the middle of the commercial arena
where everything becomes a numbers game. Plus, fewer lenders
are available, and professional on-site management becomes a
must. Track down a mortgage broker who specializes in financing
commercial properties.
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
136

Lenders don’t want to deal with inexperienced landlords, so wade
in slowly. Start with two- to four-family units and work your way up
to a garden apartment complex before you attempt a large multi-
family property. Otherwise, you’re just wasting everyone’s time.
After you’ve gained some experience, you’re ready to move up and
gain some additional leverage.
When you’re evaluating the profit potential of large multifamily
properties, the main difference is that you have more expenses to
account for, such as payroll for maintenance or office personnel,
snowplowing trucks, parking lot striping, pool maintenance, and
other items.
Property management is one expense that’s a sure thing. Figure
this expense at 5 to 7 percent of the property’s gross potential
income. You’re better off overestimating than underestimating.
Of course, you may also have new sources of income. Coin-operated
laundry, clubhouse rental, carports, and storage fees may add up to
some serious cash. (Check out Property Management For Dummies,
2nd Edition, by Robert Griswold [Wiley] for more info about increas-
ing your income sources.)
Lenders want to see a complete breakdown of all the sources of
income and each line item expense. Work closely with a good,
experienced commercial loan broker. You can expect your broker
to work hard to put together a comprehensive loan package and
submit it to the proper lenders who specialize in this type of
financing. We guarantee it won’t be your local bank.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 137
If I were young again . . .
Many of my (Chip’s) first starter properties were duplexes, which provide a nice way
to cover the mortgage payment and live rent free! One of my first properties was a
two-family unit near the University of Michigan football stadium. We were even able
to earn extra income by charging for parking on Saturdays! One game could pay
for an entire month’s mortgage — plus pizza and beer!
If I were to start all over again, at the age of 18, I would buy a four-family property
and finance it with an FHA loan. Multifamily units are great opportunities for enter-
ing into the world of investment real estate without exposing yourself to a great deal
of risk. You can get into the property for as little as a 3.5 percent down payment, and
loan amounts can be more than $2 million. The loan amount limits do vary by county,
but that’s a lot of wiggle room to find a property!

Crunching the numbers
When you’re in the market for a multifamily property (of whatever
size), carefully analyze the following numbers:
 Annual income: Calculate what the total annual income
would be if all the units were rented out for all 12 months.
(Keeping all the units rented can be costly in both time and
effort, but for the purposes of these calculations, assume that
all units are rented out.)
 Annual expenses: Include taxes, insurance, maintenance,
landscaping, management, telephone, utilities — everything
except the loan payment, which comes into play later. Tally up
the expenses for all units for all 12 months of the year.
 Annual repair/replacement expense: In rental units, you
need to replace refrigerators, stoves, carpet, and other fix-
tures on a regular schedule. The easiest way to calculate the
annual repair/replacement expense is to estimate the expense
for a single unit at about $200 per year and multiply that by
the number of units. For a 20-unit property, you can expect to
pay about $4,000 annually in repair and replacement costs.
For a more accurate estimate, calculate the repair and
replacement costs of all fixtures in each unit. For example, the
average life of a refrigerator is seven years. For a 12-unit prop-
erty, that’s 12 refrigerators over the course of seven years, or
about 1.7 refrigerators per year. If you estimate the cost of a
refrigerator at $500, that works out to $850 per year.
 Annual mortgage payments: Use a mortgage calculator to
figure the monthly loan payment including principal and inter-
est. Multiply the monthly loan payment by 12 to determine
the annual cost of the loan.
Up to this point, you have a bunch of meaningless numbers. The
following formula shows you how to use these numbers to make a
well-informed purchase decision.
Say you’re looking at a 12-unit property that you’re pretty sure you
can purchase for $785,000. You do the calculations explained ear-
lier and come up with the following results:
 Annual income: $120,000
 Annual expenses: $23,180
 Annual repair/replacement expense: $2,520
 Annual mortgage payments: $55,296
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
138

Now you’re ready to crunch the numbers. Start with the total
annual income (all units together) and subtract all the expenses to
determine the property’s potential annual cash flow. Here’s how it
works in our example:
$120,000 – $23,180 – $2,520 – $55,296 = $39,004
The $39,004 represents a return of slightly less than 5 percent:
$39,004 ÷ $785,000 = 4.97 percent
If you can bump up the rent, lower expenses, or figure out other
creative ways to increase the annual income by being a savvy land-
lord, you can improve your return on your investment.
This less-than-5-percent return represents only the minimum
return you’re getting. Your actual return on your investment is
likely to be much greater when you take the following into account:
 You’re not paying cash for the property. Say you put 25 per-
cent down on the property and borrowed the rest. Your total
investment isn’t $785,000 but rather $196,250 (25 percent of
$785,000). Divide that $39,004 by $196,250 rather than
$785,000 and you quickly see that your actual annual return is
a more like 20 percent!
 The calculations don’t include appreciation. If property values
increase, you stand to earn even more when you ultimately
sell the property (although you can’t always count on that).
Buying and Renting Out Office
Space: The A-to-D Grading Scale
If midnight calls from tenants about clogged toilets aren’t your cup
of tea, you may want to look at investing in office properties.
Although the risk is a little greater — people don’t really need an
office as they do a home, which could result in greater vacancies
during economic slowdowns — this option offers plenty of perks. It
also comes with a whole new set of income streams and expenses.
If the idea of renting office space to businesses appeals to you,
start looking for opportunities. (For tips on finding great proper-
ties, check out Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies by
Peter Conti and Peter Harris.)
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 139

Lenders break down office properties into different grades on an A
through D basis. The nice new shiny office complex out by the new
shopping mall is the star pupil, earning an A for attracting high-
rent tenants and commanding higher rents per square foot. The
120-year-old building in the heart of the downtown warehouse dis-
trict may be lucky to squeak by with a D both in terms of pricing
and risk. Although different lenders may grade properties differ-
ently, the grading is typically pretty consistent — it’s based on
area, age of building, condition, and quality of tenancy (reflected in
square footage income).
The higher grade the property, the easier it is to get that property
financed. You have more lenders and more options to choose from.
As you go down the scale, credit tightens and interest rates rise.
Reserve and maintenance costs also go up. Another problem is
that many older office buildings aren’t up to current code require-
ments. If the building lacks a sprinkler system, for example,
lenders don’t even consider financing the purchase.
Before giving careful consideration to an office building, check with
your commercial mortgage broker or real estate agent to see what
the property’s grade is right upfront. Generally speaking, we rec-
ommend that you invest in A and B grade properties. Some
investors like the C and D properties because they’re less expen-
sive both to purchase and maintain — tenants don’t expect the
floors to reflect like glass. Just be aware that renting these lower-
graded properties may be more challenging.
Investing in Retail Real Estate
Retail properties include strip malls, small convenience stores,
single-tenant-occupied (STO) properties such as big-box stores, and
even large retail malls. These units can all be great investments,
particularly for those who already run a retail operation and want
to offset their own operational expenses — sort of like owning a
multifamily property and living in one of the units rent-free.
The calculations for evaluating these investments are the same as
those you’d use to evaluate other commercial properties, but the
line items for income and expenses differ, as we reveal in the fol-
lowing sections.
If you own a retail operation and buy a property, put the property
in a separate LLC and then charge yourself rent. You can then
deduct 100 percent of the rent as a business expense. (If you own
the building, you have to calculate depreciation, reducing your

write-offs.) Your attorney can prepare the necessary documenta-
tion and ensure that all the pieces are in order.
Collecting your cut of gross sales
Income on retail property is essentially the same as income you
can expect from an office building (see “Estimating the Income
Potential of a Commercial Property” earlier in this chapter), with
one major difference: With retail property, you can expect an addi-
tional bonus — a percentage of gross sales.
Owners of mid-size to large retail centers commonly charge ten-
ants a percentage of their sales as part of their leases. This prac-
tice makes sense; after all, you’re boosting each merchant’s sales
by offering a convenient place with a high profile to attract shop-
pers. You’re investing in additional repairs and signage and con-
necting merchants with other high-profile tenants. You earn a
percentage of those sales.
When you’re estimating the income potential of your commercial
property, be sure to include commissions as part of the property’s
income. See “Estimating the Income Potential of a Commercial
Property” near the beginning of this chapter for details. For more
about charging tenants a percentage of their sales, check out
Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 141
Charging for consumer traffic
As the owner of a retail center, you’re at least partially responsible for attracting
the consumer traffic that drives sales. Consider an airport, for example. A major air-
port attracts hundreds of thousands of people every day, and airport executives
know that this consumer traffic is a commodity they can sell to merchants looking
for store space and advertising.
Most airports have stores and restaurants. Sure, most of the merchants pay a set
monthly fee as part of their rent, but the airports usually collect significantly more
money by charging merchants a percentage of their gross sales.
In the same way, a small kids’ clothing store is going to attract much more traffic if
it’s in the same strip mall that includes a major retailer. By charging a percentage
of the clothing store’s sales, the strip mall owner is charging the store a premium for
the right to coexist with this consumer-traffic magnet.
Remember, if you have retail property in a great location, you’re probably paying a
premium price for it. To help offset the cost and make your property a better income
generator, don’t hesitate to charge your tenants a higher percentage of sales.

Comparing strip malls and 
convenience stores
Retail strip malls (sometimes known as strip centers) that contain
between 4 and 20 individual or combined storefronts can be a
great investment. Lenders love these types of properties, espe-
cially newer buildings located in high-traffic areas because they’re
relatively much less risky. Convenience stores, also referred to as 
C-stores (places where you can usually get a soda or a bag of chips
at any time of the day or night) can also be good investments and
attractive to lenders because they tend to stay in business longer
than most other stores.
Lenders want to see the income and expense numbers (which the
seller should be able to supply), as well as market data showing
retail traffic patterns and area growth. Also ask for tax returns on
the business so you can verify what the seller tells you. For data on
traffic patterns and area growth, check with your local chamber of
commerce, commercial real estate agents, visitor and convention
bureaus, or economic development departments.
Be very careful about investing in a C-store that functions (or for-
merly functioned) as a gas station. The environmental risks are too
great for most lenders, so these properties are almost impossible
to finance. If you’re considering such a property, check with your
broker first to locate a current source of funding before you make
an offer. For additional details, refer to “Gas stations” later in this
chapter.
Running Your Own Hotel or Motel
If the movie Psycho didn’t scare you clear of your dreams of
becoming the owner and manager of a local hotel or motel, maybe
we can do it for you. You really need to know what you’re doing in
this arena to be successful — it’s not for the faint of heart.
If you really want to get involved in these sorts of properties, con-
sider investing in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that spe-
cializes in hotels and motels to get your feet wet. Doing so spreads
out the risk and allows you to get much-needed experience before
venturing out on your own.
Still interested? Keep in mind that fewer lenders are eager to
finance the purchase of hotels and motels, and those who are will-
ing to consider it want to see stronger numbers than they’d require
for multifamily, office, or retail properties. The risks are greater to
the lender, so they want to see that the property has a greater
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
142

profit potential. The good news is that the reward should be better
for you as an investor.
In the following sections, we bring you up to speed on the basics of
evaluating hotels and motels.
Distinguishing between flagged and
unflagged properties
When you’re in the market for a hotel or motel, keep in mind the
differences between flagged and unflagged properties:
 Flagged: Properties associated with a national chain or 
franchise.
 Unflagged: Independently operated hotels or motels not 
connected with a national chain or franchise.
Lenders prefer flagged properties because they tend to carry less
risk. In the following sections, we break down the differences in
greater detail.
Flagged properties
Flagged properties are premium real estate for several reasons,
including the following:
 They generally have higher occupancy rates.
 They offer greater support in the form of national reservation
systems, online booking, payment-processing systems, group
reservations, and many other benefits.
 Consumers know what to expect and, as a result, are less hesi-
tant to book a room. (On the flip side, you may have to jump
through hoops to meet the strict set of criteria set by higher-
end chains.)
 You may be able to finance the purchase directly through the
chain itself under certain conditions. If not, guarantees and
concessions from the chain can improve your chances of
obtaining attractive financing.
Amenities, age, location, proximity to other chain properties, man-
agement, and the property’s physical condition all play a part in
how lenders flag a property and how it performs financially.
Make sure you work with a commercial loan broker who has
access to specific hotel/motel lenders.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 143

Unflagged properties
Due to their lack of national exposure and support, unflagged prop-
erties are much more difficult to finance. Lenders take a very criti-
cal approach to the income and expense numbers, especially if you
have little or no experience in running successful hotel or motel
establishments.
The only real advantage of owning an unflagged property is that
you don’t have to pay national franchising fees. Other than that,
unflagged properties offer no clear advantages.
Encountering income challenges
When dealing with hotel and motel properties, expect to face a
whole new set of income and expense categories, including the 
following:
 Convention tax or visitors fee: Taxes may be computed differ-
ently based upon occupancy numbers. In addition, trans-
portation such as airport shuttles, taxis, or bus service may
affect the rates.
 Use fees: Resorts that use other public or private amenities
such as lakes, health clubs, casinos, parks, or nature pre-
serves may also be subject to use fees or membership
requirements.
 Costs of meeting government requirements: Bed-and-
breakfasts (known as B and Bs) have to be careful of zoning
restrictions, business licenses, and health department
requirements. Because most of these businesses are 
residential-turned-commercial properties, the property may
be subject to additional upgrades such as Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements or expensive sprinkler
system installations.
As a general rule, hotel/motel properties pose greater risk to the
lender and require a higher Debt Service Coverage Ratio, or DSCR.
DSCR is the number that lenders use to evaluate the risk versus
the rewards. To calculate the DSCR, you first need to calculate the
property’s NOI, as discussed in Chapter 3. Divide the NOI by the
annual debt service on the loan (total annual payments on the
loan, including interest and principal). If, for example, a property
has an NOI of $60,000 and the total loan payments for the year are
$50,000, the DSCR is $60,000 ÷ $50,000, which equals 1.20. A DSCR
of 1.00 means that the property is breaking even. Typical DSCRs
are between 1.04 and 1.50. A hotel/motel would need to come in
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
144

about 1.30 to get approved in today’s market (a slow market at the
time of writing this book).
The higher the ratio, the better the deal — and the better the
financing options. Ask the lender or loan officer about the DSCR
requirements for the types of properties that interest you. This can
keep you from wasting time on properties that don’t come near to
meeting the lender’s DSCR requirements.
Checking Out Industrial or
Warehouse Properties
At first glance, you may think that industrial or warehouse proper-
ties are the simplest investments to finance and manage, but they
come with their own challenges. In the following sections, we
explore the unique costs you’re likely to encounter, introduce stor-
age facility opportunities, and warn you about zoning and use
issues related to these types of properties.
You can finance the purchase of industrial and warehouse proper-
ties through a variety of lenders, but as with any type of commer-
cial property, the numbers need to work. Consult with a broker
who can put you in touch with the right lenders and assist you in
crunching the numbers.
For any industrial or warehouse type of facility, make sure to check
with the local building department and zoning board to under-
stand the present zoning restrictions, limitations on use, and any
grandfather clauses in place under present operations. Those regu-
lations can change with a change in ownership, and you don’t want
to get caught by surprise!
Calculating income and costs
With industrial and warehouse properties, you calculate rent and
income on a square-foot basis, just as you do with retail space.
Multiply the net rental square footage by the annual rental income
per square foot to estimate your annual rental income from the
property.
Expense categories are generally much different, however, and
include purchase and maintenance of loading docks, forklifts,
major heating and cooling systems, truck bays, and structural
components.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 145

Some industrial properties also lend themselves to special permits,
wastewater discharge requirements, and neighborhood noise
restrictions. Check all the regulations before proceeding with an
investment of this nature.
Considering storage facilities
Those self-storage facilities that blemish the U.S. landscape rarely
seem so ugly to investors because they can be great investments.
They enable you to spread the risk among dozens or even hundreds
of tenants and require little maintenance (and no refrigerators to
replace). Income is straightforward on a per-unit, per-month basis,
and expenses are limited mostly to external maintenance issues.
Check with your commercial loan broker to connect with lenders
who specialize in financing the purchase of self-storage units.
Exploring Mixed-Use Properties
Mixed-use properties are those that combine any of the functions
covered previously in this chapter; for example, a multifamily
apartment that includes a grocery on the first floor or an office
complex that has retail shopping inside.
Financing for mixed-use properties can become rather compli-
cated. Lenders who provide financing for office buildings may lose
interest if you’re planning to add a restaurant, making it a riskier
proposition. As the risk to the lender rises, loan costs and interest
rates rise accordingly, and you need to budget for them.
When evaluating the income and expenses, break out each portion
separately and then combine the totals. This practice allows you to
change the lender package easily, if necessary, to illustrate different
tenancy income/expense flows or restructure the transaction.
Sampling Some Special Use
Properties
With all the different types of properties out there, some just don’t
fit into any square box like the rest. These are known as special use
properties. Common special use properties include restaurants and
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
146

bars, gas stations, and adult foster care facilities. We cover financ-
ing considerations for these beasts in the following sections.
More specialized properties in this category include churches,
casinos, theme parks, golf courses, and bowling alleys, which are
all too specialized for us to cover in this book. Check out
Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies to get a complete
picture of what properties like these really entail.
Special use properties are much more difficult to finance and
require special lenders and preparation. For all practical purposes,
novice investors would do best to steer clear of these properties.
Restaurants and bars
Although lenders are just as likely as anyone else to eat out or
drop in at the local watering hole, they generally avoid financing
restaurants and bars. Almost all these establishments fail within
five years, leaving lenders to deal with the hangovers.
The exception would be for an established franchise (or flagged)
property with a proven track record, or destination-type proper-
ties such as a Chuck E. Cheese or a microbrewery (and no, you
can’t combine those two!)
If you’re committed to buying a restaurant or bar, your best bet for
obtaining financing is through hard-money lenders (see Chapter 11),
seller financing (also see Chapter 11), or local banks (not likely), in
that order.
Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 147
Look that gift horse in the mouth
I (Chip) once financed a property for an industrial manufacturing company that was
given a new piece of equipment by General Motors. Nice gift — it was worth well
more than $1 million. The catch was that the warehouse floor had to be rebuilt with
a six-foot concrete slab! Yes, it was quite expensive.
The take-home lesson is this: Budget for your expenses upfront. If I hadn’t budgeted
for this expense, it would have been a hidden expense that could have really taken
a chunk out of my bottom line.

Gas stations
A few lenders out there take chances on financing gas stations, but
the station must be newer and have EPA-certified tanks (as opposed
to the old steel tanks that may end up leaking).
Due to the possibility of past tank leakage and the environmental
issues and cleanup costs associated with contaminated soil, most
lenders don’t consider financing these properties. Inexperienced
investors should avoid these types of properties, too. Even proper-
ties now used for something else (but with a history of under-
ground gas or oil storage tanks) pose a problem for an investor
seeking financing. It’s not impossible, but it’s definitely a much
bigger challenge.
Financing often is available through the distributor (such as Shell
or Sunoco). Options are much better if the station is combined
with a convenience store or fast-food operation.
Adult foster care
With the graying of America, demand has increased for adult foster
care, but these properties can be difficult to finance and come with
their own set of legal and practical challenges. Some national
lenders may be willing to do the deals, but do your homework to
protect your interests and those of the lender. Check zoning require-
ments, ADA and licensing requirements, and state health records for
histories of violations, sanctions, or limited use restrictions.
Group homes and primary child-care facilities are treated the same
way, and the same lenders are the primary source of financing for
these properties. A residential home in which the homeowner runs
a small part-time day care facility wouldn’t be subject to these
guidelines; instead, it would be eligible for standard residential
financing (as long as the day care constituted less than 25 percent
of the total use).

W
hen financing commercial property you can’t always find
money in the usual places. In some cases, for example, you
may be able to obtain loans for commercial properties that are
secured by the Small Business Administration (SBA). You can’t get
that money when you’re buying houses! In other cases, you may be
able to combine a few sources to get a project off the ground —
perhaps purchasing the property with a commercial loan and then
fixing it up with a rehabilitation loan.
If you want to purchase a commercial property, you need a firm
grasp on the financing options available to you. In this chapter, we
lead you on a quest for cash to finance your acquisition and devel-
opment of commercial properties. When you’re aware of all the dif-
ferent programs available, you can then begin to mix and match to
come up with your own creative financing plans.

Sizing Up Various Commercial
Loan Programs
When you’re searching for a commercial loan, the resources aren’t
nearly as useful as when you’re buying a home to live in. Sure, you
can (and should) trek down to your local bank to see what it has to
offer or dial up the lender that currently services the mortgage on
your two-family unit for a quick source of financing. They may be
able to assist you, but in all likelihood, commercial lending isn’t
their specialty, and it’s likely to end up costing you more — both in
money and hassles — than other alternatives.
You may be better off dealing with lenders who specialize in financ-
ing commercial real estate deals. In addition to having a clearer
understanding of your goals, these lenders know what’s available
and reasonable in the current market. When choosing a commer-
cial loan program, you have three options: middle market, hard
money, and conduit loans. The following sections describe these
three options.
Exploring the middle market (local
and national banks)
Local and regional banks comprise the middle market — lenders
who deal in loan amounts from $50,000 to $2 million. Although
your bank may not be the best place to score a commercial loan
(depending on market conditions), it’s one of the best places to
begin your search. Local and regional banks love to find quality
projects in their areas because they can evaluate and monitor the
risk and performance much more easily.
Pros
Financing your commercial venture through a local bank offers sev-
eral distinct advantages:
 You have many lenders to choose from.
 A bank may be willing to consider unique or complex deals.
 A bank is more likely than a conduit lender to accept lower
loan amounts — typically starting as low as $50,000.
 You may be able to work with your bank to combine other
types of financing, such as loans that use inventory or operat-
ing capital as collateral. (See “Considering other potential
sources of capital” later in this chapter for details.)
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
150

Cons
Because banks tend to be more averse to risk than other types of
lenders, financing through a bank has several potential drawbacks:
 Interest rates and terms are higher.
 A bank is likely to require that you move all your accounts
(personal savings account, business accounts, and so on) to
its institution.
 A bank may not be willing to approve large loans.
 Banks can change the type of properties they’re willing to
finance on very short notice.
Pitching your deal to the bank
Taking out a commercial loan through a bank requires that you
proceed through entirely different channels than you’re accus-
tomed to. Start with the bank’s manager, who can refer you to one
of the bank’s commercial loan officers.
Most commercial loan officers are paid on commission — which
works to your advantage. They get paid only if and when you get
the loan, so they’re motivated to make it work. Spend some time
getting to know the loan officer. Ask for his input on how to struc-
ture the deal. Ask for a commercial loan package, or at least how
he wants the information presented.
The only thing that matters in getting the deal done is the num-
bers. Yes, you need to demonstrate that you’re a strong borrower
with good credit, cash in the bank, and a solid investment back-
ground, but in the end, these qualities only reinforce the decision.
Eighty to 90 percent of the decision hinges on the property’s num-
bers. Be prepared with an income statement for the property, rent
rolls, balance sheets, tax returns, bank statements, personal finan-
cials, and a resume — the loan officer wants to see that you have
the skills and experience to handle the transaction.
Hitting up the private sector: 
Hard-money lenders
Thanks to the mortgage meltdown that started in 2008, hard
money may be the only money you can get your mitts on for some
deals. Hard-money lenders are private individuals, finance groups,
and small- to mid-size specialty finance companies that concen-
trate on lending money to real estate investors.
Going the hard-money route has its advantages and disadvantages.
Check out Chapter 11 for the complete lowdown on hard money.
Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 151

Financing Main Street property 
with Wall Street money
Using commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS for short),
conduit lenders provide financing through Wall Street investment
firms to commercial real estate investors. The lenders allot the
funds in huge pools based on the type of investment property —
retail, office, multifamily housing, and so on — and they rate the
securities based on their risk and performance.
Conduit lenders typically deal only with high-quality borrowers and
properties — and in larger loan amounts. These loans are most suit-
able (and only available) for large multifamily projects (200+ units),
shopping centers, large office complexes, and similar types of prop-
erties. You must have a good track record for making payments and
a proven ability to make profitable commercial investments.
Pros
Financing commercial real estate ventures through conduit loans
offers several advantages:
 Financing is readily available.
 Interest rates and terms are more attractive than with other
forms of financing.
 Financing terms and property requirements are more stan-
dardized and predictable.
 You have numerous lenders to choose from.
Cons
Conduit loans aren’t always a viable (or the most attractive) form
of financing for commercial ventures. Here are some of the reasons:
 Minimum loan amounts are typically $2.5 million or more.
 To qualify, you must have very strong credit and show that
the property has a solid cash flow potential.
 Property standards are very specific with regard to higher
quality, income performance, and newer construction stan-
dards, which can exclude many properties from consideration.
 If you sell or refinance the property before the term is up, you
may face stiff prepayment penalties.
 Older properties or ones located in more run-down or neg-
lected areas of town typically aren’t eligible.
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
152

With the collapse of several large Wall Street investment firms in
2008 (including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and others), con-
duit options are becoming scarce and very picky.
Tracking down conduit lenders
Finding large conduit lenders can be tricky. They work only
through commercial mortgage lenders and brokers, so the best
place to start is with an experienced commercial broker.
Get some referrals from your state mortgage association or ask
experienced real estate developers in your area. Another option is
to do a little research down at your county recorder’s office. Look
up and contact the lender of record for a large complex. In most
cases, the lender won’t work with you directly but can refer you to
one of its local or regional lending reps.
Prepping for your first meeting
When dealing with conduit lenders, you’re playing in the major
leagues and dealing with big money, so be prepared. A good loan
rep can help you put together an Executive Loan Summary (ELS)
that lays out the entire proposal. Concentrate on the numbers.
Make sure you know them inside and out, and have all the data to
back up why this property makes financial sense. You need to sell
it to the rep before it goes to the underwriter.
Pursuing Government Loans
Only one person in this country has an endless supply of money.
No, it’s not Bill Gates or even Warren Buffet. It’s your rich Uncle
Sam, who has his own printing press specifically designed to churn
out those greenbacks. When credit is tight, Uncle Sam actively tries
to stimulate the economy by making money available to investors
and developers just like you.
Several agencies help Uncle Sam make money more available,
including the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and the Small
Business Administration (SBA). In the following sections, we
explore these options and other related opportunities.
Financing housing and medical
facilities through FHA loans
When most people hear about FHA financing, they assume it’s
related to government-secured loans for buying single-family
homes like we discuss in Chapter 5. However, FHA also insures
Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 153

financing for the purchase or development of multifamily homes
(at least 100 units) and medical facilities.
To pursue this source of financing, track down a commercial FHA
lender (not a residential lender). FHA-approved commercial
lenders are scarce, but you can locate them by talking to a local
commercial loan officer or searching online for “HUD multifamily
financing.”
Only a handful of commercial lenders are FHA approved. Make
sure you check them out thoroughly online and through HUD by
calling the HUD regional office listed on the Web site (www.hud.
gov). Ask how long the lender has been approved and whether it
has any sanctions against it. (From HUD’s home page, navigate to
the Multifamily Industry page to access information specifically for
commercial topics. For descriptions of multifamily housing pro-
grams, go directly to www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/progdesc/
progdesc.cfm.)
After you’ve found an FHA-approved commercial lender, present
the property you’re planning to purchase and ask for a quote. If the
property qualifies, you may also be eligible for Section 8 housing
payment guarantees. With these guarantees in place, the govern-
ment makes up the difference if you lease to low-income renters
and they can’t pay the rent.
Tapping into economic development
funds and grants
Many states and large cities provide financing for real estate prop-
erties as part of an economic development fund or grant. Usually
restricted to downtown development areas or revitalization dis-
tricts, these loans can come with low interest rates, low costs, and
some nice perks, such as tax abatements or investment incentives.
Transforming abandoned warehouses into fashionable loft apart-
ments or rehabbing run-down brownstone apartments are perfect
candidates for these types of financing programs.
If you’re looking at commercial property located in a revitalization
district, contact the state housing authority and the city or county
economic development office to find out how to tap into these
financing sources.
Securing a loan through the SBA
SBA-insured loans are a great way to finance the purchase of a
building that houses business owners and can even be used to
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
154

finance start-up capital and inventory. Many self-owned restau-
rants, bars, grocery stores, and other businesses are financed
through SBA programs 7(a) and 504, as discussed in the following
sections.
The SBA requires a personal guarantee from every borrower, doesn’t
offer 100 percent financing, and provides outright grants only to
nonprofit organizations. We can’t really recommend one program
over the other, because they both have pros and cons and are used
for quite different situations (as discussed in the following sections).
The best way to evaluate the two options is to obtain quotes from
lenders that compare the numbers side by side specifically related
to your property and financing needs.
For more detailed information on obtaining one of these loans, go
to www.sba.gov or check out the online presentation of the pro-
gram at www.sba.gov/services/financialassistance/
index.html. Most SBA loans are provided through local and
regional banks, so start there.
SBA’s 7(a) loan program
The 7(a) is the most common SBA-insured loan available. You can
use it for an existing or new business, and it can include acquisi-
tion of land, buildings, machinery, furniture, supplies, inventory,
working capital, or even buying the business itself. Following are
the rules governing eligibility:
 Limited to businesses with fewer than 100 employees (500 for
manufacturing companies).
 Can’t have more than $21 million in annual sales ($17.5 million
for construction companies).
 Term can be up to 25 years (10 years for working capital).
 Rates are market rate — usually adjustable tied to the prime
rate (the rate that banks charge one another).
 Guaranteed amount to the bank or lender is typically 
75 percent and limited to $1.5 million per business.
SBA’s 504 loan program
The 504 program is an economic development program designed to
stimulate the economy and create new jobs. Here are the eligibility
rules:
 Minimum 10 percent contribution required by Certified
Development Company (CDC) or from the borrower.
 Must create or retain 1 job per $35,000 of SBA support.
Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 155

 Business plan must demonstrate that the loan will support
local economic growth through new jobs, manufacturing, or a
type of business that will attract other industry.
 Ideal candidates for these types of loans include companies
involved in high-tech development, green-energy research and
development, or experimental medical technologies.
 Similar to the 7(a) program, the interest rate and term is close
to other market rates and programs, and is tied to an index
such as the prime interest rate. Other local or state grant pro-
grams may also be available for part of the financing to reflect
a lower blended interest rate.
Harvesting investment capital
through the USDA
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does a lot more than
inspect chickens and cows and make sure your milk gets pasteur-
ized. It also works hard to encourage investment in agriculture and
related activities. As such, it often finances a variety of projects —
from warehouses to high-tech research facilities — through its
Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan (B&I loan). The B&I loan is
designed for real estate, equipment, working capital, and refinanc-
ing non-farm operations.
The one major requirement for a B&I loan is that the property has
to be located in a rural area (or city with fewer than 50,000
people). Other conditions include the following:
 Loan amounts are between $1 million and $10 million.
 Loans require a guarantee program similar to the SBA’s. (See
“Securing a loan through the SBA” earlier in this chapter.)
 Loans are offered at market rates and terms.
Unlike FHA and SBA loans, these loans actually go directly through
the USDA. It may refer you to one of its bank partners, but it can
and does handle most loans directly. Contact a regional district
office to obtain a loan package and detailed requirements. One
problem with these loans is that the USDA has only so much fund-
ing available and can actually run out of funds until the govern-
ment’s new fiscal year provides a fresh appropriation.
The USDA offers several other grant programs and minority busi-
ness finance programs. For more information, visit www.rurdev.
usda.gov/rbs/busp/b&i_gar.htm.

156

Getting a hold of a CDBG
Community development block grants (CDBGs) are available to
investors for acquiring and rehabilitating commercial properties in
run-down areas.
To qualify for a CDBG, you need to write a grant proposal, which
can be complicated. Every grant has unique requirements in
respect to forms, time frame, type of properties, program guide-
lines, and approval. Network with other real estate investors to find
someone who’s participated in a recently approved grant and ask
for his or her assistance. You may need to hire someone who really
knows the system. (For more about writing grants, check out Grant
Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Beverly A. Browning [Wiley].)
In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), established in
1977, requires lenders to invest locally. For these types of projects,
your property must be associated with a nonprofit organization or
be serving an underserved segment of the local market. Inner-city,
community-group, and nonprofit projects are perfect fits.
Every bank has to provide a certain amount of CRA funding each
year, depending on its size and lending area. The loans are usually
tied to specific types of properties or groups, including minorities,
community groups, Habitat for Humanity, and so on. The bank 
usually wants some good PR out of it (although it rarely says so).

What exactly does FHA do?
As part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FHA has
been lending money to finance both large and small housing projects since the
1930s. Its primary goal is to assist in making affordable housing available for U.S.
citizens, which also helps stimulate the economy.
Technically speaking, the FHA doesn’t really lend money. It insures loans from banks
and other qualified lending institutions. This insurance is great for lenders, because
it enables them to lend money with confidence, knowing that if the borrower defaults
on the loan, the FHA will step in and cover any loss. It’s great for borrowers, too,
because it gives them access to lower-cost loans at greater LTVs than banks would
normally consider. (Check out Chapter 3 for more on LTV.)
It’s a true win-win!

Deconstructing Construction Loans
Prior to mid-2008, new construction was big business, and construc-
tion loans were readily available. The market meltdown changed all
that. Now when you apply for a construction loan, all the lenders
see is risk with a capital R. (A construction loan is one that’s used to
finance the development of new homes or buildings. The big differ-
ence between construction loans and other real estate loans is that
you don’t get the money all at once. Instead, the bank doles out the
cash when each phase of the project is completed and passes
inspection.)
Due to recent credit changes, construction loans are harder to come
by for commercial projects. Technically, these loans are still avail-
able, but you’d better have a strong package to get the funding.
Before you even think about sitting down with prospective lenders,
put together a pro forma — a document/report that projects the
income and expenses for at least a three-year period after comple-
tion (refer to Chapter 8). You should also have a contingency plan
in place if the numbers don’t hit expectations.
Here’s some of what you can expect when pursuing a construction
loan:
 Short term loans — typically only up to three years
 Financing only on strong projects with proven income streams
 Lower LTVs with strong borrower credit requirements and
personal guarantees
In a soft (slumping) market, you need to show that whatever you’re
planning to build is almost guaranteed to generate a positive cash
flow. Be prepared to provide complete blueprints and construction
specifications, a completion timeline, and occupancy projections,
as well as pre-lease agreements. Some lenders require that a build-
ing be more than 75 percent pre-leased before construction can begin.
Financing Fixes with 
Rehabilitation Loans
Securing financing for a fixer-upper is often easier than convincing
a lender to bankroll an entirely new building — as long as the num-
bers come out right. Rehabilitation loans involve properties that
will maintain at least 25 percent of the existing structure. The 
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
158

projects can involve a total do-over (essentially gutting the property)
or just a quick fix-up job.
Middle-market local and regional banks are the best bet for rehab
loans. Call and talk to one of the bank’s commercial loan reps to
see whether it does rehab loans and what its specific LTV and pro
forma requirements are. Many banks shy away from these loans
during market slowdowns unless they’re presented with a very
strong deal.
After you’ve scoped out some lenders who do rehabilitation loans,
you need to crunch the numbers to prove that your project is a
money-maker. Draw up a comprehensive plan that includes a
breakdown of all improvements and materials, blueprints, and
specifications. Include a pro forma, as discussed in the previous
section, showing the return on the investment. If you can’t show a
positive cash flow without fudging the numbers, don’t do the deal.
Don’t over-improve yourself out of a profit. Spending $550,000 on a
building where the leases are fixed for the next three years makes
no sense. Be sure you can recover your investment in a reasonable
amount of time.
Exploring Other Creative 
Financing Options
Taking out a loan is the most obvious way to finance your commer-
cial real estate venture, but it’s certainly not the only way. Other
individuals and organizations have money to lend or invest. If you
can’t find the money through traditional sources, consider the
more creative financing options covered in the following sections.
Borrowing from pension programs
and life insurance companies
Pension programs and life insurance companies have large pools
of cash available for investing. Much of this cash is invested in
stocks and bonds, but many fund managers actively look for real
estate investments to provide better returns than they can get in
the traditional markets:
 Pension programs generally prefer conservative, short-term
loans on stable commercial properties such as multifamily
units, retail properties, and resort hotels. The loan amounts
tend to be larger, but they can be flexible on terms and rates.
Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 159

 Life insurance companies also look for more stable deals, but
they can provide a viable alternative to borrowing from 
conduit lenders.
You won’t be able to track down these opportunities by yourself —
you have to work through a commercial lender or broker, just as 
if you were pursuing a conduit loan. See “Financing Main Street
property with Wall Street money” earlier in this chapter for details.
Enlisting the services of 
venture capitalists
Some people have more money than they know what to do with:
the venture capitalists (VCs) — individuals and companies who are
constantly on the lookout for new businesses and innovative tech-
nologies to invest in. Assuming a business or new technology is
promising enough, VCs are willing to finance everything, including
real estate acquisition, redevelopment, and all the costs of starting
and running the business, especially if it involves high-tech, bio-
tech, medical technology, or other innovative operations.
Financing through VCs has advantages and disadvantages just like
any type of financing. The big plus is that they can write big checks.
The major drawback is that you lose a lot of control over your busi-
ness and its operations. If you’re running a high-tech business and
want to purchase real estate as part of the business, however, this
may be the solution for you.
VC firms specialize in niche markets, so talk to business brokers
who specialize in selling businesses within that niche. In other
words, if you’re looking for VCs for a theme restaurant, talk to a
broker who sells theme restaurants or franchises. She can put you
in touch with venture capitalists, but she may charge a finder’s fee.
Grab a copy of Entrepreneur Magazine and flip to the back to find
listings for VC firms. Other publications and newsletters for busi-
ness owners and entrepreneurs often contain similar listings. Start
locally and then go online to research the VCs you turn up through
your local search in depth. After you’ve found a few promising can-
didates, interview them and check references on recent projects
they’ve done to determine their pull-through rate (what they 
actually produce versus what they promise).
Many venture capital firms are equally interested in the overall
concept of the business plan and real estate development as much
as the financial picture. They can be much more flexible on the
returns, especially if the short-term numbers aren’t extremely
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
160

strong but the long-term potential looks great. Make sure your pro
forma is very conservative and extends out at least five years.
Sharing the costs and the equity
Some lenders are willing to loan investors money only if they can
get a little piece of the action — equity in a property. For larger real
estate transactions or very unique situations that involve several
investors, you may want to explore the possibility of some equity-
sharing arrangement by way of an equity loan.
With an equity loan, you actually become partners with the bank or
investor. They provide the financing in exchange for equity in the
building or a portion of the cash flow or the actual business. This
arrangement presents obvious drawbacks in terms of control and
decision-making with regards to the property and its use, but it
also requires you to be more accountable to the transaction.
Consider equity-sharing only as a last resort, unless you’re looking
for partners who can offer you more than money. If you pitch your
plan to the last lender on your list and get a lukewarm “no,” this
usually means that the lender likes the deal, but it’s just bigger than
his budget or appetite. Ask whether he’d be more interested if his
risk and exposure were reduced by bringing in another partner or
lender or giving him a piece of the project. In most cases, the
answer is still “no,” but you never know until you ask.
If you do decide to move forward on such an arrangement, consult
a qualified accountant and an attorney to write up a limited agree-
ment. We recommend limiting your partner’s share to no more
than 49 percent of the outstanding equity. Also include a maximum
five-year buyout provision with a first-right-of-refusal so you can
protect any growth in the equity. See Chapter 13 for more on part-
nerships and partnership agreements.
Participating in participation loans
With a participation loan, several lenders chip in to share the costs,
risks, and potential profits with one another and the borrower/
investor. Participation loans are common in large commercial
transactions that involve community development projects, such
as a hotel attached to a new city convention center.
On these types of loans, several banks or financial institutions pro-
vide a portion of the financing, each taking a piece of the pie. For
example, if no single lender is willing or able to finance the $20 mil-
lion for the deal, they may split it up, with Bank A financing 
Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 161

$10 million, Bank B $6 million, and Bank C $2 million, with the bal-
ance coming from the borrower. In this case, Bank A is the primary
lender, including the primary authority in decision making.
Don’t try to arrange these deals yourself. Enlist the assistance of a
qualified mortgage brokerage or banking firm to bring all the par-
ties together, coordinate efforts, and manage all the in-fighting
that’s likely to occur as the lenders jockey for position.
Taking on a partner
For smaller, simpler commercial real estate acquisitions, you may
want to consider taking on a partner — one who has access to solid
financial resources or the credit needed to qualify for financing.
If you decide to take on a partner, just make sure that all the expec-
tations and responsibilities are clearly laid out — in writing. For
more about partnering, check out Chapter 13.
Considering other potential 
sources of capital
Thanks to the mortgage meltdown and subsequent economic chal-
lenges that began in 2008, you may have to dig deeper to find
financing for your commercial ventures. As you dig, here are a few
other options to consider:
 Franchise financing: Many commercial properties used in
conjunction with a franchise operation are eligible for direct
financing with the parent company. Hotels such as Sheraton
or Holiday Inn, restaurants such as KFC or Applebee’s, or
even a Baskin-Robbins ice-cream shop can find some cheap
money through its franchise operation.
 Inventory loans: If you have a business with a large amount of
inventory, you may be able to use that inventory as collateral
to finance the purchase of the property or at least part of it.
 Accounts receivable: If you’re acquiring a property that serv-
ices a large vendor such as the U.S. government or United
Airlines, you may be able to use the value of future contracts
as collateral for part of the down payment or financing. Some
large companies even provide financing to suppliers for their
production facilities.

Securing a Loan to Finance
Your Commercial Venture
In This Chapter
 Making sense of the broker agreement

 Covering your back with unbiased reports
 Surviving the closing
W
hen you’re borrowing money to buy a home to live in, the
lender wants to know that you’re earning enough money to
make the monthly mortgage payments. The focus is on you and
your finances — how much money you earn, how much cash you
have socked away in the bank, and your track record for paying
your bills on time.
When you’re buying commercial property, the focus shifts. The
lender is less concerned about you and your earning potential and
more concerned about the property’s earning potential. Because of
this difference and others, financing a commercial venture is quite
different from financing the purchase of a residential property.
In this chapter, we lead you through the application and processing
of your commercial loan, so you know what to expect and can avoid
the most common pitfalls.
Deciphering the Broker-
Borrower Agreement
Although you can often deal directly with lenders to finance resi-
dential deals, you usually have to work through a broker or loan
officer on commercial deals. The broker or loan officer acts as the
middleman who puts you in touch with the lender and advises you

Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
164
on which loan programs are best for you and your investment
goals. (See Chapter 4 for more about brokers and loan officers.)
With commercial properties, the broker is likely to require that you
sign a broker-borrower agreement. A good commercial loan broker
is going to do a great deal of work on your behalf to search for,
evaluate, and secure financing for your transaction. He wants to
make sure that you’re going to go through with the deal, so he can
get paid. A well-written agreement also protects your rights.
Although no standard format governs such agreements, all of them
spell out the terms of the agreement, including the following:
 Term of the engagement: The agreement should spell out
how long you’re retaining the broker to represent you. Limit
the term to a period of four to six months. If they haven’t
found any investors for you by then, it’s time to move on.
 Exclusivity clause: A commercial broker may ask for exclusive
rights to represent you, meaning you can’t retain any other
commercial lenders or brokers during that period. Before you
sign the agreement, make sure you’re comfortable with your
selection. If your only broker drops the ball, you may be out of
the game for several months. Try to avoid contracts with an
exclusivity clause, or at least get a clause that lasts no longer
than 90 to 120 days. For particularly large or difficult transac-
tions, you may have to provide a six-month window.
 Loan acceptance terms: Specify the loan terms you’re willing
to accept; for example, you may want to specify a loan that
offers 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) on a 25-year amortization
at 7 percent or better. Don’t set the bar so high, however, that
your loan officer can’t possibly negotiate a deal.
Be careful what you ask for. If your broker finds a loan that
meets the terms you specified, you may be obligated to pay
your broker regardless of whether the deal closes.
 Non-circumvention clause: This part of the agreement pro-
hibits you from cutting your broker out of the deal and deal-
ing directly with the lender. This clause is no biggie because
circumventing your broker is bad business anyway. 
 Compensation: Any broker agreement spells out how much
you’re paying the broker. The fee is completely negotiable, but
expect it to run one to two points (1 or 2 percent) of the deal.
You generally pay a larger percentage for smaller loans and a
smaller percentage for larger loans. Negotiate with the broker
until you’re comfortable with the fee.
 Retainer fee: Except for very small commercial transactions,
most brokers ask for a retainer, which covers his upfront
expenses and ties you to the contract. (An agreement isn’t

very binding if it has no cash tied to it.) In most cases, you
shouldn’t have to pay more than $2,000 — less for smaller
deals and more for larger ones. My (Chip’s) standard retainer
is $2,000, but I’ve collected as much as $10,000 upfront on a
$28 million deal.
Make sure any retainer fee is applied toward the overall com-
pensation. Also ask whether the fee is refundable (usually not)
and under what circumstances.
 Communication: Some agreements spell out specifically how
often you agree to communicate with one another. You should
expect updates from the broker about once a week. The
broker may in turn require that you provide certain documen-
tation within seven days to put together a loan proposal, for
example. This is a reasonable request; you can’t really expect
the broker to draw up a proposal together without it. On the
flip side, the broker should agree to communicate with you on
a regular basis and update you on the status of any loan offers
or commitments.
 Cancellation clause: The cancellation clause stipulates the
conditions under which you or the broker can cancel the
agreement. Make sure the agreement has a clause that enables
you to cancel the agreement if the broker doesn’t deliver sat-
isfactory results in a certain amount of time. For example, if
the broker fails to deliver any financing prospects to you over
the course of a couple of months, you should probably be
looking for the exits. Whatever the clause stipulates, make
sure you understand and agree to it. If a dispute arises, you
can renegotiate parts of the contract, but this is where a
shorter-term agreement can work in your favor; you can
simply let it expire.
Commercial lenders and brokers generally operate with less gov-
ernment oversight. As a result, agreements aren’t required for com-
mercial loan transactions, nor do you see the same disclosures as
in residential transactions. Lenders aren’t required to produce a
Good Faith Estimate (GFE) or Truth In Lending statement. Good
loan brokers, however, want to secure a written agreement with
you to make sure neither of you is wasting the other’s time.
Don’t sign any legally binding agreement without having your
attorney review it first, answer any questions you have about it,
and advise you on the risks and benefits of signing.
Accounting for Upfront Fees
Unfortunately, that retainer you paid the broker in the previous
section covers the broker’s upfront fees, but it does nothing to cover
Chapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 165

your upfront fees. Here are the most common fees and costs you can
expect to encounter when you’re purchasing a commercial property:
 Appraisal fee: Lenders always order an appraisal and make
you pay for it. Although the appraisal isn’t done until the
lender approves your loan request, you may have to pay for it
upfront. Depending on the size and nature of the commercial
property, the appraisal may cost anywhere from $1,500 to
$5,000. For larger, more complex transactions, of course, the
total may be much higher. Ask your loan officer for an esti-
mate upfront.
 Environmental fee: Depending on the type of property, what
it is (and was) used for, or even the surrounding neighbors,
you may need to have the soil tested for contaminants. For
example, if you’re buying property near a defunct industrial
plant or a building that once housed a dry cleaner, the soil
may have toxins. Find out from your loan broker whether
these tests are going to be necessary and obtain an estimate
of the cost.
 Structural inspection: The lender may require certain types of
inspections and engineering reports, which can get very 
expensive — especially for manufacturing facilities. Ask about
the lender’s requirements and obtain an estimate for your area.
 Commitment fee or loan guarantee fee: When the lender
issues a loan commitment or preliminary proposal approval,
it’s going to want you to make a commitment as well. This
request is only fair — the lender is about to spend a lot of
effort evaluating the loan package, underwriting the file,
reserving the funds, and so on, so it needs some assurance
that you’re not going to get cold feet. The lender is likely to
require that you sign a commitment letter and submit a fee as
specified in the letter. You pay this standard, nonrefundable
fee to the lender upon acceptance of the commitment — it
doesn’t go to the broker, nor is it part of the loan amount. The
fee should not exceed one to two percent of the loan amount,
or a few thousand dollars for most transactions.
Before you sign off on the deal (by submitting the commitment
letter), realize that you still have some room to negotiate. In most
cases, the broker expects you to come back with a counteroffer on
the commitment fee or the loan terms offered. Don’t be too pushy
here, though; you don’t want to sink the deal and have to start all
over from scratch. After you have a lender who’s committed,
you’re 75 percent of the way there.
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
166

Obtaining Third-Party Reports
After you obtain a commitment with the lender or investor, you’ve
pretty much entered the final stretch and can be fairly confident
that your deal is going to cross the finish line, but you’re not done
yet. You still need to gather some additional information about the
property to protect both yourself and the investor from taking
ownership of a money pit.
Fortunately, other companies and individuals are well qualified to
gather the necessary information for you and deliver third-party
reports. These reports include
 An appraisal
 A survey
 The property’s title and title history
 An engineering report
 An environmental inspection
In the following sections, we describe these third-party reports in
detail and point out common red flags to watch for.
Verifying a property’s market 
value with an appraisal
When financing a commercial property, the lender or investor
orders a commercial appraisal to answer two important questions:
First, is the property worth the price? Second, can the property
generate more than enough revenue to cover the loan payments?
Although the lender orders the appraisal, you pay for it. After it’s
complete, get a copy for your records, and read it over carefully to
make sure that you’re not making a mistake in moving forward on
the deal. Make sure the appraisal shows that the property’s value
is in line with similar properties and that it has the potential to
generate the income you expect to earn from it. Your financial
backers should sound the sirens if the appraisal shows the deal is
a dud, but your neck is on the chopping block, so perform your
own due diligence as well. The appraisal should simply support
the calculations you’ve already done.
Commercial and residential appraisers differ significantly in terms
of training, experience, and process. A commercial appraisal offers
a comprehensive review of the property, all systems and construc-
tion, and similar types of commercial properties within a certain
Chapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 167

geographical area. It also includes something that residential
appraisals don’t — economic feasibility information. In other
words, does the area really need another retail strip center, or how
does this existing center perform compared to other retail strip
centers in neighboring communities?
In case you’re wondering about having the property inspected, the
appraisal usually serves this purpose, too. On larger commercial
deals, however, the lender’s representative inspects the property
as part of the approval process . . . and, of course, charges you for
that inspection. You can expect the lender to disclose the cost of
any required inspection upfront.
Plotting the perimeter with a survey
Toward the tail end of the loan process, the lender is going to
order a survey, which you usually pay for as part of your closing
costs. The survey shows the property’s boundaries — its perime-
ter. In addition to showing you how much land you own, the survey
provides some assurance that all improvements are located within
the legal boundaries and, more importantly, whether any of your
neighbors’ buildings encroach on your land.
The lender and title company will alert you to any discrepancies or
encroachments (where somebody else’s improvements sit on your
land). Discuss any issues with your broker or loan officer. Serious
problems have to be solved prior to closing.
Ask for a copy of the survey prior to the closing and inspect it
carefully to make sure you understand and approve the boundary
lines. At closing, the title company or closing agent requires that
you sign the survey certifying that you (the borrower) have seen it
and received a copy.
You’ll be asked to sign a copy certifying that you know what you
are buying and what the lender is placing a lien on. If the survey
shows any encumbrances, the lender won’t close it until they’re
cleared up with a recordable easement or agreement with the
other property owner(s). Many times you have “community drive-
ways” that service several businesses, and a separate joint operat-
ing agreement may be in place to maintain that service drive. The
lender will want to see a copy of that too.
Inspecting the title
Early in the process, the loan broker or lender orders a title 
commitment. This commitment provides a legal description of the
property, lists any liens against the property, and stipulates any
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
168

terms or conditions associated with the commercial real estate
located there.
So, why should you care? This document is important because any
or all of this information can ultimately come back to haunt you. If,
for example, other parties have a lien against the property, you may
be responsible for paying that lien if you take possession of the
property. In addition, certain restrictions may limit improvements to
the property or how you can use the property to generate revenue.
Ask for a copy of the title commitment as early on as possible and
review it carefully. If any deed restrictions, operational limitations,
or municipality conditions have been placed on the property, you
need to know about them prior to signing on the dotted line. Some
limitations can completely undermine your plans for the property.
Obtaining an engineering report
Engineering reports focus on the structural integrity of a building
and its proposed use. They may include stress load tests or even
earthquake tests for buildings in active fault zones. For one trans-
action, I (Chip) had to obtain an engineering report on a concrete
slab. The slab was eight feet thick and was supporting a massive
steel stamping machine in automotive production. That report
alone cost several thousand dollars.
Before you get too deep into a deal, find out which engineering
reports are going to be necessary and then obtain cost estimates
on having them done. Lenders may require several of these reports
for a single property depending on its location and proposed use.
You can expect requests for more-detailed reports if you’re pur-
chasing taller buildings or manufacturing facilities.
Get a copy of all reports and review them completely. These reports
may indicate a need for significant (and expensive) structural
repairs that you need to make before you can use the property for
the desired purpose.
Getting a clean bill of 
environmental health
Gas stations, dry cleaners, and car washes are notorious for leeching
toxins into the ground on which they’re situated, so if you’re buying a
piece of property that has (or had) one of these pollution-producers
sitting on it, make sure you have it inspected (or at least purchase
environmental insurance to protect your investment). The last thing
Chapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 169

you want to inherit is a former brownfield site! (See the nearby sidebar
“What or where is Brownfield?” for more information.)
Most commercial transactions simply require environmental insur-
ance coverage similar to title insurance that protects the lender
against any past contaminations. Larger commercial properties
may have to provide a Phase I environmental report, which is a sur-
face level evaluation of the soil. This report costs anywhere from a
couple of hundred bucks to a couple of thousand.
If the Phase I report shows any contaminants, a Phase II is 
necessary — which costs even more. We can’t give you a ballpark
estimate on the cost because it varies depending on the nature of
the contaminants and the size of the parcel subject to the study.
If you have reason to suspect problems with the history of the site,
you can do a little of your own research on the government Web
site at www.epa.gov.
Navigating the Closing
After the lender receives and approves all the third-party reports,
it sends you a final commitment letter signaling the beginning of
the end. This notification gives you and the lender the green light
to proceed to the closing table — the final chapter of the process
(or at least the final section in this chapter).
Protecting yourself with 
title insurance
Every property has a title showing all the parties that have a legal
claim to the property. The list of parties obviously includes the cur-
rent owners, but it can also include lenders from whom the owners
borrowed money, the government (which may lay claim to the prop-
erty for any unpaid taxes), and utility companies (which may lay
claim to the property for any unpaid utility bills).
Before you close on a real estate transaction, make sure you get title
insurance — protection against any financial loss resulting from an
overlooked valid legal claim to the property. Title insurance is even
more important when you’re closing on a commercial transaction
because you usually have a lot more money on the line.
Prior to making an offer on the property, you should have received
a copy of the title commitment and taken care of any issues regard-
ing unresolved property liens. Just prior to closing, however, ask
your title company for an updated title commitment. Check for any
Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 
170

new liens or changes based on the title underwriter’s most recent
research. Be especially careful about tax liens and utility liens
because they transfer with ownership.
Make sure your closing addresses all liens listed on the title. If, for
example, the title shows that a mortgage lender still holds a lien
against the property, make sure the closing is set up in such a way
that the balance of that loan is going to be paid from the proceeds
of the sale. Go over the list of lien holders with your attorney and
title company to be sure that everyone who’s supposed to get paid
at closing does.
Have your attorney review the title documentation in addition to
the Warranty Deed prepared by the seller or the title escrow agent.
Compare the legal descriptions line by line and word for word,
point out any discrepancies (none of which is too small to correct),
and have all issues resolved before closing.
Insuring your property
Prior to the closing, meet with your insurance agent to discuss the
nature of the property and its insurance requirements. Your lender
requires that you have at least enough insurance to cover the
amount of the new loan, but you need even more than that.
Make sure you have enough insurance to cover the replacement cost
of the building(s), including operational systems such as elevators,
HVAC units, pools, laundry facilities, appliances, machinery, and so
on. Also be sure to order enough liability insurance to cover you in
the event of personal injury claims and other lawsuits.
Chapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 171
What or where is Brownfield?
A brownfield site isn’t a specific place. It’s a term used to designate an abandoned
commercial or industrial facility situated on contaminated land or land generally
believed to be contaminated with pollution or hazardous wastes. In many cases,
the owners face a situation in which it would cost them more to clean up the prop-
erty than they would earn from the sale of the restored site, so they choose to leave
it as is.
People who buy brownfield sites (knowingly or unknowingly) also get stuck with the
cleanup bill. This situation is certainly okay as long as you know what you’re getting
into and figure the cleanup costs into your budget. If you don’t make the necessary
budget accommodations, however, you may end up with a useless piece of property
or expenses that completely wipe out your profit.

Have the policy ready to go prior to closing, and make sure it takes
effect on before the closing date and time. Most commercial poli-
cies have an effective time, and you want that time to be the
minute the closing takes place or before.
Attending to existing tenant rights
If you’re buying a rental property that already has tenants in it,
those tenants can make or break your ability to profit from the prop-
erty. Prior to closing, you want to take inventory of your tenants,
check on their status (especially in terms of paying their rent), and
connect with them to ensure a smooth transition from one landlord
to the next. Here’s a checklist to help ensure a smooth transition:
 At or just prior to the closing, ask the seller to execute a cer-
tification of tenancy. This information is your assurance that
you know of all tenants and the conditions of their tenancy.
 For larger commercial properties, obtain an estoppel certifi-
cate from every tenant confirming their position with the
current owner. (Your attorney can supply you with copies of
the certificate.) This certificate confirms all lease terms and
conditions (including monthly payment and security deposit)
and the date on which they made their last payment. Using
the estoppel certificate, you can identify tenants who are
behind on their rents and identify any early payments and
security deposits that the previous owner is holding, so you
can be sure that the money is transferred to you at closing.
 Review all the rent rolls and have the seller certify them at
closing. Retain an original copy of the signed rent roll in case
you need it later if discrepancies arise.
 Account for all security deposits that the seller still holds,
and make sure that the closing statement credits you for
them. If they’re all held in an escrow account, make sure that
they’re transferred to you exclusively.
One of the first things you need to do as the new owner is communi-
cate with your tenants and set the tone for your relationship. If the
property is a large commercial multifamily housing complex, you
may need to do it through a newsletter. For smaller properties, do it
in person. Send a letter of introduction, and schedule an appoint-
ment with each tenant. Don’t just show up on their doorstep.
With permission from the seller, I (Chip) usually try to meet each of
the tenants face to face prior to the closing. This process helps me
get a better feel for the property and what I need to do to address
any tenant concerns right away. It also helps prevent tenant uneasi-
ness that naturally arises when a new owner’s in town — although
the prospect of a new owner may be cause for celebration!

W
hen most people hear the phrase real estate ﬁnanc-

but you — the savvy investor — can get your mitts on
some investment capital in other ways, and in this part,
we show you how.
These options aren’t for everybody, but when you’re in
the market for investment properties and can’t get your
hands on conventional ﬁnancing, these unconventional
sources can really come in handy. In this part, you dis-
cover the pros and cons of what we call hard money —
typically high-cost loans from private lenders. “High cost?”
Why would you want a high-cost loan? We explain the
(pleasantly) surprising reasons this may be a good option.
We also show you how to ﬁnance through the seller by
purchasing properties on contract, how to partner with an
investor who’s cash heavy, and how to track down no-
money-down deals.

Financing in a Pinch with Hard
Money and Other Tough
Options
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether hard money is the option for you
 Minimizing the high cost of hard-money loans
 Discovering sources of hard money (including friends and relatives)
 Covering additional expenses with a line of credit
 Racking up charges on your credit card as a last resort
You just discovered the deal of a lifetime, but your bank won’t
loan you the money, you can’t find a willing partner, and the
owner refuses to finance the purchase. What do you do? You can
give up and wait for another golden opportunity to come your way,
but you don’t want the promise of profit to slip through your fingers
over something as mundane as money.
Another option is to obtain a loan from a private lender — a hard-
money lender. Hard money is called hard because it’s generally
harder to pay back. Loans are short-term, and the lenders tend to
charge a high interest rate plus points (a percentage of the loan
amount) upfront. For the savvy real estate investor, though, access
to cash is often more important than the cost, so when credit is
tight, hard money may be the only option.
We begin this chapter by weighing the pros and cons of hard money
to determine whether it’s an option you want to pursue. We offer a
few suggestions on how to keep the costs down and show you how
to locate hard-money lenders in your market. We also show you
how to tap into other sources of hard cash by borrowing from rela-
tives, taking out a line of credit against the investment property to
cover repair and renovation expenses, and using your credit cards
as a last resort.

176
Although we recommend the hard-money option for situations in
which a bank may turn you down for a loan, keep in mind that
banks may turn you down for good reason — perhaps the invest-
ment is far too risky for them. When banks turn you down, take a
closer look at the numbers. Sometimes, a lost investment opportu-
nity may be the best thing that never happened to you. 
Weighing the Pros and 
Cons of Hard Money
Before you decide to travel the hard-money route, consider the 
following potential benefits and drawbacks so you know what
you’re getting yourself into.
Perusing the pros
Hard money is a high-interest, short-term loan that offers four big
benefits:
 Easy access to cash: You can get your hands on cash you may
not be able to get through a conventional lender.
 Reduced personal risk: You don’t have to borrow against your
own home and place it at risk because hard-money lenders
often accept the future value of a property as collateral, some-
thing of value they can take from you and sell if you happen to
default on the loan.
You can use your own house, possessions, and retirement sav-
ings as collateral, but doing so places your current posses-
sions at risk and can get you into loads of trouble with your
significant other. A safer way to borrow money is through a
hard-money lender who’s willing to accept just the investment
property as collateral.
Don’t give lenders an ownership position by naming them on
the deed, unless you truly want them as a partner. Give them
only a lien holder position in the mortgage document.
 Flexibility in financing repairs and renovations: You can
often set up a separate escrow account with a hard-money
lender to pay for repairs and renovations.
 No extra paperwork: You can get your hands on it fast —
without having to fill out a lot of extra formal paperwork.

Hard-money lenders are often more willing to negotiate with investors,
especially if you have a solid track record of profitable investments
and paying back loans. Remember, these folks earn money from
the risks you take on and the efforts you invest. As long as you’re
successful, you can find people willing to invest in you.
Considering the cons
Now for the bad news. Hard money is called hard for several rea-
sons. Before choosing the hard-money option, be aware of the fol-
lowing key areas of hard-money loans:
 Points or discount points: You can expect to pay anywhere
from two to six points or more for the loan upfront. See
“Calculating points” later in this chapter for details.
 Interest rates: Hard-money lenders often charge nearly double
the interest rates of conventional loans. If the going interest
rate for conventional loans is 6.5 percent, for example, a hard-
money lender may charge 10 to 15 percent. Because hard-
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 177
Hard money by any other name
Although we like the term hard money, others may use other terminology to refer to
this type of financing. Some of these terms apply to other types of financing, as well,
which can get a bit confusing, but don’t be surprised if your lender uses one of the
following terms to refer to the hard-money option: 
 Bridge loan: Because the loan functions as a short-term bridge between not
owning the property and refinancing it later with a long-term loan.
 Equity loan: Because you’re borrowing against the equity of the property you’re
purchasing rather than using your job and income as a way of securing the loan.
(Don’t confuse this with a standard home equity loan, in which you use financ-
ing to pull equity out of a property you own. In this case, you’re essentially
pulling equity out of a home you don’t own so you can afford to buy it.)
 Portfolio loan: Because the lender holds the mortgage instead of selling it on
Wall Street.
 Rehab loan: Because you’re using the loan to purchase and renovate a dis-
tressed property to make it profitable, and the property doesn’t qualify for a reg-
ular loan due to its condition.
 Private financing: Because individuals, rather than institutions, typically make
the loans available.

Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
178
money loans are typically short term, however, you’ll proba-
bly refinance or sell the property long before you rack up a lot
of interest. See “Adding up the interest” later in this chapter
for details.
 Loan-to-value (LTV): Hard-money lenders typically approve you
for a loan of only 65 to 75 percent of the property’s value, not
the typical 85 to 90 percent you can expect from conventional
lenders. However, if you’re buying distressed property for well
below what the value of the property will be after it’s repaired,
this drawback really shouldn’t matter. For example, if you’re
buying a property for 20 to 30 percent below what it will be
worth after you fix it up, your hard-money loan should be able
to cover the full purchase price you’re paying. Still, you may
need additional funds to cover holding and renovation costs.
When buying into a declining market, LTV becomes even more
critical because your loan amount stays the same while hous-
ing values are declining. If the value of the house dips below
what you owe on it, you place yourself in a situation of owing
more on a property than what you can sell it for.
 Amortization: Hard-money lenders often want to amortize the
loan over 5 to 15 years rather than the standard 30 years, which
ends up increasing your monthly payments because you’re
paying down the principal on the loan faster. To lower the
monthly payments, amortize over 30 years or negotiate for
interest-only payments. You want to have enough free-flowing
cash to finance renovations and cover your holding costs.
(See Chapter 6 for more about amortization.)
 Balloon payment: Hard-money loans typically have balloon
payments or cash calls after so many months, so you may be
required to pay off the loan in full in a matter of 6 to 36 months.
This isn’t a problem as long as you have a solid plan in place
and sufficient funds on hand for when the balloon payment is
due. If you don’t, you may end up losing the property when you
can’t make the payments.
 Prepayment penalties: Avoid any loans that stipulate a pre-
payment penalty — extra money you have to pay if you
choose to pay off the loan early — that remains in effect for
more than the first couple years. We’ve seen investors lose
thousands of dollars when they sold a house because they
agreed to pay a 2 to 3 percent prepayment penalty.
 Closing costs: As with any lender, you have to close on a loan
from a hard-money lender. Figure in the cost of the title insur-
ance, closing fee, credit report, and appraisal survey. Be par-
ticularly careful of any discount points or loan origination fees —
these are areas where the lender and mortgage broker can really
jack up the cost of the loan, so ask questions in advance.
Refer to Chapter 6 for more about closing costs and fees.

 Cross collateralization: If you’re investing in two or more prop-
erties, the hard-money lender may want to cross-collateralize
the properties. If you sell one property for a $10,000 profit, for
example, the lender may want to use the profit to pay down the
loan on the other property. This route isn’t terrible — it may
even benefit you by reducing your interest on the second 
loan — but it’s something you should be aware of. Cross collat-
eralization simply secures the lender’s position.
Some hard-money lenders offer something called a bullet loan, in
which you make no monthly payments. Interest accrues and is
rolled back into the loan’s principal, which increases the total
amount required to pay off the loan and can significantly increase
the total amount of interest you end up paying. A bullet loan frees
up your cash flow so you have more money on hand for renova-
tions and other investment properties. However, it can also signifi-
cantly increase your risks, especially if the market heads south
when you’re scheduled to pay back the loan.
Managing the Expense of 
a Hard-Money Loan
Hard-money loans are notorious for costing a lot of money, but just
how much money is a lot? And can you do anything to limit the
expense? In the following sections, we answer these questions by
showing you how to calculate interest over the life of the loan, sub-
tract the amount you save in taxes, and practice two strategies for
slashing the amount you pay in interest.
Calculating points
A point is 1 percent of the loan amount, so if you’re paying six
points on a $200,000 loan, you’re paying $12,000 upfront to get your
mitts on the money. To calculate the total amount of money you’re
paying in points, multiply the total loan amount by the total
number of points by 1 percent or .01:
Loan Amount × Number of Points × .01 = $ Total Points
Some hard-money lenders may agree to refund a point or two if
you pay back the loan on time. If the lender is socking you with a
huge amount of interest in points, consider asking for a refund if
you can pay back the loan on time or early. The sooner the
investor can put that money back in play, the sooner she can col-
lect points from the next borrower.
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 179

Adding up the interest
Calculating the total interest you can expect to pay over the life of
a loan is no different for hard-money loans than it is for conven-
tional loans. To do so, just follow these steps:
1. Multiply the monthly payment by the number of months
you expect to be paying on the loan.
2. Add any balloon payments (or cash calls) you’re required
to make.
3. Subtract the total amount you borrowed.
The remainder is the interest you stand to pay through
your regular payments.
4. Add the total amount you paid upfront in points.
These can be discount points (interest paid upfront) or loan
origination points (fees). Technically, anything calculated as
a percentage of the loan is deductible as far as the IRS is
concerned. From a legal and regulatory perspective, origi-
nation points and discount points differ even though they
function the same.
The resulting number is the total interest paid over the life of the loan.
Interest is only one expense you incur as the price of doing busi-
ness with a lender. The lender or broker who’s handling the trans-
action may charge additional fees. When comparison-shopping for
loans, even hard-money loans, don’t forget to account for these
expenses. For details, refer to Chapter 6.
Subtracting the tax savings
When you’re calculating the cost of money into your equations,
think of your expenses as tax deductions. Keep in mind that you pay
taxes only on your profits, so all expenses you incur — including the
interest you pay on loans — reduce your profits whether you sell
the property or rent it out.
This silver lining doesn’t mean you should rejoice in having to pay
a huge amount in interest and points, but it can alleviate some of
the psychological pain you may feel. If, for example, you sell the
house and have to pay 30 percent in short-term capital gains tax,
the government is essentially covering 30 percent of the interest
you paid on your loan.

180

Paying back the loan sooner 
to save money
Although hard-money loans have a reputation for costing the most
money, you can contain the costs by paying back the loan sooner
rather than later. The following sections describe two ways to
achieve this goal.
If you already paid most of your interest upfront in points, paying
back the loan in a hurry may not benefit you a great deal. Cash is
still king! If paying the loan back early means you don’t have the
cash to pursue other deals, take your time.
Refinancing in a hurry
Conventional lenders tend to play it safe. As a result, they steer
clear of deals that they see as speculative. If you’re buying a run-
down property in the hopes of renovating it and selling it for a
profit, they’re likely to deem the project as too risky. To move for-
ward, you have to work through a hard-money lender or find
financing elsewhere.
After you renovate the property, however, or after it’s generating
some rental income, the risks are likely to be minimal. At this
point, conventional lenders are often more than willing to offer you
financing because you’re in a better position to make payments
and eventually pay back the loan.
Think of hard-money loans as short-term solutions. You pay a pre-
mium for gaining access to much-needed cash in a hurry. However,
after you’ve established the property as a profitable venture, you
don’t have to continue paying astronomical interest rates. By refi-
nancing through a conventional lender, you can often reduce your
monthly payment and interest and improve your cash flow. In addi-
tion, if you negotiated a refund for early payment with the hard-
money lender, you can reduce your loan expenses even more.
Due to seasoning restrictions that most lenders have, though, plan
on holding the property for a full 12 months before refinancing. (A
seasoned loan is more attractive to lenders, because it shows that
the borrower has made at least 12 payments on the loan and that
the original lender was able to make some money for its trouble.)
Conventional lenders may consider less time, but then you can
obtain financing only for the original sales price plus repairs, as
opposed to the actual new value, which should be greater.
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 181

Selling the property fast
Hard-money loans are often ideal for investors who flip properties
(buy-fix-sell within a year or so). With a hard-money loan, assuming
everything goes as planned, you can purchase a property, renovate
it, and sell it by the time you have to pay back the loan in full.
If you’re flipping properties, make sure you cover yourself by doing
the following:
 Calculate the finance charges (including points) into your
expenses and always make sure you’re on track to earn a
profit of 20 percent or more. This margin gives you a cushion
for unexpected expenses and cases in which the property 
sells for less than your target price. (Overestimate expenses
while underestimating the sales price for additional protection.)
 Have enough money on hand to cover the balloon payments
or cash calls. Many investors get into trouble when they have
to make a large payment while renovating the property and
trying to sell it. Plan ahead, so you don’t lose the property
before it starts to turn profitable.
 Give yourself enough time to sell the property. If the renova-
tions are probably going to take you three months and
another three months to sell it, make sure you have enough
funds to cover the holding costs for at least nine months —
perhaps even longer in a slumping market.
 Keep copies of all receipts, work orders, invoices and bids —
even for the smallest items. If a lender limits you to the origi-
nal purchase price plus repairs, you’re in a better position to
establish a higher value — and thus a higher loan amount.

182
Hard money isn’t always that hard
Hard-money lenders can be a real lifesaver when the right deal comes along. A few
years ago, I (Chip) was involved in a deal that required a facility to quickly be con-
verted in order to comply with international contract requirements. The owner would
receive several million dollars within 60 days, but only if the property was converted.
A hard-money lender answered the call with $7 million in just 21 days, allowing the
owner to realize a net profit of more than $13 million. The loan cost more than
$500,000 to put together, at an interest rate of 12 percent, but the cost was irrelevant
when my client was netting that kind of money!
Although this tale is true, the profits don’t represent a typical real estate investment
deal. Earning $7 million in three weeks on a single deal isn’t something that most
real estate investors, even the successful ones, ever experience.

Locating Local Hard-Money
Lenders
Walk down Main Street in any town or city and you can find at least a
few traditional lenders like banks or mortgage companies. What you
don’t see, however, is a hard-money lender. They’re not hiding in the
alleys and cellars — they just do business in less-conspicuous
places. You need to know where to look (and this section tells you
just that).
Asking your broker for leads
The most obvious and perhaps safest way to find hard-money
lenders is to ask your broker or loan officer. Many hard-money
lenders avoid the messiness of dealing directly with investors, so
they hire a loan officer or broker to manage the transactions. Your
broker may have several clients who are hard-money lenders.
Working through your broker adds another level of protection,
ensuring you that the hard-money lender is legitimate. If you find a
hard-money lender on your own, you need to rely solely on your
own judgment and that of any references you can dig up to deter-
mine whether the lender is trustworthy. When you work through
your broker, you have the benefit of an expert opinion on whether
the lender is reputable.
In addition to asking your broker for leads, consider networking
with local accountants, CPAs, financial planners, or estate attor-
neys. They often work with clients who are looking for good invest-
ment opportunities, and many people prefer to invest locally,
where they can keep an eye on things!
Networking through local 
investment groups
One of the best ways to track down any real estate professional,
including brokers and private lenders, is through a local real estate
investment group — organized individuals who meet regularly to
share information and advice about investing in real estate.
Networking in a local real estate investment group ensures that
you’re dealing with people who have a proven record and an estab-
lished reputation.
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 183

If you’re not a member of a local real estate investment group yet,
we strongly encourage you to find a group and start attending
meetings. To find a group in your area, try visiting the National
Real Estate Investors Association Web site at www.national
reia.com, click Find a REIA, and use the resulting map to track
down a local group.
Another way to find local groups is to ask your real estate agent,
broker, attorney, or other real estate professional. Most people
who work with real estate investors know which groups are the
most active and reputable.
Perusing ads in local newspapers
Hard-money lenders often place ads in the local newspapers letting
people know that they loan money. The ad may include something
like the following:
Stop Foreclosure!
Real Estate Loans
No Credit Required
Quick and Easy Financing
Call 1-800-555-5555
These ads may appear to be a little suspicious, but they’re the way
hard-money lenders often advertise their services.
Don’t hand over your personal information without performing
your own due diligence. Contact the lender and ask about the area
he lends in, the types of properties he specializes in, whether he’s
an individual or representing an investment group, and how many
transactions he’s done in the past year. Call the newspaper you
found the ad in and ask how long the person has been an adver-
tiser and whether the paper has received any complaints. Ask for
and check at least three references. Check search engines for the
lender’s name and company name. Check with the Better Business
Bureau and your state’s attorney general to determine whether
they have any complaints against the person on file.
Searching the Web
Many hard-money lenders advertise their services on the Web,
although they may not advertise as “hard-money lender.” Use your
favorite Internet search tool (Google, Yahoo!, MSN, whatever) to
search for the following:
Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
184

 Hard-money loan
 Equity lender
 Private lender or private investor
 Real estate investment group
Follow your search phrase with the name of your state, county, or
city to focus on local lenders who do hard-money loans. By dealing
locally, you have a better chance of finding someone who has a
track record of dealing with investors in your community.
Getting preapproval
Conventional wisdom has it that you should make friends before
you need them. In the same way, line up hard-money lenders
before you need them, so you can act quickly when the best oppor-
tunities come your way. The best way to do so is to obtain pre-
approval for a set amount of funds by going through the screening
process before you have a loan application on the table. (You
should already have a price range in mind for properties in the
market you want to target.)
Meet with and interview a few hard-money lenders before you
need a loan. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, some hard-
money lenders have loan officers who handle the transactions for
them. Proceed through the preapproval process as explained ear-
lier. Then, whether you need $50,000, $250,000, $1 million, or more,
you know exactly what types of renovation projects you can
pursue. As soon as you identify a prospective investment property
in an approved price range, you can then move on it quickly, know-
ing that you’re already approved for the money.
Hitting Up Friends and 
Relatives for a Loan
Charity should begin at home. (One thing we have in common is that
our grandmothers were our first and best investment partners.) If
you have a rich Uncle Jeb or Auntie Emily, or friends who have a
stash of cash they’re eager to invest (and you don’t mind calling in
some favors), hit them up for the money. With family members, you
may be able to get a short-term, no- or low-interest loan, assuming
you’re not the family pariah. Friends may charge a little more or a
little less, but if they have the dough and you know what you’re
doing, you can establish a mutually lucrative relationship.
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 185

In the following sections, we reveal the pros and cons of financing
investments through friends and relatives, offer advice on recog-
nizing opportunities, cover the basics of drawing up agreements,
and offer some words of wisdom to ensure that you don’t break
any securities laws when doing these deals.
Friends and family members are more likely than institutions (and
hard-money lenders) to become emotional about their money.
Grasping the pros and cons
Mixing business into relationships with family and friends can be a
risky proposition, particularly when your investments fall short of
expectations. Handled properly with the right people, however,
teaming up to invest in real estate can be one of the most reward-
ing activities you can ever hope to experience. Before immersing
yourself in the experience, be aware of the potential benefits and
pitfalls, as laid out in the following sections.
Potential benefits
Scoring investment capital through friends and family members
delivers a host of potential benefits, including the following:
 Access to cash you can’t get anywhere else
 More attractive interest rates and low or no closing costs
(usually)
 The joys of sharing a common goal and interest in your suc-
cess with those closest to you
 Flexibility in negotiating the terms of the loan
 Less pressure (sometimes) to pay the loan back precisely on
the agreed upon date
Potential pitfalls
Disagreements over finances trigger a lot of divorces, which says
something about mixing money and personal relationships. Before
borrowing money from friends or family, consider the common
challenges that often arise when you mix business with personal
relationships:
 Disagreements over when the loan is to be repaid
 Disagreements over the amount to be paid back (if you agreed
to pay interest)
Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
186

 Conflicts over how the investment is being managed — which
property to buy, how to renovate it, how to manage it (for a
rental property), or how to sell it (and for how much)
 Bad feelings for a long time if an investment goes bad and
you’re unable to repay the loan on time or at all
For these reasons, make sure you have a written agreement that
clearly spells out the terms of the loan (see the “Drawing up an
agreement” section later in this chapter).
Identifying the moneybags 
in your circle
One of the keys to avoiding the worst possible scenarios is to borrow
money only from those who can afford to lose it. If your kid brother
and your sister-in-law have a little nest egg set aside for a rainy day,
hitting them up for a loan may not be the best option. It may strain
their relationship in addition to leaving them strapped for cash if one
of them is laid off or they experience some other crisis.
Instead, scope out the rich relatives in your circle, the friends and
family members who are cash heavy and are often looking for ways
to invest their money that are often safer than Wall Street and prom-
ise a better return than they can get on CDs at their local bank. In
addition, given the recent craziness in both the housing market and
the stock market, family members may look more favorably on the
option of investing through a knowledgeable family member than
with someone or some company they don’t know.
Drawing up an agreement
When it comes to borrowing money from family members and
friends, most strife arises not out of differences of opinion but out
of misunderstandings. Perhaps you and your uncle discussed the
details, and you each walked away thinking you understood the
agreement, but when it comes time to execute, you discover that
you really didn’t hash out the details or that one of you has forgot-
ten a key clause you both agreed to.
For example, say you borrow money from your grandma with the
intent of just borrowing the money. Your idea is that your grandma
is putting up the money, but you’re in charge of everything else.
You head out, find a property you want to buy, and let grandma
know that it’s time for her to deliver the cash. You head over to
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 187

grandma’s, where you find her dressed to the nines and ready to
look at the property she’s buying.
The best way to avoid such uncomfortable scenarios is to draw up
a written agreement that covers the key details. Here are some
items your agreement should address:
 Amount of money (range) that your friend or relative is willing
and able to invest.
 Whether the cash can be used for the purchase of the prop-
erty, renovations, or both.
 The amount of time you have to pay back the loan.
 The amount of interest (if any) or the percentage of the profit
(if any) your friend or family member will be entitled to.
 Who’s in charge of making decisions on which property to
buy, the purchase price, which renovations to perform, how
much to pay for renovations, whether to rent or sell the prop-
erty, and so on. (You should try to retain as much control as
possible.)
 How you will proceed if the investment fails. How will the prop-
erty be liquidated, and how are you going to share the loss?
 How and how much information you plan on sharing. Are you
going to share all the financial figures with your investor(s)?
Will you provide them with written reports, and if so, how often?
 How you will resolve any disputes. Can you name an unbiased
intermediary?
Enlist the assistance of a qualified attorney in drawing up an agree-
ment that protects everyone’s interests. One form that such a
“contract” can take is a pro forma agreement. You can download a
boilerplate of such an agreement at www.themortgagemyths.com.
Keep in mind, however, that laws vary among states, so you’re best
served by consulting an attorney.
So, what do you do if you live in Florida, are going into business
with your grandma who lives in Arizona, and are buying property
in Georgia? In most cases, the court of jurisdiction is the state in
which the property is located, so make sure you have an attorney
licensed to practice in that state prepare the documents for you.

Honoring securities laws
When soliciting money from private investors, be careful not to
break any securities laws (rules and regulations that govern partial
ownership in a business venture). If you’re hitting up your
grandma or Uncle Fred for a loan, you should be in the clear, but if
you pass the hat among private investors, post an ad in the local
paper or on the Internet, or try to get a group of lenders to pool
their resources to finance your projects, you may have to be
licensed, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may
categorize these solicitations as a public offering — sort of like sell-
ing stock in a corporation rather than a simple loan transaction.
State regulators may also join the party, and it won’t be a fun one.
If you plan on soliciting funds from multiple individuals, strangers,
or the public at large, consult an attorney who’s familiar with secu-
rities regulations first to make sure you handle the transactions
properly.
Financing Fix-Ups with a Home
Equity Loan or Line of Credit
A hard-money loan can often cover the purchase price, but it may
not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairs and renovations. If
the property is valued at significantly more than what you paid for
it, however, you can often take out another loan to pay for repairs
and renovations — a home equity loan or home equity line of credit
(HELOC, or LOC for short).
In the following sections, we cover the basics of home equity loans
and lines of credit, encourage you to max out your LOC, and show
you how to apply for an LOC.
Although we cover both home equity loans and lines of credit, for
the purposes of financing repairs and renovations, an LOC is
almost always the preferred tool. With an LOC, you pay interest
only on the money you actually use. With a home equity loan, you
pay interest on the total amount you borrow whether you use the
money or have it sitting in a bank account.
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 189

Understanding home equity 
loans and LOCs
A home equity loan or line of credit unlocks the equity in your
home without affecting your current mortgage:
 A home equity loan provides you with a single chunk of money —
a one-time payment to you. Lenders may choose not to charge
closing costs on home equity loans. Some banks even pay for the
credit report and appraisal. (When credit is tight, as it was
during the writing of this book, lenders are likely to waive closing
costs only for borrowers with the absolute best credit scores.)
 A home equity line of credit enables you to borrow only what
you need and pay interest on only what you borrow, making
this option attractive for financing renovations. It’s sort of like
the line of credit you get with a credit card, but with a lower
interest rate (usually).
Home equity loans and lines of credit often come with adjustable
interest rates, which carry additional risks, as we explain in
Chapter 5. The good news is the interest on home equity loans and
lines of credit qualifies as mortgage interest, so it’s tax deductible.
Maxing out your LOC
When applying for an LOC, don’t be shy about asking for the maxi-
mum amount you can borrow against the property. You pay inter-
est only on the amount you use, so you’re not penalized for maxing
out your LOC.
However, just because you have $50,000 available for repairs and ren-
ovations doesn’t mean you should use every penny of it. Stick to
your budget so you have a better chance of hitting your profit target.
Keep in mind that your ability to “max out” your LOC can change
depending on what’s going on in the marketplace. When housing
values are soaring, lenders are often willing to let you cash out
every penny of equity in a property. Some lenders even allow you
to borrow equity in excess of what the property has in it. However,
when property values take a dive, lenders are often stung by these
loose lending practices and may significantly restrict the amount
of equity you can cash out.

190

Applying for an LOC
Applying for an LOC is very similar to the application process for a
conventional loan, as explained in Chapter 7. You need to fill out a
loan application and supply the loan officer with supporting docu-
mentation, including copies of your most recent federal income tax
returns, 30 days’ worth of pay stubs, and a list of assets and liabilities.
In addition, the lender typically requires an appraisal to ensure
that the estimated equity in the property is accurate. With a home
equity line of credit, the home’s equity (market value minus what
you currently owe on the property) serves as the collateral to
secure the loan.
Supplementing Your Financing
with Credit Cards
Many families are over their heads in high-interest credit card
debt, so it may seem a little strange that we would even consider
suggesting the possibility of using a credit card account to finance
real estate investments. Who in their right mind would want to pay
18 percent or more in credit card interest when they could get an
LOC for less than 10 percent?
We’re not suggesting that you max out your credit cards to pur-
chase property, but credit cards can give you quick access to cash
for repairs, renovations, and unexpected expenses.
This section looks at advantages to using your credit cards, helps
you decide which cards to use, and explains the importance of
staying current with your payments.
Eyeing the pros to credit card use
Using a credit card to supplement your financing is an easy way to
get your hands on cash fast. Consider some of the advantages that
credit card financing offers:
 Most credit cards enable you to take cash advances, no ques-
tions asked. (Some companies send you checks to make it
even easier.)
 You can usually get hold of some cash within 24 hours.
Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 191

 Credit card debt is unsecured. In other words, you put up no
collateral to secure the credit, so the credit card company
can’t seize your property in lieu of payment if you happen to
default on the “loan.”
 The credit card company doesn’t charge closing costs. You
probably have to pay a substantial amount in transaction fees
and interest, but if you use the money short-term, it can be
less than you’d pay a hard-money lender. Do the math.
Keep the credit card option off the table until you really need it in a
pinch. If you play the card too early, you may not have the option
when you really need it. In addition, keeping your personal
finances separate from your business (investing) finances can sig-
nificantly reduce your exposure to risk. We advise using a credit
card only as a last resort.
Choosing a credit card with low
interest and plenty of perks
Credit cards aren’t all created equal. Some companies charge lower
interest, others offer perks — frequent flyer miles, free groceries or
merchandise, cash back on purchases, and so on. Shop around for
credit cards that have the lowest interest rates and the most perks.
Be sure to read the fine print so you’re not just comparing introduc-
tory rates. The fine print tells you what the rate jumps to after the
introductory period expires.
You can comparison-shop for credit cards online at www.credit
cardguide.com. If you have some major renovations lined up, con-
sider applying for a credit card at your building supply store. Many
of these stores offer a discount on your entire purchase the first
time you apply for and use the card. If you order $5,000 in materi-
als and receive a 10 percent discount, that’s $500 you save in reno-
vation expenses.
Check your monthly statement to determine your credit limit and
stay within that limit. Also, pay off the balance as soon as possible.
We know people who charge everything on their credit card —
their phone bill, electric bill, groceries, gas, auto maintenance, cloth-
ing, cable bill, and so on — and then pay the balance as soon as the
bill arrives. They collect the perks (often something like 1 to 2 per-
cent cash back on merchandise) without paying a penny in interest!

Chapter 12
Capitalizing on Seller
Financing
In This Chapter
 Securing seller financing through a land contract
 Leasing a property with the option to buy
 Protecting your investment from the forfeiture clause
W
hen most people think about purchasing a home they can’t
afford to pay cash for, the only option they consider is bor-
rowing the money from a bank. They automatically assume that
the seller wants cash at the closing table.
Highly motivated sellers, however, may be willing and perhaps
even eager to sell you the home on contract and finance the pur-
chase themselves. Doing so enables them to profit in two ways:
 By selling you the property for a profit
 By collecting interest as a part of the financing agreement
Financing the purchase is a pretty secure investment for the seller.
It allows them to place their cash in an investment vehicle that
they are very familiar with — as opposed to investing it with those
friendly folks on Wall Street.
In this chapter, we reveal two ways you can purchase a property
on contract with seller financing: by using a land contract (or con-
tract for deed) or a lease option (rent-to-own) agreement.
Buying Property on Contract 
with a Land Contract
With a land contract (also called a contract for deed or installment
sales contract), you buy the property directly from the owner/seller,

just as you always do, but you also finance the purchase through
the seller. The seller becomes the bank, but instead of using a mort-
gage to secure the loan, you sign a land contract stipulating the
terms of the transaction.
The legal language in a land contract is very similar to what you
find in a mortgage, but you don’t actually take title to the property.
You instead have what is called equitable interest, which basically
means that you own the property as long as you honor your part
of the contract (including making payments on time). The land
contract stipulates the interest rate, contract length, and the amor-
tization method. (Refer to Chapter 6 for more on amortization.) For
you, as the buyer/investor, the arrangement differs very little from
what you may expect working through a bank. The seller is forgo-
ing a lump sum payment in exchange for regular income and may
qualify for some tax advantages as a result.
In the following sections, we unveil the potential benefits and
drawbacks of buying properties on contract, show you how to pro-
tect yourself by inspecting the title first and avoiding the due-on-
sale-clause trap, and walk you through the process of buying a
property on contract.
The ups and downs of buying 
a property on contract
Purchasing a property and financing the purchase through the
seller appeals to the entrepreneur in everyone. It cuts out the mid-
dleman (the bank) and cuts to the chase, reducing fees and has-
sles. It’s a model of free-market, freewheeling economy at work.
Buying on contract, however, is also riddled with risks. In the fol-
lowing sections, we explore the pros and cons of this path so you
can make a well-informed decision as to whether buying on con-
tract is right for you.
The pros of using a land contract
Purchasing properties through a land contract rather than financ-
ing the purchase through a bank offers several advantages for
investors, including the following:
 The seller may provide financing when a bank won’t.
 You save on closing costs.
 The seller may offer lower monthly payments than a bank
would charge you.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
194

 The seller may also agree to a low- or no-down-payment deal,
assuming you have outstanding credit.
 You may not have to jump through so many hoops to prove
that you’re creditworthy.
 The seller may be more flexible if you’re late with a payment
or two (but don’t count on it).
The cons of using a land contract
Purchasing a property on contract seems to be the ideal scenario.
You purchase and finance the purchase through a single entity (the
seller) and avoid all the red tape and hassles that large institutions
use to trip you up. However, the land contract does come with its
share of potential drawbacks, including the following:
 You don’t have a bank covering your back. By having an 
attorney and title company in your corner, however, you 
can gain the protection you need.
 The seller may require a larger down payment or charge
higher interest.
 Most contracts have a forfeiture clause stating that you give up
your rights to the property if you fail to honor the contract. See
“Beware of the Forfeiture Clause” later in this chapter for details.
 You increase your chances of becoming a victim of fraud. If, for
example, you fail to record the land contract at the register of
deeds, the seller (listed as the official owner) can borrow
against the property and try to stick you with the debt.
 When the time comes to refinance or sell, you and the seller
may have disagreements over the balance.
 If the sellers fail to pay their obligations or end up in bank-
ruptcy court, you may end up having to defend your interests
in court.
Inspecting the title
Before you even consider financing the purchase through the
seller, do your homework to make sure the owner/seller is the
rightful (and sole) owner of the property and has no undisclosed
liens against the property. In order to do your preliminary title
research, you can head down to your county’s register of deeds
office and ask the clerk for whatever info is recorded on a particu-
lar property’s title. At the bare minimum, obtain a copy of the deed
and any other recorded documents for the current and previous
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 195

owner. If possible, obtain copies of all documents recorded in the
past 24 months.
Inspect the title work and deed for the following crucial pieces of data:
 Mortgagor (homeowners’) names: Note whether the mort-
gagor’s name matches the name actually listed as the prop-
erty’s title holder. Differing names raise a red flag — make a
note of any discrepancy.
 Price and previous price paid for the property: This info can
help you estimate the property’s current value.
 Warranty deed names: The names on the deed should match
the homeowners’ names on the title. If they don’t match, the
difference raises a red flag; make note of it.
 Previous mortgagor: Check the previous title and jot down
the names on the title. Note any chinks in the chain of title
(series of owners). For instance, say your title work shows
that Johnson sold the property to Davis and then Howard sold
it to Pinkerton. But whom did Davis sell the house to, and
whom did Howard buy it from? This gap indicates a problem
in the chain of title; consult your title company whenever you
notice any irregularities in this chain.
 Mortgages or liens: Make sure the owner/seller owns the
property outright. If you see any liens against the property,
you want to make sure the seller pays off the lien holders
before you sign the contract.
 Property tax liens: Check with the county tax assessor’s
office for recent tax bills that are due and owing, or even pre-
vious years’ taxes that haven’t been paid, which may have
been transferred to the state. Any tax liens trump your rights!
If you notice any discrepancies in the chain of title or any other red
flags, ask the register of deeds about it, consult your title company,
and bring up the issue with the current owner. If the answers don’t
satisfy you, don’t do the deal.
Although you can do this research yourself (and you really should
do it yourself to learn about title research), we recommend that as
a beginner you consult your title company for a second opinion and
order a title commitment (a preliminary report). After you feel com-
fortable doing your own research, you can take on more of the
burden.

196

Beware of the due on sale clause
If you have documented proof that the owner/seller owns the prop-
erty free and clear, you can skip this section. If the seller has a
mortgage, however, that mortgage almost certainly has a due on
sale clause that may cause significant trouble if you move forward
with the deal. A due on sale clause states that if the owners sell or
transfer equitable ownership in the property, they must immedi-
ately pay off the remaining balance on the loan in full.
Here’s how that little clause can affect you: Say the seller has a mort-
gage on the property and sells it to you. As soon as you complete
the transaction, you head down to the register of deeds office to
record the contract; this act protects your rights to the property by
recording your name as the new owner. However, the fact that the
property has changed hands is now public knowledge, and if the
bank finds out, it can call in the loan. Now the seller has to come up
with the money to pay the total balance remaining on that loan,
which means he’ll probably try to squeeze the money out of you.
Of course, you may be able to get away with not recording the 
contract, but this clever ruse can expose you to even greater risk:
 If the lender finds out, it can pursue legal action against you
for conspiring to commit fraud. And the lender always finds
out through the change in the insurance coverage.
 If you’re dealing with an unscrupulous seller, the seller can
load up the property with other liens and mortgages.
Remember, until you record the contract, the seller is still the
official property owner and can borrow against it.
Almost every nongovernmental mortgage contains a due on sale
clause. No matter how much you want a certain property, don’t ever
consider trying to sneak a seller-financed deal through without noti-
fying the bank. Otherwise, you put yourself in great financial peril.
The how-to: What you need to do
Buying a property on contract doesn’t require any more effort or
expertise on your part than financing through a bank. It does, how-
ever, require that you have the wisdom to have a qualified real
estate attorney examine the contract before you sign it. If the seller
wasn’t originally planning to sell the property on contract, you
may even be able to have your attorney prepare the paperwork.
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 197

If you’re looking for a step-by-step guide on how to buy a property
on contract, here’s a general breakdown of the steps:
1. Find a property that interests you.
If you use a real estate agent to help you identify poten-
tially lucrative investment opportunities, try to choose an
agent who understands these creative financing deals and
can explain how they work to prospective sellers.
If the property has been on the market for several months,
the seller may be more motivated than usual to finance the
purchase. Don’t just look for listings that advertise seller
financing — find the property first and then pitch your
offer to the seller.
2. Research the property carefully to be fairly certain that
you’re investing in a profitable property.
Check out Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition,
by Eric Tyson and Robert S. Griswold (Wiley) for informa-
tion on researching your market and specific properties.
3. Pitch a reasonable offer.
Because you’re going to be asking the seller to finance the
deal, don’t try to lowball the seller too much on the purchase
price (but make sure you’re not overpaying and can still earn
the desired profit). Explain that although you can afford to
make the payments, you don’t meet the bank’s stringent
requirements and need seller financing to do the deal.
4. Ask your agent or attorney to write up your offer.
Make sure the offer specifies your down payment, the inter-
est rate you’re willing to pay, and the monthly payments
and any other lump-sum payments you make over the life
of the loan. Here are some additional tips:
• Offer a low down payment to maximize your cash flow.
• Offer a higher interest rate than the seller is likely to
get by keeping the money in a savings account or CD.
• Specify the date on which you agree to pay the loan
back in full — typically in three to five years. (You
should have plans to sell the property or refinance
with a conventional loan by then.)
5. Hire a title company or real estate agent to manage the
closing to ensure that all the i’s are dotted and the t’s are
crossed and that all the paperwork is properly recorded
with the register of deeds.

198

Before you sign the contract, obtain a formal title insurance
policy. This protects you just in case someone shows up
later claiming rights to the property. Never buy a property
without buying title insurance for it.
Protecting yourself against fraud
By carefully researching the properties that interest you (particu-
larly the legal documents associated with them), you protect your-
self not only from inadvertent errors but also from con artists who
are trying to fleece you. Con artists often file false or doctored docu-
ments as part of their scams. Sometimes, they can even sell a house
they don’t own or sell a house several times to different buyers.
To protect yourself from falling victim to a real estate scam, take
the following precautions:
 Check the records to see whether the mortgage on the prop-
erty was recently paid off. Sellers rarely pay off mortgages
right before they sell, so any document that shows the mort-
gage as having been recently paid off should make you more
cautious.
 Be wary of an investor pitching you an unbelievably great
deal on a property. Con artists often target novice investors
in double-sales scams and often offer incredibly great deals so
they can find buyers in a hurry.
 Analyze the title commitment for suspicious transactions. If
the title shows that the property’s been sold several times
over a short period, for example, the property may be
involved in an illegal flipping scheme. Make sure the title com-
mitment covers the past 24-month history of the property,
including mortgages.
 Purchase title insurance as soon as possible and pay for it
upfront. Sometimes, title insurance is your only protection
against fraudulent activity that’s impossible to detect prior to
purchasing a property.
Renting to Own with a Lease
Option Agreement
A lease option agreement is essentially a rent-to-own deal. You agree
to pay rent for a fixed period, after which you have the option (but
aren’t required) to buy the property. Normally the sellers charge 
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 199

5 to 10 percent upfront and treat it as a down payment, deducting it
from the purchase price. You pay monthly rent of about 1 percent
of the purchase price.
For example, if you have a lease option agreement on a $200,000
house, you can expect to pay $10,000 to $20,000 down and $2,000
per month. A portion of the monthly payment usually goes toward
the principal. At the end of the lease term, if you choose to pur-
chase the property, you pay the remaining balance due on the pur-
chase price you agreed to pay.
A lease option agreement can be a great financing solution, assum-
ing you’re working with trustworthy seller and you can secure the
funds needed to purchase the property by the time your option to
buy rolls around. If you don’t have the money ready when the time
comes to exercise your option, you may forfeit the deal and end up
losing your down payment and any interest you paid in monthly
payments (depending on how the agreement is worded).
As suggested by its name, the lease option agreement consists of
two parts:
 The lease part: In the lease part, the seller and the buyer (you)
have a landlord-tenant relationship. The seller agrees to let
you live in the property for a certain period as long as you pay
the rent and don’t trash the joint.
 The option part: The option part covers the terms of the sale.
In the following sections, we highlight the important areas of each
part to steer you clear of the most common pitfalls.
You may be wondering whether you should proceed with repairs
and renovations prior to exercising your option to purchase. If
you’re certain that you’re going to exercise your option, feel free to
begin working on the property. The seller will like to see you improv-
ing the property, because it demonstrates your commitment to the
deal. However, contracts usually require the seller to preapprove all
repairs, additions, and renovations. If you’re not sure you’re going to
exercise your option, you may want to avoid moving forward with
any extensive renovations — recovering your investment later can
become problematic or even impossible.

Grasping the fundamentals of 
a lease option agreement
A lease option agreement is a legal document. As a result, it’s usu-
ally packed with legal language that you need an attorney to 
decipher. As an investor, however, you should understand the key
points of the agreement:
 You have the option to buy, but you don’t have to do so. If
you have a lease option to buy a $200,000 home and its
market value drops to $150,000 when you have the option to
buy, you would probably be wise not to exercise your option
(or at least renegotiate the price).
 In addition to a down payment, the seller usually requires
you to pay a fee for the option to buy. This fee is usually non-
refundable.
 Although you can agree at signing to pay market value
when your option to buy rolls around, you usually want to
lock in a price from the get-go. You especially want to lock
the price if you expect property values to rise, so when you
exercise your option, you’re paying a lower than current
market price.
 In most cases, you lease the property for one to three years
for a set rental amount. The part of your monthly rent above
the market rate is usually applied toward the purchase price,
essentially paying down the principal.
 During the lease period, the seller can’t sell the property to
anyone else. As a result, you tie up the property, so nobody
else has a chance to buy it.
 In most cases, you need the seller’s approval to assign the
lease option to someone else. In other words, you can’t just
lease the property to anyone of your choosing. The seller has
a say in your selection of tenants.
 If you don’t exercise your option to buy, it expires. At that
point, the seller can sell the property to someone else, and
you lose any deposit and additional rent credits you’ve paid.
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 201

Using the lease to earn some cash
The lease portion of the agreement stipulates the rental agreement
between you and the seller. It typically covers the length of the
lease, your monthly payment, the portion of the payment that goes
toward the purchase price, the condition in which you must main-
tain the property, whether or not you can have pets, and whether
you can sublease the property to other tenants. You may be able to
use the lease agreement to your advantage if you’re looking to
make some extra cash.
Read the lease carefully to ensure that you can honor what it stipu-
lates and that it contains no language that the seller can easily use
to prove that you broke the contract. In the following sections, we
point out the two key areas to focus on.
Ensuring you can sublease the property
Most people who buy homes by using lease option agreements are
people who use those homes as their primary residences. During
the lease period, they live in the home. As an investor, however,
you probably already have a place you call home, so living in the
property isn’t really a choice. Leaving the property vacant really
isn’t a choice either, so you probably want to sublet the property
until you eventually take ownership of it.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
202
Lease options: Win-win deals
A lease option deal can be a win-win situation for both the buyer and the seller. The
buyer can lock in the purchase price of a home in an area where home values are
on the rise. For example, if you have a lease option to buy a $250,000 property over
the course of 24 months, and the home increases in value by 10 percent over that
two-year period, you have $25,000 of equity built up in the house that can help you
obtain a conventional loan to purchase the property or that you can use as a down
payment on the property when your option to buy the house arrives.
The seller benefits by getting tenants (potentially buyers) who treat the house with
tender loving care because they’re planning on eventually owning it.
The seller has less property maintenance to perform, usually collects a nonrefund-
able option fee upfront (with a deferred tax, meaning taxes won’t be due on the
option fee until the sale is finalized), has a steady cash flow from the monthly rent,
and has a buyer lined up to purchase the property when the lease option term
expires. In addition, instead of paying short-term capital gains on profits from the
sale of the property, the seller can hold the property in excess of a year, so the prof-
its qualify for the much lower long-term capital gains tax rate.

When examining the agreement, make sure it includes a clause
stating that you have the right to sublet the property. Otherwise,
you may get stuck paying holding costs for a property that’s not
generating any revenue for you, which is never a good situation.
When you find someone interested in renting the property, make
sure the agreement you settle on with the renters fits your invest-
ment strategy. If you want to sublet the property for two years, pay
the balance due on the purchase price, and sell the property, be
sure the rental agreement clearly spells out when the lease ends.
You also need to ensure that the other terms of your lease are
incorporated into the sublease, or you risk violating the lease
option agreement.
Assigning the lease to another party
Another way you can profit from the property is by selling your
interest in the contract. A lease option agreement contains value
that may be of interest to another party if you later decide not to
exercise your option. Your lease option agreement should give you
the right to assign the lease to another party, essentially allowing
them to step into your position and exercise the option later.
I (Chip) once located a $300,000 property that had been on the
market for quite some time. I negotiated a $3,000 lease option and
then subleased it as an investment property. I negotiated a two-
month delay on the initial payment and used the security deposit
and first month’s rent to pay for the option. I made a couple of
quick fixes on the property, created a nice cash flow, and ended up
selling my interest in the lease option to another investor for
$7,000. So after putting in about five hours on the deal and some
cosmetic touch-ups, I made a $4,000 profit in two months without
taking title to the property, and using none of my own money.
Dealing with the option
The more interesting part of the lease option agreement is the
option to buy — your prerogative, at the end of the lease period, to
purchase the property . . . or not. When the time finally arrives,
you should actually have three options:
 Exercise your option. In other words, buy the property for the
agreed-upon price.
 Choose not to exercise your option, in which case the
prospective seller keeps the property, whatever you paid for
the option, whatever lease payments you made, and perhaps
even the down payment and interest.
 Sell your option to another party.
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 203

You may actually have one more alternative — you may be able to
choose not to exercise your option and then negotiate the pur-
chase for a lower price, assuming property values have dropped or
you believe that the sellers need to sell in a hurry.
In the following sections, we discuss your option options in greater
detail.
Exercising your option
Assuming you signed a lease option agreement with the intention
of ultimately purchasing the property and that housing values
haven’t dropped since you agreed to the deal, you probably want
to exercise your option before it expires.
Your lease option agreement should lay out exactly what you need
to do to exercise your option to buy the property. Here’s a sample
of how the option clause is likely to appear:
To exercise the option to purchase, the buyer/tenant must
deliver to the seller/landlord written notice of the intent to pur-
chase. The notice must specify a valid closing date preceding
the expiration date of the lease agreement or the date of the
expiration of the option to purchase, whichever occurs later.
Follow the instructions to the letter. If the agreement says that you
need to deliver your written notice dressed as Little Bo Peep,
deliver the notice dressed accordingly. Any discrepancy can cause
you to forfeit your option to purchase and result in the loss of the
property and any money you’ve sunk into it.
Not exercising your option
You may choose not to exercise your option for any of several 
reasons — a downturn in the market that makes the property
worth much less than you agreed to pay for it, financial woes that
make you unable to afford the property, an inability to obtain the
financing you need by the option deadline, and so on.
Not exercising your option is easy — you do nothing other than
move out or make sure any tenants you subleased to vacate the
property. You also need to make sure the property is in the condi-
tion you agreed to leave it in. Other than that, you simply walk away.
As a courtesy to the seller/landlord, provide sufficient notice that
you plan on not exercising your option. Thirty days or more is best.

204

Selling your option
As long as the agreement doesn’t contain an exclusivity clause (as
discussed in the following text), you can assign the option to buy
the property to another party — essentially selling your interest 
in the property.
A simple assignment agreement is all that’s necessary, with a simul-
taneous notification of assignment letter to the seller. Your attorney
can supply you with the agreement and letter of notification.
Typically, the lease option contract contains a notification clause
that requires you to let the seller know your intentions at least 90
days before the option expires. No matter what you decide, you
send the seller a certified letter (return receipt requested) to 
protect your rights.
If you decide to assign your option to buy, consult your attorney to
prepare the necessary documents. 
When you purchase an option to buy a property, avoid signing a
lease option agreement that contains an exclusivity clause like the
following (unless you’re absolutely certain that you’re not going to
want to sell your option):
The option to purchase is exclusive and nonassignable and exists
solely for the benefit of the named parties above. If the buyer/
tenant attempts to assign, convey, delegate, or transfer this
option to purchase without the seller/landlord’s express written
permission, any such attempt shall be deemed null and void.
The sellers/landlords are likely to want this language in the con-
tract to protect themselves in the event that you try to sell the
option to someone who’s less likely to secure financing to execute
the option. Your choice to sell the option, however, doesn’t really
affect the position of the sellers/landlords — it’s just another way
you’ve chosen to exercise your option.
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 205

Paying Close Attention to 
the Forfeiture Clause
Lease option agreements all contain a forfeiture or default clause
stating exactly what happens in the event that the buyer/tenant
chooses not to exercise the option or fails to comply with other
terms stated in the agreement. The clause usually appears some-
thing like the following:
If buyer/tenant defaults under this agreement, then seller/
landlord may terminate the option to purchase through written
notice of the termination. If the agreement is terminated, the
buyer/tenant shall lose entitlement to any refund of rent or
option payment.
The forfeiture clause itself is necessary and fairly innocuous. After
all, if you break the contract, you should pay some sort of penalty.
What’s potentially dangerous is everything else in the contract, so
be sure to read the agreement thoroughly to make sure that you
won’t have any trouble complying.
Some con artists have used the lease option agreement as a way to
scam home buyers and investors out of money. They word the
agreement in a way that makes it nearly impossible for the buyer
to honor it. Their goal is to collect as much money upfront and
through monthly payments as possible and then repossess the
property on the grounds that the buyer broke the contract.
To protect yourself, make payments through an insured third-party
servicing company (commonly called an escrow company). Doing
so makes the accounting fair and complete for both parties and
helps avoid disputes when the time comes to pay off the contract
or exercise the option. Many banks also provide this service.
Make sure that you make all payments by check or electronic
funds transfer to avoid any question about the dates or amounts of
payments, and make sure that the insurance policy names you as
an “insured party” to protect your interests in case of loss.

Risk and the Equity
In This Chapter
 Distinguishing between partnerships and joint ventures
 Deciding whether to take on a partner
 Teaming up with the right person
 Drafting a partnership agreement
 Steering clear of common partnership woes
T
o succeed as an investor, you need time, know-how, and cash
or credit. If you have the time and the know-how, you can often
find someone who has the cash or the credit to finance the deal
and perhaps even share responsibilities and workload. Partnerships
and joint ventures enable you to do just that — enlist the assistance
of others to obtain financing and share costs, workload, and profits.
In this chapter, we explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of
partnerships and joint ventures and then show you how to struc-
ture such deals in a way that is mutually beneficial for you and
your partner.
Talent trumps money. As an investor with the skills to transform
money into more money, you’re at least as valuable as the person
putting up the money. Don’t sell yourself short — financiers need
your talents at least as much as you need their money.
Differentiating between a
Partnership and a Joint Venture
In your search for cash and credit, you may turn to a partnership
or joint venture arrangement. These two options offer you great
opportunities for raising some quick cash and credit. Before we dig

deeper into the nitty-gritty of these two arrangements in this chap-
ter, you first need to make sure you can recognize the difference
between a bona fide partnership and a joint venture:
 A partnership is an agreement between two or more individu-
als to pool their skills, knowledge, experience, and resources
for a common undertaking and share potential profits and
losses on any and all activities they choose to engage in. For
tax purposes, profits pass through the partnership to the indi-
viduals, but the partnership still has to submit a tax return.
Partnerships are primarily useful for business ventures that
involve the joint holding of assets that appreciate, such as
real estate or businesses. If you want to remain the sole owner
of your assets, a formal partnership isn’t for you. Explore
other sources for financing, such as hard money lenders, as
discussed in Chapter 11.
 A joint venture is an agreement between two or more individu-
als to team up on a single enterprise, such as a particular real
estate investment. With a joint venture, the IRS doesn’t
require that the venture file a separate tax return.
Although partnerships and joint ventures differ in legal terms and
complexity, in this chapter, we treat them both under the umbrella
of partnerships, because they both involve two or more parties
working together on investment properties.
Whether you’re involved in a partnership or a joint venture, you
share liability with your partners. To provide you and your part-
ners some protection against potential lawsuits, consider forming
a limited liability company (LLC), as discussed in Chapter 2, and
processing all transactions through the LLC.
Weighing the Pros and 
Cons of Partnerships
Partnerships, like marriages, can be good or bad, productive or
destructive. A great partnership can enable you to do more and
profit more than you and your partner ever could on your own. A
lousy partnership, on the other hand, can drain your resources,
derail your plans, and shatter whatever personal relationship you
may have had with your partner.
Before you jump at the prospect of teaming up with your best
friend or in-law, consider some of the pros and cons to partner-
ships addressed in the following sections.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
208

Investigating potential benefits
Partnerships offer several advantages for real estate investors,
including the following:
 Additional resources: These resources come in the form of
time, money, and skills.
 Increased networking opportunities: Your partner can intro-
duce you to additional business and personal contacts.
 Shared workload and responsibilities: Your partner can
pitch in to take on some of the chores, so the two of you have
more time and energy to invest in other projects. In addition,
your partner may have skills and experience to take on tasks
you’re unqualified to perform.
 Shared risk: If you and your partner are sharing the profits,
you should also be divvying up the risk, so you stand to lose
less if a property fails to turn a profit.
 Diverse insight and input on business decisions: Your part-
ner may have a unique perspective and even better insight
into potentially profitable investment properties, suppliers, or
past experiences.
 Increased accountability: Having to answer to a partner often
motivates individuals to fulfill their responsibilities, follow
through on promises, and avoid making impulse decisions
Considering potential drawbacks
Given the fact that partnerships often fail, they obviously have
some potential drawbacks, including the following:
 Trust issues: Partners have been known to run off with the
cash, so choose a trustworthy partner and keep an eye on the
money. (You and your partners should all review the financial
records on a regular basis.)
 Disagreements about who’s doing more: One of the most
common disagreements that arises in partnerships centers on
who’s doing more for or giving more to the partnership. If you’re
doing all the work and start to feel that your partner is just a
bean counter, you’re likely to feel some underlying resentment
that will eventually find some way of expressing itself.
 Asset sharing: As partners, you may share ownership in prop-
erties. If you or your partner wants to liquidate a particular
asset and the other person doesn’t, conflicts can arise.
Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 209

 Power sharing: If you need to call all the shots, you may have
trouble with a partner who wants to share in the decision-
making process.
 Legal responsibilities: Inside a partnership, if one of the part-
ners makes a mistake, other partners may be held legally liable.
Asking yourself whether you really need a partner
You’ve reviewed the pros and cons of having a partner, and you’re
still not sure whether forming a partnership is the right move for
you. Do you really need a partner? Here are some general guide-
lines to help you decide:
 If you’re partnering just to get your mitts on some cash, you
probably don’t need a partner. As long as you found a great
investment opportunity, you can probably find the financing
elsewhere and keep all the profits to yourself. With a partner-
ship, you’d probably end up paying more in profit sharing
than you’d pay in interest, even if you used hard money.
 If you’re partnering just to limit your exposure to risk, you’re
thinking about the investment all wrong. If you’re already that
worried about the risk, maybe you’re looking at a property
you shouldn’t buy.
 If you’re partnering because the investor has more knowledge
or experience or skills than you do, you’re probably making the
right move. You share a cut of the profits but are likely to make
wiser investment decisions and earn an education in the process.
Partnerships also make sense if you’re partnering to share the
workload. One partner may have more time and flexibility than the
other to take phone calls, search for investment properties, and
deal with contractors. Just make sure your partner has the skills as
well as the time to perform these tasks.
Finding a Partner with 
the Right Stuff
A partnership requires outstanding communication skills to survive
and thrive, so partnerships often crumble when partners disagree
about the division of work and money.
Choose your partner as carefully (or perhaps even more carefully)
as you would choose a spouse or significant other, and work together
to communicate your visions, dreams, ideas, and any problems you
may have that may negatively affect your partnership. Being open,
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
210

honest, and understanding can keep your partnership on an 
even keel.
In the following sections, we show you how to search for partners
with the right stuff, screen candidates, and make sure you both
have something to gain from the relationship.
Scoping out prospective partners
Because this is a book on financing real estate investments, we
assume that you have the knowledge and skills to make solid invest-
ment decisions. As such, you’re in the market for the right partner
who can deliver the financing, and you need to know where you can
find people who fit the bill. Here’s a list of places to start:
 Family and friends: People you already know are generally a
little more trustworthy than complete strangers. The only
drawback is that if the partnership suffers, your relationship
with the person is also likely to take a hit, which is a very
important consideration.
 Business owners or associates: Doctors, dentists, attorneys,
and other professionals may have money that they’d prefer
investing in real estate rather than the stock market, if they
only knew how to go about it. In addition, these professionals
rarely have the time to invest in real estate. Consider teaming
up with someone you already do business with.
 Mortgage brokers: Your mortgage broker may be willing to
partner with you, and even if she isn’t, she probably knows
others in the market who are eager to partner with a real
estate investor. Ask your broker to put you in touch with
others who may be interested in forming a partnership.
 Real estate agents: Real estate agents sell homes, but many
also invest in real estate. After all, nobody knows the market
like a qualified agent. An agent may not have the time to shop
for real estate, put together deals, oversee repairs and renova-
tions, and manage properties, so the right candidate may be
willing to partner with someone who does.
 Real estate attorneys: In addition to knowing the market and
having plenty of connections, a good real estate attorney may
have money to invest in real estate. Consider asking your real
estate attorney whether he’d be interested in becoming your
partner.
Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 211

 Accountants: By their very nature, accountants work with
business owners and individuals who are looking for invest-
ments and tax deductions. Approach your accountant and ask
whether she has any clients looking for income opportunities.
 Real estate investment groups: Join a local real estate invest-
ment group and network to identify potential candidates for
partnerships. To find a group in your area, try visiting the
National Real Estate Investors Association Web site at
www.nationalreia.com, click “Find a REIA”, and use the
resulting map to track down a local group.
Be careful when shopping for partners through real estate
investment groups. Con artists often join groups to find 
eager investors to scam. Remember, if a deal seems too 
good to be true, it probably is. Make sure the person has a
long history and a strong reputation in the community.
Checking a prospective 
partner’s qualifications
When you partner with someone, you’re essentially hiring one
another to do a job or provide some sort of service, such as financ-
ing. You wouldn’t hire employees before checking whether they are
who they say they are or can deliver what they promise, so don’t
partner with someone until you’ve checked the following:
 Personal identification: If you don’t know the individual per-
sonally, make sure you have the person’s name, address, and
phone number. Verify that the address exists (and the person
lives there) and that the phone number is accurate. Ask for a
copy of his driver’s license, and offer him a copy of yours.
 References: Ask the person for three personal and three busi-
ness references, and then check those references.
 Background: You can order a background check on the Internet
on sites such as www.ZabaSearch.com. Even if you think you
know the person well, order a background check to make sure
the person isn’t on the FBI’s Most Wanted List. Do a quick public
records search at the same time to check for lawsuits.
 Credit report: Before entering into a partnership agreement,
ask your future partner to provide you with a copy of her
credit report. The last thing you need is to be supporting a
deadbeat or someone who’s on the verge of bankruptcy.

212

Making sure your partner has what
you need and needs what you have
Investing in real estate with your favorite cousin may seem like a
whole lot of fun, but you have to ask yourself whether it’s a wise
business decision. Sure, you two get along swell and you’re so
close that trust really isn’t an issue, but do you have complemen-
tary skills and resources?
One of the most common mistakes people make when choosing a
partner is to choose someone who’s just like them. You definitely
want someone you can get along with, but you also want someone
with a different set of skills and resources. If you’re both great at
fixing up properties but neither of you is very good with crunching
numbers, you may run into problems.
In the following sections, we describe the skills and resources indi-
viduals often swap when forming productive real estate investment
partnerships.
Trading experience for cash or credit
Experienced real estate investment professionals often trade their
skills, knowledge, and experience for cash or credit. This exchange
is essentially what you’re doing whenever you take out a loan to
finance the purchase of an investment property. You exchange
your skills and experience in exchange for the cash you need to
purchase a property and profit from it, so the relationship between
you and the lender is mutually beneficial.
Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 213
Tripping into a partnership
Almost by accident, my (Chip’s) first foreclosure property turned into a partnership
deal. On a whim, I pitched an offer to the Bank of Florida on an REO property it had
listed. I offered 75 percent of the listed price and asked for 100-percent seller financ-
ing (because I didn’t have any money). To my surprise, the bank accepted the offer,
but I faced another challenge — I still had no money to cover the cost of repairs
and renovations and other expenses.
One of the real estate agents in my office had heard about my deal and offered to
put up the cash I needed in exchange for a 50/50 split. I had the time and energy but
no money, and he had no time but extra cash to put to work.
Six months later, we each walked away with several thousands of dollars in our
pockets.

You can also trade experience for cash or credit by partnering with
someone who has the cash or can qualify for loans when you can’t.
Perhaps the person has lots of cash or a stronger equity position
to borrow against.
Trading cash or credit for experience
If you have plenty of money or a solid credit score but little experi-
ence as an investor, you may be in a better position to find a part-
ner who’s more experienced than you. You deliver the money, and
the other investor provides the skills and know-how to find great
deals and make them profitable for both of you.
Even if you’re just the moneyman or -woman, we encourage you to
acquire some basic skills and knowledge. The more you know about
the real estate market in your area, the safer your investment is.
Take an interest in the properties that your more knowledgeable
partner is dealing in, and pick your partner’s brain to find out as
much as possible. If anything were to happen to your partner, would
you be able to sort out where all the money and assets are? Decide
who’s going to keep the books, and review them together on a regu-
lar and frequent basis.
Trading cash for credit or vice versa
Most real estate deals require a combination of cash and credit.
You need cash for a down payment and closing costs, and credit
for the rest. In some partnerships, one partner has a stronger posi-
tion in terms of cash, and the other has a better credit history.
Working together, they can make deals happen that neither of them
could do on their own.
Drawing Up a Partnership
Agreement
Establishing a partnership requires no formal steps, but having a
partnership agreement in place can be very useful in avoiding prob-
lems down the road. A partnership agreement lays out all the rules
governing the relationship — who’s in charge of what, how much
money each partner is contributing, how they’re going to divide the
workload, and how they plan to share the profits (and losses). It
also spells out how the partners divvy up the assets in the event
that the parties choose to dissolve the partnership. This section
gives you the lowdown on putting such an agreement in place.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
214

Without an agreement in writing, any conflict resolution occurs not
in accordance with what you and your partners agreed on but rather
by the guidelines in the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and Revised
Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA). Ask your attorney whether your
state has adopted either of these acts, because it may affect the way
the partnership is handled upon dissolution.
Drafting the agreement
A partnership agreement is only as good as the details it contains.
Simply by going through the process of writing up an agreement
and discussing its terms, you and your partner can clarify your
roles, responsibilities, and division of profits and losses.
Your partnership agreement should cover the following:
 Nature and purpose: State the type of business, the purpose
of your relationship, and the exact roles that each of you will
play in the partnership.
 Capital contributions: State how much startup capital each
partner is contributing to the business and how each will be
reimbursed after the business becomes profitable. If more
capital is necessary later, what percentage of the needed capi-
tal is each partner responsible for contributing? What hap-
pens if that partner can’t contribute his or her portion?
 Profit and loss sharing: Specify how the partners will share
any profits or losses, including how the accounting will be
done and how profits and losses will be reported to all part-
ners. Consult an accountant who’s experienced in working
with real estate investors, and review the records with all
partners periodically.
 Authority: How much authority does each partner have in
making decisions? Do you each have equal say in which prop-
erties you purchase? Are each of you planning to be involved
in the overall strategy — buy and sell or buy and rent? Spell
out exactly which of you is the final decision-maker. What hap-
pens in the event of a tie?
 Signature authority: Who has the authority to sign checks,
documents, and agreements? Are two or more signatures
required, or does one person hold sole authority?
Even if you have an agreement with the bank that two signa-
tures (yours and your partner’s) are required on all checks,
don’t expect the bank to enforce the rule. The bank may only
be responsible for any losses due to fraudulent activities that
Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 215

have occurred in the past 30 days. Carefully review your
finances monthly to look for any payments that seem out of
the ordinary.
 Addition of new partners: If you add new partners later, how
will the profits be divided? Make sure you address this subject
well in advance of taking on any new partners.
 Partner problems: What happens if one partner becomes
incapacitated? How are you protected in the event of a
divorce or bankruptcy by a partner?
 Dissolution of the partnership: This provision is one of the
most important areas of any partnership agreement. If the
partnership dissolves for whatever reason, this arrangement
provides you and your partners with an exit strategy. Your
partnership agreement should cover the following:
• Death of a partner: If a partner dies, how will that part-
ner’s share of the assets be distributed? Will they be
given to the deceased’s family or distributed among
other partners?
• Buyout: Under what conditions can partners buy out the
interest of another partner — death, divorce, bank-
ruptcy, illegal activity? Specify the circumstances and
how the buyout amount is to be calculated.
• Division of property: Describe exactly how you plan on
dividing the shared assets. Do you plan to assign certain
properties to each partner or liquidate the properties
and divide the cash?
• Ongoing transactions: If a partner who is leaving has
outstanding transactions, what percentage of the profits,
if any, are the other partners entitled to?
Your partnership agreement should also indicate whether this is a
general or limited partnership. In a general partnership, all partners
share in the management and liability of the team. Limited partners
have little or no say in the management of the team and can limit
their personal exposure to liability. Defining what being in a limited
partnership means can be confusing and complex, so consult your
attorney.
Drawing up a partnership agreement can be a very complex opera-
tion, so consult an attorney with experience in this area. When draw-
ing up and signing a partnership agreement, you and your partner
each should bring your own attorney. In addition to protecting each
partner’s interests, this arrangement gives each partner the confi-
dence that the process is being handled properly and equitably.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
216

Complying with the tax code
One advantage of a partnership is that for tax purposes, the IRS
doesn’t recognize the partnership as a separate entity; thus, the
profits and losses flow through to the individual partners, and the
entity itself doesn’t have to pay taxes.
Even so, the IRS still requires that the partnership file a separate
tax return showing its profits (or losses). As long as you keep
detailed financial records for each property, completing a return
for the partnership isn’t exactly rocket science, but you should still
consult with a tax specialist who’s experienced in working with
real estate investors. In addition to filling out all the paperwork for
you, a tax specialist can offer tax-savings tips that can more than
cover the cost of hiring a specialist.
Avoiding Common Pitfalls
Partnerships dissolve for the same reasons that relationships com-
monly fall apart — lack of communication. To avoid most of the
pitfalls of partnerships, meet with your partners regularly — at
least once per week — to keep everyone in the loop. Be prepared
to meet even more often when challenges arise or new opportuni-
ties present themselves. At these meetings, be sure you
 Review the current status of each project and timelines for
completion.
 Review the income/expense statements since the last meeting
to make sure your current projects are on solid financial footing.
 Discuss new developments or changes on projects.
The meeting should be a place for conversation and constructive
discussion. Every partner should have a voice, but refrain from neg-
ative comments or arguments. A problem isn’t something to argue
over — it’s a challenge that you must work together to overcome.
When an investment becomes particularly challenging, one partner
is likely to feel more responsible for the problems than the other
and may be inclined to hide the problems from the partner. If you
begin to feel this way about a particular investment, it’s the first
sign of trouble. Instead of hiding the problem, share it with your
partner, who may have a creative solution. One of the main bene-
fits of having a partner is for the person’s support when times are
tough. Don’t cut your partner out of the picture at a time when you
really need him.

Partnership gone to pot
Mary and her brother decided to form a partnership. She was sharp and had excel-
lent insight into the local real estate market, which enabled her to spot great oppor-
tunities and transform them into pure gold. They both had a fairly strong work ethic and
were good with their hands, so they could work together on repairs and renovations.
Unfortunately, Mary’s brother turned into somewhat of a slacker. They acquired a
run-down rental property with a lot of potential, but Mary found herself getting stuck
with all the work. After investing a great deal of time and effort over the course of
several weeks fixing up the property, she began to resent her “partnership” with
her brother.
When Mary finally found a buyer for the property, she no longer felt that the 50/50
split they had agreed upon was fair. A dispute ensued, and he refused to sign off on
the title, causing the deal to fall apart. When they finally came to an agreement, the
buyer was long gone, and they had to accept $12,000 less the next time around.
They haven’t spoken since.
Although we can offer no surefire way to avoid situations such as this one, clearer
communication early on could have saved this partnership. If Mary and her brother
had agreed in advance on details regarding workload and tasks each of them would
be responsible for, her brother may have realized early on that this partnership was
something he was ill-prepared to do, or perhaps he would have felt more compelled
to pitch in his 50 percent if it were in writing.

H
ow can you purchase real estate when you’re flat broke? The
good news is that other investors have done it. Despite the
credit crunch that started in 2008, strategies are available to secure
financing even when you have little or no money for a down payment.
You just need to think more creatively and work with financial profes-
sionals who can think outside the cubicle. This chapter reveals some
effective strategies and shows you how to employ them.
As you’re reading this chapter, you may get the feeling that you’re
watching one of those get-rich-quick TV infomercials about making
millions in real estate. Are no-money-down deals really possible? Is
making millions in real estate really that easy? Yes and no. No-money-
down deals are possible, but we’re not promoting easy, no-risk riches
in real estate. The arrangements we describe in this chapter do carry
some risk and require some effort to pull together. In addition, you
still have to find properties with plenty of profit potential and trans-
form those diamonds in the rough into real gems.

Financing Your Down Payment
with a Second Mortgage
Although we talk about various financing options as though they
exist in a vacuum, investors commonly use two or more financing
programs to fund a single project. An investor may, for example,
take out a first mortgage to cover 80 to 90 percent of the purchase
price, a second mortgage to cover the down payment, and a con-
struction loan to cover the cost of repairs and renovations.
One of the most common ways to mix and match loan programs is
through an 80-20 loan, commonly called a piggy-back loan, as dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Taking out an 80-20 loan
When you don’t have enough money to buy a property, you borrow
the necessary dough. If you don’t have money for the down pay-
ment, borrow that, too. Although tough to find, you can go with an
80-20 loan. The only catch is that you have to disclose the details
to the lenders, so they’re fully aware of what you’re doing.
An 80-20 loan is actually two loans that cover the purchase price:
 80: The first mortgage covers 80 percent of the purchase price.
 20: A second mortgage covers a 20-percent down payment.
As you may have guessed, you can get creative with the 80-20 loan
strategy. If, for example, the first mortgage holder requires only 
10 percent down, you can do a 90-10 loan.
80-20 loans are often perfect for situations in which the value of the
repaired property will be significantly more than the purchase
price. Say you’re buying a run-down property with a current market
value of about $180,000 that would be worth about $250,000 if you
fixed it up. You take out a first mortgage for $144,000, a second
mortgage for $36,000, and secure other financing or use your own
money to cover the cost of repairs and renovations (maybe
$20,000).
You now have $200,000 into a property that’s worth $250,000. You
just created $50,000 in equity. You can now pull that equity out of
the property by refinancing the second mortgage for close to the
full value of the property, minus the balance on the first mortgage.
If you refinanced the second mortgage for $60,000, for example
(leaving the property at an 82 percent LTV), you could pay off the

$36,000 plus the $20,000 in repairs and renovations, walk away
with $4,000, and still have $46,000 worth of equity in the property.
Ever since the mortgage meltdown of 2008, lenders have shied
away from these piggy-back loans. Although these loans may be
harder to find in a slumping market, however, they’re always avail-
able. You may just have to look a little harder to find them.
Disclosing your second mortgage
When you take out a second mortgage to cover the down payment,
you compromise your ability to make your payments when times
are tough, and you weaken the lender’s position. You now have
none of your own money tied up in the property, so you can afford
to be less committed to it. Also, if the lender has to foreclose, it
has to deal not only with you but also with the holder of the
second mortgage.
Lenders generally require a 10 to 20 percent down payment on a
property to ensure repayment of the loan. The down payment
gives you a vested interest in the property and offers some assur-
ance to the lender that the property is worth more than you owe
on it. If you encounter cash flow problems and have trouble
making the payments, you may be able to borrow against that
down payment (the equity you have in the property) to buy your-
self some time. If you default on the loan and the lender has to sell
the property, that down payment can help it recoup any loss.
Because 80-20 loans increase the first mortgage holder’s risk, the
law requires that you disclose the second mortgage and your plans
to use it to cover the down payment. When you fill out the loan
application, be sure to enter any information about “subordinate
financing” in the space provided. Otherwise, you’re committing a
form of fraud known as a silent second (see the nearby sidebar).
Wholesaling for Fun and Profit
If you’ve watched episodes of any house-flipping show or read any
of the dozen or so books on the art of flipping houses (including
Ralph and Joe’s Flipping Houses For Dummies), you know the
basics. You buy a house below market value, fix it up, and sell it.
Do it right and you earn a decent profit — 20 percent or better.
Some investors don’t like the whole fix-it-up part of the process, so
they skip that part. They buy a property below market value, mark
up the price, and place it back on the market. Others don’t even
like to touch the property, so they skip another step — they act as
Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 221

bird dogs for other real estate investors, simply scoping out the best
properties and charging a finder’s fee. It’s pure middleman stuff.
Wholesaling allows you to buy and sell a property quickly without
ever actually taking possession of the property and without paying
any financing costs. In the following sections, we show you a
couple of ways to execute these transactions properly.
Buying and selling options
One of the safest ways (legally and financially) to control proper-
ties is to purchase an option or right to sell the property. By pur-
chasing an option, you’re not tying yourself to a purchase
agreement, which legally binds you to following through with the
purchase if you can’t find someone to buy the property.
With an option agreement, you have the right, not the obligation, to
purchase the property by a specified date. If you choose not to
exercise your option or the option expires, you lose only the money
used to purchase the option. In the following sections, we give you
the lowdown on wholesaling by buying and selling options.
Buying options
Buying an option simply requires that you and the property owner
sign a contract and that you pay the owner the agreed-upon amount
for the option to purchase the property. Your attorney can draw up
an option agreement for you or provide you with a boilerplate you
can modify for different situations.
How much you pay for an option varies depending on the property’s
value, current market conditions, and the direction you and the
owner think the market is going. In most cases, you can expect to
pay anywhere from 1 to 5 percent of the property’s true market
value. Of course, the less you pay, the less pressure you’re under to
eventually buy the property.
An option agreement may also include language that makes you
responsible for other expenses related to the property. The owner,
for example, may require that you pay property taxes and insur-
ance for the duration of the option. Such requests aren’t unusual
or unreasonable; you must gauge for yourself whether the terms
work for you. Just make sure that you can assign the option (trans-
fer it to another person).
Selling future cash-flow or equity positions
When you own an option, you control the property and can tap
into all the benefits that come with that control. In exchange for
upfront cash, you can offer a partner or investor an option on

The secret life of a silent second
To get around the down-payment requirement, some real estate insiders encour-
age home buyers to bend the rules by using a silent second mortgage (or silent
second for short). A silent second is a mortgage loan from another lender or the
seller that covers the down payment but isn’t disclosed to the first mortgage lender.
The silent second essentially fools the lender into thinking that you’re a more qual-
ified borrower than you really are.
Many people try to justify this strategy by saying, “Nothing is silent about this mort-
gage. I know about it, and the person lending me the money for the silent second
knows about it. The bank lending me the money for the first mortgage is getting its
required 10-percent down payment, so why should it care?” Well, the bank cares
because several problems accompany silent second scenarios:
 By using a silent second, you’re borrowing 100 percent of the home’s value. If
property values dip or you fail to maintain the property, it can quickly become
worth less than you owe on it. If you default on the loan, the lenders won’t be
able to sell the property for enough to cover the balance due.
 A silent second falsely qualifies you for perks (such as a lower interest rate and
not having to pay mortgage insurance) that you don’t really qualify for.
 Silent seconds mislead the lender into approving a loan application it may have
rejected had you provided accurate financial information.
Whenever you apply for a loan, you must sign a Uniform Residential Loan Application,
often referred to as a 1003 (ten-oh-three), stating that the information you provided
on the loan application is accurate and complete. Omitting a “minor” detail, such as
a silent second, makes you guilty of committing mortgage fraud — a felony. No
matter how harmless it may seem, no matter how many other people are doing it,
it’s still fraud, so don’t do it.
What if your relatives loan you the money? If they loan you the money, you still fall
in the silent second scenario. Now, if they give you the money, you’re safe and have
committed no crime.
Remember, whenever you fail to disclose information to the lender that may com-
promise your ability to obtain loan approval, whatever the reason, it results in
deceiving the lender and failing to honor the letter and the spirit of the law. Using a
silent second is a crime.
future cash flow from the property or an eventual equity position if
certain conditions are met:
 Cash flow: If you’re investing in a rental property, you can offer
your partner or investor a certain percentage of the monthly
profits for a given period of time or until you eventually sell
the property.

 Equity position: If you’re planning on fixing up and selling the
property, you can offer your partner or investor a certain per-
centage of any profit you earn when you sell the property.
When scoping out prospective partners or investors, ask about their
investment goals. Are they looking for a steady cash flow or to score
a quick profit, or are they open to either strategy? By finding out
about their goals, you can more easily determine whether you’re the
right fit and what sort of terms to offer them. If the proposed cash
flow makes sense, you can even split the equity or cash flow into
portions, selling off percentages of each to different investors.
Typically this strategy only makes sense in larger commercial prop-
erties. Refer to Chapter 13 for more on utilizing partnerships.
Negotiating tenant sale options
When you control a property with a lease option agreement, as
explained in Chapter 12, you can negotiate your own lease option
with another tenant. In tougher markets with tighter credit, leasing
a property may be easier than selling or flipping it.
In these circumstances, you can negotiate an attractive lease option
for your tenant on top of your option, providing for some additional
cash flow in the spread (difference between the two lease amounts).
This is a great arrangement if you’re dealing with a real dontwanner
(as in “the owner don’t want her”) or a long-distance seller who has
no use for the property (such as an estate situation).
Make sure your tenant’s option to buy expires several months
before yours, so if your tenant decides not to exercise her option,
you have plenty of time to make other arrangements, such as
obtaining the financing you need to exercise your option.
Assigning a purchase agreement
A somewhat riskier way to practice wholesaling is to tie up the
property with a purchase agreement, find a buyer for the property
who’s willing to pay more than you agreed to pay for it, and then
assign your purchase agreement to the buyer. In the following sec-
tions, we show you how it’s done.
Securing the right to buy and sell the property
The first step in wholesaling is to get the property owner/seller to
agree to sell you the property with the option to sell it to someone
else. You pitch your offer the same way you would if you were
actually buying the property for yourself — you present a pur-
chase agreement. (Your real estate agent or attorney can assist you
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
224

in wording it properly for your jurisdiction. For specifics on negoti-
ating a purchase agreement, check out Real Estate Investing For
Dummies, by Eric Tyson and Robert S. Griswold [Wiley].) The pur-
chase agreement should include the following adjustments:
 Instead of listing yourself as the buyer, you list yourself as
“and/or assignees.” This wording means that either you or
someone else can buy the property.
 Set a closing date at least 60 days from the time the agree-
ment is fully executed. The more time you have to sell the
property, the better.
 Make the purchase agreement conditional upon the property
passing inspection. You don’t want to get stuck with a lemon.
 Disclose the fact that you’re purchasing the property as an
investor and not to reside in yourself. Otherwise, you may
expose yourself to legal issues — such as claims that you’re
illegally flipping the property to inflate its value.
Selling your interest
After you secure controlling interest in the property, you essentially
become the seller’s real estate agent. Your job is to find a buyer.
You can accomplish this goal in all sorts of ways — advertising the
property in the local papers, listing it online, networking with other
investors, or selling it to a friend or relative.
Advertise the property for more than you agreed to pay the seller
but less than the property’s true market value. Otherwise, you may
get stuck holding the property beyond the time you’ve given your-
self to sell it in the purchase agreement.
As soon as you find a buyer, attach an addendum to the contract
essentially stating that you’re assigning the contract to the buyer
for a certain amount of money. The seller, you, and the buyer must
sign the addendum. After you do, you can contact the escrow com-
pany to process the transaction and schedule the closing.
Any gain you realize on the sale of your option becomes a short-
term gain, qualifying as taxable income. If you do several of these,
you may be considered a dealer and may need to secure a real estate
license. Check with your accountant and the state licensing board.
If you can’t find a buyer in time, in accordance with the contract,
you lose your deposit (at the very least). You also lose a lot of credi-
bility and can be sued for specific performance and be forced by the
seller, through the courts, to purchase the property. Securing an
option is a much safer route to take. See “Buying and Selling Options”
earlier in this chapter for details.
Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 225

Selling the Tax Benefits
When April 15 rolls around, every homeowner remembers one of the
primary benefits of owning real estate in America — tax deductions.
Thanks to the huge amount of interest homeowners typically pay on
their mortgage, they can often itemize their deductions to claim a
bigger tax write-off than they’d get from a standard deduction.
Although investors don’t always get the same tax breaks as home-
owners, you can deduct expenses against any income you receive
from renting or selling properties to help reduce your taxes. Real
estate investors are well aware of these tax breaks, but some fail to
realize that they may be able to earn a profit by selling their tax
savings to others.
This strategy may sound a little strange at first, but realize that
every property has expenses, and every expense represents a
potential deduction. Deductions are there for the taking, and the
IRS really doesn’t care who takes credit for them as long as only
one party uses each deduction.
Investors receiving or due to receive significant capital gains from
their investments may be looking for ways to offset those gains
with capital losses. As such, they may be looking for short-term
deductions or losses as a trade-off for long term equity or cash
flow. If you don’t need the deductions, consider selling them to
someone who does.
Consult a tax advisor or accountant for advice on handling such
transactions appropriately. You don’t want to get yourself in a situ-
ation in which you and other investors are mistakenly claiming the
same expenses as deductions. In addition, keep in mind that when
you sell a tax benefit, you’re losing deductions that could benefit you
when tax time rolls around. Make sure you’re earning enough selling
tax benefits in excess of what those benefits would save you in taxes.
Trading Spaces: 1031 Exchanges
Another idea for a no-money-down option is executing a trade. A
1031 exchange is a strategy for deferring the payment of capital gains
taxes on the profit of a sale. This exchange treats the sale of the first
property and the purchase of the second as a single transaction —
an exchange.
A 1031 exchange is sort of like an IRA (individual retirement account)
rollover. With an IRA rollover, you can avoid paying taxes and penal-
ties on money withdrawn from one retirement account by depositing

Flipping contracts? Tread carefully
Some real estate investment gurus promote a strategy called flipping contracts,
which involves a double-closing — often referred to as a pass-through transaction.
We strongly discourage you from doing it, but we believe you should understand
how this scheme works in case someone calls it something different and tries to
convince you it’s okay. Here’s how it works:
1. You (the contract flipper) sign a purchase agreement with the seller obtaining
the right to purchase the property by a specified date.
You pay a deposit — typically anywhere from about 1 to 10 percent of the asking
price. (You agree to buy the property for less than market value so you can sell
at or slightly below market value and earn a profit.)
2. You find a buyer who signs a purchase agreement with the commitment to pay
more for the property than you’ve agreed to pay the seller.
The typical goal is to earn $5,000 to $10,000, but this amount can vary.
3. The seller deeds the property to you, depositing the deed with an escrow 
company.
4. You deed the property to the buyer, depositing the deed with the escrow 
company.
5. The buyer obtains financing, giving the lender instructions to pay the loan pro-
ceeds to the escrow company.
6. The escrow company performs two closings back-to-back — closing the deal
between you and the buyer and between you and the seller.
You receive your profit, the seller receives the remaining proceeds, and the
escrow company records the deeds with the county’s register of deeds, show-
ing the buyer as the new legal owner of the property.
Flipping contracts may sound rosy, but we strongly discourage you from doing so
for several reasons, including the following:
 Flipping contracts is borderline fraud. Traditionally, a property’s market value
is determined by the price a seller is willing to accept and a buyer is willing to
pay (whichever is lower). By jacking up the price as a middleman, you’re artifi-
cially inflating the market value.
 You put your reputation on the line. Reputable real estate investors rarely
engage in this practice. We suggest only a more experienced investor do so.
it into another qualifying retirement account within a certain
number of days. The same principle applies to 1031 exchanges.
You can sell one qualifying property and buy another of equal or
greater value (within a certain period) to avoid paying a capital
gains tax on the profit from the sale.

Without such an exchange, any profit from the sale is subject to cap-
ital gains tax, which can negatively affect your cash flow and pur-
chase power. If you pay a short-term capital gains tax of 30 percent,
for example, on the sale of a $300,000 property, you pay $90,000 in
taxes and have only $210,000 left to make your next purchase.
Qualifying for a 1031 exchange
To fully qualify for a 1031 exchange, the two properties must meet
the following conditions:
 The two properties must be like kind. This rule essentially
means that they have to be investment properties both
located in the United States. You can exchange a farm for an
office building, but you can’t exchange an office building in
the U.S. for an office building in Italy or vice versa. (Like kind
applies to real estate investments, not primary residences or
vacation homes.)
 The purchase price of the property you’re receiving must
be greater than or equal to the purchase price of the prop-
erty you’re giving up. In other words, you can’t exchange a
more valuable property from one of lesser value and pocket
all the proceeds; although you can do a partial exchange as
long as you pay taxes on the net gain, as discussed later in
this section.
 All the equity in the property you’re giving up must be used
to acquire the replacement property. In other words, you
can’t use any proceeds from the exchange for other purposes,
such as fixing up the property you received in the exchange
or buying yourself a new car (too bad for the auto industry).
You can qualify for partial exchanges under the rules, but whatever
profits you walk away with after the exchange are subject to capital
gains tax. For example, if you sell a property for $200,000 in exchange
for one you purchase for $175,000, your $25,000 profit is subject to
capital gains tax.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 
228
 Doing a quick flip like this makes the property ineligible for certain types of
financing. HUD has an anti-flipping provision for FHA-insured loans; it won’t
finance any property that has been transferred within the last 90 days, and
requires two appraisals for any property that’s had a transfer of ownership in 91
to 180 days (to confirm the property’s true market value). A double-closing that
hikes up the price of the property in a matter of seconds obviously makes it inel-
igible for FHA financing. This guideline has also become standard practice for
most conventional lenders.

Meeting the deadlines
To qualify for a 1031 exchange, not only must the properties qualify,
but you must also meet the deadlines for processing the buy and
sell transactions. You can’t sell a property today, buy another one
six months later, and claim the exchange exemption. Your transac-
tion must fall within the following two deadlines:
 Identification period: You have 45 days from the day you close
on the sale of the first property to identify a replacement. You
can choose more than one property (and probably should) just
in case you can’t close on your first choice in time.
 Exchange period: You have 180 days from the day you close
on the sale of the first property to close on the purchase of
the replacement property.
These cut-off dates are firm — you don’t get an extension or grace
period if the deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.
You do need to disclose the exchange on your tax return. 
Consult your accountant to make sure you comply with the 
disclosure rules that govern 1031 exchanges.
Selling Other Equitable Interests
When dealing with larger commercial properties or unique real
estate holdings, you can get even more creative with financing
because you have more assets to offer for sale or trade. What else
does the property offer? Do you have billboards you can lease out
or space for a health club to divide off? Does the property have a
remote corner that would be good for hunting or other recreation?
You can use any or all of these options (and options like them) to
finance your project.
After you control the property, you can harness the power of that
property’s assets to secure quick cash to fund the deal or generate
cash flow. In the following sections, we offer some suggestions.
Leaseholds and other rights
Many investors have gotten rich by buying real estate and quickly
leasing off their interests while retaining rights to the land itself.
Using leaseholds or leasehold estates, you can sell the property rights
while retaining ownership of the land. Just north of me (Chip), for
example, many property owners are leasing groundwater rights to
Nestle Corporation for its bottling plants. As soon as the leasehold
expires, the land reverts to the original owner.
Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 229

You can lease your property rights to gas and oil companies, cities
and towns (for water), farmers (for harvesting corn or wheat),
ranchers (for cattle grazing), logging companies, and so forth.
Timber or logging rights can bring in substantial sums to finance to
acquisition or to repair and renovate a property. One investor pur-
chased 80 acres of land and leased off the hardwood timber rights
for $40,000 a year, which covered the down payment and construc-
tion costs on the home. He subsequently sold off the excess land
and then sold the house for a $100,000 profit. The best part: The
government financed everything.
Naming rights, air rights, and 
other unimaginable stuff
Many owners of investment properties are too close to their own
deal to envision all the possibilities. Due to their short-sightedness,
they often overlook golden opportunities and leave a lot of money
on the table. When you’re looking for extra sources of capital to
fund a deal, replace cash you already borrowed, or generate addi-
tional revenue streams, open your mind to all the possibilities. Here
are some ideas that can begin to stimulate your own creativity:
 Lease the naming rights of the building. Some companies are
willing to pay big bucks to have a stadium named after them.
Lucas Oil, for example, agreed to pay the Indianapolis Colts
$120 million over 20 years for the honor of having the Colts’
new stadium named after the company. Although it didn’t
quite cover the entire $500 million price tag, it helped ease
some of the sticker shock.
 Create leases for air rights with radio, television, or satellite
services off the roof. One of the most famous real estate deals —
the creation and sale of the air rights for New York’s Empire
State Building — instantly doubled the building’s value.
 Allow a cellphone carrier to construct a cell tower in a
remote corner of the property or on top of the roof. These
can be very lucrative leases. I (Chip) have a client who owns a
small home on about 10 acres. Her mortgage payment is only
$362, but on a high corner of her property sits a 2,500 square
foot fence guarding a cell transfer tower that generates $1,467
per month for the next 10 years guaranteed!
 Sell off mailing leases for valuable addresses. Folks in high-
rent districts like Manhattan or Beverly Hills often sell rights
to their mailing addresses to small companies looking for an
established or well-known address.

Ten Ways to Avoid Common
Beginner Blunders
In This Chapter
 Overcoming any obsession over low interest rates
 Performing your due diligence
 Comparison-shopping for the best deal
 Staying abreast of current real estate market conditions
M
any ill-informed investors become overenthusiastic about
the big picture and lose sight of the critical details that can
make or break a deal. They pay too much for a property, underesti-
mate the cost of repairs and renovations, fail to inspect a property
or research the title, or sign contracts they don’t fully understand.
You shouldn’t overanalyze to the point of paralysis, but you do need
to stay on top of the details from beginning to end. In this chapter,
we present ten common real estate financing blunders to help you
avoid costly mistakes and maximize your profits from the very start.
Focusing on More than Just 
a Low Interest Rate
When shopping for attractive financing, novice investors often get
so hung up on interest rates that they talk themselves out of great
deals. They meet a hard-money lender who’s charging six points
and 10 percent interest and immediately think the person is ripping
them off. Instead of thinking about how much the other person is
earning, focus your thoughts on what you stand to earn.

If the numbers work, the interest rate and fees don’t matter. Financing
fees and interest are just another cost to include in your calculations.
If you can afford the financing and still earn the desired profit, don’t
worry about what you’re paying. Having access to the money you
need to do the deal is what matters most.
Getting Preapproved
In the excitement of shopping for potentially profitable investment
properties, you may be tempted to shove the question of paying
for it aside. Don’t do it. Before you start shopping for investment
properties, meet with your loan officer or mortgage broker and get
preapproval. You can then move quickly and decisively when you
discover potentially profitable properties.
Although most people generally shop first and think about paying
for stuff later, this strategy compromises your ability to negotiate
an attractive purchase price and terms. You can certainly present a
purchase agreement that includes as a condition your ability to
secure financing, but if another buyer shows up with cash or
preapproved financing, she has a significant advantage.
Doing Your Homework: 
Property Research
The real estate community has a saying: “Buyers are liars, and sellers
are worse.” When you’re thinking about buying a property, don’t take
anything the seller tells you at face value. Don’t rely solely on seller
disclosures to identify potential problems. Do your own research:
 Obtain a title commitment (refer to Chapter 12) to make sure the
person selling the property is the rightful owner and that the
property is unencumbered by other liens (claims against 
the property).
 Visit the property and inspect it as closely as possible with
your own two eyes. Take the following pledge: “My eyes or no
buys.” Never buy a property site unseen. For more about eval-
uating properties, check out Foreclosure Investing For Dummies
by Ralph R. Roberts and Joe Kraynak, Real Estate Investing For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown, and
Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies by Peter Conti
and Peter Harris (all by Wiley).
Part V: The Part of Tens 
234

 Get a comparative market analysis from your agent (see
Chapter 3) to make sure the property’s market value is in line
with the price you’re planning to offer.
 Pick up a copy of the city worksheet on the property by visit-
ing your town hall (or the equivalent). The worksheet contains
a history of the property, including any building permits and
code violations.
 For commercial properties, get records of the property’s
income and expenses for the past two years. Have the seller
supply you with the past couple of years’ tax returns on the
property. (Refer to Chapter 8.)
 Prior to closing, have the property inspected professionally
and resolve any issues before signing the final papers. (Refer
to Chapter 7 for more info.)
 Purchase title insurance for the property (check out Chapter 7)
to protect you in the event that someone claims rights to the
property after closing.
 Check the county tax assessor’s office for tax liens or special
assessments. (Head to Chapter 4 for more info.)
Making a Reasonable 
Down Payment
For investment properties, lenders often demand a hefty down
payment for the most attractive interest rates and terms. A 20-to-25
percent down payment isn’t out of the ordinary.
Keep in mind, however, that the more money you put down on a
property, the less you have available for other investments. You may
be better off paying a higher interest rate with a lower down payment
if you can put that extra money to work in another investment
property.
Instead of putting 25 percent or more down on a property, for
example, try negotiating a seller-held second mortgage, or a land
contract sale with a 10 percent down payment. Fix up the property,
and then refinance it later with the increased equity, so you’re
more likely to qualify for a lower interest rate without such a hefty
down payment.
Conserving cash is best — even if it means having to pay higher
interest rates or increased long-term costs. It’s all about cash flow!
Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Avoid Common Beginner Blunders 235

Comparing at Least Three 
Good Faith Estimates
Financing real estate purchases is the equivalent of shopping for
money, and to find the best deals, you need to comparison-shop.
Obtain at least three Good Faith Estimates (a detailed breakdown of
all the projected loan costs) from different lenders, and compare
the following:
 Interest rate
 Discount points (prepaid interest)
 Closing costs and other fees
 Annual percentage rate (APR) or the percentage rate factoring
in interest, points, and fees
 Term (number of months or years to pay back the loan)
 Any prepayment penalties or refinancing conditions
Although having access to cash trumps concerns over the costs of
financing, you still want to get the best deal possible. For more
about comparing loans, refer to Chapter 6.
Viewing at Least Ten Properties
before Making an Offer
First-time investors often see a property for sale and think to them-
selves, “Wow, this is a prime piece of real estate.” They then pro-
ceed to purchase it without spending any time evaluating the
market. They have no idea what other comparable properties are
selling for or what those properties have to offer. As a result, they
often pay far too much.
The first property you see may be the best deal around, but you
don’t know that until you look around. Make a rule to view at least
ten comparable properties before making an offer on one of them.
Doing so forces you to slow down and make better-informed deci-
sions. As you become more familiar with your market, you can
begin to evaluate them much more quickly and accurately without
having to follow this ten-for-one rule.

Checking Your Credit Score 
before Applying for a Loan
Credit is the one thing you can’t buy. When you apply for a loan,
the first thing the lender does is check your credit score and his-
tory. If you have a lousy credit score and a checkered financial
past, the lender is going to either reject your loan application or
curb the risk by requiring a larger down payment, charging higher
interest and fees, and perhaps even requiring that you purchase
private mortgage insurance (PMI).
To avoid wasting time (the lender’s and yours) and enduring costly
loans, check your credit score and history before applying for a
loan. If your report contains any errors, contact the credit report-
ing agency and have them corrected, if possible.
If your credit score is below 680, work toward improving it. Pay
your bills on time, pay down any large balances you’re carrying on
credit cards, and take other steps to boost your score. Chapter 3
offers some additional suggestions.
Buying with Your Brain 
and Not Your Heart
You may fall in love with a property, but don’t follow the dictates of
your heart when investing in real estate. Remember, this is busi-
ness (not a hobby), and the numbers have to work. Depending on
your strategy, take one of the following two courses:
 Buy and sell: If you’re buying the property to sell it for a profit,
shoot for at least a 20-percent profit and account for all of your
expenses, including purchase price, repair and renovation
expenses, holding costs (taxes, insurance, interest), marketing
costs, and sales commissions.
 Buy and hold: If you’re buying the property to rent it out,
make sure it generates a positive cash flow — that annual
income exceeds annual expenses.
Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Avoid Common Beginner Blunders 237

Monitoring the Pulse of Current
Market Conditions
Like the stock market, the real estate market has its ups and
downs. Property values can rise or fall based on local economic
conditions, changes in trends, and a host of other factors.
Homeowners and investors witnessed just how dramatically the
housing market can shift course when the bubble burst in 2008.
Knowledge is power. As an investor, keeping abreast of the fluctua-
tions in the marketplace can pay dividends. It can prevent you
from paying too much for a property, buying the wrong property at
the wrong time, and perhaps even selling too early or too late. All
real estate is local. Make sure you know what’s going on in your
own backyard.
Calculating the NOI and DSCR 
on Commercial Properties
With commercial properties, you focus less on the resale value of a
property and more on the net revenue that property can generate
for you. As a result, you’re not simply looking at the market value
of the property. You need to work the numbers and determine the
property’s NOI and DSCR:
 Net Operating Income (NOI) is the profit the property gener-
ates monthly or annually. To calculate the NOI, you total all
the income the property brings in, and then subtract all your
expenses. 
 Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is the number that lenders
use to evaluate the risk versus the rewards. The higher the ratio,
the better the deal — and the better the financing options. To
calculate the DSCR, divide the NOI by the annual debt service
on the loan (total annual payments on the loan, including inter-
est and principal). A DSCR of 1.00 means that the property is
breaking even. A number of 1.20 indicates that the property 
is generating a decent profit. Riskier properties require a higher
DSCR to justify the risk.
When it comes to investing, the numbers are the only things that
count! Refer to Chapter 8 for additional details about these two 
calculations.

Chapter 16
Ten Steps to Take 
before Closing
In This Chapter
 Examining the appraisal, title commitment, and closing documents
 Insuring the property
 Inspecting the property one last time
 Having your money ready to go
T
he actual closing (when you receive rights to the property and
pay the seller) is typically uneventful — or at least everyone
involved hopes it will be. To ensure that the closing proceeds with-
out a glitch, you need to prepare in advance. You don’t want to be
one of those inexperienced buyers who insist on reading every
single word of every document at the closing table or shows up
without the funds needed to close the deal.
In this chapter, we provide you with a checklist of ten things to do
prior to closing to make sure your closing proceeds as smoothly as
possible. You don’t need to complete the items in the order pre-
sented here — just make sure you’ve attended to all the details
prior to closing.
Get and Review a Copy 
of the Appraisal
As part of the process your lender follows in evaluating your loan
application, it orders an appraisal. Obtain a copy of the appraisal
and use it to double-check your calculations (to make sure the
property you’re about to purchase is likely to be profitable).

With the appraisal, your lender wants to ensure the following:
 The property value is in line with the purchase price.
 The property (unless it’s a construction or rehabilitation loan)
shows the potential to generate more than enough annual
income to cover the annual loan payments.
If the appraiser seems to think that the property isn’t worth the
purchase price or that it won’t generate sufficient income to cover
the payments, the lender will probably reject your loan applica-
tion. If the lender approves your loan despite flags raised by the
appraiser, you should still be concerned about purchasing a ques-
tionable investment property.
So what if the numbers don’t work? You have two choices:
 Proceed: If you decide to proceed with the deal, make sure
the numbers on your pro forma, or projections, are conserva-
tive and realistic and show the lender that the property will
perform — and earn a profit — within the next three years.
 Recede: If you decide to back away from the deal, you may
lose your earnest money deposit (EMD, the money you paid
the seller when you settled on a purchase agreement) and any
other expenses you’ve already paid. If your offer wasn’t condi-
tional on a satisfactory appraisal (including value), you may
also be liable for a specific performance suit that forces you to
complete the transaction.
Review the Title Commitment 
and Obtain Title Insurance
Contact your title company and obtain a copy of the title 
commitment — a report issued prior to closing that shows all liens
and other claims against a property. If the title commitment shows
a lien against the property that the seller failed to disclose or a break
in the chain of ownership (see Chapter 12), call this discrepancy to
the attention of the title company and your attorney. Address any
concerns you have about the title prior to closing.
A title commitment that shows a clean title is no substitute for an
actual title policy, which insures against any losses in the event that
somebody shows up later with a rightful claim against the property.
A title company may miss something during its title search, so
always buy a policy to protect yourself against any oversights.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
240

Review All Closing Documents
As soon as you know who’s handling the closing (usually a title com-
pany, but it can also be an attorney or escrow company), call and
request a closing packet as soon as possible — at least a couple of
days prior to closing so you have time to review all the documents.
The closing packet should include at least the following items:
 Mortgage or land contract
 Deed
 Promissory note
 HUD-1 closing statement (see the following section for details)
Read through the documents to check for spelling or calculation
errors, to ensure your name and other information pertaining to
you is correct, and to verify that the numbers on the HUD-1 match
up with those on the Good Faith Estimate. (See Chapter 6 for more
on Good Faith Estimates.) If anything looks odd, call the title com-
pany and have your issues addressed before closing.
If you have an attorney (and you should), make sure your attorney
also receives a copy of the closing packet prior to closing and
reviews the documents.
Review a Copy of the HUD-1
Closing Statement
The HUD-1 statement is a universal closing statement used for all
residential (and many commercial) loan transactions. For larger
commercial properties, the format’s the same, but it may be pre-
pared on the attorney’s or closing agent’s letterhead or form.
The HUD-1 is a key document — it has all the numbers, and every-
one involved in the transaction must sign off on it to enable the
closing agent to move forward with the disbursements. Although
you can try to get a copy several days in advance, the reality is
that numbers are still coming in at the last minute, and you may
not be able to review the final revised copy until just before the
closing. Ask anyway — according to RESPA, you’re entitled to see a
completed copy of the HUD-1 at least 24 hours in advance.
Chapter 16: Ten Steps to Take before Closing 241

Even though you’re the buyer, review both sides of the form. Look
at every line that has a number next to it and verify that each charge
or credit is listed properly. Review the seller’s side to make sure that
each lien payoff is listed, that taxes are computed correctly, and that
the sellers are paying for the charges agreed to in the Purchase
Agreement. Bring any questionable items or amounts to the atten-
tion of the closing agent as early as possible. By addressing any
HUD-1 issues prior to closing, you can remove at least some of the
unnecessary stress and confusion. You don’t want to be discussing
(or arguing over) charges at the closing.
Get an Insurance Policy
For many homeowners and investors, obtaining an insurance policy
is an afterthought. Meet with your insurance agent and explain the
situation. Make sure your agent knows that this is an investment
property. You’re likely to pay more for a policy on an investment
property, but if you buy a standard homeowner’s policy, it may not
provide sufficient protection or cover any damage.
Why would you obtain insurance before you took ownership? We
can offer you two good reasons:
 The lender requires that you have an insurance policy in
place as a condition for financing the purchase. The lender
wants to make sure insurance is in place to protect its 
investment.
 If the property burns down, blows away, or is swept up in
floodwaters a minute after you sign the closing papers, you
can lose your entire investment.
Insurance also comes in handy if the previous owners of a foreclo-
sure property decide to trash the place out of spite on their way
out the door.
Do a Walk-Through 
on the Property
You may have inspected the property to the point of overkill, but
the day or morning before closing, visit the property again and do a
final walk-through to make sure it’s in the same condition (or
better) as when you submitted your offer. Anything can happen to a
property between the time you first see it and closing, so perform
your due diligence and visit the property prior to closing. Inspect
all four sides from the outside and walk through the interior.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
242

Obtain Utility Final Readings and
Schedule the Transfer
Earning a profit on real estate often hinges on your ability to com-
plete repairs and renovations quickly. If you’ve already scheduled
contractors to start work but you failed to have the water, gas, and
electric turned on, you may end up paying a bunch of workers a lot
of money for sitting around twiddling their thumbs. To avoid this
problem, call the local utility companies (water, gas, and electric)
prior to closing and obtain the final utility readings (or as close as
possible). Let each utility company know that you’re going to be
the new owner and will be transferring the account to your name.
Make sure the HUD-1 lists any outstanding water or sewer bills and
that the seller pays them at closing. These unpaid bills become a lien
on the property. Most other utility charges attach to the previous
owner, not the property.
In some cases, the utility company may not allow you to transfer
the account prior to closing, so you may need to transfer utilities
over to your name immediately after closing. Have your agent con-
tact the sellers and request that they bring their most recent utility
bills to the closing — they contain the phone numbers and account
numbers you need. If necessary, the sellers can then call, request
that the utilities be transferred to you, and then hand the phone to
complete the transfer.
Review Updated Tenant Rent Roll
When purchasing a rental property complete with tenants, obtain
an updated tenant roll prior to closing to be sure no mass exodus
of renters has occurred between the time you negotiated the pur-
chase and the closing. The rent roll should include a listing of each
unit, the tenant, monthly lease amount, lease term and expiration,
deposit amount, and any lease concessions. As a commercial
investor, keep in mind that you’re purchasing not only a building
but also an existing business complete with customers (the ten-
ants). If something has driven your renters from the premises, you
deserve answers.
An updated rent roll at time of closing certifies when the seller
received the most recent lease payments and any deposits being
transferred to you.
Chapter 16: Ten Steps to Take before Closing 243

Make sure the seller didn’t collect advance rents and fail to dis-
close them — that’s money you’ll never be able to recover later.
For major tenants or large properties, we recommend that you
request an estoppel letter from each tenant that confirms the lease
term, payment amount, deposit, and date of last payment.
Have Certified Funds or Wire
Transfer Ready to Go
Showing up to a closing without a certified check in hand or a wire
transfer ready to go for the amount you’re required to pay is like
going on a hot date without your wallet. Your lender is responsible
for making sure the big payment is ready to hand over to the seller,
but you need to show up with your check for the down payment
and closing costs. Make sure it’s a certified check (from your bank)
or a wire transfer.
Bring your checkbook, too, just in case you need to pay for some
unforeseen expenses that appear at closing. Don’t let your lender
or whoever’s handling the closing charge extra fees, but know that
you may have to pay for legitimate out-of-pocket expenses, such as
odd-days interest recalculation, an additional overnight fee for a
disbursement, or an account transfer deposit with a utility com-
pany or other service provider. For assistance in differentiating
between legitimate and illegitimate fees, refer to Chapter 6.
Confirm Date, Time, and 
Location of Closing
A lot of time and effort — and people — have been involved in the
transaction leading up to closing. With so many parties involved,
closings often become major ordeals to conveniently schedule.
Because you don’t want to end up at the wrong place at the wrong
time and have to reschedule, call the closing company or attorney
in charge of the closing a few days before you think the meeting is
scheduled and confirm the date, time, and location.
If you’re not absolutely sure where the closing office is, get the
address and find directions online. If you have one of those GPS
gadgets, all the better. Show up early — if more negotiating needs
to be done, you don’t want it starting without you at the table!

Chapter 17
Ten Tips for Surviving 
a Credit Crunch
In This Chapter
 Looking elsewhere for investment capital
 Focusing on foreclosures, REOs, and short-sale opportunities
 Changing to a buy-and-hold strategy
 Teaming up with a mortgage broker and real estate agent
T
he days of easy credit (in the 1990s and first few years of the
new millennium) may be gone, but savvy investors know that
financing never completely dries up. You can always find lenders
willing to finance promising deals, particularly for real estate
investors who have a proven track record (or at least an excellent
plan for turning a profit).
Although some sort of financing is always available, the landscape
can change. To survive and thrive under the new conditions, you
need to be able to adapt, shift your strategy, and look for money in
less likely places. This chapter offers some suggestions.
Don’t let a slow market get you down. When sales slump, buying
opportunities soar, and this is when savvy investors build wealth.
Expand Your Search
A credit crunch doesn’t mean that financing disappears — it just
means that you probably need to look for it somewhere else. If
you’re accustomed to working through banks, you may need to
explore the hard money option, as presented in Chapter 11. If that’s
not an option, consider seller financing, as discussed in Chapter 12.
If you tried to cut out the middleman by working directly with
lenders, consider working through a broker instead. Having an

expert on your side can give you more options and perhaps even
save you money.
The government can step in during a credit crunch (like it did
during the mortgage meltdown) to stimulate the economy.
Although conventional (nongovernment) loans may be scarcer,
you may discover that government loans, such as FHA loans, are
more accessible.
Choose Properties More Carefully
Financing follows the laws of supply and demand. When money is
tight, banks can afford to pick and choose the people they decide
to loan money to. As a result, they’re going to be very picky about
which deals they finance and which ones they reject when they
start crunching the numbers.
You need to adjust accordingly by selecting properties more care-
fully. Overestimate costs, underestimate profits, and make sure the
worst-case scenario still leaves you with a reasonable profit or pos-
itive cash flow. When the market’s in a slump, you have less room
for error.
Don’t gamble on declining areas or areas where unemployment is
rising. Stick with “bread-and-butter” properties that are easy to fix
up, maintain, and rent out. Of course, it’s not wise to buy into a
booming market, and we’re not telling you to do that, either. Buying
when the market is down can be a savvy move, but opt for more
stable areas and look for early signs of recovery before you go all in.
Focus on Foreclosures
As the economy slows, foreclosure rates gradually increase, but
just as the economy begins to recover, foreclosure rates tend to
spike. The peak in foreclosure rates typically lags behind the slump
in the economy by about a year, because foreclosures take between
7 and 12 months to process. When you’re in a slow economy, big
opportunities lie ahead.
When you’re hunting for bargains on homes, you have to go where
the best sales are happening. In a slow economy, follow the foreclo-
sures. Foreclosures are one of the best ways to acquire properties
at below-market value. For more about finding and buying foreclo-
sure properties, check out Ralph and Joe’s Foreclosure Investing For
Dummies or Chip’s Cashing In on Pre-foreclosures and Short Sales
(both Wiley).
Part V: The Part of Tens 
246

Look for Short-Sale Opportunities
When foreclosures soar, lenders begin looking for opportunities to
minimize their losses, as well. Many lenders are even open to the
possibility of a short sale — accepting less than full payment of the
current balance on the mortgage.
Why would any lender accept less than the homeowner/borrower
owes? Because if lenders don’t settle for less, they stand to lose
even more by ending up with a bad loan on their books and a
house they have to sell in a slumping market. A short sale limits
their loss. With a good credit history and track record, you can
negotiate a low sales price and the financing all at the same time.
To identify short sale opportunities, network with homeowners and
real estate professionals in your area. Real estate agents, attorneys
(especially foreclosure and divorce lawyers), mortgage brokers,
and loan officers often know about families who are having trouble
making their mortgage payments. If you can negotiate a short sale
on behalf of the homeowners, you may be able to purchase the
property at a bargain basement price and still have a little money
left over to help the homeowners move on with their lives.
Never deal with the lenders’ regular customer service representa-
tives. They’re programmed to answer every question with a “no.”
Track down the loss mitigation department. They have the ability
and interest in negotiating with you.
Buy REO Properties
If a bank follows through on a foreclosure, nobody buys the prop-
erty at auction, and the previous owners can’t redeem it (in juris-
dictions that have a redemption period), the bank ends up with the
property. These repo properties are commonly referred to as real
estate owned (REO) or bank owned properties.
In addition to getting stuck with a loan that’s not generating any
income, the bank has to invest more money to fix up the place and
sell it — usually at a loss.
In most cases, banks prefer to clear the bad loan off their books
quickly, sell the property at a reasonable loss to an investor, and
wash their hands of the deal. They may even be willing to finance
the purchase for a qualified investor — turning a bad loan into a
loan that generates revenue for the bank.
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Surviving a Credit Crunch 247

In situations like these, the government also experiences an
increased inventory of REO properties. FHA has a lending program
specifically designed to allow investors to finance REOs. For more
information, go to www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/reo/mm/
mminfo.cfm.
During a credit crunch, consider ramping up your efforts to con-
nect with the REO departments at local and national banks. They
may not be willing to finance your first deal, but after you prove
yourself, they should be more willing to finance your next purchase.
Search for High-Equity Properties
In tough markets, creativity is king. Seek out sellers who have prop-
erties with a lot of equity. These sellers can be much more flexible
in structuring a deal and financing it themselves if they don’t need
the cash or have a huge mortgage payment tied to the property.
The advantage for them is tapping into a higher rate of return than
they can probably get from other investments (and it’s secured by
an asset they’re familiar with — their property).
If the owner is reluctant to take back a mortgage or a land con-
tract, offer a lease-option agreement of your own to get control of
the property. Take some time to fix it up, re-lease it out, or allow
the market to recover a bit and then refinance it or sell it yourself.
Shift from a Buy-Sell to 
a Buy-Hold Strategy
If you’ve been buying and selling properties (fix-and-flip), you may
find that strategy isn’t quite as lucrative when property values take
a dive. Instead of sitting on the sidelines waiting for conditions to
improve, consider shifting to a buy-and-hold strategy — buy 
properties and lease them out, at least until the housing market
turns around.
By leasing the property, you can often ride out a slow market for a
year or two and then put the house up for sale. Real estate prices
tend to recover after huge slumps, at least for good-quality proper-
ties, and if you can afford to hold the property, rental income may
cover your holding costs until the market recovers and you can
sell the house for the price you want.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
248

You can also structure a lease-option purchase, which provides an
opportunity to lock in a buyer now even though the sale occurs later.
Don’t leap into the leasing business blindly. If you’re going to shift
from selling to renting, know what you’re getting yourself into.
Check your tenants’ references and rental history, and carefully
screen your tenants. For more about renting out property, check
out Property Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Robert S.
Griswold (Wiley).
Team Up with Your 
Mortgage Broker
When the market’s soft, the economy is usually in a slump, and
people generally have less money to spend on housing. By teaming
up with a mortgage broker or loan originator, you can often help
first-time home buyers secure the financing they need to purchase
the home. You don’t want to finance the purchase yourself (by offer-
ing seller financing), because that ties up your money, but you can
put prospective buyers in touch with your broker, who can assist
them in securing the financing they need to buy the property from
you. By offering access to financing, you often gain an edge in a slow
market over other sellers who don’t have the vision or the close rela-
tionship with a broker to make the sale happen.
Even during a credit crunch, financing is still available at attractive
terms for first-time homebuyers. Get familiar with FHA and rural
development (RD) loans to get buyers in for as little as 0 percent
down. Rural development loans are available through the USDA
and offer 100 percent financing for development in rural areas. (See
Chapter 9 for more about USDA financing.)
Offer Your Agent a Bonus
If you need to sell a property in a slow market, consider offering
your agent a bonus for selling the property by a certain date. In
slow markets, some investors make the mistake of trying to negoti-
ate a lower commission with their agent. They reason that the
agent needs the work and that the commission is another expense
that eats into their profits.
This strategy often backfires, however. The agent feels insulted and
unmotivated, and the house lingers on the market. The investor
loses more money in holding costs than she gains by reducing the
agent’s commission.
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Surviving a Credit Crunch 249

To increase buyer traffic, consider raising the commission so you
can pay more in commissions to the buyer’s agent. For example, if
your agent typically charges you a 6 percent commission and splits
the commission 50/50 if another agent delivers the buyer, offer
your agent 7 percent so she can afford to offer a bigger commis-
sion to the buyer’s agent.
Don’t advertise a higher sales commission on the Multiple Listing
Service (MLS) or your other marketing materials, because you may
turn off prospective buyers who equate their agents’ enthusiasm
with the fat bonus you’re offering. Instead, work through your agent
to communicate this boost in commission to the buyers’ agents.
Partner Up and Get Creative
When a market turns south, it generally affects everyone. During a
credit crunch, investors get more conservative, just like the banks.
One solution is to team up with other investors and spread the risk.
Join a local real estate investors club, attend meetings, and meet
some fellow investors. Find out what they’re looking for and offer
to partner up on a property to share the risk. Taking on two other
partners diminishes your risk by 67 percent. Of course, you have
to share the rewards as well, but this method is a great way to
acquire several properties and minimize your exposure to a declin-
ing marketplace.
Get a written agreement between all the partners in advance — a
bad market magnifies assumptions and misunderstandings if
things go wrong. For more about partnering, check out Chapter 13.
