About Docker Images

What is a Docker Image?
• An Image deﬁnes a Docker Container. 
• Similar in concept to a snapshot of a VM. 
• Or a class vs an instance of the class. 
• Images are immutable. 
• Once built, the ﬁles making up an image do not change. 

Image Layers
• Images are built in layers. 
• Each layer is an immutable ﬁle, but is a collection of ﬁles and 
directories. 
• Layers receive an ID, calculated via a SHA 256 hash of the layer 
contents. 
• Thus, if the layer contents change, the SHA 256 hash changes 
also.


Image Ids
• Image Ids are a SHA 256 hash derived from the layers. 
• Thus if the layers of the image changes, the SHA 256 hash 
changes  
• The Image ID listed by docker commands (ie ‘docker images’) is the 
ﬁrst 12 characters of the hash.

Image Tag Names
• The hash values of images are referred to by ‘tag’ names. 
• This concept is very confusing at ﬁrst.


Image Tag Names
• The format of the full tag name is: [REGISTRYHOST/]
[USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG] 
• For Registry Host ‘registry.hub.docker.com' is inferred 
• For ‘:TAG’ - ‘latest’ is default, and inferred. 
• Full tag example: registry.hub.docker.com/mongo:latest
