Vixen: Foxy lady of
Granath
MARTECH S H OWE D  T H E I R
appreciation to the gentlemen of the
press last month. Around 30 faces
(more than one sporting a MCP tie)
were wined, dined and entertained at
the launch of their latest game. Vixen.
Martech appear to have pulled out all
the stops on this one, even to the extent
of hiring a model to pose in leopard
skins, presumably as a n  added
incentive t o  the aforementioned
members of the press!
The game itself features a leopard-
skin clad heroine i n  a  role n o t
dissimilar to Martech's Tarzan epic of
last year. "The planet Granath has
been under siege for as long as the sky
has met with the horizon and as long
as the mountains have rolled into the
distance" reads the bumph. "Fo r
millions of years dinosaurs roamed the
planet's surface in search of prey, and
have destroyed all but a few o f the
mammals, and all of the humans — or
have they?"

"Our lone heroine, Vixen, was
raised by wily foxes and has magic
powers. With her ability to change into
a fox and her magic whip in hand.
she is ﬁerce, brave and a match for
any of her foes." I'm sure you get the
drift

THE LATEST INSTALLMENT in
the Bard's Tale series has arrived. The
third in the series of award-winning
medieval fantasy role playing games
will feature more spells, more monsters
and m o r e  dungeons t h a n  i t s
predecessors. In Bards Tale III, the
fabled city of Skara Brae has been left
in ruins. As the townsfolk celebrated
a victory over the evil Mangar (the
objective of Bard's Tale II), his master,
The Mad Dog Tarjan, arrived seeking
revenge and reduced the town to
rubble. Skara Brae is only the ﬁrst in
a long line of cities which Tarjan has
threatened to destroy. The rest is up

he re-releases usually appear in
the massed ranks of the budget
• l a b e l s  but we'll start this update
with news o f  the reappearance o f
International Soccer.
This all time classic CM football
game was one o f the ﬁrst when i t
appeared on a Commodore cartridge
and then starred in countless shop
windows advertising the features of the
"new amazing CM". Now at last it has
made the move to cassette and disk
via CRL with the only' changes being
different names on the advertising
boards that line the pitch.

This month's releases are dominated by old games, as
re-released titles continue to storm the charts
p .
The Archon Collection features
two of the best Electronic Arts strategy
games on one disk. The original
Archon features a chess board and two
armies of pieces facing each other in
a battle between light and dark. Each
piece is a different monster ranging
from unicorns to basilisks and goblins
to trolls and possessing different
strengths and weaknesses. Although
the board may look like a chess board
that's where the similarity ends as in
Archon, if you want to take a piece,
you have to ﬁght for it on a separate
battleﬁeld.

In Archon II the board has been
altered to depict the four elements of
air, earth, ﬁre and water and the
players are sorcerers that conjure up
monsters, demons and elements to win
control of the game.

slickest fastest shoot 'em-up ever!
Armed with a single shot laser blasting
ship you must travel through the
Nemesis style screens collecting green
orbs that increase your ﬁre power or
can be shot to turn them into screen
clearing smart bombs. Once you've
trebled your ﬁrepower, further orbs
protect and save you lives. Although
it's fast and pretty i t leaves you
thinking you've seen it all before.
Target Renegade (Imagine) is the
sequel to the street ﬁghting beat 'em-
up Renegade in which you're out for
revenge. Your brother has been killed
by Mr. Big and you're determined to
get even, so armed with your joystick
controlled punches, leaps and kicks
you take on ﬁve levels of thugs. This
all begins in a multi-storey carpark

with a scrap with a motorbike gang
and then on through a seedy street,
park, a meeting with the Beastie Boy
fans in the shopping mall until you
have a ﬁnal battle with Mr. Big. Forget
the rules on etiquette in this game -
they ﬁght dirty. To win you'll have to
be even tougher.
Microleague Wrestling (imported
by Microprose) sets out to recreate the
thrills and spills o f American Style
wrestling and the antics of the former
world champion H u l k  Hogan.
Although two opponents are supplied
on disk and the game features digi-
tised graphics, the game is repetitive
and somewhat uninspiring. Unlike
other joystick controlled games,
Microleague Wrestling leaves you
outside the ring, occasionally selecting
a move that may succeed and then
waiting as the result is loaded in from
disk.
Activision's Corporation is set in
a world ruled by two corporations and
you lead a  mining team against a
similar team from another side. Your
task is to mine as much Minorthian
crystal as possible while hindering your
opponents operation. Despite some

game leaves you staring at the screen
for too long, to make this one worth
considering, even for dedicated fans of
strategy games. Perhaps you could use
the "free mapping grids" in a game of
battleships while the computer plays
itself!
The plot of Ocean's latest release
Gutz is certainly original as you're sent
to make contact with an approaching
alien. Unfortunately, it's an incredibly
hungry ten million tonne mega being,
the size of a small moon who promptly
eats you. Your only way out is to
destroy its major organs but ﬁrst you
will have to  survive the constant
onslaught o f  the aliens defences,
navigate through the maze of arteries,
ﬁnd suitable weapons and then destroy
each organ in turn. Sadly, Gutz falls
short of its billing, as the alien's body
looks like the setting of several other
arcade adventures and you're left with
an average arcade adventure.
Gothik (Firebird) is the latest in
a long line of Gauntlet clones in which
you must restore your master, the
supreme wizard Argoth, who has been
slain by the evil arch mage and his
body and soul dispersed in the cata-
combs you are about to explore. To

Tournament of Death
help or hinder you in your quest are
32 different potions that will tem-
porarily speed you up, slow you down,
halves damage, destroy walls in your
path and heal your wounds to name
but a few. No sooner have you drunk
your ﬁrst potion and slain your ﬁrst
shapeless monster that you're over-
come by a feeling that you've seen and
done this before.
The Tournament of Death is the
second in Infogame's Time Trouble
shooter series of games. In this game
the here Lee Enﬁeld has travelled back
to the 13th century to save the Holy
Shroud from the Yellow Shadow who
plans to destroy it. The game features
some nice graphics a n d  i s  a n
interesting arcade adventure but is
spoiled by its waggle-as-fast-as-you-
can system.

Dambusters was one of the original
"mega games" and re-enacted the
famous raids made by Guy Gibson's
Lancaster bombers. However, the
games casts you as pilot, navigator,
engineer, gunner and bomber as you
battle your way through enemy lines,
ﬂak and ﬁghter planes and into your
bombing run where your speed, height
and timing must be perfect to get the
bomb to bounce to the target.
Fight Night tests your pugilistic
prowess against ﬁve of the toughest
boxers each with their own style and
character. Joystick moves allow you
to move your guard, fake jabs and
throw punches, but watch out for some
tricky moves from your opponents
including a vicious upper cut.

Stormbringer ( Mastertronie MAD)
 is the third and concluding episode in
the superb Magic Knight trilogy con-
tinuing the adventures that began in
Spellbound and continued in Knight
Thyme. This time magic Knight is in
big trouble as he has been cloned while
transporting back in a second-hand
time machine, Now his other self, the
evil Stormbringer of the title is out to
get him. Using the now familiar, but
still impressive, windimation system
you must save the day.
Finally, a word from the "it had

budget release is in fact a compilation!

Handy Input
Routines
T
programmer to restrict a user's
input in such a way that the
input is pre-deﬁned (i.e. characters for
names, integers for telephone numbers
of a mixture o f  both fo r  postal
addresses); the maximum length of the
input is pre-deﬁned between 1 and 38
keystrokes: the tabulation on screen
is pre-deﬁned; the string variable
returned is no longer than necessary,
and even removes a space from the
end of a string if it was accidentally
included; formalises the input b y
allowing no spaces at the beginning
of the string, and only one space
between words in the string. This can
be over-ridden if you wish; the string
length is instantly available on return.
The routine is fairly short, being
only 21 lines long, and in this case
starts at line 200. To use, deﬁne the
variables RS (the restriction), L. (the
maximum string length), arid TB (the
tabulation) before calling the routine.
As regards the character restrictions
allowed, these are deﬁned between
lines 240 and 260 and can be tailored
to suit your needs, Even single key-
stroke commands can be added
(between lines 220 to 240) to increase
ﬂexibility; try adding this line.

Have you ever wondered how you could make your
Basicprograms more idiot-proof and more
professionally presented? Here's your chance with two
routines - both written in straightforward Basic with
not an SYS in sight!
By Norman Hart
A is the equivalent to LEN(YS).
Do remember after returning, that
you can always redeﬁne NI as follows:
GOSUB 2 0 0 : A S
11$=Y$
As I have already mentioned, the
SPACE character is very restricted in
how it can travel, and you may feel
that this is unsatisfactory for your
needs. I f  this is the case, then two
options are open to you. Firstly, the
shift/ SPACE i s  unaffected a n d
essentially has the same effect as an
unshiftedl SPACE as far as the visual
appearance of the string is concerned.
But be very careful! A shifted/SPACE
has a  different ASCII value to  an
unshiftedl SPACE and would most
likely cause problems if you are using
the returned string fo r searching
through data ﬁles. A  better solution
perhaps would be to erase all refer-
ences to the variable SP (i.e. delete SP
instructions in lines 200, 330, 370 &
380), or more simply, delete or REM
out line 380 only.
Cursor Controlled Menu
Now for the second routine, a little
shorter than the ﬁrst, but every bit as
useful in its own way.
The program allows the user to
select any deﬁned part of a menu by
moving a custom-designed cursor up
and down a  pre-set vertical path.
Pressing the RETURN key makes the
selection.
To use the routine you must ﬁrst
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988

deﬁne the variables — study line 360.
LL: The limit of the cursors vertical
travel. This must be set in conjunction
with an initial cursor positioning.
LN: The length of the string returned.
This is achieved by reading the screen
(OPEN 1,3) at line 580. Maximum
number of characters — 255!
The horizontal positioning of the
cursor.
T2: The horizontal start of the reading
routine (line 580).
The information returned is in the
form of a string variable Y$ and a
vertical cursor position (variable A).
The string can always be redeﬁned on
return, but perhaps more interesting,
the cursor position (variable A) can
be used to branch Out to various parts
or routines in the rest of your program,
for example:
ON A+1 GOTO 1000,2000,3000
Although the routine is fairly
straightforward, to  start with, I
strongly suggest that you type in the
program as shown in lines 240 to 330,
360 to 390, and 500 to 590. Again, take
great care with the cursor symbols in
lines 520, 540, 550, and 560, and i f
you're not happy with the > CH R$(62)
cursor, then it can be changed to any
symbol you choose.
Finally, the best way of getting to
grips with this routine is to alter the
variables at line 360 and note the
results.
See listings on page 74.

I
f, l i ke  a  great majority o f
Commodore computer owners,
you own, o r  are thinking o f
buying, a  non-Commodore printer,
you are probably already aware that
you will need some sort of interface.
Most o f  the popular makes o f
printer have w h a t i s  called a
Centronics interface built into them as
standard. It's not worth going into the
technicalities of just what a Centronics
interface is within this article, sufﬁce
to say i t  i s totally different t o
Commodore printers.
There are two ways that you can
hook up a Centronics interface. The
ﬁrst is to have a ribbon cable attached
to the user port of the computer and
the other end going to your printer.
A small piece of software has to be
loaded into the computer so that data
for the printer is sent through the user
port rather than through the normal
Commodore serial port. This is the
cheapest form of interface - however,
it is extremely limited and will not
work with a large number of programs.
The more expansive option is by
far the best. This consists of a box of
electronics th a t translates fr o m

If you thought that a printer interface was just
something that was used to send text to a printer, think
again
By Stuart Cooke
Commodore serial to Centronics. At
the Commodore end, the interface
plugs into the normal serial port. The
other end o f  the interface has a
standard Centronic plug that goes into
your printer. In use no alterations have
to be made to the computer software
since data is being sent to the normal
output socket of the computer.
With this sort of interface, as with
everything else, you get what you pay
for. The cheaper ones can he used
simply to send text to the printer. The
more expensive ones actually make
your printer behave like a standard
Commodore printer, while sti l l
allowing you to  use extra features
supported by the printer.
Xetec, an American company, has
taken things even fu rth e r a n d
produced the Super Graphics Gold
interface. They claim that i t is The
ultimate p r i n te r  interface f o r
Commodore computers'. To be totally
frank, I have to agree with them!
Gold Features
P R I N T E R S
Before I explain the intricate details
of this interface I will give a brief list
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
14
of its features. I'm sure that this will
whet the appetite of any printer owner.
• 32K RAM buffer
• 4 internal screen dumps
• 4 built in fonts
• 4 fonts can be downloaded from disk
• Bold, italics, double height etc.
Supported in all fonts
• Can use fast serial on a Cl28
• Command channel w i th  more
than 52 commands
• Commodore 1525 emulation
• Plus lots more...
As you can see the Bold interface
has a large arsenal of features inside
its box.
Getting It Ready
Before you can start to  use the
interface, y o u  need t o  give i t
information about how you want it to
work. Most of this is done through
a series of DIP switches on top of the
interface. The function o f  these is
marked on the interface as a quick
reference. One handy feature is the fact
that the switches are monitored at all
times, thus they can be altered as
required.

Switches allow you to select the
following:
The type of printer that you are using.
Settings for 37 different printers are
listed in the manual. I  found that I
could ﬁnd settings to suit all of the
printers that I tried the interface with.
The width of your printer carriage, 80
or 132.
What device number you want your
printer to use, 4 or 5.
What to do with line feeds, nothing.
add one, strip one or strip and add.
Font enable allows you to use one of
the 8 possible fonts. Switches are used
to determine the font that you wish
to use.
Enhance determines whether the
printer prints out in the quickest, but
poorish, way or the slowest but highest
quality.
The group o f three mode switches
allows you to  select just how the
interface behaves. It can:
Emulate a Commodore 1525 printer
so that all programs work correctly.
Be in Gold mode, where all features
of the interface are available.
Super graphic mode makes the
interface act like an earlier interface
from Xetec.
ASCII conversion changes all text into
their normal ASCII equivalents. Al!
other codes remain the same.
Hex Monitor prints all characters sent
to the printer as their hex equivalents.
Decimal performs the same as above
but with decimal numbers rather than
hex.
Semi-transparent passes all data
straight through the interface unless
you have turned a font on, in which
case printing will be in the selected
font.
Transparent sends everything through
to the printer unchanged. Only the
linefeed switches on the interface have
any effect on what is printed.
The Command Channel
The above is by no means everything
that can be set up within the interface.
Many other commands are sent to it
through the command channel.
The command channel is accessed
in exactly the same way as the one
in a disk drive, using a  secondary
address o f  15. Fo r  example the
following series of commands will send
a listing of the current disk directory
to the printer:
PR I N T ER S
All three screen dumps are produced using the
printer dump
OPEN # 1,4,15
PRINT 1 ," D S ”
One extremely important thing to note
with the above command is that one
issued with the command the interface
takes control of the disk drive, loads
the directory into itself and prints it
out. The computer takes no part in
this sequence and the user can continue
using it while the directory is being
printed.
Since there are over 50 different
commands that can be sent to the
printer. Obviously I can't detail them
all here, but I will list just a few:
Xn - Select international character set
F # n U s e  disk drive number n for
all downloads
QR - Print a Quick Reference of the
different secondary addresses available
DT:xxxx Download text ﬁle xxxx
from disk and print it using secondary
address 4.

DSn:xxxx Download a super font

Quite a  collection o f  powerful
facilities, as you can see. As previously
mentioned the above is only a small
selection o f the various commands
available.
Secondary Addresses
As you can see from th above list of
commands v a r i o u s  secondary
addresses are available. These are used
when opening a channel to the printer
in a command such as:
OPEN1,4,n
Where n is the secondary address. As
with the commands I will not list all
of the secondary addresses available
but just a few of them:
Samples of downloaded fonts
0 Upper case text and graphics;
I S a m e  as above with no auto-line
feeds;
2 Upper case fonts and graphics;
3 H e x  data dump:
4 Transparent.
As you can see many of the secondary
addresses have similar functions to
some o f the commands and switch
functions.
As with normal ﬁle operations you
can have more than one ﬁle open to
the printer. This means that you could
have both a transparent ﬁle and a text
ﬁle open at the same time. Useful if
you want to  use the printers own
commands and send text.

One would expect an interface that
offers so  many functions to  be
extremely difﬁcult to use. In practice
the opposite is true, Super Graphix
Gold does all of the work for you.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
16
Initial setting up of the interface to
meet yo u r requirements b u t a n
excellent manual and a  switch
monitoring program supplied on the
disk that comes with the interface
makes it fairly simple.
Being able to print out in different
fonts is extremely useful. Over 25 are
supplied on a disk with the interface
as well as programs for both the C128
and C64 that allow you to design your
own. The presence of an NLQ font
in ROM on the interface is great and
the print quality on my Star printer
is excellent. For examples of some of
the fonts, see the tables with this
article.
You have probably already realised
that the interface allows you to
perform screen dumps, though all
commands detailed so far only work
with screens on disk. One extremely
novel feature of the interface is that
it contains two screen dump programs,
that's right the interface contains them
NOT the disk supplied with it.
To L OAD  these programs into
memory you simply enter:
LOAD "LDxx",4,I for the 40 column
version and
LOAD "HDxx",4,1 for 80 columns.
The xx in the ﬁle name is used to
specify where you want the screen
dump program to reside in memory.
Verdict
There's so much more that I could tell
you about this interface, but of course
space will not allow it. As you can see
the interface certainly performs more
than any similar device on the market.
Unfortunately, its price reﬂects this
fact. Even so I  would have no
hesitation to recommend this to any
one looking for a printer interface.
Super Graphix Gold is certainly
the 'Rolls Royce' o f Commodore
printer interfaces and is a must for
anyone serious about their printer.
Should you have a  dot matrix
printer that doesn't have NLQ fonts
and you are thinking of changing your
printer because of this, Super Graphix
Gold will give you access to many more
fonts than any o f  the low priced
printers and is cheaper th i n k  about
It.

Long John Silver and men walking the plank, then think
again. For pirates have existed throughout the ages and
now it is the turn of the Federation to be infested by inter-
galactic men wearing black eye patches.
The storage depot once contained jewels, minerals,
ammunition and the very latest in battle technology, but
repeated plundering has diminished the supplies to such
extent that serious action has got to be taken.
To that end, you have been commissioned by the
ederation to destroy these latter day Henry Morgans but
they must have got wind o f your mission, for they have
managed to activate every single defence mechanism in the
depot.
Your craft, the Cybernoid is billed as The Fighting
Machine and not without good reason for you have six
different weapon systems at your ﬁngertips. Your laser is
effective only against the pirate ships, but you do have
unlimited supplies. Apart from that, it is up to you whether
to activate a few bombs, your defensive shield, Impact mines,
Seeker missiles or Bouncing bombs. These latter devices
are very much a two edged weapon as they ricochet round
the walls of the cavern as they have no means of identifying
friend from foe, and it is a poor hero who blows himself
up.
G A ME S  R E V I E W
As you shoot and destroy the pirate ships, so you can
collect whatever booty they might have been carrying.
Some carry stolen supplies, others extra weaponry which
may prove useful such as a rotating sphere that swings round
the Cybernoid destroying all it touches. There are also yellow
canisters which will add one to the supply of the weapon
system currently selected. It is up to you to pick the one
that you have fewest of - usually the shield. Picking up
the treasure is easy i f the
bottom of a screen is solid.
You just wait for gravity to
do its business. But i f the
loot falls off the bottom of
the screen, i t mysteriously
disappears between there
d the top of the next one!
The depot is in the form of a large one way maze. One
way in so much as there is only one route through it and
also, there is no backtracking. Once you enter a screen,
you cannot turn and run away.
The eventual objective is to make your way to a storage
depot and deposit whatever goodies you have managed to
over. There is a time limit though and if you don't reach
e storage area before the time limit runs out (shown by
an ever increasing graph) your ship automatically self-
destructs. Similarly, if you don't collect enough booty. All
this seems a triﬂe harsh on you when you have been
especially asked to come and help out, but then who said
life was fair anyway.
Success in Cybernoid relies more on timing than on
any great tactical strategy. Frequently the game feels more
like one of the old platform classics than a shoot 'em-up •
as you manoeuvre yourself through some of the pipes.
Control of your ship which involves countering the effects
of gravity also takes some getting used to.
Graphically, the game can be traced fairly easily back
to its Spectrum origins which may put some people off
although the effect is a lot better than some games I could
mention. There is a jolly little tune, although I suspect that
most players will soon opt for the effects only.

Gameplay itself is ﬁnely balanced and there is a deﬁnite
urge to ﬁnd out what is on the next screen. One minor
bug on my copy though, was that my number of remaining
lives counter didn't decrease when I got zapped. so I kept
ﬂying on with a false sense of security before the game
over message appeared. That apart though, Cybernoid is
a highly enjoyable, addictive shoot 'em-up.

A two pass assembler
for the Commodore 128
is very welcome
but is it a rare beast?
By Eric Doyle
, e r l i n  1 2 8  i s  t h e  o n l y
assembler that I've seen for
J th e  CI 28. An assembler is
a sophisticated program which makes
machine code programming much
easier, but you may wonder why one
is needed fo r the C128 because i t
contains a monitor already.
The monitor is very useful fo r
winging in the odd simple utility but
when it comes to serious programming
you can't beat a good assembler. The
difference is that an assembler treats
machine code programming i n  a
structured way.
The problem with a monitor is that
an omitted CLC command cannot
easily be inserted when debugging a
routine. T o  make space fo r  the
command, code has to be shifted and
memory m a n u a l l y
j u m p s r

bered. Assemblers allow the use o f
labels and line numbers. This means
that i f a CLC command has to be
added it can be done simply by adding
a line where the ('LC is needed.
Jump addresses are replaced by
labels so i f  a  routine within the
program is used for clearing part of
the screen it can be called CLR PART,
or any other name that you can devise,
and a jump to this routine would be
JMP CLR PART. When the code is
REVIEW
assembled the jump is automatically
renumbered to  point to  the new
location o f the CLRPART routine
which would have been altered by
adding the CLC command. Labels are
limited to  13 characters maximum
length, but i f a label is longer than
eight characters the listing starts to
look unwieldy. All characters in a label
must be alphanumerical; SETUP 1 is
legal but SETUP 1 would generate a
BAD LABEL error.
Merlin 128 is a  very powerful
program. Compared to any of the C64
assemblers available, it would rate as
the best laid out program so far. The
secret lies in the conﬁguration of the
Cl28 memory and its banked memory.
Merlin's own specialised disassemblerl
source c o d e  generator ca l l e d
Sourceror (sic, very sick), is stored in
Bank 1, Bank 0 is where the Merlin
code and the user's source code is
stored.
A source code is just another name
for the program listing that is currently
being worked on. When the program
is assembled (converted into proper
machine code) the code generated is
referred to as the object code.
Writing source code is as easy as
using Basic as long as machine code
commands are understood by the user.
In addition to the usual mnemonics,
the source can also contain any of the
50 special command words (pseudo
opcodes) which simplify the challenge
which coding presents. Pseudo
opeodes cover such operations as
assembling directly to disk, setting the
start address of the assembled source
code, saving and loading ﬁles,
formatting printouts and for calling up
macros.
Macros are stored on a library disk
and they are often used subroutines
which may be added to a source listing
as it is assembled and saves the user
the effort of typing in the same pieces
of code time after time. The advantage
of macros on Merlin is that labels can
be localised so i f the macro contains
a label such as LOOP and this label
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988

is already used elsewhere i n  the
program th e n  a  D U P L I C A T I
SYMBOL error will not be generated.
Macros can also use variables. I f  a
macro is written in this way:
STORE MAC
LDA )1
STA )2
it can be called by STORE # 500,SE
The value $OO would be used in th
ID A command and the value woul
be stored in SEA.

All good things come to an end and
the same is true of available RAM for
source code storage. This space is very
generous (35K) but i f  code runs
beyond this separate tiles can be linked
together for assembly.
The resultant source code can be
up to 40K and longer programs would
need to be generated through several
programs stored on disk and then
joined together through the Cl28
monitor.
The Sourceror is a  wonderful
addition which operates like an
assembler in reverse. It takes any raw
code and creates an assembly listing
which can then be properly labelled
using the search and replace facility
within Merlin. Sourceror has its own
label table which means that a code
string such as S20,SID2,SIFT which
would normally disassemble as JSR
$FFD2 would become JSR BSOUT.
If you want to add your own labels,
or to change any of Sourceror's, the
labelling ﬁl e  c a n   b e  tailored
accordingly.

The only thing I  didn't like about
Merlin was the way in which lines are
inserted into and deleted from the
source code.
All lines are numbered auto-
matically in steps of one. To insert a
line between lines 11 and 12, fo r
example, would be achieved by typing
112 followed by RETURN. The new
line is typed in (e.g. CLC) and on
pressing return the whole program is
renumbered. When I write a program
in Basic I like to start all subroutines
on a round number such as 100 or 5000
so that I  can list these parts fo r
alteration by remembering the start
addresses. With Merlin this is not
possible because o f  th e  a u to -
renumbering.
Deletion poses a linked problem.
If two areas are to be deleted, e.g. 400-
430 and 20-50, they must be removed
in this order. If lines 20-50 are deleted
ﬁrst, the auto-renumber will move
lines 400 to 430 further up the listing
to 370-400, If you don't bear this in
mind disaster could result.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988

I feel that this is the fault of the
programmers who should have looked
at the programming environment
which the user would be used to; Basic.
Then Merlin ought to  mimic this
system as far as possible to make it
user friendly.
In time the user will adapt to these
problems so i t would be wrong to
condem Merlin because of them.
The manual i s a  proﬁciently
written, spiral bound booklet o f
around 150 pages so it is impossible
to cover all of Merlin's little tricks and
treats in a review. All I can say is that
if I had bought this program blindly
I would have been delighted when I
loaded i t up at home. The Merlin
assembler is excellent and Sourceror
adds a thick and generous layer of icing
on the cake with candles!

you might have opted for,
the following programming refers to
those Routines b y the same Line
numbers so there is no confusion. I
am assuming that in your program you
will probably have two Menus to
display options. Menu I  would
probably be something like:
Program M e n u
I Create F i l e
2 Enter F i l e
3 See Director
4 Exit Program
Both the ﬁrst two options will take
you eventually to a second menu - the

something like this:
File M e n u
I Enter Records
2 Browse Records
3 Search Records
4 Print Template
5 Change Keyﬁeld
6 Sort R e c o r d s
7 Sequent'al L i s t
8 Exit P r o g r a m
P R O G R A M M I N G
This is only a suggestion of course.
You might have other ideas! I f  you
have programmed correctly, you will
be able to  use the routines I  have
already given for setting up a File and
Entering RECORDS into i t. The
following routine is a  suggested
-
be able to scan the RECORDs, amend
them, copy them or print them out.
In the next article in the series I
will suggest a sort and search which
will ﬁnd any RECORD fro m a
KeyFIELD in a ﬁle of 3,000 in less
than 9 RECORD reads! However, that
subject requires an article of its own,
so you will have to wait!
The following routines work i n
either BASIC 2  and BASIC 3.5+,
except where I show different. The ﬁrst
routine we need is the one which will
separate the DISKS read from the
RECORD into the correct FIELDs.
The routine is itself quite easy:
4170 rem **** read RECORDs into
ﬁelds
4180 forar-Otoc: dispS(a)zmidS
(cliskS,fpoi (a), ﬁeld (a)) :nexta

In the last two articles of this series, Routines were
explained, which would set up, create and hous,,eep a
relative ﬁle. Now we go on to a method of usi. g the
records that have been created, and displaying them in
the most efﬁcient way
By Eric Ramsay
and the FIE L D  Pointers Array,
FP01() into the String Array DISPS(1.
You w i l l  have t o  remember t o
DIMension this Array in the beginning
of your program. Among the other
items you might have. Line 10 should
have:
10 dim dispS(C):rem*** where c=no
of FIELDs
If you have elected to use the FIELD
Separation method Read into the
Array (which I have mentioned in part
two) this has already been done, and
you w o u l d  e n te r t h e  D i sp l a y
subroutine at Line 4300. Now we will
look at the Display Routine:
4300 print "Record No:"disp;" of" ;rn;
4310 for a=0toc
4340 printtab(?)a+ I tab(?);ﬁeldS(a);tab(?);
disp S(a)
4350 nexta:return
There are a  few lines missing but
leave these spaces because there
are several functions that need to be
used here that we have not reached
in the series yet, The DISP Variable
is the current RECORD Number used
in the Browse Routine. R N  is the
Variable you should remember from

is the
,r from

of RECORDs current in the ﬁle. I have
placed a ? in the TAB Statements
because I use 80 columns and those
of you with BASIC 2  will need
different numbers there, which is really
a question of preference.
You may have noticed that at no
stage have we entered any details of
the FIELDnames into the RECORD.
Well, of course the FIELDnames are
constants and n o t  p a rt o f  th e
RECORD data, so including them
inside the RECORD, a s I  saw
suggested i n  a  recent article from
another magazine, is utter nonsense:
including FIELDnames inside the
RECORD merely wastes precious
Bytes. Imagine using ﬁfteen FIELDs
with each FIEL D n a me  o f  1 0
characters: this would use 150 Bytes
of the 254 available!
Above, you can see how we display
the FIELDname together with the
data from the RECORD, by using the
FIELDS Array beside the DISPS.
Browse Routine
I have used a Secondary Browse Menu
on the Display RECORD screen, from
which a single Keypress can command
the Display to change. You might wish
to do it differently. First we OPEN
the File. BASIC 3.5+
2680 dopen 5,(nameS), dO, u8:
gosub3610
Or BASIC 2: (Command Channel
already opened)
2680 open 5,8,5,nameS:gosub3610
Then the screen is cleared:
2690 scnclr
Now we declare to  Variables; the
BEGinning RECORD number to
browse, and the FINish number. We
set the BEGinning to I, naturally, and
the EINishing to the RECORDs used
counter RN. This ensures that the
program does not ask for a  non-
existant RECORD Number.
2700 print "Browse";
2710 gosub 4210
I use the same Limit Routine from
several different parts of the program,
so I usually GOSUB to this Routine.
This enables the user to select the
RECORD Numbers he wishes to
Browse between, as well as List and
various other functions. Here is the
Limit Routine:
4200 r e m  * * * *  l i m i t  Routine
*********
4210 beg=1:ﬁn=rn:print "within Limits
P R O G R A M M I N G
(y/ n)?"
4220 getkeyyyS:ifyyS="n" th e n
disp=beg: return
4230 print "Begin at Record No": input
nS:n=val(nS)
4240 beg=n:disp=beg
4250 print "End a t Record No":
inputS:n=val (nS)
4260 if n < beg orn > rn then ﬁn=rmelse
ﬁn=n
4270 return
This routine makes several checks
before it continues. It ensures that the
beginning is I and the ﬁnish is the last
RECORD Number. Then if the user
wishes to begin at a higher number
than I, Line 4240 declares that and
sets the DISPlay Variable to the new
BEGinning number. Then the FINish
Variable is IN PUTted, and a check is
made in Line 4260 that the FINish
number is neither less than the
BEGinning number nor greater than
the RECORD existing on the File.
If either is the case then FIN is set
to the last RECORD number, RN,
otherwise FIN is the requested Last
RECORD number in the Browse. The
program then RETURNs to  the
Browse Routine.
I window the following Browse
Menu on my 80 column screen, but
you may have your own preference,
depending on your screen size. The
Menu shows:
2720: r e m  display menu
2730 print"Search Goto First Last

2740 rrec=disp rem **** get RECORD

2740 rem for BASIC 2 rp=disp:gosub

RECORD
2770:
2780 getkeyaaS:aa=instr ("sgﬁnbec-
pdm", aaS):ifaa < Ithen2780
You should be able to follow that. The
Routines are all there to do the job.
BASIC 2 users, of course, do not have
the INSTR function which makes a
search of a String within another. You
can do the same thing this way:
2780 getaaS:ifaa.S="" then 2780
2780 fors= I to I I
2782 ifaaS=midS('sgﬁnbecpdm",s, I)
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
23
then aa=s:s=1 I: go to 2790
2784 next s
Having selected the Routine from the
ﬁrst letter of the function from the
Browse Menu, the program then
branches to the appropriate Routine:
2790 on aa goto 3030,2900.2800,
2810,2820, 2830, 2940,3140,3200,
3290,2840
The remainder of this Routine is quite
straightforward. The DISP Variable is
altered according to  the different
Routines which processes it:
2800 dispzbeg:goto 2740: rem **** go
to ﬁrst RECORD
2810 disp=ﬁn:goto 2740: rem **** go
to last RECORD
2820 disp=disp+1:goto 2860:rem
next RECORD
2830 disp=disp-1:goto 2860:rem
previous
2840 dclose: REM place update counter
here to save hleeping
2850 goto290: rem **** return to menu
2
*
Here I  have caused the Display to
'wrap around' if a 'Next' is requested
at the end of the ﬁle or a Previous'
is requested at the start of the ﬁle then
the DISP Variable is altered to the
start or end number:
2860 if disp< ﬁn then disp=beg: rem
**** wrap around
2870 ifdisp < beg then disp=ﬁn:rem
**** effect with display
Now t h e  R E C O R D  N u m b e r
processing is ﬁnished and the Line
2880 returns the Routine to display the
next RECORD:
2880 goto2740
Now I can outline some other Routines
also used by the Browse Menu. As I
mentioned before, the Search Routine
must wait for its own article, as must
the Delete Routines, but the above
Routine has only covered the ﬁrst, last,
next, back and menu options on the
ﬁle menu: there is still copy, amend
and print routines to  come. They
follow the end of the Display Routines.
The ﬁrst is the 'Goto' Routine:
2890 rem * * * *  additional display
routines
2900 print "Enter Record N o  to
'Goto' "
2910 getkey nS:n=val (nSS):if n b e g
or n -

then p r i n t  " F i l e  L i m i t
Exceeded:":goto2910
BASIC 2 owners do not forget to
change the Getkey command in Line
2910.
2920 dispzn:goto2740
Next is the RECORD Edit or Amend
Routine. It is a good idea to have an
Edit Counter to turn on if this option
is used which would direct a save of
the Housekeeping on exit from the
program. I used a poke to a speciﬁc
location i n  R A M , but a  Variable
would do just as well: xx will do.
Incidentally, with the number of
times that the program requests
INPUT from the keyboard, you might
consider a separate INPUT Routine
to which you could GOSUB whenever
you need the keyboard. The one I used
I shall give you now to save me re-
typing the Getkey over and over. Yes,
BASIC 2, I  shall write one for you
as well. Here it is:
3420 rem n u m b e r  input routine
3430 open 1,0:input # I,nS:closel :
n =val (nS)
3440 if n 1  then 3430
3450 return
As you can see, a ﬁle is OPENed to
the keyboard so that horrible ? is
avoided. Numerical data is accepted
into the String NS and VALued in the
Variable N to prevent a program error
in the event of some idiot pressing a
non-numeric key. Line 3440 checks for
that and then 3450 RETURNs the
Routine. Now to continue with the rest
of Routines:
2930 rem * * * *  edit mode Routine
**********
2940 xx=1:printer "Enter FIELD No
to Edit?"
Get Fieldnumber to Edit:
2950 gosub3430:n=n-1:ifn < 0 or n c
then 2940
Re-write the FIEL D  contained i n
DispS(n)
2960 i n p u t  fsS:dispS(n)=IeftS
( f s S i
2965 scnclr:gosub 4300
2970 print"Edit Another FIELD ? (y/
n)":get key yyS
2980 ifyySy"then 2940
Re-collect the String DISKS with the
new Field:
2990 diskS="":for a=0tocidiskS
P R O G R A M M I N G
=diskS+IsS:nexta
Declare the RECORD Number and
GOSUB to  the Write RECORD
Routine:
3000 wrec=disp:gosub 4070
3000 (for BASIC 2 -  rp=disp:gosub
4114:gosub4070
Then go back to the beginning of the
Display Routine:
3010 goto 2740
If you have chosen the FIE L D
Separated method then you must add
a CHRS( 13) to the Collection String,
Line 2990:
2990 diskS="":fora=0toc:diskS=diskS
1
but otherwise the Routine is exactly
the same. BASIC 2 users do not forget
the change in Line 3000.
Copy Routine
It is useful to have a facility to copy
an existing RECORD into a new one,
to alter it to make a unique one. If
you need several RECOR Ds which are
almost identical then you need to write
just one then copy it several times and
make the changes to the new ones. This
can save some typing! Since we are
making a  N e w  R EC OR D , w e
increment the RECORD counter, RN,
and declare the Write RECORD
Variable WREC as the RECORD
number to write to, naturally since the
new RECORD is to be created at the
end of the File:
3130 re m * * * * *  Copy Routine
**********
3140 xx=1:rn=rirtl:wrec=rn
3140 ( f o r  B A S I C  2 )
xx=1:rn=rn-I-1:rp=rn
It's as simple as that, except for BASIC
2 owners who will have to make a
minor change. We have already Read
the RECORD and have the DISKS
all ready in Variable memory. Even
the Fields Separated method users
have the DISPS Array, but they have
to add a Line:
3145 diskS=":fora=0toc:diskS=
d i s k S i
_because they have not used the Read
in one or three method. Now all users
have the Collect String ready we can
continue. W e  simply w ri te  th e

RECORD with:
3160 gosub4070:rem *** write copied
RECORD
However, a little more work needs to
be done. We are still in the Browse
mode, and the program w i l l  be
confused by this sudden appearance
of a new number. So we reset the
DISPlay and the FINish Variables and
then we can return to the beginning
of the Display Routine. The new
RECORD will now be read again from
the File and displayed:
3170 disp=rn:ﬁn=ﬁn+ I
3180 goto 2740
Hardcopy Routine
If you have a printer it is always useful
to be able to press a key and receive
a hardcopy of a RECORD. This is the
Print routine. If you have programmed
for a Printer before it should be easy
to follow:
3190 rem **** single printout Routine

Notice the Secondary Address 7 in the
Printer OPEN Line. This is to print
in Lower Case, since I assume you will
want this. If not omit the '7', on the

voiding the worries of leaving
the Commodore coral o f
printers can mean trading
away the added power of a wider range
of facilities for convenience. You don't
have to be a technological whizz to
be a bit more adventurous, but a little
background knowledge helps to avoid
the pitfalls which gape for the unwary.
For most people, a printer means
a dot matrix model. This type gives
a wide range of possibilities beyond
normal typewritten characters, A good
printer will allow user deﬁnition of
characters and high resolution image
printouts.
Any Storm in a Port?
The standard Commodore printer
communication is performed through
the serial port. This is probably the
slowest way of shunting data around
and most other computer systems
—
difference between the two methods
lies in the way in which the data is
formatted for transfer.
Imagine a  small factory with
conveyor belts transferring items from
one place t o another. A  serial
communication factory would have
just one conveyor belt carrying a single
item of data (a bit). In a parallel factory
eight synchronised belts would be used
to carry each bit of a byte to the output
at the same time (i.e. in parallel), The
net effect is that the parallel system
is approximately eight times faster
than serial.
For Commodore owners the choice
is limited to the serial system but if
a parallel printer is chosen, there are
two optional ways in which the printer
can be connected. One is to use a
parallel cable to connect the printer
directly t o  the  user port. The
alternative is to connect to the serial
port through a suitable interface which
recombines the bits into a parallel byte
suitable for the printer input. Both
systems have their strengths and
weaknesses.
The user port parallel connector
needs special software to send the
information in a  format which the
printer understands. This means a loss
of memory space in which the driver
is stored. The obvious problem is that
some software will not allow such a
system to run alongside itself and the
printer can be rendered inaccessible.
Fortunately, many of  the better
packages contain their own drivers but

In their inﬁnite wisdom and because
of their desire to maximise on the
graphics capabilities o f  t h e i r
computers, Commodore devised a
special version of ASCII codes way
back i n  the PET days. ASC II a
standardised system for data transfer
between machines so, b y messing
around w i th  their o w n  system,
Commodore have complicated comm-
unications through the need fo r
TETSCII to ASCII converter.
Nearly all printers use ASCII so
the software for a user port link-up
must have a conversion table, more
memory eaten up. Once again the
serial interface wins out because the
job can be done outside the computer.
Not only can an interface convert to
ASCII but it can normally be switched
to pass data without interference in
transparent mode. This is useful when
all of the necessary conversions are
made through application software
running on the computer.
Another beneﬁt o f  using a n
interface is that the transparent switch
is often accompanied by other switches
some of which duplicate the functions
of some of the internal switches inside
the printer. If you're now asking how
switch duplication is beneﬁcial, you've
obviously had limited experience o f
printers and the ﬁendish methods that
the manufacturers employ to make
these wretched facilties virtually
inaccessible.
Three o r more switches enable
quelling to the most common manu-
facturers makes, but other switches
can add extra linefeeds, change the
device number to either four or ﬁve
and often there is a hex dump mode.
The ﬁnal mode is especially useful
when printer communication gives
unexpected
the codes as commands, the interface
converts every piece of data into hexa-
decimal numbers so that the sequences
can b e  seen and analysed f o r
debugging.
when these are not in use, the user has
the hassle of loading their own special
program which, as we shall see, can
be relatively lengthy.
Life is simpler with a serial port
interface though the beneﬁt of fast data
transfer is sacriﬁced for this ease of
use. Within the interface is all of the
necessary software and hardware to
convert the serial signal into parallel.
Code Crossover
PR I N T ER S
Boot up the RS-232
Until now the assumption has been
that the printer is of the Centronics
type. The user port is also referred to
as the RS-232 port and RS-232 means
modem links, doesn't it? Not really,
RS-232 is yet another standard for
communication between devices and
some printers, though few in number,
still adhere to this system.
The name RS-232 applied to the
user port is a bit of a misnoma because
the true convention is to use a D-type
connector with a computer originated
voltage line of -I2V to I2V. The user
port is a simple edge connector with
a supply voltage o f 0 to 5V. Why
Commodore insists on veering away
from the accepted speciﬁcations for
data interchange can only be seen as
a marketing ploy to encourage sales
of their own branded peripherals.
Several companies now supply RS-
232 converters which plug into either
the user or the cartridge ports and
perform the necessary conversion of
the voltage range and terminate in a
suitable D-type plug or socket.
Connecting an RS-232 printer
poses the same software problems
created b y  Centronics c a b l e
connection. Special drivers must be
stored i n  R A M  and commercial
software must cater fo r  RS-232
outputs.
Each method of connection has its
advantages a n d  disadvantages.
Centronics cables are b y fa r the
cheapest method o f connection but
inhibited b y  the need fo r  driver
software. At around DO, the RS-232
interface is quite expensive, requires
driver software but has the advantage
that it can be used both as a printer
or modem interface. Since it is never
essential to have both a modem and
a printer connected at the same time,
the dual facility can be used to stretch
a limited budget because a  good
second-hand R S - 2 3 2  p r i n t e r
frequently costs less than an equivalent
Centronics machine.
My own choice would be a reliable
Centronics interface. These start
upwards of £40, but the facilities that
they offer are far more extensive, more
convenient and use none o f  the
precious computer RAM. Although I
have made mention of the slower data
transfer speeds, these don't really affect
a printer greatly unless a data buffer
is used printer mechanisms are often
slow enough to mask the serial speeds.
YOUR COMMODORE juts

About Face
One o f the greatest beneﬁts that a
Centronics interface can offer is a
range of extra typefaces to supplement
the range within the printer itself. Not
all interfaces offer this facility, but it's
worth hunting one down if quality or
presentation is important to you.
On the other hand, it may by that
high resolution screendumps , are
important. The problem is that colours
cannot easily be represented o n  a
printer. Some interfaces provide this*
facility and may even offer the option
for full page sized dumps or smaller
quarter page printouts.
The availability of both of these
functions only applies to printers with
user deﬁnable character capabilities,
but these days few do not offer this.
Designing yo u r o w n  characters
requires complex commands and
ingenuity so why tax your brain when
someone else has already done it for
you!
Another desirable feature is a
printer buffer. These can be part of
an interface or printer, or high capacity
buffers can be bought as separate
units. If you use your printer heavily
for wordprocessing or database and
spreadsheet printouts, a buffer can be
worth its weight in gold for the time
savings offered.
Software hangs up while printing
takes place and the shorter the time
that a printout takes, the sooner you
can get back to productive use of a
printer. I've just mentioned that
printers convert data to the printer
form much more slowly than the data
is passed from the computer, so a
buffer acts as a kind of external RAM
store.
With a buffer in use the data is
thrown out of the computer at a high
rate and the buffer ﬁlls u p  with
characters waiting for the printer to
get round to using it. If a document
occupies 3Kb of memory, a 3K buffer
will ﬁll up almost instantaneously and
fool the computer into thinking that
the printer has ﬁnished. When control
is handed back to the user, the next
document can be written, loaded or
otherwise processed without inter-
facing with the printer clacking its way
through the buffer contents at its own
pace. This often saves several minutes
and negates the need to amuse yourself
by beverage brewing, contemplating
the nature and source of naval ﬂuff,
or looking fo r brush hairs i n the
paintwork!

Printing by Numbers
-
Commodore types, Epson compatibles
and those which ﬁt neither of these
descriptions! The best facilities are
always th o s e  o f  t h e  E p s o n
compatibles, principally Epson, Star
and Citizen. Precision Software also
have an Epson style printer with a
novel multipole head system for high
speed printouts.
All software will drive an Epson-
style printer and the facilities offered
are always streets ahead o f  any
Commodore machine.
Access to  these special facilities
such as near letter quality printing,
various styles and sizes of print face
and page formatting commands is
achieved by special codes. To a printer
all data is just a series of numbers but
one number is special - 27. If this value
is received the printers operating
system will not print out this or any
numbers which follow according to a
ﬁxed set of parameters. For example,
a character string which takes the form
of CHRS(27) followed by CH RS(70
will set the printer into emphasised
print mode. Any numbers following
this command will be printed out as
an emphasised form of their ASCII
equivalent until another CHRS(27)
command is met.
Without a n  interface so me
character values such as CHRS(18)
which would set a Commodore printer
into reverse character mode (RVS ON)
won't affect Epson printer in the same
way. CHRS(18) on an Epson is the
character used to  cancel condensed
printing mode, and this is one of the
reasons why an interface is essential.
Many makes of printer now come
with an optional Commodore inter-
face built into them which makes them
an excellent choice. Extra typefaces
and print modes can be readily
accessed a n d  compatibility i s
guaranteed.
All is not lost with Commodore
printers; the 801 has many o f the
essential features o f  a n  Epson
compatible but often the quality of the
letters produced i s inferior. Tw o
companies c u r r e n tl y  p r o d u c e
replacement chips which will extend
and improve the range of typefaces
available and this could be a worth-
while upgrade for owners o f these
machines.
Dodging the Dots
Non-matrix printers include daisy-
PR I N T ER S
wheels, ink-jet and laser machines. All
are more expensive than dot matrix
machines and pose special problems.
Daisywheel printers produce
excellent quality printouts and various
typefaces can be added by swapping
wheels of different types. The draw-
backs with a daisywheel is that printing
is much slower and graphics dumps
are impossible. The advantage is that
an interface does not have to be very
sophisticated, so a cheap Centronics
unit stripped of all the graphics bells
and whistles can be used.
Ink-jet printers, include limited
colour capabilities and laser printers
offer high quality printouts which are
virtually indistinguishable from a
typeset magazine page. The bad news
is that the necessary drivers for these
machines have not ﬁltered down to
Commodore level and software is non-
existant.
One type of printer which I've not
YOUR COMMOIME .
mentioned is the plotter. Commodore
used to produce an inexpensive four-
colour plotter, VIC 1520, but I haven't
seen any around the shops during the
past year. These were excellent little
machines which produced quite a high
quality printout but the pens could dry
Out very quickly and the maximum
paper width was only six inches.
If you need a plotter the Toshiba
H X-P570 i s an excellent choice.
Although this machine was designed
for use with MSX computers I have
found th a t i t  works adequately
through a Centronics interface. The
big advantage of the Toshiba is that
it can take A4 sized paper but the pens
are the same as the ones used by the
1520.

Learn how to chat up your
peripherals without fear of prejudice
By Norman Doyle
T
anything which is not inside the
computer. Obviously any disk
drives, cassette recorders and printers
and modems are all peripherals but the
keyboard and monitor, or TV screen,
are also classed as peripherals.
So that the computer knows what
to communicate with, each peripheral
is given a number which deﬁnes its
address in Peripheral Street. Just as
in Downing Street where number 10
is always the Prime Minister and
number II is the Chancellor, some of
the addresses on Peripheral Street are
reserved fo r particular occupations.
Number 1 0  Downing Street i s
currently occupied b y  Margaret
Thatcher but i t could equally have
been Neil Kinnock — the maker's name
doesn't matter but the job's the same.
Addressing a  communique to  10
Downing Street will mean that the
Prime Minister will receive i t fo r
BEGINNERS
processing, whoever that person may
be.
Similarly, number 1 Peripheral
Street i s always occupied b y the
cassette recorder which may or may
not be called a Commodore but which
will be a load and save device which
uses a tape. Number two is a modem
or RS-232 device, number three is the
screen, number four and ﬁve are each
reserved for a printer and 8  to I I
reserves space fo r  other storage/
retrieval systems such as disk drives,
hard disks, wafer drives or anything
else that may have been dreamed up.
The keyboard occupies a special
address. In  Commodoreland streets
are numbered from zero upwards so
the keyboard resides at number O.
From switching on the power,
several hotlines are set up which
directly communicate with speciﬁc

mation directly from the user, the
screen is set as the output device and
the program storage! retrieval system
is set to address number I, the cassette
recorder.
These are called th e  default
settings, that is the normal heirarchy
for communication. If another device
is to be addressed it can be achieved
in one of two ways depending on the
channel.
Disk drives are selected for a single
operation by tagging a ',8' (or 8,1) to
the end o f  the equivalent cassette
command. When the function is
complete, control lines for input and
output are passed back to the screen
and the keyboard. If you want to test
the verity of this form of command,
try saving a program with 1  when
a printer is attached. You'll get
response but nothing particularly
meaningful.

treated as a ﬁle saving store. This is
true of the printer and a ﬁle must be
opened and printed too but no ﬁle
name is necessary. You could use
OPEN 4,4,7, "progname,S,W" and
then PRINT # commands but the
result would just print the string (the
characters in quotes) before printing
out the PRINT # statements,
The convention is that OPEN 3,4
is used. The leading 3 is an arbitrary
value which denotes which o f  the
computers 256 communication lines
will be used and could therefore be
any number from one to 255. The
signiﬁcant digit is the second 4 which
means 'talk to the printer'. Sometimes
this command is supplemented in the
form OPEN 4,4, x  where x  is a
secondary command which sets the
printer or interface into a speciﬁc mode
such as lower case character enable,
After opening the ﬁle one of two
commands can be issued. PRINT 3
will print whatever follows it directly
to the printer assuming that the OPEN
command i s OPEN  3,4, I f  this
command has been OPEN 4,4 the
corresponding command would be
PRINT 4 .

The second form of command is
CMD3. This is used primarily to
execute a  L IST command so that
programs can be listed out i n  the
correct form.
OPEN4,4:CMD4:LIST
To redirect the CPU to its default
devices either of the above commands
should be terminated by closing the
ﬁle before anything else is done using
CLOSEI
When talking to the disk drive the
same rules apply but the OPEN
command uses OPEN channel (0-
255),8. Care should be taken because
a secondary command of 15 serves a
special function. This is the command
mode and the specialist orders such
as format, rename and scratch are sent
to any channel opened in this way:
Then a PRINT # command will
have to follow one o f the speciﬁed
syntaxes for a command otherwise an
error will be generated. Using a
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
31
secondary command o f  15 is like
saying to  the drive 'let's use your
special Basic language'.
So ﬁles are opened using the
following syntax, bearing in mind the
type o f  device which i s  being
addressed:
OPEN channel,device n u mb e r,
secondary address, "command"
For fun try these tests:
OPEN2,3:PRINT# 3 ,"H E L L O
WORLD":CLOSE2
Now load a  program and then type
in:
OPEN2,3:CMD3:LIST
After the cursor reappears type and
enter CLOSE2.
As you can see all peripherals are
broadly the same and the screen is a
good way to practice some of the ﬁle
commands. There's nothing to fear
because they're all just small variations

his program should work with
any printer with a Centronics
(i.e. parallel) interface. The
software listed enables you to pretend
that your printer is a real Commodore
printer connected to the serial bus. Of
course Commodore graphics symbols
won't be reproduced, but the system
is ﬁne for program listings in BASIC
and assembly language (such as from
the Commodore disk-based assembler
package) and for word processing.
The interface consists of just one
piece o f  10-way ri b b o n  cable
connected between the C64's user port
and the printer parallel interface.
Anyone w i th  minimal soldering
experience could make up this lead.
Suitable connectors are available by
mail order from companies such as
Maplin Electronic Supplies Ltd. For
my printer I needed a 25-way D-type
connector. What you need to do is dig
out where the connections for DATAO
to DATA6 (7 bits), DATA STROBE,
BUSY and GROUND are from your
printer manual, and then wire up the
connecting cable in the following way:
C64 user port pin
(bottom row)

The user port connections are all
on the bottom edge - pin N is the right-
hand end looking from the back o f
the CM. All the above connections are
to adjacent pins.
The driver software is a small block
of machine code occupying memory
locations SCROO-SCBCF (hex). Once
installed it is transparent to the user
(provided your program doesn't over-
write it -  which it is unlikely to do
because this is about the safest area
of memory in my experience).

YOUR COMMODORE july 1988

To output Commodore format
assembly listings to the printer, just
answer 'Y' to the relevant question
when the assembler is run, after having
enabled the printer software with SYS
51968.
You can leave the printer software
resident as long as you like -  it will
only be used when you have a printer
ﬁle open. However, i f you want to
totally deactivate the routine type SYS
51971.
Various options are available when
the print routine is activated.
When initialised with SYS 51968,
the system is conﬁgured for a 66 line
page, printing 60 lines and leaving six
blank automatically. A l l  control
characters are ignored, except fo r -
RETURN. There is no left margin
indentation after each RETURN, and
the system reckons it's at the top of
a page. This can be changed:
POKE 52223,225 says don't ignore
control characters - useful for setting
printer to funny mode.
POKE 52223,0 says revert to ignoring
control characters (default). Use this
mode for listings.
POKE 52222,x (defaultvalue 0) sets
an indentation o f  x  chrs a t the
beginning of each line useful when
printing listings to be ring-bound etc.
POKE 52221,x (default value 60) sets
number of printing lines per page, plus
6 blank lines. If you don't want paging,
do POKE 52221,0, D o  this when
listing assembly language with the
Commodore disk assembler, as it does
its own paging.
?PEEK(52220) gives the current line
number on the printing page -  do
POKE 52220,1 to tell the system you
are at the top of a page.
The program is listed as a BASIC
loader, containing checksums to point
out typing errors. Type this in, save
it, run it, and i f there are no errors
you can enable the printer driver with
SYS 51968, as described before.
To sum up, if all you require out
of a  printer i s program listing
capability and straight text output, this
is a cheap way of doing i t i f  you
have access to  a  parallel printer.M

How many cassettes must
other commodore users
have? Lots methinks! So
have come up with a
program to neaten up
cassette collections which
can also he used to tidy up
your normal audio
cassettes
By Mick Walpole
nitially, you will be greeted with
the program title, a representation
,A o f the insert card and the menu.
Now select the cassette you wish to
create and insert for, and follow the
steps below:
• Option 1 -  th e  screen will clear,
reprint the insert mimic, highlight the
area being worked on in BLACK and
request the cassette number. (This
should be a number between I and 99).
When Return is pressed the menu will
be displayed again.
• Option 2  -  the screen will clear,
reprint the insert mimic, highlight the
area being worked on in BLACK and
request the cassette name. (This should
be a  string o f  no more than 23
characters in length, there is an error
trap here.) When the Return i s
depressed the menu will be displayed
again.
• Option 3  -  the screen will clear,
reprint the insert mimic, highlight the
area being worked on in BLACK and
request the details for Side A. (Up to
24 characters.) When the Return key
is pressed you will be asked for the
second input, and so on up to the
maximum of 9 after which the menu
will be displayed again.
• Option 4 - repeat the third step for
Side B.
• Option 5 - you will be asked i f you
have entered all detail required. Switch
on printer and if all is OK press Y.
The printer will now print out the
insert card and return to the menu
ready for the next cassette.
All you need to do now is cut it
out and fold it. NB. Because of the
use of graphics characters and double
sue characters this program will only
work on Commodore printers. But
with a little modiﬁcation, should work
on any dot matrix printer.

compositions are quite amazing particularly the double
tempo remix of Greensleeves featuring a synthesiser, guitar
and a ﬂute!
Once you have a tune in memory you can have great
fun editing it either by copying sections to make it longer,
if not repetitive, or you can change the tempo to make
it faster or slower or swap one of the three instruments
for another, selected from a pull down menu. Most of the
twelve instruments supplied with the program do sound
quite reasonable given the tinny quality of C64 music. This
can of course be improved by playing Instant Music through
a MIDI system but I doubt my creations warrant the extra
expense. However the drum sound is awful and sounds
more like someone clearing his throat. In fact I doubt even
if Messers Stock, Aitkin and Waterman would use it on
one of their "hits". Luckily, all is not lost as you can load
in a separate synthesiser program through which you can
adjust attack and release times, the rate, depth and ratio
of pulses, modify modulations and add in triangle, sawtooth
and pulse waves to create the sound that you've always
been looking for.
Instant Musicians will ﬁnd many uses for such a program
ranging from demonstrations to answer the old "what can
you do with a computer" questions through fun jamming
sessions to trying out new phrases before inﬂicting them
on your musical colleagues.
Jamming couldn't be easier as the program worries about
hitting the right note, in the right tempo leaving you to
select an instrument and move a joystick to add that ﬁnishing
touch.

PRINTERS
If the phrase "Escape Code"
brings you out in a cold sweat,
and the prospect of selecting
the quadruple- density graphics mode
on your ﬂash new printer is
enough to bring you to your knees,
then EasiPrint is the
program for you.
By Mark Everingham
asiprint
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
37
F
asiPrint is an extension to the
normal B A S I C  operating
s y s t e m whichprovidestheuser
with 60 (yes, I  did say 60) extra
commands, expressly for the purpose
of controlling a  dot-matrix printer
linked to the Commodore serial port.
The program will work on any
printer conforming to  the Epson
Standard, which is used by almost
every type of dot-matrix printer. Of
course, the large exception to this is
Commodore's own range of printers.
Therefore, extra commands have been
added to operate either the MPS801
or MPS803 printers. The Epson
commands included in EasiPrint cover
every function imaginable fr o m
selecting the compressed printing
mode, to  disabling the paper-out
sensor.
Of course, since all these functions
are controlled by the printer itself, i f
your printer will not print double
height for example, then EasiPrint
won't either!
Using EasiPrint Commands
Each o f EasiPrint's commands are
preceded by an asterisk to distinguish
them fr o m  th e  normal B A S IC
commands. When using them in a
program, no other command can
follow an EasiPrint command. The
command must either be the only
command in that line, or the last one
in the line. For example:
10 *NLQ ON:SCNCLR
will turn Near Letter Quality printing
on, but will NOT clear the screen.
However:
10 SCNCLR:*NLQ ON
will clear the screen and then turn Near
Letter Quality printing on.
When you are using an EasiPrint
command in the BASIC Direct Mode
(without a  line-number), you must
precede the command with a colon to
make the interpreter execute the
command as i f  i t were part o f  a
program. For example:

*NLQ ON
from Direct Mo d e  w i l l  give a
"?SYNTAX ERROR" report, but
:*NLQ ON
will do the trick (Turning NLQ on).
Command Syntax
All EasiPrint commands fall into one
of the following three categories:
• They require no input parameter e.g.
*PICA and *ELITE
• They re q u i re  a n  O N / O F F
parameter e .g . * I T A L I C  a n d
*UNDERLINE.
• They require a numeric parameter
e.g. * L E F T M A R G I N  a n d
*CHARACTERSET.
Note that for type (2) commands,
you must put a space between the
command a n d  t h e  O N  OFF
parameter, but if you wish to save on
RAM, you can leave out the OFF
leaving the effect unchanged.
For type (3) commands, the input
parameter is either a number in the
range 0-255 (Byte parameters) or in
the range 0-65535 (16-Bit parameters).
The range required is indicated i n
"EasiPrint commands".
If the parameter speciﬁed is of the
wrong type, o r is outside the valid
range, then a suitable BASIC error
message will be displayed and program
execution stopped as for all BASIC
commands.
EasiPrint Commands
Commands requiring no parameters
DISABLE - is used to disable the Easi-
Print commands in case of software
incompatibility, etc. To re-enable the
program you can use SYS 32757. (See
"Patching-in the System.")
TEST -  will send a textual message
to the printer in order to test that it
is functioning properly.
SOCRATES - ﬁnd out for yourself!
PICA - selects the Pica printing pitch
on your printer. Pica is the standard
point-size which is selected when a
PRINTERS
printer is ﬁrst switched on.
ELITE - selects the Elite pitch on your
printer. Elite is a narrower, more dense
print-style providing 112 characters
per line instead of the usual 80.
RESET - sends the control codes to
the printer for a reset. This has the
result of selecting the Pica pitch with
all the special effects turned off, and
resetting the default page size and
margin settings, etc.
RETURN -  sends the code for a
carriage return to the printer.
LINEFEED -  sends the code for a
linefeed to the printer.
SPACE1/ 6 - sets the line spacing of
the printer to one sixth o f an inch
which is the standard setting.
SPACEL 8 - similar to the SPACE1/
6 command, but sets spacing to one
eighth of an inch.
SPACE7/ 72 - sets line spacing to 7/
72 inches. This value is the same as
used fo r  drawing continous line
(Epson) o r  Commodore graphics
characters, and is the setting used when
the graphics modes are in action.
FOR METED -  sends a  formfeed
character to the printer which has the
effect of moving the paper position
onto the next sheet.
TAB - moves the printer's head to the
next tab position across the line.
Ofﬁcially, this is called an HTAB (See
SETHTABS.)
VERTICALTAB mo ve s the paper
forward t o  the next vertical tab
position (ofﬁcially VTAB). (See
SETVTABS.)
CAN CELINE - will delete the last line
from the printer's buffer. Note that it
will only work i f  a carriage-return
character has not been sent.
ONLINE - sets the printer on-line for
printing, etc.
OFFLINE -  sets the printer off-line
for moving the paper, changing
ribbon, etc.
EXPANDED - selects the expanded
printing effect o n  a  Commodore
compatible p r i n t e r .  A n o t h e r
command is supplied for doing this on
a non-Commodore printer. Note that
if this command is sent while the
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
38
printer is in bit-image mode, then the
bit-image mode will be cancelled
before selecting expanded print.
STANDARD - this does the reverse
of EXPANDED, selecting the normal
print width. Again, i f this command
is executed from the bit-image mode,
then the bit-image mode will be
cancelled.
UPPERLOWER - is used to select the
upper lower character set o n  a
Commodore compatible printer. This
mode is only in operation for one line,
so i f  the printer channel has been
opened using OPEN NAG then after
one line, printing will lapse back into
the Graphics character set.
GRAPHICS -  t h e  s a m e  a s
UPPERLOWER, but selects the
graphics character set.
RVSON - used to select reverse video
printing on a Commodore compatible
printer. Another command is provided
for this action on a non-Commodore
printer.
RVSOFF - turns reverse printing off
on a Commodore compatible printer.
BITIMAGE -  will only work on a
Commodore compatible printer and
puts the printer into the bit image
mode for performing screen dumps,
etc.
JUSTIFYLEET -  will only work i f
NLQ printing is switched on. I t
formats the incoming text so that it's
ﬂush against the left margin. This is
the normal mode of operation when
the printer is turned on.
JUSTIFYR IG HT - works in a similar
way to JUSTIFY LEFT, but keeps all
text ﬂush against the right hand
margin.
CENTRE -  w i l l  centre a l l  th e
following text between the left and
right margins.
JUSTIFY BOTH - if there are enough
characters on the line, will attempt to
fully justify each line by increasing the
spacing between characters.
Commands requiring an 0,N7 OFF
parameter
NLQ ON/OFF - will, of course, only
work with a printer, supporting NLQ,
serves to turn this style of printing on
or off.

DOU BLEWIDTH ON/OFF -  may
seem the same as EXPANDED, but
this command works with an Epson
compatible printer rather than a
Commodore printer.
COMPRESSED ON/ OFF - switches
on or off the compressed pitch, which
effectively doubles the number o f
characters per line.
PORPORT1ONAL O N / O F F  —
turns the proportional printing mode
on or off. Proportional printing is such
that each character only takes up as
much space a s  i t  needs (See
INCREASE)
EMPHASISED ON /OFF -  turns
emphasised printing on or off. When
turned on, each character is printed
twice in one position, and then one
dot across. There is no signiﬁcant
decrease in printing speed.
DOUBLESTRIKE O N / O F F  -
switches on or off the doublestrike
printing. With doublestrike printing
on, each line is printed, then printed
again on top o f the ﬁrst one. This
means that printing speed is halved.
ITALIC ON/OFF i s  used to turn
italicised printing on or off.
UNDERLINE ON/OFF - serves the
purpose of switching underlining on
or off.
REVERSE ON/OFF - turns reverse
video printing on or off on an Epson
compatible printer. It cannot be used
on a Commodore printer as the control
codes are different, which is why it has
been duplicated.
SUPERSCRIPT ON/ OFF -  selects
whether the superscript typeface is to
be used. The superscript style is half
the height o f normal printing, and
appears in the top half of the line.
SUBSCRIPT ON/ OFF -  does the
same a s  SUPERSCRIPT, b u t
selecting Subscript printing. This is
similar, but characters appear in the
lower half of the line. Note that the
control c o d e s  f o r  sw i tch i n g
Superscript or Subscript off are the
same, so SUPERSCRIPT OFF will
turn Subscript printing o ff, and
inversely SUBSCRIPT OFF will turn
Superscript printing off.
DOUBLEHEIGHT ON /OFF will
switch the double height printing on
or off. This effect is only available on
some printers.
DOWNLOAD ON/OFF -  used to
select whether the ROM character set
of the printer is used, or the RAM
character set. Note that to  use the
RAM character set, the data for it
must ﬁrst be downloaded. Since this
requires many parameters, a command
has not been provided for the purpose.
(See your printer manual.)
UNIDIRECTION ON /OFF - tells the
printer if it is to print bi-directionally
(printing while moving i n  both
directions) or only in one direction.
The unidirectional mode is used when
exact alignment o f  characters i s
required on consecutive lines.
SLASHEDZERO ON/OFF used to
deﬁne whether a zero printed on the
printer has a slash through it or not.
Slashed zeros are more practical for
program listings, but unslashed zeros
look better.
PAPEROUT ON/OFF -  enables or
disables the paperout sensor. This is
useful when using a single-sheet feeder.
Commands requiring a  numeric
parameter
INCREASE 0-255 takes a parameter
in the range of 0-255 and increases the
spacing between characters when pro-
portional printing is selected. The
input value is the increase in dots.
CHARACTERSET 0-255 -  selects
which of the international character
sets is to be used for printing. Usually'
the printer has eleven character sets
in the range of 0-11 and these are as
follows on a Commodore compatible
such as the Citizen 120D.
0 - U.S.A.
I - France
2 -Germany
3 - England
4 - Denmark # I
5 - Sweden
6 Ita l y
PRINTERS
7 - Spain
8 - Japan
9 Norway
10 -Denmark # 2
II -Commodore
PAGESIZELINE 0-255 - used to tell
the printer how big each piece of paper
is. The input parameter is the depth
in lines and is typically 66 lines.
PAGESIZEINCH 0-255 -used t o
deﬁne the paper size, but this time it
is deﬁned in terms of inches. The size
of a normal piece of computer listing
paper is eleven inches.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
39
LEETMARGIN 0-255 -  sets the left
margin to the input value in characters.
Usually this value will only be in the
range of 0-80.
RIGHTMARGIN 0-255 - identical to
the LEFTMARGIN command, but
sets the right margin position.
SETHTABS 0-255 -  identical to the
LEFTMARGIN command, but sets
the right margin position.
SETH TABS 0-255 - deﬁnes where on
a line the horizontal tab positions are.
The input parameter is 'every n
characters'. For example, if you want
tab to tab, use the TAB command.
RELATIVETAB 0-255 - used to move
the print head position. The input
parameter is the number of characters
for i t  t o  move. F o r  example,
RELATIVETAB 10 moves the head
ten characters to the right.
DOTABSOLUTE 0-65535 -  takes a
I6-bit parameter and is used to set the
print position in terms of dots. The
input parameter is an absolute dot
position, and the command will move
to that position from wherever it is
on a line.
DOTRELATIVE 0-65535 -  the same
as DOTABSOLUTE except that the
input parameter is a relative position.
For example, to move the head 320
dots to the right, use DOTRELATIVE
320.
SETVTABS 0-255 s i m i l a r  t o
SETHTABS and is used to  deﬁne
where on a  page the vertical tab
positions are. Moving from one
vertical tab to another is performed
using the VERTICALTAB command.
ADVANCEPAPER 0-255 -  moves
the paper forward a number of lines.
It can be used for label printing or
moving over letterheads, etc.
SINGLE DENSITY 0-65535 - used to
select the single density graphics mode
on an Epson compatible printer. The
input parameter is the number of dots
per line. The only way of leaving a
graphic mode is to print a full line of
graphics.
DOUBLEDENSITY 0-65535 -
performs t h e  same a cti o n  a s
SINGLEDENSITY, but selects the
double density mode running at low
speed for extra accuracy. Again, the
input parameter is the number of dots
per line.

FASTDOUBLE 0-65535 - identical to
DOUBLEDENSITY, but selects the
double density mode running at high
speed. The result of this is that columns
of graphics are a little further apart,
but speed is kept at an optimum.
QUADDENSITY 0-65535 t h e  same
as the preceding commands, but selects
the quadruple graphics mode which
prints four times as many dots in a
given width than the single density
mode.
Patching in the System
The BASIC Loader Program
The BASIC Loader program is used
to POKE the machine code for Easi-
Print into RAM. To  perform this,
simply type in the program and RUN
it. Any data errors will be reported.
If the data is correct, the program will
prompt for tape or disk, and then save
the BASIC program, and the machine
code ﬁle.
Using EasiPrint in your own programs
The ﬁrst lines of your program must
be the following:
10 I F  L 9 c
"EASIPRINT CODE",8,1
20 POKE 55,121:POKE 56, 120:CLR
30 SYS 32757
Line 10 loads the EasiPrint machine-
code. If you are using tape instead of
disk, then change the ,8,I to ,1,1.
Line 20 sets the top o f  memory
pointers to protect the machine-code.
This leaves about 25K free for BASIC.
Line 3 0  enables th e  EasiPrint
commands.
Note that all commands that
EasiPrint sends to the printer are sent
through channel number 14. I t  is
unlikely that this channel is used in
any of your programs, but if it is. you
must change this to another number.
Since the EasiPrint program is
wedged into the Execute Command
routine through the vector at $308,
rather than the CHRGET routine, it
should remain compatible with most
other language extensions such as
DOS 5.2.
The Demonstration Program
This short program serves as a demon-
stration o f  programming using
EasiPrint. It is entered and RUN in
the normal way, but if you arc using
tape instead of disk, change the ,8,1
in line 10 to .1,1
PRINTERS
Changing EasiPrint for Other Printers
It is not feasible to redeﬁne the actual
commands themselves included i n
EasiPrint, as their texts are tokenised
(i.e. DOtABSolute). However, if you
have a  non-standard printer, i t  is
possible to change which control codes
are sent to the printer, or to disable
certain commands. There are three
types of commands - no paramaters,
On/Off paramater, and numeric
parameter. Each of these is stored in
a different format in RAM as shown
below:
No Parameters
BYTE: 01234567890123456789012
DATA: C O M M A N D  N A M E /
CODE/ -----
The Command Name, which is
stored in the same format for all types
of commands, i s  th e  tokenised
command text e.g. italic. It can be 12
tokenised characters long maximum.
Each command is terminated with a
CHRS(255) to mark the end.
The Code is the set up o f four
control codes to be sent to the printer,
stored as one byte number. Again,
these are terminted with a CH RS( 255).
On/Off Parameters
BYTE: 01234567890123456789012
DATA: COMMAND NAME/ON../
OFF./
The Command Name is as above.
The ON.. and OFF. are the control
codes fo r respectively turning the
function on o r o ff on the printer.
Again, they can be u p  t o  fo u r
characters l o n g  each, a n d  a r e
terminated with a CHRS(255).
Numerical Paramaters
BYTE: 01234567890123456789012
DATA: C O M M A N D  N A M E /
CODE?
The Command Name is as above.
The Code is the set of control codes
to be sent to the printer. Next comes
which is a CHRS(192) character.
After this is a ? character which tells
Easi Print which sort of parameter to
expect. They are encoded as follows:
SC1 - Expect Byte Parameter
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
40
5C2 - Expect I6-Bit Parameter
•When Ea si Pri n t ﬁn d s  t h e
CHRS( 192) character, i t then sees
what sort of input is needed, gets this
input and then sends the input value
to the printer. If the value is 8-Bit, it
is sent as a normal CHRS code. but
if it is 16-bit, it is sent as two 8-bit
CHRS codes, least signiﬁcant byte
ﬁrst.
Changing EasiPrint Control Codes
By now, you should have a reasonable
idea of how EasiPrint data is stored
in RAM. To change the control codes
for a certain command, the procedure
is shown below. The example shown
is to change the control codes sent by
*NLQ to (ESC)NLI to turn NLQ on,
and (FSC)NLO to turn NLQ off, as
might be the case in a non-standard
printer.
• Turn the control codes into hexa-
decimal bytes:
ON TEXT: (ESC) 'N "L "I'
ON HEX: SIB $4E $4C $31
OFF TEXT: (ESC) 'N"L"O'
OFF HEX: SIB $4E 54C $31
Because each set of control codes
is stored in a ﬁxed ﬁeld of 5 bytes,
we must add a WE' to signify the end
of the control sequence. Therefore, we
have:
HEX: IB 4E 4C 31 FF IB 4E 31 FF
On 
O
f
• Calculate the address at which the
data is to be stored:
Address fo r * N L Q i s $76D (See
Command Reference.)
Add 13 to  this to  skip over the
command names:
New address: $7C7A
• Poke the bytes into RAM.
Enter TEDMON using MONITOR
(Return)
Enter the bytes:
›7C7A I  B 4E 4C 31 FF I  B 4E 4C
(Return)
2
• Save a new copy of EasiPrint:
Insert a new disk or tape and type:
S "EASIPRINT CODE",8,7879.8000
for Disk Users
S -
for Tape Users
Finally, exit TEDMON and return to
BASIC by typing: X (Return)
As you can see, it's no easy job,
but unless you have a very interesting
printer, it should not be necessary to
perform the above!

I Q
it is a computer game. Confused? You will be. MUD
is an acronym for multi-user dungeon.
The original idea was that several people
participated in the adventure simultaneously,
connected to a mainframe via a modem.
Character interaction was the name of the game. Now,
because not many people have access to a modem, Virgin
have brought out a one player version of the game.
But doesn't that kill the whole raison d'etre behind the
game I hear you all screaming. Well yes and no. For the
game comes complete with a character disk containing
details of one hundred fellow adventurers, ten of whom
are picked at random to go adventuring with you whenever
you load the game. Obviously, the degree of interaction
is nowhere near as high as in the orignal but the ﬂavour
of the game is still retained.
The objective of the game is to reach the exalted level
of wizard or witch by scoring more than 102400 experience
points. Points can be gained in three main ways. Collecting
and storing treasure, killing an opponent or performing
some minor task. If you want to become a wizard by kicking
the beggar 102400 times, then so be it.
To collect treasure, it has to be dropped in the swamp
where it sinks without a trace. This might seem pretty drastic
but it does stop the other players from grabbing it.
Because the amount of treasure available is ﬁnite, the
game resets every forty to sixty minutes restoring everything
to its former position. This is something else that you must
come to terms with. MUD is played in real time so there
is no point in hanging about. Similarly, different actions
take different lengths of time and the game carries on while
these are being performed.
Killing an opponent garners you one twelfth o f his
experience points. The disadvantage here though is that
you could get killed yourself. You have no say in combat
once it has been initiated but must just sit back and await
the Outcome, which depends on the player's strength,
dexterity and stamina ratings.
There are two ways of dying in MUD, Dead and dead
dead. The latter occurs when you are defeated in combat
and means game over time. Your character is irretrievably
lost. Dead occurs when you try to do something silly such
G A ME S  R E V I E W
as leaping off the cliff without a parachute. You are kicked
out of the game and lose all awards for that session.
There are various magic spells that you can use. Anyone
can attempt to cast one but the chance of success depends
on your skill level at the time and there could be dire
consequences if one goes wrong on you. So don't try casting
Finger of Death when you ﬁrst enter the game.

Most of the commands can be abbreviated to save you
from typing errors if you are trying to do something quickly.
Commands can be linked with 'and' or 'then' which gives
the parser a reasonable degree of sophistication although
nobody would ever claim that it was supposed to be the
game's strong point.
It is worthwhile ﬁnding out which characters are present
at any stage in the game. You will need their help on several
occasions. The 'shout' command sends your message
throughout the land. With a bit of luck, some of the others
might even respond. Remember to reward anyone who does
help you. You don't want to be ambushed on the way back
to the swamp.
There are some 400 locations for you to explore -
cottages, graveyards, caves, forests and o f  course, the
bottom of the cliff together with anything that might be
out at sea. Descriptions are of medium length, again to
stop you from being killed while you read them,
The packaging consists of a thirty page manual together
with a copy of the book 'An Introduction to MUD' which
gives details of the mainframe game. Although the one
player is largely the same, there are some signiﬁcant
differences.
A one player version of MUD can never hope to capture
the spirit of the original entirely, although Virgin have made
a tremendous effort and their version of MUD is one that
every adventurer should own. At ﬁfteen pounds, it offers
tremendous value for money with the added advantage of
no phone bills to pay afterwards. Now, if you will excuse
me, there is a certain necromancer who is due for his
comeuppance after what he did to me last week. G . R . H .

Photo Finish
Photo Finish is the perfect complement to ICON Factory.
enabling you to transfer your ﬁnished pictures to paper.
There are countless 'hi-res screen dump' programs i n
circulation, but Photo Finish stands a  full head and
shoulders above the rest. As with ICON Factory, Photo
Finish can cope with many different image formats.
Hi-res pictures pose no problems, as your printer only
has to reproduce the foreground colour (unless you decide
to print a negative of the original, in which case only the
background is printed).
Multi-colour pictures need to  be treated slightly
differently, as each colour on the original picture has to
be converted into a shade of grey before the printer can
make sense of it! Photo Finish offers the facility to design
your own grey scales or use the default scale. Because a
dot matrix printer can only print a dot or NOT print a
dot, each of the Cozt's colours can be assigned a shade
block t h e  more dots in the shade block, the darker that
colour is represented on paper! If that sounds complicated,
it's not, just a little difﬁcult to explain
Photo Finish also makes use of the Optimizer, allowing
you to print four times the dot density of normal hi-res
screen dumps, improving the ﬁnished product no end.
Printers are ﬁckle things at the best of times, so much
depends on the make of your printer, the make of interface
and how you set all those annoying DIP switches. There
isn't any easy solution here, but Photo Finish makes the
best of the situation by offering several 'standard' printer
deﬁnitions, plus the capacity to deﬁne a  non-standard
printer. I used a Citizen LSP 10 with a Micrograﬁx interface
and had no problems.

ICON Factory
•
2-
Trir
ICON Factory is literally an Image CONverting system that
can be used to mix and match images from the most popular
Billboard
Billboard Maker completes the trio, with the unbelievable
ability to blow up your pictures to an incredible four feet
by three feet! Before you turn away in disbelief, with crys
of "Where can I get paper that big?" and "April Fool's
day was last month!", let me explain. Billboard prints out
on your normal A4 size paper, but it breaks the super-
enlarged picture up into strips. You then stick the strips
together to make up the ﬁnished picture!
Once again, the presentation o f this package leaves
nothing to be desired. The theme this time is not a factory,
but a  printing works, complete with photo lab, art
department, typesetting room and a switchboard to help
you ﬁnd your way around.
Everything you need to turn a picture created on, say,
Koala Pad into a full size poster is under the one 'root!
The photo lab lets you load a picture and change its
appearance using the menu options to strip away the colour,
crop the picture to the right size, add borders and generally
tidy things up. The Optimizer re-appears here, and can be
selected to smooth out your picture. The typesetter's ofﬁce
is where you add text to your pictures, in a variety of fonts
and styles, prior to printing. Finally,
where your creations become reality!
Throughout the package, the menu system (similar to
Photo Finish and ICON Factory) is a delight to use.
Billboard Maker is by far the most complex package of
the three but the results more than justify this; be prepared
to spend some time reading the manual though!

General Comments
All three packages are beautifully presented, carefully
documented and sensibly priced. While all three will set
you back a few quid, it must be stressed that each package
is designed to run independently of the others, while still
complementing them.
If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you can
use Photo Finish or Billboard maker with your printer and
interface, the answer is probably YES! However some
hardware combinations could prove troublesome and
strongly suggest you purchase your package from a dealer
likely to offer support if you run into trouble.

C64 graphics packages; Printshop, Newsroom, Koala Pad,
Blazing Paddles, to name but a few. You could be forgiven
for mistaking ICON Factory for a game, such is the quality
and attention to detail.
The main menu screen is designed as a 'factory building'
each of the factory windows is a scrolling menu for one
part of the program. Fl selects the *window', while cursor
up/down scrolls through the options. Once an image has
been loaded into memory there is very little you can't do
with it. ICON Factory has another unique feature, called
'Optimizer'. When you are enlarging graphics, Optimizer
attempts to ADD detail, smoothing out ragged lines. This
could cause problems if you try to enlarge a graphic too
many times with Optimizer turned on - the end result would
be a shapeless blob! Practically though, Optimizer can add
that professional touch to your artwork.
Let's take a typical application; a Printmaster graphic
can be blown up to full-screen size, cropped, overlayed on
a Koala Pad picture and saved as a Blazing Paddles ﬁle
with just a few simple operations.

Star LC -10
Printer
In the search for
daisywheel quality' at
dot matrix speed,
we look at the latest twinkle
in Star Micronic's eye
By Eric Doyle
H
allelujah! At last a printer with
a decent manual. I  d o n ' t
mean that it's  perfect but
I'm pleased to see a relatively sensible
layout. a pull-out guide sheet and an
index. T h e  printer itself is  rather
impressive and at last Star Mieronics
seems to be coming to grips with the
needs of the user.
Star's LC-10 is a dot matrix printer
of the latest generation offering more
than the usual options o f  various
international character sets: N L Q
(high quality) or draft printing styles in
a variety of typefaces. italics, graphic
mode, user-deﬁnable characters.
subscript and superscripts underlining
and overlining. proportional spacing.
Page formatting also follows the tried
and tested options to give differing
page w id t h s  a n d  lengths , tabs ,
centring, left and right justiﬁcation.
various line spacings. and mac ro
instruction strings but what makes this
machine 'new' arc the extra options.
The Epson standard is impossible
IC) deﬁne accurately because every time
the opposition start scoring against
them. Epson moves the goalposts, Star
always offer Epson compatibility and
in the past this has meant pica, elite
and condensed type styles with italic
options. Star have now added various
typefaces to the standard set of NII.Q
Courier characters with Sanserif and
H A R D W A R E  R E V I E W
Orator styles, An example is given in
Listing I. N o  longer  does  every
document hav e t o  look  the same,
new emphasis can now be given to
important passages by  varying the
typefaces.
The pr inter  c an als o handle
tractor-fed continuous stationery or
hopper-fed single sheets for  headed
notepaper or one-off printouts. The
tractor feed has migrated fr om its
usual position over the platten and
print head t o  become a  push feed
system. Now, instead o f  the paper
being pulled through the printer and
over the platten, it is pushed towards
the platten. This has two advantages.
The ﬁrst is a super sleek appearance
to the printer and the second is one of
paper economy,

When lacing up tractor-fed paper
a leading sheet had to be wasted so that
the paper  w ould engage o n  t h e
sprockets after being fed between the
platten and the print head. With the
new push feed the paper meets the
sprockets before reaching the platten.
This is especially advantageous when
using peel-off address labels because a
run can start with the ﬁrst label on a
sheet instead o f  starting a t  t h e
beginning of the second sheet.
Another new implementation is
the ability  t o  automatically 'par k '
continuous stationary to allow single
sheets to be used. By pressing a certain
combination o f  buttons on the very
useful front control panel, the paper is
pulled o u t  o f  the printer b y  the
sprockets leaving the paper path clear.

A sheet of headed notepaper can then

At last the Centronics connection

small and awkward to set and I would
have preferred to have seen a sensibly
positioned covered panel with larger
slider switches.
The manual gives two example
listings in PC style Microsoft Basic
which can easily be converted for the
Commodore. One listing shows how
commands can be issued to the printer
through software and the other is a
very useful character designer. I f  you
think y o u  c a n  impr ov e o n  t h e
typefaces included i n  the printer's
operating system o r  i f  you need to
design a character for a speciﬁc use,
the Download Character Generator
will give you a grid to work from for
both NLQ and draft mode characters.
Anyone who has tried to deﬁne their
own characters w ill k now what a
headache this can be and I welcome
this listing from Star.
The rest o f  the manual shows a
departure from Star 's usual style of
overplaying instructions. Here each
facility is given a few lines with a nice
bold title. The ease o f  ﬁnding the
facility which you need is made much
simpler this way as does the inclusion
of an index. The only facilities which
are g iv e n  ex t r a s pac e a r e  t h e
descriptions of download, user deﬁned
characters and setup and maintenance
notes.
A ﬁnal round of applause is given
to Star because the printer head is easy
to replace. Although years of use can
be expected f r o m  a  p r in t  head,
accidents do happen and the expense
of having to have the head replaced by
a professional can prove inhibitive.
Mechanically, the printer is well
constructed and all o f  the working
parts are readily accessible. The one
Achilles' heel is the cover for the drive
sprockets which clips into place but
doesn't seem Nrery resilient. O n the
machine supplied for review, the cover
clips barely held the cover in place.
Normally this would be a very minor
complaint but on the LC-I0 the semi
automatic, sheet hopper attaches onto
this cover and the ﬂoppiness could
cause problems.
With the LC-I0, Star Micronics
has placed a  handsomely styled.
professional-quality printer within the
grasp of the home user - my advice is
to grab it with both hands.

The Role of the Interrupt
A
extensive use of interrupts to
be able to  cope with the
musical demands put upon it, at least
on the Commodore 64. I'm  n o t
suggesting that M r . Moog had a
thorough working knowledge o f
interrupts (but you never know...)!
However, i t is possible to  lay the
ground work, and produce a program
at the same time that will stretch the
C64 to its limits.
The interrupt's main function is to play
background rhythms, which in turn
allows the features of ring modulation
and synchronisation to be used to their
full extent. Editing features can be used
to put these rhythms into memory, or
indeed produce the data fo r vast
musical soundtracks that can be
played back later using a  totally
different program, but still running
under interrupt control.
For now, however, we are more
concerned with the simple playing of
notes on a  keyboard, and gaining

knowledge of the various aspects of
the SID chip before committing our
magnum opus to memory (tape and
disk as well probably); the end result
will be all the better for it.
Fiddle about to  your heart's
content, altering anything a n d
everything as you see ﬁt. But do
remember that there might be other
people listening in, and your idea of
a number one h i t album, ﬁl m
soundtrack, or whatever, might not
necessarily coincide with theirs!
The Actual Program
The screen display is initially divided
into two parts. To  the left o f the
dividing line there are three rows of
musical keys covering three octaves.
To play a note using any of those rows
of keys then press a key from 'Z' to
'M' for the bottom row, 'A' to f o r
the middle row, or 'Q' to 'U' for the
top one. The little sprite face will
follow you around, just to let you
know what you are.

Continuing our music series, this month we look at the
Commodore's ability to synthesise and the all important
role of interrupts
information. At the top of the screen
you'll see a small display telling you
which keys to press to produce a note.
The function keys are also indicated,
and in the order Ft to F8 they play
chords in the keys of C, D, E, F, G,
A, B and C again respectively. These
chords are played in the same octave
as that currently being used by the
bottom row of the on-screen keyboard,
or in the computer's terms, the keys
'Z' to 'M'.
To change octaves, you will see that
you can press the' I 'to go down an
octave, or the ' @ ' key to go up an
octave. Since there are limits beyond
which you and I cannot hear anything,
but any surrounding pets might be
driven beyond endurance, the 64 is
kept to a certain limit with its octave
range, but can nevertheless cope quite
happily with about an 8 octave span.
All o f these are available using this
program.
You'll see on the next line down
the mysterious term glissando, but any
fan of Steve Hillage will tell you what
this is all about. Pressing the '*' key
turns the glissando effect off or on
(toggles i t, i n  other words), and

although this feature only works on
voice one it can be used to produce
some startling sounds. Glissando is,
basically, a musical term meaning "the
effect produced by sliding the top or
back o f the ﬁnger over piano-forte
keys or harp-strings, or along ﬁddle-
string, o r  by -
according to my Reader's Digest Great
Encyclopaedic Dictionary.
Slip Sliding Away
The important thing to remember here
is the 'sliding' part, because a glissando
effect (in terms of our program) is one
which slides a note from one value to
another, at a varying speed dependant
on the glissando rate selected (chosen
here by pressing the '=' key to vary
the rate from 0 to 8). To put it another
way, it is possible to coast happily from
C in one octave to C about two octaves
above it, playing all the frequencies in-
between a t a  pre-selected rate. So
what? Well, apart from sounding very
pretty, try using it when other voices
are being modulated or synchronised
with voice one. The effects are very,
very interesting, and are just the sort
of thing that would have Steve Hillage
drooling over his woolly hat and old
hippies lighting joss-sticks everywhere.
To you and me, it produces a highly
individual sound effect.
Below that, we can see that by
pressing the keys 1-7 a variety of voices
can be turned on and off. How does
the program choose three voices from
a selection o f keys 1-7? Well, i t all
works on a  binary basis, so that
pressing the following keys has these
results...
Key pressed 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Voices Active 5 I 2 1/ 2 3 1/3 2/ 3 1/
2/ 3
As you can see, pressing key '1'
simply turns voice one on, pressing key
'5' turns on voice one and three,
pressing key '7' turns on all three
voices, and so on for all points in-
between. A  simple way of using the
minimum amount of keys to produce
the maximum amount of result.
Further on down the right hand
side o f  the screen you'll see that
pressing the RETURN key allows you
to alter the characteristics of the voices,
and pressing that key takes you into
another menu where the waveforms,
ADSR settings, ring modulation and
synchronisation for all three voices can
be altered to your heart's content.
Finally, you'll note that the CTRL
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G  d i
key gives you control over the ﬁltering
parameters, and pressing that key gives
you access to a further menu, this time
allowing you to select which of the
three voices you want ﬁltered, what
sort of ﬁlter you want, what sort of
resonance you want, and ﬁnally what
the cutoff frequency is to be. After that,
back to  the main display and the
chance to listen to the fruits of your
labours.
One o r  tw o  other keys, n o t
mentioned o n  the screen, produce
results as well. Pressing the '+' key
turns all the waveforms off (silence!),
and pressing keys H
O M E Y
and IIINST/DELY will allow you to
selectively turn off the waveforms for
voices one, two and three respectively.
Just a  simple way o f  achieving a
blessed silence.
Later on we'll be adding to this
program, when we look at the section
on interrupts. When you've quite
ﬁnished, it's time to  (almost) say
goodbye to Basic and to start delving
into the murky depths of machine code
on the Commodore 64. But don't
worry, you'll be able to  use the
programs and routines presented even
if your knowledge of machine code is
as good as my knowledge o f the
workings of the House of Commons.
I know that a lot of things in there
make a lot of noise, and that's precisely
what we're going to be doing!
Sound and Machine Code
We've lamented the absence o f any
speciﬁc commands for dealing with
sound on the Commodore 64 other
than a  straightforward POKE and
PEEK before now. N o  SOUND
commands, n o  E N V E L O P E
commands, and so on. While this is,
in one sense, a very good thing, as it
means that anyone playing about with
sound has got to know an awful lot
about the workings of the sound chip
before they can get anything to
happen, in another sense i t is most
certainly not a good thing. This is
because all but the most determined
of people would surely be put off by
the sheer welter o f POK Es to  go
through before even a single note can
be played, the myriad o f  control
registers and locations to remember,
and even the vast number o f multi-
purpose registers that needs to  be
taken into account before the required
sound c a n  b e  produced w i t h
conﬁdence and competence.
In the absence of anything else, of
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
47
CED
course, there's always the option of
going out and buying something like
a Simon Basic o r  some other
'command-adder'. Sadly, this would
mean that any great works composed
using these aids would not be able to
work on anyone else's Commodore 64
unless they too had the same utility.
Consequently, i t is always better to
produce some homemade extensions
to Basic that can, i f  necessary, he
carried within the heart of the program
using them.
Tools of the Trade
Let's look at how in theory, a number
of aids could be added. They're not
extensions exactly, b u t  ra th e r
additions t o  th e  normal Basic
repertoire. They should be in the form
of SYS calls, but since we can SYS
for variables as well as numbers, we'll
only have t o  set variables like
VOLUME, S O U N D ,  A D S R ,
FILTER, WAVEFORM etc. at the
start of the program, and could then
rely on the following:
SYS VOLUME, 15
SYS WAVEFORM,17,1 1
SYS ADS R,9,0,0,255
SYS FILTER 1,2
SYS FREQ 8,1500
SYS SOUND,147,8
to set up everything required to make
a few noises. Always remember,
though, when using variables of this
nature, that the C64 only uses the ﬁrst
two letters o f a variable name and
discards the rest. Therefore that
SOUND would be equivalent in 64
terms to SOLID, also, we cannot have
variable names like SONAR, as that
contains the Basic keyword 'on', and
the 64 doesn't like you using Basic
keywords as part of variable names.
So, how do we go about setting
up a series of commands like the above
mentioned ones? Well, ﬁrst of all we'll
need to  make use o f a number o f
internal ROM routines for setting up
and receiving parameters. The ﬁrst of
these is at SAUD, while the second
lives at $137E13. To use them, a simple
program like this could be used:
10 11=0
20 READ A:IF A < > -I THEN POKE
49152+1,A:1=1+1:GOT020
30 END
100 DATA 32,253,174,141,33,208,32,
235,183,142,32,208,96

110 DATA-1
Having entered and run this program,
you could then type in:
SYS 49152,0,12
and see a  perfectly hideous screen
display as a  result. The point is,
however, that i t works, and i t  is
possible to pass parameters to  and
from machine code routines without
any undue fuss and bother. To go from
screen to sound is a simple matter, and
if need be, it is possible to put a triangle
waveform in voice one so we could
change our data to read:
100 DATA 169,00,141,04,212,32,253,
174,10,10,10,10,105,01
101 DATA 141,04,212,96
which would mean a  call o f SYS
49152,1 would put a triangle wave in
voice one, or SYS 49152,2 would put
a sawtooth wave there, and so on,
without t h e  n e e d  t o  P O K E
54272,0:POKE 54272,17, or whatever.
However, none of this is really any
great improvement on the standard
PEEK P O K E  approach. Use it and
play with it by all means, but do not
expect miracles as a result o f doing
so. Far better to stick to old friends,
and use the speed and power o f
machine code to  do other, more
dramatic things. SYS calls to variables
are all very well, but it doesn't take
that long for a sequence of, say, ﬁve
POKE commands to  be obeyed.
Longer than in machine code, yes, but
not signiﬁcantly so in terms of sounds
produced. So, we must use machine
code for those parts o f a program
where we cannot possibly begin to use
Basic, and chief among these must be
in the use of interrupts.
As I said, feel free to play about
with passing parameters from a Basic
call to  a  machine code routine.
However it is much better to reserve
machine code for something which is
really useful rather than a minor saving
of one or two bytes and an extension
to Basic that doesn't really make life
any easier.
Using Interrupts
Every ﬁftieth of a second or so the
64 whizzes away from whatever it's
doing, and goes o ff to update the
internal clock, check o n  a  fe w
C64 PROGRAMMING d i
operations, before returning to normal
and letting Basic and everything else
proceed as i f nothing has happened.
The routine to do this starts at SEA3I,
and i f we can interrupt this routine
and perform a  few housekeeping
chores of our own then we can create
the impression o f  a multi-tasking
computer. That is, one that is capable
of doing more than one thing at a time.
It won't be, of course - it will merely -
be doing several different things very
quickly. But, by judicious use of code,
we can make this multi-tasking look
very realistic indeed.
It is this interrupting of interrupts
that gives us the ability to produce,
among other things, background
musical soundtracks for our normal
Basic (or machine code for all matter)
programs. Later we'll be looking at
how soundtracks can easily be made
to last up to ten minutes and beyond,
by taking up very tittle memory at all.
To interrupt the 64 on its way we
must remember three golden rules:
• Make sure you interrupt the 64
properly.
• Make sure that your own code
works.
• Make sure that the 64 gets to $E.A31
in the end.
This may seem obvious, but it's
surprising how often, and how easily,
things can go wrong!
First of all we'll need to interrupt
the 64. There are tw o  memory
locations used to  control the ﬁnal
whereabouts of this interrupt, which
incidentally is termed the Hardware
Interrupt Vector, or HIV, and these
are locations 788 and 789. If we simply
PEEK these we'll see that they initially
contain the values 31 and EA, and
reversing things around in the time
honoured tradition of the 64 brings us
to the ﬁnal location of SEA31.
Now suppose we want to have the
64 perform some chore of our own
before it gets to $E,A31, and that our
own code starts at location $C000. A
convenient place, being the start of the
4K spare block of RAM above Basic
and some of the ROM, but below the
sound and graphics work area and the
rest of the ROM. We would need, ﬁrst
of all, to  split $C000 up into two
components, namely $CO and $OO, and
then convert these two numbers into
decimal terms. Obviously $OO is going
to be equal to  zero i n  whatever
counting system you're working in
(don't all write in at once, please!), and
SCO converts to  192 i n  decimal.
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988

CI 0
Swapping those numbers around gives
us a 192 and a 00 to POKE into the
two locations mentioned earlier, and
to alter the HIV we could just:
POKE 788,00:POKE 789,192
However, due to the speed of the
64 this will sometimes cause a 'crash',
where the machine just gives up in
disgust and will have nothing to do
with you. Better then to have a little
routine in machine code which we can
call to  turn the H IV  to  our new
location, or revert to its old location,
depending on which we want to do
at the time. The following program will
load some code into the top end of
memory and enable us to get from one
to the other.
10 FOR 1=0 TO 21
15 READ A
20 POKE 52992÷1,A
30 NEXT LEND
100 DATA 169,00,141,20,03,169,192,141,
21,03.96
105 DATA 169,49,141,20,03,169,234,141,
21,03,96
Type in this program, but don't run
it yet! We have no code in $COO yet,
so add the following to the program,
and change line 30 to read 30 NEXT
40 FOR 141 TO 7:READ A:POKE
49152+1,A:NEXT I:END
150 DATA 169,41,141,00,04,76,49,234
Nothing too startling yet, because
all this does is put a heart into the
top left hand corner o f the screen.
However, i t is impossible to get rid
off, without removing interrupts, and
so it does at least serve the purpose.
To get our heart up there we must:
SYS 52992
and to turn interrupts back to normal
again we'll have to:
SY 53003
This will work without the machine
crashing! Now, with the HIV diverted,
our little heart will remain on screen.
Set the HIV hack to normal again, and
the heart can be cleared at ease.
However, we want to do something
a tinge more impressive than that, so
we'll be looking a t using some
background music to play our songs
for us next time. See you then!

Pandora
1
 'Tears and years ago the generation ship Pandora was
sent out with a crew of droids and men to watch
out intelligent alien life. Now it is retur ruing to Earth
and your mission as a salvage agent is to ﬁnd out why.
Pandora is without doubt a dangerous place to be
it is believed to he controlled by a now renegade computer,
but it may contain invaluable alien attilacts. In fact your
early games could last less than a few seconds, as any attempt
to move without a valid ID  attracts the attention of the
roof lasers, but soon your quest will continue as an entry
ofﬁcer sacriﬁces himself to give you his ID.
The Pandora is a massive ship and is represented on
screen by a scrolling top down display that shows you
the ships rooms and corridors as well as the people, security
droids and mutants that now populate it. Below this the
screen displays what, i f anything you're holding and the
contents of your pockets or backpack as well as your current
health status that can range from mighty, through feeble
to dead, the distance to Earth (time left in the game) and
the name and equipment carried of any character or critter
you meet.
Your ﬁrst step is survival which means av oiding ﬁghts
with characters stronger than you are and then making sure
you have the right ID  at the right time. These ID's are
the key to the game and you can ﬁnd others on the corpses
of the crew members. Unfortunately, you can lose them
just as easily if the thief catches you, which he usually does,
as he hurtles around the ship at high speed. As you approach
some characters such as the drunk or the diabetic they'll
tell you what they need and i f you can solve the puzzle,
ﬁnd the object and return it, you may be able to trade
with them for another ID, a weapon, alien artifact or perhaps
YOUR COMMODORE iuly 1988
19
a means to defeat some of the extra tough aliens that seem
to guard the entrances to other sections of the ship.
In many rooms you'll also ﬁnd computer terminals that
you can plug into, with the tight ID, to learn more about
the ship, the crew and the objects you'll ﬁnd and the aliens
you'll trace. For example, apparently the ice creature is
susceptible to sound so if you can ﬁnd a source of sound
or the object you'll need to trade for it you might battle
your way through to another section of the ship.
Combat occurs whenever you collide with a critter and
is decided by a combination of timing and strategy. When
a ﬁght begins a bar overlays the object display showing
the strength of your adversary and besides that a sliding
gauge decides the strength of your hit. If you hit the ﬁre
button just before the gauge changes colour the blow strikes
your foe with the maximum power of the weapon you're
carrying. If your timing is out, the blow is weakened or
you miss altogether. Some ranged weapons such as a laser
riﬂe can be ﬁred from range and others are suited to hand
to hand combat and either increase the damage you can
do or the number of times you can strike.
Pandora is a difﬁcult game to play as the pressure of
the time limit causes ydu to charge around in a loosely
contt oiled panic. Once you've opened the Pandora box and
discovered some of its secrets you'll ﬁnd it difﬁcult to escape.

It's difﬁcult in a written review to
do full justice to the range of effects
available. Even a photograph lacks the
animated effects which makes this
program so good; it really does have
to be seen to be appreciated.
The main effects are based on the

in the television world. Venetian blinds

probably ﬁnd it  here. Textured
backgrounds or hi-res and multicolour
images can be mixed with text, window
overlays with shadows can be revealed
in a variety of patterns. Menus, multi-
window help screens, font changes can
all be achieved through an ingenious
programming system of option screen
menus.
The editing screen is the heart of
the program. Here each sequence of
events, or 'script', is created by building
up a series of effects. The program
•

ensures that all of the elements are
entered by creating a strict regime of
sub-menus from which the next step
or 'element' within an effect is selected.
The heirachy of script building is
to build up several 'elements' into an
effect. An element can be transparent,
visual or programmed. Transparent
elements are passive events such as
setting up a  background pattern,
ﬂipping an image or selecting fore-
ground and background colours.
Visual effects are the various types of
wipes which involve movement on the
screen. This also includes various
eveal techniques for displaying text.

of
Program effects bring into play a very
simple programming language which
allows loops to be created to repeat
a series of effects, or for getting a user
input for menu creation programs.
Altogether these effects can create
such scenarios as a text window in one
colour and pattern gradually material-
ising out of an overall background of
a different colour and pattern. This
effect is rather like the teleport effect
on Star Trek. The window can have
a border created by superimposing one
window on another larger window.
The border can then be used by
programming a text string to rotate
around its perimeter. Then the next
screen may appear as though venetian
blinds were opening out onto a new
world.
REVIEW
Despite the strict programming
environment the range of effects are
only limited by the user's imagination
and the computer's free memory. At
each stage the full routine can be run
through to check that all is well and
any mistakes can then be edited out.
Now for the bad news. The Screen
Fl X program was written in the USA,
therefore it  is strictly disk only.
Elements of the ﬁnished script are
loaded when they are needed so an
ambitious series of scripts can be
slowed down by the 1541 or  1571.
The good news is that ﬁnished
routines will run totally independently
program format to another. A picture
saved from the Computer Eye digitiser
can he rendered suitable for loading
into Blazing Paddles for further
manipulation. This is all very nice but
some of the popular British sourced
graphics programs, like CRL's Image
System and Advanced OC P Art
Studio from Rainbird, are not
supported.
The ﬁnal utility is one which
formats storage disks and copies ﬁles
for preparing your script disks.
This is a  novel program which
could be the answer to many a prayer
but serious programmers may prefer

achieved in any other way. For the
professional it's a great eye-opener.

May I Interrupt?
I
of interrupt programming has
been shown as a  dodge to get
spectacular effects. Some programs
are not very spectacular but they are
extremely useful as time savers. Printer
commands are tedious to type in and
execute, and if you turn off the printer
the commands have to be sent again.
Using the function keys can ease
the tedium but a special program has
to be written because the C64 does not
cater fo r  these potentially useful
devices.
The program outlined here sets
immediately accessible commands for
an Epson-type printer which operate
as soon as the key is touched; i n
conjunction with the CTRL key, the
command can be added to the current
screen line when building up a line of
Basic o r when a  directly executed
command is needed; or each function
key can be tailored to suit your needs.
There are two ways to approach
programming the function keys and
both are used here. One is to tag a
series of commands onto the normal
Basic handling routine by directing the
CHRGET routine based at $0073 to
jump into a special routine sequence
before reverting to the normal Basic
decoding routine. This means that the
return key must be pressed before the
command is executed. This is the
method used b y the ﬁrst program
Games aren't the only programs that use interrupts,
utilities can also butt in
By Eric Doyle
which services the key redeﬁne and
function list facilities.
For sending commands to  the
printer or the screen via the function
keys an interrupt is used so that the
keys behave as instantly as any of the
other keyboard keys.
Extending Basic
The C H R G E T  r o u ti n e  ta k e s
characters from the input buffer one
at a time, checks for a command word
and then hands over to the Basic
interpreter until the command is
complete or an error is found. The
routine then hands back to the 'ready
for a new input' handler.
To wedge in a command of your
own the CH RGET is changed to point
to your own routine which can then
pull out any new commands which you
want to use before passing onto the
normal decoding system.
The best way to  do this is by
selecting commands which start with
a different letter to  any keywords
which Basic has already deﬁned and
for this purpose the ' @ * symbol is
often used as a  preﬁx. Fo r  our
purposes using the K for key as our
search character means thar no Basic
words will be skipped because none
of the standard Basic keywords start
with K.
The CHRGET routine normally
looks like this:

To interrupt the execution of this
routine a  JMP $C000 command is
poked in just after the LDA $0200,
but the rest o f the routine must be
called from our wedged routine at
$C000.
Why Interrupt?
The commands stored on the function
keys are hidden under the Basic RAM
to save o n  programming space.
Therefore each command can be 80
characters long. I f  the redeﬁne
function is not required it need not
he loaded. Another code routine can
then be stored in $C000 because the
interrupt routine is booted from
SO2BC.
After the interrupt is set the routine
switches out Basic ready to service a
keypress. If a function key is pressed

the printer ﬁle is opened, a string is
sent out and the ﬁle is then closed.
If the CTRL key is pressed at the
same time as the function key the
routine jumps to the relevent print to
screen routine and the command chain
is printed to the current screen line.
If this line starts with a program line
number the command will be con-
catenated onto the line when return
is pressed. I f  no line number exists
you'll have to make sure that F2 has
been pressed to open the printer ﬁle
output.
The commands held on each key
at initialise are shown in Table
The commands fo r listing and
redeﬁning the keys use a  special
syntax. Key contents can be displayed
using KEYLIST and the command
held o n  a  particular key can be
changed by using KEYx=codes where
x is the actual key number.
On its own KEY! would simply
erase the key contents but this would
not happen i f a string of characters
is separated by commas. For example,
if F8 was accidentally erased it could
be reinstated by KEY8=27,64. If you

A
computer memory has to be
relocatable if it is to be of any
real use. If the program under scrutiny
and the disassembler locations clash,
one will overwrite the other.
Another occasion when a clash of
interests occurs is when a routine uses
autorun by loading through zero page
locations. Few disassemblers can cope
with this and a  relocatable loading
command i s required to  pull the
program into a  different part o f
memory. The problem with such a
method is that the memory locations
are changed to those relating to the
new location.
A disassembler which works direct
from disk has none of these problems.
It can even work with ﬁles which are
stored as sequential or relative ﬁles.
This version of disk assembler lacks
some of the facilities of a sophisticated
disassembler but will develop its
powers i n  future issues o f  Your
Commodore. Commands such as
string searches and replacement
printer dumps and speciﬁc track and
sector (T&S) manipulations are
already in the pipeline but if you write
your o w n  routines o r  have any
suggestions for a speciﬁc function or
modiﬁcation that you'd like to see,
please write to me at the magazine's
editorial address. Do not try to phone
me because I'm rarely in the ofﬁce
these days but don't tell the editor, I
don't think he's noticed yet!
The Functions
The m a i n  requirements o f  a
disassembler is to be able to select a
ﬁle on disk and see it as a mnemonic
code o r  a s  a n  A S C I I  d u mp .
Diskassembler allows this and more.
For a normal disassembly select a
name and the monitor will open the
ﬁle ready for your next command.

The commands available arc

the commands simple so that the
structure o f  the program can be
studied. I n  future issues e xtra
commands will be added which will

Diskassembler. Selective track and
sector (T&S) disassembly, sector

speciﬁed memory location are all
possible with very little modiﬁcation

straightforward in its use. Type it in
and press return and the current
directory will be printed direct to the
screen so that a program name can
be selected.
L"ﬁlename" will store the relevant
data to open the ﬁle ready for use with
the other commands. —
D will disassemble code from the
beginning o f the ﬁle. As each new
sector is accessed the block is stored
between $C000 and SCOFF. The ﬁrst
two memory locations are a pointer
to the next track and sector and are
stored in the next available memory
locations in the reserved SC100 to
SC2FF area so that a complete T&S
record for the ﬁle is kept for future
program modiﬁcations.
The next two bytes o f the ﬁrst
block indicates the start location for
loading the program into memory.
These values are stored at SFA for two
reasons. Fi r s tl y , i t  gives t h e
disassembler the ﬁrst memory location
for printing out the disassembly but,
when the selective disassembly unit is
added later, it also gives the base value
from which T&S disassembly can be
calculated given a  speciﬁc memory
lcoation or track and sector.
The program then enters the
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
54
disassembly section. The ﬁrst data
value is taken from location SC004 and
evaluated b y searching through a
table. Since memory saving techniques
are not required the table is a full one
for all code values. The codes are
stored in a special way to facilitate
counting through to the value of the
required b yte . T h e  method i s
analogous to the method employed by
the Basic R OM i n  the C64 when
searching for a keyword token. The
mnemonic word is stored in normal
ASCII values except fo r the last
character which is the ASCII value
plus $80. This means that the X register
can be used as a counter.
Reading up through the table, each
character is examined to  see i f the
sew th  bit is set. As this is also the
.it it means that a BPL command
can be applied to increment memory
pot-ters and continue reading. I f  a
character has a  set seventh b i t i t
indicates a negative value and the X
register is increased by one, compared
to the required value and the program
then either continues the search or
returns t o  the printout handler
according to the result.
Each mnemonic is followed by a
number which indicates how many
bytes are associated with a particular
mnemonic. The hex values o f  the
mnemonic are printed next to  the
memory location and the disassembled
code is then added, but before moving
on to the next command a  special
character dump routine is used.
Besides the disassembly there are
two columns of characters. These are
a substitute for an ASCII and screen
code dumping function. The ﬁrst
column takes the code values for that
line and prints the ASCII value. If this
value is a control code which would
disrupt the display, a fullstop is printed
instead.
The second column is created by
a routine which converts all code
values to an equivalent ASCII value
which represents the character that
would appear if the code was poked
directly to a screen location.

This facility has been included to
ease disassembly to the screen. When
a block of data is reached it can be
visually evaluated without having to
drop out of the disassemble function.
Future modiﬁcations will include both
kinds of memory dump but this should
sufﬁce for the moment.
Accessing Disk Files
A couple of features in the program
deserve explanation. One o f  the
essential functions of the program is
the ability to access disk ﬁles. This is
more involved than i n  Basic but
roughly follows the same rules.
Firstly a ﬁle must be opened. To
do this three routines are called from
the ROM - SETLFS, SETNAM and
OPEN.
SETLFS sets the ﬁle number,
device and secondary address which
corresponds with the numbers in the
OPEN 15,8,15 style of command in
Basic. To  use the function the ﬁle
number is loaded into the accumulator
(A), the device number (8) is held in
the X register and the Y register carries
the secondary address. I always try to
make the secondary address the same
as the ﬁle number because a simple
TAY command can be used to load
the Y value. It only saves one byte but
every little bit helps.
The SEINAM routine is used to
send a command or ﬁlename to the
disk drive. This correlates with the next
part o f  a  B a s i c  co mma n d :
OPENI5,8,15,"1". The command
string or ﬁlename can be stored at any
handy memory location but the system
needs to know where.
Before calling SETNAM the length
of the ﬁlename or command is loaded
into A. The low byte of the memory
location of the ﬁrst character of the
name is placed in X and Y holds the
high byte.
If no ﬁlename or command is set
it means that the ﬁle will just open
up a communication channel with the
drive ready for a command to be sent.
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G
In this case A is loaded with zero
and, because the X and Y values are
irrelevant, JSR SETNAM can be
OPEN 15,8,15 ready for a later call
of the PRINT # "I" type.
of the PRINT " I "  type.
To open the ﬁle, no parameters
have to be set in X and Y so a straight
call to the OPEN command can be
used.
When addressing a particular open
ﬁle the X register has to be loaded with
an opened ﬁle number and a channel
opened through the CHKOUT routine
for sending to a command to the disk
or CHK1N for reading from disk.
If CHKOUT is chosen, a character
is loaded into A  and CHROUT is
called to  send i t on its way. This
process is repeated for each character
until the full message has been sent
and then CLRCHN is called to free
the drive for access through other open
ﬁles. If this is not done an error will
be generated and the program will
stop.
To pull something into memory
CHRIN is called which will take the
next byte from the buffer queue in the
drive and store it in A. The character
can then be stored in memory with
some form of the STA command.
When reading the program refer to
Basic commands to  see what the
various parts are doing. These routines
are th e  ke y t o  many disk ﬁl e
manipulations, i f  you master these,
disk utilities become a piece of cake.
Even starting from Basic and using
S S  calls to these routines can create
some very powerful programs.
It All Adds Up
Addition is easy in code. First of all
the carry ﬂag is cleared and then ADC
can be applied. Clearing the carry is
important because the ﬂat is set when
the result of an addition equals a value
greater than byte maximum, 255. If
the carry ﬂag is not cleared and
happens to be set the result o f the
addition will be one higher than
expected. Try this:

40 DATA 105.01,20.210.255.96.999
The dkassembly for this is:
EDA # SOD
JSR SEED2
SEC
IDA # SOI
A IX • # Sot
JSR SEFD2
RTS
The ﬁrst two lines simply send a
carriage return to set the cursor at the
beginning of the next screen line. With
carry set, a value of one is added to
the one in the accumulator. The value
of the addition is printed to the screen
and proves that putting one and one
together doesn't always make two. If
the 56 in line 30 is changed to 24 (CLC)
the routine will give the answer two.
This is useful when incrementing
memory p o i n t e r s .  I n  t h e
Diskassembler program $FC is used
as a memory pointer. This means that
at one point $FC stores the low byte
value and WE) the high byte of the
current disassembly point in memory.
As more code is disassembled the
pointer is increased as follows:
ID A SEC
ADC # $01
STA SEC
I_DA SEE)
ADC # $00
SIA SED
If $FC is equal to 255, adding one
will set the carry ﬂag. When the zero
is added to $FD the carry ﬂag will
increase the value by one, moving the
pointer up to the next page of memory.
If SEC is at any other value, nothing
happens to the value of $FID.
The Diskassem bier includes many
othe useful pointers to programming
but its main value is its disassembling
function_

There are two factors that should prove decisive in the
ensuing conﬂict. First, there is the Skyfox II warﬁghter
with its proven technical superiorority. Secondly, but
unproven is your skill at ﬂying the beast.
Becoming the master of your machine is no easy matter
and there are ten graded missions for you to select from.
These range from minor skirmishes, to  protecting
ambassadors, destroying deathbases and ﬁnally discovering
a long lost starbase that may or may not be in friendly
hands. Completing (or failing on) a mission will bring up
an evaluation screen, showing just how well or badly you
did,
Your ship is a tricky little beast to get to grips with,
involving as it does a combination of joystick and keyboard
controls. There is a  head u p  display (HUD) on the
windscreen o f your cockpit, but i t gives only limited
information as to the range and direction of a potential
target. You still have to refer to your instrument panel to
discover if the craft is friend or foe.
An overview of the surrounding star systems can be
called up and you can select whatever heading you require.
There is an autopilot function to take the hassle out o f
navigation but - and there is always a but t h e  autopilot
takes you to your destination by the most direct route.
This unfortunately does not take into account any of the
hundreds of asteroids that are likely to lie between you
and your target. This gives you the option of ﬂying round
them manually or blasting the unwanted bits of space debris
away with your photon pulse bombs. Collision with one
of the asteroids is likely to seriously damage one of your
ship's computer systems.
A short cut through the ether of space is sometimes
available to  you in the form o f wormholes. These by-
products o f black holes act as tunnels taking you vast
distances in a matter of seconds. They are marked on the
map that accompanies the packaging, but the colour scheme
chosen (dark grey on black to avoid photocopying) renders
them almost invisible under daylight conditions and totally
invisible under artiﬁcial light_
As well as your photon bombs, you also have a neutron
disruptor laser and a supply of anti-matter mines. A deceptor
device renders you invisible to the enemy but at the cost
of large amounts of energy. Energy and weapons can he
replenished by docking at a friendly space station. Keep
an eye on your radar though as it may be necessary to
resume battle with a partially repaired ship.
Graphically, I  found the game disappointing. The
colours are fairly dull, being largely greys and blacks and
the interior of the cockpit is sparse. A few ﬂashing lights
and extra control panels, even if they had no function within
the game itself could have added to the appearance. Even
the explosions when you are blasting meteors are muted
and there are a few sprite problems here as well.
The gameplay works well though if not quite as good
as the original and anyone who enjoys the combination
of ﬂight simulators and shoot 'em-ups will ﬁnd that they
have a fair old challenge on their hands. G . R . H .
uels it seems are all the rage at the moment. After
I, why expend all that mental energy coming up
ith a new idea that may or may not work, when
you can successfully rehash an old title and bask in some
of its former glory. Cynicism apart though, the stunningly
originally titled Skvfox is a pretty good game in its own
right.
Subtitled the Cygnus Conﬂict, the game is a futuristic
combat /ﬂight simulator. You are a member of the elite
Federation Warwarriors and, as there are all sorts o f
rumours knocking about of a Xenomorph uprising, the
Federation have been put on condition alert. The general
concensus of opinion is that they are seeking total conquest
of the Terran Federation.

COMPUTER AI DED DESIGN
ell I've got good news and had news_ The good news is
W
that this book covers computer aided design (CAD) for both
the C64 and the C128. The bad news is that C64 owners will
need a Simon's Basic cartridge to get any use from the
numerous listings and the book assumes that you own a disk
drive.
CAD systems has been the buzzword in engineering
circles for several years now and with each year the systems
have become more and more complex. For those new to this
term, a CAD system is a tool which can be used to produce
standard elevation drawings of a projected new product but
the computer allows this to be taken one step further. The
design can then be displayed as a 3D object and rotated at
will to allow examination from all possible angles.
This book attempts to explain C AD  principles while
building up a useful C AD  utility program. T o do this a
compromise has been necessary by producing all of  the
Listings in Basic. The result of this is that the ﬁnished utility
runs slowly and more serious users would soon feel the need
for a machine code program.
Each chapter gently takes you deeper into the mysteries
of CAD, starting with the basic elements o f  technical
drawing. A certain amount of rudimentary knowledge of the
subject is assumed but I don't think this will be beyond most
people.
The ﬁnished program is a very powerful design tool with
many facilities to ease the problems of producing the initial
drawings. A grid which can be displayed, used and deleted.
the facility to make scale changes and zoom in on detailed
areas, mir r or  imaging, dimension scales and shading
provisions and the very essential set of erasing routines are
all available. A  very impressive range, as I'm sure you'll
agree.
Macros are produced for 3D drawings on the well-
founded assumption that all shapes can be broken down
into a ﬁxed set o f  elements: cuboids, cylinders, prisms,
cones, truncated cones, pyramids and spheres. Once
assembled the shapes can be displayed as wire frame, surface
or volume models for varying degrees of clarity. Wire frame

drawings show all of the lines which form a shape whether
normally hidden from view or not. Surface models hide all
of the lines which would not normally be visible from a
particular perspective. Volume models show hidden lines as
dashes and lies somewhere between wire frame and surface
models in terms of clarity.
Finally rotational parameters can be set to view your
ﬁnished drawing in whatever attitude you choose to select.
The book is  easy to follow and succeeds in cutting
through the jargon laden principles of CAD. The listings are
fed in gradually and I have only one small complaint in this
area. The author uses a variable II which could be mistaken
for a double < I' variable and makes debugging tedious_
Serious students and those with enquiring minds will be
entertained for many happy hours with the contents of this
book, and 1 would rate it as the best I have seen so far on this
fascinating subject.

one man's meat is another iniin's poison. With so many
commands to call upon the order in which a tutor deals with
them is fairly arbitrary as long as a thread of logic holds
them together.
Kampow starts o f f  logically work ing through the
principles of algorithms on the basis that an organised mind
is a logical mind. Then for some reason he plunges into
binary, hexadecimal and boolean operators. This is not only
confusing for  beginners but also unnecessary for  most
applications. Ev e n  s ome well-k nown mac hine c ode

If you are getting the impression that I dislike this book
you're not wholly right. Starting at chapter two the book
improves considerably. A s  each new command i s
introduced. Kampow turns it around to show the forms it
can take.
Several chapters are terminated with a series of exercises
based on the information gleaned so far. Unfortunately
there are mistakes in the answers to these problems, a
serious mistake for something that purports to be a tutorial!
One question on variable names asks the reader to decide
which variable names are legal and which would not be
accepted by the Cl28. Two legal' names are given as
WORLD$ and MONDAY, both of which contain reserved
vvords within themselves. A deﬁnite syntax error message
for this mistake!
After looking a t  arrays, th e  principles o f  ﬁle
management are given the once over. Here the fact that it is
an American edition of a German book causes one or two
problems. Because tape recorders are used as doorstops in
the States this chapter assumes that everyone owns a disk
drive. More than this, it also assumes that those who do not
own a 1541 drive must have a double sided 1571 which are
not available in the UK.
There are dozens of Basic tutorials in the shops and this
is just one of them. It has nothing to offer which can't be
found elsewhere and there are several far better tutorials
around.

About 500 of these pages are dedicated to a disassembly
of the Basic ROM routines. Each section of the disassembly
is clearly annotated with an overall description of what the
subroutine does and then detail of how this is achieved. If
Basic internals turn you on then there's fodder here to keep
you browsing for several months.
For me, the greater value of this book is the description
of how variables are stored and the stack manipulated when
various Basic routines are used.
A detailed comparison o f variable types and their
storage can help you to realise how time and memory can be
saved i f  you use the correct style o f variable in your
programs. The thorny subject of ﬂoating points variables
is tackled bravely but still requires a fair amount of head
scratching and thought before the penny ﬁnally drops.
There is a lengthy section on RAM expansion module
handling which will hold more interest for me if I ever ﬁnd a
source of RAM expansion modules in the UK.
Although C128 Basic is faily full there may be a time
when you want to  add a  new command word and
accompanying routine. A whole chapter is dedicated to this
subject with an example routine thrown i n  for good
measure, showing how a wedge can be locked into the
CHRGET routine for automatic and frequent execution.
Just before the ROM listing there is a Section on graphics
which not only shows how to switch screen and character
memory around, but also shows how Basic graphics
routines can be latched into machine code programs. I
can't think of a more suitable introduction to justify the
inclusion of the ROM breakdown on the next few hundred
pages.
This i s another excellent book from Abacus fo r
programming devotees with an understanding of machine
code. For novices the ROM routines form quite useful
examples of program routines but I would not recommend
this as a way of teaching yourself machine code.

In this section I w ill attempt to explain
the various stages in the compilation
process and how they relate to one
another. I will also explain the runtime
operation o f  a  c ompiled F C I ,
program.
The job o f  translating a source
language text into a  machine code
program is  split into a number o f
stages. These a r e  referred t o  a s

there are four distinct stages.
•  Lexical Analysis

segments arc then checked to see if any

such as function or operator symbols,
These ar e replaced b y  single-byte

stages are performed separately. I n

is checked and any errors reported.
This ensures that the programmer has
not included any illegal character or
symbol sequences. I n  addition t o
syntax error checking, the semantic
meaning of t he line is also checked and
any semantic errors reported. As the
scan progresses* a sequence of pseudo-
instructions i s  generated w h ic h
represents the operations to be carried
out. I f  the line is  error-free, this
sequence is written to an intermediate
disk ﬁle (*SFr). When the whole ﬁle
has been checked and there are no
errors, two additional data ﬁles are
created. These contain symbol (_SYM
and literal string (.1;IR) information
which w i l l  b e  us ed dur ing c ode
generation.
•  Code generation
The three ﬁles from the previous stage

are used to produce a single assembly
language source ﬁle. First, the symbol
and string data is read into memory.
Now the pseudo code is read line by
line and the assembly language source
code written to the new .ASM ﬁle. The
format of the generated program will
allow it to be LOADed and RUN as if
it were a BASIC program ﬁle.
• Assembly
A simple two-pass symbolic assembler
converts the assembly language source
code i n t o  a  machine-runnable
program. This operation is. like the
others, ﬁle based and the ﬁnished
program is contained in the ,EXE ﬁle.
There are three program ﬁles which
work together to  compile an FCL
program and Fig I  diagramatically
how they relate to one another.
COMPILE performs lexical a n d
syntax/semantic analysis. The input to
COMPILE is the source language text
ﬁle (.ECL) created using the source
editor, EDIT. Output from this stage is
the SEC, .SYM and .LTR ﬁles.
CODEGEN uses these three ﬁles to
produce the assembly language source
code ﬁle (.ASM).
ASSEMBLE is the two-pass symbolic
assembler used to produce the ﬁnal
.EXE ﬁle.
The story does n o t end here
however. In order for the .EXE runﬁle
to b e  able t o  perform the tasks
required, it needs a runtime support
library. This is the SYSLIB ﬁle which
is loaded b y  t h e  ru n u n i t a t
initialisation time. SYSLIB provides
services such as ﬁle handling and basic
I/O. SYSL IB a l so  provides a
comprehensive r u n  ti m e  e rro r
checking facility with some 15 to 20
error messages.
It i s  possible t o  e d i t t h e
intermediate .ASM ﬁle produced by
CODEGEN using EDIT. In this way,
you may make changes to the program
without re-compiling.
Theory of Runtime Operation
When the runtime ﬁle is loaded and
executed, the system pointers and data
buffers are initialised. The runtime
support library SYSLIB is loaded into
memory at $C000 and initialised. If no
library ﬁle is found, the system reports
an error and execution is aborted.
Execution of the program begins at the
Procedure Division BEGIN statement
and ends at the corresponding END
statement. Th e  structure o f  the
runtime module is determined at code
generation time and is as follows:
• BASIC  link header section and
PR O G R AMMIN G
SYS command.
• SYSL IB library loader.
• J U M P  to code BEGIN.
• Program variables.
• Program static literal strings.
• SUBROUTINES deﬁned before
Procedure Division.
• Procedure Division code.
• SUBROUTINES deﬁned vi a
FORWARD.
The BASIC link header consists of
a single line o f BASIC text which
causes execution o f the program to
occur when RUN is typed. Normally,
BASIC programs load a t address
$0801. Note that the SYS command
executes the code at this address and
must be changed if the program is to be
loaded a t any other address. This
should b e  done b y  altering th e
CODEGEN p r o g r a m  h e a d e r
generation subroutine.
Program variables differ in their
nemory requirements. Scalar integer
ypes require two bytes of storage. For
nteger arrays. the number o f bytes
required is twice the number of array
elements plus two bytes used by the
ystem. Fo r a  string variable, the
nemory requirement is three bytes
known as a  descriptor). The ﬁrst
ecords the length, the subsequent
bytes recording the string's address in
nemory. String arrays require four
bytes per element plus two bytes for
he system. These system bytes are
used to record the number of elements
n the array.
Literal strings are stored as they
ippear in the source program with an
idditional byte preﬁx recording the
ength of the string. These strings are
ermed STATIC. The memory left free
tier the program has loaded is given
ver to  the storage o f DYNAMIC
trings.
Several ze ro  page memory
°cations are used by the system at
untime f o r  special pointers and
ounters which I will call SYSTEM
ARIABLES. Numerical operations
uch as addition and multiplication are
arried out using two memory areas

• storage variable.
Many of the tasks undertaken by
the system runtime library make use of
the aforementioned variables. Even
with this much memory put aside the
system still requires some other
temporary data storage. Th i s i s
supplied by a runtime "stack" which
operates in much the same way as the
microprocessor's stack. D a ta  i s
"pushed" onto the stack or "pulled"
from it on a Last-in First-Out (LIFO)
basis. For the most part, data stored
here is the intermediate results from
numeric and string operations. The
order a n d  frequency o f  stack
operations i s  determined b y  th e
compiler a t the semantic analysis
stage. Information t o  b e  stacked
generally comes fro m the second
accumulator or descriptor. i.e AC2 or
S D I  D u r i n g  destacking. t h e
information recovered is placed in the
ﬁrst, i.e ACI or SDI. Results from
operations are returned in AC2 or
SDI Thus. operations which do not
convert data types may be represented
symbolically by:
IACII I A C 2  = > AC2 for numeric
operations.
[SDI] S D 2  >  SD2 for string
operations.
Where, represents some operation.
In some cases, AC I or SDI is not used
(for example i n  a  logical N O T
operation) hence the brackets []. For
data type conversions, the operations
are:
SD2 I > A C 2  for string to numeric.
AC2 I =  > SD2 for numeric to string.
The system library maintains the
DYNAMIC string storage area using
system variable SPTR (string pointer).
Unlike BASIC where the string stack
grows downward in memory, the FCL
stack grows upwards from the end of
the program to address $A000. As I
stated earlier, there is a problem with
string storage due to  the lack o f
garbage collection routines. When
SPTR reaches the top of memory at
SA000. the program will stop. A
garbage collection subroutine should
locate valid strings and pack them
down into low memory. adjusting
SPTR to reﬂect the new top-of-strings
address. Unfortunately, a design ﬂaw
made this impossible in the current
version. i.e. I'll know better next time.
That completes the description of
the compiler system and its language.
Next time. HI present the source text

escapes from my Commodore - the fact that I have
eventually become addicted to a computer game has
now worn thin (does she have to play it with the volume
right up - anon). Armed with joystick and Diet-Coke (some
of us have our ﬁgures to consider not like the Amiga 'Cherry-
coke' drinking reviewers I could mention!). And so the long
awaited sequel to Pacman has arrived in the form of a
horizontally scrolling platform game. The aim of the game
is quite simple (it would have to be for Sue to play it
WHACK! The cherry coke reviewer tries unsuccessfully
get his revenge).
A fairy has become lost in Pacland and it's up to Pacman
to take her back to the far side of the island, through the
magic door to Fairyland. Pacman carries the fairy under
his hat, fending off his old friends en rouse in the for
of Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde.
The ﬁrst few levels take Pacman through the hazard°
Pacland streets where you constantly have to be on the
lookout for the ghosts who try to attack in cars and plan
dropping bombs which seem to come from all directio
- so look out! Beware of travelling too slowly as you're
constantly followed by the evil purple ghost who will gobble
you up i f you lag behind, and one of your valuable ﬁve
lives will be lost.
Hitting the joystick twice to the right will give you extra
speed and height -  a must for when you come across -
yes, you've guessed it a  power pill - YIPEE! Eating this
will reverse the who-eats-who role and you can munch your
way through as many as you dare before they change from
tasty blue to hungry red, greens and yellows! Eating a few
cherries en route will top up your energy level even more,
which can be crucial, as there's nothing more annoying than
coming to a grinding halt just before you reach Break Time.
Energy is represented by a bar of withering Pacman
who will gradually diminish in size. If it runs out Pacman
will be beset relentlessly by the ghosts and a life is swiftly
lost. Don't relax too much in Break Time with the scenic
view of the, err, church (?!). The fairy appears from under
Pacman's hat for some fresh air and to award bonus points
based on the amount of energy he has left.
It's not long until you're onto the next level. Pacman
is now in the country, jumping over tree stumps, gobbling
those cherries for vital energy. But beware d o  not get
too tempted by the cherries when the ghosts are about —
it's very easy to be killed by these pac-eating ﬁends.
Following a relatively easy journey so far, now it's time
for a bit of skill to come into play. Jump over the tree
stumps again but this time there are the ghosts to contend
with as well, and they will swoop down to your level. It's
intensely annoying when you're cowardishly hiding behind
a stump, thinking they'll miss you, and then, suddenly -
WHAM (this isn't Batman, Sue - Ed) they've swooped and
knocked your brains out!

Get through this one and you've got the vertically moving
rollinglogs to contend with. Nerves of steel required for
this one balance yourself, eat those damn cherries, jump
to the next log and avoid the ghosts in planes at the same
time - not forgetting you haven't got all the time in the
world to ponder your dilemma, as the evil purple ghost
from behind will soon be upon you.

And it's here that you'll really have to be on your guard.
The hazards are basically the same, but now everything
seems to attack at once. However your skills should be
quite sharp at this point to take you home to your wife
and children, who will praise you for your bravery.
All in all, it's a lot of fun i f you've got a few hours
to spare and the patience of a Saint! The colours are, well,
colourful! and the game has an authentic cartoon feel to
it. Although the tune is catchy to begin with, it soon becomes
monotonous (I think everybody in the ofﬁce will agree,
although their choice of adjectives would not be quite as
select!).
Overall, a game which seems easy to master, but basically
isn't, and keeps you going back for that eternal one more
go, out of sheer frustration. Well, that's all folks, after all
it's nearly 6 pm...

CP/M Printer rhhamSelers
Interfacin
C
are frequently used with micro-
computers. They can be used
with the Commodore 128 by either
buying an interface unit which is
connected to the serial port, or by
connecting the printer directly to the
user port and using appropriate driver
software. The latter option is obviously
cheaper - especially i f you make up
your own lead, but has not been
available in CP/ M mode until now.
As an added bonus, since the
program uses standard resident system
extensions format, it can be used with
almost any C P/ M program that
produces printer output. There should
be no memory conﬂicts.
Connect your printer directly to the user port using
CPI M user port centronics support
How it Works
As mentioned before, the program is
a Resident System eXtension or RSX.
This is a feature of CP/ M plus not
found i n  earlier versions that is
extremely useful for allowing the pro-
grammer t o  customise system
commands.
In a  CP" M program, all inter-
action with system hardware is done
through the BDOS jump vector at
0005h (as an aside, since we are now
talking Z80 rather than 6502, hexa-
decimal numbers are denoted b y
putting an 'h' after them rather than
a •S* before). A RS X diverts this vector
so that it can examine all input/output
calls before passing them onto the rest
of the system. In this case, it looks
for printer output which it processes
itself.
Centronics protocol on the user
port is fairly straightforward. The
character data is put onto port B (pins
C to L). Then the strobe on port A
bit 2 (pin M) is momentarily brought
low to  indicate that valid data is
present to the
printer.
The computer
then waits to receive
the acknowledge
signal on ﬂag (pin B).
This allows the
printer to tell the computer
is ready to be sent more data.
Getting it all in
PR I N T ER S 0 1
when it
Two methods fo r  typing i n  the
program are shown. Which you use
will depend on personal preference and
how much additional CP/ M software
you possess. The ﬁrst one uses only
those programs supplied with the Cl28
YOUR COMMODORE july 1988
68
on the system disk and the second
requires the extra utility programs
available from Commodore.
Method 1 - listing 1 is a BASIC loader
that is typed into the computer in
normal C128 mode and a  copy is
saved. The program POKEs the Z80
machine code into an area of memory
in bank I that is not used when CP/
M is booted up. When the program
reports no errors, run it, put the CP/
M system disk into the disk drive and
type BOOT. When you see the CP/
M system prompt, insert the utilities
disk (this may be on the reverse side
of the system disk) and type SAVE.
You will then be greeted by the
system prompt again. This is because
CP/ M plus save works on exiting from
another program. So, type SAVE
again and this time you will be asked
for a ﬁlename. Type in CENT.COM
(the name is not important, but the
ﬁle type must be COM) - you are then
prompted for a start address - type
8000 - and an end address - type 8280.
The program will now he saved to disk.
Method 2 - initially you must use PIP
to copy the following ﬁles onto a single
disk: RMAC.COM, Z80.LIB and
LINK.COM fro m the additional
utilities disk; SUBMIT.COM and
GENCOM.COM from the system
disk. You will probably also need to
copy over the next editor that you use.
ED.COM will do if you have nothing
else but there are some much better
ones sitting around i n  the public
domain.
Using your text editor, type in
listing 2. This is a  Z80 assembly
language listing using th e  non-
standard OP  codes understood b y
RMAC. It should be saved to disk as
CENT.ASM. The unusual looking
data block at the beginning is the
header required to show that this is
a RSX ﬁle and not a normal program.
Then type in listing 3. This is a batch
processing ﬁle that performs all the

the
necessary steps to produce the required
CENT.COM ﬁle (plus lots of others
on the way!). This should be saved as
RSX.SUB. Once this lot is all on the
disk, type •CENT.SUB CENT and
stand back.
In Use
Contrary to the rather tortuous way
of producing the program ﬁle using
it could not be simpler. Just type
CENT. at the console. CENT.COM
is loaded into memory and the loader
checks for the RSX header. Finding
this, the program is relocated up to
the top of the Transient Program Area
and the BDOS jump vector is auto-
matically altered to point to the new
routine. Any other RSXs can he used
at the same time too.
To test, use PIP to print out a ﬁle.
Type P IP  LIST:ﬁlename where
'ﬁlename' is the name of your text ﬁles.
Note that you will need to copy PIP
onto the disk to do this.
If you use the program a lot, it is
probably worth putting it into your
PROFILESUB ﬁle on your boot up
disk so that you can forget about it.
Wiring
The lead to connect the user port to
the printer is the standard type used
by Easyscript and other programs.
These are available ready made up, or
you can follow the instructions on page
32 to make up your own.
Limitations
PR I N T ER S
Well, nothing is perfect and there are
some circumstances where the cen-
tronics output RSX will not work. The
program relies on the printer output
being via the BDOS vector. This
should be the case fo r all CP/ M
programs, but printer output can be
achieved in other ways, notably by
direct BDOS calls, and these will by-
pass the new routine. Also, redirection
of screen output by typing control P
will not work. This can be mimicked
by using PUT to produce a disk ﬁle
of screen output and printing this off
later with PIP.

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for  a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f  countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding s y s tem. T h e  c o d e ,  o r
mnemonic, is  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [ SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPCA] o r ,  exceptionally, [SSPC4 I.
Translated into English this  means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
1
This would be achieved by holding

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F 3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
ISS],[C*]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV I ]  will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode, hold down CTRL
and press t h e  number  nine k ey
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T 's  and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:

Commodore.
At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct it and

press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49152 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i t h  t h e  s ame S Y S

No system is  foolproof but the

Many o f  the listings are presented in

Our intrepid hero has been captured
by the evil Queen of the Night. Rather
than killing him outright, she offers
him one ﬁnal chance to regain his
freedom.
The Queen has two identical twin
daughters, one of whom always tells
the truth. The other one always lies.
Each of the daughters is carrying an
identical goblet, one containing a
deadly poison, the other harmless.
You will have to drink the contents
of one of the goblets. You can ask
either of the girls any one question in
an attempt to ascertain which contains
the safe potion.
How do you avoid a long lingering
death?

Bug Finder
We'd like to remind our readers that
we run a Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one of our
programs and despite much checking.
you still can't get it to run, then send
us the following:
Two copies of your program on tape
or disk.
A description of your problem.
A stamped, self-addressed envelope
for return of the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made errors and place a corrected
copy of the program back on to your
tape or disk before we return it to you.
We do get a  large number o f
queries and so it may take a while for
us to deal with yours personally.
Note: we can only deal with problems
relating to programs published in Your
Commodore.

"Yes, it's the very latest, the industry compatible Multi-font
LC-10 from Star, there are features included as standard not
found on printers sometimes twice the price...
"Well, there's the Star front control panel-so you don't have to
ﬁddle with DIP switches -
a built-in push tractor
for low form tear-off.
And you don't even
have to take the tractor
paper out to autoload single
sheetswith the LC-10's paper
parking. There's a large 4K
buffer-it's even got six NLQ fonts
as standard. It prints at a realistic
cps and has a really fast NLQ
at 30 cps".
"Hey, that sounds good, but what
about quality? You'd have logo a long
way to beat the print quality on that
MAO you've got".
"True, but they've even
improved on that
and you can change
all the resident fonts
at the touch ola
button".
