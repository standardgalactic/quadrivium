Preface
Reflector antennas have received tremendous attention because they are the most 
popular antenna candidate in satellite communications, radar applications, and as­
tronomical radio telescopes, to name a few. This has motivated significant progress 
towards the theory and design of the reflector antennas. Most of the developments 
are attributed to the evolving applications that require enhanced capability for high 
data transfer rate, antenna miniaturizations, improved radiation performances, 
low-cost implementation, light weight, easy installation, and most importantly, ease 
in the analysis and design of the reflector antennas. My motivation to work on this 
book originated from my previous research experience as a senior antenna engi­
neer at InfoMagnetics Technologies Corporation in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada 
between May 2001 and August 2006, where I was involved in the research and 
design of several reflector antenna projects for the Defense Research and Devel­
opment Canada (DRDC) and Telesat Canada. I was privileged to have numer­
ous interactions and discussions with my mentor and one of the co-editors of this 
book, Professor Lotfollah Shafai. During these discussions, we thought to compile 
a comprehensive resource for the antenna engineers and researchers on the reflector 
antennas, feed systems, and reflector applications. Considering these three thrust 
areas, we planned three volumes of a handbook in the summer of 2010. We brought 
Dr. Sudhakar Rao, who has extensive research experience with reflector antenna 
applications, on board to lead Volume III.
The purpose of Volume I is to present in-depth theory and design aspects of re­
flector antennas. The chapter contributors in Volume I are the leading experts from 
the academia and antenna industry, whose valuable experiences have added to the 
quality of this book. The book is aimed for use by practicing antenna engineers and 
researchers in the industry and academia. This book starts with an introduction to 
the reflector antennas in Chapter 1, which discusses conventional parabolic sym­
metric reflector antenna geometry, and ray tracing diagrams for some of the popu­
lar reflector antenna configurations. In Chapter 2, numerical methods used for the 
analysis of reflector antennas are presented with a significant number of design 
examples. Detailed discussion is presented on Physical Optics (PO), Geometrical 
Optics (GO), Physical Theory of Diffraction (PTD), and Geometrical Theory of 
Diffraction (GTD), in addition to, Method of Moment (MOM) and Time Domain 
Analysis for the computation of radiation performance of the single and dual re­
flector antennas. Thus, Chapter 2 builds a solid foundation for discussing the clas­
sical reflector antenna geometries and its theory and design guidelines in Chapter 3.

Preface
Chapter 3 starts with discussion on the conventional parabolic reflector geometries 
in symmetric and offset arrangements, and leads to the effects of axial and lateral 
displacements of the feed sources and beam squint. Symmetric and offset arrange­
ments of the Cassegrain and Gregorian dual reflector antenna geometries and the 
effect of blockage by feed source and subreflector are included. 
Reflector antennas with the adaptive apertures are presented in Chapter 4, 
which is based on incorporation of the multiple radiating modes based feed sources 
and control of amplitude and phase values between the modes. Reflector antenna 
performance by individually exciting the dominant TE11 mode, and higher order 
modes TM01 and TE21, one mode at a time, are discussed. This discussion will 
help the reader understand the reflector antenna performance when two modes 
(TE11 + TM01 and TE11 + TE21) are combined in different amplitude and phase 
combinations. Each combination of the amplitude and phase of the radiating 
modes refers to a specific phase center generation. Triple mode feed source is also 
incorporated for adaptive aperture generation. In addition to the waveguide based 
feed horns, a microstrip patch-based feed system is included to study the adaptive 
reflector apertures. 
Reflector shaping (Chapter 5) is used on the conventional reflector surfaces 
to achieve specific satellite coverage areas from the satellite payload reflector an­
tennas, which are generally dual reflectors in symmetric and offset arrangements. 
Both Cassegrain and Gregorian arrangements of dual reflector antennas are used. 
Single shaped offset reflectors are also used on the ground terminals. The bifocal, 
bicollimated, and multifocal dual reflector antennas are discussed in Chapter 6 
with some design examples. Advanced reflector antennas are presented in Chapter 
7, which includes discussions on the confocal reflector antenna systems, side fed 
and front fed offset Cassegrain reflector antennas, non-focused reflector antennas, 
and reconfigurable antennas. Prior to Chapter 7, we presented the most significant 
developments on the reflector antenna systems. Alternative to a reflector antenna 
is the reflectarray antenna, which must be discussed to complete the discussion. 
Chapter 8 starts with the design guidelines for reflectarray antenna and then com­
pares aperture efficiency of the reflectarray antennas to conventional parabolic 
reflectors.  Chapter 8 concludes with the discussion of different types of the reflec­
tarray antennas. 
This book presents a detailed discussion on the theory and design of the differ­
ent aspects of reflector antennas, which will serve as a handy reference book for the 
interested readers. As mentioned earlier, Volume II presents a detailed discussion 
on the different aspects of feed systems and direct radiating horn arrays. Similarly, 
Volume III offers a detailed discussion on the existing and emerging reflector an­
tenna applications. Therefore, the interested readers can find most of the signifi­
cant reference materials related to the reflector antennas, feed systems, and their 
applications in these three volumes.

1.1  Introduction
Although reflector antennas were discovered back in sixteenth century when Isaac 
Newton invented optical reflective telescopes, they did not get much attention until 
World War II. Since then, several radar applications and satellite communications 
systems have been implemented, and they have paved the way for extensive re­
search and development in this area. Reflector antennas are widely used for high-
gain applications in satellite communications, ground communications, deep-space 
communications, and radar imaging. Other high-gain antenna types include lens 
antennas and array antennas. The main advantages of reflector antennas compared 
to other antenna types are that they provide high gain and wide bandwidth capabil­
ity at relatively lower cost. Most commonly used antennas for high-gain applica­
tions are the parabolic reflectors. They convert a spherical wave illumination from 
the feed to a plane wave in the far field, with enhanced gain, narrower beamwidths, 
and low sidelobe levels. The parabolic reflector antenna is frequency independent 
and the bandwidth is limited only by the feed system. Reflector antennas generally 
come in very large aperture sizes ranging from 20λ to 1000λ and can provide very 
high gain values depending on the aperture size. Frequency of operation ranges 
from 0.2 GHz to about 600 GHz. The limitations in the frequency range arise due 
to the practical size and diffraction effects toward lower frequency and the achiev­
able reflector surface accuracy toward the higher frequency. 
Figure 1.1 shows a single spherical reflector antenna used in the world’s largest 
radio telescope located at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico [1]. The reflector 
antenna spans 1,000 ft. and was built in 1959–1963 with the Defense Advanced 
Research Project Agency (DARPA) support. The frequency ranges from 300 MHz 
to 10 GHz. Feed source uses Gregorian optics in addition to a line source feed. The 
reflector surface accuracy is 2 mm (rms). The reflector surface consists of 38,778 
perforated doubly curved aluminum panels, where each panel is of size about 
3 ft × 6 ft, supported by a network of steel cables. The feeds and receivers are 
mounted on a rotating turret within the dome, allowing rapid changes from one 
frequency band to another.

Introduction
Several excellent books have covered early developments of reflector antennas 
in detail [2–6]. However, recent developments in the past three decades have not 
been documented properly. The intent of this book is to address the latest develop­
ments in reflector antennas related to the numerical techniques, classical reflector 
geometries, adaptive reflector antennas, shaped reflectors, bifocal and bicollimated 
dual reflectors, advanced reflectors, and reflectarrays. This book volume will be 
useful for both practicing engineers as well as academic researchers. All chapters 
are written by experts in academia and industry. 
1.2  Reflector Antenna Basics
Reflector antennas typically use feed sources in symmetric or offset arrangements, 
each with certain advantages and disadvantages. One such reflector antenna in 
offset arrangement, along with its feed horn, and support structure is shown in 
Figure 1.2. Types of the reflector antennas are described by their reflector and feed 
arrangements, such as the single reflector, dual-reflector, and multiple reflector con­
figurations using conventional surface profiles or specially shaped surfaces in order 
to achieve desired radiation patterns. Path length from the feed’s phase center posi­
tion, which is placed at the focal point of the reflector for optimum performance, 
to a planar surface perpendicular to the electrical axis in front of the reflector is 
always a constant distance. Thus, all the rays normal to the planar surface are in-
phase. This is shown in Figure 1.3 where OP + PQ = constant for all rays within 
the aperture area. The reflector diameter is D and focal length is f. The half-angle 
subtended by reflector at the feed is θo, which determines the feed taper angle for 
proper illumination of the reflector surface. Focal length to diameter (f/D) ratio is 
an important parameter in determining reflector geometry. The f/D ratio is related 
to feed taper angle as follows [7]:

scope at Puerto Rico (http://www.naic.edu/).

As per (1.1), larger f/D ratio results in smaller half-angle θo. Reflector antenna 
can be analyzed using physical optics (PO) approximation [7], which can be de­
fined as follows:

where J is surface current density on the reflector surface due to the illumination by 
the feed source, n is unit vector normal to the surface, and H is the induced mag­
netic field intensity. The magnetic field intensity H is defined as combination of the 
incident field (Hi) and reflected field (Hr), both computed at the reflector surface. 
Therefore, (1.2) for the PO approximation can be rewritten as:

This current density is used to determine the radiation performance 
characteristics. 
Basically, reflector antenna performance is dictated by proper selection of the 
reflector geometry and its illumination by the feed source. Different surfaces such 
as the parabolic, cylindrical, and spherical can be used in a reflector antenna. Mul­
tireflector antenna geometries with more than two reflectors can also be realized 
to meet specific antenna radiation performance. Subreflectors are generally of 10 
to 30λ, which are integral components in dual reflector antennas. Dual reflector

Introduction
antennas can provide improved gain, aperture efficiency, and other performance 
parameters at the cost of complex geometry. The cost of implementation goes up, 
in addition to the need for a narrow beam or high gain feed source for the efficient 
illumination of subreflectors with reduced spillover loss. Dual reflectors are em­
ployed in satellite communications and in radio astronomy to achieve improved 
radiation performance including gain, sidelobe levels, cross-polarization compo­
nents, aperture efficiency, and gain to noise-temperature (G/T) ratio. The feed is 
more conveniently located for a dual-reflector antenna with reduced waveguide 
lengths and hence reduced losses. For satellite communications, reflectors are gen­
erally shaped to illuminate a particular geographical area on the Earth and meet the 
satellite coverage envelope. For multiple spot beams, a shaped reflector can also be 
excited using array of feed sources.
Ray tracing methods are very helpful for understanding and computation of 
radiation performance, and are shown in Figure 1.4 for a prime focus symmetric 
single reflector, an offset single reflector and the Cassegrain dual reflector antenna 
geometries. From Figure 1.4(a), it can be observed that all the rays from the feed 
source after interacting with the reflector surface become parallel to each and cre­
ate a plane wave situation. However, the feed source creates a blockage for the rays 
because of the symmetric arrangement, which in turn will have tendency to reduce 
reflector antenna gain and aperture efficiency. Contrary to this, in the case of an 
offset reflector antenna arrangement (Figure 1.4(b)), where feed is placed below 
the reflector, all the rays from the feed source after interacting with the reflector 
surface again become parallel to each other but without a blockage effect. Thus, it

has tendency to improve reflector antenna gain and aperture efficiency, except that 
it also causes increased cross-polarization level in the plane where reflector surface 
is asymmetric. Similarly, for the dual reflector antenna arrangement (Figure 1.4(c)), 
it can be seen that rays from the feed first interact with the hyperboloid subreflector 
surface. Consequently, rays received by the subreflector are then redirected toward 
the main reflector surface. This in turn gets reflected again forming a parallel wave. 
In this case, subreflector surface causes blockage effect, which can be corrected by 
incorporating an offset arrangement. 
A prime focus or symmetrically fed parabolic reflector antenna excited using a 
linear x-polarized Gaussian feed source of taper -12 dB is shown in Figure 1.5(a). 
A feed taper from -10 dB to -15 dB is generally preferred in practical applications. 
The frequency of operation is 12 GHz with a reflector focal length to diameter 
(f/D) ratio of 0.6. The reflector diameter, D = 1m, which equates to around 40λ 
at the design frequency of 12 GHz, where λ is free space wavelength. The half-
angle subtended by reflector at the feed, θo = 45.24°. Co- and cross-polarization 
radiation patterns of the reflector antenna for Φ = 45° cut plane is shown in Fig­
ure 1.5(b). Reflector radiation patterns are also known as the secondary patterns. 
Reflector antenna co-polarization pattern offers a maximum gain of 41.20 dBi 
at boresight angle, while cross-polarization pattern shows a deep null. The peak 
cross-polarization level in this inter cardinal plane (Φ = 45°) is around 55 dB down 
from the beam peak. In other cut-planes (Φ = 0o and 90°), these peak-cross-polar­
ization levels are extremely low because feed source is theoretical in nature. Thus, 
maximum cross-polarization occurs in only Φ = 45° cut plane. The first sidelobe 
level is around 30 dB down from the beam peak. All other sidelobe levels drop 
rapidly because reflector surface sees nonuniform illumination as one moves away 
from the center of the reflector. The far-out sidelobe level for large reflectors for 
grand station antennas need to meet the requirement of:

in order to minimize the intersatellite interference. Although not shown here, spill 
over radiation beyond the reflector edges will also appear around 115°, which will 
be discussed in detail in Chapter 2. If a reflector antenna is excited using a circularly 
polarized feed source, the reflector radiation patterns are also circularly polarized 
but suffer from beam squint. 
1.3  Feed Sources for Reflector Antennas
Feed sources are mostly waveguide horn type, but other antennas are also used, such 
as helices, cup-dipoles, Vivaldi, log-periodic arrays, and microstrip patch arrays. Both 
linearly polarized and circularly polarized feed sources are employed. Photographs of 
some feed sources designed by the first author are shown in Figure 1.6. Feed sources 
for reflector antennas are discussed in detail in Volume II of this handbook. 
1.4  Analysis of Reflector Antennas
Analysis of reflector antennas needs understanding of ray tracing and current distri­
bution on the reflector surface. Since the aperture size is much larger than any other 
antenna structure, it does need special effort to analyze and simulate the reflector 
radiation performance. Geometrical optics (GO), PO, Geometrical Theory of Dif­
fraction (GTD), and Physical Theory of Diffraction (PTD), in addition to the other 
conventional full wave analysis methods, such as the method of moments (MOM), 
are highly preferred. Some asymptotic methods that use hybridization of different 
techniques have also been developed. Ticra’s GRASP is very widely used tool, both 
in the academia and industry, to design and analyze reflector antenna performance 
with great accuracy [8].

1.5  Advanced Reflector Antenna Configurations
Conventional reflectors such as the parabolic, Cassegrain, or Gregorian are the 
simpler antenna configurations suitable for pencil beam applications. Over the past 
three decades, advanced reflector configurations have been developed for space and 
ground applications. These antennas include
••
Shaped single reflector antennas;
••
Shaped Gregorian reflector antennas;
••
Shaped Cassegrain reflectors;
••
Stepped-reflector antennas for dual-band and multiband applications;
••
Beam-waveguide reflector antennas;
••
Dual-gridded reflector antennas;
••
Large deployable mesh reflector antennas;
••
Multiple beam reflector antennas.
In shaped single reflector antennas, the surface of the reflector is shaped from 
the initial parabolic shape in order to introduce phase errors across its aperture. 
Such a nonlinear phase produces a contoured beam on the ground covering a coun­
try or a region from an orbiting satellite. Shaped Gregorian antenna in the offset 
configuration is often used for satellite communications. Here the subreflector is 
shaped for amplitude, and the main reflector is shaped for phase. With subreflector 
and main reflector arranged relative to the feed satisfying the Mizuguchi condition 
[9], very low cross-polarization levels can be achieved for linear as well as circular 
polarization applications. Shaped Cassegrain reflector antenna in the symmetric 
configuration is more often used for ground station antennas due to its compact 
size. In this case, the subreflector is shaped to minimize the gain loss due to block­
age, and the power from the feed is almost collected by the main reflector with low 
spill over and low illumination loss. The main reflector is shaped for achieving the

Introduction
uniform phase illumination at the aperture plane of the main reflector. Such a de­
sign can provide as much as 10 percent increase in the overall efficiency compared 
to a conventional reflector antenna. 
The stepped-reflector antenna [10] has been recently developed for dual-band 
and multiband applications. With proper design of the number of stepped regions 
and their step heights, almost identical beam shapes can be produced at multiple 
frequency bands. At each annular stepped region of the reflector, the phase changes 
by 180° at the higher band that results in the associated beam broadening at higher 
frequency bands. This antenna is illuminated by a single feed horn that supports 
multiple frequency bands. The beam waveguide reflector optics allow beam steer­
ing over a large coverage angle with a fixed feed horn. This antenna employs a sym­
metric shaped Cassegrain antenna with either three or four mirrors that direct the 
RF energy from the feed to the sub and main reflectors via a set of mirrors. Beam 
waveguide optics are used in Earth station antennas and also for cross-link anten­
nas in space. Gridded reflectors are widely used for satellite applications in order 
to provide dual-linear polarizations from one antenna using two shells of gridded 
reflectors that are fully overlapped (one reflector placed behind another) and fed 
with two horns, one for vertically polarized (VP) reflector and the other for hori­
zontally polarized (HP) reflector. Design of grids on the reflectors is optimized to 
improve the cross-polar isolation (typically 35 dB) between the VP and HP beams 
on the ground and is discussed in Volume III of this handbook. 
Large deployable mesh reflectors are often used for space applications. Reflec­
tors with aperture sizes of 22m and more have been developed for geostationary sat­
ellites for mobile communications and also for military applications. Use of closely 
knit mesh aperture allows a large reflector to be stowed in a small volume on the 
spacecraft during launch and deployed once the satellite is on orbit. Mesh reflec­
tors are mostly used at UHF, L-band, and S-band applications but are also used at 
higher frequency bands such as Ku-band and Ka-band with certain improvements 
to the mesh design. Another advanced application of the reflector antennas is the 
use for multiple beam applications for personal communications. This technology 
required multiple reflectors (typically three or four) with multiple feeds illuminat­
ing each reflector in order to produced interleaved beams on ground. Since these 
systems employ frequency reuse, data rates exceeding 100 Gbps are feasible with 
these advanced reflector technology. Applications and design related to these reflec­
tor antennas are treated in this volume and also in Volume III.

These equations apply to single parabolic reflector or dual-reflector Cassegrain 
or Gregorian antennas using equivalent paraboloid formulations.
However, for contoured beam or shaped beam antennas, these equations do 
not apply. For contoured beam antennas, the worst-case directivity over the cover­
age region is more meaningful than the peak directivity. Gain area product (GAP) 
is typically used for such antennas to estimate the minimum coverage area directiv­
ity. Typical values of GAP are around 18,000 and could vary in the range 8,000 to 
25,000 depending on the coverage region (area and shape). Details on contoured 
beam and multiple beam antennas are given later in this volume and also in Vol­
ume III. For multiple beam antennas, key design considerations are maximizing the 
overall efficiency, improving the co-polarization isolation among beams that reuse 
the same frequency, and minimizing the scan loss for beams that are located away 
from the antenna boresight.

commercial codes that have become industry standards with many companies 
designating them as standard tools. Chapter contents include reflector geometry 
generation using surface of revolution, geometric optics, feed modeling, reflector 
antenna analysis methods, reflector size limitations, effects of struts, dual reflector 
antennas, dual grid reflectors, and reflector coupling.
In Chapter 3, various classical reflector antenna geometries are discussed. Re­
flector antennas take many geometrical shapes—the most classical ones are the 
parabolic reflectors due to the unique optical focusing characteristics. Their dual 
configurations with the utilization of a hyperboloid or an ellipsoid as the second­
ary reflector (subreflector) are also widely used. An emphasis on design charts and 
guidelines based on numerous parametric studies has been made. Other classical 
reflectors such as plane, corner, sphere, and parabolic cylinder are also introduced. 
In Chapter 4, theory and overview of the generation of adaptive apertures is 
presented. Dual mode (TE11+TM01 and TE11+TE21) feed horns and a triple mode 
(TE11+TM01+TE21) feed horn are employed as feed sources to the symmetric and 
offset parabolic reflector antennas to adaptively illuminate it and consequently, 
generate multiple phase centers. Such an antenna is an electronically controlled 
multiple phase center antenna within a single aperture.
In Chapter 5, theory of the shaped reflector antennas and optimization tech­
niques are included. Shaped reflector antennas are heavily used as satellite commu­
nication payload antennas that tailor a specific coverage area on Earth. 
Similarly, Chapter 6 presents theory and design of dual-reflector antennas, 
which employs the concepts of bifocal and bicollimated reflector antennas to in­
crease scan capability. Such antennas are required in specific radar systems that 
must acquire and track a number of targets within a limited angular range. Further 
applications involve satellite communications systems in which highly directional 
antennas are used to cover a limited angular range. 
Chapter 7 discusses advanced reflector antenna theory and design, which in­
cludes design of confocal antenna systems, scan performance of front fed offset 
Cassegrain (FFOC) and side fed offset Cassegrain (SFOC) reflector antennas, non­
focused reflector antennas, axially displaced ellipse (ADE) reflector antennas, and 
reconfigurable reflector antennas. All of these topics address practical aspects of 
advanced reflector antennas.
Finally, Chapter 8 discusses a general overview of design methodology and 
state-of-the-art developments in reflectarray technology, which are used as alterna­
tives to conventional reflector antenna solutions. 
The reflector antenna subject has been growing steadily over the past two 
decades, mainly due to increased applications in space and ground. The antenna 
designer has to have knowledge in several areas such as advanced feed systems, 
reflector configurations, design equations/methods, analysis methods, mechanical 
aspects, system aspects, and tolerance analysis in order to realize a practical anten­
na satisfying the radiation requirements. The intent of this handbook is to provide 
most of this knowledge to the antenna engineers and researchers.

2.1  Introduction
This chapter concentrates on the use of commercial antenna analysis programs to 
predict the patterns and gain of reflector antennas. Before effective commercial 
codes were available, designers had to rely on their own codes or ones supplied 
by colleagues to analyze their designs. Today we can rely on the commercial codes 
that have become industry standards with many companies designating them as 
standard tools.
An earlier era relied on efficiency analyses [1, 2] to predict the boresight gain 
and aperture theory to predict the first few sidelobes. These analyses listed various 
efficiencies due to separable factors, such as aperture taper, feed spillover, strut 
blockage, and tolerances, which gave the designer a feeling for the importance of 
each parameter. A commercial code that produces patterns in all directions around 
the antenna gives excellent results, but by only varying design parameters can the 
designer learn the importance of each variable. The application of efficiency analy­
ses can still guide designers.
Since reflectors can be very large, the primary analysis tools are optical tech­
niques: physical optics combined with physical theory of diffraction PO/PTD and 
geometric optics combined with geometric theory of diffraction GO/GTD. The 
reader can download the student version of GRASP available from TICRA (www.
ticra.com) and learn the basics of these analyses. The download also includes [3, 
4] of this chapter. Codes initially thought to be suitable for electrically small an­
tennas—method of moments (MoM), time domain analysis (FDTD), and finite 
element codes—can either solve some reflector problems or, as a minimum, supply 
analyses of the feed including a subreflector. The commercial vendors of these pro­
grams continuously make improvements to decrease computation times by algo­
rithm improvements, the use of graphical processing units (GPUs), or out-of-core 
solutions to reduce RAM requirements. Of course, improvements in computers also 
allow for the reasonable application of these techniques once considered impracti­
cal. Different techniques have shorter or longer run times, but the most important 
consideration may be the availability of the code. No discussion of comparative

run times is given except when comparing approaches supplied in the same code 
and run on the same computer.
2.2  Reflector Geometry Using a Surface of Revolution
Surface of revolution surfaces are used in the canonical reflectors: prime focus and 
Cassegrain and Gregorian dual-reflectors, including offset versions. Given the sur­
face equation Z(r), where r is the radius from the axis, we determine the parameters 
of surface by starting with the position vector of the surface. The cross product of 
the derivatives of the position vector in the r and φ directions produces the nor­
mal vector required in physical optics analyses. Geometric optics analyses require 
knowledge of the surface radii of curvature and their principal directions. We need 
the second derivatives of the surface to compute these parameters to account for 
wave spreading. These computations can be found in geometry books.
When we describe a general axisymmetric reflector as a spline function in a 
table of (r, Z) pairs, the cubic spline expansion generates the first and second de­
rivatives of the curve used to compute the normal and local radii of curvatures. 
The equations use only the second derivative in the radius of curvature R1 in the 
r-Z plane.
Shaped reflector surfaces can be described as errors added to the canonical 
surfaces. Methods used to formulate the surface distortions use Zernike modes 
(polynomials), B-splines (bicubic), nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS), Bézier 
surfaces, quintic pseudo splines, and triangulated surfaces with smoothed deriva­
tives at vertices. All these methods use polynomial formulations whose derivatives 
can be computed exactly. These add to the position and derivatives of the canoni­
cal surfaces of revolution and produce the normal vector and radii of curvatures 
at all points. We will see that for physical optics analysis only the first derivative is 
required to compute the surface normal, while the radii of curvatures are required 
for a complete GO analysis. Method of moments analyses require only the position 
of the reflector and need neither the derivatives nor radii of curvature.
2.2.1�  Rays in a Parabola
We place the feed at the focus of the parabola and use Snell’s law with the surface 
normal to compute the reflected direction. Every ray from the focus of the parabola 
produces a ray along the z-axis when reflected. Since all reflected rays are paral­
lel, the output rays are part of a plane wave where the amplitude is constant by 
geometric optics. The amplitude along the ray decreases by 1/ρ when it propagates 
from the feed to the reflector surface and then remains constant after reflection. 
Figure 2.1 shows the ray tracing in the paraboloidal reflector with the feed located 
at the focus. This is a direct application of Fermat’s Principle. When we compute 
the reflected wave spreading for the paraboloidal reflector for the on-axis ray, it is 
a caustic where the ray magnitude is infinite for a GO analysis and a GO analysis 
will require that we apply a different technique in this angular region. 

2.3  Geometric Optics

2.3  Geometric Optics
Numerical analysis of reflectors starts with geometric optics where we use ray trac­
ing and aperture theory to analyze reflectors. This technique improves our under­
standing of the reflector antenna and gives us insight into design while serving as a 
check on the analysis.
Canonical reflectors that use conic section reflectors change the focal point of 
waves. The general conic section has two focuses when we consider that the pa­
rabola has its second focus at infinity. The ellipse and hyperbola have two focuses 
located at finite distances. If we place a feed at one focus of the conic section (a 
surface of revolution), the reflected waves spread as though they emanate from the 
second focus [2]. The two canonical dual reflectors, Cassegrain and Gregorian, 
use hyperboloid or ellipsoidal subreflectors, respectively, by locating the feed at 
one focus of the subreflector with the second focus of the subreflector coincident 
with the main reflector focus. The subreflector alters the wave spreading and in­
creases the effective focal length. These reflections are spherical waves when we 
include the plane wave as a special case. When we limit the reflectors to figures of 
rotation, such as conic sections, the radii of curvature are given by the meridians 
and parallels. Reflections from general surfaces produce astigmatic rays that have

different spreading radii in orthogonal planes. The wave planes with the minimum 
and maximum radii of curvature are called the principal planes [2]. 
With a single reflection, we need not compute the direction of the principal 
axes. We need only the focal lengths. Multiple reflections require knowledge of the 
reflected-ray principal plane directions. We account for the wave spreading in the 
principal planes for every reflection and then must compute the new directions of 
the principal planes for the reflected. We apply this method for a general reflector, 
but it fails for the paraboloidal reflector, which has a caustic reflection on boresight 
where the reflection is a plane wave with an infinite radius of curvature. For pat­
tern directions near boresight we will apply an aperture method consistent with 
GO and later use physical optics to compute the pattern near broadside. 
2.4  Feed Modeling 
We either measure the pattern of the feed or use some analytical method to compute 
its pattern. Initial analyses use analytical patterns to determine the basic character­
istics of the reflector. In many cases the exact measurement or modeling of the feed 
has little effect on the overall results because they are determined by the reflector 
geometry and interactions between various components, such as subreflectors, sup­
port struts, and edge treatments. The exact feed modeling is a secondary effect.
Consider the wave reflected into the feed by the radiation from currents excited 
on a reflector. This determines whether a full wave analysis is required. If the reac­
tion of the reflector is small, it will have little effect on the feed and we can analyze 
it in free space. When the pattern radiated from a reflector impacts the feed, we 
compute the reflection coefficient from the coupling between the reflector currents 
and the feed. Table 2.1 shows how using either larger reflectors or offsetting the 
feed of the reflector reaction has less and less effect on the feed. The reaction in­
creases for larger f/D but the effect is secondary.
Table 2.1 illustrates that a full wave analysis is seldom required and that small 
adjustments in the feed can compensate for the additional reflection term while the 
reflector has insignificant effect on the current distribution on the feed.
2.4.1  Analytical Feed Models
2.4.1.1  Gaussian Beam
The Gaussian beam arises analytically from a point source located at a complex 
point along the z-axis: z0 = -jb. Solving the Helmholtz equation for a source at this 
position produces a Gaussian distribution in the z = 0 plane.

The Gaussian beam can be solved in both the near- and far-field [2, 3] and 
produces accurate PO/PTD and GTD analyses because it is a solution of Maxwell’s 
equations from the source at the complex point. The Gaussian beam produces an 
axisymmetric pattern useful for initial reflector analyses where the polarization 
terms can be adjusted for linear polarization along the x-axis, y-axis, or either cir­
cular polarizations. The pattern approximation has an accurate near-field when the 
pattern is required in the paraxial region. 
Figure 2.2 shows the Gaussian beam feed pattern optimized to give minimum 
taper and spillover losses. Figure 2.3 plots the total illumination loss of a prime 
focus reflector given beamwidth of a Gaussian beam feed. The approximate beam­
width level relative to the feed subtended angle for minimum loss is –10 dB. Table 
2.2 lists the reflector illumination loss given beam level at the subtended angle and 
shows loss is a slowly varying function of the feed beamwidth. Narrowing the feed

beamwidth reduces the spillover lobe behind the reflector and reduces the reflector 
edge diffraction that increases wide angle sidelobes.
2.4.2  Spherical Wave Expansion Feed
A spherical wave expansion (SWE) produces accurate patterns in both the near- and 
far-field regions because it is derived from an exact solution of Maxwell’s equa­
tions. The coefficients of the expansion are obtained by matching coefficients to 
the pattern over a sphere either in the near or far-fields. These expressions are used 
in spherical near-field measurements that include probe compensation not required 
for feed modeling. As we increase the spherical measurement radius, more terms be­
come significant in the expansion. Likewise, more rapidly varying patterns require 
more terms in the SWE, since they originate from larger antennas.

The tabulated pattern can be obtained as a series of great circle patterns mea­
sured on an antenna range or obtained from the analysis of the feed using small 
electrical size methods such as MoM, FEM, or FDTD. Analytical models of simple 
antennas, such as horns that use aperture methods, can be reduced to a SWE and 
produce accurate near-field patterns. These are useful when reflectors are in the 
near-field of the feed instead of using the incorrect far-field pattern. When using 
measured patterns, multipath errors of the pattern range can be reduced by limit­
ing the number of terms in the spherical wave expansion to eliminate chamber wall 
and positioner reflections. 
2.4.3  Currents Expansion Feed
A MoM solution produces a feed whose currents are computed over an extended 
surface. Similarly, a physical optics analysis also generates currents on a large sur­
face, such as a reflector, and can be used as a feed for PO or GTD analyses on 
another reflector. When computing the field on the next object, the radiation from 
the currents on an extended feed can be summed before reacting with it. However, 
the GO/GTD calculations depend on ray tracing including incident direction. It is 
necessary to consider each current element of the feed as a separate source and the 
ray from each point on the extended feed needs to be found. The usual method is to 
initiate this attribute when the next operation is a GO/GTD computation. 
2.5  Reflector Analysis Methods
2.5.1  Aperture Method
Aperture method uses a flat projection of the reflector and integrates the incident 
field across this aperture to compute the radiated field. The analysis directly relates 
the aperture fields to a radiation pattern of the feed and produces computations 
on the feed pattern independent of the electrical size of the reflector. We use this 
analysis to evaluate the characteristics of the feed pattern and determine various 
tradeoffs between various feeds or geometries of the reflector. The Huygens source 
approximation replaces the incident fields on an aperture with equivalent electric 
and magnetic fields whose ratio is determined by a free-space plane wave; that is, 
the characteristic impedance of free-space. The pattern from the aperture is com­
puted by using a two-dimensional Fourier transform of the aperture fields.

When apertures are large, we can ignore this pattern factor. In (2.1) f(kx, ky) is 
a vector in the same direction as the electric field in the aperture. Each component 
is transformed separately. The far-field components Eθ and Eφ are found by projec­
tion (scalar products) from f(kx, ky) times the pattern factor of the Huygens source 
(2.2). 
Planar near-field measurements of a reflector compute the pattern by measur­
ing the aperture fields and using the Fourier transform. If the measurements are 
on a rectangular grid, a dual axis discrete Fourier transform or FFT computes the 
complete pattern in a single operation. Similarly a Fourier-Bessel transform over a 
circular aperture can be used with plane polar measurements. Equation (2.1) com­
putes only the shape of the pattern. The planar near-field measurement requires a 
measurement of a gain standard to obtain the absolute pattern level. The aperture 
method requires a similar calibration that consists of determining the input power 
of the feed. Next, we consistently repeat this operation for all analyses in that we 
compute the input power of the feed by either integrating its pattern or by de­
termining the input power from a circuit model in the method of moments. The 
feed input power can be also be determined from the feed antenna gain, whether 
measured or computed over an aperture, such as in finite difference time domain 
(FDTD) where the fields are computed at a single frequency on a box enclosing the 
model.
We can calculate radiated power by integrating the Poynting vector magnitude 
over the radiation sphere, but there is an easier way. We assumed that the aperture 
fields are free-space waves. The total power radiated in the aperture is,

Figures 2.4 and 2.5 give the aperture distribution computed from the physical 
optics currents on a 20λ diameter reflector including Physical Theory of Diffraction 
(PTD) rim terms at a plane just outside the focus. The greater distance to the rim 
compared to the reflector axis increased the amplitude taper of the feed in the edge 
direction by 2 dB. Notice that the amplitude is continuous at the edge (10λ), while 
aperture theory makes the region larger than the edge radius zero. The cylindrical 
boundary along the last ray reflected from the rim has no physical discontinuity, 
and the field must be continuous across this fictitious boundary. The field ampli­
tude drops by 6 dB as it crosses the edge radius to make the field continuous.
Figure 2.5 illustrates the small phase ripple in the aperture due to the finite 
reflector size. At a radius greater than the rim (10λ), the phase starts cycling and ap­
proximately cancels when integrated. Figures 2.4 and 2.5 are not the distributions 
integrated for the aperture method, but it is one with a smooth amplitude variation 
at a radius less than the rim radius and zero beyond. Likewise the phase is assumed 
to be constant. For example, a planar near-field measures a distribution similar to 
these curves but is extended out to an angle determined by the distance from vertex 
to the measurement plane to produce accurate patterns. 
An aperture method using the projected rim of the reflector produces accurate 
patterns at the beam peak and the first few sidelobes. Normally this GO analysis 
is extended to larger angles by using Geometric Theory of Diffraction (GTD) that 
considers the rim diffractions. GTD is able to produce accurate patterns from the 
Figure 2.4  Aperture distribution of 20λ diameter reflector computed from PO analysis.

near-boresight sidelobes all the way to backlobe. GTD is, however, unable to pre­
dict the main beam level or the exact last backlobe. Early GTD prediction programs 
used the aperture method for angles near boresight and then attempted to match 
the two methods at some angle off broadside. Because the GO aperture method is 
an approximation to the real aperture distribution given by Figures 2.4 and 2.5, the 
two methods failed to match and there was a discontinuity that would be ignored.
2.5.1.1  Blockage Losses
A complete GO analysis includes the central feed or subreflector blockage plus the 
blockage of struts used to support the feed or subreflector. Struts that connect to the 
reflector interior rather than to the rim block the feed pattern, and we must project 
the feed through them to determine the portion of the main reflector shadowed and 
eliminated from the aperture integral. Struts block the plane wave reflected from 
the main reflector and reduce the aperture distribution. In a GO analysis of the 
antenna, we sum the contributions from these two blockages, which often over­
lap. The radial connection point of the struts is a compromise between mechanical 
strength and total blockage. 
Thin struts less than 3λ in diameter have greater effect on the pattern than their 
projected area. These effects are accounted for by using the induced field ratio (IFR) 
factor that increases the effective area of the strut. Think about a thin wire that 
has currents excited on it when placed in an incident wave. Even an infinitesimal 
wire will have currents flowing on it and we must use an effectively larger blockage 
than the strut area to account for this. A physical optics analysis that deals with 
the radiation from currents excited on objects has a similar factor to deal with this 
problem: induced current ratio (ICR). When the strut has small cross section, these 
factors become significant (less than 2λ); the actual shape of the cross section has a 
secondary effect and a circular strut is substituted in the analysis. Larger struts with

arbitrary cross section can be analyzed using 2D MoM to determine their complex 
scattering or a PO surface scattering plus a PTD edge scattering from corners.
2.5.2  PO Analysis
An incident wave excites currents on the surface of a metal object so that the com­
bination of the incident fields and the radiation from the surface currents null the 
field on the opposite side of the object.

Later we will consider semi-transparent surfaces where the reflected wave does 
not equal the incident wave. Given the currents on an object, we compute the radi­
ated fields using the dyadic Green’s function valid both in the near- and far-field. 
This Green’s function requires integration over the induced currents in which a 
practical implementation uses a meshing of the surface. 
The integration of the dyadic Green’s function times the current on a surface 
is independent of the method used to find them. They could be computed by PO 
or by MoM, but the radiation is determined by integration. If the surface has been 
divided by a triangular or square mesh and the integration is performed on this 
grid, the product of the first spatial derivatives of the current times the increment 
length gives the integration error on this pulse distribution. When the radiated field 
changes rapidly, either with angle or position, a finer mesh is needed to reduce 
error. This means that computations of the pattern near broadside of a reflector, 
where the integrand changes slowly, require few sample points on the reflector 
to achieve low error. Analysis of the pattern at angles far from boresight requires 
more and more sample points to achieve low errors. Using Gaussian-Legendre in­
tegration on the sample points reduces the number of points required because the 
error is proportional to the 2nth derivative of the integrand for n sample points. 
For a circular aperture found in many analyses of reflectors, the radial integration 
spacing uses Gaussian-Legendre integration. If the polar integration meshing is uni­
form in φ, the outer region points are too widely spaced, while the inner points are 
too close together for efficient integration. The solution to this problem spaces the 
polar points proportional to the radius. Outer circles have more sample points than 
inner circles. The combination of Gaussian-Legendre radial integration, where the 
integrand changes rapidly for wide pattern angles with proportional polar sample, 
produces much lower integration error than the equally spaced mesh sampling. 
The equally meshed surface requires more points to achieve the same accuracy. The 
commercial code GRASP (TICRA) uses the Gaussian-Legendre radial integration 
and a convergence optimization on the number of points in the integral to produce 
accurate patterns without user intervention.

version of GRASP (TICRA) for various analyses generated from few parameters in 
an input wizard. The reflector consists of a parabola with focal length of 10λ whose 
extent is determined by a 20λ diameter rim function. A Gaussian beam feed is 
placed at the focus and rotated to point at the reflector vertex by a feed coordinate 
system relative to the reflector vertex (global coordinate system). After the wizard 
creates the file to store the PO currents, we can edit this object to set or not the in­
clusion of PTD edge radiation to give the two conditions shown on the graph. The 
program automatically selected a feed reflector edge taper of –12 dB that Table 2.2 
shows gives an insignificant 0.05 dB less gain than a –10 dB taper based on aperture 
theory. The pattern angular extent is defined in a field storage object and used in the 
automatic convergence algorithm to select the number of integration points on the 
reflector to compute an accurate pattern at all angles. If the maximum pattern angle 
was less than 180º, the number of points on the surface for PO field integration and 
the number of PTD points along the rim would be less. 
GRASP has a command line structure that steps through the operations. For 
example, the first operation computes the PO currents on the reflector and the 
PTD rim currents (if specified in the PO storage object) or applies a convergence 
algorithm to select the number of integration points to produce accurate values 
over the specified output pattern space. PO analysis attempts to null the fields be­
hind an object radiated by the feed antenna by inducing currents on the reflector 
surface. When computing the total field, the radiation from the feed and induced 
current are summed. The solid curve in Figure 2.6 gives the complete analysis when 
summing all components. The short dashed curve illustrates the result of ignoring 
the PTD radiation. PTD only significantly affects the low sidelobe pattern region 
and sidelobes near the backlobe. The absolute level of the backlobe (180º) is the 
same with or without the PTD term. If we exclude the direct radiation from the

feed (long dashed curve), the pattern in the front region (to 60º) is the same as for 
the full analysis. In the backlobe region behind the reflector we see the pattern of 
the feed except for the added ripple caused by the edge. This is the radiation of the 
currents induced on the reflector attempting to null the field behind it. Of course, 
since it has a finite electrical size, the level of extinction is limited. Later we will 
consider the GO/GTD solution where the reflector blocks the feed radiation and 
the backlobe pattern region is computed entirely by using edge diffraction on the 
rim. The lobe peaking at about 115º is the spillover lobe caused by the feed radia­
tion passing over the reflector rim.
Figure 2.7 plots the H-plane response of the 20λ diameter reflector. This plane 
has lower ripple across the spillover lobe compared to the E-plane pattern. The 
sidelobes near the angle of the backlobe are lower in the H-plane than the E-plane, 
another general characteristic of a reflector fed with a linearly polarized feed.
Figure 2.8 plots the E-plane pattern when the reflector is fed by a far-field 
forced analytical feed (or interpolated measured fields) using GRASP (PO/PTD). 
The pattern behind the reflector from 120° to 180° is significantly different from 
the near-field Gaussian beam analysis given in Figure 2.6. This illustrates the im­
portance of using a near-field source when computing patterns in these regions. 
GRASP converts interpolated measurements and feed models such as horns to a 
spherical wave expansion that generates accurate near-field patterns and produces 
accurate patterns behind the reflector. The results of analyses of large reflectors 
have smaller errors when using the far-field pattern of the feed. 
Figure 2.9 illustrates the effect of using pulse integration when computing the 
Green’s function for the far-field pattern of a simple axially symmetric 20λ di­
ameter reflector for finer and finer meshing. The currents across the patches are 
constant (pulses). Increasing the number of meshing points has little effect on the

results for this small reflector. Figures 2.6 and 2.9 show little difference in the front 
hemisphere, but at angles beyond this there are significant differences and the lobes 
are poorly formed. The pulse integration causes these errors and decreasing the 
mesh size has no effect. Repeating the analysis using the PO technique of Diaz and

Milligan [5] showed the same result. The error of pulse integration is proportional 
to the first derivative of the Green’s function. In this pattern region the Green’s 
function derivative is large. GRASP uses Gauss-Legendre integration whose error is 
proportional to the 2nth derivative where n is the number of points in the integra­
tion interval and produces much lower error.
Physical Theory of Diffraction 
This analysis includes PTD and shows that adding PTD only affects the computed 
pattern in low radiation level directions. The extra PTD radiation terms arise from 
edges because PO computes currents on the surface assuming an infinite surface. 
At edges PTD accounts for the current discontinuity by adding equivalent edge cur­
rents. We compute the PTD radiation by using a line integral of these currents along 
the edges for the Green’s function and add this radiation to the PO current radia­
tion. Readers familiar with GTD will recognize the similarity with edge currents 
used in the alternate formulation of GTD diffraction where the pattern is computed 
using line integrals of those currents. The field computed behind an object, where 
the direct radiation is blocked in the GO/GTD formulation, is found completely 
from the radiation of these currents. PO/PTD includes the “blocked” radiation and 
the surface currents on the blocking object to compute the fields behind a blocked 
object. The PTD additional radiation is much smaller than the GTD term that pro­
duces the complete radiation in the blocked region.
The PTD currents depend on the incident wave direction. We need to account 
for the position of the source of radiation for extended radiators. A GRASP for­
mulation requires the additional storage of rays from the extended radiator, and 
the computation time increases significantly. Of course, the example of the 20λ 
diameter reflector has its radiation source from a single feed, and it is not needed. 
The computation of the Poynting vector from the incident field radiated from an 
extended source can be used for the direction of incidence. This produces accurate 
PTD radiation relative to the sum of radiation terms in a PO/PTD computation. It 
is a simple task to check the effect by adding ray storage in GRASP for an extended 
source that switches the technique to individual rays instead of the composite ra­
diation. The number of edge currents increases in the automatic convergence when 
the far-field pattern range is increased or a near-field convergence over a larger 
secondary scatterer is requested. 
Scattering from polynomial cross section struts uses PTD to compute the scat­
tering from the various edges illuminated by the source elements. Similarly, field 
scattered from gaps in a reflector are computed using the PTD scattering from each 
edge. Similar to strut blockage, a constant width gap is used for very narrow gaps 
instead of the actual value because a narrow slot radiates independent of its width 
like the thin wire of a strut. Although PTD is a small term in the sum of fields radi­
ated by a reflector antenna, it should be included in all analyses using PEC surfaces.
Feed Blockage of Single Reflector
We ignored the scattering from the feed for the analyses. Table 2.1 shows that the 
reaction of the reflector is quite small on the feed antenna, which means the cur­
rents excited on a reflector do not modify the currents on the feed antenna, nor 
do they have much significance to its impedance properties. The extra reaction 

28 
�����������������������������������對
Numerical Techniques for Reflectors
(coupling) adds another term to the reflection coefficient and produces a ripple in 
the frequency response of return loss.
This isolation allows computation of currents on objects while ignoring the 
coupling. If the analyst believes the various parts have significant reaction, an it­
erative PO/PTD can be applied where the excited currents are allowed to radiate 
and excite another set of currents on the source. Since electromagnetic fields are 
linear, we can add the fields radiated by these new sources to the existing fields. The 
program GRASP allows the use of currents excited on scatterers as sources. The 
feed in an axisymmetric reflector will block the radiation from the main reflector. 
Later we will discuss the support struts that also cause significant scattering. The 
student version of GRASP10 was used to analyze this case, by placing a 1.5λ × 1.5λ 
rectangular plate at the mouth of the feed to approximate the size of the Gaussian 
beam for the 20λ diameter reflector with f/D = 0.5. The following steps are used:
1.	 Illuminate the reflector using the Gaussian beam feed to generate currents.
2.	 The currents on the main reflector radiate and induce currents on the 
blocking plate.
3.	 Compute the radiated field using the combination of the Gaussian beam 
feed, the main reflector currents, and the feed blockage currents.
4.	 Use the blocking plate currents to illuminate the main reflector because it 
will block the radiation in the backlobes from this secondary source.
5.	 Add the radiation from the new set of main reflector currents to the radi­
ated field.
Figures 2.10 and 2.11 give the E- and H-plane patterns of this analysis. With­
out the main reflector blockage currents, the back lobe angular region shows

significant sidelobes and the forward hemisphere has smaller sidelobes. The H-
plane pattern has higher forward hemisphere sidelobes spread out over the whole 
region than the E-plane. 
2.5.3  GO/GTD Analysis
A geometric optics analysis traces rays through their many reflections to the far-
field. The method fails when the beam reflected collimates to form a plane wave. 
At that angle the reflected wave becomes infinite and the analysis cannot be used. 
Objects block the GO wave radiation unlike the PO analysis where waves pass 
through these objects. Radiation from induced currents is used to analyze the wave 
blockage in PO. GO sets the direct wave to zero when it is blocked. We compute 
the pattern behind blocked objects by using diffracted waves that scatter at edges 
or creep around smooth objects while continuously shedding rays. 
Most reflectors can be solved using GO and edge diffractions. These edge dif­
fractions occur at blocked boundaries due to the GO ray discontinuities in both 
amplitude and slope (slope diffraction). Along each edge we have two boundaries 
where the last reflected ray occurs (reflection boundary) and a shadow boundary 
where the last ray is transmitted. These boundaries are only mathematical entities 
in space and not physical boundaries. Since these are nothing but free space, the 
fields must be continuous across them. Uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) [6] 
was developed to produce functions that increase when approaching from both 
sides of this boundary and have a discontinuous derivative at the boundary. The 
combination of the GO waves and the diffraction coefficient terms produce a 
smooth transition across the shadow and reflection boundaries.

Numerical Techniques for Reflectors
The first GO/GTD computation tools developed for reflectors used an aperture 
analysis to compute the pattern for the main beam and the first few sidelobes. At 
angles beyond the first few sidelobes, GTD was used. In the front hemisphere the 
pattern was determined primarily by the reflection boundary diffraction coeffi­
cient while the rear hemisphere used the shadow boundary diffraction. Of course, 
all pattern points in the GTD region were the combination of both terms. Only 
two edge diffractions are required for a simple elliptical rim reflector and the pat­
tern calculations are extremely quick in these regions (most of the angles) and run 
time is independent of reflector size. The problem with this technique was the GO 
analysis. Since it is only approximate, the two techniques would be discontinuous 
where they met. The solution to the problem is to use PO/PTD for the first few sid­
elobes and compute the majority of the pattern using GTD. When using a near-field 
Gaussian beam or SWE, the fields satisfy the Helmholtz equation and are exact, 
which produces identical results in PO/PTD and PO/GTD analyses.
Figure 2.12 shows the E-plane pattern for a 2000λ diameter reflector where 
the main beam and approximately the first four sidelobes are computed using PO/
PTD, while all other pattern angles use GTD. GRASP uses widely spaced aperture 
points because few are required where the derivative of the Green’s function is 
small and the PO analysis has a short runtime for the large reflector. Of course, the 
program does an automatic convergence search to determine the number of inte­
gration points for PO/PTD. The GTD analysis sums diffractions (edge plus slope 
diffraction) from two edge points and has a run time independent of the reflector 
size. Millions of pattern points are computed quickly using GTD.
We can compare the GTD analysis in Figure 2.13 of the E- and H-plane for 
a 20λ diameter reflector with the PO/PTD analysis (Figures 2.6 and 2.7) and see 
that they match exactly. The transition between the PO/PTD and the GTD pattern

regions is smooth with the sidelobes following a similar smooth transition. Notice 
the small discontinuity at about 116° in the E-plane pattern (Figure 2.13). This is 
due to a creeping wave term not included in the analysis. The discontinuity shrinks 
as electrical size of the reflector increases. Optical methods like GTD may have 
small discontinuities that we can ignore because they only affect narrow pattern 
regions and do not extend over a large pattern range. 
2.5.4  Shooting and Bouncing Analysis
Shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) can be thought of as a hybridization of geo­
metrical optics and physical optics. Many GO rays are launched from the trans­
mit antenna toward the scattering geometry, thus determining which surfaces are 
directly illuminated. The GO rays launched by the feed are vector-field weighted 
by the antenna and represent diverging volumetric ray tubes that “paint” surface 
currents on the platform according to the GO boundary condition (i.e., PO cur­
rents). These currents radiate to far-field observation angles, near-field observation 
points, or receiving antennas to generate the scattered field contribution. Next, a 
set of reflected rays is generated from the first-bounce hit points. Their vector fields 
are updated according to GO and the material properties of the reflecting surface. 
Some of the reflected rays escape, while the remainder hit other surfaces of the CAD 
model painting second-bounce currents. The process is continued, and in this way 
SBR implements multibounce scattering. If penetrable surfaces are encountered by 
the rays, then transmission rays are also generated in addition to the reflection rays. 
Hence SBR uses GO to efficiently extend traditional PO, which is applicable only to 
single-bounce convex shapes, to multiple bounces, and arbitrary shapes [7].

Numerical Techniques for Reflectors
Ray techniques, like the shooting and bouncing analysis, run very fast because 
no matrix is generated or inverted. The method computes the scattering from com­
plex structures, such as ships, airplanes, and spacecraft, that consist of many reflec­
tions, but it can also be used to analyze reflectors.
A 20λ diameter reflector was analyzed by using Savant (Delcross), a unique 
shooting and bouncing rays program. The analysis used an analytical feed of a 
Gaussian beam and produced the E- and H-plane patterns of Figure 2.14 that 
shows the characteristic E-plane ripple in the spillover lobe for a far-field source. 
The H-plane pattern has a smooth spillover lobe with a response generally similar 
to the E-plane. The H-plane has a small discontinuity at 90° due to a blockage-
checking algorithm associated with the PTD wedge correction algorithm used by 
Savant. These small discontinuities that occur in GO/GTD analyses have no effect 
on the results nearby and can be ignored.
CST implements the SBR in their A-solver (asymptotic) and can also generate 
patterns from a reflector using a far-field feed pattern. 
2.5.5  Moment Method Reflector Analysis
The method of moments can be extended to larger and larger structures with larger 
computer RAM, out-of-core solvers, graphical processing units (GPU), and appli­
cation of the multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM) [8, 9]. A matrix must 
be either inverted or solved by some iterative method to produce the currents on 
scatterers. Of course the iterative solution, such as MLFMM, may not converge. If 
the matrix has a low enough condition number, an iterative inversion may be tried 
instead of the computationally expensive LU decomposition. The problem size can

be reduced by using symmetry generated by polarization, and the model may be 
reduced to only 1/4 its original size by using electric and magnetic walls.
Most MoM codes solve the complete problem by generating a model that in­
cludes the reflectors, scatterers such as support struts, and an electric model of the 
feed. After we obtain the currents using a MoM solution computed by inverting 
either the matrix (LU decomposition) or an iterative technique, all interactions and 
blockages have been included. Since the interactions are small, MoM codes can 
use interacting hybrid MoM/PO solutions where PO currents react on the MoM 
currents or a MoM solution feeding a PO model of the reflector can obtain ex­
cellent results [10]. The combination of the smooth reflectors and the distance 
between the feed and multiple scatterers produces problems that usually converge 
when using MLFMM in a MoM code. Similarly a time domain model using FDTD 
or a FEM model includes the feed and the reflectors to generate the interactions, 
but also includes the empty space between scatterers and radiation sources in the 
computation. 
The combination of the feed and reflector can be separated by using a hybrid 
MoM/PO [10], where the PO elements have the same meshing and expansion as 
the MoM (e.g., roof-top basis functions as used in FEKO). The hybrid technique 
requires wire elements to be associated with the MoM portion while the separation 
boundary between the two solutions can be arbitrary. The two hybrid techniques 
vary in the amount of coupling between the PO and MoM regions. In the simplest 
case the PO does not react on the MoM solutions and the currents on the MoM 
solution radiate and excite currents on the PO region. This is the type of analysis 
contained in GRASP with its MoM add-on. 
Roof-Top Basis Function Analysis
Figure 2.15 gives the results of a moment method analysis (FEKO) of the 20λ di­
ameter reflector using the MLFMM algorithm to speed the analysis. The MLFMM 
analysis converged easily for this smooth structure. Because the program uses 
roof-top basis functions on flat triangles, its integration of the Green’s function is 
approximately triangular, and the integration error is proportional to the second 
derivative of the Green’s function. This produces lower error than using pulse in­
tegration of the FEKO PO analysis. There is little difference between Figures 2.6 
(GRASP PO) and 2.15 (FEKO MoM) until the lobes beyond the spillover lobe 
where the use of a far-field source has increased the error. 
Higher-Order Polynomial Basis Function Analysis
WIPL-D uses a series of polynomial terms in two directions along the axes of bi­
linear patches to approximate the currents. These higher-order basis functions [11] 
allow patches as large as 2λ on a side instead of the recommended λ/10 size for 
roof-top basis functions to produce accurate results. The bilinear patch has straight 
lines on each side, but the patches do not have to be flat. Of course, the higher order 
basis functions produce smaller matrices, but each one contains more terms and 
needs greater storage than roof-top basis functions. Of course, the small triangular 
patches model the surface more closely than the larger bilinear patches, and the 
higher order method may require more than the minimum of 2λ on a side to reduce 
modeling error.

Numerical Techniques for Reflectors
Figure 2.16 gives the E-plane analysis of the 20λ diameter reflector fed with 
analytical Gaussian beam feed. Figures 2.15 and 2.16 of the two moment method 
solutions using an analytical feed are very similar. When a small rectangular horn 
is used as a feed, WIPL-D produces a pattern (Figure 2.17), similar to Figures 2.10 
and 2.11 for a PO/PTD analysis for a reflector that has a rectangular feed block­
age. The rectangular horn model produces correct near-field illumination of the 
reflector. The horn blocks the radiation from the main reflector and increases the 
near-in sidelobes, while the main reflector shields the backlobes. Of course, the 
MoM code solves the problem as a whole, which involves a single matrix inversion 
to compute all currents. Notice that when a real model of the rectangular horn is 
included in the MoM model, the backlobes are clean because of the accurate near-
field radiation from the feed. Note other MoM codes, such as FEKO and CST I-
solver, produce similar sidelobes in the region past the spillover lobe when feeding 
the reflector with a MoM source. This is due to the correct near-field pattern of the 
feed modeled in MoM. Although the solution matrices of Figures 2.16 and 2.17 are 
smaller than a roof-top triangular meshing solution, some distortion can happen 
due to the use of large nearly flat facets on the reflector in the analysis. 
Higher-Order Legendre Polynomial Basis Function MoM Analysis
Another higher-order polynomial basis function code uses a series modified Legen­
dre polynomials (GRASP) along each axis of a patch to approximate the currents 
[12, 13]. This method uses curved patches that more nearly follow the shape of re­
flectors. Similar to WIPL-D higher-order basis functions, the GRASP MoM can use 
patches up to 2λ on a side and produce accurate results. By expanding the currents 
in modified Legendre polynomials nearly mathematically orthogonal, the matrices

have many orders of magnitude lower condition numbers than the series of poly­
nomial terms basis functions [12], which allows iterative solutions of the matrix 
in most cases. However, for ill-conditioned matrices, GRASP will revert to the LU 
decomposition automatically.

Numerical Techniques for Reflectors
A GRASP MoM analysis of a 20λ reflector using a far-field forced (Gaussian 
beam) feed shows a similar response in the back lobe region as other methods 
(Figures 2.8 and 2.15). When the near-field Gaussian beam similar to the SWE of 
a measured feed is used, Figure 2.18 shows a pattern that looks like the pattern 
response of Figure 2.6. Figure 2.18 also illustrates the effect of a feed blockage, 
which is quite similar to Figure 2.10 of a blocked reflector using PO/PTD analysis.
BOR MoM Analysis
The program CHAMP (TICRA), used to design corrugated and other circular 
horns, includes a body of revolution (BOR) MoM to analyze reflectors. Figure 2.19 
is a BOR MoM analysis of a 20λ diameter reflector fed by a scrimp horn [14] de­
signed by CHAMP to produce the correct feed taper for this f/D. In both cases the 
pattern includes the feed blockage.
Time Domain Analysis
Time domain analysis becomes more and more practical as a reflector analysis 
tool such as a graphical processing unit (GPU) is applied to time stepping. The 
GPU consists of many parallel processors initially designed to handle scene genera­
tion for graphics. Time domain analysis can handle dielectric regions directly while 
MoM solutions must rely on a surface electric and magnetic current equivalence 
surrounding the dielectric body [11].
Figure 2.20 illustrates the pattern response of a 20λ diameter reflector fed by 
a scrimp horn using the CST time-domain solver. The analysis includes the feed 
blockage because it is part of the full analysis. This response is similar to the other 
techniques given earlier and shows the applicability of this technique to reflectors.

It is interesting to observe the time response of the horn and reflector combination 
and see the separate sinusoidal modulated Gaussian pulses of the feed and the time 
delayed reflection from the main reflector because it shows a level matching Table 
2.1.

Numerical Techniques for Reflectors
An important use of the time-domain analysis is prediction of a feed and subre­
flector combination that involves dielectric support structures. The output provides 
input to analyses of very large main reflectors using PO/PTD when the pattern is 
expanded in a SWE to account for the finite feed size. Of course, the blockage of 
the subreflector and feed must be included in the PO/PTD analysis as separate 
items. As computer processing improves, or when just used for smaller problems 
today, a time domain solution can handle the complete model and is a useful tech­
nique for reflector analysis.
CST has an integral solver (MoM) that produces similar patterns to the time 
domain solver. The input CAD is the same for both the time domain and integral 
solvers so it is easy to switch solvers. The solution method can be selected after 
geometry input. When modeling a complex feed like the scrimp horn a closer mesh 
may be required on the feed. A simple horn like the rectangular horn used in the 
WIPL-D example has a mode with definite symmetry planes that when applied 
reduces the model size by one-fourth. When possible, these symmetry planes en­
able the solution of much larger reflectors in reasonable run times and computer 
storage.
2.6  Reflector Size Limitation 
An offset reflector was analyzed using GRASP to determine the size limit of a re­
flector. A Gaussian beam feed was used for all cases, and it was placed so that it 
would not block the reflector aperture. By changing the geometry of the horn and 
reflector in each case, we can eliminate the direct horn aperture blockage of the 
reflector. A circular disk placed at the aperture of the horn with currents excited by 
the radiation of the reflector currents simulated the horn blockage. The feed spill­
over produced a large lobe in the positive pattern region, while the horn blocked 
radiation on the negative side of the patterns in the offset plane. Using a central 
feed horn with a symmetric reflector would cause significant blockage, as diameter 
is decreased, and would produce a useless design. Of course, these antennas have 
significant cross polarization in the symmetric plane of the offset fed reflector, but 
we can still determine the limits of reflector size.
Figure 2.21 shows the geometry of a 10λ diameter offset reflector. It has a focal 
length of 5λ and the feed has a beam taper of –12 dB at the rim of the reflector. The 
feed was located out of beam radiated from the reflector to reduce the coupling

from the currents on the reflector radiating into the far-field by having the last ray 
pass λ/2 from the horn aperture.
A circular plate placed in the aperture accounted for the scattering of the field 
radiated from the reflector. Its diameter is 0.5λ larger than the minimum waist of 
the Gaussian beam. This circular plate scatterer reduces the pattern along the –x 
axis.
The Gaussian beam feed accounts for near-field radiation when the reflector 
surface is sufficiently close to merit the expansion. GRASP feeds can be forced to 
use the far-field approximation. Figure 2.22 illustrates the pattern differences when 
using the near-field approximation on a 10λ diameter offset reflector solved with 
both PO/PTD and MoM. The PO/PTD (long dashes) and MoM (solid) have small 
differences at the –40 dB level sidelobe near –90° and in the spillover lobe region 
near 75°. The far-field forced Gaussian beam feed (short dashes) produces errors in 
the sidelobes from 110° to 130°. This illustrates the importance of using the spheri­
cal wave expansion for feed patterns to accurately generate near-field patterns with 
nearby scatterers. The effects of using a far-field forced feed increases as the reflec­
tor diameter decreases.
For the 6λ diameter reflector the feed was moved relative to the feed of the 10λ 
diameter reflector to keep the coupling between the reflector currents and feed low. 
The MoM and PO/PTD analyses produce matching patterns (Figure 2.23) except 
for a few areas of difference at low pattern levels. The far-field forced feed pattern 
produces larger sidelobe differences in narrow regions than the 10λ reflector. 
The gain of the 2λ diameter reflector is not significantly higher than the feed 
horn, and a practical solution is to just use a horn instead of the reflector. The 
wide pattern of the horn adds to the reflector pattern for the 2λ diameter case 
and decreases the effective illumination loss based on the reflector projected area.

Similarly, the feed horn pattern for 3λ diameter case subtracts from the reflector 
pattern and increases illumination loss. The cross-polarization in the symmetric 
plane of these offset reflectors ranges from 14 to 17 dB.
2.7  Struts
We analyze the effects of struts either by generating a MoM model that includes 
struts or by using a separation of currents model to incrementally excite currents 
on them for direct radiation to the output fields or other objects. Figure 2.27 illus­
trates an object separation model for a single reflector feed support. These struts are 
spaced a small distance from other objects so there is no direct connection.
The following command list of operations analyzes the effects of these struts.

3.	 The output radiation is computed from the combination of feed radiation, 
current radiation of reflector surface currents, and the initial strut currents.
4.	 Because the struts block the radiation of the reflector, a new set of currents 
are excited on the struts from the approximately plane wave radiation of 
the reflector, which replaces the initial strut currents.

We may eliminate steps 6 and 7 for many reflectors where the strut radiation 
has an insignificant effect on the backlobes or the pattern behind the reflector is 
not required. 
Figure 2.28 gives the E-plane pattern response of the reflector of Figure 2.27 
using circular 0.4λ diameter struts for the 20λ diameter reflector when the struts are 
aligned with the E- and H-planes. Figure 2.29 gives the H-plane response. Having 
the struts connected to the outer rim increases the back lobe, which we can see in 
Figures 2.28 and 2.29.
We can move the circular struts inward from the rim as shown in Figure 2.30. 
Now the struts directly block the feed radiation and cause a feed shadow on the 
reflector. The analysis is the same, but the back lobes are reduced, as shown in Fig­
ures 2.31 and 2.32. Connecting the struts at 0.7 times the radius reduced the strut 
blockage loss by 0.15 dB compared to the case where they are connected at the rim. 
We could orientate the struts in the diagonal planes. By using a separate coor­
dinate system for the group of struts, we can easily rotate them to a new orienta­
tion and repeat the analysis. The steps are the same. Orientating the struts in the 
diagonal planes produces more equal E- and H-plane responses while increasing 
the sidelobes in the diagonal plane. We can compute a uv-plane (sin θ cos φ, sin 
θ sin φ)-plane (same as planar near-field measurements) contour to see the effects 
of strut orientation to determine the best sidelobe orientation for our particular 
application.
2.7.1  Polygon Struts
We may gain some advantage by using flat plates positioned so that the thin side 
blocks the plane wave radiated from the reflector. Figure 2.33 illustrates a reflector

with polygon struts. In this figure, the four struts have the same 8:1 aspect ratio and 
size. They have been orientated by using separate coordinate systems for each one 
with the z-axis along the long axis of the strut, the thin side along the x-axis, and 
the wide side along the y-axis of the rotated coordinate system. Like circular struts, 
these struts do not connect to the reflector, but have a small gap. 
While the circular struts are meshed with patches around the circle and along 
long axis, the polygon struts have mesh patches along each flat surface (four for 
the rectangular ones in Figure 2.33). The corner discontinuities cause edge dif­
fraction that we account for by using PTD equivalent edge currents. Currents are 
induced on the patches or edges if they are visible to a particular radiation source. 
The feed antenna presents little problem when determining visibility because it is 
only one source. The computational load comes from the radiation of the large

reflector with its many sources to the strut patches and edges. This computation 
load is greatly reduced if the radiation from the reflector is reduced to a plane wave 
expansion (PWE), which involves an expansion in a small number of plane waves.

The PWE excites the plate and equivalent edge currents on objects in the near-field 
of the reflector. Of course, we can also use the PWE on circular struts and dielectric 
plates of a radome.
We determine the size of a rectangular strut equivalent to a circular strut by 
considering its bending strength. Each strut is a beam whose strength is propor­
tional to its moment of inertia of its cross-section. For example, a 0.4λ diameter 
tubular strut with d/10 thick walls has an equivalent rectangular strut with an 8:1 
aspect of 1.53D width and 1.53D/8 thickness. The arrangement of quadrupod flat 
struts will have less torsional strength than the round rods but may be acceptable 
with the anticipated loads. 
Figures 2.34 and 2.35 give the E- and H-plane patterns of the 8:1 aspect ratio 
rectangular struts with equivalent beaming strength as the 0.4λ diameter for the 
20λ diameter reflector.

2.7.2  Metal Space Frame Radome
We locate ground-based reflectors inside space frame metal radomes to protect 
them from the weather (Figure 2.36) with dielectric panels connected to the metal 
frame members (Figure 2.37). GRASP can be used to analyze the effects of this large 
structure on the reflector pattern. The metal members are analyzed as struts while 
the dielectric panels of the radome are analyzed as separate structures. We analyze 
the blockage in this way because the interaction between the two structures is mini­
mal, and both produce small losses in a good design. In the following analysis of 
a small reflector 20λ in diameter using ribs 0.1λ in diameter (struts) and dielectric

(εr = 2) panels 0.05λ thick, the metal frame gave a boresight 0.56 dB blockage loss 
while the dielectric panels produced a 0.36 dB loss. Since both effects are small, 
their interaction is insignificant.
Some manufacturers of these metal space frame radomes randomize the po­
sition of the elements to minimize cross polarization and beam shifting effects. 
The metal frame shown was designed using a geodesic dome. A geodesic dome is 
designed by starting with an icosahedron containing 20 equilateral triangles. Each 
triangle is subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles. The vertex of each triangle 
is expanded to a spherical surface to form the geodesic dome. For example, a foot­
ball (soccer ball) is formed when each triangle of the icosahedron is subdivided into 
four triangles and expanded into a sphere by air pressure. The geodesic dome is 
designed by using more triangles than the football as its size increases. If we want 
to assess the tracking deviations due to small antenna motions, we use a separate 
coordinate system for the radome and rotate the radome relative to the antenna 
coordinate system between analyses instead of rotating the antenna.
Either the position of the metal frame members is supplied by the manufacturer 
or they are computed from the geodesic dome. We enter each metal member as a 
strut and each panel as a dielectric triangle. To reduce the analysis time, we include 
only a portion of the radome near the near-field plane wave beam of the antenna. 
Figure 2.37 is a reduction of the extent of the radome shown in Figure 2.36. Since 
the case shown uses 250 struts and 160 triangular panels, a program is needed to 
generate the TOR file input for GRASP. The format of the data can be observed in 
a TOR file with a few struts and generated for all 250 struts in the program. The 
triangular panels must be entered as separate elements where the electrical proper­
ties and thickness are specified in a panel object. We join the 160 triangular panels 
into a clustered scatterer so that it can be handled as a single object in the command 
list. The program should generate both the set of triangular panels and the list for 
the clustered object. If we need to rotate the radome to access tracking deviations, 
then a single coordinate system object name for the dome should be added to the 
list of struts and each triangular plate. The dome coordinate name can be added as 
a separate object when the reflector geometry is entered and before the TOR file 
is altered.

The first analysis uses a 20λ diameter reflector and a 30λ diameter dome. We 
can use similar steps as the strut analysis given earlier. The following command list 
of operations analyzes the effects of these struts:
1.	 The feed radiates and excites currents on the struts.
2.	 The combination of feed radiation and strut currents radiation excites cur­
rents on the reflector to account for the strut blockage of the feed radiation.
3.	 The output radiation is computed from the combination feed, reflector 
surface currents, and the initial strut currents.
4.	 Because the struts block the radiation of the reflector, a new set of currents 
are excited on the struts from the nearly plane radiation of the reflector, 
which replaces the initial strut currents. 
5.	 The radiation from these new strut currents is added to the existing fields 
(strut blockage).
6.	 Radiation from combination of the feed plus the currents on the reflector 
,which include the strut reradiation of the feed in the direction of the reflec­
tor, generates a set of currents on the dielectric panels. Because the panels 
are dielectric, both electric and magnetic currents are required on the pan­
els [3].
7.	 The radiation of the currents on the cluster of dielectric panels is added to 
the field. 
8.	 If we require the field behind the reflector, we use the strut currents radia­
tion to compute new currents on the reflector that block the strut radia­
tion. For small-sized radomes with many metal elements, these currents are 
required to produce correct beams in the forward hemisphere.
9.	 The new reflector currents radiate and add to the existing output fields 
and block the strut radiation in the back hemisphere, while adding to the 
sidelobes in the front hemisphere.
Figure 2.38 shows the E-plane response on the antenna when looking straight 
up through the radome when every radiation and blockage term is included for the 
20λ diameter small reflector. Figure 2.39 gives the H-plane pattern and shows that 
the radome has a greater effect in this plane. The asymmetry of the pentagon struts 
in the H-plane generates cross polarization when the antenna is pointed at zenith. 
Both planes will have significant cross polarization when pointing the reflector 
arbitrarily through the radome. 
While this example clearly shows the effects of the radome on the complete 
pattern, a more realistic use of the metal space frame radome is with an electri­
cally larger reflector. We modify the analysis for electrically large radomes by using 
a plane wave expansion PWE [4, 15] of the field radiated from the reflector to 
compute the field in the near-field on the surface of the struts and dielectric panels. 
The small 20λ diameter reflector could be solved in a reasonable run time, but for 
a 200λ reflector it was found that the run time could be reduced about 25 times 
with the use of PWE. We add it to the steps given earlier for this reflector with an 
approximate beamwidth of 0.35°.

If we require the field behind the reflector, we use the strut currents radia­
tion to compute new currents on the reflector that block the strut radia­
tion. For small-sized radomes with many metal elements, these currents 
are required to produce correct beams in the forward hemisphere. For the 
large problem, we do an initial analysis to compute the radiation pattern 
of the strut currents and find a suitable beam cone angle for a PWE of the 
strut radiation in the back direction. A suitable beam cone angle was 50° 
for this radome. Of course, in this case the blocked back radiation of the 
struts is small, but using a PWE of the strut radiation excitation of currents 
on the main reflector reduces run time significantly when there are so many 
integration patches on the main reflector and the struts.

in diameter and dielectric panels 0.05λ thick that reduce the radiation by 0.34 dB.

closely match each other except of the cross polarization generated by the pentagon 
asymmetry of the struts at the top of the geodesic dome in the H-plane.

blocks the almost plane wave (near-field) propagated from the main reflector. This

central blockage increases the inner pattern sidelobes whose angular distribution is 
determined by the blockage diameter and not the main reflector diameter. 
The following example uses a 150λ diameter main reflector with a 30λ diam­
eter subreflector. As we shrink the subreflector size, the edge diffraction radiation 
(Figure 2.43) distorts the reflected wave and limits its size in a practical design [2]. 
A PO/PTD GRASP analysis contains the following steps after using the dual reflec­
tor wizard to generate the following analysis objects.
1.	 The feed radiates and induces currents on the subreflector. Of course, if 
we include the subreflector support struts, we must induce currents on the 
struts due to the feed and include this scattering to induce additional cur­
rents on the subreflector.
2.	 Compute the radiated field of the feed and subreflector (blocked feed radi­
ation). If the struts have currents induced on them, they should be included 
since these currents will be overwritten later.
3.	 The subreflector currents radiate and induce currents on the main reflector. 
The back radiation of the feed will also induce currents on the main reflec­
tor. When we include subreflector support struts, we include the radiation 
from their currents (due to the feed radiation). An identical set of struts 
should be used to account for the strut blockage of the subreflector radia­
tion by inducing currents. These second set of strut currents radiate to the 
main reflector and also add to the far-field.

effect of the main reflector blockage on the main beam reduces as the relative size 
of the subreflector is reduced and the main reflector increases as shown in Figure 
2.46 for a 2000λ diameter main reflector with a 10:1 ratio on the subreflector di­
ameter (200λ).
A GTD analysis of the subreflector radiation alters these steps by combining 
the radiation of the feed with the reflected and diffracted radiation of the subre­
flector. This combination induces the initial set of currents on the support struts. 
Because the subreflector is fed only with the feed, it is not necessary to include ray 
output. If subreflector blockage of the main reflector is analyzed using GTD, the 
main reflector would need ray output because the rays arrive from widely differ­
ing directions. Computations using GTD analysis of the subreflector overlay those 
computed using PO/PTD for the subreflector.
Another method of analyzing a Cassegrain dual reflector is to model the subre­
flector as a hole in the main reflector, as shown in Figure 2.47. We need only include 
the first four steps given earlier for the dual reflector. Figure 2.48 compares the pat­
tern computed with and without the hole (excluding the main reflector blockage in 
addition to the main beam). The two results match for the first few sidelobes. Of 
course, the back lobe pattern includes the radiation through the center hole (Figure 
2.49). If we include the blockage of the main reflector on the subreflector radiation, 
it has little effect on the results. The pattern with a hole in the model on Figure 2.49 
has significant diffraction from the edges of the hole, which shows in the excess 
ripple over all the sidelobes. 
By using a dual offset Cassegrain reflector, we can avoid the blockage lobes. 
Figure 2.50 illustrates the geometric parameters of the dual offset reflector. When 
an antenna with a main reflector 150λ projected circular rim diameter and an

average projected elliptical rim diameter of 30λ for the subreflector was analyzed 
using PO/PTD in GRASP, not all the steps listed here were required. A comparison 
between including various blockage terms and not including them produced identi­
cal patterns near boresight and over most of the angular regions. In a small angular 
region through the plane containing the offset main reflector, small differences 65 
dB below the main beam were observed in narrow angular regions when the main 
reflector blocked radiation by the subreflector.

can be added to the analysis, and using a BOR MoM approach solves the com­
plete problem. Separate blockage terms as used in GRASP need not be separated. 
The MoM solution uses higher order basis functions on the BOR curve similar to 
the modified Legendre polynomial current expansion used on curved patches in 
GRASP. Using higher order basis functions reduces the number of elements along 
the curve and produces a more rapid matrix inversion. Of course, the application 
of the nearly orthogonal polynomials reduces the matrix condition number and 
improves the LU decomposition accuracy used over and over with each horn mode. 
Similar to GRASP, dielectric bodies can be added to the MoM portion of the model.
Figure 2.51 gives the BOR MoM solution for the 150λ diameter Cassegrain 
dual reflector example analyzed earlier. The response is very similar to the GRASP 
model. While the GRASP model used a Gaussian beam feed, CHAMP designed a 
corrugated horn with 40 corrugations 6.66λ long to produce the same beamwidth. 
The corrugated horn radiated a number of significant TE and TM azimuthal modes 
computed from modal analysis, which were solved as separate BOR MoM terms 
on the external elements and summed. 
The BOR MoM analysis may be solved on circularly symmetric items, such as 
dielectric supports and the subreflector only. The pattern output is expanded in a 
SWE to allow input to a model involving the main reflector and struts in a GRASP 
model. Of course, the blockage of the subreflector and feed must be added in the 
PO/PTD model. 
Ring Focus Dual Reflector
The single displaced axis Gregorian dual reflector uses a main reflector parabola 
with a ring focus. The design takes an ellipse and displaces it by the radius and then

tilts the ellipse and feed combination to form a point focus before revolving it to 
form the complete subreflector. The main reflector has a ring vertex (and focus) 
equal to the radius of the subreflector. This is the most common reflector of this 
type. Figure 2.52 illustrates the parameters of the design. All rays from the feed re­
flect from the subreflector so that they miss the central hole of the main reflector. It 
is similar to the dual offset reflector whereby with ray optics the subreflector does 
not block radiation from the main reflector. A study of Figure 2.52 illustrates that 
the feed rays cross after reflection so that the boresight rays of the feed reflect to the 
outer rim while illumination of the subreflector edge reflects to the reflector center. 
This caustic reflection increases aperture efficiency [2].
We analyze the reflector by performing the same steps as for the dual offset 
reflector. The extra blockage steps of the symmetrical dual reflector are not needed. 
Figure 2.53 gives the E-plane pattern of the reflector for analysis without the subre­
flector and main reflector blockage terms and with them. The two curves are nearly 
the same. Of course, the antenna radiates a beam through the hole. When we look 
more carefully at the boresight angular region, we see small differences (Figure 
2.54). A comparison between Figure 2.53 of the displaced axis reflector response 
and Figure 2.51 for the Cassegrain with the same size main reflector shows that the 
displaced axis reflector has lower sidelobes from 10° to 70°. Only the first sidelobe 
is higher in the displaced axis reflector in the comparison between Figure 2.48 
(Cassegrain) and Figure 2.54.
2.9  Dual Grid Reflector
The dual grid reflector contains two reflectors with slightly different focal lengths. 
They share approximately the same aperture where the front reflector is made from

in space (Figure 2.55). The usual application uses shaped reflectors so that the two 
reflectors have similar ground contours when mounted on a communications satel­
lite while sharing the same aperture.
We will use normal unshaped offset reflectors so we can clearly see the shifted 
beams and the extra sidelobes generated by the polarization sensitive surface. The 
two feeds have different linear polarizations so that the feed for the rear reflector 
passes through the front reflector, while the front reflector reflects the wave from 
the front feed. The polarization sensitive surface is not a perfect reflector for the 
front feed and allows some transmission to the rear reflector. Likewise, the front 
reflector reflects some of the rear feed polarization. GRASP has the semitranspar­
ent surface of spaced metal strips combined with a second electrical panel of a 
dielectric support panel. Both structures are specified for the front reflector.
We analyze both polarizations with the same steps.
1.	 The feed radiates to the front reflector and excites both electric and mag­
netic fields on the reflecting and transmitting surface. GRASP performs a 
convergence on the integral points by considering the near-field radiation 
on the rear reflector and the far-field pattern.
2.	 The currents on the front reflector radiate and excite currents on the rear 
reflector using a convergence specified on a plane wave expansion (PWE) 
of the surface current radiation plus the far-field pattern.
3.	 The radiated far-field is computed by integrating the radiation from the 
front and rear reflector currents plus the feed.
4.	 The rear reflector radiation is converted to a PWE with a beam angle equal 
to about 10 times the beamwidth of the reflector to speed the computation 
for new front reflector currents due to the closely spaced rear reflector 
radiation. 
Figure 2.55  Dual grid offset fed reflector rotated in the symmetric plane with separate feeds for 
the front and rear reflectors.

2.10  Reflector Coupling

5.	 The PWE radiates to the front reflector and replaces the currents using a 
convergence specified on the far-field.
6.	 We add the radiation of the new front reflector currents to the far-field.
We repeat the same steps for the second feed.
Figure 2.56 gives the pattern in the symmetric plane and shows the beams radi­
ated by using the two feeds. The partial transmission of the matching polarization 
by the front surface generates a second beam when it reflects from the rear reflec­
tor. Similarly, the small reflection of the rear feed polarization by the front surface 
produces a secondary beam.
A practical dual grid reflector uses dielectric spacers to support the front reflec­
tor through the rear reflector. We add them to the analysis by using a MoM analy­
sis that includes both electric and magnetic currents on the surfaces excited by the 
radiation from currents on both reflectors and the feed.
2.10  Reflector Coupling
When two or more reflector antennas are placed close together, we consider the 
coupling between two feeds of the different reflectors. We may also compute the 
feed reflection term due to the reflector radiation by using coupling. The coupling 
is determined by adding multiple terms, which can be illustrated in an example.
Consider two 100λ diameter reflectors pointed approximately in the same di­
rection where the rims are separated 5λ. In the example, the reflectors are pointed in 
Figure 2.56  100λ diameter dual grid reflector pattern in symmetric plane rear feed (thick) and front 
feed (thin) with dashed cross polarization.

different directions separated by 3°. The reflectors have approximate beamwidths 
of 0.7°. The pointing difference is about 4.3 beamwidths. We use four separate 
couplings in this example:
1.	 The feed of the “transmit” reflector couples directly to the second feed us­
ing simple path loss.
2.	 The transmit feed radiates to its reflector and induces currents that radiate 
and are received by the second feed.
3.	 The transmit feed radiates to the surface of the second reflector and excites 
currents that radiate to the receive feed.
4.	 The transmit feed induces currents on the first reflector. These currents ra­
diate and excite currents on the second reflector surface, which radiate to 
the second feed.
To produce accurate coupling calculations, it is necessary to make the conver­
gence criterion to be the radiation over a small near-field plane located at the posi­
tion of the receiving feed antenna. GRASP has a coupling add-on to compute these 
terms or more complex situations with more scattering objects. The add-on allows 
rotation and translations of the scatterers and computes the various coupling terms 
at each position to form the sum. The four terms in this example range from –94 dB 
to –112 dB depending on the orientation of the various scatterers. This small range 
of coupling terms produces a summation quite sensitive to the orientation. When 
the two reflectors are rotated inward toward each other, the coupling is –109 dB, 
while when the reflectors are rotated outward so that the two beams do not cross, 
the coupling is –99 dB. The position of the elements causes a rapid phase change in 
the various terms since they are separated by many wavelengths.
To calculate the reaction of the reflector currents on the feed, we compute cur­
rents on the main reflector using convergence over a grid on a small plane located 
at the feed. The 100λ diameter reflector with f/D = 0.5 fed with a –12 dB edge ta­
per feed produces a 33.4 dB return loss due to radiation from the reflector surface 
currents.

3.1  Introduction
The reflector antenna [1−13] has seen a wide range of applications throughout 
history since among other antenna topologies it provides the highest gain, widest 
bandwidth, and best angular resolutions at the lowest costs. The earliest account 
of the use of parabolic reflectors can be found in the ancient legend of Archimedes 
using them to focus the Sun’s heat to burn attacking Roman ships at the siege of 
Syracuse (214−212 BC) [13, 14]. In 1888, Hertz used a dipole-fed cylindrical para­
bolic antenna, along with a spark-gap generator and a similar detector, to verify the 
existence of electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell’s theory [13, 15]. How­
ever, the developments of various reflector antenna configurations did not mature 
until the mid-twentieth century when demands boomed for reflector antennas for 
use in radars, microwave communications, satellite communications and tracking, 
radio astronomy, remote sensing, and the like.
Although reflector antennas take many geometrical shapes, the most classical 
ones are parabolic reflectors due to the unique optical focusing characteristics. 
Their dual configurations with the utilization of a hyperboloid or an ellipsoid as 
the secondary reflector (subreflector) are also widely used. In this chapter they 
will be discussed in detail with an emphasis on design charts and guidelines based 
on numerous parametric studies. Other classical reflectors such as plane, corner, 
sphere, and parabolic cylinder will also be briefly discussed.
Many of the figures and text descriptions have been regenerated by the authors 
for this chapter, even though they have resemblance to those presented by Rahmat-
Samii in two handbook chapters [8, 9]. In order to enhance the discussions on clas­
sical reflector antennas, additional topics are presented here beyond [8, 9].

Classical Reflector Antennas: Design Guidelines and Performance Characteristics
3.2  General Conic-Section-Generated Reflectors
Typical classical reflectors with elliptical (circular) exit apertures, including symmet­
rical or offset parabolic, hyperboloidal, ellipsoidal, spherical, and planar reflectors, 
can be constructed in a unified fashion using the concept of general conic-section-
generated reflectors [16].
3.2.1  Conic Sections
Conic sections are basically second-degree planar curves. They can be generated in 
various ways, one of which is the intersection of a circular cone with planar sur­
faces. Figure 3.1 illustrates a family of conic sections that can be described in the 
following general form:

f, having a positive or zero value, is the focal length (distance from a focus to the 
nearest apex); 2c, having an algebraic value, is the distance between the two foci, F1

and F2. It is positive if F2 is to the right of F1 and negative otherwise. All the conic 
sections with the common focal point F1 and identical focal length f are superim­
posed for better comparison.
Eccentricity e is defined as

which is always a positive number. This parameter is a measure of the off-centered­
ness of the focal points for a given focal length. Table 3.1 outlines various conic 
sections as eccentricity e varies.
One of the common properties of the conic sections is that either the sum or 
difference of distances from any point on the curve to the focal points is constant. 
Another manifestation of this property from the geometrical optics viewpoint is 
that any ray passing through one focus and crossing the curve at a given point is 
reflected along the line connecting the crossing point to the second focus, since the 
incident and reflected rays make equal angles with respect to the normal at the 
crossing point.
3.2.2  Conic-Section-Generated Reflectors
A reflector surface is commonly generated by rotating a conic section around its 
focal axis. An offset reflector can be constructed by carving out a portion of the 
rotationally symmetric reflector surface. This is typically achieved by intersecting 
the reflector surface with a circular or elliptical cone with its tip at the focal point 
F1, the tilt angle β from the negative z axis, and a half angle α, as in Figure 3.2. The 
reflector becomes symmetric if the tilt angle β is zero.
The intersection curve is the reflector rim, which is always a planar curve in the 
x′-y′ plane perpendicular to the x-z plane. The projection of the reflector rim on the 
x-y plane is an ellipse (a circle if a = b) given by

Note that the intersection point of the cone axis and the reflector surface does 
not, in general, coincide with the intersection point of the line O’ and the reflector 
surface. In most practical cases, however, the difference between β and β′ is small 
and the change of feed direction from β to β′ has minimal effect on the antenna 
performances.
3.3  Parabolic Reflectors
Parabolic reflector antennas are still one of the most popular reflector antenna 
configurations decades after its inception. This section focuses on the radiation 
characteristics of the parabolic reflector antenna illuminated by a single feed with 
fixed phase center. Ample parametric studies will be presented. There are too 
many almost-independent parameters in any typical reflector design. To achieve a

particular design goal, they may be adjusted in a variety of ways. For instance, to 
design an offset parabolic reflector one must study the effects of such parameters as 
F/D ratios, offset angles, illumination tapers, locations and orientations of the feed, 
polarizations, and so on, on such far-field pattern characteristics as gain, efficiency, 
beamwidth, sidelobe level, cross-polarization level, scan loss, and on the like. A 
comprehensive and thorough study of all these parameters is not practical; rather, 
attempts are made to present the most important reflector characteristics based 
on a few key parameters. Some design charts and guidelines based on these results 
will be presented for initial designs, which can then be refined by using numerical 
simulations or measurements.
3.3.1  Geometrical Parameters
According to the discussions on the general conic-section-generated reflectors in the 
previous section, when a rotationally generated paraboloid (eccentricity e = 1) is 
intersected by a circular cone, a parabolic reflector is constructed. Its reflector rim 
is an ellipse (a circle for the symmetric case), while its projection on the x-y plane is 
a circle. The geometry of an offset parabolic reflector with focal length F, diameter 
D, and offset height H is shown in Figure 3.3. Note that the offset configuration 
becomes symmetric when H = -D/2.
A cone of rays emanated from the focal point O will be collimated into a par­
allel beam after being reflected by a parabolic reflector, with equal path length to 
the exit aperture plane. This unique geometrical property ensures a uniform phase 
distribution at the exit aperture, and a focused pencil-beam is thus achieved.

case). (© 2007 McGraw-Hill [9].)

Various combinations of these parameters may be given in designing offset 
parabolic reflectors, and the others may be constructed. The parameters D, F/D, 
and H/D are typically used as independent parameters. For example, Figures 3.4 
and 3.5 show plots of F/Dp, ψUC, ψCL, ψSC, and 20log(RC/RU,L,S) as functions of 
F/D for different H/D values. For symmetric reflectors, H/D = -0.5, resulting in 
F/D = F/Dp and ψUC = ψCL = ψSC. In practice, H/D varies between 0.1 ≤ H/D ≤ 
0.3 to provide clearance for the feed assemblies. These parameters play important 
roles to the extent that the far-field characteristics of reflectors are concerned. For 
instance, different path losses at the reflector tips can cause different sidelobe levels 
in the far-field pattern cuts.
3.3.2  Feed Patterns
The reflector pattern characteristics cannot be fully determined without a proper 
description of illumination from its feed. Since feed pattern characteristics are not

The shape of the pattern is controlled by qE and qH, which are determined by 
matching (3.7) to the given feed pattern. A proper superposition of the x- and y-
polarized components in (3.6) also generates a circularly polarized field, namely,

only in the main beam direction (θ = 0°). Away from this direction, it is generally

which consequently allows computation of the directivity of the reflector illumi­
nated by this feed [17]. It must be noted that the back radiation of the feed pattern 
is ignored in deriving (3.9).
3.3.3  Edge Tapers and Feed Tapers
To properly characterize the effects of the feed pattern on the reflector far-field pat­
tern, the edge taper is widely employed. In a broad sense this signifies the ratio of 
the field intensity at the reflector edge to that at its center in decibels.
Although being unambiguous for symmetric reflectors, it can become ambigu­
ous when applied to offset reflectors. Feed taper and path loss, therefore, are in­
troduced. Referring to Figure 3.3, the feed taper FTU in the upper-tip direction is 
defined as

where 0° refers to the central direction (i.e., OC in Figure 3.3) and C denotes the 
feed pattern as defined in (3.7). The edge taper ETU at the upper tip may now be 
expressed as

where RC and RU are the path lengths from the feed to the center and the upper tip 
of the reflector, respectively. The second term in (3.11) is defined as the path loss 
(see design charts in Figure 3.5). Similar definitions are readily available for the left 
and side tips. Note that ET and FT only need to be defined at one tip for symmetric 
reflectors.
For most cases of interest ETU, ETL, and ETS have nearly equal values. It has 
a more dominant effect on the far-field pattern than FT does because ET directly 
controls the reflector’s aperture amplitude taper. It is worthwhile to add that it is 
not only the taper level that controls the reflector pattern, but also the overall shape 
of the illumination distribution. In particular, the slopes of the illumination pattern

at the reflector’s edge can affect the sidelobe levels. The following results are pri­
marily based on the cosq(θ) type illumination patterns.
3.3.4  Reflector Pattern Characteristics
Reflector pattern characteristics are discussed for antenna beams generated by on-
focus feeds. Important performance parameters, such as directivity, beamwidths, 
sidelobe levels, first-null positions, cross-polarization levels, and efficiency as func­
tions of the edge taper ET (or feed taper FT) and the reflector geometries, will be 
investigated. For the sake of limited space, studies focus only on cases where the 
path losses are small (less than -0.5 dB). The edge taper ET approximately equals 
the feed taper FT and differences between the edge tapers at different reflector tips 
are negligible. Therefore, the controlling edge taper may be determined using a 
single value. Proper interpretation of the results is required when the path losses 
are substantial.
To demonstrate the aforementioned effect, Figure 3.6 displays the far-field pat­
terns for symmetric reflectors (H/D = -0.5) with an edge taper of ET = -10 dB or 
a feed taper of FT = -10 dB. Two representative cases, F/D = 0.4 and F/D = 2.0 in 
which the path losses are -2.86 dB and -0.13 dB from Figure 3.5(a), respectively, 
are chosen. The patterns in Figure 3.6(a) are very similar, which indicates that the 
edge taper ET = -10 dB is the controlling factor. Note that for these values of F/D 
the feed taper FT takes the values of -7.14 dB and -9.87 dB, respectively. In Figure 
3.6(b) where the feed taper FT is kept constant at -10 dB, however, the patterns for 
cases F/D = 0.4 and 2.0 show differences of up to 2.8 dB at the first sidelobe level, 
which is obviously a manifestation of the effects of the path loss differences. It is 
also worthwhile to note that the similarity can be observed between Figures 3.6(a) 
and 3.6(b) for the case F/D = 2.0, which indicates ET ≈ FT in this case.
For offset parabolic reflectors, the far-field patterns in different cuts are, in 
general, different even when the feed has a symmetric pattern (see Figure 3.7). The 
pattern in the plane of offset can be slightly asymmetric depending on the F/D ratio 
[18]. However, for the results shown here, F/D is large in order to reduce the path 
loss effects and asymmetry of the pattern.
Figure 3.8 shows the half-power beamwidth, first- and second-null positions, 
and first-sidelobe position as functions of the edge taper ET with cosq(θ) type il­
lumination. Note that for edge tapers beyond -20 dB, the pattern characteristics 
depend heavily on the actual feed pattern description. The sidelobe levels, spillover, 
and taper efficiencies are presented in Figure 3.9. It is important to observe that the 
overall efficiency η = ηt × ηs is maximized with a value of 81 percent for the edge 
taper of about -11 dB. Some representative far-field patterns are shown in Figure 
3.10. It is readily seen that for edge tapers around -20 dB, the first sidelobe starts 
to merge with the main beam, resulting in a widened beam. Again, for this level of 
edge taper, the exact distribution of the feed pattern can have a significant effect on 
the pattern characteristics.
Another important reflector performance parameter is the level of generated 
cross-polarized field. This topic has been addressed in [6, 19, 20] for both symmet­
ric and offset reflectors. Here, some representative cases are presented. As shown in 
Figure 3.11, for a symmetric parabolic reflector illuminated by a linearly polarized 
feed, the maximum of cross-polarized fields, which is normalized with respect to

the peak of the co-polarized field, occurs in the plane φ = 45°. As the feed becomes 
more balanced, the level of the cross-polarized field decreases substantially. It is 
worth mentioning that these results are dependent on the F/D ratio and edge taper.
In contrast to symmetric reflectors, which have very low levels of cross-po­
larized fields for balanced feeds, offset parabolic reflectors can have high levels 
of cross polarization. Even for balanced linearly polarized feeds located on focus, 
cross-polarization levels can be high, depending on the feed-axis tilt angle with 
respect to the reflector axis. For example, Figure 3.12 shows the generation of 
cross-polarized fields for various feed-axis tilt angles for a fixed offset reflector 
configuration. The feed pattern is chosen to be isotropic in order to manifest the 
generation of the cross-polarized fields. Note that for offset parabolic reflectors, 
the cross-polarized field is predominantly observed in the plane φ = 90° (normal 
to the offset plane). In practice, the feed axis is always tilted toward the center of 
the reflector in order to reduce spillover; hence a high level of cross-polarized fields 
should be expected.
A representative application of offset parabolic reflector is the NASA soil mois­
ture active/passive (SMAP) mission antenna [21], as presented in Figure 3.13. Its 
antenna subsystem consists of an offset deployable parabolic mesh reflector with 
diameter of 6m, which is shared by the onboard L-band radar and radiometer in­
struments. The offset configuration eliminates any blockages, thus providing excel­
lent radiation characteristics.

3.3.5  Off-Focus Feeds
In many applications, such as designs of multibeam or contour-beam reflectors, it 
becomes necessary to illuminate the reflector with feeds positioned away from the 
reflector focal point. This feed displacement introduces phase aberration, which 
results in pattern distortion such as gain loss and sidelobe degradations. In this sub­
section, some of the key distortion characteristics of reflector patterns are presented 
for both the symmetric and offset parabolic reflectors and for both the axial and 
lateral feed displacements.
3.3.5.1  Axial Displacements
For the symmetric reflector with axial feed defocusing (Figure 3.14), the far-field 
patterns are shown in Figure 3.15. The feed is assumed to provide an edge taper 
ET = -10 dB when it is located at focus. Results are demonstrated for feed displace­
ments toward and away from the reflector. A small asymmetry can be observed. 
These results are dependent on the edge taper as discussed in [22].
The dominant effect of the axial defocusing is the generation of the quadratic 
phase error across the reflector exit aperture. Even a small amount of axial defo­
cusing can cause substantial gain loss. For certain values of axial displacement,

the main beam widens considerably and may also be bifurcated [22]. The reader 
may have noticed a resemblance between these patterns that result from the field of 
an aperture in the Fresnel zone.
3.3.5.2  Lateral Displacements
Lateral feed displacements result in scanned beams. It is well known that parabolic 
reflectors have limited scan capability, which strongly depends on the F/D ratio for 
symmetric reflectors. An important parameter in dealing with scanned beams is the 
beam deviation factor (BDF), which is defined as

where θB and θF are the beam scan angle and feed tilt angle, respectively, as shown

BDF has a strong dependence on F/D and weakly depends on the edge taper 
and δ/F (δ is the lateral feed displacement). A good approximation for BDF is [23]

which is independent of δ/F. Figure 3.16 shows BDF as a function of F/D and for 
k = 0.36. For large feed displacements, one may have to resort to diffraction analy­
sis results in order to obtain more accurate values for BDF.
Due to the phase aberration introduced by defocused feeds, the far-field pat­
tern can be substantially degraded. As shown in Figure 3.17, the gain loss, coma 
lobe, and suppressed sidelobe of the scanned beam can be clearly observed. This

degradation depends very strongly on the F/D ratio and the scan angle in terms of 
the number of beamwidths scanned (bmws). There are some approximate formulas 
available for predicting the peak gain loss as a function of beamwidths scanned 
[24]. In many applications, however, the knowledge of peak gain loss is not suf­
ficient, and one must know the overall degradation effects on the far-field pattern. 
For this reason many selective but representative cases are given here to provide a 
clear picture of the pattern degradation.
First, an F/D = 0.4 symmetric parabolic reflector illuminated by a cosq(θ) type 
feed with ET = −10 dB is considered. Far-field patterns for different numbers of 
beamwidths scanned are shown in Figure 3.18(a). It is important to note that the 
patterns are plotted versus the universal parameter kasinθp = π(D/λ)sinθp in which 
θp is the angle measured from the axis passing through the beam that is directed in 
the θB = BDF ⋅ tan-1(δ/F) direction. The peak values of these patterns are normal­
ized with respect to the peak value of the non-scanned beam. Note that for large 
scan angles, BDF = 0.82 (for F/D = 0.4) does not accurately predict the location of 
the beam maximum. Furthermore, the feed axis is kept parallel to the reflector axis 
and is not tilted toward the reflector center. This condition is more practical when 
feeds are used in planar arrays in multibeam and contour-beam applications. For 
directive feeds with large displacements, however, it may be necessary to tilt the 
feed toward the reflector center in order to reduce the amount of spillover. In this 
case the feeds may be arrayed on a spherical surface rather than the planar surface.

Figure 3.18(a) clearly demonstrates how rapidly the reflector pattern can degrade 
for scan angles beyond two beamwidths when F/D = 0.4.
One simple way to improve this very limited scan capability is to increase the 
F/D ratio. Figure 3.18(b) shows the far-field pattern for F/D = 1.0 (ET = −10 dB, 
BDF = 0.966). Note that for this value of F/D, beams with much larger scan angles

can be generated with adequate characteristics. The prime drawbacks of employing 
large F/D values are the larger structural size and the need for more directive feeds 
to provide the required edge taper.
Finally, Figure 3.19 shows the gain loss curves for different values of F/D as a 
function of the number of beamwidths scanned. Although most of the results are 
shown for the case ET = −10 dB, similar observations can be made for other edge 
tapers. For example, Figure 3.20 shows the results of experimental data [25]. Ex­
cellent agreement has been observed as far as the effects of the feed displacements 
are concerned. There are, however, differences in the third side lobe levels due to 
the fact that the experimental feed patterns are not exactly modeled by the cosq(θ) 
type feed pattern.
The feed blockage effect is ignored in previously presented results for symmetric 
reflectors. It could become very severe if large feed arrays are used for multibeam 
and contour-beam applications. To overcome these blockage effects, the designers 
frequently employ offset reflectors that have scan characteristics as discussed here.
For offset reflectors the beam deviation factor is computed as shown in Fig­
ure 3.21. It has been shown that the F/Dp ratio characterizes the offset reflector 
patterns better than the F/D ratio. Far-field patterns as a function of the number 
of beamwidths scanned are shown in Figure 3.22(a) for the reflector F/Dp = 0.4, 
ET = −10 dB, and BDF = 0.983. For this case F/D = 0.96. Notice the similarity be­
tween these patterns and those of the symmetric reflector with F/D = 0.4 in Figure

cases in which the feed direction is kept fixed as the feed is displaced in the plane 
orthogonal to the line joining the focal point with the reflector center. For this large 
value of F/Dp, the feed is very directive in order to provide the −10 dB edge taper, 
and, therefore, for large scans the reflector would be very poorly illuminated. Re­
sults for the cases in which the displaced feed is tilted toward the reflector center 
are shown in Figure 3.23, where a remarkable improvement can be observed in 
the patterns. Finally, the peak gain losses for different values of F/Dp are plotted in 
Figure 3.24. Note that there is a considerable number of ongoing attempts to im­
prove the scan performance of single reflector antennas by employing the concept 
of conjugate matched focal-plane feed arrays. This approach may also be utilized 
to overcome the deterministic reflector surface distortions.
Figure 3.25 illustrates the L-band 2.5m offset parabolic reflector antenna for 
the NASA Aquarius mission [26]. To accommodate multiple feeds in the focal re­
gion, the three feeds are displaced from the focus to form three scanned beams in 
different directions.
3.3.6  Beam Squint
When offset parabolic reflectors are illuminated by circularly polarized feeds, the 
beam peak is shifted from the axis in the plane normal to the offset plane, which is

reflector center. F/Dp = 1.0, F/D = 2.4. (© 2007 McGraw-Hill [9].)

referred to as the beam squint [19, 27]. The amount of squint depends on the feed-
axis tilt angle and the reflector geometry. This phenomenon also exists in symmetric 
or offset parabolic reflectors with off-focus feeds as illustrated in Figure 3.26. It can 
be shown that the following expression is a good approximation [27]:

where  signs are for right- and left-handed circularly polarized beams, and θS is 
the amount of beam squint. F is the focal length of the paraboloid, and k is the free 
space wavenumber. θ0 is the feed-axis tilt angle. θB and θF are the scan angle of the 
main beam and feed tilt angle, respectively. For on-focus feeds, θF = 0 and θB = 0. 
The observer is looking in the direction of wave propagation.
As an example, Figure 3.27 shows the squinted patterns for right- and left-
handed circularly polarized feeds located at the focal point. The diffraction analysis 
agrees well with the approximate formula (3.16). Measured data [19] has also veri­
fied its correctness.
Although the amount of the beam squint angle is usually very small and ne­
glected in most applications, it does affect the beam pointing accuracy and must 
be taken into account for advanced reflector antenna designs, such as satellite

communications, deep space telemetry, and radio astronomy. A comprehensive 
study [28] shows that the beam squint can be compensated by an optimal lateral 
feed displacement, which intentionally creates an opposite linear phase variation 
to effectively eliminate the depolarization effect. A simple formula can be readily 
used to estimate it:

Formula (3.17) is applicable to various reflector configurations, and its ef­
fectiveness has been verified through numerical simulations. The same reflector 
shown in Figure 3.27 with a right-handed circularly polarized feed is employed 
as an example. The optimal feed displacement of -0.0658λ is calculated by using 
(3.17). Figure 3.28(a) shows the phase variation along the y axis in the reflector 
exit aperture plane. It is clearly observed that the linear phase variation, which 
causes the beam to squint 0.06° in the y-z plane, is significantly reduced. Figure 
3.28(b) shows that the beam squint angle is compensated and the antenna gain 
along the reflector axis is successfully restored to its maximum.
3.3.7  Symmetric Versus Offset Parabolic Configurations
Both symmetric and offset parabolic configurations are able to provide excellent op­
tical focusing performances, thus producing a high gain pencil beam. The symmetric

designs generate very low cross-polarization levels in the principal planes, and the 
few geometrical parameters make the design process relatively simple. The primary 
feed is positioned at the center of the reflector aperture. The feed blockage inher­
ently reduces the antenna gain and raises the sidelobe and cross-polarization levels, 
which may not be acceptable in certain applications. The offset geometry success­
fully overcomes the feed blockage. However, the elongated reflector rim creates a 
larger reflector, which increases the size, weight, and cost. The asymmetric geom­
etry of the reflector produces a less favorable intrinsic cross polarization discrimina­
tion and beam squint in some cases. More parameters also require more advanced 
design and analysis techniques. It is up to a designer’s choice to select the most 
suitable configuration on a case-by-case basis.
3.4  Folded-Optics Reflectors
The parabolic reflector is usually referred to as the front-fed configuration since the 
primary feed is placed at the focal point of the paraboloid. Its disadvantage is that 
a long transmission line is required to reach the feed when the transmitter/receiver

cannot be integrated with feed. In large ground station reflectors for deep space 
telemetry and radio astronomy, for example, all the bulky amplifiers and cooling 
subsystems for low-noise receivers have to be placed behind the reflector. The long 
transmission lines in front-fed reflectors would generate unacceptable noises and 
losses.
To keep the primary feed close to the paraboloid, a secondary reflector (subre­
flector) in the shape of hyperboloid or ellipsoid is utilized to fold the optics [1−10]. 
According to the discussions in Section 3.2, these reflectors are able to reflect the 
incident rays originating from one focus in a way that is as if all the reflected rays 
came from the other focus. Therefore, known as point-source to point-source re­
flectors, they effectively image a real source into a virtual source located at the 
latter place.
3.4.1  Cassegrain and Gregorian Reflectors
A popular arrangement is known as the Cassegrain reflector [29], which mimics the 
Cassegrain telescope configuration named after its inventor. Figure 3.29 portrays 
its geometry. It is observed that the incoming rays are folded back in the direction 
of the vertex of the paraboloid P by reflection from the hyperboloidal subreflector 
H. The focusing properties of the system derive from the collocation of one focus of 
the hyperboloid H with that of the paraboloid at F1. An incoming plane wave from

the direction of the paraboloid axis is reflected from the paraboloid and from the 
hyperboloid and focuses at F2, the other focus of the hyperboloid H. A feed with its 
phase center at F2 will then receive the incident energy. Note that the hyperboloid 
H degenerates into a plane when its eccentricity e is infinite.
Figure 3.30 portrays the geometry of the Gregorian reflector. Here the subre­
flector is an ellipsoid E with its near focus collocated at F1 with the focus of the 
paraboloid, the ellipsoid lying on the side away from the paraboloid vertex. The 
phase center of the feed should then lie at F2, the other focus of the ellipsoid E.

An immediate advantage of the folded-optics reflectors is that the feed system 
is now located nearer the vertex of the main reflector and, in fact, can usually be 
reached from access provisions at the vertex. More subtly, introduction of the ad­
ditional reflection at the subreflector provides an additional degree of design free­
dom. Aperture distribution can be controlled to increase efficiency and decrease 
blockage by shaping the subreflector and the main reflector.
The Cassegrain system is more compact than the Gregorian system for the 
same focal length and requires a smaller subreflector support as well. There have 
been claims that Gregorian systems provide improved wide-angle sidelobes in ap­
ertures of the order of 200 wavelengths. However, because of the blockage of the 
feed system, subreflector, and supports, the sidelobes of these antennas are not 
especially low. Therefore the Cassegrain system has gained more popularity in dual 
reflector configurations.
3.4.2  The Equivalent Paraboloid
The concept of equivalent paraboloid [29] can be employed to achieve a quick 
quantitative analysis of Cassegrain and Gregorian reflectors with acceptable ac­
curacy. As shown in Figures 3.29 and 3.30, the equivalent paraboloid is defined as 
the intersection of the cone of rays originating from the real focal point with the 
corresponding collimated rays reflected by the main paraboloid [29]. This approach 
simplifies the dual reflector system into a single reflector equivalent system, which 
consists of the same feed and the equivalent paraboloid with the same diameter D 
and an equivalent focal length Fe measured from its vertex to the real focal point.
If the focal length of the main paraboloid is F and the subreflector eccentricity 
is e, a magnification factor M is usually defined as [29, 30]:

the equivalent paraboloid is readily determined.
It is obvious that M ≥ 1 so that the equivalent paraboloid has a longer focal 
length. Therefore, the dual reflector configurations are able to achieve a large effec­
tive antenna structure, while the overall antenna dimension is kept relatively small.

3.4.3  Feed and Subreflector Blockage
To effectively illuminate the small subreflector, the primary feed is usually large 
compared to those in front-fed systems. Therefore, it cannot be simplified as a point 
source and the feed blockage, along with the subreflector blockage, must be taken 
into consideration.
One of the design principles used in minimizing subreflector and feed blockag­
es is to make them equal, as shown in Figure 3.31. The subreflector blocks incom­
ing rays, and the feed blocks rays that would hit the main reflector and be reflected 
to the subreflector. For the case shown, the shadows of the feed and subreflector 
intersect on P, the main parabolic reflector, presenting the ideal case.
In diffraction analysis, it is usually assumed that physical optics (PO) currents 
or aperture fields inside the blocked area are zero, resulting in decreased antenna 
gain and higher sidelobe levels. The blockage effect becomes more pronounced in 
reflector systems with deep edge tapers, considering that the blocked area is more 
illuminated than the edges. Figure 3.32 shows the blockage efficiency for typical 
Cassegrain reflector antennas as a function of the ratio of the subreflector and main 
reflector diameters. It has been found that by keeping the subreflector diameter 
small (DS /D ≤ 10%), the gain loss and central blockage sidelobes can be kept from 
exceeding acceptable levels. However, the best way to reduce these unwanted deg­
radations is to eliminate the blockages by the use of offset reflectors.
3.4.4  Sidelobes
Sidelobes in a folded-optics system arise from a number of sources. These include: 
(1) radiation-pattern sidelobes from the aperture illumination, (2) spillover and 
edge diffraction from the subreflector illuminated by the feed system, (3) spillover 
Figure 3.31  Feed and subreflector blockage.

3.4  Folded-Optics Reflectors

and edge diffraction from the main reflector illuminated from the subreflector, (4) 
central blockage of subreflector and feed, (5) spar (subreflector support) blockage 
and scattering, and (6) deviation of reflector surfaces from the desired contours [8, 
9].
Control of aperture illumination amplitude and phase to reduce sidelobes can 
date back to the earliest days of antenna theory and practice, and many references 
can be found in any basic antenna text. More recent techniques are discussed in 
two review articles [31, 32]. Spillover and edge-diffraction effects can be avoided 
by illumination of the subreflector with a more deeply tapered feed pattern to 
about 20 dB down at the edge. For the shaped subreflector, it is possible to obtain 
sharp illumination taper at the main-reflector edge [33].
Minimizing the central blockage and optimizing the illumination are not com­
patible, since the first requires smaller feed systems and the latter requires larger 
ones. Equalizing the subreflector and feed blockages as discussed in the preceding 
subsection is the best approach. Then if the subreflector diameter can be kept less 
than 10 percent of the main reflector diameter, shaping is possible and the block­
age sidelobes can meet the sidelobe criterion. Spar blockage and scattering [34] 
usually are not circularly symmetrical and depend upon the spar shape and system 
geometry. Spar design can minimize but not eliminate this effect. Streamlining the 
spar cross section is useful for the polarization perpendicular to the spar. Orienting 
Figure 3.32  Blockage efficiency for typical Cassegrain reflectors.

the spars in a quadruped at 45° to the horizontal is effective for Earth stations in 
keeping spar-induced sidelobes out of the region of the geostationary arc.
Figure 3.33 shows the typical effects of central blockage, spar blockage, and 
forward (subreflector) spillover on the radiation pattern of a symmetric dual re­
flector antenna. The gain loss and increased sidelobes are clearly observed, which 
could be significant for some cases. One approach that has become quite important 
is the use of offset geometry, yielding an unblocked aperture, which eliminates sid­
elobes arising from central blockage, spar blockage, and spar scattering.
Random surface deviation due to fabrication, assembly, and installation is 
inevitable. It is usually defined by a parameter, rms surface error. Consequently, 
unwanted phase errors are caused [35−40]. It has been shown that when error cor­
relation intervals are small, the results obtained by Ruze [35] for axial gain apply

where G/G0 is the normalized gain loss, and ε is the rms surface error. However, 
Bao [36] has shown that the effect of large correlation intervals is to reduce the gain 
loss and that the sidelobes are significantly lower than that predicted under Ruze’s 
assumptions regarding correlation. Recent work by Rahmat-Samii et al. [37−40] 
and a review paper by Corkish [41] on the effects of reflector surface distortions on 
sidelobe levels cover the various approaches to this subject in detail and provide a 
wealth of references.
As real-time control techniques and data processing have become more ad­
vanced in the past few decades, the possibility of correcting for distortions has

become a reality. Real-time adaptive optics for optical telescopes was demonstrat­
ed in 1989, mainly to remove distortion due to the atmosphere [42]. Adaptive 
phased-array feeds were used in a similar manner to compensate for deterioration 
of scanning [43]. Recently sub-reflectarrays were also adopted in reflector surface 
distortion compensations [44, 45]. Schell’s multiplate antenna [46], while invented 
for other purposes, embodies all the necessary characteristics for adaptive removal 
of both atmospheric and surface distortions. The advent of modern control elec­
tronics and drive mechanisms should make the multiplate antenna a candidate ap­
proach for large-aperture reflectors.
3.4.5  Efficiency Factors
Antenna efficiency is the product of a number of factors, each of which represents 
the degree with which the energy is protected against diversion from the desired 
direction or polarization by a particular mechanism. The factors include the effects 
of: (1) aperture illumination (ηi), (2) spillover around the main reflector and subre­
flector (ηs1, ηs2), (3) blockage (ηb), (4) reflector surface deviations (ηr), (5) polariza­
tion purity (ηp), and (6) losses in waveguide and feed (η0) [8, 9]. These efficiency 
factors are defined in Table 3.3.
Spillover, blockage, and surface tolerance effects have been discussed in the 
previous subsection. Improvement in efficiency and reduction of sidelobe effects 
go hand in hand for these factors. Polarization purity is controlled by feed-system 
polarization properties, by curvature of the reflector, by symmetry, by scattering 
properties of the blockage elements, and, for circular polarization, by internal re­
flections in the waveguide and feed system.
Control of aperture illumination [33, 47] is a major factor in improving ef­
ficiency. Techniques for controlling illumination can also minimize the effects of 
central blockage, as will be seen. If maximum gain is desired, the object is to shape 
the subreflector and the main reflector so that the aperture illumination is as nearly 
uniform as possible, with minimum spillover and with minimum energy blocked.
A representative example of symmetric Cassegrain reflector is shown in Figure 
3.34 [48]. Mounted on the NASA Cassini spacecraft, the 4m reflector antenna 
subsystem provides adequate gain for deep space communications during its ex­
ploration to Saturn.

3.4.6  Offset Dual-Reflector Systems
The increased interest in large, spacecraft-borne antennas and in sidelobe control 
has given rise to increased interest in and use of offset configurations, especially for 
multibeam and scanning applications [11, 49]. Figures 3.35 and 3.36 illustrate the 
geometrical configurations of typical offset Cassegrain and Gregorian reflectors. 
Ample geometrical parameters enable more flexible designs for various specific ap­
plications. The conventional pencil beam Cassegrain and Gregorian configurations 
have been studied to provide design techniques for the offset cases [30, 50−53].
To accurately assess an offset dual-reflector system, complex diffraction analy­
sis methods are usually employed. Similar to their symmetric counterparts, how­
ever, an equivalent offset paraboloid [30] can also be constructed to achieve a quick 
estimation of the antenna performances. More importantly, by carefully designing 
the offset geometry, the feed pointing direction may coincide with the equivalent 
paraboloid axis. Therefore, a symmetric equivalent paraboloid can be obtained, 
resulting in extremely low cross-polarization levels or reduced beam squint in off­
set systems with circularly polarized feeds [30, 54]. Mizugutch et al. presented a 
simple formula, which relates three geometrical parameters, to achieve such spe­
cific designs [54]:

where α is the feed tilt angle from the subreflector axis, β is the tilt angle of the 
subreflector axis from the main paraboloid axis, and e is the eccentricity of the 
subreflector. An alternative formula is given in [30]:

where θ0 is defined in Figures 3.35 and 3.36. This kind of offset dual reflectors is 
usually referred to as the Mizugutch designs.
A technique for increasing antenna efficiency by extending the subreflector in 
an offset Cassegrain antenna has been analyzed [55]. When offset Cassegrain or 
Gregorian reflector systems are used in beam-scanning or multibeam applications, 
feeds must be moved or located in the positions that provide optimal beam perfor­
mance. This turns out to be a hyperboloid for the offset Cassegrain [56, 57] and an 
ellipsoid for the offset Gregorian [58].
As a representative application, Figure 3.37 [59] shows the offset Gregorian 
reflector for the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with the world’s largest fully 
steerable reflector of 100m in diameter. It is readily seen that the offset configura­
tion successfully eliminates the blockages due to feed, subreflector, and spars.

3.4.7  Antenna Noise Temperature
The signal-to-noise ratio is one of the most important parameters for a receiving sys­
tem in wireless communications. Figure 3.38 illustrates a typical receiving antenna, 
which consists of an antenna and its receiver components. A figure of merit G/TS, 
the ratio of the antenna gain to the system noise temperature, is usually employed 
to evaluate its performance. The system noise temperature consists of two parts, 
the receiver noise temperature TR, which includes all the composite contributions 
from the receiver circuitry, and the antenna noise temperature TA, which reflects the 
noise power the receiving antenna collects from its electromagnetic environment.
In practice the receiving antenna may be directed in different pointing direc­
tions, which may not coincide with the zenith direction. However, they can be 
related by coordinate transformation using three Eulerian angles.
The noise temperature profile describes the angular dependence of noise tem­
perature, which specifies the noise level of an antenna’s surrounding environment 
at a certain frequency. Various sources, such as the sun, radio stars and galax­
ies, the oxygen and water vapor within the atmosphere, and human activities,

contribute to the noise temperature profile in a variety of ways. Figure 3.39 shows 
two representative noise temperature profiles at S and Ku bands in desert environ­
ment [60−62]. The noise temperature is in degrees Kelvin, and the elevation angle 
is measured from the zenith. It can be clearly observed that the noise temperature 
is highly angular dependent. The sky region (θ = 0°) shows a few degrees Kelvin of 
noise temperature while the ground region (θ ≥ 90°) has a noise temperature close 
to 290°K. Frequency and polarization also affect the noise temperature profile.
The determination of G/TS is usually achieved through measurement [60]. By 
measuring the increase in noise power when the antenna is pointed away from the 
cold sky to a strong known noise source, G/TS can be readily computed using the 
Y-factor [60]. Although this method is relatively easy to accomplish, it cannot aid 
in improving the antenna design for optimal signal-to-noise performance before 
fabrication.
Recently a detailed implementation of numerical evaluation of G/TS was pro­
posed in [62]. The core of the work is a computer program developed to calculate 
the antenna noise temperature TA for arbitrary pointing angle (θP, jP), which is 
defined as:

Pc(θ, j) are Px(θ, j) are the co- and cross-component power patterns of the re­
ceiving antenna, respectively. TB, c(θ, j) and TB, x(θ, j) are the corresponding noise 
temperature profile. Referring to Figure 3.38, (θ, j) are the spherical coordinates 
of (x, y, z) coordinate system whose z axis is pointed in the zenith direction. The 
antenna gain patterns, however, are usually given in a different set of (θ′, j′) coor­
dinates that is aligned in the antenna-pointing direction. In order to numerically 
evaluate the integral defined in the numerator of (3.24), the coordinate transforma­
tion is employed [63, 64] to aid its implementation.
Therefore, the antenna noise temperature is the average of the frequency-de­
pendent noise temperature profile of the antenna’s electromagnetic environment 
weighted by the antenna gain pattern. Because of the drastic change of the noise 
temperature profiles in different directions as seen in Figure 3.39, the antenna 
pointing, the locations and levels of sidelobes, and polarization have a profound 
impact on the overall antenna noise temperature. By carefully manipulating the 
antenna configuration to suppress its radiation toward those strong noise sources, 
the ground region, for instance, an optimal signal-to-noise design can be achieved.
As an example [62], Figure 3.40 shows the geometries of an offset parabolic re­
flector and an offset Gregorian reflector pointed at angle θP. The simulated antenna 
gain patterns are presented in Figure 3.41 and the corresponding antenna noise 
temperatures obtained through numerical evaluations are shown in Figure 3.42. 
Obviously the antenna configuration profoundly affects the shape and level of the 
envelope of antenna gain pattern. The strong spillover from the feed of the offset

by utilizing the Gregorian configuration. As consequences considerably different

antenna noise temperature performances are observed. At the zenith direction, the 
calculated antenna noise temperatures are 52.4°K for the offset parabolic reflector 
and 5.6°K for the offset Gregorian reflector.
3.4.8  Reflector Shaping
To control the aperture illumination and improve the antenna performances, reflec­
tors are usually slightly deviated from its geometrical shape in advanced applica­
tions. Various kinds of geometrical shaping and diffraction shaping techniques have 
been reported [47, 65−67]. And the applications have been extended to multibeam 
[67] and contour-beam antenna designs [65], reflector surface distortion compensa­
tion [66], and so on.
A more general framework of “antenna system characterization and parame­
ters optimization” was developed for reflector-shaping applications [66]. As shown 
in Figure 3.43, a set of orthogonal global expansion functions are used to effective­
ly represent reflectors with superquadratic apertures [66, 68]; the reflector surface 
expansion coefficients with other antenna parameters such as the feed locations 
and its amplitude and phase excitations are then be optimized for different design 
goals. This conceptual generalization allows designers to synthesize single- and 
dual-reflector antennas with a single feed or an array feed. The reflector aperture 
boundaries may be circular (elliptical), square (rectangular), or any intermediate 
rounded-corner shapes described by the superquadric functions. The shaped reflec­
tors are characterized by smooth surfaces, well-defined circumferences, and con­
tinuous surface derivatives. In recent work particle swarm optimization (PSO) al­
gorithm was employed as the optimizer in the diffraction synthesis procedure [67].
3.5  Other Classical Reflectors
Some classical reflectors other than those presented in previous sections have also 
been used for decades. They will be briefly introduced, and their radiation charac­
teristics will be discussed.
3.5.1  Corner Reflectors
The corner reflector antenna [69] is made up of two planar reflector panels and a 
dipole element (Figure 3.44). This type of antenna is useful in obtaining gains of the 
order of 12 dBi. Higher gains can be obtained by using large reflectors and optimal 
spacing of the dipole to the panel intersection. The gain also depends on the corner 
angle. Figure 3.45 shows the gain as a function of dipole spacing for four values of 
corner angle. Note that β = 180° refers to planar reflectors.
The size of the reflector panels must be increased as the dipole spacing is in­
creased. However, there exists a compromise between gain and antenna wind load. 
In practice the wind load can be reduced by replacing the panels by parallel rod 
reflectors. The impedance of the corner reflector depends upon the spacing and 
upon the dipole impedance.
An increase in the corner reflector gain is achieved by adding a third panel 
[70] that serves as a ground plane for a monopole feed. And an increase in its

bandwidth can be achieved with a broadband dipole feed [71]. An open-sleeve di­
pole with the center section of coaxial line in the sleeve replaced by slab line gives 
almost an octave bandwidth.

3.5.2  Spherical Reflector
As discussed in Section 3.3.5, although being a perfect focusing apparatus, a para­
bolic reflector suffers from severe limitations in large scanning applications due 
to its poor off-focus performances. By contrast, a spherical reflector is well suited 
because of its angular symmetry if the feed is moved around the sphere center, ig­
noring the edge effects.
However, the spherical reflector has the intrinsic spherical phase errors

 [72], where d is the distance from the sphere center to the 
feed and a is the distance from the centerline to the spherical surface. The sphere 
has unit radius. A practical sphere is limited in extent. If an attempt is made to scan 
it to one side, the phase errors do not remain the same but increase as the beam is 
moved off axis. That is, the value of a in the expression for phase error must in­
crease on one side and decrease on the other. Consider a plane through the sphere 
containing the axis. The phase error expression can be plotted in Figure 3.46 for a 
number of values of the feed position d. The reflector edges move across the phase-
error curves as the feed horn is moved off axis. The error decreases slightly on one 
side and increases very rapidly on the other side. A careful analysis of the error

shows that it has a strong cubic term (coma), just as the paraboloid has a strong 
cubic term. The sphere and the paraboloid have similar off-axis characteristics.
If the spherical reflector can have efficiency of the order of 10 percent, it will 
give patterns that do not change with the beam moved off axis [73]. In this in­
stance, the sphere is fed from a large feed horn that confines its radiation to a small 
portion of the surface. In effect, this solution uses a very-long-length system in 
which the paraboloid and the sphere become very much alike.
The design of the sphere is based upon the phase error formula. The error curve 
is used out to the point at which the phase error is zero. An argument can be made 
that some phase errors beyond this point can be accepted. A tapered illumination 
from the feed will minimize these errors. In practical designs, however, the phase 
error increases so fast that only a marginal improvement is achieved by considering 
the feed illumination. Some fine tuning can be done with illumination, but the basic 
design depends upon the simple use of the two points on the phase-error curves, 
namely, the maximum value and the edge (zero) value which defines the maximum 
value of the aperture radius a. A simple ratio, namely, maximum phase error di­
vided by a, is commonly used. 
To improve the focusing characteristics of a spherical reflector and to make 
it suitable for high-gain wide-angle scanners, it can be fed with a line source to 
follow the axis fields. A Gregorian corrector [74] and array feeds [75] were also

developed to compensate for the spherical phase aberration. More recently, the 
sub-reflectarray compensation technique was proposed in [76].
The 305m Arecibo Observatory antenna [77], as shown in Figure 3.47, is a 
representative application of spherical reflectors in radio astronomy. As the world’s 
largest single-dish radio telescope, it has a unique spherical geometry and the cor­
rector-feed system is suspended 137m above the reflector.
3.5.3  Reflectors with Parabolic Arc
The parabolic arc can be used as a generating curve for a number of useful reflector 
surfaces. When moved so that the focal point travels along a straight line, the curve 
generates a parabolic cylinder. With a limited motion along this line, the reflector 
for a pillbox is generated. When the focal point is moved along a circle enclosing 
the arc, an hourglass surface is generated, and for a circle that does not enclose the 
arc, a parabolic torus is generated. Table 3.4 outlines the basic parameters of these 
surfaces.
3.5.3.1  Parabolic Cylinder
The elements of a parabolic cylinder are all perpendicular to the plane of the para­
bolic arc. Because this is a singly curved surface, problems of construction and 
maintaining tolerances are somewhat easier than those encountered in the case of 
the paraboloid. A parabolic cylinder can be constructed of tubes or slats that are 
straight-line elements of the surface, or it can use identical parabolic arcs formed of 
tubes or slats positioned so that the planes of the parabolic arcs are perpendicular 
to the elements of the cylinder.

The widest use of a parabolic cylinder is with a line-source feed, which may be 
formed in a number of ways. The line-source aperture is made to coincide with the 
focal line of the cylinder (the line made by joining the focal points of all arcs). The 
aperture of the line source can contain energy in phase along the length or have 
a linear-phase variation along the length. The first produces a cylindrical wave­
front, while the linear-phase variation produces a conical wavefront. The cylindri­
cal wave is focused into a plane wave in the direction of the axis of a parabolic arc. 
The conical wavefront produces a plane wave tilted from the parabolic axis by an 
angle equal to the half angle of the cone.
The illumination problems of a line-source feed with the cylinder are related to 
those of the paraboloid. The decrease in energy in the cylindrical or conical wave 
is proportional to distance rather than to the square of the distance. The sidelobes 
present a problem in the parabolic cylinder since the relative gain between the line 
source and the final antenna system is not sufficient to suppress the sidelobes of the 
source. Care must be given to the design of the aperture of the line source, particu­
larly in control of the E-plane sidelobes.
The feed-blocking problem for a line source and parabolic cylinder is serious 
since the line source presents a large blockage. For this reason, it is usually desir­
able to use an offset reflector in which the line-source feed structure is removed 
from the path of the reflected radiation.
The parabolic cylinder can be fed by a point-source feed horn. The horn illumi­
nation function is defined by energy that falls off with the square of distance. The 
reflected wavefront will be a cylinder with elements perpendicular to the elements 
of the parabolic cylinder. In one plane the point source is focused, and in the other 
plane the cylinder reproduces the pattern of the feed horn. The result can be a nar­
row beam in azimuth and a broad-coverage beam in elevation. Since the horn and 
cylinder will give a cylindrical wave and since the parabolic cylinder focuses the 
cylindrical wave, a second reflector can be used. Use of a point-source feed and two 
parabolic cylinders gives a final wavefront identical to that of a paraboloid [78].
The parabolic cylinder can also be used as the reflector in the pillbox, or cheese 
antenna. The pillbox is formed by two parallel planes that cut through a parabolic 
cylinder perpendicular to the cylinder positioned in the center of the aperture and 
formed by the open ends of the parallel plates. When a feed is placed at the focal 
line, it blocks a significant portion of the open region. The blockage causes large 
sidelobes in the pattern of the pillbox. The feed backlobes are significant, and a 
portion of the feed’s radiation is reflected back into itself to produce a standing 
wave. An improvement in performance is obtained when a half pillbox is used in 
the same fashion as the offset parabolic cylinder.

3.5.3.2  Hourglass Reflector
The hourglass reflector [79] is generated by rotating a parabolic arc (symmetrical or 
offset) about a vertical axis that is on the convex side of the arc. The feed system for 
the hourglass reflector is a circular array. The hourglass serves to give increased gain 
in the vertical plane. The circular array has the characteristics of the Wullenweber 
system [80], which provides scanning beams, fixed beams, and beams from a hybrid 
matrix system. The sidelobes in the elevation plane are controlled by controlling the 
elevation pattern of the array elements. In the horizontal plane, the sidelobes are 
controlled by tapering the energy in the array elements.
3.5.3.3  Parabolic Torus
The parabolic torus reflector [81] is formed by rotating the parabolic arc about a 
vertical axis positioned on the concave side of the arc. It can be formed by a sym­
metrical arc or by the more widely used offset arc. This reflector is fed by multiple 
feed horns, each of which uses portions of the reflector surface used by adjacent 
horns. With multiple usage of the surface, a relatively compact structure can be 
obtained. Using this concept a spaceborne application was proposed in [82, 83].

4.1  Introduction
Based on the aperture theory, each radiating element of a conventional phased array 
antenna is spatially weighted, both amplitude- and phase-wise, to form the desired 
radiation patterns at the far-field region. The resulting patterns are shaped to aim 
the main beam at a predefined direction, place deep nulls along the interference 
sources, meet the cross polarization and sidelobe level criteria, and displace the 
phase center locations. From the aperture distribution point of view, the phased 
array antennas are the discrete version of aperture antennas such as parabolic re­
flector antennas. Inspired by the degrees of freedom offered by adaptive phased 
array antennas, reflector antennas with “adaptive apertures” are the main focus 
of this chapter to explore intriguing aspects of their potentials through the use of 
multimode primary feeds. In particular, multiphase center aperture antennas are 
of special interest. These electronically adjustable reflector antennas with adaptive 
aperture operation is greatly appreciated in advanced technologies in a variety of 
applications such as communication systems, remote sensing, satellite communica­
tions, and radars such as ground moving target indicator (GMTI) or space-based 
radars. 
First, theory and overview of generation of adaptive apertures are described. 
Following that, the performance of symmetric parabolic reflector antenna illumi­
nated by primary feeds with individual modes is presented. The modes of interest 
are the TE11, TM01, and TE21 modes of the circular waveguide feeds. It is shown 
that the reflector phase center location is coincident with its physical center when 
operating at the aforementioned individual modes. Different combinations of these 
modes, both dual- and tri-mode cases, will be considered to form adaptive aper­
tures with displaced phase center locations away from the geometrical center of 
the reflector. The dual mode cases are the fundamental TE11 mode combined with

either of the higher order TM01 or TE21 modes. Different mode content factors 
with quadrature phase differences of ±90º are studied to effectively shift the peak 
intensities of the electric field across the aperture. This will, in turn, displace the ef­
fective phase center locations of the reflector antenna. Interestingly, the secondary 
beam patterns will be at the boresight direction, while the phase center locations 
move away from the physical center of the aperture. Adaptive operation of such 
apertures can be readily controlled by signal processing algorithms to properly 
excite the amplitude and phase of these modes in either dual- or tri-mode primary 
feeds. Examples of practical dual- and tri-mode waveguide feeds will be intro­
duced. Other than waveguide feeds, other multimode feeds, such as multimode mi­
crostrip radiating elements can also be used to feed reflector antennas, and thereby 
adaptive apertures can be generated. The corresponding results will be presented 
in this chapter 
4.2  Theory and Overview
Parabolic reflector antennas can be viewed as powerful devices capable of trans­
forming a spherical wave, emanated from a point source located at their first focal 
point near the surface, into a plane wave at their second focal point at infinity. 
Interestingly, they can also be viewed as mathematical transform operators, based 
on the multiple Fourier transform and convolution operations, affecting the spatial 
distributions of their focal plane field [1], which may be carried out with signal 
processing functions. In this capacity, their focal plane fields can be effectively syn­
thesized to form virtual array antennas over a single aperture with multiple phase 
center locations and identical secondary radiation patterns [1, 2]. The importance 
of displaced phase center antennas had been well recognized in radars with mov­
ing platforms. As an example, ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars are 
extensively used to detect and track the moving targets on the ground. The main 
challenge in such radars is to sufficiently suppress the clutter from targets. The 
clutter signals come from different unwanted reflection sources such as terrain, sea, 
atmosphere, high radar cross-section objects, and most importantly moving plat­
forms [3]. One of the techniques to reduce the platform motion noise and scanning 
modulation noise is the displaced phase center antenna processing technique [4]. 
The main idea is to make the antenna appear stationary in space. Traditionally, two 
or more identical aperture antennas were exploited to provide two or more separate 
phase center locations, which were required to suppress the clutter from the signals. 
All antennas must generate the same radiation patterns at the far-zone region [3, 5]. 
As technology advances, an electronically controlled multiple phase center antenna 
within a single aperture is a smart alternative to multiaperture antennas, as it can 
save the cost and lessen the complexity and volume of the antenna system. The use 
of adaptive aperture distributions in parabolic reflector antennas opens a new win­
dow to explore the potential of such an economical solution. To adaptively change 
the aperture distribution, multimode feeds may be employed as primary feeds. This 
is because controlling their mode content factors, both amplitude and phase, as well 
as mode polarization alignments provides extra degrees of freedom to control the 
shaping of the primary feed patterns and eventually to adaptively displace the phase 
center locations of the composite reflector and the feed. 

4.2  Theory and Overview 
127
In conventional applications, reflector antennas are used to generate high gains 
with low cross polarizations and sidelobes levels. In this mode of operation, the 
reflector is illuminated by a feed normally with a symmetric radiation pattern and 
a unique phase center that coincides with the reflector focal point [6, 7]. However, 
this need not be the case. A reflector antenna can also be viewed as an aperture an­
tenna [7, 8], which reradiates the feed power incident on its surface. For a symmet­
ric reflector, the aperture is defined by its rim. However, in general by neglecting 
the diffracted rays, the reflector aperture may be defined by a surface perpendicular 
to the reflected rays and bound by their cross section, regardless of the reflector 
geometry and direction of radiation. In such a case, if the aperture field distribu­
tion is symmetric, then the reflector phase center will be at the geometric center of 
its aperture. For asymmetric aperture field distributions, the phase center will not 
be at its geometric center, but will be located near the peak field intensity. Its exact 
location will depend on the angular location and extent of the far field wave front, 
over which the phase center is to be determined [6]. Herein, the reflector phase 
center will be determined by the wave fronts over an angular region around the 
main beam.
In terms of reflector aperture distributions, a symmetric reflector antenna fed 
by a point source generates a symmetric aperture distribution in azimuth, but ta­
pered radially, in accordance with the reflector curvature. The far field is the Fou­
rier transform of the aperture field, which, due to its symmetry, results in a sym­
metric pencil beam. The main beam has an equivalent phase center at the physical 
center of the reflector aperture. A similar situation also holds for a vectorial field, 
where the aperture field maintains the focal field polarization in addition to the 
field symmetry, thus retaining the far field main beam phase center at the reflector 
aperture center. The situation is somewhat different for asymmetric field distribu­
tions, which can be represented by Fourier series of the azimuthal TE and TM 
modes in general. Thus, by adaptive selection of the mode coefficients of the focal 
region field, one can generate cophasal asymmetric reflector aperture fields. How­
ever, since the reflector transforms its cophasal aperture fields to axial far field 
beams, these asymmetric aperture fields generate axial reflector beams, with physi­
cally different equivalent phase centers on the reflector aperture. The reflector ap­
erture therefore becomes equivalent to multiple virtual planar arrays, centered in­
dividually at each equivalent phase center location. In practice, one can synthesize 
the asymmetric focal region fields using azimuthal modes, employing waveguides, 
horns, or microstrip patches. Their analog or digital combination can simulate the 
adaptive apertures as virtual array that can be used as independent beams in signal 
processing algorithms [1]. 
As already mentioned, the asymmetric aperture distribution in the focal region 
may be synthesized using multimode feeds. In general, multimode feeds contain a 
combination of two or more transverse electric or magnetic modes. The combined 
radiation patterns of these modes can be expressed by a double summation as fol­
lows [9]:

where Anm and Bnm are the complex numbers in general to represent both amplitude 
ratios and phase differences of the nmth mode. The fnm(q, f) and gnm(q, f) represent 
radiation properties of the nmth mode, and they can be functions of spherical q 
and f angles. Different radiation patterns can be obtained by controlling the exci­
tation of these modes for applications such as beam shaping, beam scanning, and 
smart antennas. The remarkable property of the round open-ended waveguide as 
well as circular microstrip patch antennas is that both fnm(θ, φ) and gnm(θ, φ) func­
tions are the multiplication of two independent functions of q and f. This allows 
one to control the pattern of each mode independently in two orthogonal angular 
spaces. As such, circular waveguide feeds with the TE11+TM01, TE11+TE21 modes, 
TE11+TM01+TE21 modes, and circular microstrip patches with TM11+TM21 modes 
are studied as primary feeds in this chapter. Their patterns are shaped to form an 
adaptive aperture distribution over a single reflector antenna, whose electric field 
intensities are spatially shifted in order to displace the phase center location of the 
reflector.  
In the following sections, the concept of multiple phase center based adap­
tive apertures antenna is first applied to a symmetric paraboloid reflector antenna, 
since its geometry is symmetric and the location of its phase center, with a sym­
metric feed, is predictable (i.e., it is on the reflector axis). Then, the feed radiation 
is made asymmetric by adding higher order modes and shown that the reflector 
phase center moves away from its geometric center, while it still generates broad­
side radiation patterns. Also, the idea is extended to offset reflector antennas due to 
their distinct advantages over symmetrical-cut parabolas. It is shown that a single 
aperture antenna illuminated by a multimode adaptive feed may provide multiple 
phase center locations over the aperture. The idea is based on shifting the effective 
aperture illumination intensities away from the physical center of the aperture ge­
ometry. To this end, the primary feed must asymmetrically illuminate the aperture, 
while its effective phase center location coincides with the focal point of the reflect­
ing surface.
4.3  Reflector Antenna Performance with Individual TE11, TM01, and 
TE21 Modes of a Circular Waveguide Feed
In this section, the performance of a symmetric reflector antenna, illuminated by a 
circular waveguide feed with individual TE11, TM01, and TE21 modes, is discussed. 
For simplicity, these modes are analytically modeled based on the discussion in 
Chapter 8 of Volume II of the handbook. Without loss of generality, symmetric 
E- and H-plane patterns are considered for both TE11 and TE21 modes. The math­
ematical expressions of the combined tri-mode model can be stated as follows:

and phase excitation of each mode. The tapering factor of the dominant TE11 mode 
is determined by n. As can be seen, the first term of (4.2) corresponds to the TE11 
mode type of a circular waveguide, and it produces a broadside pattern as expected. 
The second term of  (4.2) models the TE21 type mode, which generates a boresight 
null pattern. The TM01 mode has only Eq component, as given by the third term of 
(4.2a). It also generates a split beam with a null at the boresight direction. 
To conduct our study, a symmetrical-cut parabolic reflector is selected with 
an F/D = 0.5 and a diameter of 30l, where l is the free-space wavelength at the 
frequency of 10 GHz. If a single TE11 feed is to illuminate such geometry, the fac­
tor n in (4.2) should be equal to 2.25 to provide around -10 dB edge illumination. 
Therefore, n = 2.25 is assumed throughout our study. The corresponding primary 
patterns of each of the three modes are shown in Figure 4.1. As can be seen, the 
TE11 mode is symmetric with a main beam at the q = 0º direction. The TE21 and 
TM01 modes have split beams with a deep null at the boresight angle. They are 
symmetric as well. 
When the reflector is individually excited by these modes, it generates symmet­
ric radiation patterns at the far-field region, due to the symmetry of both the reflec­
tor geometry and the primary patterns. The corresponding secondary patterns are

plotted in Figures 4.2(a) to 4.4(a) at the frequency of 10 GHz. In order to locate 
the phase center of the reflector, the associated secondary phase patterns are also 
illustrated in the previously mentioned figures, Figures 4.2(b) to 4.4(b), when the 
reflector coordinate origin is placed at X=Y=0. As can be seen, the reflector pro­
duces symmetric patterns when excited by each of the three modes. However, the 
main beam is split with the higher order TE21 or TM01 modes. As for the phase 
patterns, they are all uniform around the main beams for all modes. This implies 
that the reflector phase center location is at its physical center on the aperture (i.e., 
X=Y=0) when individually illuminated by previous modes.   
In the following sections, the performance of the reflector antenna illuminated 
by the dual-mode and tri-mode primary feeds will be presented. For the dual-mode 
feeds, both circular waveguide and microstrip patch feeds are studied. The tri-
mode feed is the combined TE11, TM01, and TE21 modes of the circular waveguide 
feeds. Practical dual- and tri-mode waveguide feeds will also be introduced. 
4.4  Reflector Antenna Performance with Dual Mode Feed Horns
Since we have now established what to expect from the symmetric reflector antenna 
geometries, when individually excited using dominant mode TE11, and higher order 
modes TM01 and TE21 in a circular waveguide, we can now start the discussion of 
dual-mode excited reflector antenna performance and the generation of the adap­
tive apertures capable of providing multiphase center locations within a single aper­
ture antenna. Both symmetric and offset geometries of parabolic reflector antennas 
are considered. As for the primary feeds, dual-mode circular waveguide horns are 
employed to illuminate the reflecting surface. The modes of interest are the combi­
nation of the fundamental TE11 mode with the higher order of either TM01 or TE21 
modes. It is shown that the corresponding primary radiation patterns can be shaped 
such that their main beam is spatially aimed at the left or right sides of the aperture. 
This, in turn, will result in an adaptive aperture with multiphase center locations.

4.4.1  Symmetric Reflector with TE11 + TM01 Mode Feed Horn [2]
The typical geometry of a symmetric parabolic reflector antenna is shown in Figure 
4.5. The reflector diameter is 101 cm and its focal length is 38.1 cm. Its half-angle 
subtended by the rim is therefore 67º. 
For simplicity, first, the analytical TE11 and TM01 modes of the circular wave­
guides are selected, which are already available in TICRA GRASP V.7 [10]. To effi­
ciently excite these modes at the frequency of 9.75 GHz, the diameter of the circular 
waveguide feed is selected as d = 2.40 cm. The resulting feed at its dominant TE11 
mode generates a nearly symmetric radiation pattern to illuminate the selected re­
flector. By exciting the higher order TM01 mode, as a dual-mode operation, the feed 
brings extra degrees of freedom to appropriately shape the primary feed pattern 
to eventually displace the reflector phase center location. For this, three different

excitation functions are considered, and the resulting radiation patterns of these 
feed excitations are shown in Figure 4.6(a–c), respectively, as obtained from [10]:
(i)	 [TE11 (1.0/0º) + TM01 (0.0/0º)] representing the single TE11 mode as the 
reference excitation;
(ii)	 [TE11 (0.5/0º) + TM01 (0.5/+90º)] for dual-mode operation with equal 
mode amplitudes and +90º phase difference;
(iii)	 [TE11 (0.5/0º) + TM01 (0.5/-90º)] for dual-mode operation with equal 
mode amplitudes and -90º phase difference.
For the excitation (i), which is y-polarized and is due to the TE11 mode only, 
the primary radiation patterns are symmetric with a main beam along the z-axis 
in both principal planes, as shown in Figure 4.6(a). There is a slight difference be­
tween the two principal plane patterns that is the characteristic of the TE11 mode 
and in practice is corrected by adding external chokes [11]. The cross polarization 
components in the principal planes are theoretically zero and thus are not shown 
in the figure. Adding the higher order TM01 mode, to the excitation in other two 
cases of (ii) and (iii), causes the radiation pattern asymmetry as shown in Figure 
4.6(b, c). One of the co polarization patterns, the Eq-component, is scanned in the 
f = 90º plane to angles q = +24º and -24º, depending on the excitation phases of 
the two modes. However, the Ef-component, in the f = 0º plane, still stays at the 
boresight direction, indicating a symmetric illumination with respect to this plane. 
It is important to note that since the TM01 mode has only the Eq-component, which 
is symmetric about the z-axis, it contributes to the cross-polarization in the f = 0º 
plane. Its magnitude depends on the relative excitation of the two modes, and, as 
shown in Figure 4.6(b, c), it can be significant. Comparing the results of Figure 
4.6(a–c), it is clear that the dominant mode has radiation patterns symmetric about 
the principal planes. However, the combined mode patterns are symmetric only 
about one principal plane and asymmetric about the other. Thus, if the feed exci­
tations (i) to (iii) are used to illuminate a symmetric reflector, the same symmetry 
relationship will remain. That is, in the f = 90º plane, the excitations (ii) and (iii) 
will illuminate one side of the reflector aperture stronger than the other side. In the 
f = 0º plane, the reflector aperture illumination will remain symmetric. Thus, in 
accordance with the previously stated concept, with the TE11 mode excitation the 
reflector phase center will be located on the z-axis, which is the geometrical center 
of its aperture. With the other two excitations, the reflector phase center will move 
to the right or left side of the z-axis, where the aperture field has intensified. To 
confirm these results, the reflector secondary fields are computed to determine the

phase center locations. In each case, the phase center is defined by a coordinate 
origin with which the secondary phase pattern remains constant, at least over the 
main beam.

The phase patterns of the reflector far fields, corresponding to excitations (i) 
and (iii), are illustrated in Figure 4.7(a, b), respectively. For the excitation (i), the 
phase pattern is constant over the main beam. It is also constant over the sidelobes,

after a consecutive change of 180º, for each adjacent sidelobe, representing the sign 
change. This clearly indicates that the selected coordinate origin, at the geometric 
center of the reflector aperture, is the reflector phase center. Note that, since the 
reflected rays are parallel to the reflector axis, the location of the reflector aperture, 
along the z-axis, is not a critical parameter, as long as it is in the near field of the 
reflector, meaning that the reflector phase center is on its geometric axis. Figure 
4.7(b) shows the far field phase patterns corresponding to the excitation (iii). It 
is evident that the far-field phase has a nonzero slope over the main beam and 
sidelobes in the f = 90º plane. This indicates that the selected coordinate origin is 
not coincident with the reflector phase center location. However, since its aperture 
field is asymmetric about the y-axis, its phase center should also be located on the 
y-axis. Thus, a simple lateral shift of the coordinate origin along the y-axis can 
determine the new phase center location, where the far field phase pattern becomes 
uniform again. This is done in Figure 4.7(c), where the coordinate origin is moved 
laterally to the point (X = 0, Y = 13 cm). The far field phase pattern is now con­
stant over the reflector main beam, indicating that its phase center has moved to 
this point. For the excitation (ii), it can be shown similarly that the reflector phase 
center will move to the point (X = 0, Y = −13 cm). 
To develop a virtual array antenna, the secondary radiation patterns must have 
the main beam along the boresight direction, while the reflector phase center dis­
places form its physical center. To confirm this, the reflector radiation patterns with 
the feed excitations (i) and (iii) are shown in Figure 4.8(a-b), respectively, at 9.75 
GHz. The feed blockage effects are included in these computations. The secondary 
radiation patterns with the excitation (i), Figure 4.8(a), are nearly symmetric with 
zero cross-polarizations in the principal planes. The reflector gain is 38.56 dBi at 
the q=0º direction. Figure 4.8(b) shows the corresponding results for the excitation 
(iii). The peak gain is now 36.60 dBi, which drops by 1.96 dB due to the low il­
lumination on half of the reflector aperture. As expected, the cross-polarization is 
-8.44 dB in the f=0º plane, which reflects the high cross polarization of the feed 
due to the presence of the higher order TM01 mode. It should be mentioned that 
the corresponding secondary radiation patterns with the excitation (ii) are identi­
cal to the ones of case (iii) shown in Figure 4.8(b). That is, they have broadside 
patterns with a displaced phase center location in the opposite y-direction (X=0, 
Y= -13cm). This is omitted here for brevity. 
4.4.2  Offset Reflector with TE11 + TM01 Mode Feed Horn
As offset reflector antennas improve the overall performance of the antenna by 
reducing the blockage effects due to the feeds and supporting struts, it is worth­
while to extend the multiphase adaptive aperture concept to these structures [2]. 
An elliptical offset reflector aperture is selected. Keeping the previous focal length 
of 38.1 cm, a reflector height of DH = 66 cm is selected. Then, the other diameter is 
changed to form elliptical apertures with different axial ratios. A typical geometry 
of an offset reflector is shown in Figure 4.9. 
To effectively excite both the TE11 and TM01 modes and provide reasonable 
edge illuminations, the diameter of the feed is selected as d = 3.20 cm. The same ex­
citations (i) and (iii), explained in the preceding section, were again used to conduct 
the study on the offset reflector. The performance of the offset elliptical reflector

on peak gain, 3 dB beamwidth, peak sidelobes, peak cross polarization, and the 
phase center displacements is summarized in Table 4.1 for different axial ratios of 
DH/D. As axial ratio of the ellipse decreases from 1.50 to 0.50, the gain increases 
from 29.54 to 34.70 dBi, and the phase center displacement increases from 4.40 
to 14.40 cm. The peak cross polarization in the f = 0º plane is nearly constant and 
dominated by the feed cross polarization. In the f = 90º plane, it is initially around 
that of the offset reflector and deteriorates gradually. The sidelobe levels deterio­
rate in the f = 0º plane but improve in the f = 90º plane. 
The interesting cases are those with DH/D between 0.7 and 0.50, where the 
reflector beamwidths, for the selected TE11 and TM01 mode power ratio, are about 
equal. Thus, it is interesting to investigate the reflector performance for different 
mode power ratios. For further study, we select DH/D = 0.65, with width D = 101 
cm, height DH = 66 cm, and the focal length 38.10 cm. Then, with the excitation 
(iii), the mode amplitude ratio is changed and its effect on the reflector performance 
is studied. The results are shown in Figure 4.10. Figure 4.10(a) shows the effect of 
the mode amplitude ratio on the reflector gain and phase center displacement from 
the reflector aperture center. As expected, by increasing the TM01 mode relative 
amplitude, the reflector gain decreases, from 36.42 dBi, and the phase center dis­
placement increases. The effects of the mode amplitude ratio on the sidelobe and 
cross polarization levels are shown in Figure 4.10(b). In the f = 0º plane, the sid­
elobe levels remain constant, but the cross polarization increases rapidly. Thus, for 
increasing the phase center displacement, a penalty is paid in increased cross polar­
ization in the orthogonal plane. On the other hand, if the objective is to displace 
the phase center by a certain distance, then the mode amplitude ratio becomes the 
main parameter. Note also that the phase center displacement with the excitation 
(ii) is equal to that of (iii), but in the opposite direction. Thus, by maintaining the 
mode amplitudes constant and changing their relative phases, two different phase 
centers, on opposite sides of the reflector axis can be obtained.
The reflector radiation patterns for these two cases are identical, but have dif­
ferent phase patterns. Since equal mode amplitudes of excitations (ii) and (iii) can 
be implemented readily by hybrids and magic Ts, they are selected for practical ap­
plications such as in GMTI radar reflectors. The reflector parameters were similar 
to the earlier case. The radiation patterns in the principal planes, with the excita­
tion (iii) at 9.75 GHz, are shown in Figure 4.11(a). The gain is 34.10 dBi, and in 
the f = 0º and f = 90º planes the 3 dB beamwidths are 2.92º and 2.82º, the cross-
polarization levels are –9.05 and –23.74 dB, and the sidelobe levels are -19.85 and

excitations (ii) and (iii), and computed in the f = 90º plane, from their new phase 
centers at Y = ±12cm, are shown in Figure 4.11(b). Over the main beam, the phase 
distributions are uniform. 
To verify these results in practice, an offset reflector with D = 90 cm, DH =66.5 
cm, and focal length of 39.6 cm was used for measurement. The reflector and feed 
horn assembly were mounted on a slide, and placed on the far-field antenna mea­
surement tower in the compact range of the University of Manitoba. A photograph 
of the prototype antenna is shown in Figure 4.12(a). Initially, the reflector was 
illuminated with the TE11 mode alone, and the reflector phase center on its aper­
ture was determined. Then, the reflector was illuminated with the excitation (iii), 
and the reflector was moved laterally, in the f = 90º plane, until the measured far 
field phase became constant. The phase center displacement was determined by the 
amount of reflector lateral move on the slide. As already discussed, the reflector 
phase center displacements with the excitations (ii) and (iii) were found to be equal

but in the opposite directions. Therefore, the measured constant phase pattern, in 
the f = 90º plane, at 9.75 GHz and with only the excitation (iii), is presented in 
Figure 4.12(b). The constant phase distribution was achieved when the reflector 
was moved by 12 cm (i.e., Y = 12 cm), which is the phase center location of the

of D = 50λ and F/D= 0.375 at 10 GHz. It is assumed that the focal region field is 
due to the combination of the TE11 and TE21 modes of circular waveguides. The

for different mode content factors. When the excitation is due to the TE11 mode 
alone, Figure 4.13(a), the aperture field is symmetric as expected. For the combined 
dual-mode case, infinite possibilities can exist, but for simplicity, equal amplitudes 
for the modes are selected. As for their relative phase shifts, four different cases are 
considered: (1) the in-phase case of TE11 + TE21, (2) out of phase case of TE11 - 
TE21, and the two quadrature phase cases of (3) TE11 + jTE21 and (4) TE11 – jTE21 
[1]. For the first two cases, the aperture field amplitudes are symmetric, as shown 
in Figures 4.13(b). Their aperture phases are, however, asymmetric and cause main 
beam scanning at the far-field region, as depicted in Figures 4.14(a, b). The reflector 
aperture is therefore, equivalent to two coincidental array elements with equal am­
plitudes and antisymmetric phase distributions. The most interesting cases are the 
last two, with quadrature relative phases according to the cases (3) and (4). Their 
resulting aperture amplitude distributions are shown in Figures 4.13(c, d), having 
significant field values over only one half of the aperture, to the left or right. These 
distributions are similar to the TE11 mode, but shifted to the left, or right of the 
aperture center. Their far field patterns are also similar to that of the TE11 mode, as

shown in Figure 4.14(c), with slightly lower gains, due to the reduced aperture sizes. 
These two excitations are thus equivalent to a two-element array, having elements 
occupying the left- or the right-hand side of the reflector aperture. Their relative 
phase center locations are therefore shifted to the left or right, near the centers of 
their field distributions. Because they generate far field patterns, almost identical to 
the TE11 mode, but have distinctly different phase centers, they can be used together 
as elements of a virtual array. This possibility provides an opportunity for imple­
mentation of algorithmic signal processing in diverse applications, such as remote 
sensing or radar image processing. In the last two cases, the mode amplitude ratio 
influences the aperture distributions and phase center displacements. The result­
ing gains and phase center displacements are shown in Figure 4.15. With an equal 
amplitude ratio in (3), a maximum phase center displacement of 21.50 cm was 
achieved. Thus, the maximum phase center separations of the last two distributions 
(3) and (4) are equal to 43 cm, a significant distance, without causing any grating

lobe formations [1]. The results are similar to the one with the combined TE11 and 
TM01 modes explained earlier. Therefore, both TE11 + TM01 and TE11 + TE21 feed 
horns with the discussed reflector antennas lead to an antenna with displaced phase 
centers along the y-axis, or adaptive aperture antennas over the reflector apertures. 
4.4.4  Offset Reflector with TE11 + TE21 Mode Feed Horn
In this section, the idea of multiple phase center based adaptive aperture antenna 
using the combined TE11 and TE21 feed are extended to offset parabolic reflec­
tor antenna [11]. The offset reflector antenna under investigation has an elliptical 
aperture with a width of 101 cm and height of 66 cm. The focal length and offset 
clearance distance are 38.1 cm and 13 cm, respectively. The analysis frequency is 
10 GHz. 
The geometry of the dual-mode TE11 and TE21 feed horn is shown in Figure 
4.16. The aperture diameter of the feed is 4 cm. The TE21 mode is excited from the 
sides of the circular waveguide with two standard rectangular waveguides while 
the TE11 mode is excited from the end of the waveguide.
With this feed, the primary radiation pattern is scanned in the f=90º plane, 
when there is a quadrature phase difference between the TE11 and TE21 modes. 
This is illustrated in Figure 4.17 for an equal mode amplitude ratio and compared 
with the in-phase modes. 
Therefore, it is possible to move the reflector phase center location along the 
y-axis away from its physical center, when there are ±90º phase shifts between the 
TE11 and TE21 modes. This can be controlled by changing the amplitude ratios of 
the aforementioned modes similar to the previous sections. The resulting displaced 
phase center locations and gain of the offset reflector antenna are shown in Figure 
4.18 as a function of mode amplitude ratios. It is evident that the larger phase 
center separation is obtained with the stronger TE21 mode. However, the antenna 
gain drops as the phase center location moves away from the origin. Depending 
on the application, there is a compromise between the gain and phase center dis­
placements. For example, in GMTI radars the maximum phase center separation 
depends on the platform velocity and pulse repetition interval [11]. 
To show that the developed antenna is an adaptive aperture, the main beam of 
the secondary radiation patterns must remain at the boresight angle. An example

is shown in Figure 4.19 for the 0.6 TE11+0.4j TE21 feed excitation. As can be seen, 
the H-plane pattern of the reflector retains a good symmetry near the main beam 
at q = 0º.

4.5  Symmetric Reflector with a Tri-Mode Circular Waveguide Feed
So far, the idea of adaptive aperture antennas was presented by employing separate 
dual-mode primary feeds illuminating both symmetric and offset reflector anten­
nas. With the dual-mode feeds, either TE11+TM01 or TE11+TE21, the phase center 
locations of the composite reflector and the feed varied along the y-axis while the 
corresponding secondary patterns produced a broadside shape with a main beam 
at the q=0º direction. It should be noted that only quadrature phase differences 
between the either of the higher order modes and the dominant TE11 mode result 
in such adaptive apertures. 
Now, the performance of a symmetric reflector antenna performance with a 
tri-mode circular waveguide feed is presented. The modes of interest are the TE11, 
TM01, and TE21 type modes. To simplify our study, the analytical model of these 
modes is used, as expressed by (4.2) in Section 4.3 with n =2.25. The parabolic 
reflector antenna under investigation is similar to the one in Section 4.3 with an 
Figure 4.18   (a) Phase center locations, and (b) gain of the offset reflector antenna as a function of 
TE11 and TE21 mode amplitude ratios [11]. (©2004 IEE.)

F/D=0.5 and D=30l at the frequency of 10 GHz. To better understand the effect 
of the third mode on the adaptive aperture antenna, first the reflector fed by a 
dual-mode circular waveguide with the combined TE11 and TE21 modes will be 
addressed.
For the dual-mode TE11 and TE21 circular waveguide feeds, the primary radia­
tion patterns are shown in Figure 4.20(a, b), when there are ±90º phase shifts be­
tween the modes. The amplitude ratio is selected as 0.6 (i.e., |C2/C1|=0.6 and C0=0). 
It is evident that such quadrature phase shifts scan the primary main beam at the 
f=90º plane. In addition, the phase center location of the feed itself will be along 
its longitudinal axis. 
With the primary patterns shown in Figure 4.20, the reflector will be asym­
metrically illuminated accordingly. To better clarify this, the normalized amplitude 
and phase aperture distributions of the symmetric reflector are illustrated in Figure 
4.21. As can be seen, the peak intensities of the electric field shift away from the 
physical center of the aperture along the y-axis. Since the phase distributions across 
the aperture are uniform, as depicted in Figure 4.21(c, d), the phase center location 
of the reflector will therefore move along the y-axis. 
In order for the resultant antenna to be a virtual one, its secondary radiation 
patterns must have a broadside shape. This is shown in Figure 4.22 for the same 
mode amplitude ratio of 0.6 at f =10 GHz. The patterns are identical for both +90º 
and -90º phase shifts between the modes. One can well predict the phase center 
movement of the reflector from the aperture distributions in Figure 4.21. However, 
the secondary phase patterns may be used to accurately determine the phase center 
location. The amount of the coordinate origin shift, which makes the phase pat­
terns uniform around the main beam, is equal to the phase center displacement. 
This is shown in Figure 4.23 for both positive and negative phase shifts between 
the TE11 and TE21 modes. Originally, the phase patterns have nonzero slopes when 
the coordinate origin is placed at X=Y=0, as shown in Figure 4.23(a). By displacing 
the reflector coordinate origin, the secondary patterns will be uniform around the

main beam as depicted in Figure 4.23(b, c). As a result, the phase center location 
will be equal to X=0 and Y= ±10.5 cm for the C2/C1=0.6/±90º.
Now, the higher order TM01 mode with a small fraction is added to this dual-
mode case to conduct our study on the symmetric reflector with a tri-mode feed. 
The mode amplitude ratio is selected as |C2/C1|=0.6 and |C0/C1|=0.2. As for the 
phase shifts between the modes, there are four possible cases with each of the high­
er order mode having ±90º phase shifts with respect to the fundamental TE11 mode. 
For brevity, two cases with phase shifts of same polarity are reported here. Their 
associated primary patterns are shown in Figure 4.24. Now, the primary patterns 
are scanned at both diagonal and asymmetry planes of f =45º and 90º, respectively. 
The normalized amplitude aperture distributions of the symmetric reflector, 
illuminated by the primary tri-mode feed shown in Figure 4.24, are illustrated in 
Figure 4.25. As can be seen, the peak intensities of the electric field shift further 
away from the physical center of the aperture along the y-axis comparing to the 
dual-mode case shown in Figure 4.21. The phase distributions across the aperture 
are uniform as before and are not repeated here for brevity. The secondary radia­
tion patterns are shown in Figure 4.26, which is aimed at the boresight angle, as 
expected. It should be mentioned that the secondary patterns remain unchanged 
for the negative mode phase shift signs as well, which are omitted here. Therefore, 
such adaptive apertures will have multiphase center locations along the y-axis by 
controlling the mode content factors of the primary feed. Table 4.2 summarizes the 
results of the symmetric reflector performance with the dual- and tri-mode feeds 
modeled by (4.2) with n =2.25 at the frequency of 10 GHz.

beamwidth required for illumination of the reflector. The TE11 mode is the domi­
nant mode in a circular waveguide, while TM01 and TE21 mods are higher order 
modes. Three circular waveguides of selected radii: 1.34cm, 1.53cm, and 2.1cm, 
respectively, are used to support the propagation of TE11, TM01, and TE21 modes. 
For exciting the TM01 and TE21 modes, two rectangular waveguides are employed 
at the ports responsible for exciting these modes, as shown in Figure 4.27. The rect­
angular waveguides are oppositely placed in the TE21 mode rather than the TM01 
mode. Further, while the TE11 mode is horizontally polarized, the TM01 mode is 
vertically polarized. Similarly, the TE21 mode is horizontally polarized. The total

meet the bandwidth requirements for several practical radar applications. Detailed 
analysis results for this triple-feed horn are included in Volume II, Chapter 8. 
4.5.2  Symmetric Reflector Antenna Performance with the Tri-Mode Feed
A symmetric parabolic reflector antenna geometry excited using a triple-mode feed 
horn [13] (Figure 4.27) is shown in Figure 4.29. The feed reflector antenna combi­
nation is designed using the FEKO, which is a full wave analysis commercial tool 
[14]. The tool is capable of computing interactions between the feed horn and re­
flector surface, and predicts impedance matching behavior including radiation per­
formance. The reflector surface is of diameter, D = 1.2m with an F/D ratio of 0.5. 
The frequency range under consideration is from 7.47 GHz to 7.98 GHz, where 
all the three modes are impedance matched. This is shown in reflection coefficient 
magnitude plot of Figure 4.30, where the Sii characteristics of the three modes are 
shown. Please refer to Figure 4.27 where rectangular waveguide ports connected 
to the feed horn responsible for generating the three modes are shown. The S11 
corresponds to the reflection coefficient magnitude of the dominant mode, which 
is TE11, and S22 and S33 correspond to the reflection coefficient magnitude of the 
TM01 mode, and S44 and S55 correspond to the reflection coefficient magnitude of 
the TE21 mode. The dominant TE11 mode has a bandwidth of 510 MHz, the TM01 
mode has a bandwidth of 710 MHz, and the TE21 mode has a bandwidth of 890 
MHz. Thus, common matching bandwidth is 510 MHz for all the three modes. 
Also, impedance matching bandwidth is preserved for the reflector antenna similar 
to the one observed in case of the feed horn alone (Figure 4.28). 
The TE11, TM01, and TE21 mode radiation patterns of this reflector antenna 
at 7.73 GHz are shown in Figure 4.31(a–c), respectively. From Figure 4.31(a), the 
dominant mode peak copolarization gain and peak cross-polarization level can be 
observed as 34.12 dBi and −40dB, respectively. The TM01 mode radiation patterns 
shown in Figure 4.31(b) offer a peak copolarization gain and peak cross-polariza­
tion levels of 32.86 dBi and −24dB, respectively. Similarly, Figure 4.31(c) shows 
that the TE21 mode radiation patterns provide a peak copolarization gain and peak

cross-polarization level of 32.89 dBi and -37 dB, respectively. It can be observed 
that the dominant mode offers higher gain than the other two modes in case there 
are higher order modes (TM01 and TE21), as the radiated power is distributed in 
more than one lobe thus it shows reduced gain. As expected, the higher order 
modes have null in the patterns similar to the tracking mode patterns.

So far, it is shown that by altering the amplitude ratios of multimode primary feeds 
and providing quadrature phase shifts between the selected modes, the phase center 
location of the reflector can be changed while it produces identical secondary pat­
terns at the far-field region. In this section, the idea of multiple phase center based 
adaptive aperture antenna is studied when the feed is a dual-mode stacked circular 
patch operating at the combined TM11 and TM21 modes. It can be in the form of a

stacked two-layer structure with the TM11 patch on the top and the TM21 patch in 
the middle over the ground plane as the bottom layer. The substrate permittivity is 
selected as 1.15 to make the patterns nearly independent of the ground plane size 
[8]. 
Herein, the concept is further investigated to include the feed polarization in 
terms of the mode orientations of the circular microstrip patch feed to move the 
phase center location along two orthogonal directions. To this end, two cases for 
the feed are considered base on (4.1). It is assumed that both modes are polarized 
along the y-axis for the first case, whereas the second case includes a y-polarized 
TM11 mode and an x-polarized TM21 mode. The combined radiation patterns can 
be expressed as follows [9].

The offset reflector antenna under study has an aperture diameter of 20l and 
offset clearance distance of l. The parameter l is the free-space wavelength at the 
frequency of 10 GHz. The focal length to the diameter ratio, F/D, is selected as 
1.1. The corresponding half-angle subtended by the rim and offset angle are 24.20º 
and 26.80º, respectively. Now, by controlling the amplitude and phase excitation, 
and more importantly the polarization of each mode, the phase center location of 
the composite reflector and the feed can be displaced while the radiation patterns 
remain unchanged. All required simulations for the reflector antenna are carried 
out using the commercial software TICRA GRASP V.7 [10].
Similar to the previous studies, in order to develop an adaptive aperture an­
tenna, the phase center location of the composite reflector and the feed should be

displaced from the physical center of the reflector aperture with identical secondary 
radiation patterns. To this end, the primary feed should asymmetrically illuminate 
the reflector aperture with its phase center located at the focal point of the reflector. 
With a dual-mode stacked microstrip antenna, the phase shift of ±90º between the 
modes results in scanned primary main beams, in which the phase center of the feed 
itself is located at its physical center [17]. This point must be coincident with the 
reflector focal point to generate axially symmetric patterns at the far-field region. 
To conduct the study, an equal mode amplitude ratio is selected (i.e., C21/C11=1),

with quadrature ±90º phase shifts between the TM11 and TM21 modes. The result­
ing aperture distributions for cases I and II are illustrated in Figures 4.32 and 4.33, 
respectively. As can be seen, the peak intensities of the field is shifted to the up or 
down, and right or left sides of the aperture, as the polarization of the modes alter 
according to the cases I and II, respectively. It should be mentioned that the cor­
responding phase distributions are uniform across the aperture. This means that 
the phase center locations of the reflector move along both X- and Y-directions as 
the mode polarization changes while generating axially symmetric patterns at the

far field zone. The phase center motion can be readily extended to any direction by 
properly aligning the modes of the primary feed. 
To show that the developed antenna is an adaptive one, the secondary far-
field radiation patterns are plotted in Figure 4.34. As expected, the main beams 
are aimed at the q=0º direction, while the reflector phase center moves toward the 
right, left, up, or down side of the aperture. Therefore, the antenna appears to be 
four separate and identical antennas within a single hardware by controlling the 
polarization and amplitude and phase excitations of the TM11 and TM21 modes.

5.1  Introduction
The desire to shape reflector surfaces to improve antenna performance goes back 
to almost the beginning of reflector antennas. As with so much in the microwave 
world, the beginnings are traced to the World War II period where the impetus of 
war led outstanding talent to quickly develop scientific technologies into practi­
cal wartime products. These products have evolved to support the modern mili­
tary infrastructure and have had an outsized effect on more commercial ideas and 
products. As shown in Figure 5.1, shaped reflectors are seen today on millions 
of dwellings worldwide as ground units for reception of direct broadcast signals 
from satellites. Sophisticated shaped reflectors are used to increase the information 
density packed into the precious bandwidth allocated to direct broadcast satellite 
(DBS) systems, a multibillion dollar worldwide industry disseminating information, 
data, and entertainment. Shaped reflectors are used to probe the dark corners of the 
universe with high efficiency radio telescopes and are even used to create specific 
wide-angle beams for mobile applications.
However with all of these uses and decades of products and systems being 
delivered and used, the shaping of reflectors remains as much an art as a science. 
Shaped reflector design sits at the intersection of RF analysis methodologies, com­
putational capacity, optimization techniques, and material technologies. As com­
putational abilities improve, more sophisticated and accurate analysis tools are 
available for use in an optimization engine. And as better optimization techniques 
are developed, the process pushes more reliably toward the global optimum in 
more realistic time periods to either enable an optimum design or to support the 
continually decreasing design turnaround time of the commercial marketplace. 
Shaped reflector technologies also benefit from improved measurement technolo­
gies that allow more accurate measurements providing a better feedback mecha­
nism to the design phase.
The early days of shaped reflectors focused on radar improvements and aper­
ture efficiency. Airborne radar for military ground mapping required an antenna

beam with narrow beamwidth in the azimuth plane and a cosecant squared eleva­
tion pattern to receive equal power signals from the swath of ground illuminated 
by the radar [1]. Even today, this antenna pattern is used as a benchmark for shap­
ing [2]. Other developments included the method of images [3], which eventually 
led to shaped beam antennas consisting of parabolas illuminated by feed arrays. 
The other shaped reflector impetus was to improve the efficiency of pencil beam 
antennas [4]. The push for high-efficiency beams led to improvements in the geo­
metrical optics (GO) analysis techniques  (e.g., [5, 6]), where Snell’s law reflection, 
conservation of energy within a ray tube and ray path length equalization for phase 
matching, allowed derivation of reflector shaping equations. The early work fo­
cused on GO techniques to regularize the reflector aperture distribution and better 
approach aperture field uniformity that was used as a measure of aperture effi­
ciency. By the early 1980s reflector efficiency had been driven to the mid 80 percent 
level, although at a cost in sidelobe performance as would be expected [7, 8].
There is some work in shaping small reflectors to improve omnidirectional or 
other wide beam antennas [9] and the quest to improve Cassegrain spot beam re­
flector antennas for efficiency [10], sidelobe control, scanned beam aberration [11] 
and bandwidth continues. However, the largest amount of work flourishes in the 
communications spacecraft antenna arena.
5.2  Reflector Shaping Considerations
A small global industry exists to develop shaped beam antennas, tailoring the trans­
mitted and received energy to the land masses, population densities, and particu­
lar infrastructure that can be viewed from a spacecraft or an orbital location for 
geosynchronous systems. An example of a spacecraft beam generated by a shaped 
reflector is shown in Figure 5.2. Current system designs wrap the antenna beam 
shape into the system link budget where the primary requirement is availability of 
the signal at a usable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or carrier-to-interference ratio. 
This type of design accounts for rain attenuation and a statistical treatment of 
the link definition including which ground terminal types are used in particular

regions. Modulation schemes of the link determine the most efficient lay-down of 
spacecraft energy to minimize downtime of customer service to an acceptable level. 
Commercial link downtime is generally limited to a few hundredths of a percent of 
the operating time. To accomplish this, the shaped reflector focuses more energy 
to regions with higher rain attenuation to be able to punch through thunderstorms 
while reducing the amount of energy directed to drier regions to balance the energy 
distribution in the pattern. The particular pattern shown in Figure 5.3 has increased 
energy in the southeastern portion of the United States to account for the higher 
prevalence of rain and thunderstorms in that area as well as a smaller energy in­
crease up the East Coast. The dry West receives significantly less energy. The energy

is also decreased in Alaska even with the increased atmospheric loss due to the low 
look angle to the spacecraft from the ground there. The Alaska link margin is com­
pensated by increased size ground terminals in this region that ensure that the beam 
energy diverted into Alaska does not drive the design and pull too much directivity 
from the rest of the coverage.
Spacecraft also make use of the doubling of information available in any band­
width by operating two orthogonal polarizations such as horizontal and vertical 
linear polarization or right and left-handed circular polarization (CP). Use of dual 
polarization imposes strict requirements on polarization purity, with a co-pol to 
cross-pol power ratios of 30 dB or more. The first step in designing highly pure 
polarization reflector antennas is minimization of scattering from the components 
and their associated structure. Therefore, offset reflectors are ubiquitously used. 
However the decrease in reflector symmetry imposed by an offset system leads to 
an increase in the level of the cross-polarized signal. For pencil beams, the degrada­
tion is not great since the cross-pol lobes are angularly displaced from the beam 
boresight in two lobes for linear polarization systems and a ring lobe for CP. The 
CP system will also suffer from beam squint where the main beam is displaced 
slightly from the boresight in opposite directions for each of the orthogonal polar­
izations. Beam squint leads to gain loss for beams that operate on both polariza­
tions over a common coverage area. 
5.3  Reflector Shaping Techniques
When the beam is shaped, the enlarged co-polar beam coverage area now includes 
the cross-pol lobes with more interference with the desired coverage area. For pen­
cil beams, Mizuguchi [12] solved the problem by introduction of a subreflector to 
compensate for the asymmetry of the offset reflector. By arranging the subreflector 
geometry relative to the main reflector with a specific relationship between the 
subrefelctor eccentricity and the offset angle between the main boresight and the 
subreflector focal axis, the subreflector can cancel the cross-pol lobes and provide a 
blockage-free low cross-pol initial optics design. This is referred to as the Mizugu­
chi criteria. The geometric relationship is expressed by (5.1).

where α is the angle between the parabolic main reflector focal axis and the sub­
reflector focal axis, β is the angle between the subreflector focal axis and the feed 
boresight axis, and εs is the eccentricity of the conic subreflector. This equation can 
be rearranged to the simplified formula of equation 5.2 [13].

5.3  Reflector Shaping Techniques

Starting from the Mizuguchi criteria, a main reflector focal length to diameter 
ratio (f/D) and edge offset is combined with the feed coverage angle to derive a 
Mizuguchi optics system as shown in Figure 5.4 (GRASP version from TICRA). 
The solution of the optics geometry requires solving a transcendental equation that 
can be solved numerically. The Mizuguchi criteria sets the angles between the com­
ponents. The aperture size of the reflectors can then be scaled based on other cri­
teria. For example, the subreflector needs to be large enough to not be dominated 
by diffraction or too close to the reactive near field of the feed. A rule of thumb 
is a minimum subreflector size of 10 wavelengths, although 15 to 20 wavelengths 
minimum is more typical. For a pencil beam, the Mizuguchi subreflector retrieves 
the co- to cross-pol signal level from about 30 dB to near 40 dB. For a moderately 
sized shaped beam, a single offset shaped reflector is generally limited to a cross-pol 
level of 25 dB below the co-pol signal. Inclusion of the right subreflector reduces 
this level to below 30 dB.
While the Mizuguchi critereia works very well for an unshaped reflector, once 
reflector shaping is introduced, the starting assumptions are violated and the cross-
pol levels rise again. Luh [14] has expanded on Mizuguchi [12] to derive the low 
cross pol criteria for an elliptical or hyperbolic main reflector. The governing equa­
tion is given by (5.3).

where εm is the eccentricity of the main reflector. By inspection, the Luh equation re­
duces to the Mizuguchi equation for a main parabola with εm = 1. Similarly, the Luh 
optics angles can be derived from the Luh equation similar to the procedure used 
for Mizuguchi. The size of the starting broadened beam provides the additional 
parameter needed to set the main reflector eccentricity. A reflector optics having el­
lipsoids for both reflector surfaces in a Luh optics configuration is shown in Figure 
5.5. The Luh condition does lead to a better starting optics for the optimization, but

again the cross-pol degrades as the more detailed shaping progresses. Still the use of 
Luh optics as a starting point can improve the final cross-pol performance by a few 
decibels or so and sometimes more.
5.4  Frequency Re-Use
A method for reusing bandwidth in spacecraft applications is through spatial fre­
quency re-use. A particular frequency channel and polarization is reused in another 
spatial part of coverage. Although this is driven to the extreme in spot beam reuse 
using parabolic reflectors, many shaped beams also perform frequency re-use by 
intentionally creating a low sidelobe in another region of the overall coverage. For 
example, a beam covering India and the Middle East could be designed for isolation 
in Southeast Asia by maintaining the sidelobe levels to 20 dB or more below the 
edge of coverage directivity of the India beam (Figure 5.6). Another shaped reflec­
tor can then provide a beam over South East Asia with a similar isolation level over 
India. Since the reflector is finite in size, some spatial separation is required between 
the desired and isolated region. The amount of beam separation and the depth of 
the isolation determine the effect of the isolation on the performance of the beam in 
the desired coverage area. The separation region is generally made large enough to 
limit degradation to the main beam to 0.5 dB or less. Figure 5.7 shows cuts through 
the isolated portion of a spatially isolated beam with and without isolation included 
in the design. In this case, the degradation to the edge of coverage performance 
due to the decreased sidelobe level is relatively minor, although the beam broaden­
ing through the shoulder of the beam is clearly visible, which leads to some small 
amount of reduced directivity.

5.5  Reflector Shaping Using Synthesis Techniques
The synthesis problem is intertwined with analysis since an analysis methodology 
often forms the engine for the synthesis technique. From the early days of ray trac­
ing and deriving surfaces through geometrical optics, a very common analysis tech­
nique is Physical Optics (PO) [15], where the currents on a reflector surface are 
determined and then integrated to create a radiated field as in (5.4). The reflector 
currents Js include the feed amplitude taper as well as the phase information due to 
the variation in reflector distance from the feed focal point. The phase variation is 
doubled through the radius length r(q, f) to the far field pattern location.

For most spacecraft reflector synthesis problems with reflectors of tens to hun­
dreds of wavelengths in size, PO provides accurate analysis of the radiated fields 
with reasonable computational speed. This assumes that the edge taper of the inci­
dent power is reasonably low. Although optimum pencil beam efficiencies require 
a -10 to -12 dB edge taper from the feed [4], shaped reflectors are designed with 
higher edge tapers of 15 dB or more to keep more of the incident energy available 
for shaping and to minimize spillover loss. With higher edge tapers or with edge 
illumination increased by subreflector shaping, edge diffraction may be need to be 
included in the analysis, although it is usually not included in the synthesis process 
[10]. Either Geometric Theory of Diffraction (GTD) [16, 17] or Physical Theory of 
Figure 5.6  Sidelobe suppression in shaped beam.

170

Reflector Shaping
Diffraction (PTD) often supplements the analysis after synthesis to validate that the 
final performance is within the expectations.
The other key requirement for PO is very good knowledge of the source fields. 
Reflector shaping is mainly a phase synthesis method, so very accurate feed pattern 
phase is invaluable. In particular the feed phase center is a key parameter. Keeping 
the phase center stable over the frequency band is a key design parameter for wide­
band reflector feeds. Also the reflectors are often in the near field of the feed, so the 
near-field variations of the feed field must be captured. Typical feeds are aperture 
devices such as horns, so the aperture fields are carefully modeled with mode-
matching techniques and then represented as a mode series to accurately define the 
pattern. The current standard is a spherical wave expansion (SWE), where the feed 
fields are defined as a series of spherical solutions to the wave equation emanating 
from the feed’s nominal phase center [18].

Equation (5.5) describes the spherical wave expansion where r, q, and j are 
the spherical coordinates, aθ and aj are spherical coordinate unit vectors, Zn is the 
spherical Bessel function, and Pnm is the associated Legendre polynomial. Use of 
this expansion allows the fields to be accurately calculated in the near field of the 
horn, which is often required by the reflector system layout. 
Intracomponent scattering is the final item that affects analysis and synthesis. 
The optics of an offset antenna are often designed for compactness to package the 
maximum reflector aperture size within a minimal volume. This packaging con­
straint forces a trade between how tightly the components can be packed and the 
maintenance of clear fields of view for the beam. Scattering risk is exacerbated by 
the shaping process, which tends to spread the beam, thereby increasing the field 
levels at other components and potentially degrading the desired pattern. The typi­
cal process does not include scattering in the synthesis engine but checks it as a

validation after the synthesis process is complete. Figure 5.8 shows a ray trace plot 
for a shaped subreflector design. An equally spaced set of rays emanate from the 
feed phase center. The shaped subreflector spreads these rays across the optics. The 
region near the feed shows a spreading of the rays and a potential scattering issue 
requiring additional analysis.
If the reflector shaping has significantly degraded the scattering, a local region 
where the field needs to be minimized can be added to the synthesis process. By 
introducing a virtual surface in the field of view of the shaped reflector, the fields 
in the region can be monitored and minimized. For example, a plane can be placed 
in front of a shaped elliptical subreflector at the height of the feed aperture. The 
fields at this plane are included in the optimization, and the levels incident on the 
feed can be minimized to be below some acceptable level. Figure 5.9 shows a plot 
of normalized subreflector energy incident on a feed plane including the physical 
feed aperture. Note that if the optics has been designed too tightly, this minimiza­
tion of fields may have a significant effect on the resulting beam so good starting 
optics is always important.
The steps in a synthesis process include defining the reflector surface by a series 
of basis functions, evaluating the performance of the reflector surface within the 
overall antenna design against a series of goal points (typically in the far field), 
then following a synthesis algorithm to vary the coefficients of the basis functions 
to increase the directivity in the desired directions, and minimizing it in undesired 
directions and polarizations. The reflector shaping can include other reflectors such 
as a subreflector (or only a subreflector) as described later. Aspects of the feed can 
also be included in the optimization, such as location, focus, and higher order 
mode content. For example, a circularly polarized pencil beam application that is

Reflector Shaping
degraded by beam squint can use reflector shaping, feed location, and feed modes 
to improve the edge of coverage directivity by ensuring alignment of the beams. 
Another application is a hybrid antenna design with a feed array illuminating a 
shaped reflector. By spreading the beam shaping between both the array and the 
reflector, some specialized design needs can be met such as spreading the power 
among multiple feeds for very high power applications or adding some predeter­
mined reconfigurability to the beam with a smaller set of beam-forming coefficients 
and, therefore, a much smaller array to manage.
As with many optimizations, the reflector surface is defined as a series of or­
thogonal basis functions. These can be global functions or more localized functions 
similar to a finite element analysis. For many years, TICRA has used Zernike poly­
nomials, (5.6) and (5.7) as a global basis function. The Zernike polynomials have 
their roots in optics [19] and equate to the polynomials of conics at low order. In 
polar coordinates, the polynomials are given by:

The first few radial Zernike modes are shown in Figure 5.10. All Zernike poly­
nomials increase to the maximum value as the abscissa approaches the max value 
of one. To ensure that summation of modes does not increase exponentially at the 
edge of reflector, the polynomials are defined to be less than 1 at the edge of the

part. Typical values are 0.9 to 0.8. However since the Zernike polynomials are 
more volatile at the higher input values, reflectors shaped with Zernike modes tend 
to have stronger variation at the edge compared to the middle of the reflector sur­
face. In general the Zernike polynomials tend to be efficient and not require many 
modes to converge in the optimization.
Global basis functions such as the Zernikes have influence across the entire 
reflector surface. Another option is a local basis function whose influence is limited 
to only a part of surface. TICRA’s local basis function option is a bi-cubic spline 
[20, 21], which limits the basis function to a third-order polynomial with its peak 
localized to particular region of the reflector surface. The one-dimensional cubic 
spline is defined in (5.8), (5.9), and (5.10). For a two-dimensional reflector, splines 
in the X and Y dimensions are multiplied together.

The spline basis functions are nearly as efficient as the Zernikes, while having 
less tendency for high amplitude at the edges of the reflector and spreading the 
shaping more evenly across the reflector surface. Other basis functions such as

Reflector Shaping
Jacobi-Bessel functions [22] and higher-order splines continue to be explored by 
researchers with varying degrees of success. However, none of these basis func­
tions appear to offer significant advantages over the traditional Zernike and Cubic 
Spline polynomials yet.
With an appropriate analysis methodology and the reflector surface variables 
defined, an optimization loop is now wrapped around to create the synthesis pro­
cess. Typical steepest decent or min-max [23] optimization algorithms are popular 
due to their speed but can converge on local minima in the solution space so may 
miss the solution space containing a significantly better result. To combat this, 
researchers have explored genetic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization 
[24] or Invasive Weed Optimization [2]. These algorithms search the entire solution 
space so tend to find the global minimum at the expense of speed. Other optimiza­
tion techniques have also been tried such as regularizing the solution matrix and 
applying singular value decomposition to find the natural eigenvalues of the prob­
lem [25] or hybrid techniques such as differential evolution algorithm with global 
and local (DEGL) neighborhoods [26]. In addition, optimization methods have 
been tried that look at other analysis methods. Examples are use of Gaussian beam 
synthesis [27] and projection matrix method [28], which use phase-only array syn­
thesis methods applied to reflectors. A min-max optimization of PO analysis tools 
like that implemented by TICRA remains popular in general use, although other 
methods can be more efficient for specific problems.
One of the keys to a good steepest descent synthesis of a reflector system is 
reasonable starting point for the optimization. In general, shaped reflector opti­
mization problems are complex, so finding a global minimum in the optimization 
scheme can be nearly impossible if the starting point is too far away. There are 
many cases where fast optimization schemes find a local minimum, while much 
better performance can be found in a different regime of the optimization space. 
Keys for a good initial design are clean optics for the reflector layout that provide a 
reasonable balance between intercomponent scattering and excessive use of space. 
Also, highly curved reflectors tend to degrade the cross-pol performance of the 
final beam so cross-pol sensitive designs should gravitate toward longer F/D and 
lower reflector offset designs. A typical starting point is a pencil beam parabola 
that is defocused to create a wider circular or elliptical beam that is about the right 
size for the desired coverage area. This defocusing can have the virtual reflector fo­
cal point move in front of or behind the feed focal point. Moving the virtual focal 
point behind creates a flatter starting reflector, which typically improves the cross-
pol performance. However the rays from the main reflector tend to diverge, which 
can lead to interelement scattering issues. For the converse, the main reflector rays 
tend to narrow before spreading to the coverage area with another virtual focal 
region. This necking of the nearfield energy can be used to compress the packaging 
of the reflector components, but also results in a more curved reflector with the 
resultant cross-pol degradation. Balance of the two degradation factors is a key 
part of the initial design. 
The initial boresight of the reflector optics relative to the coverage region is 
another factor in shaping. The boresight is typically placed near the center of the 
coverage regions, often at a predetermined, relatively coarse setting that enables 
standard hardware to connect the reflector components to the rest of the structure. 
However, the boresight direction can make discernible differences in performance, 

5.5  Reflector Shaping Using Synthesis Techniques

particularly in the cross-pol performance. Moving the boresight can effect where 
the cross-pol lobes start so a judicious choice of pointing can sometimes improve 
the overall performance. However, if the co-pol performance of the shaped beam 
is the only driver for the optimization, then the boresight typically does not affect 
the final result.
Another issue in reflector synthesis is how much shaping is too much. In gen­
eral, adding higher-order basis functions to the synthesis makes some improvement 
in the beam performance, although with diminishing impact (e.g., [29]). However, 
the improvement does not go to zero. For example, compared to an infinite aper­
ture (a beam shaped perfectly to the required coverage area), a good design often 
has an efficiency of 50 to 60 percent. This number can change significantly with the 
operating bandwidth and cross-pol or sidelobe suppression. Adding more modes 
can add a few tenths of a decibel and gain a few more percent in efficiency. How­
ever as more modes are added, design sensitivities are increased so that the design 
quickly moves into a region where the manufacturing tolerances and environmen­
tal distortions will degrade and surpass any small performance gains. This can be 
particularly acute when sidelobe suppression is a significant portion of the design. 
To combat this effect, manufacturing tolerance analysis is included as a validation 
step in the design. The rules of thumb for number of modes need to be balanced 
against the actual gains and sensitivities of the design, which are a function of the 
realities of the manufacturability of the deflector and the final shape.
The art of reflector shaping must also address how to include sidelobe and 
cross-pol suppression in those designs that require it. Including suppression in the 
goal function from the start of the optimization process typically leads to a subop­
timized solution since too much weight is put on the isolation performance. Simi­
larly doing a complete co-pol optimization prior to including any suppression also 
usually leads to a local minimum. Therefore suppression needs to be added after 
the co-pol performance has started to converge, but not before it is polished up to 
the final design. Unfortunately, there are no hard rules for exactly where to include 
the isolation. Different designers have different strategies that are gained from 
Figure 5.11  Radiation pattern from subreflector only shaping at L-band.

experience and even then may not be the best strategy for any particular design. 
Often a couple of strategies must be tried before the optimum design is achieved.
While shaping of main reflectors often has the most effect on the beam, subre­
flector shaping is being used to augment the shaping of a main reflector or as the 
primary beam shaping device in cases where the main reflector is not amenable to 
shaping. For example, in the case of an L- or S-Band (1 to 2 GHz) design for a geo­
synchronous spacecraft, the need for a moderate beam size (say, the size of North 
America) may require a main reflector of 5m to 15m in size to reach the required 
50 wavelengths or more in reflector size. This size of reflector can be achieved 
with an unfurlable reflector, but unfurlable reflectors generally have a very limited 
ability for shaping and are usually built as paraboloids. However, when combined 
with a solid shaped subreflector of only 15 wavelengths or so, a reasonable amount 
of beam shaping can be achieved, as shown in Figure 5.9. The beam will not be 
shaped as well as the case of full main beam shaping, but the combination does 
provide for effective beam tailoring in the case of a required parabolic main. When 
shaped subreflectors are used in conjunction with shaped mains, the effect of the 
shaped subreflector is much less dramatic. Since main reflector shaping is primarily 
a phase optimization of the near-field, subreflector shaping adds some ability to 
add amplitude optimization to the process. However, due to the trade-offs of spill 
over and general beam efficiency, the addition of amplitude shaping is less effec­
tive. Typically subreflector shaping will improve the co-pol performance by a few 
tenths of a decibel; however, that improvement may be warranted in many design 
applications.
5.6  Shaping Limitations and Manufacturing Aspects
In the early days of reflector shaping, designs were limited to a single band so that 
requirements were limited to less than 10 percent bandwidth. Currently reflectors 
are shaped to at least octave bandwidths for contoured beams and multiple octaves 
for optimized pencil beams. Although the feed is a major challenge for wideband 
designs, the reflector shaping itself is also challenging, including the trades between 
the better shaping authority at the higher end of the band and the balance of re­
quirements at the lower end. A rule of thumb is that adding a second band to a 
shaped design degrades the performance by about 0.25 dB compared to a design 
shaped to a single band. This change can be much more and sometimes less depend­
ing on the details of the optimization and the separation of the bands.
One of the key limitations to reflector shaping is manufacturing tolerances 
of the reflector shape. For reflectors that must work in a harsh environment, sur­
face tolerances due to environmental conditions such as high winds or extreme 
temperatures pose an additional challenge. There are a variety of manufacturing 
methodologies used to build tightly toleranced reflector surfaces. These are traded 
against the costs and volume of units produced. For mass-produced ground sta­
tion reflectors, injection molded plastic coated with metallic paint is a common 
manufacturing solution. Typical tolerances are about 1 mm (.05 in) of rms surface 
accuracy, which result in degradation of only a decibel or less in directivity for a 
pencil beam application at 12 GHz. For large ground stations, curved aluminum 
plates are fastened to a metallic backing structure. The plates are shimmed to create 

5.6  Shaping Limitations and Manufacturing Aspects 
177
a surface accuracy of typically about 0.5 mm (0.02 in). For very high frequency 
surfaces (50 GHz and higher) the material is built thicker than the expected final 
product and the surface is machined after initial fabrication to achieve tolerance of 
0.05 mm (0.002 in) or less. 
For spacecraft applications, the reflectors are usually built from graphite com­
posite materials as pictured in Figure 5.12. Graphite composites allow the coef­
ficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to be balanced between the graphite fibers, 
which have a slightly negative CTE, and the encasing plastic, which is positive. 
Proper volumetric balancing results in a near zero CTE for the composite material. 
The fabrication techniques are also designed for precision. The reflectors are built 
on tooling molds that are designed to have very low distortion during the manufac­
turing environments. For example, the plastics are often cured at a high tempera­
ture, so the molds are built from low CTE materials such as composite graphite 
or INVAR, a metal alloy that is designed for low CTE. With these manufacturing 
techniques, reflector surfaces are built with surface accuracies of 0.05 mm (0.002 
in) or so and thermal distortion profiles of a similar value. For highly optimized 
shaped beam designs, these distortion levels translate into performance degrada­
tions of about 0.25 dB in the primary coverage area and a few dB in the sidelobes. 
It is now common practice to review the designs against some typical manufactur­
ing or other distortions that are representative of the manufacturing technology of 
the reflector. Some designs can be susceptible to distortion degradation, particu­
larly if the design has been pushed to a high number of surface modes or contains 
challenging design goals such as low sidelobes or cross-pol or contains multiple 
coverage areas with disparate gain level requirements (graded or tapered gain cov­
erage requirements). For some manufacturing technology, the as-built distortion or 
the thermal distortion does have a common characteristic. The nonrandom distor­
tions can be included in the shaping design so that the reflector is predistorted to 
Figure 5.12  Spacecraft graphite 2.4m shaped reflector.

compensate for the expected distortion. This technique can be challenged by the 
details of the distortion, which may mask or swamp the common distortion. 
Another potential distortion is degradation to the wave polarization by the 
reflecting surface. For composite structure, the details of composite lay-up and the 
varying fiber directions can lead to depolarization of the wave. This is typically not 
a problem for operation at less than 10 GHz, but can increase dramatically above 
20 GHz. Ka-band systems often require a particular design of composite reflec­
tors that can preclude some features that allow the reflectors to be built in a more 
lightweight manner. For example, some composite structures use a fabric woven 
to incorporate holes in the surface. The holes enable a lighter design and collect 
less wind load. However, the details of the holes can lead to a depolarization of 
the reflected signals, making the material unsuitable for systems requiring a high 
degree of polarization isolation. Another practicality of reflector fabrication and 
analysis is limitations on the foldedness or radius of curvature of the reflector sur­
face. A small radius of curvature can be difficult to fabricate accurately with some 
fabrication technologies such as the use of honeycomb core as a structural element. 
Also the design and analysis tools typically assume no interaction between cur­
rents on the reflector surface. As the curvature increases, the currents can radiate 
to other parts of the reflector as well as the far field. Therefore, radius of curvature 
is usually at least monitored during reflector surface optimization and sometimes 
controlled as a limitation in the optimization procedure.
In the satellite manufacturing world, the shaped reflector design has been 
honed to a fine craft. However, there are still significant improvements that will 
be achieved in the future. As computing capacity continues its inexorable climb, 
more and more details of the reflector design can be included in the optimization. 
Factors that are currently analyzed after the optimization will be included in the 
design phase, including edge treatments, surface irregularities such as hold-down 
holes [30], and scattering from the other structures used to support the reflector 
or other near-by structures. More precise analysis methodologies such as method 
of moments will be folded in replacing more approximate methods and leading to 
increased accuracies, particularly in cross-pol and sidelobe pattern synthesis [31]. 
Also, we can anticipate improvements in the optimization methodologies. Current 
techniques still depend on an optimization starting point that is reasonably close 
to final optimized solution. Improvements will allow a more global optimization 
that moves well beyond the local minima and finds the global minima including the 
constraint list. The optimizations will also find minima that have minimal sensitiv­
ity to certain error parameters such as surface manufacturing accuracy. Yet even 
as the science improves, some aspects of art and creativity are expected to play a 
significant role in a process as complicated as shaping reflectors.

6.1  Introduction
Antennas that are required to scan only over relatively small angles are called lim­
ited scan antennas. Such antennas are required in some radar systems that must 
acquire and track a number of targets within a limited angular range. Further ap­
plications involve satellite communications systems in which highly directional an­
tennas are used to cover a limited angular range.
For a given aperture antenna, a reflector antenna is much less expensive than 
a phased array. However, unless the reflector antenna is mechanically rotatable, its 
performance is limited to a very small angular range. Conversely, a phased array 
of the same aperture has very wide angular coverage but is expensive and difficult 
to build. 
Classic reflector geometry is relatively limited with respect to the number of 
beamwidths of scan off boresight. This is because the secondary pattern of a re­
flector antenna deteriorates significantly when the pencil beam is scanned beyond 
a few beamwidths. Since many applications require large numbers of beamwidth 
scans, this subject has been investigated intensely. Several methods have been used 
to enhance the scan capability of reflector antennas. One method has involved 
shaping the reflector surfaces from the classical paraboloid and hyperboloid shapes 
to reflector shapes that specifically enhance the beam scanning capability. Gener­
ally, this approach has required two reflector surfaces to obtain the degrees of 
freedom required in the design synthesis. This chapter deals with dual-reflector

antennas, which use the concepts of bifocal and bicollimated reflector antennas to 
increase scan capability.
6.2  Bifocal Dual Reflector Antennas
As the name indicates, the structure of a bifocal dual reflector antenna contains two 
reflectors, a subreflector and a main reflector; the reflectors are shaped to have two 
focal points. The structure can be either a circularly symmetric structure or an offset 
structure. In addition, the configuration could be a Cassegrain or a Gregorian type. 
In this section, we will discuss all these variations.
6.2.1  Cassegrain Configuration
In the Cassegrain configuration, the subreflector is convex shaped toward the main 
reflector.
6.2.1.1  Circularly Symmetric Structure
It is well known that a bifocal dielectric lens [1, 2] has a wider angle scan capability 
than a dielectric lens with a single focus. Similarly, a bifocal dual reflector antenna 
has a better scan capability than a classical Cassegrain reflector [3–5].
The bifocal dual reflector is obtained by first designing a bifocal cylindrical re­
flector using geometrical optics and then revolving the cross-section curve around 
the axis of symmetry to form a surface of revolution. Figure 6.1 shows a cross sec­
tion of a cylindrical bifocal dual reflector antenna configuration. The focal points 
A and B are displaced from the reflector axis of symmetry by an amount d, and the 
subreflector intersects the x-axis at x = P. The cross-section curve of the reflector 
surfaces is designed so that a feed placed at A produces a beam emerging at a scan 
angle α, and a feed placed at B produces a beam emerging at a scan angle of -α. 
In other words, when plane waves impinge on the reflector system at an angle α or 
-α, they are focused onto the focal points A and B, respectively. The cross-section 
curves are assumed to be symmetrical with regard to the x-axis and are then deter­
mined by a ray tracing technique.
Ray tracing design procedure gives a series of discrete points on both the sub­
reflector and the main reflector. These series of points on the reflector surfaces are 
then approximated by best-fit (in the least squares sense) polynomials. These poly­
nomial representations for the reflector surfaces are then used to find the radiation 
patterns for several scan angles using numerical methods. The computed radiation 
patterns are then compared with those of classical Cassegrain reflector antennas. 
The results confirm that the bifocal reflector has a better scan capability.
Design Procedure
Referring to Figure 6.1, one first determines (see Appendix A) the displacement d of 
the focal points A and B, the center apex (P, 0) of the subreflector, the design scan 
angle α, and the path length L from each focus to its respective phase front. Then, 
using the ray tracing technique [1], the main reflector point (x1′, y1′) and the slope 

6.2  Bifocal Dual Reflector Antennas

at that point are determined. Next, from this known point (x1′, y1′) and the slope, a 
point (x2, y2) and the corresponding slope on the subreflector can be determined. By 
continuing this same process, a series of points and slopes on the reflector surfaces 
are found in succession. The pertinent results are given by two sets of formulas. The 
first set gives a point (xk′, yk′) and the slope at that point on the main reflector when 
a point (xk, yk) and the corresponding slope on the subreflector are known. These 
relations (obtained by tracing the rays emanating from focus A) are as follows. For 
detailed derivation, readers are referred to [4].

Starting with the initial point (x1, y1) and the angles θ1, γ1 and making use of 
the first and then the second set of formulas and continuing the process, a series of 
points and slopes on each reflector surface is found in succession.
Polynomial Approximation
The design procedure discussed in the previous section gives a finite number of 
points and an equal number of slopes on the reflector surfaces. In order to define 
the reflector surfaces completely, it is necessary to use an approximation. It is con­
venient to approximate the reflector surfaces by best-fit (in the least squares sense) 
polynomials. Since the reflectors are symmetrical, only even powers are required. 
The reflector surfaces are represented by the polynomials

where xs and ys are the subreflector coordinates, and xM and yM are the main reflec­
tor coordinates.
The degree of the polynomial used to fit the data points depends on the accu­
racy requirements. In the following example, a fourth-degree polynomial was suf­
ficient. If the number of data points available limits the degree of the polynomial, 
the known slopes on the reflector curves can be used to improve the accuracy.
Equivalent Cassegrain Reflector
To compare the radiation characteristics of a bifocal reflector with that of a Casseg­
rain reflector, it is necessary to choose equivalent reflectors. In this chapter, equiva­
lence is established by making the main reflector diameter of each system and the 
spacing between the two reflectors (measured along the reflector axis) equal. The 
focal point for an on-axis beam is the origin of the coordinate system. When specific 
examples are considered, the main reflector in the bifocal antenna very closely ap­
proximates a paraboloid. This means the higher order coefficients (fourth-degree 
and above) in (6.16) are very small, and the equivalent paraboloid can be defined 
by the first two terms of (6.16) as

Design Example
As an example, a bifocal dual reflector antenna is designed using the procedure 
described earlier. The reflector surfaces are computed for the design parameters 
α = 4°, d/DM = 0.058, L/DM = 0.58, and P/DM = 0.154. Guidelines for choosing 
P, L, α, and d are provided in Appendix A. DM and Ds are the diameters of the 
main and subreflector, respectively. For this example, DM = 6.48 m and Ds = 1.25 
m. The resulting surfaces are described by (6.15) and (6.16) with the coefficients 
A1 = 0.308, A2 = 1.045, A3 = 5.18, C1= -0.264, C2=0.308, and C3 = -0.00525 when 
the reflector coordinates are normalized to the main reflector radius. Figure 6.2 
compares the bifocal reflector curves with those of the equivalent Cassegrain reflec­
tor. The maximum deviation in the main reflector is 1.68 cm (0.224λ at 4 GHz), 
and in the subreflector it is 0.79 cm (0.105 λ at 4 GHz). These seemingly small dif­
ferences in reflector curves make a large difference in radiation patterns.
In Figure 6.3 radiation patterns are shown for an operating frequency of 4 GHz 
and for various scan angles β. The results for an equivalent Cassegrain reflector are 
included for comparison. These patterns are obtained using numerical integration 
methods [6]. First, the surface currents on the subreflector are approximated by 
geometrical optics currents. The free space dyadic Green’s function is then inte­
grated over these currents to obtain the current distribution on the main reflector. 
Far-field patterns are then obtained from the main reflector current distribution. 
Subreflector blockage and the feed taper are not included, as they complicate the 
computing process without adding much to the conclusions reached here. From 
Figure 6.3, it is noted that for -6°< β < 6°, the variation in gain and half-power 
beamwidth for a bifocal reflector as compared to that of a Cassegrain reflector is 
1.5 dB versus 5.8 dB and 0.8°-0.9° versus 0.8°-1.5°, respectively. The side lobes 
are lower for the bifocal reflector except for the radiation patterns that are close to 
or on boresight axis.

6.2  Bifocal Dual Reflector Antennas 
187
Figure 6.4 compares the radiation pattern at 6 GHz for the same example. 
Again, the variations in gain and half-power beamwidth are much smaller for the 
bifocal reflector than for the Cassegrain reflector (2 dB versus 9.3 dB and 0.6°-0.7° 
versus 0.6°-1.2°). As expected, it is evident from Figures 6.3 and 6.4 that a bifocal 
reflector gives better radiation patterns when the scan angle is equal to the design 
scan angle α. 
Figure 6.5 compares the radiation patterns when the scan angle is equal to α. 
As expected, the bifocal reflector gives a much better pattern (higher gain, smaller 
beamwidth, and lower side lobes).

Bifocal dual reflector antenna using a circularly symmetric Cassegrain configu­
ration has also received the attention of other workers: a practical contribution by 
Kumazawa and Karikomi [7] and a parametric study by Claydon [8]. Kumazawa 
and Karikomi reported on experimental results obtained from a multibeam anten­
na they built for communications satellite. They built a seven-beam model antenna 
with 1.98m diameter and evaluated it at 50 GHz. Figure 6.6 shows their antenna. 
Figure 6.7 shows their experimental results. Measured radiation patterns of 
the antenna are shown in Figure 6.7(a). In Figure 6.7(b), antenna gain variation 
and beam direction angle as a function of primary horn position are shown. The 
measured gain variation for each beam is noted to be less than 0.55 dB. They stated 
that one can scan to ±7 beamwidths with less than 1 dB loss in gain with their

bifocal reflector. This scan range is 50 percent greater than one can achieve with a 
classical Cassegrain system, as expected.
Claydon [8] also considered the circularly symmetric bifocal dual reflector in 
Cassegrain configuration. He performed a parametric study and provided exten­
sive graphical data. His conclusions were that the bifocal dual reflector antenna is 
more useful for applications in which the beam of a large (narrow-beam) antenna 
needs to be scanned over a large angular range.
6.2.1.2  Offset Structure
The problem with circularly symmetric bifocal dual reflector antennas with Casseg­
rain structure is the blockage effect of the subreflector, which limits the achievable 
side lobe levels, which are important for satellite communications. 
Chang and Lang [9] reported on scan-corrected offset dual reflector anten­
nas. Their scan-corrected dual reflector antenna is basically designed as a bifocal 
symmetric Cassegrain dual reflector antenna discussed in the previous section. An 
offset configuration is achieved by proper tailoring of the symmetric design. Fig­
ure 6.8 shows the geometry of the scan-corrected offset dual reflector antenna. 
They chose the antenna structure suitable for satellite communications at 20 GHz 
with antenna beamwidth of 0.5°. Reflector profiles are synthesized for the case of 
α = 2°. The feeds are located in a plane defined by z = 43.6”. The antenna gain of 
each scanned beam is optimized by adjusting the tilt, rotation angle, and the aper­
ture size of the feed horn. Computed gains for various scan angles in both azimuth 
and elevation are plotted in Figure 6.9. The scan loss in azimuth is only 0.3 dB, 
even when the beam is canned to 4° (8 beamwidths). The loss is slightly asymmet­
ric in elevation due to offset geometry. The scan performance results indicate the 
superiority of bifocal dual reflector system over the classical Cassegrain system.

Mittra et al. [10] analyzed the scan-corrected offset dual reflector antenna sys­
tem of Chang and Lang [9]. They reported on the side lobe and cross-polarization 
performance; both are superior for the elevation scan as compared to azimuthal 
scan. They also observed that the scan performance is quite satisfactory in the 
range of ±8 beamwidths, indicating better performance compared with conven­
tional offset Cassegrain system.
Rappaport [11, 12] also reported on an offset bifocal dual reflector antenna. 
Unlike Chang and Lang [9], who chose symmetrically located focal points (with re­
spect to z-axis), Rappaport chose asymmetric focal points. The reason for choosing 
the asymmetric focal points is that the optimal focal locus for an offset Cassegrain 
is a curve inclined to the antenna axis [13]. In addition to choosing two asymmetri­
cally located focal points, Rappaport presented an iterative procedure to design 
three-dimensional dual reflector surfaces such that the two chosen focal points are 
true focal points for three-dimensional structure. Careful attention needs to be paid 
in choosing the aperture center position, which must be above the axis, and choos­
ing initial subreflector points. Figure 6.10 shows the locations of the symmetric 
focal points. He presented a design for perfect focusing at ±8°. Figure 6.11 shows 
the computed and experimental radiation patterns for -8°, 0°, and +8° beam scan 
for a 130λ diameter offset bifocal antenna at 36 GHz. Rappaport [12] states, “The 
offset bifocal is superior to the previous symmetric design in several aspects. The 
two focal points, rotated into a focal ‘ring’ for the symmetric case, are more nearly 
perfect foci for the offset case. The focal ring specifies the optimum locus of scan­
ning sources but does not identify a single point for one well-formed beam. The

offset design does yield a single focus where all coherent incoming rays converge. 
With no blockage, gain, side lobe performance, and noise temperature character­
istics are improved, and supporting the antenna is easier with the offset bifocal 
design.” Rappaport [12] also states, “It has been demonstrated, both analytically 
and experimentally, that this dual reflector can scan across the entire earth disk, 
±12 beamwidths in any direction, with a peak gain variation of only 3 dB and a 
first side lobe exceeding 16 dB below maximum.” However, no supporting data is 
provided except for the patterns shown in Figure 6.11, which represents the plane 
containing the focal points. It is not clear how the patterns behave in other planes.
Mizugutch and Watanabe [14] also reported on an offset bifocal reflector of 
Cassegrain type. Their design is also aimed at obtaining two perfect focal points 
for a three-dimensional structure. They discussed several different structures with 
different shaped subreflector and main reflector with two perfect focal points. Fig­
ure 6.12 shows the radiation patterns of their antenna at 11.3 and 14.3 GHz in 
the azimuth plane—the plane in which the two perfect focal points are located. In

this plane, the loss in gain is small from 0° to 10°, as expected. No data is pro­
vided for scanning in the other planes. So, having two perfect focal points may or 
may not provide wider scan over a cone angle. It appears that having perfect focal 
points may provide a bit wider scan angle in the plane in which the focal points 
are located.
6.2.2  Gregorian Configuration
Lorenzo, Rappaport, and Pino reported on both symmetric [15] and offset [16] 
bifocal reflector antenna with Gregorian configuration. Figure 6.13 shows a

two-dimensional design for the bifocal Gregorian antenna. In Gregorian configu­
ration, the subreflector has a concave shape. The two-dimensional curves for the 
main and subreflector are obtained by using iterative procedure used for classical 
bifocal reflector [5], assuming the location of the two focal points and the initial 
point on the subreflector. Instead of rotating the two-dimensional curves around 
z-axis to get a three-dimensional structure, Lorenzo et al. [15] proposed using a 
polynomial to describe the y-z profile and use points on this subreflector profile as 
new initial points to obtain a new set of two-dimensional curves. The set of these 
two-dimensional curves defines the three-dimensional surfaces for both subreflector 
and main reflector.
6.2.2.1  Circularly Symmetric Structure
For a circularly symmetrical structure, the y-z profile is expressed as a polynomial 
containing only quadratic terms. By this process, one can obtain a three-dimen­
sional dual reflector antenna with two perfect focal points for the three-dimensional 
structure. Lorenzo et al. [15] presented a design example for a symmetric Gregorian 
bifocal reflector system with 20° field of view (focal points at ±8° scan angle). Fig­
ure 6.14 shows the radiation patterns of this bifocal symmetric Gregorian antenna 
over 0–10° scan angles, which indicated well-formed beams with very little loss 
in gain. The authors claim that the Gregorian structure presents better efficiency 
characteristics. However, they did not present any patterns in the other planes. So,

it is not clear whether this design with two perfect focal points will give good per­
formance over a cone angle of 20°.
6.2.2.2 Offset Structure
Lorenzo et al. extended their procedure for symmetric bifocal reflector antennas 
with Gregorian configuration [15] to an offset [16] configuration. The offset design 
(Figure 6.15) will provide no blockage. Their design provides two perfect focal 
points for the chosen offset configuration. They provided a design for 20° field of 
view, with two focal points specified for scan angles of ±8°. Figure 6.16 shows their 
radiation patterns for zero degree and design scan angles of +8°, indicating good 
patterns at those angles. Even though they indicate that the antenna can be used to 
scan over a cone angle of ±10°, no data is provided to support their claim, especially 
in other planes.
6.3  Multifocal Dual Reflector Antennas
The purpose of this chapter is mainly to discuss the principles of bifocal and bicol­
limated dual reflector antenna systems of different configurations and their applica­
tions. However, it is appropriate to briefly mention the subject of multifocal dual 
reflector antennas [17–19] as an extension of bifocal dual reflector antennas. Only 
a very brief discussion of multifocal dual reflector antennas is included here because 
their design principles are different from those of bifocal systems. For some applica­
tions, multifocal designs may be more suitable. A multifocal antenna is an exten­
sion of the bifocal dual reflector antenna concept. In a multifocal antenna, the dual 
reflector surfaces are shaped to have multiple quasi foci. The dual reflector surfaces 
are designed by minimizing the aberrations over the antenna apertures for each 
quasi focus. The number of quasi-focal points and their distribution depends on

angle. A number of rays are traced from each focal point to the apertures, and the

errors are then evaluated. The objective function to be minimized is the weighted 
sum of both phase and amplitude errors. The reflector surfaces are determined by 
an iterative process. Albertsen et al. [17] presented two cases: one for wide-angle 
scan in a plane and another for wide-angle scan over a cone angle. For scanning 
in a plane, the quasi foci are chosen on an axis normal to z-axis. For scanning in 
a cone angle, the quasi foci are chosen by equally spacing them around the z-axis. 
The authors state that their shaping procedure improved the performance of dual 
reflector antennas significantly compared to both nonshaped and bifocal antennas. 
Nomoto et al. [18] presented a design of an offset multifocal reflector antenna suit­
able for generating multiple beams that cover the Earth from a geostationary orbit. 
They also presented some experimental results showing good antenna performance 
over a cone angle of 18° (36 beamwidths).
Bird and Sprey [19] discussed a case for scanning over a rectangular shaped 
coverage. They showed that a dual reflector system could be designed for larger 
scan in one plane compared to the orthogonal plane, if that is required.
6.4  Bicollimated Dual Reflector Antenna
As stated before, a reflector antenna’s performance is limited to a very small angular 
coverage. Conversely, a phased array antenna of the same aperture has very wide 
angular coverage, but it is expensive and difficult to build. For limited scan applica­
tions, like satellite communications, smaller arrays may be used in conjunction with 
dual reflector antennas that provide some attractive features. The system combines 
the low cost of a reflector antenna with the performance capabilities of an electroni­
cally scanned array over a limited scan range. Two classical reflector systems that 
are used with a primary phased array feed are shown in Figure 6.17. Figure 6.17(a) 
shows a Gregorian configuration, and Figure 6.17(b) shows a Cassegrain configu­
ration. In each case, a parabolic subreflector is illuminated by the near-field of a 
phased array, which in turn illuminates a larger parabolic main reflector. So, they 
are classified as a near-field fed Gregorian and near-field fed Cassegrain reflector 
systems. Between these two configurations, Gregorian system provides less spillover 
and higher gain. Fitzgerald [20] and Dragone and Gans [21] reported on near-field 
Gregorian reflector antenna that used confocal paraboloids and small array feed. 
However, one problem with this type of antenna is that its angular coverage is still 
limited.
Just like a bifocal reflector antenna [5] and a bifocal dielectric lens antenna [1, 
2] have wider angle scan capability than their single focus counterparts, a bicol­
limated Gregorian reflector antenna [22–24] has better scan capability compared 
to the confocal Gregorian reflector antenna (collimated in one direction only). The 
design presented in [22–24] applies to both symmetric and offset configurations. 
However, only the offset configuration, which eliminates feed blockage, will be 
discussed here.
The bicollimated reflector is obtained by first designing a bicollimated cylin­
drical reflector system using geometrical optics techniques and then revolving the 
cross section curves to form surfaces of revolution. Selected parts of these surfaces 
will form an offset reflector configuration.

Bifocal and Bicollimated Dual Reflector Antennas
Figure 6.18 is a central cross-section illustrating the principle of a bicollimated 
dual reflector antenna. The antenna comprises a main reflector, a subreflector, and 
a phased array feed. Figure 6.19 shows the rays used to calculate the discrete points 
on both reflectors. The phased array can radiate a plane wave beam in any direc­
tion over a large scanning range. For instance, a beam can be radiated at an angle β 
with respect to the z-axis. This beam is represented by the two solid lines emanat­
ing from the feed array in Figure 6.18. The phased array is also capable of radiating 
a beam at an angle -β as represented by the two dotted lines emanating from the 
feed array. The cross sections of the main and subreflector are shaped such that 
the antenna system is bicollimated. This means that all the rays in an initial beam 
either at β or -β direction be reflected between the subreflector and main reflector 
into a final beam at -α and +α with respect to the antenna axis. It is shown later in 
this chapter that only a series of points and slopes (or tangents) at those points on 
the cross sections of the reflector can be obtained. Using these data, the reflector 
cross sections are represented completely by best-fit polynomials. This polynomial 
representation is used in computing the aperture phase errors when the antenna 
beam is scanned to different angles by scanning the feed array. Three-dimensional 
ray tracing procedure is used in analyzing the aperture phase errors.

6.4.1  Design Procedure
In Figure 6.19, the z-axis is the antenna axis of rotational symmetry. The subreflec­
tor is chosen to be perpendicular to the z-axis at z = z1 = P, where P is the separation 
between the origin and the subreflector. In addition, the path length between the 
reflected phase front B and the corresponding incident phase front A is assumed to 
be L. Similarly, the path length between the phase fronts C and D is also equal to L.
Knowing the initial point (x1, z1), and the slope at that point on the subreflec­
tor, one can determine the main reflector point (x1′, z1′) and the slope at that point 
by applying geometrical optics principles to the initial ray incident on the subreflec­
tor at the point (x1, z1). Once the slope and location of the point (x1′, z1′) on the 
main reflector is determined, the procedure is reversed to find point (x2, z2) and the 
corresponding slope on the subreflector.
Thereafter the procedure is repeated but using the subreflector’s already de­
termined second point (x2, z2) as a starting point to determine a second point on 
the main reflector and then a third point on the subreflector. Further repetitions 
will determine the locations and slopes of a finite sequence of points (xk, zk) on the 
subreflector and points (xk′, zk′) on the main reflector.
The mathematical formalism required for this iterative process is hereafter de­
rived on generalized points on each reflector as shown in central cross section in 
Figure 6.19. An initial ray (solid line) oriented at an angle β is incident on the sub­
reflector at a generalized point (xk, zk) and slope that were previously determined. 
The orientation γk of the reflected intermediate ray relative to z-axis is determined 
by applying Snell’s law. The intermediate ray is reflected at the point (xk′, zk′) on 
Figure 6.18  Central cross section of a bicollimated Gregorian reflector antenna. (© 1984 IEEE.

initial values, for k = 1, are z1 = P and x1 = 0. From Figure 6.19, it can be noted that 
γ1 = β. Therefore, γ1′ is not needed in (6.24) to find γ1.
Reversing the procedure for the final ray (dotted line) at α produces an in­
termediate ray at an orientation γ′k+1, reflecting from the point (xk+1, zk+1) on the 
subreflector and corresponding to an initial ray oriented at -β. The location (xk+1, 
zk+1) and the slope at that point are thus determined. The mathematical relation­

Bifocal and Bicollimated Dual Reflector Antennas
Starting with the initial point (x1, z1) and the angle γ1(=β) and making use of 
the first and then the second set of formulas and continuing the process, a series of 
points and slopes on each reflector surface can be found in succession.
6.4.2  Polynomial Approximation
The design procedure discussed in the previous section gives a finite number of 
points and an equal number of slopes on the reflector surfaces. In order to define 
the reflector surfaces completely, it is necessary to use an approximation. It is con­
venient to approximate the reflector cross sections by best-fit polynomials. Since the 
reflectors are axially symmetric, only even powers are required. The reflector cross 
sections are represented by the polynomials

where xs and zs are the subreflector coordinates, and xM and yM are the main reflec­
tor coordinates.
If the number of data points available limits the degree of the polynomial, the 
known slopes on the reflector curves can be used to improve the accuracy.
6.4.3  Equivalent Gregorian Confocal Reflector
To compare the reflector shapes and performance of the bicollimated reflector sys­
tem with a confocal reflector system, it is necessary to define an equivalent confo­
cal reflector system. The equivalence is established here by first choosing the main 
reflector shape of the confocal system as an equivalent parabola by selecting the 
first two terms of the polynomial representation of the bicollimated reflector and 
then choosing the spacing (measured along the reflector axis) between the confocal 
reflectors equal to that of the bicollimated configuration. The former is justified 
because, when specific examples are considered, the main reflector cross-section of 
the bicollimated configuration approximates a parabola (the higher order terms in 
(6.33) are very small). Therefore, an equivalent main reflector is defined by

where Fs=A0+B0-A1/4 is the focal length of the equivalent parabolic reflector.
There are other ways of defining an equivalent confocal reflector. However, the 
one defined in this section is more appropriate for comparing the reflector shapes. 

6.4  Bicollimated Dual Reflector Antenna 
203
In the next section, we will consider the limiting confocal reflector that may also be 
considered as an equivalent confocal reflector and will be used in comparing scan­
ning performance. However, there is no need to find precise equivalence (if there is 
such a thing) because small changes in the Gregorian antenna parameters do not 
appreciably influence its scanning performance as long as the confocal condition is 
not violated. Another point that should be noted is that at the outset it may appear 
that an equivalent confocal reflector can be obtained simply by taking the first two 
terms in the polynomial representation of the bicollimated reflector. However, the 
main and sub reflectors so obtained will not form a confocal set.
6.4.4  Limiting Gregorian Confocal Reflector 
Consider a set of bicollimated reflectors that are designed by keeping L, P, and 
M = β/α the same but change α and β. As α approaches zero, the limiting bicol­
limated reflector degenerates to a confocal reflector. This limiting case (α = 0) is 
called limiting Gregorian confocal reflector. This equivalent confocal reflector con­
figuration will be used later on to compare the scanning performance of a set of 
bicollimated reflectors that are designed using the same values for L, P, and M. It 
is not difficult to see that M represents the magnification of the limiting Gregorian 
confocal reflector, that L (the path length between the incident and the radiating 
wave-fronts for an on axis beam for the confocal reflector) is equal to twice the 
spacing between the main and subreflector, and that P is the distance between the 
origin and the subreflector. Then, it can be shown [23] that the limiting parabolic 
subreflector is given by the equation

6.4.5  Phase Error Analysis
In the classical near-field Gregorian system [20], it is known that the amplitude 
distribution applied to the feed array is reproduced over the main aperture without 
alteration. For values of α that are of practical interest, the bicollimated reflector 
system does not deviate much from an equivalent classical near-field Gregorian 
system. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the main aperture amplitude 
distribution is the same as that of the feed array. However, the aperture phase er­
rors are different in the two systems. The purpose of this section is to analyze the 
aperture phase errors and show the advantages of the bicollimated reflector system. 
Figure 6.20 shows the geometry used in analyzing aperture phase errors. The aper­
ture phase errors are found by assuming that a plane wave is incident on the main

reflector at an angle θ and φ, which also corresponds to the main beam direction. 
Path-length errors on the aperture are determined from the path length between the 
incident wave-front and the corresponding feed array wave-front, as discussed in 
Appendix B. The path-length error on the aperture is given by

Reflector surfaces are obtained by rotating the cross sections about the z-axis 
and choosing only selected parts. Figure 6.21 shows the geometry and the antenna 
parameters of the offset bicollimated reflector, which is chosen as an example. The 
main reflector surface is chosen so that it is circular when projected into the xy-
plane. The main aperture is assumed to be completely utilized over the scanning 
range of interest. The corresponding illuminated areas of the feed array and the 
subreflector surface may change with scan angle. For the example under consider­
ation, the main reflector diameter D = 1.6P, and the main reflector is offset from 
the z-axis by 0.3P to eliminate blockage due to the subreflector when the beam is 
scanned below the z-axis.
By use of the three-dimensional ray tracing method developed in Appendix B, 
a computer program was devised to determine the aperture phase errors when the 
beam is scanned to different scan angles. Using that program, path-length errors 
were obtained over the whole aperture. However, only phase errors in the xz-plane 
are shown in Figure 6.22, as the errors are similar in other planes. The solid curves 
belong to the bicollimated reflector. As expected, the aperture errors for θs = 3° 
(α = 3°) are zero. However, for θs = 0° (on axis beam) the bicollimated reflector has 
aperture errors whose magnitude increases toward the edges of the aperture. For 
comparison, aperture errors are computed for an equivalent confocal reflector and 
are shown as dashed curves in Figure 6.22. For the confocal reflector, the aperture 
errors are zero for θs = 0 and increase with θs. The maximum errors appear toward 
the edges of aperture.
For each scan angle, the maximum error on the full aperture is determined by 
using the data shown in Figure 6.22 and similar data obtained for other planes. 
This maximum path-length error normalized to aperture diameter is plotted in 
Figure 6.23 as a function of the scan angle when the main beam is scanned in

φ= 0° plane. For the confocal reflector, the maximum path-length error increases 
monotonically with the scan angle, whereas the path-length error for the bicolli­
mated reflector decreases with the scan angle and becomes zero for θ = α (3° in the 
example) and then increases monotonically with the scan angle. For a maximum 
normalized path-length error of 0.0011, Figure 6.23 shows that the confocal reflec­
tor can be scanned up to 2.7°, and the bicollimated reflector can be scanned up to 
4°. Therefore, the bicollimated reflector has about 48 percent more scanning range 
in φ =0° plane than the scanning range of an equivalent confocal reflector. Figures 
6.24 and 6.25 show similar results for scanning in φ =90° and 180° planes. Figure 
6.26 shows the complete scanning ranges, for a maximum normalized path-length 
error of 0.0011, for both confocal and bicollimated reflector antennas. The results 
show that the bicollimated reflector has about 45 percent more scanning range 
than an equivalent confocal reflector.
Keeping L = 2.5P, D = 1.6P, and β/α = 3, aperture phase errors are calculated 
for different values of α (and hence β) including the limiting case of α = 0 (which 
corresponds to an equivalent confocal configuration). Figure 6.27 shows the maxi­
mum path-length error on the aperture versus scan angle when the beam is scanned 
in φ = 0° plane. Using these results, one can obtain the curves shown in Figure 
6.28, which relate maximum scan angle for a specified maximum path-length er­
ror on the aperture or vice versa. These curves can be used to choose an optimum 
value of α for a specified maximum path-length error on the aperture by noting the 
maximum scan angle θm for specified phase error and then choosing α ≅ θm/1.45. 
Figures 6.29 and 6.30 show the maximum aperture errors versus scan angles when

the beam is scanned in the xz-plane and yz-plane, respectively. The curves are not 
symmetric in xz-plane, as expected, because of the offset configuration. However, 
they are symmetric in yz-plane, as expected.
Because of the large blockage expected due to the feed and subreflector, a sym­
metric bicollimated reflector cannot be used in practice. However, one can calculate 
the aperture phase errors (ignoring the blockage effects) and compare them with 
those of the offset configurations. Figure 6.31 shows the maximum aperture error 
as a function of scan angle, when scanned in xz-plane. Because of the symmetry, 
the results will be the same when scanned in other planes. Comparing these results 
with the results of offset configurations given in Figures 6.29 and 6.30, one may 
conclude that an offset configuration does not result in any noticeable degradation 
in scanning performance when compared to a symmetric configuration. 
6.5  Bifocal and Bicollimated Dual Reflector Antenna Applications
In addition to using bifocal and bicollimated dual reflector antennas for multibeam 
and wide-angle scanning in satellite communications and radar applications, some 
authors have suggested other applications. Dell-Imagine [25] has proposed a bifocal 
dual reflector line source, which would be useful as a line source in a limited scan 
array. He built and reported a model using a triple layer pillbox antenna. The design 
of two-dimensional curves used for main and sub reflectors in the pillbox comes

from the standard design of bifocal Cassegrain dual reflector. The experimental 
results showed good performance. Since the pillbox is very thin (less than λ/2), the 
resulting line source can be used as an elevation line source in an azimuth-scanning 
array.
Another unique application of bifocal and bicollimated dual reflector antenna 
concepts is to rapidly scan and refocus a terahertz (THz) beam for high-resolution 
standoff imaging applications. A reflector antenna system was proposed [26] and 
demonstrated [27] using a confocal Gregorian geometry with a small mechanical 
rotating mirror. In this system, the subreflector is a paraboloid, and the main reflec­
tor surface is an ellipsoid, in order to focus in the antenna near-field. This system 
is called the confocal ellipsoidal gregorian reflector system (CEGRS). Garcia-Pino 
et al. [28] presented an innovative antenna design for this unique application using 
bifocal and bicollimated dual reflector antenna concepts. They presented a system 
that they call the bifocal elliptical gregorian reflector system (BEGRS). This system 
is similar to CEGRS except that the subreflector and main reflector are shaped 
using bifocal and bicollimated concepts. The resulting system is able to achieve fo­
cusing in a focal ring placed on an arbitrary plane parallel to the antenna aperture, 
which can be considered as the target for the imaging system. The bifocal system 
(BEGRS) increased the field of view by 50 percent over CEGRS.
Bicollimated dual reflector antenna has received attention by several authors 
as a preferred or better approach for multibeam communications satellite antenna 
[29], for space-based radar applications [30], and in general a better approach to

Appendix A: Determination of the Parameters P, L, α, and d
In the design of the bifocal reflector, it was assumed that the parameters P, L, α, and 
d are known. However, in any practical problem, these parameters should be cho­
sen judiciously; otherwise, the result may be unrealistic spacing between the main 
reflector and subreflector and/or unrealistic subreflector diameter (may be too large 
or too small). Some guidelines are given here to find an initial set of parameters to 
satisfy certain design goals. Then, the main effect of changing these parameters is 
discussed so that the appropriate parameters can be changed, if needed, and a new 
design attempted. Since the bifocal reflector design procedure is very simple (only 
algebraic equations are to be solved), it is very easy to repeat the design procedure

with several sets of parameters until the required spacing between the reflectors and 
the required subreflector diameter is obtained.
The design of a dual reflector antenna depends on several requirements, which 
may include gain, beamwidth, feed location, spacing between the reflectors, and 
required scanning range. The gain and beamwidth depend mainly on the main 
reflector diameter. Therefore, they do not enter the design procedure directly if 
all the linear dimensions are normalized to the diameter of the main reflector. The 
parameter P is determined from the feed location requirement. The parameter L 
is determined from the requirement on spacing between the two reflectors. The 
design scan angle α is determined from the scanning requirement or the off-axis 
angle where the best possible pattern is required. Similar to a Cassegrain system 
[32], the required feed displacement d depends on the scan angle α. However, for 
a given α, our investigation showed that the required subreflector size is inversely 
proportional to d. Therefore, the parameter d is chosen such that the subreflector 
size will not exceed a specified value.
The following effects should be kept in mind when changing the initial values 
of the parameters P, L, α, and d. If P is changed, the spacing between the subre­
flector and the feed is changed. Changing L mainly affects the spacing between the 
two reflectors. For a given α, decreasing the value of d requires a larger subreflec­
tor diameter and vice versa. Similarly, for a given d, increasing α requires a larger 
subreflector diameter and vice versa.
Appendix B: Three-Dimensional Ray Tracing Procedure
A ray tracing procedure is used to compute aperture phase errors for the bicol­
limated reflector antenna. Figure 6.20 of this paper is used to illustrate the pro­
cedure. First we compute the path length of a general ray from a point A on the 
incident wavefront through a point B (xm, ym, zm) on the main reflector and a point 
C (xs, ys, zs) on the subreflector, and finally to a corresponding point D (x′, y′) in 
the feed plane. The equation of the subreflector is assumed to be a sixth-degree 
polynomial and is given as

7.1  Introduction 
Communications satellites providing high throughput require high gain antennas 
producing spot beams over a domestic coverage area or the entire field of view of 
the Earth. A ground station simultaneously communicating with a single or mul­
tiple satellites requires high-performance antenna system over a wide field of view. 
The increased frequency reuse in such applications also sets stringent side lobe, 
main-beam roll-off, pointing, beam scan loss, and cross polarization requirements 
over the entire coverage region. Reflector antennas are most commonly used in 
satellite communications systems due to their several advantages over phased ar­
rays. These antennas are light in weight, less expensive, and simple in construction, 
and have low power dissipation. A feed array located in the focal plane or over an 
optimum feed loci surface generates multiple beams. However, the performance of 
conventional array-fed reflector antennas is limited by phase aberrations resulting 
from the displaced feed elements. Over the years, several configurations of both 
single and dual reflectors have been described to reduce the beam distortion and 
gain degradation due to scan.
Compared with single parabolic reflectors, dual reflector antennas have lon­
ger equivalent focal length to antenna diameter ratio (F/D) and provide additional 
design variables that help to improve cross polarization and beam scanning per­
formance. Fitgerald [1, 2] has shown that Confocal paraboloids in Cassegrain and 
Gregorian arrangements fed by small phased array have some attractive features 
in limited scan applications. Chen and Tsandoulas [3] have described the combi­
nation of active time delayed small array and a confocal Gregorian offset reflec­
tor forming a space feed for wide band phased array antennas. This wideband 
space feed is shown to offer better gain performance, lower amplitude quantiza­
tion lobes, and grating lobes in comparison with the conventional sub-arrayed 
wideband corporate feeds. For satellite applications, Dragone and Gans [4] have

presented “imaging” reflector arrangements with properly sized and located feed 
array to generate scanning beams over United States. The scanning capability of 
array-fed Gregorian reflector antenna is limited by phase errors in the image ap­
erture plane. Shaping of the confocal reflectors or phase compensation of the feed 
elements helps to improve the scan characteristics. Section 7.2 discusses design of 
confocal antenna systems. 
Conventional dual reflectors, Cassegrain and Gregorian, in offset configura­
tion can be designed to provide zero cross-polarization [5–7] for linear polariza­
tion. This is achieved if the reflectors and feed can be arranged satisfying the fol­
lowing condition:

where γ is the angle from the main reflector axis to the subreflector axis and ψ is the 
angle from the subreflector axis to the feed axis. M is the magnification factor that 
determines the subreflector type, with the following sign convention: (a) M > 1, the 
subreflector is the convex branch of a hyperboloid; (b) 0 < M < 1, the subreflector 
is the concave side of a hyperboloid; and (c) M < -1, the subreflector is an ellipsoid.
Beam scan performance (gain loss versus number of beamwidths scanned) of 
dual offset Gregorian antenna, with a diameter of 91λ has been computed by Ak­
agawa and DiFonzo [8]. It was shown that the scan loss curve follows that of the 
equivalent parabola for small scan angles only. A multifeed dual offset Cassegrain 
reflector antenna, with a ±4° field of view, for European coverage was presented 
by Doro et al. [9]. A theoretical analysis of aberrations in Cassegrain and Gre­
gorian antennas was performed by Dragone [10]. He derived the various aber­
ration components due to astigmatism, coma, and so on; their effect on aperture 
efficiency was shown; and the conditions that optimize performance were given. 
These investigations have shown that for linear polarization, conventional dual 
offset Gregorian and Cassegrain antennas are difficult to design for no blockage 
and low cross polarization for large scan angles. Shaping of reflector surfaces can 
help to reduce the scan aberrations to some extent as reported in [11]. In order to 
achieve both low scan losses and low cross polarization over larger scan angles, 
two variants of offset Cassegrain design have been proposed and analyzed [5, 6, 
12,13]. They employ offset concave hyperboloidal subreflectors (compared to a 
convex hyperboloid as in a classical Cassegrain reflector system) that are confocal 
with offset paraboloidal main reflectors and are called front fed offset Cassegrain 
(FFOC) and side fed offset Cassegrain (SFOC) antennas. Chang and Prata Jr. [14] 
referred to these antennas as offset Dragonian reflectors in [14] where they present 
a complete step-by-step geometrical optics based design procedure. Granet [15] 
also described a simple procedure for the design of these antennas from combina­
tions of prescribed geometric parameters. In this Chapter, Section 7.3 presents scan 
performance of SFOC and FFOC reflector antennas.
There has been a lot of interest in designing satellites with reconfigurable pay­
loads and antenna systems. Two topics related to this subject, nonfocused reflector 
antennas and reconfigurable reflector antennas, are discussed in Sections 7.4 and 
7.5, respectively. With recent demand for Ku-/Ka-band satellite communications 
on the move, axially displaced ellipse reflector antenna has received lot of attention

for use in small Earth stations. This antenna configuration is discussed in Section 
7.6. 
7.2  Confocal Antenna System
The confocal antenna system is a hybrid antenna that employs phased array feed for 
beam scanning and reconfiguration, and utilizes reflector system to achieve signifi­
cant increase in gain with a smaller phased array. The reflector system comprises a 
parabolic main reflector and a parabolic subreflector with a common focal point 
[16]. The dual-reflector system employs an offset configuration to avoid blockage. 
Figure 7.1 illustrates the concept of the confocal antenna system. The feed is placed 
in the near-field of the subreflector so that array amplitude and phase distributions 
are transferred to the subreflector. The subreflector creates a magnified image of 
the phased array on to the main reflector. The magnification M is a key design pa­
rameter and is given by:

where Ge is the gain of the phased array element, N is the number of elements in 
the array, and M is the magnification factor of the confocal antenna. The main 
advantage of the confocal antenna is that the number of elements in phased array 
could be reduced by a factor of M2 relative to the number of elements in a phased 
array without the confocal optics. The back-end electronics and beamformer will be 
much simpler with the confocal antenna. The disadvantages are that (a) the phased 
array has to scan M times the actual beam scan, and (b) increased scan loss due to 
the fact that the effective element size is M times the physical size of the element. 
The phased array excitations can be synthesized easily by using conjugate matching 
of the fields in the plane of the phased array by impinging a plane wave in the di­
rection of interest and calculating the amplitude and phase distributions [16]. This 
procedure will be quite useful to compensate for the reflector’s surface errors and 
other types of nonrandom errors in the confocal system.
The difficulty with the confocal system is that grating lobes outside the scan re­
gion cannot be avoided due to the reason that the primary array has to scan M times 
the secondary scan region. For applications requiring interference mitigation or an­
tijamming, these grating lobes have to be suppressed. Dragone [17, 18] proposed a 
flat plate with a circular hole or iris placed along the focal plane with the center of 
the hole coinciding with the common focal point of the confocal antenna. The di­
ameter of the iris depends on the illumination angle on the main reflector and must 
be large enough to minimize the diffraction effects. The focal-plane metallic screen 
blocks all the grating lobes outside the secondary scan region, while the iris in the 
metallic screen allows the beam scanning over the coverage region. The iris acts like 
a spatial filter blocking the electromagnetic fields outside the iris and thus blocks the 
electromagnetic fields outside the scan region in the far-field of the confocal reflector 
antenna system. The radiation patterns with and without iris plate are illustrated 
in Figure 7.2 [19]. The iris cleans all the grating lobes outside the scan region and 
improves the potential interference/jamming mitigation. Typical radiation patterns 
of a confocal antenna for multiple beam applications are illustrated in Figure 7.3. A 
low-level BFN was employed to generate the multiple beams.
The design parameters for the confocal antenna system are as follows:
••
Main reflector diameter;
••
Magnification factor;
••
Subreflector diameter;
••
Focal lengths of main and subreflectors;
••
Location of the feed array;
••
Element spacing;
••
Number of array elements.
Main reflector and subreflector diameters for the confocal antenna are typi­
cally oversized compared to conventional antennas. This is mainly to minimize the 
scan losses for the beams scanned near the edge of the scan region. Minimum size 
of the main reflector is given by

where λ is the wavelength at the lowest frequency of operation, and θ3 is the half 
power beamwidth for the bore sight beam. The main reflector focal length depends 
on the scan region and a large F/D of > 1.2 is often selected to minimize the scan 
loss. The magnification factor in the range 2.5 to 4.0 is typical, and it depends on 
the scan region. For large scan regions of more than +/- 7 beamwidths, a lower M 
close to 2.5 is a good choice, but for smaller scan regions M close to 3.5 is preferred 
to minimize the feed array complexity. The subreflector focal length is the ratio of

where fincr = 2 π/2n and n is the number of bits in the digital phase shifter, λh is the

angle. Once the element spacing is chosen, the number of elements in the array can 
be calculated based on the bore sight gain of the antenna, M, element gain, and 
antenna losses. The confocal antenna can be designed efficiently for limited scan 
applications, but is not practical for medium and high scan applications such as 
global coverage for geostationary satellites due to significant increase in scan losses 
and the need for large number of elements in the array.

The SFOC reflector antenna geometry is presented in Figure 7.4. The subreflector 
is a portion of a hyperbola, the main reflector is a portion of a parabola, and they 
are fed from the side. The subreflector and main reflector are arranged so that the 
focal point of the main reflector is coincident with the focal point on the concave 
side of the hyperbola. The focus F1 is the virtual focus of the hyperbola. In the 
transmit mode of operation, the feed illumination (from focus F2) is incident on the 
concave side of the subreflector, redirected toward the main reflector and then di­
rected toward the desired coverage as shown in Figure 7.4(a). Even though the main 
reflector and subreflector focal lengths are very large, the antenna configuration is 
quite compact. The large field of view requires the subreflector size to be about that 
of the main reflector.
It is well known that five independent geometrical parameters completely define 
compensated dual reflector antennas, and the remaining parameters can be derived 
using these five parameters. Chang and Prata [14] have selected D (diameter of the 
main reflector), θe (feed illumination angle to subreflector), θc (tilt angle between 
Figure 7.4   (a) SFOC reflector antenna; (b) generic Dragonian antenna geometry with parameters 
from [14]. |θc| ~ 90° corresponds to side-fed configuration.

main reflector axis and feed axis), l (distance between main and subreflectors), and 
α (tilt angle between subreflector axis and feed axis) as starting parameters in the 
design of Dragonian antennas, Figure7.4(b). Granet [15] has presented alternate 
options of starting parameters that can be used in their design. In this study, the 
following parameters are used in Ticra’s GRASP software tool to design SFOC and 
FFOC reflector antennas:
••
D: Diameter of the main reflector;
••
F: Focal length of the main reflector;
••
c: Half-distance between the focal points of the subreflector;
••
e: Eccentricity of the subreflector;
••
γ: The angle from the main reflector axis to the subreflector axis.
The side-fed design example of Chang and Prata [14] was chosen in this study. 
The SFOC antenna geometrical parameters are as follows: D = 2.727m, F = 11.1m, 
c = 7.601m, e = -2.067, and γ = 65°. The equivalent focal length for this configu­
ration is 5.18m. The subreflector size is 2.36m × 2.28m. The antenna is fed by 
linearly polarized Gaussian feed with a taper of -12 dB at the illumination angle of 
15°. The frequency of operation is assumed to be 11 GHz. The analysis is carried 
out using the GRASP software (model shown in Figure 7.5). The calculated peak 
directivity of the SFOC design example is 48.9 dBi and the 3 dB beam width is 
0.68°. The peak cross polarization is below 60 dB below the peak copolarization. 
The antenna efficiency is about 78 percent. The far field pattern in the principal 
plane is shown in Figure 7.6. 
To evaluate the scan performance of SFOC, the nominal beam is scanned by 
changing the position of the feed horn on a flat plane. As the feed for the SFOC is 
relatively larger in size, the feed element separation is chosen to be 0.15m. This re­
sults in a far-field beam-to-beam spacing of 1.63°. Figure 7.7 shows the calculated 
gain loss for scan angles up to about 9 degrees in sideward scan direction. It is to 
be noted that scan performance is generally symmetric with respect to the center 
beam at (0, 0) and better than a single reflector or a conventional dual-reflector

antenna. Table 7.1 provides the calculated directivity of SFOC antenna for differ­
ent scan angles. It is noted that the maximum scan loss of this particular SFOC 
design is about 3 dB.
Figure 7.8 shows the far field contour patterns of the SFOC antenna in various 
scan directions. In general, the scanned beams possess good circularity. To create 
contiguous multiple beams, three or four reflector antennas illuminated by multiple 
feeds are required.
The SFOC antenna is widely used in compact antenna test ranges. A typical 
SFOC antenna configuration used in test ranges is shown Figure 7.9. The sub- and 
main reflectors are about the same size. Serrations (not shown in figure) are used 
at the edges of main reflector and subreflector edges to minimize the diffraction 
effects at low frequencies. A feed baffle is typically used near the feed to avoid the 
direct illumination from the feed in the quiet-zone region.
The FFOC geometry is shown in Figure 7.10. As with the SFOC, the subreflec­
tor is a portion of a hyperbola and the main reflector is a portion of a parabola. 
However, the feed is placed to the front side of sub- and main reflectors. In other 
words, the feed is disposed on the principal radiating side of the main reflector.
The FFOC antenna is designed to be of the same size of the SFOC antenna. 
Its other geometrical parameters are as follows: D = 2.727m, F = 3m, c = 1.85m, 
e = -2.1, γ = 123.6°. The equivalent focal length is 3.31m. The subreflector size is 
2.28m × 1.55m. The antenna is fed by linearly polarized Gaussian feed with a taper 
of -12 dB at the illumination angle of 23.2°. The frequency of operation is 11 GHz. 
The GRASP analysis model is in Figure 7.11.

The calculated peak directivity of the FFOC design example is 48.8 dBi and 
the 3 dB beam width is 0.68°. The peak cross polarization is under 50 dB below 
the peak copolarization. The antenna efficiency is about 77 percent. The far-field 
pattern in the principal plane is shown in Figure 7.12. 
As with SFOC antenna, the boresight beam of FFOC antenna is scanned by 
changing the position of the feed horn on a flat plane to evaluate its scan perfor­
mance. The feed element separation is assumed to be 0.1m, which results in a far-
field beam-to-beam spacing of 1.63°. Figure 7.13 shows the calculated gain loss for 
scan angles up to about 9 degrees in sideward scan direction. It is to be noted that 
scan performance is not symmetric with respect to the center beam at (0, 0). Table 
7.2 provides the computed directivity for different feed positions corresponding 
to different scan angles. It is noted that the maximum scan loss of this particular 
FFOC design is quite large, particularly in positive scan angles. Downward and 
upward feed scan patterns are elliptical in shape instead of circular, and the sid­
elobe scan performance is significantly degraded, mainly due to the nonoptimized

7.4  Nonfocused Reflector Antenna
The nonfocused reflector (NFR) antenna has been introduced by Rao et al. [21, 
22] for mobile communication satellite applications. Typical MSS antennas em­
ploy large mesh reflectors using single reflector imaging optics where feed array is 
slightly displaced from the focal plane. This conventional antenna employs para­
bolic reflector either solid or mesh type and the feed array needs to be defocused 
so that element beams (secondary beams with single feed element) are broadened, 
which allows use of overlapping feed array instead of single feed for generation of 
multiple beams in the far-field. The limitation with the conventional system is that 
it provides only small magnification and still requires a large number of elements 
in the feed array. Another disadvantage is poor scan capability, since the reflector 
geometry is not optimal and has inferior cross-polar isolation. 
The concept of nonfocused reflector antenna is illustrated in Figure 7.15. A 
quadratic phase is introduced on an offset parabolic reflector in order to broaden 
the element when the reflector is fed with multiple beams. The quadratic phase is 
achieved by closing in or opening up the parabolic reflector surface shape. Clos­
ing-in surface is preferred since the beam will be less dispersive compared to the

reflector antenna in various scan directions.

opening-up surface. The feed array is located in the focal-plane of the starting 
paraboloid, and hence the NFR scans better than the conventional single reflector 
imaging antenna. The main advantage of NFR is that the element beams can be 
broadened significantly by two to three times compared to parabolic reflector. This 
results in a significant reduction in the number of feed array elements by a factor of 
four to nine, depending on the extent of the maximum quadratic phase introduced 
to the planar wavefront in the aperture plane. Reducing the number of elements re­
duces the cost of the feed array and RF electronics significantly. The NFR antenna 
is suitable for several L-band, S-band, C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band applications 
using a smaller solid reflector or larger mesh reflector. Some of the practical appli­
cations of the NFR antenna include the following:
••
Contoured beam antenna where the satellite can be reconfigured on-orbit to 
provide coverage over multiple orbit locations based on operator require­
ments to replace an ailing satellite or provide the ability to reconfigure beam 
shape;
••
Continuous reconfiguration of the beam as required by the satellites in the 
highly inclined elliptical orbit (HIEO) for digital radio satellite applications 
at low frequencies;
••
Multiple overlapping beams for mobile satellite and personal communica­
tions satellite applications.
A reconfigurable antenna providing flexible coverage over CONUS is illus­
trated in Figure 7.16. It employs a 12m reflector antenna using NFR requiring only 
37 elements in the feed array. The element beams over CONUS are shown in Figure

system block diagram is shown in Figure 7.17. The transmit feed array is active and 
employs “phase-only” synthesis for beam reconfiguration of the beam. Computed 
contoured beam plots over CONUS showing 90º yaw compensation for an extreme 
case is illustrated in Figure 7.18. The beam shape and the minimum directivity are 
maintained over the large yaw angle compensation. Minimum edge-of-coverage 
gain of 30 dBi is achieved for both yaw angles of 0º and 90º.
Advanced mobile antenna systems for geostationary applications require us to 
generate high-gain spot beams, medium-gain regional beams, and low-gain global 
beams from the same antenna at both transmit and receive bands. The NFR an­
tenna schematic is shown in Figure 7.19, where each element signals are diplexed 
between transmit and receive bands. The beam forming is performed at low level 
and is not shown in the schematic. Computed beam patterns for spot, regional, and 
global beams are shown in Figure 7.20. Minimum gain values of 40.1 dBi, 30.3 dBi, 
and 20.5 dBi are achieved for the spot, regional, and global beams, respectively.

changes. As the lifetimes of telecommunications satellites are continuously increas­
ing, there is a growing need for antenna systems that can be configured in orbit. 
If the satellite is relocated to another longitude, then it is highly desirable that the 
antenna system should have some flexibility to adapt to the new mission require­
ments. Reconfigurable antenna systems can be realized by using phased arrays or 
array-fed reflectors with variable beam forming networks. However, these solutions 
are complex, heavy, and costly. In-orbit reconfigurable reflector antennas have been 
the subject several research projects for more than 20 years. The technologies inves­
tigated can be classified into two groups: (1) mechanically reconfigurable reflector 
surfaces, and (2) mechanically movable (steering and rotation) reflector systems.
The most common technique used to obtain a satellite antenna radiation pat­
tern to a region on Earth is to use a single feed with a shaped surface reflector sys­
tem (single or dual reflectors). In other words, by varying the optical path between 
the feed and different points on the reflector surfaces, desired radiation patterns 
can be achieved. A number of attempts to realize reconformable reflector surface 
have been made. One of the techniques involves actively changing the mesh of 
interwoven flexible wires supported at a number of control points. Computer con­
trolled actuators at specific points on the back of a reflector surface were imple­
mented to achieve desired reflector surface changes resulting in radiation pattern 
reconfiguration. A theoretical description of the operation of this kind of reflector

was presented by Pontoppidan [23]. Some of the challenges with practical imple­
mentation of reconfigurable surface are space compatibility of actuators, interface

between reflector surface and actuators, and mathematical modeling and synthesis 
of reflector shapes. More recently, reflectarrays have received attention for provid­
ing reconfiguration of beams by replacing the conventional subreflector with an 
array of elements connected to phase delay lines. The main drawback is the band­
width limitation of the reflectarray. The in-orbit modification of the phase shift 
to array elements is implemented by using RF MEMS switches. However, these 
developments have not yet led to fully satisfactory results.
The most straightforward way of satellite service for several coverage regions 
is through a steerable spot beam, either circular or elliptical. To meet this demand, 
reconfigurable antennas realized by steering and rotation of reflectors are often 
used by satellite operators. This approach is much simpler compared to mechanical 
reconfiguration of reflector surfaces. Typical examples of Ku- and Ka-band steer­
able beams designed for Amos-3 and Amos-5 communications satellites [24] are 
shown in Figure 7.21. Military satellites (e.g., WGS series) also employ steerable 
spot beams for flexible service.
The steerable circular or elliptical spot beams are typically realized by space­
craft deck or top floor mounted reflector antenna systems. Early designs (e.g., In­
telsat V to VII series) used single offset reflector antenna-based configurations that 
have some disadvantages (higher cross polarization and higher side lobes). How­
ever, they are preferred when space and accommodation constraints on the space­
craft are severe. This can be achieved by rotating the reflector only with the two-
axis gimble placed behind the reflector at the aperture center. The feed assembly is 
located at a fixed position. For better RF performance, both the reflector and feed

plexed feed array elements.

can be arranged to steer together anywhere over the entire Earth disk seen from 
the satellite (corresponding to a scan range of ±8.7° for GEO). However, when the 
entire antenna system is mechanically steered, it is necessary to use flexible wave­
guides to connect the feed and transponder components. 
For MEO constellation, like O3b satellites, the scan range requirement to cover 
the full Earth is about ±25°. Each of O3b satellites is equipped with 12 Ka-band 
steerable antennas. MDA Corporation has developed a low-cost antenna system

consisting of a steerable center-fed shaped reflector antenna and a fixed feed chain 
[25]. The center-fed reflector geometry with small focal length was chosen to avoid 
field-of-view issues with adjacent antennas. As the feed and its support struts are 
in the RF field, accurate MoM-based modeling has been implemented in the design 
process. The steerable reflector has been shaped to optimize RF performance over 
the entire Earth coverage with 25 possible steering positions. A two-axis gimbal, 
including two compact rotary attenuators and calibration switches, is specially de­
signed and qualified for this mission. 
It is well known that dual offset Gregorian reflector antennas are most com­
monly used on satellites, as they lend themselves to accommodation within a com­
pact volume. They provide some advantages in terms of flexibility and RF per­
formance. A Ku-band dual polarized transmit and receive steerable elliptic beam 
generated by shaped dual offset reflector antenna was first described by Viskum 
et al. in 1992 [26]. The coverage consisted of two concentric ellipses (1.6° × 3.0° 
and 2.2° × 4.6°), and an elliptical aperture was used to meet edge of coverage gain 
and low side lobe requirements. The worst-case cross polar discrimination over the 
coverage was 35 dB. 
A natural evolution to the steerable elliptical spot beams was to increase their 
coverage flexibility by incorporating beam rotation over the angular range ±90°. 
Toward this goal, Peleca has presented the performance of steerable and rotatable 
dual reflector design [27]. Both main and subreflectors have circular apertures and 
have been shaped using TICRA software. By rotating the subreflector around its 
axis, major axis of the pattern rotation around the beam bore-sight is achieved. 
Good agreement between predicted and measured gain and cross polarization per­
formance was reported for four subreflector rotation angles (0°, 65°, 90°, and 
155°). 
Mizzoni and Jorgensen [28] have further extended the steerable and rotatable 
design to include zooming effect with the help of translating of main reflector along 
offset axis. The dual reflector antenna is designed to realize a rotatable small el­
liptical beam of 1.6° × 3.9°, an enlarged (zoomed) rotatable beam of 1.9° × 4.3°, 
and circular beam of 2° diameter. The antenna configuration with the axes along 
which the subreflector is rotated and the main reflector is translated is shown in 
Figure 7.22. The design optimization is carried out in the following steps: (1) main 
and subreflectors shaping for the small ellipse coverage, (2) optimization of main 
reflector positions for enlarged ellipse and circular beams, and (3) reshaping of re­
flector surfaces for optimum performance of three beams. Jorgensen and Mizzoni 
have summarized a detailed study of beam reconfiguration capabilities of dual off­
set Gregorian antennas [29]. The optimized beams [29] are shown in Figure 7.23.
Under the framework of flexible innovative payload (FLIP) supported by 
CNES, Thales has developed a solution with switchable subreflectors to provide 
coverage flexibility [30]. This design consists of a fixed main reflector illuminated 
by one of several subreflectors where each of these subreflectors has a different 
shaped surface to provide a different shaped beam. The selection of the relevant 
subreflector or subreflectarray is done with the help of a positioning mechanism 
that is actuated to place the desired surface for illumination by the feed, as shown 
in Figure 7.24. A detailed RF performance evaluation of this antenna system was 
presented in [30].

Deployable antennas of satellites, which are much larger than deck-mounted 
antennas, have steering capabilities, either limited to few degrees around the bore 
sight or all over the visible Earth depending on their field of view with spacecraft 
structure. New deployment mechanisms for reflectors typically have the ability to 
finely adjust the deployment angle to apply a bias to the reflector so that the beam 
can be pointed away from the nominal direction. It is also possible to optimize a re­
flector antenna system for multiple orbital locations taking into account the point­
ing capabilities of deployed reflectors. Recently, a Ku-band dual reflector design 
to support an intercontinental coverage by a GEO satellite, which can be located 
between 10°E and 70°E longitudes, was investigated by Cappellin et al [31]. A 
mechanically reconfigurable subreflector with a mesh of interwoven flexible wires 
with a fixed main reflector was implemented in this work.

Axially symmetric Cassegrain and Gregorian reflector antennas have been used 
extensively in Earth station, radio astronomy, and satellite systems. The main disad­
vantage of these axially symmetric dual offset reflectors is that the subreflector in­
tercepts part of the main beam and thus causes undesired performance degradation 
like high side lobes, cross polarization, and poor return loss. This is particularly 
true for the cases of small electrical dimensions of the antenna where diffraction 
effects prevent realization of high efficiencies. The efficiency of an electrically small 
(diameter ~ 26λ) Cassegrain antenna was increased by shaping the reflectors using 
ray optics [32]. This technique resulted in an overall efficiency varying from 60–65 
percent over a 1.16:1 frequency band. Alternate options to improve performance of 
small reflectors are the use of either backfire feed in conventional paraboloid or axi­
ally displaced dual reflector antennas that avoid the main reflector scattered energy 
toward the subreflector [33–37]. Moreira and Prata Jr. [37] have described a gen­
eralized study of axially symmetric dual-reflector antennas by classifying them into 
four distinct configurations: axially displaced Cassegrain (ADC), axially displaced 
hyperbola (ADH), axially displaced Gregorian (ADG), and axially displaced ellipse 
(ADE). Simple closed-form design equations and the aperture distribution were 
derived. A parametric study was conducted to determine configurations providing 
maximum radiation efficiency. 
The axially displaced ellipse reflector antenna has received lot of attention in 
recent years [34, 38, 39, 42] for use in small-size satellite on the move (SOTM) ter­
minals operating single or multiple frequencies. It has also been used in spacecraft 
communications systems [40, 41]. The main advantages of ADE configuration are 
relatively high aperture efficiencies for small main reflector diameters, subreflectors 
several times smaller than those used in Cassegrain antennas resulting low subre­
flector blockage loss, and low reflections in the feeds. 
The ADE reflector antenna geometry is depicted in Figure 7.25. The main re­
flector is a parabola whose axis is displaced from the antenna axis of symmetry. 
The subreflector is an ellipse with one of the foci coinciding with that of the main

parabolic reflector creating a ring focus, with its other focus located on the an­
tenna axis of symmetry where the feed horn is placed. Figure 7.26 shows the ray 
plot of the ADE reflector configuration. As seen from this plot, the inner-most ray 
of the feed horn is redirected by the elliptical subreflector to the outer edge of the 
parabolic main reflector, while the ray from the feed horn to the outer edge of the 
subreflector is redirected to the most inward radius of the main reflector that is not 
blocked by the subreflector. In other words, ADE reflector design possesses ray-
inversion characteristic with the inner rays of the horn illuminating the outer part

of the main reflector and vice versa. The geometric optics rays are reflected neither 
back into the prime feed from the subreflector nor back into the subreflector from 
the main reflector. The blockage due to the feed and subreflector is greatly reduced 
by the creation of a nonilluminated region in the center of the main aperture.
The ADE geometry, shown in Figure 7.25, can be described using the geometri­
cal parameters of the main and subreflectors:
••
Dm: Diameter of the main parabolic reflector;
••
F: Focal length of the main reflector;
••
Ds: Diameter of the subreflector (same as parabola displacement from an­
tenna axis);
••
Θe: Feed half-subtended angle with subreflector;
••
e: Eccentricity of the subreflector;
••
c: Half of inter-focal distance;
••
β: Tilt angle of the ellipse axis with the antenna axis of symmetry;
••
ψo: Half-subtended angle of the main reflector.

where ρ is the subreflector polar coordinate from prime focus, y is the perpendicu­
lar distance of main reflector from antenna axis of symmetry, and φ is the angle of 
geometric ray originating from prime focus and measured from antenna axis.
An example design of an ADE reflector antenna was carried out at 14 GHz. 
The main reflector is 25 inches in diameter and the subreflector diameter is 3.7 in. 
The feed subtended angle at the subreflector is ±40°. A Gaussian feed with -12 dB 
taper is assumed. The performance of the ADE antenna has been evaluated using 
GRASP software from TICRA. Physical optics based analysis is used in the simu­
lation. The contributions of diffracted field from the subreflector and direct feed

radiation are added to the far-field pattern of the main reflector. The simulated ra­
diation pattern is shown in Figure 7.27. The predicted directivity is 37.8 dBi, which 
corresponds to an aperture efficiency of 70 percent.
In practical applications, the subreflector is supported by struts or feedome. To 
account for the interaction between the feed and the subreflector and the effect of 
subreflector support structure, body of revolution and method of moments (BoR-
MoM)–based software tools are recommended. A simultaneous optimization of 
the feed horn geometry and shaping rotationally symmetric reflectors is expected 
to produce ADE designs with higher efficiencies.
A brief summary of ADE reflector antenna hardware reported in literature is 
presented next. Compact dual and triple frequency ADE reflector antennas have 
been designed for EHF satellite communication terminals. Rotman and Lee [34] 
have presented the performance of 6-in and 12-in ADE reflector antennas with 
a dual frequency feed design for 21 GHz and 44 GHz. The measured aperture 
efficiencies were 43 percent (low frequency) and 62 percent (high frequency) for 
6-in antennas, and 52 percent and 63 percent for 12-in antennas. An ADE design 
adopted for 24-in antennas [42] provided measured efficiencies of 55 percent and 
66 percent at low and high frequencies. Targonski has reported the design and 
characteristics of a 16-in triple band ADE reflector antenna. The measured efficien­
cies were 59 percent, 64 percent, and 68 percent for K-, Ka-, and Q-bands, respec­
tively. A multiband (C-/Ku-) ADE reflector of 108-in size was developed by Harris 
Corp [39]. Its aperture efficiency was about 55 percent at 4.0 GHz, 63 percent at 
6.25 GHz, 69 percent at 11 GHz, and 73 percent at 14.3 GHz. An X-band ADE 
demonstration model of 1.25m diameter was designed, and its measured efficiency 
was 70 percent, without the effects of struts [40]. Another X-band ADE design was 
reported to have an aperture efficiency of 55 percent for a 0.7m antenna [41]. The 
multiband ADE efficiencies can be significantly improved by using low-loss feed 
assemblies using integrated designs, as described in Chapter 7 of Volume 3 of this 
book.

8.1  Introduction
Reflectarray antennas are hybrid of two different antenna technologies, namely, 
phased array and conventional reflector [1–3]. Typical reflectarray is composed of 
a number of radiators that impart a specified amount of phase to the incident field 
from a feed or multiplicity of feeds and subsequently reradiates the signal into the 
free space. Its similarity to phased array stems from the fact that it is composed of 
a set of radiating elements, and it is different from a phased array because it uti­
lizes the free-space as a medium for combining the outgoing signal. On the other 
hand, it is similar to a conventional reflector in the sense that it exploits a feed to 
illuminate a reflecting surface, whereas the reflection does not obey geometrical or 
physical optics rules as is the case in the conventional reflector. It is the aggregate 
response of the whole multiplicity of elements that provides a given phase front 
transformation. In its simplest form, typical reflectarray imitates the function of a 
center-fed parabolic reflector, and its surface transforms spherical phase front of 
the incident field from the feed into planar phase front that results in collimated 
beam. The reflectarray utilizes free-space as the medium to distribute and combine 
the signal to and from the radiating elements, which reduces transmission losses as 
compared to phased-array antennas. On the other hand, using a whole set of radiat­
ing elements to carry out the phase transformation endows the reflectarray with a 
number of flexibilities as compared to conventional reflector [1–3]. One disadvan­
tage of reflectarray as compared to conventional is its limited bandwidth caused by 
the limited bandwidth of the elements and frequency dispersion [2, 4]. Although 
this shortcoming does not pose a serious handicap in the design and operation of 
medium gain reflectarrays (< 35 dB) at Ku- and Ka-band with 5 to 10 percent rela­
tive bandwidth requirement, it can seriously restrict its application in lower band 
applications such as C-band because of the wide relative bandwidth requirement in 
this particular band. A number of methods have been developed in the literature in 
order to address both of these issues [5, 6].

Reflectarray Antennas
The earliest realization of reflectarray, shown in Figure 8.1, dates back to early 
1960s when a 426 array of [7] waveguides fed by horn were used to collimate the 
feed illumination. The lengths of shorted waveguides were adjusted in order to 
realize the desired phase front transformation. The upward shift of the operating 
frequency band of different communication schemes along with the bulky nature 
of this antenna and complexity of its fabrication obstructed further development of 
waveguide-based reflecatarray. The advent of microstrip patch as a viable radiating 
element gave an impetus to reflectarray research and development [8]. A typical 
reflectarray composed of printed rings as the cell element is shown in Figure 8.2. 
The fact that the reflectarray is composed of printed elements renders it many 
flexibilities such as the possibility of having multiple feeds dedicated to a given 
polarization and/or frequency band. This, as will be seen later, leads to significant 
simplification of the feed system [9]. On the other hand, the use of lithographic 
technology as the method of fabrication paves the way for integration of active 
Figure 8.1  View of the waveguide reflectarray. (© IEEE 1963. Reprinted with permission from [7].)

elements into the reflectarray elements, which brings about a myriad of possibili­
ties in terms of beam switching [10], adaptive beam shaping [11], and distributed 
power amplification [12]. 
The objective of this chapter is to present a general overview of design meth­
odology and state-of-the-art developments in reflectarray technology. The next sec­
tion of this chapter is devoted to general design guidelines for reflectarrays and 
mathematical relationships that are used to determine the aperture phase distri­
bution. Comparison of reflectarray and conventional reflector aperture efficiency 
figures will be presented in the subsequent section. This should provide the reader 
with an objective comparison between the two technologies from different perspec­
tives. Section 8.4 is devoted to the study of the contribution of different reflectar­
ray constituent elements, namely, cell elements, dielectric substrate, and ground 
plane, to the total radiation pattern of the antenna. The understanding of these 
contributions is of significant importance for an in-depth insight into the opera­
tion reflectarray. This insight proves to be particularly useful in the study of such 
topics as beam squint [13] and focal shift movement in reflectarray antennas [14]. 
Microstrip patch has been utilized as the cell element in printed reflectarrays from 
the early days of this technology [15]. This particular cell element will be used as 
an example in Section 8.5 to present general tradeoffs and trends that govern the 
phase response of a typical cell element of a reflectarray. A brief presentation of the 
types of cell elements will be given in the same section. Reflectarray have been used 
in many different applications and different contexts. A number of these applica­
tions will be presented in Section 8.6. This presentation is by no means exhaustive 
in the coverage of the vast previous and evolving literature on reflectarray, and the 
interested reader is referred to relevant journals and publications on this subject. 
8.2  General Design Guidelines
As pointed out in the introduction, reflectarray technology is a hybrid of phased ar­
ray and conventional reflector technologies. Similar to phased array, it is comprised 
of a set of elements that are placed in a regular lattice configuration on a generally 
flat surface. It draws its similarity with the conventional reflector from the fact that 
both structures are fed by a feed through free space. It is different from phased ar­
ray in the sense that its elements are quasi-periodic. In other words, dimensions of 
its elements are not similar. On the other hand, implementation of a phase front 
transformation mechanism through adjustment of the size and shape of its elements 
differentiates a reflectarray from conventional reflector that exploits the laws of 
Euclidean geometry and direct reflection of incoming rays to achieve the same. A 
reflectarray, in its most basic form, is comprised of a group of quasi-periodic cell 
elements that are etched on a grounded substrate, as shown in Figure 8.3. The PEC 
backing of the substrate causes all the incoming energy to be reflected back into the 
upper half space. 
Patch dimensions are adjusted to realize an equi-phase aperture field distribu­
tion, which is tantamount to broadside radiation from the reflectarray. To achieve 
this objective, the patch element located at A (see Figure 8.3) of the reflectarray 
ought to impart the following phase to the incoming ray of the spherical phase 
front that originates from the focal point:

where n is an integer, k0 is the free space wavenumber, and fA is the scattered phase 
generated by the patch located at point A. Fulfillment of (8.1) forces a phase differ­
ence of 2np between any given patch on the reflectarray and the patch located at 
O, which is the center of reflectarray. The phase generated by the patch is limited 
between 0° and 360°.
The same procedure can be followed to obtain the required phase contribution 
of each given patch to realize a scanned beam reflectarray shown in Figure 8.4. 
The direction of the outgoing beam is represented as ˆout
r . The following relation­
ship gives the amount of phase to be imparted by the patch located at point A of 
reflectarray in order to maintain the scanned beam:

Scanned beam reflectors have been realized in the context of offset-fed reflec­
tors in order to avoid feed blockage [16]. However, the offset-fed reflector is at a 
disadvantage from a mechanical point of view as compared to a center-fed para­
bolic reflector. Figure 8.4 demonstrates the possibility of the design of a center-fed 
reflectarray with scanned beam, as the direction of the outgoing beam can be ad­
justed by implementing the appropriate phase transformation as reported in [17]. 
The structure is mechanically sound, while the blockage has been avoided because 
of the scanned beam. This is one of the many flexibilities that is offered by reflec­
tarray technology. 
The presence of the frequency dependent factor, k0, in (8.1) and (8.2) imposes 
a restriction on the bandwidth of the reflectarray. To further elucidate this point, 
it is to be noted that the desired phase obtained from these equations is dependent 
on the frequency. Once the cell element dimensions have been chosen to realize the 
desired phase, the same cell element might not achieve the required phase value 
for a different frequency. This leads to loss of gain of the reflectarray antenna for 
frequencies other than its design frequency as a result of growing phase error on the 
radiating aperture of the antenna. The phase error that is caused by the frequency

dependence of (8.1) and (8.2) is known as spatial phase dispersion, and its impact 
becomes more apparent on performance of large reflectarrays or when F/D is be­
low 0.5 [4]. Techniques have been developed to broaden the operating bandwidth 
of reflectarray [3]. To give a brief overview of the broadbanding technique, the 
shape of the cell element should be optimized to satisfy prescribed phase response 
at more than one frequency apart from the mid-band frequency [5, 6]. 
Nothing has been said up to this point on the methods to actually realize the 
desired phase values that are calculated using (8.1) and (8.2). A brief diversion 
into infinite periodic structures is helpful to present the phase shift mechanism in 
a reflectarray. Figure 8.5 shows an infinite periodic structure that is composed of 
microstrip patches etched on a grounded dielectric substrate of permittivity er and 
thickness h. The patches are set into a regular lattice of the size Tx and Ty along 
x- and y-axis, respectively. The structure is illuminated by a normal incident plane 
wave. The lattice dimensions have been selected to be smaller than l0/2 in order to 
avoid excitation of grating lobes [18]. The presence of the ground plane in the back 
of the substrate constrains the amplitude of the reflected wave to unity. However, 
the phase of the reflected wave depends on the structural parameters of the periodic 
structure. A typical plot of the phase of the reflected wave versus the length of the 
patch is presented in Figure 8.5. Generally, the desired phase that is to be imparted 
by the cell element changes gradually on the surface of the reflectarray. Therefore, 
each locality of the reflectarray can be assumed to be an infinite periodic structure 
that is illuminated by a plane wave whose angle of incidence and polarization is 
dictated by the relative location of the feed and the given locality. Then, the infinite 
periodic structure approximation is utilized to calculate the phase imparted by the 
patch at that particular locality [19]. Having plotted the phase of the reflected wave 
versus the size of the length of the patch, the length can be adjusted to obtain the re­
quired phase on a given lattice point on the reflectarray. It is noteworthy that local 
periodicity (LP) assumption has an important role in applying the infinite periodic 
structure analysis to the design of reflectarrays. The LP assumption breaks down 
when the feed is very close to the reflectarray surface or in the regions of sharp 
phase variation. Special types of cell elements can be devised to maximize similar­
ity between adjacent cell elements of a reflectarray [20, 21]. Various methods have

been presented in the literature for the analysis of infinite periodic structures [18, 
22]. The same 2D infinite periodic structure assumption can be used for other types 
of cell elements. Figure 8.6 shows a number of conventional cell elements that have 
been used in reflectarray structures and the geometrical features that are to be ad­
justed in order to realize the required phase shift.

8.3  Aperture Efficiency of Reflectarray and Comparison with 
Conventional Parabolic Reflector
In order to assess the performance of reflectarrays in the context of reflectors, ef­
ficiency terms that are used for the latter are applied to the evaluation of the former. 
Among these efficiency terms are feed illumination taper, feed illumination spillover, 
aperture phase error, cross-polarization effects, feed blockage, conductor loss, and 
feed mismatch. Since the substrate is an inherent component of any printed reflec­
tarray, an additional efficiency term must be defined to assess the effect of dielectric 
loss on the performance of the reflectarray. Definitions of these terms are presented 
in [23] and applied in this section to give a mathematical expression for each of 
the efficiency factors and provide a qualitative comparison of the performance of 
reflectarray with conventional parabolic reflector in terms of each of these factors. 
8.3.1  Illumination Efficiency
Illumination efficiency is a measure of the uniformity of the feed illumination of 
the reflectarray. It is well known that as the illumination tapers toward the rim 
of the reflectarray or reflector, the side lobe level tends to decrease and the main 
beam broadens. The mathematical expression for illumination efficiency is given 
as follows:

(8.3)
where it is assumed in (8.3) that the desired aperture field is y-polarized and the 
aperture is of circular shape with radius a. In the case of conventional reflector, the 
feed illumination taper is solely determined by the feed pattern, but in the case of 
reflectarray, the illumination also depends on the radiation pattern of the constitu­
ent elements of the reflectarrary. As depicted in Figure 8.7, the broadside radiation 
pattern of the cell element necessarily leads to reduction of intercepted power by 
the element when it is illuminated by rays from the feed that are away from the 
Figure 8.6  Conventional cell elements that have been used in reflectarray antennas.

254

broadside direction of that given element. Therefore, the illumination taper of the 
feed is further accentuated by the element pattern. The element pattern makes an 
impact for F/D < 0.5 when the illumination angle of feed for the edge elements of 
the reflectarray is increased. The relatively larger taper that is attributable to ele­
ment pattern entails marginally lower illumination efficiency in the case of reflectar­
ray and also lower side lobe level.
8.3.2  Spillover Efficiency

reflectarray and is calculated using the following expression:

where y is the subtended angle of reflectarray or reflector aperture defined in Fig­
ure 8.8 and g(q, f) is the feed radiation pattern. It can be seen that for the same D 
and F/D ratio, the subtended angle of the parabolic reflector is slightly larger than 
that of the reflectarray. The difference between the subtended angles of parabolic 
reflector and its equivalent reflectarray increases as F/D shrinks and puts parabolic 
reflector at an advantage in terms of spillover efficiency as compared to its reflectar­
ray equivalent. 
Assuming that the feed pattern is of cosn(q) form, one can derive the following

The illumination efficiency is the product of spillover and taper efficiencies. 
The reflectarray illumination efficiency is plotted in Figure 8.9 for different values 
of n for the feed pattern of cosn(q). As it is the case for conventional reflectors, it 
can be seen for a given feed pattern, there is an optimum subtended angle for which 
the illumination efficiency is maximized. This optimum subtended angle can be 
translated into an optimum F/D ratio.

where Ex and Ey are transverse components of the aperture electric field and the 
extent of integration is restricted to reflectarray radiation aperture. The integra­
tion is to be performed few wavelengths away from the reflectarray to ensure that 
higher order modes of the periodic structure have died down [18]. Expression (8.7) 
is a measure of the power that is coupled into the cross-polarization component of 
the antenna radiation. Normally, a feed with poor cross-polarization performance 
leads to low hx in the case of center-fed parabolic reflector because its surface is 
indifferent to the sense of linear polarization and it collimates both co- and cross-
polarization components. On the other hand, the cell elements of a reflectarray can 
be selected on the basis of low cross-polarization radiation (such as printed dipole), 
which leads to scattering of the cross-polarization component of the feed radiation. 
Hence, one can expect superior cross-polarization performance with a feed of mod­
erate cross-polarization performance in the case of center-fed broadside reflectarray 
with polarization selective cell elements as compared to its conventional reflector 
counterpart. The same statement holds for the case of offset-fed reflectors, which 
are plagued by relatively high cross-polarization for observation angles off the main 
beam. The equivalent offset-fed reflectarray can attain better cross-polarization as 
compared to its equivalent conventional reflector, as a result of the polarization 
selectivity of its constituent cell elements. 
8.3.4  Phase Efficiency
Deviation from uniform phase on the radiating aperture of the antenna leads to 
degradation in antenna gain. The measure of phase uniformity is defined as follows:

where Ey represents co-polarized E-field on the radiating aperture of the reflectar­
ray. Again, the integration is to be carried out several wavelengths away from the 
surface of reflectarray. The uniformity of the aperture field distribution of a reflec­
tarray can be disrupted by three factors. The first stems from using infinite periodic 
structure assumption at the design stage of the reflectarray. It should be noted that 
gradual variation of the geometrical features of the constituent cell elements of

reflectarray throughout its aperture is a deviation from infinite periodic structure 
assumption at the design stage. Therefore, the actual phase that is realized on the 
reflectarray can be different from the desired phase. Departure from desired phase 
values is more intense in the transition regions on the reflectarray where there is a 
phase jump from 0 to 2p, which is manifest in abrupt change of element dimensions 
in such regions. Noting that the phase transformation is carried out in a quantized 
fashion, a quantization error might occur for lattice size in excess of l/2. However, 
the quantization error is less than 0.1 dB if the lattice size is in the order half wave­
length and reduces rapidly as the lattice size shrinks. Therefore, one can see the 
importance of maintaining small lattice size in achieving uniform phase because 
the quantization is reduced significantly, and the assumption of infinite periodic 
structure also becomes more relevant. The second source of nonuniform phase is 
fabrication error [19]. The etching technology that is used for the fabrication of the 
reflectarray should be capable of exact realization of design dimensions. Any error 
in fabrication leads to deviation from desired phase. Surface roughness in the case 
of conventional solid reflectors acts similarly in degrading phase efficiency [25]. It is 
usually difficult to maintain roughness tolerance for large reflectors that operate in 
Ka- and higher frequency bands, whereas the required fabrication tolerance for re­
flectarrays in such bands is well within the realm of conventional lithographic tech­
niques. The last factor that can adversely impact the phase uniformity of aperture 
field distribution is deviation of the radiated phase front of the feed from spherical 
phase front and movement of the feed phase center throughout the operating band 
of the reflectarray [26, 27]. This issue can be addressed by either careful selection of 
the feed or dispersion engineering on the cell element reflected phase to compensate 
for the movement of the phase center of the feed.
8.3.5  Blockage Efficiency
The feed assembly blocks the aperture radiation and hence degrades the perfor­
mance by reducing the gain and also increasing the cross-polarization. Calculation 
of the following expression gives a measure of the adverse effect of blockage on the 
antenna performance:

where b is the radius of the feed region. Feed blockage is inevitable in the case 
of center-fed parabolic reflectors. The larger the feed assembly, the lower is the 
blockage efficiency. However, a center-fed reflectarray can be designed to avoid the 
blockage completely by setting the direction of the outgoing beam appropriately 
[17]. Implementing this measure, higher blockage efficiency is quite practical in the 
case of center-fed reflectarrays. Additionally, feed return loss can be significantly 
improved in the case of center-fed reflectarray by setting the outgoing beam at an 
off-boresight direction to avoid the feed assembly region.

8.3.6  Dielectric and Conductor Loss
Conductor loss and substrate loss are among the other factors that can reduce the 
efficiency of the reflectarray [19]. These two loss factors lead to less than unity re­
flection coefficient for the reflectarray. Methods such as resorting to subwavelength 
cell elements have been used to mitigate the loss reduction for reflectarray struc­
tures etched on lossy substrate [28]. This particular loss factor can be quantified 
using the following expression:

where Gn is reflection from the nth cell element subject to local periodicity assump­
tion, and summation has been carried out over the total N cells of the reflectarray. 
Some of these efficiency figures were estimated in [19] for a typical reflectar­
ray structure. Dielectric and conductor losses were underlined in the case discussed 
for two 6-in reflectarrays that were designed to operate at 28.0 GHz. One of the 
reflectarrays was etched on 0.020-in Duroid material with er = 2.2 of loss tangent 
0.0028 and the other etched on 0.010-in Taconic TLE substrate of er = 2.95 and 
loss tangent 0.0074. Both reflectarrays were center-fed with the same feed, and the 
subtended angle was set to 72°. This translated to -7 dB edge taper at the rim of 
the reflectrray. The reflectarrays were designed to scan the main beam to 25° to 
mitigate the feed blockage. Figure 8.10 shows a view of the reflectarray. Calculated 
efficiency figures for these two reflectarrays are tabulated in Table 8.1.
In summary, using figures of merit that are used in the case of conventional 
reflector to assess its performance and efficiency leads to meaningful measures in 
the case of reflectarray. However, one should be attentive of the differences of re­
flectarrays and reflectors when using these criteria to assess the performance of the 
former.

8.4  Contribution of Scattering from Constituent Components of a 
Reflectarray to Its Near-Field and Far-Field Operation
A printed reflectarray is comprised of printed cell elements, ground-plane, and di­
electric substrate. The performance of the reflectarray in terms of field distributions 
in near- and far-zones can be understood in terms of the sum of scattered fields 
from these constituent components. Electrical currents on the conducting parts 
(ground-pane and cell elements) and polarization current that is attributed to the 
field within the dielectric substrate can be used to estimate the scattered field from 
each respective component [29]. Different methods have been introduced in the lit­
erature to derive far-field radiation pattern of reflectarrays. For instance, a method 
that is akin to array theory has been introduced in [1] and a more accurate method 
based on free space Green’s functions has been proposed in [30]. However, the is­
sue of contribution of the each of the constituent components of the reflectarray 
is not addressed in these publications. Post-processing of results from commercial 
full-wave software ANSYS-HFSS [31] simulations is used in this section to obtain 
the contribution of dielectric substrate, ground plane, and cell elements separately. 
Full-wave computational electromagnetic packages such as HFSS [31] have 
been widely used to analyze scattering from objects. However, these commercial 
packages provide the user with total scattering from the object, and investigation 
of the contribution of the subregions of the scatterer to the scattered field is not 
straightforward. Rigorous calculations should be carried out to find the current 
distribution on each constituent component of the reflectarray in order to calculate 
the contribution of that particular component to the total radiated field. The reflec­
tarray can be accounted as a scatterer that is illuminated by a radiated field from 
the feed as shown in Figure 8.11. 
It is assumed throughout this section that the cell element of the reflectarray is 
microstrip patch. In a reflectarray model such as that depicted in Figure 8.11, HFSS 
calculates the fields over a highly dense mesh within the radiation box that encloses 
the entire reflectarray structure. But it does not give direct access to both the ampli­
tude and phase of current densities over a user-specified grid of points on selected

parts of the reflectarray. The structure is illuminated by importing the field distribu­
tion of a horn that is located at the focal point of the reflectarray. The electric cur­
rent on the conductors (cell elements and ground plane) is equal to the discontinuity 
of tangential magnetic fields on these regions. Therefore, a dense grid is defined on 
the plane where the conductors are located (z = 0 for patch elements and z = -h for 
the ground plane) and size of the grid cell Dx by Dy is set be much smaller than the 
lattice size of the reflectarray, namely, dx by dy. Using the software calculated values 
of magnetic field on the user-defined grid at the cell element level (z = 0), the electric 
current distribution,

 are unit normal to the conductor and magnetic fields in the 
substrate and air regions, respectively. The vectors have been depicted in Figure

plane. The field vectors are calculated on the immediate vicinity above and below 
the user-defined grid. Applying (8.11) to the points that lie on the conducting re­
gions gives rise to electric current distribution in these areas, whereas its application 
to the air substrate regions lead to very negligible values for

ity on electric conductors. Since

or ground plane. A limiting operation was performed for Dz from 10-3m to 10-7m 
to obtain the electric current distribution, and it was found that convergence occurs 
at Dz = 10-6m. Free space Green’s function can be used to find the radiated field 
from the expression given in (8.12).
To investigate the contributions of the reflectarray components to its far-field 
pattern, a single layer center-fed reflectarray of rectangular patches was designed 
and simulated at a center frequency of 30 GHz (λ0 = 10.0 mm). The substrate has 
εr = 3.0  and thickness h = 0.508 mm. The reflectarray size is 15.5λ0 × 15.5λ0  and 
the feed phase center located at F = 15.5 λ0  from its surface. A subdivision size of 
∆x = ∆y = λ0/20 was used whereas dx = dy = λ0/2.
Knowing the field distribution on the radiating aperture and ground plane of 
the reflectarray, current distributions on patches and ground plane have been cal­
culated from (8.12), and the results are shown in Figure 8.13. The symmetry of the 
reflectarray has been exploited to restrict the computational domain to a quarter 
of reflectarray. Regions of the ground plane that are underneath resonant or near-
resonant patches support strong current almost equal to the amplitude of the cur­
rent on these same patches. This observation tends to establish similarity between 
these patches and open resonators with upper patch and the underneath ground 
plane regions as their top and bottom conducting surfaces. It is to be noted that the 
regions of the ground plane that are highly exposed to the radiated field from the 
feed do not support strong current.

The radiated field from the ground plane and patches can be calculated using 
free space Green’s function, and the results are shown in Figure 8.14. It can be 
observed that the ground plane and the patches almost equally contribute to the 
radiated field. This is expected from the knowledge of almost similar order cur­
rent distribution on the ground plane and patches, as observed in Figure 8.13. The 
separate radiation pattern of the ground plane and the patches are almost similar 
to each other with high sidelobe levels. However, the high sidelobes of the indi­
vidual radiation patterns have disappeared when a complex addition is performed 
to obtain the combined radiation pattern. Mitigation of the high sidelobe can be 
understood from Figure 8.15, which shows the phase distribution of the radiated 
fields from the ground plane and patches. In this figure the phase of the pattern due 
to the groundplane currents has purposefully had 180° added to it, and thus where 
the two curves are almost coincident (namely, beyond 7°), there will be destruc­
tive interference, and where they are not coincident (the main beam region), some

constructive interference is possible. Figure 8.16 shows a comparison of the com-
plex addition of the radiation patterns of ground plane and patch elements with 
the total HFSS [31] calculated radiation pattern of the reflectarray. The discrepancy 
between the two radiation patterns represents the contribution of substrate polar-
ization current to the total radiation. Although the substrate’s contributions may 
seem minor, its presence of course impacts the actual conduction current distribu-
tions due to the interactions between the components of the reflectarray that are 
included in the HFSS [31] model.
8.5 Different Types of Reﬂ ectarray Cell Elements 
Printed reflectarray is comprised of a quasi-periodic arrangement of printed ele-
ments that operate in an array environment in order to attain a given phase trans-
formation. Therefore, developments in printed periodic structures such as frequency 
selective surfaces (FSS) and printed antenna elements have triggered new advance-
ments in the field of reflectarray technology. As will be seen in this section, a large 
class of the cell elements that has been utilized in reflectarray antennas is inspired 
by earlier research on these same elements in the context of periodic structures and/
or single radiator elements.
Microstrip patch is the most common and widely used printed antenna [32]. 
Therefore, it is the first type of printed cell element that was utilized in the early 
stages of printed reflectarray antennas [33, 34]. Using the local periodic assumption 
that was presented in Section 8.2, the reflectarray can be locally modeled as infinite 
2D periodic structure composed of patches etched on a dielectric slab with ground-
plane backing. Therefore, the reflectarray is locally similar to an FSS structure 
that is backed by ground plane. It is well-known that an FSS composed of patch 
elements is reflective at resonance [35], which leads a series resonant equivalent 
circuit for such structures. The presence of the ground plane can be approximated 
to the first order as an inductive loading that shifts down the resonant frequency 
of the FSS and imposes unity of reflection amplitude prior to the emergence of the 
first grating lobe. Figure 8.17 shows the equivalent circuit of a given region of the 
reflectarray subject to the local periodicity assumption. 
General trends that govern behavior of the patch element as the reflectarray 
cell element can be understood by resorting to the previous equivalent circuit and 
prior knowledge on the performance of an FSS composed of rectangular patches 
Figure 8.17 Equivalent circuit of 2-D lattice patches on ground plane and supported by a dielectric 
substrate of height h and permittivity er.

8.4  Different Types of Reflectarray Cell Elements

[35]. This includes the effect of substrate thickness, substrate permittivity, and loss 
tangent of the substrate on the performance phase-length characteristic of the cell 
element. These trends are generally valid for other types of cell elements.
A typical phase-versus-length plot of a 2D periodic structure composed of 
patches etched on a dielectric substrate with ground plane backing is presented 
in Figure 8.18. It is to be noted that the bandwidth of the element depends on the 
slope of phase-length characteristic of the element, which can be seen from the na­
ture of the Figure 8.17 equivalent circuit. 
Increasing the substrate permittivity generally leads to lower resonant frequen­
cy for an FSS structure [35]. This general trend, when applied to the case of a 
reflectarray cell element, translates into the shift of the phase-length characteristics 
toward shorter patches for the given phase variation, as shown in Figure 8.19 
[3]. On the other hand, from the point of view the cell element as a microstrip 
patch, it is understood that the lower permittivity of the substrate leads to a wider

Figure 8.5 for notations): Tx = Ty = 20.0 mm, L = W = 10.0 mm, er = 3.0, h = 2.0 mm.

Reflectarray Antennas
bandwidth and lower Q of the patch [24, 32]. Therefore, it is expected that the 
lower substrate permittivity gives rise to a more gradual phase-length curve, as seen 
in Figure 8.19. Generally, width of the phase transition region represents the width 
of the resonance. Therefore, more gradual slope represents a wider transition and 
a wider element bandwidth.
The effect of the substrate height on the phase-length characteristic of the patch 
cell element is shown in Figure 8.20, which demonstrates reduction of the realiz­
able phase range as the substrate height is increased. The reduced achievable phase 
range leads to phase error on the reflectarray because the whole 360° phase range 
is required to realize the correct phase transformation. Therefore, reduced phase 
range leads to lower phase efficiency.
Inherent dielectric loss of substrate is another factor that degrades the effi­
ciency of reflectarray [36]. The amplitude of current distribution on the patch is 
highest when it is at resonance, which leads to strong field values within the lossy 
substrate. Therefore, the impact of substrate loss tangent is higher for resonant 
length of the patch. This is also evident from inspection of Figure 8.21 where the 
maximum loss corresponds to the resonant length of the patch. It is to be noted 
that DL in Figure 8.21 represents deviation from resonant length [19]. Resonant 
length is defined to be the length of the patch that corresponds to the mid-point 
of the phase-length characteristic between the two extremes of achievable phase 
values. Recently, techniques have been developed to mitigate the adverse effect of 
lossy substrate on the efficiency of reflectarray structures [28]. 
To explore the effect of patch width on the phase-length characteristics, revisit­
ing the behavior of FSS-composed rectangular patches would be useful. It is dem­
onstrated that for FSS comprised of patches, reducing the patch width reduces FSS 
bandwidth and also its resonant frequency [35]. This trend in the case of FSS trans­
lates into steeper phase-length characteristics and longer resonant length when a

narrower microstrip patch is used, as the cell element of reflectarray as observed 
in Figure 8.22.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, analysis of the reflectarray is based on local 
periodicity assumption. In other words, each region of the reflectarray is assumed 
to be an infinite periodic structure that is illuminated by a plane wave traveling 
along the line that connects the feed to the center of that same region with the 
same polarization as the feed. For a center-fed reflectarray, it is evident that as the 
subtended angle increases (smaller F/D ratio), the incident angle of the plane wave 
for the peripheral regions of reflectarray deviates further from normal incidence. 
Therefore, it is important to account for the angular sensitivity of the phase re­
sponse of the cell element of reflectarray with small F/D ratio (typically F/D<0.5). 
Angular sensitivity of a typical patch cell element is shown in Figure 8.23, which

shows a noticeable deviation from normal incidence as the angle of incidence ex­
ceeds q0 = 20°. This deviation is more significant in the case of TM polarization.
Rectangular patch is not the only resonant type printed cell elements that can 
be used as the cell element of a reflectarray. Other types of resonant printed struc­
tures can be considered as potential alternatives for the cell element of the reflec­
tarray, and resonant dimensions of each given type of element can be adjusted in 
order to attaint the required reflection phase shift. Among these cell elements are 
gangbuster element [37], stacked patch [38], and loop [39, 40], as shown in Figure 
8.24. Generally, the fundamental resonant mode of the cell elements is used in the 
design of reflectarray, and higher order resonant modes have rarely been explored 
as an option for the operating mode of reflectarray cell element [41]. 
The behavior of loop element as the cell element of reflectarray can be under­
stood in terms of its behavior as the cell element of FSS [18]. The nature of loop 
resonance is amenable to a denser lattice as compared to the lattice size required 
to accommodate square patch element. On the other hand, multiloop structures 
lead to multiple resonances, as shown in Figure 8.25. It is seen that a wider phase

range can be achieved by multiloop structures, and the slope of the phase-length 
characteristics can be adjusted by modifying the gap between loops [40]. 
Phase response of multiple loop cell element has been contrasted with that of 
square patch in Figure 8.26, which shows a much wider phase range for multiloop 
structure. 
Multiresonant elements such as multiloop elements [38, 39] and stacked patch 
elements [40] provide the user with more degrees of freedom to tailor the required 
phase response. This flexibility is instrumental in the design of wideband large re­
flectarrays, which has been dealt with in detail in [3, 38, 40]. Dielectric resonant is

another type of resonant cell element that has been used in reflectarray structures 
[42, 43]. However, complexity of fabrication technology of dielectric resonators 
has hindered further development of reflectarrarys based on this type cell element.
Phase jump regions shown in Figure 8.27 appear as abrupt variations of the 
dimensions of resonant elements and are among the factors that degrade aperture 
phase efficiency of reflectarrays [3]. This phase jump occurs at the border of two 
adjacent Fresnel zones. Infinite periodic assumption is severely compromised in 
such regions. Therefore, special types of elements such as the one shown in Figure 
8.28 have been devised to overcome abrupt changes of geometry while maintaining 
the phase jump [44]. As can be seen, there is a high similarity between the first and 
last elements of phoenix cycle, which represent 0° and 360° phase shifts.
Variation of the loading of a resonant type cell is another means of obtaining 
the required phase shift. Selection of the type of loading technique and the type of 
resonant element gives rise to different types of cell elements. Figure 8.29 shows a 
resonant type patch that is loaded by the open-stub, where the variation of the stub 
length is used to change the phase of the reflected wave. The stub is synthesized to 
have the same characteristic impedance as the radiating edge impedance of the res­
onant patch [46]. The incoming signal is received by the patch element, traversed 
into the stub, reflected back upon encountering the open-circuit, and radiated back

from the resonant patch. A given phase shift can be achieved by adjusting the stub 
length. A different mechanism of loading can be achieved by embedding a slot of 
variable length on the ground plane of a microstrip patch, as shown in Figure 8.30 
[47]. Again, the patch is of resonant size, and variation of the slot length emulates 
variable loading on the patch, which pushes the patch off resonance and conse­
quently changes the phase shift of the reflected wave. This type of cell element has 
been used successfully in the context of steerable reflectarray by integration of ac­
tive elements within the slot structure [48, 49]. 
Another type of loading technique that has been used is based on true time 
delay (TTD) phase shift for broadband operation of the reflectarray shown in Fig­
ure 8.31. It is comprised of a resonant patch that is loaded by a stub through elec­
tromagnetic coupling via a slot on the ground plane [50]. A variation of the same 
type of cell element that is shown in Figure 8.32 can be used to achieve extended 
phase range with TTD characteristics [51]. Additional reflectarray cell elements 
that utilize the phasing mechanism based on loading the resonant element can be 
found in [52, 53].
The operation of cell elements that have been presented thus far is based on 
the resonance of the element itself. However, a different paradigm has been intro­
duced recently that is based on coupled resonance of the elements [54–56]. For

and resonance is achieved by coupling between neighboring elements. This type 
of element has been labeled as subwavelength coupled resonant (SCR) element. A 
comparison between the phase characteristics of SCR and resonant patch elements 
is given in Figure 8.33 [56]. Also, gain-bandwidth performances of two different 
reflectarrays that use SCR or resonant patch as their cell elements are given in the 
same figure. The realized phase range for the case of SRC patch is reduced as com­
pared to resonant. However, the reduced phase range does not severely degrade 
gain-bandwidth performance, as shown in Figure 8.33. Similar observations have 
been made for the resonant stacked patch and also SCR stacked patch structures 
[55].

Reﬂ ectarray Antennas
Recently, SCR loop elements have been suggested to reduce dielectric loss for 
a reflectarray that is etched on lossy substrate. This type of element can overcome 
some tight fabrication tolerances of SCR patch structures [28]. It is actually quite 
instructive to inspect field distributions for subwavelength and resonant loop ele-
ments, as shown in Figure 8.34. It is evident that the field concentrates in the 
region between the loops for the case of subwavelength lattice while it is strongest 
in the dielectric region underneath the element for the self-resonant type element. 
Concentration of E-field in the dielectric region for self-resonant element leads to 
higher loss in the presence of lossy substrate as confirmed in Figure 8.34(c). 
8.6 Different Types of Reﬂ ectarray Antennas
Relative flexibility in the synthesis of the response of the reflectarray cell element 
for the given frequency band and/or polarization leads to realization of different 
types of reflectarrays that are suited to particular operational specifications. Also, 
the lattice of reflectarray can be designed to accommodate more than one type of 
cell element, which leads to multiband and/or polarization reflectarray structures. 
Figure 8.35 shows a reflectarray structure that employs wide patches and nar-
row dipoles to cover Tx/Rx Ka-band dual orthogonal polarization [57]. Narrow 
dipoles were used to cover the Rx band of 19.2–20.2 GHz and wide patches car-
ried out the same function for the upper Tx-band of 29.0–30 GHz. Close view of 
reflectarray is shown in Figure 8.35(b) that depicts the varying dimensions of these 
two sets of elements that are orthogonal to each other to accommodate orthogo-
nal linear polarizations of the Tx- and Rx-bands. The coupling between the two 
cell elements of the two bands is rather low and allows for implementation of two 
separate focal points in order to allocate a dedicated focal point and feed assembly

layer, which is loaded by the stub through the slot on the ground plane. (b) Phase characteristics of

for each band of operation (see Figure 8.35(a)). Having separate feeds for each of 
the Tx- and Rx-bands simplifies the feed block and removes the requirement for 
orthomode transducer. 
The elements of both bands have been etched on the same substrate layer for 
the dual reflectarray that is shown in Figure 8.35. Another possibility is to have the 
elements etched on two different substrate layers, as shown in Figure 8.37. Circular 
loops with gaps were used as the cell element for both bands [58]. Lower band ele­
ments were placed on the top layer of the substrate, and upper band smaller loops 
were placed on the lower substrate. Simulations should be carried out to ensure 
low cross coupling between the elements of the two bands. The design process is 
more complicated in the case of significant coupling between the elements of the 
two bands, which can otherwise be designed in isolation of each other and super­
imposed in the final structure to achieve dual-band operation. Co-polarized and 
cross-polarized radiation patterns of the reflectarray in its two operating bands are 
shown in Figure 8.38.

Reflectarray Antennas
Circularly polarized reflectarrays have been intensely studied in the past. Two 
different methods have been suggested for realization of circularly polarized (CP) 
reflectarrays. In the first method, the reflectarray is fed by a CP feed. This method 
is based on the principle that by enforcing p phase difference between reflected 
phase responses of a cell element illuminated by two linear orthogonal polariza­
tions, the rotation of the cell element by angle y results in reflected phase response 
of 2y when the cell element is illuminated by CP incident plane wave [59]. There­
fore, the required reflected phase difference can be achieved by merely rotating the 
cell element. Figure 8.39 shows a candidate for the cell element for which p phase 
difference between the two orthogonal linear polarizations is achieved by adjusting 
the lengths of the two stub loadings. Rotation of the cell element is then used to ob­
tain the required phase difference for a reflectarray that is illuminated by CP feed. 
A reflectarray was designed based the guideline in [59], and the radiation pattern 
and axial ratio performance of the reflectarray are shown in Figure 8.40.

Another method for the realization of CP reflectarray entails feeding of the 
reflectarray by a linearly polarized (LP) feed and using reflectarray to simultane­
ously convert the incident LP illumination from the feed into CP and perform the

required phase front transformation [60]. Conversion of LP to CP is described in 
Figure 8.41, where cross dipole is utilized as the cell element. Orientation of the 
cross dipole with respect to the polarization of the incoming plane wave leads to 
equal decomposition of the field along the two arms of the cross dipole whose 
lengths have been adjusted to induce 90° phase difference between these two or­
thogonal field components and impart required phase shift to realize the specified 
phase front transformation. The same procedure that was presented earlier for 
the realization of LP-fed dual-band reflectarray can be followed to realize its CP 
counterpart. The elements of the two bands can be etched on the same substrate as 
described in [60] and presented in Figure 8.42. Extensive computer simulation was 
carried out to ascertain low cross coupling between the two arms of the given cross 
dipole cell element and between cell elements of the two bands [60]. The reflectar­
ray that was designed for Ka-band Tx/Rx operation is shown in Figure 8.43. Two 
LP horns were used to feed the reflectarray in either of its two bands of operation.

are shown in Figure 8.44. This dual band CP reflectarray is a good example of sig­
nificant simplification of the feed block as compared to the implementation of the 
same structure using conventional reflector technology.
Reflectarrays are particularly suitable for shaped beam applications. In the case 
of conventional reflector antenna, the shaped beam is achieved by mechanically 
shaping the reflector surfaces, whereas in the case of reflectarray, the same effect 
can be obtained by implementing the appropriate phase transformation to obtain 
the desired radiation aperture phase distribution. Two methods have been used to 
realize shaped beam reflectarray. In the first method, single reflectarray is used and 
its cell elements are synthesized to acquire a given phase transformation [61, 62], 
and, in the second method, which is based on dual reflectarray configuration, the 
same function is carried out by adjusting the cell elements of the subreflectarray 
[63, 64].

Reflectarray Antennas
A shaped reflectarray that utilizes stacked patch as its cell element was used 
to achieve dual coverage dual polarization operation [65]. The cell element and 
reflectarray configuration are shown in Figure 8.45. The two dimensions (length 
and width) of the stacked patch elements were used separately to acquire desired 
phase front transformations for the two orthogonal linear polarizations. The re­
flectarray, which is of elliptical shape with major and minor axis dimensions of 
1036 mm × 980 mm, operates at Ku-band to realize European contour beam for 
H-polarization and American contour beam for V-polarization. The coordinates of 
horns were selected as FV = (–440, 0, 887) and FH = (–302, 0, 898). The large size of 
the reflectarray, which was in excess of 30l0 in its operating band, necessitated the 
application of techniques to suppress spatial dispersion to maintain the bandwidth.

Typical contour plots of the reflectarray are shown in Figure 8.46, which demon­
strate dual coverage for dual polarized reflectarray.
Adjustment of the phase distribution on the aperture of the subreflectarray of 
a dual reflector/reflectarray configuration is another means of achieving contour 
beam. The configuration shown in Figure 8.47 that is comprised of a parabolic re­
flector and a shaped subreflectarray was selected in [64] to obtain a shaped beam. 
This particular configuration was preferred to other alternatives of reflector/re­
flectarray combinations because of bandwidth improvement, ease of fabrication, 
and possibility of realization of shaped beam by merely adjusting the phase of the 
element on the subreflectarray. Stacked patch was used as the cell element, and the 
phase distribution on the subreflectarray was adjusted for South American cover­
age at Ku-band. A shaped subreflector was first designed using physical optics and

then the required phase distribution on the subreflectarray aperture was obtained 
from the knowledge of the shaped subreflector. Figure 8.47 shows the dual re­
flector/subreflectarray configuration and typical contour beam generated by this 
antenna. 
Diversity in the types of reflectarrays that have been studied and reported in 
the literature goes well beyond what has been presented thus far in this section. To 
present a few more examples, [66] reports application of subreflectarray to mitigate 
the effect of surface error of the main reflector. On the other hand, a full account 
of design equations for hyperboloid and elliptical type subreflectarrays were pre­
sented in [67]. Folded reflectarray was introduced in [68] in order reduce the size 
of reflectarray by half, as shown in Figure 8.48. The top layer is a polarization filter 
comprised of conducting strips. The linear polarization from the feed is reflected by 
the top surface, and the bottom layer carries out the dual function of rotating the 
polarization of the field by 90° and imparting the required phase on the reflected

field in order to carry out the phase front transformation. The reflected field from 
the bottom surface passed through the top layer as a focused beam [68]. The same 
structure has been used for beam steering and beam shaping [69]. 
The printed technology that is used in fabrication of reflectarray makes it a 
particularly suitable candidate for integration of active elements to further increase 
its functionality [12, 70–72]. Figure 8.49 shows integration of MEM switches 
within a slot loaded patch cell element as a means of adjusting the reflection phase 
by enforcing a given switching configuration. The same function can be carried 
out by integrating varactor diodes into the cell element configuration, as shown 
in Figure 8.50. The lossy nature of active switches poses serious limitations on the 
further development of this type of reflectarray beam steering. Mechanical beam 
switching that involves marginal movement of the ground plane has been reported 
in [73]. The gain and sidelobe performances do not suffer as the beam is switched 
to off-broadside directions.
