Introduction 
Many companies have found themselves in the situation of bringing a great pro-
duct, service, or feature to the market, only to discover that the consumers simply 
didn’t get it. Other companies have brought to the market products that became 
successful without the companies having any clue why.  
Some may conclude that innovation is hence about pure luck. Nothing could be 
more wrong. Others may argue that perceived innovation can only come from 
companies that consumers already perceive as being highly innovative. My simple 
counter-question is, How did these companies build up a brand as being 
innovative in the first place? 
Very often, the success of products, services, webpages, and even companies 
and brands comes back to one single thing: successful user experience innovation.  
The Importance of User Experience 
User experience is basically the sum or flow of feelings that the customer gets 
when using your device, webpage, or system. In many businesses, the user experi-
ence of the product is already the key battlefield. Forget about launching the new-
est technologies unless you have designed a great user experience around them. 
Being first is no longer enough, and the winner is often the company that makes 
the new thing better than anyone else has.  
Just look at the mobile phone industry. Was Apple the first company to apply 
touch screens to a smart phone? No. Touch screens existed in the mobile phone 
industry at least ten years before Apple launched the first iPhone. But Apple 
managed to create an excellent user experience for this old technology. Nokia, 
which used to be seen as the leader in user experience, failed for several years to 
create even an acceptable user experience for touch screen devices, and this is now 
reflected very much in the market situation and in which companies run off with 
the profits. 
I will not claim that the methods described in this book are perfect, but I can say 
that these methods have helped me personally to create more than 100 filed patents, 
and they have helped me to create a number of truly successful user experience 
innovations for Nokia when Nokia was still seen as one of the top ten most 
innovative companies in the world. And when I say successful user experience, for me 
that means that I have seen or heard of a large number of users that actually loved 
my contributions to the mobile phone industry. My professional happiness does not 
depend on what my managers or the CEO says, but what I hear from real users.   
 

Introduction 
xvi 
The Goal for This Book 
My goal in this book is to share my methods for innovating so that you can try 
them out and put them into practice for yourself. They will help you create truly 
successful user experience innovations, which may not only help your company 
or organization to become profitable, but also help you grow as a user experience 
expert or innovator.  
Creating successful user experience innovation for your product will not only 
make your product more successful, but it can actually change the rules of an entire 
industry. I have personally had the luck to suggest user experience innovations 
that not only changed me and the company I worked for, but also the entire 
industry. For example, I managed to create the first SMS chat feature, as well as the 
first-ever game for a mobile device. And the customers loved these simple features 
since they covered real user needs. 
Motivation 
My view is that user experience already is—or soon will be—the key battleground 
for all types of consumer products, spanning from PC software to webpages to de-
vices, from social websites to remote controls, from word-processing software to 
portable music players, from smart phones to low-end phone devices, and more. If 
you in the consumer business market fail to meet rising requirements from the 
end user, then you and your company may soon become obsolete. That is a fact. 
User experience and user experience innovation are becoming the key compet-
itive factors in more and more industries. Consumers are demanding products that 
are not only easy to use but also joyful and fun to use. Consumers will choose the 
products that put a smile on their face when using the product. In other words, 
consumers will choose products with a great user experience. 
Why This Book? 
You may find hundreds of books describing how to create good usability, how to 
listen to customers, and how to create consumer insight. And you may even find a 
lot of literature describing how to involve users in your design process. But you 
will find very few books giving very concrete methods on how to create ideas and 
innovations around user experiences. 
To fill the gap in the literature, I will in this book describe tangible and straight-
forward methods on how you can create potentially successful user experience 
innovation. The methods and approaches are all based on methods that I have 
created, used, or applied successfully during my 18 years of creating user experience 
innovations for the mobile device industry, most of those years with Nokia. And 
even though the methods may seem simple, I can assure you that they work.  
This book starts by giving guidance on how to achieve the basic foundation for 
all successful user experience innovation—namely how to identify target users, 

Introduction 
 
xvii 
how to identify user needs, and how to find core tasks that the user performs when 
using your product. 
Based on these three core elements—target users, their needs, and core 
tasks—I describe how to easily create successful user experience innovation in 17 
different ways, spanning from how to directly use core tasks to create user 
experience innovation to how to create positive surprises and playful user 
experiences for the end user.  
User experience innovation is an approach that can be applied to any 
business—from situations such as purchasing tickets at a train station, to the 
experience users get when entering physical shops, to the experience when 
operating a specific device, webpage, or system.  
However, in this book I focus primarily on methods that can be used to create 
and design true and successful innovations for devices, webpages, and systems—
which in this book will be called products. And I will mainly focus on products that 
are designed for consumer-focused markets. 
My hope is that you will find one or ideally several of my methods and 
approaches useful and applicable for your specific design task, and I will look 
forward to seeing more great user experience innovations out there. 
Overview of Successful User Experience  
Innovation Methods 
There are hundreds or maybe thousands of well-documented methods on how to 
create new ideas. Many classical methods of creating ideas, however, have one 
important flaw: they do not take into account what the users need, what they like, 
what their passions are, what they have difficulties with, and so forth. And hence 
the ideas that come out may not likely be relevant for the end users. 
Successful user experience innovation always starts with the consumer in focus. 
The methods I suggest in this book approach user experience innovations from 
different angles, but they all keep the main focus on consumers and their needs. 
Overview of Methods and Chapters 
This book contains two short introductory chapters followed by 17 chapters giving 
tangible methods for user experience innovation. Following is a quick summary of 
the content: 
• 
Chapter 1: User Experience and Why It Matters: Introduces you 
to what user experience is, including some basic terms re-
lated to user experience. 
• 
Chapter 2: Innovating in User Experience: When is a user ex-
perience innovation a success? How did Apple manage to 
change the rules of the smart phone industry with a single 
product? What is important for your company or product to 

Introduction 
 
 
xviii 
become successful? These and other questions are answered 
in this chapter. 
• 
Chapter 3: Identifying Target Users: Discusses identifying and 
defining who you are targeting, which is absolutely key for cre-
ating successful user experience innovation. This chapter will 
give you some methods on how to identify your target users. 
• 
Chapter 4: Identifying User Needs: Gives guidance on how to 
find the user needs of your target users. User needs are the 
basis of all user experience innovation. 
• 
Chapter 5: Identifying Core Tasks: Provides methods for identify-
ing current and future core tasks for your product. Core tasks can 
be used directly or indirectly for user experience innovation. 
• 
Chapter 6: Innovating Around Core Tasks: Describes how to 
come up with user experience innovations directly based on 
the core tasks that users perform using your product. 
• 
Chapter 7: Innovating for New Technologies: Describes a tan-
gible method for creating user experience innovation around 
technologies by examining basic user needs. 
• 
Chapter 8: Innovating for Applications: Describes methods to 
create user experience innovation by focusing on how appli-
cations can be linked together seamlessly. 
• 
Chapter 9: Relieving the Pain: Shows how you can identify pain 
points in the user experience of your existing product(s). I will 
also describe how removing pain points from your user ex-
perience can improve your overall user experience radically. 
Finally, you will realize how you can use your pain points to 
create successful user experience innovations. 
• 
Chapter 10: Innovating Around First Impressions: Suggests 
methods to improve and innovate around the first impres-
sions of your webpage, device, or system. The first impression 
is essential for your product and how it is received and per-
ceived in the market. 
• 
Chapter 11: Creating Positive Surprises: The Wow Factor: Cov-
ers the importance of creating a wow factor for your product. 
Creating small—or big—positive surprises can change your 
product from a mediocre product to a winning product. Posi-
tive surprises and wow are key factors in successful user ex-
perience innovation. 
• 
Chapter 12: Innovating Around an Ecosystem: Helps you think 
beyond your product to the wider experience in which the 
product is used. User experience innovation is not only about 
improving the core of your product, but also very much about 
innovating for the entire ecosystem of your product. 

Introduction

• 
Chapter 13: Innovating with Lead Users: Why bother creating 
innovation inside the company if you can have lead users 
help you in the innovative process? This chapter describes 
tangible methods for this. 
• 
Chapter 14: Copying with Pride: Talks about copying and 
building upon the innovations of others. Most successful in-
novations in the world were not new when they were 
launched, but rather became successful because an innovat-
ing company came up with just the right implementation, or 
because the company applied an existing innovation to a new 
type of product or platform. This chapter will describe how 
you can copy with pride—but at the same time making sure to 
do it right. 
• 
Chapter 15: Innovating Around Paradoxes: Teaches how to re-
solve and benefit from conflicting needs. Paradoxes include 
conflicting user needs and conflicting needs from your 
shareholders and your management. In resolving paradoxes, 
you will find great opportunity to create successful products.  
• 
Chapter 16: Innovating Around Context Awareness: Suggests 
tangible methods to innovate around situational awareness 
in your products. Context awareness is the ability for your 
product to know the situation that your user is in, where the 
user is, and what he or she may want to do. Context aware-
ness can be a goldmine of potential successful innovation. 
• 
Chapter 17: Innovating Around New Products and Users: Walks 
you through using all previously described methods to create 
a superb user experience for a product with a new target user 
group, or for a completely new product. 
• 
Chapter 18: Prototyping and Verifying Solutions: Goes through 
tangible and simple methods to create prototypes and verify 
solutions with target users. Your user experience innovation 
ideas need to be verified with your target users, ideally at 
every step of your iterative innovation process. For any veri-
fication you will need one or more prototypes of some sort.  
• 
Chapter 19: Meeting Organizational Challenges: Describes ap-
proaches to use in challenging attitudes and old ways of 
thinking that get in the way of bringing successful user expe-
rience design to an organization or product. User experience 
innovations and ideas will never be heard in a majority of 
organizations and companies. This is very sad, not only for 
you as a user experience person, but also for your company. 
Tomorrow’s battleground for most consumer products will be 
on the user experience front, and if your company does not 
catch up, then the reality of losing market share and profits 
will be inevitable. This chapter can help you sell the need for 
good user experience design to management and colleagues.

Conclusion: Provides a short wrap-up to the book. 
Figure I shows the methods described in this book in conjunction with inputs 
such as user needs and technology choices. Looking at the figure you can begin to 
get a feel for how you can start thinking of user experience fro the standpoint of 
user needs and use the methods in this book to work through to successful product 
solutions. 
 
Figure 1. Overview of the methods for successful user experience innovation described 
in this book 
You will realize that several of the methods I describe in the following chapters 
are pretty obvious and straightforward. That is OK. Making these straightforward 
is the entire goal of the book. Demystifying user experience innovation and 
making it applicable to any company, organization, or person is precisely my 
purpose. 
I am not claiming that the methods in this book are the only right ways to 
create true user experience innovations. But I am claiming that they have worked 
for me. I have personally used all the described methods, and very often with 
success. The methods have led me to success when it comes to creating user 
experience innovations that consumers love, and that are profitable and 
patentable.

User Experience and  
Why It Matters 
This chapter will give a brief introduction to and definitions of terms like user ex-
perience, creativity, innovation, and successful user experience innovation. 
Many books have been written to define user experience, to define innovation, 
to boost creativity, and so forth, but the scope of this book is not to dwell on defini-
tions and academic descriptions of these terms. Many other authors have already 
done this much better. 
So this introductory chapter is rather here to just lay the ground for the tangible 
and intangible methods and approaches for user experience innovation that I will 
outline in the remainder of the book. 
What Is User Experience? 
According to ISO standards, user experience is defined as “a person’s perceptions 
and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or 
service.”1 
However, I will twist this basically correct definition a little. I would describe 
user experience as the feelings that the user gets when using a product. Using feel-
ings as a comparison model allows us to understand that the user experience can be 
anything from hate to love. From anger to happiness. From indifference to passion. 
From expectance to nostalgia. From pride to humiliation. And so forth.  
User Experience Curve 
When using a product (or when purchasing a device, sending it for repair, etc.), you 
can try to imagine the feelings that the user will have in different situations. Positive 
feelings mean that the user experience curve goes up, Negative feelings mean that 
the curve goes down. If the curve goes down too much—or drops repeatedly during 
the process—you will most likely lose the customer even before purchasing; or the

customer may end up being pretty unhappy most of the time using your product. 
And they will most likely not purchase a product from you again. 
Figure 1-1 shows an example of this “user experience curve” in a first-usage 
situation for a mobile device.  
 
Figure 1-1. Example of user experience curve 
One problem with feelings (and hence the user experience) is that different 
people react differently in different situations. And the same person may get differ-
ent feelings in the same situation depending on the context. If the user, for example, 
had a very stressful day, he may easily drop rapidly on the user experience curve 
compared to the same user going shopping on a relaxing summer vacation. 
And as with a personal relationship, the feelings may change over time, or even 
from day to day. Certain things may even make us go from happiness to anger in 
just seconds (e.g., if a software program crashes when you have just been using it for 
an hour, typing a long letter). Other things may become annoying to use when the 
user knows that there are better solutions out there. 
The goal is of course to maximize the positive moments for users when they’re 
using your product. And ideally to make your consumers love your product—at least 
some or most of the time. 
Another very important element—which is also described further in Chapter 9—
is to eliminate the worst negative feelings during usage of a product. One negative 
user experience may need ten good experiences to make the user happy again. 
Expectations and User Experience 
User experience is very much about expectations. Generally, if customers have low 
initial expectations, then your product can more easily surprise the customers posi-
tively (Figure 1-2).  

User Experience Innovation 
3 
 
Figure 1-2. Ideal user experience curve with low initial end-user expectations 
But for superb products and sustainable brands, you actually want the custom-
ers to have high expectations. High expectations basically mean that you can charge 
more for your products. If you manage to build up high user expectations for your 
products, however, then you need to match (or ideally, exceed) these expectations 
for your next product. Not fulfilling the expectations may be fatal (see Figure 1-3). 
 
Figure 1-3. User experience curve when not fulfilling high initial end-user 
expectations 
Expectations may depend on cultural differences, how customers perceive 
your brand, and a number of other things. But the essential part in the context of 
this book is to realize how a good—or bad—user experience will affect the expecta-
tions of your product.  
For a small local grocery shop, the customers may not expect the shop to have a 
full-blown superbly designed web page with photos and prices of all items, online 
sales, and so on.  
End-user expectations of the web page for a grocery shop may initially be low 
partly because the customers do not expect that from a small shop, but also partly 
because most users may not have a need for a high-end web page for such a shop. 
Many grocery buyers often prefer to enter the physical shop where they can touch, 
feel, and immediately purchase the products.  
However, these low end-user expectations can also be seen as a potential oppor-
tunity for a grocery shop that wants to stand out. If the owners actually choose to de-
sign a cool-looking web page with great user experience and online shopping, this 
may just be the thing that leads some customers into their shop and not the one next 
door. 
A good user experience can hence easily and quickly change customers’ expec-
tations. Expectations for your product are hence not fixed. They will in fact change

every time you—or your competition—raises the bar by providing successful user 
experience innovations. 
Anecdote 
Some years ago, most people did not feel a need to own a smart phone, since smart 
phones were seen as complicated high-end devices designed and intended for busi-
ness people (and they were in fact complicated to use). 
End users may have had a latent need for many of the core tasks that a smart  
phone could perform, but the hassle to get these tasks fulfilled was simply too 
overwhelming.  
The first iPhone (Figure 1-4) changed the perception of a smart phone being compli-
cated to use. And Apple changed the expectations of millions of users by allowing 
them to solve desired core tasks in an elegant and easy way.  
 
 
Figure 1-4. Apple changed the perception and expectations of smart phones. 
When Apple launches a new product, the expectations are always very high from 
their customers. And Apple can only survive by fulfilling or exceeding the customers’ 
expectations. 
User Experience vs. Consumer Experience 
User experience is limited to the actual usage of your product. Consumer experi-
ence, on the other hand, also covers the experiences that the user gets when looking 
up your product on the Internet, when seeing TV commercials, when entering a 

User Experience Innovation 
5 
shop, when giving the product back for repair, when replacing the product with an-
other, and so forth.  
In this book, I will focus mainly on the user experience; however, many of the 
methods described in this book will also apply to the consumer experience. Some of 
these methods will even directly touch upon how to innovate around the consumer 
experience (e.g., when I start describing methods to innovate the user experience 
around the ecosystem in Chapter 12). 
First Impressions Last 
Whether we like to admit it or not, we judge people very much on the first impres-
sion we get of them. Glance at the person in Figure 1-5. Do you have an impression? 
Very likely you do have an impression, and it’s from just one quick glance at a single 
image.  
 
Figure 1-5. First impressions last.  
There is also first impression for the user experience of a product. If your pro-
duct needs eight hours charging before you can turn it on, if the user is faced with 
tens of difficult questions before you can start using your web page, or if the user’s 
impression of the sales shop she enters is far from optimal, then you have given the 
user a very bad first impression of your product.  
In the best case, the result is that the customers will lower their expectations re-
spectively. This is, however, not good for any business, since it will also lower the 
price expectations of your product.  
In the worst case, you will lose existing customers, or you will leave the custom-
ers with a first impression that can take at least ten great user experiences to change 
into a positive overall experience. Figure 1-6 shows an example of how a poor first 
impression might take some time to overcome. 

User Experience and Why It Matters 
6 
Figure 1-6. Example of user experience curve when the first impression of your 
product is bad 
Many web page developers in the world do not understand that a Flash intro-
duction means losing a large amount of customers (even if it looks cool), simply 
because it may take tens of seconds or even minutes to load. Many owners of social 
websites mistakenly believe that users want to tell everything about themselves, and 
spend several minutes doing this even before they know what to use the website for. 
Many device manufacturers ask users to configure complex settings before even 
letting them get into the core functions of the device.  
So, in other words, your first impression lasts a lot longer than you think—and a 
bad first impression may already mean that you have lost a large amount of cus-
tomers. 
For tangible methods on how to create successful user experience innovation 
around first impressions, refer to the approach described in Chapter 10. 
Long-Term User Experience 
Many devices, web pages, software packages, and so on focus solely on the first im-
pression. This may in some cases make your consumers choose your product, but 
the same consumers will only return to your product next time if they also feel good 
during daily use of your product. 
Again, long-term user experience resembles a personal relationship. Yes, the 
first impression may make you get interested in or engaged with a person, but you 
will not maintain a relationship with the person unless they give you something 
back in the longer term. 
Long-term user experience is hence just as important as the first impression—
at least if you want your customers to come back to you next time. Ideally, you want 
a user experience curve similar to that in Figure 1-7, showing more or less constant 
growth in satisfaction over time. There will always be a few dips in the road, but the 
overall trend should be upward. 
Figure 1-7. Ideal user experience curve for long-term usage 

User Experience Innovation 
7 
A good long-term user experience is characterized by a daily joy when using a 
product. It is characterized by evolving together with the user, and by a growing 
“love” of your product from your users.  
The result of a good long-term user experience is that the end user will want to 
return to your product again and again. Usually a good long-term user experience is 
achieved by tiny things that keep surprising the user—or just making the user feel 
that he is in control of the product. Continuous successful improvements and up-
grades of your product are also important for the long-term user experience. 
Positive Surprises (Wows) 
A key element of a good user experience is providing small surprises for the user. 
These can also be called wows. These surprises of course need to be positive, and 
they can make people think or even say the word wow. Figure 1-8 shows an adver-
tisement with a certain wow effect. 
A wow could be something like a great and logical graphical layout where the 
user thinks, “Wow, this looks good.” It could also be a user interaction that is de-
signed in a playful way. Playfulness is a very essential part of wows and positive  
surprises.

advertising agency for brand: Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark. It was released in Dec 2009. 

User Experience and Why It Matters

Wows and positive surprises can also happen when the user discovers a small, in-
telligent function that, for example, helps him type text faster. Or they can refer to the 
pleasure the user feels when he finds a shortcut for an often used function on a web 
page.  
Positive surprises are needed on every level of interaction and usage, but focus 
should be made on core tasks that the user performs. Designing great interaction 
elements that users do not need or may not find is a waste of resources.  
Later in Chapter 11, I will describe concrete methods for creating successful 
user experience innovation around positive surprises. Then in Chapter 15, I’ll talk 
about how to create innovation for your core tasks. 
Negative surprises should be generally avoided, especially in the core interac-
tion of the product. But negative surprises—also known as pain points—can provide 
a very tangible approach to creating successful user experiences. (See Chapter 8 for 
more on pain points.)  
User Experience Applies to Everything 
User experience can be applied to almost all kinds of businesses. The user experi-
ence may seriously influence your brand, customer loyalty, and the amount of new 
customers considerably. Hence, it makes sense to take user experience very seri-
ously for any kind of business.  
For example, customers certainly get an impression of and feelings about a 
train company (Figure 1-9) if they have to wait 20 minutes in line to buy a train 
ticket, or if the trains are delayed frequently. 
 

User Experience Innovation 
9 
 
Figure 1-9. Example of user experience when purchasing train tickets 
Likewise, customers will remember the atmosphere, interior, staff, waiting 
times, and service when using a bank. And people will certainly have good and bad 
experiences when they use a product or visit a web page. 
People rarely use strong words such as love and hate about a product, but I am 
sure that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the world that would say that 
they love their social network service. You will also find thousands of people who 
love their iPhone, their Android product or similar, or even their bank. Finally, I am 
sure we have all hated our computer or a specific program when it crashes and de-
cides to throw away the data you’ve been working on for the last two hours. 
As mentioned, however, this book will focus mainly on how to create successful 
user experience innovations for devices, web pages, software, systems, and the like. 
But the book may still be good inspiration for organizations or companies who want 
to design a new shop interior layout, a better consumer experience when buying 
train tickets at the train station, and so on. 
Summary 
User experience is in my definition the changing feelings that a user gets when using 
a device, service, or system. User experience can come from a first impression. It 
can also come from positive and negative surprises experienced in the long term. 
The ideal user experience is when the user—most of the time—feels happy, satis-
fied, proud, or even in love. 

User Experience and Why It Matters 
10 
The ideal user experience can be achieved by knowing your target users and 
their needs, by focusing your design around core tasks, and by adding small positive 
surprises—in particular in the core interaction of your device.  
User experience covers many disciplines and functions in a company. It is 
about unpredictable users’ unpredictable feelings, and it covers basically any busi-
ness. It’s no wonder that many—especially smaller—companies give up even before 
considering improving the user experience.  
The remainder of this book will hopefully bring user experience innovation 
from a complex academic level to a tangible level. Creating great user experiences 
does not require a master’s degree, but it does require some practical tools and 
methods.

Innovating in User 
Experience 
The first chapter briefly introduced you to what user experience is about, but the 
core scope of this book is how to create successful innovations within the area of 
user experience. This chapter describes the basics of how to achieve successful user 
experience innovation. 
The Three Levels  
I distinguish between three levels of innovation in user experience: creativity, inno-
vation, and success. Success might seem like a strange choice, but it is important. 
Innovation without successful implementation is of little use and will not create 
products that create positive feelings for the user. 
Creativity 
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas. Basically any ideas. They can be new, 
they can have been used before in another context, and they can be copied and ad-
apted from a directly competing device. Figure 2-1 illustrates how the creative mind 
might work. There is a lot of chaos, but also a lot of raw material to work from. 
Creativity can be a gift granted to specific persons, but in most cases creativity 
is solely about using the right approach, having the right mindset, and using the 
right tools. Creativity is merely the ability to create an idea, without necessarily tak-
ing into account whether the idea covers any user need or can be implemented with 
currently available technology. Creativity itself will hence rarely make your product 
successful. Innovation is also needed.  

Innovating in User Experience 
 
12 
 
Figure 2-1. Creativity 
Innovation 
The majority of ideas created by teams or individuals in companies and organiza-
tions rarely make it to the market. My definition of innovation is to bring an idea to 
the market. This means that the term innovation automatically includes that the 
idea can be implemented with currently available technologies and resources. 
However, bringing an idea to the market does not necessarily mean that the in-
novation will be successful. Many innovations are never or rarely used, and these 
innovations will hence typically not provide any benefit (e.g., profit) for the com-
pany or organization bringing them out. The most common—and saddest—case is 
that the innovation is not even noticed; not by analysts, not by magazines, and not 
by the consumers.  
This tragedy of failed innovation often happens when a company launches a 
new technology that the user may feel sounds cool, but the company forgets to pro-
vide any valuable methods to use this new technology. Technology in itself very 
rarely sells any products.  
It also happens that companies actually design methods of using the new tech-
nology, but the users see no need for the functionality. Or a company may fail to 
design the functionality with an adequate user experience that makes users realize a 
need for the technology. Figure 2-2 shows an example of a clear innovation—
combining an orange with a kiwi—but one that has no obvious user need (at least 
for me).  

User Experience Innovation 
 
13 
 
Figure 2-2. Example of innovation with no (proven) user need 
Throughout the history of mobile phones and devices, there have been a large 
number of failed innovations where technology has been sold as the next great 
thing, but where either the implementation was not adequate or where the users did 
not see the need (examples are Wireless Application Protocol [WAP] and push-to-
talk [PTT]). Your technology—or rather the solutions you design for your technol-
ogy—has to cover an existing, perceived, or latent user need.  
By launching a good idea too early, by designing it with an insufficient user ex-
perience, by hiding it deep within menus, and so on, you may be wasting a lot of 
resources when developing your product and bringing your idea to the market, and 
you may also be opening a door for your competitors to copy your idea—and to de-
sign it right. 
Success  
Successful innovation is when a new (or old) idea is brought to the market that the 
markets, analysts, magazines, and most importantly, the users perceive as innova-
tive. Analysts and magazines may sometimes see it as successful innovation when 
you simply bring a new technology or idea to the market. However, the customers 
who pay your salary in the end are not so easy to trick. If they not do perceive or feel 
any value or relevance for your new technology, then you do not have a successful 
user experience innovation. Successful user experience innovation is when your 
users acknowledge and appreciate your ideas, and when they see them as innovative. 
Successful user experience innovation happens when the users feel that the in-
novation gives true value and is relevant for them. Hence, it comes back to the needs 
of the user. If the user feels that the innovation is relevant, cool, or amazing, then 
you may have created a successful user experience innovation. 

Innovating in User Experience 
 
14 
Most ideas are not new. Many innovations are not new either. But the company 
that manages to bring an idea to the market first with the right user experience is 
often seen as the real inventor of the idea. And the idea is seen as truly novel. His-
tory writers and users generally only remember the companies that did a new tech-
nology right, not the companies that did it first. 
Anecdote 
Did Apple invent the finger touch–enabled smart phone? No. But Apple was the first 
to make it with a good user experience. And therefore it became successful. Of 
course, the Apple brand and some other elements added to the success—but keep 
in mind that the success of the Apple brand comes not least from the user experi-
ence of Apple’s previous products. 
Characteristics of Successful User Experience 
Innovation 
Successful user experience innovation will make your consumer say “wow.” It will 
make your consumer smile, or it will make your consumer think, “This is clever,” or 
“What a positive surprise.” Success will only happen, however, if the user sees your 
solution, product, or service as relevant. Without need, there is no success.  
Another equally important, but much subtler, thought that users may have 
when operating your successful user experience innovation is, “This just works,” or 
“I got my task done.” They may not know why they feel this, they may not know all 
the intelligent user experience design and technologies that enabled this almost 
seamless interaction, but they just feel in control and comfortable. 
These feelings inside the user do not need to be strong—at least not all the 
time—but they should be there. They should be there when using the product the 
first time, when using the product longer term, when upgrading the product, and so 
forth. 
Figure 2-3 shows the five main characteristics of a successful user experience 
innovation: 
• 
Relevance 
• 
Positive feelings or wow 
• 
Perception of uniqueness or novelty 
• 
Visibility 
• 
Marketability

Figure 2-3. The five main elements of successful user experience innovation 
Relevance  
Relevance indicates that the user experience innovation you create is covering a real 
or latent need of the end users. Without need, the user experience innovation will 
not be successful.  
Positive Feelings 
A successful user experience innovation makes the user feel happy, satisfied, confi-
dent, comfortable, or positively surprised, and it may even give the user a wow ex-
perience with your product. Ideally, you want your users to love your product and 
the experience it gives. 
To trigger positive feelings with the user, your design needs to be inviting, sim-
ple, and focused. Negative feelings should always be avoided, and the causes of 
these feelings (usually pain points) should be eliminated. Several of the methods 
described later in this book help you to achieve positive feelings for the end user. 
Uniqueness or Novelty 
A successful user experience innovation is perceived as novel and unique. The tech-
nologies, applications, and solutions you use to generate that perception may not 
be new at all, but what counts is the perception of the end users, not so much the 
reality of the situation.  

Innovating in User Experience 
16 
For example, many people perceived the iPod as the first MP3 player. It’s easy  
to do research and prove otherwise, but for many people the iPod was the first MP3 
player they had ever heard of, and so was born the perception that the iPod was new 
and unique. 
Visibility 
You want to place your user experience innovation where a majority of your target 
users will experience it (e.g., in the core tasks of your product). User experience in-
novation placed in rarely visited corners of your product may give a small positive 
surprise when found, but it will rarely make your overall product successful. 
In some cases, successful user experience innovation is done in a hidden way. 
Maybe you have designed underlying intelligence that guesses what the user wants, 
and the user will consequently—if the product is designed right—be left with a posi-
tive feeling that “it just works.” However, since the user still notices that the product 
“just works,” this innovation can hardly be called invisible. 
In other words, innovation needs to be visible. Otherwise hardly anyone will 
ever see it, and hence it cannot be seen as an innovation. 
Marketability 
Successful user experience innovations can often be used in marketing campaigns. 
If your user experience is great, then it is difficult to find better ways to market your 
product than through these user experience innovations. 
Anecdote 
Many mobile phones have simple designs, like the one in Figure 2-4, and are spe-
cifically sold based on their simple user experience. The same goes for a number of 
other products, including systems, software packages, and electronic devices of all 
sorts.  

User Experience Innovation

Figure 2-4. A mobile phone designed around a simple user experience 
The Value of User Experience Innovation 
The value of user experience innovation is threefold: 
• 
Successful user experience innovations will make your product 
stand out from the competition. The customers will most likely 
prefer your solution and product. 
• 
User experience will become the key battlefield for competi-
tion in the future, and it already is the main battle ground in 
many current areas. 
• 
User experience innovation is and will continue to be the main 
brand-building tool. 
Anecdote 
Nokia used to rule the mobile device industry and was seen as the absolute innova-
tion leader in the mobile phone industry. It was famous for its superior user experi-
ences, but at a certain point the market and consumers began to lack new and 
valuable user experience innovations from Nokia.  

Innovating in User Experience 
 
18 
What made customers switch from traditional keypad-based mobile phones to finger 
touch–operated smart phones? Was it the technology itself? Definitely not, since the 
technology was available on devices more than ten years before Apple reinvented it 
for the iPhone. It was even available on devices from top-branded mobile device 
manufacturers, so the Apple brand cannot account solely for the success either.  
The answer is simple: Apple managed to create a user experience for finger-touch 
technology that customers saw a real value in. Users felt that the coolness and 
benefits of such a device were enough for them to start learning a completely new 
interaction paradigm. And Apple designed this interaction so cleverly that the transi-
tion was not hard at all. 
Apple saw this sweet spot, and it created the iPhone with successful user experi-
ence innovation. Apple entered the market, and within a few years it basically took 
away the high-profit smart phone market from Nokia.  
Does Innovation Conflict with Good User  
Experience? 
When operating a product (a software program, a device, a web page, or similar), 
users may be reluctant to face radical innovation and changes in the interaction 
paradigm. When users buy a new product, they often feel most comfortable when 
they feel familiarity and can operate the product from day one. 
So one could argue that innovation is in conflict with good user experience. 
However, I disagree with this. Instead I believe that user experience will become the 
key tool for most innovation in the future—whether it’s the experience you get in 
your jewellery shop, or the one you get for devices, web pages, software programs, 
and so forth. 
Yes, new technologies will continuously appear and mature, but technology in-
novations alone do not make successful innovation. The user experience and the 
clever ideas around the technology are what give users value, and this value is what 
will make successful innovations. 
Innovation for the sake of innovation is seldom successful. Users need to feel a 
true (real or potential) value to change their habits and to learn new interactions. 
Consider for a moment the gas and brake pedals in a car (Figure 2-5).  
 

User Experience Innovation 
 
19 
 
Figure 2-5. What if we swap the gas and brake pedals?  
Let us for example assume that a car manufacturer decides to swap the brake 
pedal with the gas pedal. The car manufacturer may have found out that it would 
give a better-looking visual design and a long-term ergonomic improvement. This is 
certainly an innovation, and studies and tests may even support that the user ex-
perience would be better in the long run. But obviously swapping the gas and brake 
pedals would never be a successful innovation. The swap would require too much 
for users to adapt to. Users would feel no incentive to learn this new interaction be-
cause they would not see a real value. 
If a car manufacturer instead totally redesigned a car to give it lots of real value 
and novel functionality, the innovation might be successful. One such successful 
example was when cars began to come with automatic gear shifters instead of 
manual ones. The benefits were obvious and for most users desirable, and hence 
users wanted to adapt to this new technology.  
Therefore, if you bring real (perceived or true) value to a product that users 
think is relevant, then you may be able to create even a radical innovation that is 
successful. 
But innovation in itself is in no way conflicting with user experience. In fact, I 
would claim that in the near future, most innovation will be focused purely on the 
user experience. In other words, user experience will be (and already is) the main 
tool for innovation for devices, web pages, software programs, shopping experi-
ences, and basically any other experience you can think of.

Summary 
This chapter defined and explained key elements needed for successful user experi-
ence innovation, including what it is, what characterizes it, and what its value is. 
Subsequent chapters will provide tangible methods for creating successful user ex-
perience innovations.

Identifying Target  
Users 
For all of the innovation methods described in this book, it is essential to identify 
the end-user needs, which for simplicity I will call user needs. However, before you 
can find out the user needs, you will need to identify and define who your target 
users are.  
Defining New Target Users 
If your company already has a successful social website for teenagers, but you want 
to create a similar website for other users, you may need to start defining who the 
target users should be. Should your website be for elderly people looking to talk to 
their grandchildren? Or should you instead focus on tweens? Or should you create a 
social website for exotic butterfly enthusiasts? You may have several possible groups 
in mind, as illustrated in Figure 3-1, but your goal should generally be to narrow this 
down to just one group, or at least a few groups that are related. 
 
Figure 3-1. Defining a new target user group 

Identifying Target Users 
 
22 
If you have a start-up company, you’ll probably already have certain target 
users in mind when you start creating your first product, but it is still worth con-
sidering other target users from the beginning.  
Having multiple target user groups may be a big advantage for some types of 
products. However, targeting multiple groups also has some pitfalls. You can’t al-
ways please multiple groups at the same time. 
How to find specific new groups of users to target is out of the scope of this 
book, and will depend on a variety of factors, including the current competition, the 
nature of your product(s), and the disposable income of the different groups you are 
targeting.  
Larger companies often use internal or external market research to identify new 
potential target users. Smaller companies may lack the resources for extensive mar-
ket research, but may have intrinsic insight into markets that can be profitably tar-
geted. One thing, though, is for sure: you need to thoroughly investigate the market 
to find out who the potential target users for your product are. 
Some companies tend to automatically choose target groups that are similar to 
their current user base. This can be a safe choice in some situations. In other situa-
tions, this sort of inward focus may cause a high risk of overlooking great opportuni-
ties with completely different target user groups. 
Targeting a Predefined User Group 
In large companies, user experience designers are often given a specific target user 
group as the starting point for the innovation work. Mature adults with a relatively 
large disposable income is an example of such a predefined group. You will often 
want to display these users with a representative photo, like in Figure 3-2, before 
continuing your work. A photo of your typical target users can help you a lot in the 
proceeding steps.  
Depending on the quality of the market research, the research material may 
also contain a number of insights for the predefined group of users that you are tar-
geting. This research may even specify end-user needs. 
However, in almost all most cases, you will want to find, interview, and get to 
know your target users better. This is because innovation is much easier when you 
have faced the target users than it is when you solely base your innovation on mar-
ket research data and statistics. Even when needs are well defined by current re-
search, you are well advised not to skip the interviewing process. After all, data and 
statistics can take you only so far.

Determining the Group Size 
Your target user group should be wide enough to make your product interesting for 
enough users so that you believe that your product can be profitable. How large a 
target user group should be will depend on your product, the target users, and the 
market situation.  
Figure 3-3 illustrates the choice between a small and a large group. If you are 
designing a web page for customers in low-income countries, you may need mil-
lions of customers to make your business profitable. If you design a mobile device 
for oil billionaires, you may not need any more than ten customers for your product 
if you can achieve enough profit from each device.  
 
Figure 3-3. Narrow or wide target user group? 
At the same time, you generally want to keep your target user group as narrow as 
possible. Creating user experience innovation that will be successful for several mil-
lions of very different people is impossible. The reason is that you will end up spread-
ing your focus and innovations too much. And you may also end up cluttering your

user experience with hundreds of functions and technologies in an attempt to satisfy 
everyone. 
So you want the size of your target user group to be big enough for your product 
to become profitable. And you also want your target user group to be small enough 
to actually be able to trigger some potentially successful user experience innovation. 
Like the shoes in Figure 3-4, there is no one, correct size. 
 
Figure 3-4. One size does not fit all  
If the marketing department in your company has already defined a target user 
group, you will, as a user experience innovator, want to review and challenge their 
choices if you can identify obvious flaws in their decision. You will also want to dig 
into the research material that they have. If your marketing team has defined “the 
world” as the target user group, you should probably ask them to go back and redo 
the research they have done so far.  
Designing for Multiple Target Groups  
How do you design for multiple groups (Figure 3-5) while maintaining focus and not 
diluting your efforts to the point of failure? One approach is to define one core target 
group of users, but also keep a number of side target groups in mind during the in-
novation process. This will ensure that you do not limit your solutions too much. It 
may also make it much easier for you to later expand your target user group easily. 
Since you’ll already know which other target users could become interested in your 
product if the solutions you offer are twisted a little bit, you can more easily adapt. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
25 
 
Figure 3-5. Multiple target user groups 
For example, if you are designing a mobile phone for low-income consumers in 
entry markets, you should try from the beginning to imagine other markets—or ra-
ther other target users. Maybe a low-priced mobile phone will also nicely target the 
elderly in mature markets, or perhaps tweens in North America with low disposable 
incomes. 
However, keep the focus mainly on your core target user group. If you, for ex-
ample, try to define innovations and solutions for consumers in low-income mar-
kets, elderly people in mature markets, and tweens in North America all at once, you 
will most likely fail. In most cases, you should keep your focus in all innovations on 
your core target users, but keep your secondary target users in mind also.  
Sometimes you will realize that there are overlapping needs and solutions 
among your target user groups. If this is the case, you may be able to create solu-
tions that apply to many more people than originally targeted. You may, for exam-
ple, find out that both elderly people in mature markets and low-income users in 
entry markets (who may not be able to afford reading glasses) may need large fonts 
on mobile phone displays to make the text readable. 
But in cases where the needs are conflicting, you should always prioritize your core 
target users. Tweens in North America may, for example, want as many functions 
and as much information as possible displayed at once, whereas your core target 
users in low-income markets may have the opposite need. 

Identifying Target Users

Anecdote  
Facebook was originally designed and intended only for students at Harvard Univer-
sity. Only later was it extended to other colleges in the Boston area, and then be-
yond.  
Today, Facebook has more than 800 million active users.1 Facebook is hence a bril-
liant example of a product that was originally defined for a very narrow group of tar-
get users, but for which other potential target user groups were considered at an 
early stage.  
Summary 
Defining who your target users are is an essential step, since it will not only help you 
focus your innovations, your approach, and your marketing, but it will help you 
avoid creating a product that tries (and fails) to do everything for everyone.  
Many products in this world were designed without specific customers in mind, 
and this is usually reflected in the lack of success of these products. 
The conclusion is that defining—or identifying—your target users is a fine bal-
ance between using a small enough target user group to spark innovation, and at 
the same time defining a big enough target user group to allow for future growth.

Identifying User Needs 
User needs are the cornerstones of all successful user experience innovation. If your 
product, solution, or functionality does not cover existing or latent needs of the tar-
get users, then all your efforts in creating a great user experience for this solution 
may well be wasted. In other words, your user experience innovation will never be 
successful unless you cover an existing or latent end-user need. 
If you create a device that end users do not need, it will not sell. If you design a 
function for your word-processing software that users do not need, that function 
will never be used. If you create functionality or services on your web page that the 
user does not see any value or need for, these will not be used. 
This may sound very logical, but it is amazing to see how many (unsuccessful) 
products and solutions are launched every year for which there is no or very limited 
user need. If you are adding functionality with no underlying user needs, you may 
not only be wasting resources on developing this functionality, but you may be de-
creasing the overall user experience of your product, simply because more functions 
generally mean decreased usability. 
User Needs vs. Fundamental Human Needs 
Researchers recognize a fairly well-defined set of fundamental human needs. These 
include the need for affection, for leisure, for protection. You would seldom use 
these human needs directly as the starting point for your innovation, even though in 
some cases and for some products such needs may be relevant. 
Instead, you want user needs expressed as more tangible desires (Figure 4-1), 
wishes, or even dreams for your specific product. And you want your user needs to 
already be specific for your target users, reflecting cultural and human differences. 
In many cases you can actually relate user needs directly back to fundamental 
human needs like protection, creation, identity, freedom, and so on. In the example 
in Figure 4-1 the underlying fundamental human need is clearly about safety and 
protection or even survival. 
 
 

Identifying User Needs

Figure 4-1. Example of a user need 
User Needs vs. Core Tasks  
User needs should also not be confused with core tasks, even though there is some 
resemblance. Core tasks are specific tasks that the user is already performing or ex-
pects to perform, whereas user needs express an existing or latent need related to a 
product. I would hence define the difference as follows: a user need may lead cer-
tain tasks to become core tasks over time, but never vice versa.  
It is possible to innovate around core tasks, however. You’ll read more about 
how to do that in Chapter 6. 
Types of User Needs 
I usually distinguish between three types of user needs: immediate user needs, per-
ceived user needs, and latent user needs. These three types of user needs are briefly 
introduced next. 
Immediate User Needs 
Immediate user needs are the needs that users have here and now, and that most 
users can imagine and articulate. An example is, “I want this device to improve the 
safety of my family.” Another example might be, “I want a device to inflate my bicy-
cle tire.” 

User Experience Innovation 
 
29 
Existing user needs also very much reflect user expectations. For example, a 
user visiting a site perceived as a social networking site might state, “I expect this 
web page to help me get in contact with my friends.” 
Immediate user needs are important to fulfill—for example, when selling a pro-
duct or when users have just entered a certain web page and they are considering 
whether to spend more time on that page. Immediate user needs are, however, of-
ten a bit transient. They can change easily and rapidly. A user’s immediate need for 
Facebook, for example, might change from posting entertaining photos one day to 
sending a serious note to a relative in the hospital the next.  
Perceived User Needs 
Perceived user needs are different from immediate user needs. Perceived user needs 
refer to tasks that the users—falsely—expect your product to solve. Perceived user 
needs are often superficial and created by hype in the market, or by marketing cam-
paigns that make users believe they have a need for a certain product when they 
truly don’t. Marketing alone does not, however, ensure a successful user experience. 
So be careful with these needs. They may set the user’s expectations too high, 
which can ruin both the first impression of your product and the long-term user 
experience. 
The term perceived value should not be mixed up with the term perceived user 
need. Perceived value is certainly something to aim for, since it reflects that the user 
actually does see a value (be it illogical or real). On the other hand, a perceived need 
is often a superficial user feeling, which can lead you down the wrong track when 
innovating for user experiences. 
Anecdote  
When the first Internet-enabled mobile phones were introduced using the WAP stan-
dard, the industry, analysts, magazines, and marketing campaigns hyped this new 
technology to extreme heights. What happened after the launch of these devices 
was foreseeable for a user experience expert, but the results were devastating.  
People expected a real Internet browser, and instead they got a very simple and ex-
pensive Internet connection with almost no web pages to visit. Luckily, consumers 
liked some of the first devices, such as the Nokia 7110 (shown in Figure 4-2), for 
other reasons—for example, the slide-out mouthpiece, the big display, the roller 
key, and so on.

Latent User Needs  
The term latent user needs covers in my definition both needs that the user already 
has but cannot imagine or articulate, and needs that the user may not even have yet. 
Latent needs can often be identified by observing the users of your product. Imagine 
that you are observing a user who is using your e-mail application, and you see him 
try to retype the content of the e-mail into a calendar reminder. The user may not be 
able to imagine easy solutions for moving the text over to the calendar, and hence he 
cannot express the need for a function to make that task easier. But you as the ob-
server can easily identify the perceived need (see Figure 4-3).  
 
Figure 4-3. Example of a latent user need 

User Experience Innovation 
 
31 
A latent need for parents might be a device or web page that allows them to see 
the exact location of their children (this may not, however, be a need for the chil-
dren). But if the users can’t imagine that this may actually be possible, it won’t be 
expressed as a need. 
Hydration packs represent an excellent example of a latent need translated into 
a successful product. Hikers, cyclists, skiers, and other outdoor enthusiasts have a 
need for water. Yet by and large, no one had been asking for a way to carry a bag of 
water on their back until the creators first saw the latent need, and then worked tire-
lessly to help others see it also. The result is that one hardly sees an outdoor sports 
enthusiast today who isn’t carrying a bag of water.  
A great visual or industrial design of your device or a surprising wow—function 
in your software package may also meet latent needs for beauty, joy, and surprise. If 
you, for example, buy a car and later realize that it can parallel-park automatically, 
you may be extremely satisfied with your car for covering a need that you would 
never have thought to express directly. 
 Note  Don’t think that you can avoid worrying about latent needs when designing tools 
that people are required to use in their work. The doctor who buys an iPhone will soon come 
to demand similar usability and joy from the products used in his medical practice.  
Latent needs will almost never be expressed by the user (except maybe for a few 
lead users; see chapter 13), and can hence only be captured by observers who spe-
cifically look for them. Observers such as user experience experts hence must de-
velop skill in detecting underlying needs during interviews, observation, and some-
times even usability tests. 
Latent needs are crucial for user experience innovation, since they can often 
put you one step ahead of competition. Using feedback from customers is becom-
ing quite common, but often that feedback is mainly used to fix pain points, as de-
scribed in Chapter 9. Trying to look ahead—or into the underlying latent needs of 
customers—is still not common, and doing so may thus give you a competitive edge 
in your current market situation.  
Remember that growth in almost all consumer-oriented industries does not 
come from lowering the cost of your products, but from creating great experiences 
when your users are using your products. A great user experience can create a tre-
mendous value in a product. In today’s economy, cost is certainly still important, 
but if you provide the user with a great experience (e.g., feeling), you can charge 
almost anything for your product.

Anecdote 
My editor on this book purchased his first-ever mountain bike in 2002 for what 
seemed to him the extravagant sum of $350. Four years later, in fall of 2006, his 
dealer loaned him a full-suspension bike for the weekend. The loan of that bike 
awakened a latent need, and in spring of 2007 my editor spent $3,300 on a high-
end suspension bike—almost ten times what he originally believed to be an ex-
travagant price. He rides more and is now fitter than he has been in a decade. What 
made the difference? It was the fantastic user experience from the higher-end bike.  
Interview your users. Observe them. Carefully consider their actions and 
whether any of those actions represent latent needs that can be addressed by cre-
ative solutions in and surrounding your products. Several of the user experience 
innovation methods in the remainder of this book will give concrete guidance on 
how to innovate for latent user needs. 
Approaches to Identifying Needs 
Assuming you already have a good understanding of who your target users are, 
which you should have from Chapter 3, the next step is to identify the needs of these 
users. There are many well-documented methods for identifying the needs of your 
target users; I will go through some of these methods in the sections to follow. 
Finding Specific Target Users 
Finding target users may sometimes be a little bit tricky. For example, if you are 
looking for tweens in your own market area, you can probably easily find some sim-
ply by walking the streets near your office or home. If your target users are people 
interested in butterflies from southern Borneo, you may want to try searching the 
Internet for potential existing butterfly or insect communities. If you are looking for 
tweens also interested in butterflies from southern Borneo, you are probably defin-
ing your target group to be too narrow. 
If you are designing a product similar to what you already have on the market, 
you can look in your current database of customers, and you can browse through 
your consumer complaint database if you have one, or ask some colleagues working 
with customer feedback on a daily basis.  
In some situations where you are looking for very specific user profiles, you 
may want to ask an agency to find suitable target users for you. Asking these agen-
cies purely for names and addresses of specific types of users usually does not cost 
a fortune.  
If you are targeting users that you have not been in contact with before, you 
may get more inspiration from Chapter 15, where I will go through the entire user 
experience innovation process for a product targeted at a new user group. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
33 
Contacting Target Users 
The next step is to make initial contact with your target users. This can be done via 
e-mail or telephone, or by spotting them on the street. You will often be very sur-
prised at how willing users will be to help you. They may sometimes happily take 
time off from their job to meet up with you for a few hours. You can contact some of 
your target users and ask them in for a session, or simply interview them via phone. 
E-mail interviews and web surveys may also be options, but—as mentioned later—
these methods are less reliable. 
Talking to Your Target Users 
Talking to your target users may sound so obvious that it is not worth mentioning. 
However, you’d be surprised at the number of companies that omit this step. It is 
vital to actually talk to your target users. 
Many companies do not even use existing feedback channels when they create 
new innovation. Most companies already have several ways to relate to their end 
users, such as e-mail inquiries and complaints, help lines, and so on, but these me-
dia are in many cases only used to give relief to users’ frustrations. They are seldom 
used in the innovation process. 
Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you must hire a research company to 
perform extensive and expensive market research. Doing so may be fruitful for lar-
ger companies. But if your resources are sparse, you can do research yourself very 
easily. Finding user insights is in my mind the absolute most prominent source of 
successful user experience innovation, so you certainly don’t want to leave out the 
vital task of actually talking to your target audience. 
In the following sections I will go through some of the methods of determining 
end-user needs that I personally have found most fruitful for sparking great 
innovations. 
Interviewing Users or Potential Users 
As indicated, talking to your users or potential users is essential. An alternative is a 
more formal way of interviewing people about their use of your product. This can 
bring you a number of insights and alert you to end-user needs. Interviewing people 
will sometimes automatically make the people more positive. It is very difficult for 
users to express negative elements of your product when interviewed, especially if 
you use a video or sound recorder. You see the same thing when a person from a 
political party interviews or questions people on the street.  
The trick is to read behind the person, and to read what the person really 
means. They may tell you initially that your product is the best in the world, but try 
to listen to what they say after that. For example, they might say, “I love your pro-
duct, but when I need to create a calendar reminder, I have some difficulties.” The 
trick is to listen to everything that comes after the “but.” You should also try to 
understand the basic needs of the person. This is usually where you will find true 
sources for later innovation around the user experience. If a person says to you that 

Identifying User Needs 
 
34 
they love your product, but that they care more about the safety of their family, 
maybe the last part is where you should pay attention.  
You can stop and interview people on the street, you can e-mail some of your 
users from your existing customer base, you can invite some specific users to a 
workshop, you can do web surveys, and you can interview people in their homes 
(see Figure 4-4).   
 
Figure 4-4. Example of interviewing a target users in their home 
Which method to choose may depend on the product that you are designing, 
and it will depend on the target users. Here are some examples:  
• 
If you are designing a TV remote control, you might want to 
interview people in their homes so that they can show how 
they usually use your device in the place where they use it. 
• 
If you are designing a web page, service, or device for physi-
cally challenged users, you will likewise want to visit them in 
the place where they use your product. 
• 
If you are designing a web page for teenagers, you may want to 
visit the teenagers in their rooms, in an Internet café, or wher-
ever they most typically would use your product.  
• 
If you are designing a mobile phone, asking people on the 
street may be suitable if the scope of your innovation is some-
thing that they would use when walking on the street. 
The method you use for your interviews is for your discretion and judgement 
based on the product you are designing. But keep in mind that the goal of your 
interview is to find existing or latent needs.

Anecdote  
During my time with Nokia, I organized and participated in a large number of crea-
tive workshops. I participated with people from different disciplines of R&D, as well 
as from marketing, product planning, and management. 
You may often experience that people attending a workshop will bring predefined 
opinions, solutions, and ideas. A very good way to reset—or rather to focus—the 
participants minds at the start of a creative workshop is by asking the people to per-
form street interviews for a few hours. Simply ask your participants to stop people 
walking on the street and ask about needs for your product. 
Performing street interviews may not necessarily give you a huge number of new in-
sights, but it may certainly give your participants a renewed view on your product 
and why innovation is needed. Insights found by people themselves tend to be much 
more influential than those found by reports from a market research agency. 
However, whether you choose street interviews, phone interviews, e-mail inter-
views, web surveys, market research, or a combination will depend on the com-
plexity of your product and the target users. 
Empathic Design 
Emphatic design is a variation of user observation. With this technique, you as the 
observer look for underlying feelings to identify latent user needs.1 In many ways, 
empathic design is a matter of how you observe users. It takes some practice to see 
beyond the obvious user needs to the latent needs, but with a little bit of practice 
most people can do it. Alternatively, you may want to use a professional user experi-
ence expert to help you out.  
When you start learning to see latent needs, you will automatically start to see 
latent needs when you observe people in public—on trains, buses, the street, and 
other places. You will be surprised about what insights and latent user needs you 
can find this way. 
Anecdote  
In 1999 I was sitting on a train on the way back home from work. I couldn’t help ob-
serving a teenage girl using her mobile phone. She was writing texts at high speed, 
and the constant sound of incoming messages told me that she was also receiving 
many messages. I ended up saying out loud that she certainly had many friends, and 
to my surprise she said that she was only communicating with a single person, her 
best friend. 
                                                
1 For more information on empathic design, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathic_design. 

Identifying User Needs 
36 
At this time in mobile phone history, mobile phones had no conversational SMS read-
ing view, so when she received a new message from her friend, she would have to 
exit the writing of the current message, go to standby mode, read the new message 
received, and return to the text editor to continue writing her message. I concluded 
from this that this specific user had a latent need for a method where SMS communi-
cation with a single user was much easier than what was the case at that time. 
The next day at work I designed—and patented2—the first ever chat function for a 
mobile phone, the so-called SMS Chat feature (Figure 4-5). Of course, this insight 
needed a lot more verification and  selling inside the company, but the SMS Chat 
feature was developed and launched in 2000 for one of the most successful mobile 
devices ever, the Nokia 3310.3  
Figure 4-5. The original version of SMS Chat for the Nokia 3310 
The SMS Chat feature ended up as one of the key unique selling points of the 3310,4
and you will still find an unmodified version of this function in low-cost mobiles from 
Nokia. You will also find this same functionality in modernized versions on Nokia de-
vices, iPhones, and so on. 
Market Research 
Market research is basically no different from stopping and interviewing users on 
the street. However, you may not have time to interview hundreds of users and gen-
erate statistical data based on the interviews. You also may not have the same ex-
perience in interviewing users as professional agencies have. Finally, you may not 
have the time to do it yourself.  
In this case, having professional market research done may be an option. It will 
surely cost you more money, but you may in return get data that is more precise, 
better documented, and covers more users than what you could have generated 
yourself. Interviewing random people on the street may give you very good inspira-

tion for what a specific user wants, but market research may give you much more 
precise data about the users you are targeting. 
Market research can provide you with more precise data about the needs of 
your target users, but it may take longer, and it won’t give you the hands-on experi-
ence that in itself can be a great source of inspiration for user experience 
innovation. 
 Note  If you already have good market research data, I still recommend trying out, for 
example, simple street interviews—not because the experience of interviewing people on the 
street will necessarily give you better data, but because it is a great source of innovation.  
A Day in the Life 
If the product that you are designing will have many contact points with the user 
during a day, you may choose a day-in-the-life method (Figure 4-6). This is a practi-
cal approach in which you interview target users about a typical day in their life, and 
you can learn when and why they might choose your product to accomplish some of 
their daily tasks. You may also choose to follow a user throughout an entire day and 
simply take notes.  
 
Figure 4-6. A day-in-the-life example 

Identifying User Needs 
 
38 
This approach may be applicable to social web pages, certain software pro-
grams such as word processors and e-mail clients, mobile phones, remote controls, 
and so forth. If your product does not naturally have many contact points during a 
day, you might change this to a week-in-the-life or a month-in-the-life exercise. 
Not only will this exercise provide you with specific, immediate end-user needs 
for your product, but it may also provide you with indirectly expressed latent user 
needs. If you can convince the user to let you take photos during the day, you will get 
a lot of concrete footage and inspiration for the succeeding innovation work. 
Furthermore, this exercise may give you indications of the what the user’s core 
tasks are (see Chapter 5), as well as the current pain points that the user is experi-
encing (see Chapter 9). 
User-Created Diaries 
Another approach to finding user needs is to ask target users to create diaries about 
their life, and about how, when, and where they use your product (see Figure 4-7).  
 
Figure 4-7. User-created diaries 
Several agencies specialize in finding users that match your target user group. 
These users are more than willing to create loads of diary material—and hence end-
user needs—for a relatively small sum of money. In some cases, giving these users 
one of your products may be enough.  

User Experience Innovation 
 
39 
 Note  Remember that if you have customers that truly like your product already, these 
customers may be willing to go a long way for you. Use that. And use their expertise. 
Lead User Workshops  
Most of the target users for your product will have difficulties expressing their needs 
for your product. And a vast majority of your target users will certainly not be able to 
come up with the innovations themselves. There will always be some users who are 
exceptions, though—those who are leaders and trend setters. These are the lead 
users of your product, and they are the ones you should seek out and bring into a 
workshop (Figure 4-8). 
 
Figure 4-8. A user workshop 
If you are designing a web page, you might look for users who are already mak-
ing additions or modifications to your web page. If you are designing slide presenta-
tion software, you will be looking at the people who are already creating Visual Basic 
plug-ins for your software. If you are designing a mobile phone, you will be looking 
for users who are already writing their own applications or tweaking the software. If 
you are designing a TV remote control, you may want to look for users who disas-
semble your unit and make their own modifications.  
Lead users may not necessarily represent the needs of your typical target users, 
since they sometimes have niche needs that are not common for your overall target 

Identifying User Needs 
 
40 
user group, but these users can be valuable in many other ways. In Chapter 13 I will 
describe how to create innovations together with lead users. 
Rules for Interviewing End Users 
You and your colleagues may not be used to stopping people on the street to inter-
view them. You may not be used to entering their homes. A few dos and don’ts are 
needed if you choose to approach your target users yourself.  
You can find numerous articles, books, and blogs on the subject of interview-
ing. Here I will just emphasize a few key guidelines. Most of the benefit will come 
from the few guidelines I list here.  
• 
Do not ask leading questions to users, such as, “Do you want 
gears on your bicycle?” They will most likely say yes no matter 
what they think. Ask open-ended questions instead, such as, 
“What problems do you encounter when pedalling over chan-
ging terrain?” 
• 
Try to get under the skin of the users. Try to find out their cur-
rent and latent needs. Ask them about their typical behavior 
when they use your or related products. 
• 
Do not ask users only product-related questions. Try to find 
out who they are and be open and be ready for long stories 
about their life. Being honestly interested in people and their 
lives will not only help those people to open  up and give you 
better insights, but it will help their stories sometimes become 
the core source of new innovations that you wouldn’t other-
wise think about. 
• 
Do not use fancy equipment such as recorders and video cam-
eras unless you already have agreed on this with the users. 
Also, keep in mind that what people say to a camera or a re-
corder will be very biased compared to what they will say in a 
casual conversation. When you finish the interview, you can 
ask if you can take a single photo of the person you inter-
viewed. This photo will be very useful for you later when 
documenting the user needs for that specific person. 
Be open, be honest, and be humble. Avoid being perceived as confrontational. 
It’s so easy for an interview to go off the rails, as depicted in Figure 4-9. Open-ended 
questions, willingness to listen, and genuine interest go a long way toward avoiding 
interview failure.

Documenting User Needs 
Filtering data from a large amount of user interviews may take some time, unless 
you use the easy (but still relevant) method of asking only very few users. When you 
have found the core needs of your target users, you need to document these needs 
for the user experience innovation. 
You can record your findings by showing the user needs expressed as specific 
statements from the persons that you interviewed—with the photo of the person in 
the middle. Figure 4-10 shows an example, listing needs of a mobile phone intended 
for low-income consumers in emerging markets. 
If you have very extensive user data and want to compress it, you may need to 
invent a typical person for your user need statements. However, you should have a 
professional researcher do this to avoid too much personal bias.

Summary 
This chapter has provided you with tangible methods to find the user needs for your 
target users. The user needs of your target users are the base for all successful user 
experience innovation.

Identifying Core Tasks 
The last chapter gave you methods to find user needs. User needs are in some cases 
directly useful for user experience innovation. Usually though, you first of all want 
to find out what the user would like to achieve with your product. What are the tasks 
that the user is already achieving or desires to achieve with your product? Which 
tasks would the user like to use your product for in the future? These are key ques-
tions to answer. Identifying current and future potential core tasks for your product 
makes it much easier for you to identify which applications or features you will need 
to focus on in the product development.  
Core task is often mistakenly used as a synonym for application or feature, but 
the terms mean different things. A core task is something that the user wants to 
achieve. A core task is hence purely focused around the user. 
Feature and application are terms invented by designers and engineers to de-
scribe a piece of software or hardware. A feature or application may—or may not—
help the user to achieve her core task. Sometimes solving a core task will require two 
or more applications, and the user may use the same features or applications to 
solve several different core tasks.  
If the user of a mobile phone wants to solve the core task of calling a friend, he 
may use several applications. For example, he may use the contacts list, the call-
handling application, and the volume control application. If the user wants to solve 
the core task of answering a call, he may use several of the same applications as 
when making a call. 
By identifying your target users’ core tasks, you may not only identify that you 
are missing a number of features and applications, but you may also be able to iden-
tify which areas of your current product you need to focus your innovation around. 
Finally, you can also use your core tasks for identifying and innovating around pain 
points. 
Characteristics of a Core Task 
My definition of a core task is a task that a large number of end users would expect 
to be able to perform with a specific device, web page, or system. 
A core task hence does not have to be a task that your users are already per-
forming in your product. A core task can be a task that your users would like to per-
form, but where no solutions—or at least no adequate solutions—are yet available. 
A core task is hence any task that users expect to be able to perform with your pro-
duct. It is important to emphasize that core tasks are defined by the users.  

Identifying Core Tasks 
 
44 
Here are some examples of wrong-headed thinking: 
• 
When a company chooses to put stock information on its front 
page, it is in most cases not because a large number of users 
see viewing that information as a core task. It is more likely be-
cause the management sees it as the most important informa-
tion to push to the users. 
• 
When a web page initially wants to ask users 10 to 20 questions 
before proceeding to the actual content, it is most likely not 
because the users think it is essential. 
• 
When a mobile device manufacturer chooses to force users to 
sign up for an account with its application store before even 
being able to make a phone call, it is not because the users see 
creating an account as a core task. It is more likely because the 
manufacturer wants to boost the amount of registered users 
on their application store. 
However, when you choose to push irrelevant information and force users 
through tasks that they feel have no value, you will lose visitors to your web page, you 
will lose customers on your Internet store, you will get unsatisfied customers for your 
devices, and you will negatively impact the brand of your company.  
Core Tasks Vary by Product 
Core tasks are defined as the most desired functionalities of your web page, device, 
or system—in other words, the tasks that the end users would like to use in your 
product.  
The core tasks will hence vary for different types of products, and here are few ex-
amples: 
• 
A car key, such as in Figure 5-1, performs three core tasks: un-
locking the doors, locking the doors, and starting the engine. 
 
Figure 5-1. Car key 
• 
For a TV remote control, you would probably see functions like 
powering on, powering off, and channel changing as core tasks. 
Also, adjusting volume and muting the TV would fall under core 
tasks. (Initial setting up of the TV channels is also a core task, 
even though it may be performed only one time). 

User Experience Innovation 
 
45 
• 
For a social community web page, core tasks may be changing 
your own status, seeing the status of your friends, inviting 
friends to events, sharing photos, and viewing photos. 
Core Tasks Are Not Solutions 
Core tasks are not solutions, features, or applications. They are tasks that the end 
user has a wish to accomplish. A core task is hence never a button, a menu, a touch 
screen, a Bluetooth chip, or a specific interaction flow. These things are merely solu-
tions to help the user in solving a core task. 
In the case of the remote control, you would hence not define the volume keys 
as a core task. The keys are nothing more than your specific solution to allow the 
users to accomplish core tasks (adjusting the volume, muting, etc.).  
By seeing core tasks as what they are—tasks—you will realize how much inno-
vation can be made around them. 
Core Tasks Differ for Different Groups 
Core tasks may vary depending on the individual user, or at least for different groups 
of target users. So for every new group of users that you choose to target, you will need 
to identify the core tasks again. And for every new target user group you will hence 
also need to look for new user experience innovations that are relevant to these users. 
Core Tasks Link Back to User Needs 
User needs often indirectly link back to the fundamental needs of human beings 
(food, safety, health, etc.), and hence these needs change slowly over time. User 
needs for a specific product are often defined as concrete wishes or desires, such 
as, “I need the product to provide safety for my family.” The underlying fundamen-
tal human need (in this case, safety) is often quite visible, even when applied to 
specific products. 
Core tasks also link back to the fundamental human needs, but core tasks will 
change when new technologies or applications are added to a product and when 
the users have learned the new skills required to master the new technology or  
application. 
What Makes a Task Evolve into a Core Task? 
Core tasks change more rapidly than user needs, since core tasks will change when 
new skills are learned by the user. Until around 1995, the core tasks of most mobile 
phones were making calls and receiving calls. After 1995, sending and receiving 
messages became core tasks for an increasing number of users. Despite the fact that 
the first mobile phones with Internet access and e-mail support were launched in 
the mid-1990s, browsing the Internet and writing/receiving e-mails did not become 
core tasks until much later (2005 or later). 

Identifying Core Tasks

Anecdote 
The ability to send and receive texts on Global System for Mobile Communications 
(GSM) mobile phones was there almost from the very beginning, which means 
around 1990; it was part of the first GSM standards. Many devices supported this 
from the beginning of the 1990s, but almost no one in the industry saw any potential 
in this ability. Who would use a small keypad that was never designed for text writ-
ing to send messages (and that had room for only 160 characters)?  
The operators had to invest in expensive SMS service centers, so they deliberately 
charged SMS sending accordingly. Initial cost for sending a single SMS message 
was up to $1. 
According to Wikipedia,1 SMS usage was around 0.4 messages sent per customer 
per month in 1995. Around 1998, a Norwegian GSM operator performed an experi-
ment and made SMS sending free of charge for its customers. A few hours later, the 
SMS service centers handling the messages crashed due to overload.  
This was a wake-up call for the entire mobile industry. Message sending was sud-
denly on everyone’s lips and everybody realized that an important core task for mo-
bile phone users had been overlooked for many years. 
At Nokia, we immediately gathered a small team, with me as one of the lead de-
signers. The target was to introduce T9 (predictive text input2) to a product that was 
almost ready to be launched. With a very tight schedule and impatient software de-
velopers and product managers breathing down our necks, we managed to intro-
duce the first T9-enabled mobile phone in 1999—the very successful Nokia 3210.3
See Figure 5-2 for an example of T9 input in action. 
Figure 5-2. T9 text input 
Today, a large number of mobile phone users see sending and receiving e-
mails, browsing the Internet, playing games, taking photos, and GPS navigation as

core tasks of a mobile phone. What actually made these tasks become core tasks for 
the mobile phone users? Was there no need to access the Internet from your mobile 
phone back in 1995? Did people not have a need to use their mobile phone for cap-
turing photos?  
Part of the answer is that Internet access technologies, text-writing methods, 
camera units, and so on were neither mature nor cheap enough to be included on a 
mobile phone. Also, operator billing schemes and low Internet speed was a factor in 
the slow uptake.  
But in my opinion, the main reason was that the user experience for these tech-
nologies was not made good enough until around 2005. User experience in this case 
includes interaction methods, screen resolutions, acceptable camera quality, fast 
Internet connections, and also acceptable operator billing plans. 
Today many customers believe that the first mobile phone with Internet access 
and a browser was the iPhone, even though it came more than ten years after the 
first Internet-enabled mobile phones. 
If you want a big impact for your product in the market, then you need to focus 
your innovation primarily on the core tasks that the users will perform on your sys-
tem, device, or web page.  
If you want to change an entire industry, you will want to identify potential and 
future core tasks of your product and then create a superb user experience for these 
core tasks in your product. 
Time-Critical Core Tasks 
Some core tasks have a different nature since they may be time critical. If, for exam-
ple, your telephone starts ringing while you’re watching TV, muting the TV will in 
this situation be a time-critical core task. And you may want to come up with an 
innovation such as shaking the remote control to quickly mute the TV. 
Finding your mobile phone when a call is coming in is another example of a 
time-critical core task. When your phone rings, you often want to answer it  before 
you miss the call.  
Finding specific information on a company website is yet a third example of a 
time-critical core task, if you want to quickly look up specific data. The fact that 
many company websites do not support good solutions for this core task is one of 
the reasons for the success of Internet search engines, which can get you directly to 
the content you need on a company website, without your having to go through the 
maybe unintuitive front page of this company’s website. 
To some extent you may want to see all core tasks as time critical. With a few 
exceptions (such as game playing), users do not want to use excessive time complet-
ing a task. They want to complete most tasks as quickly as possible—and without 
problems. If a product competing with your product gets the core tasks done faster 
and more easily, then you may have a problem. 
However, highly time-critical core tasks often need different solutions than other 
core tasks. In many cases, simple, intuitive, and fast solutions may be preferable.  

Identifying Core Tasks 
 
48 
Potential Future Core Tasks 
Remember that some core tasks may not yet have been learned by the users. The 
users may already have the underlying need to perform a task with your product, 
but you or the entire industry may not yet have provided solutions that are good 
enough for the users to learn the new task. Such tasks represent possibilities for  
innovation.  
Alternatively, you may as a company simply not be aware that an underlying 
need exists. The SMS anecdote earlier in this chapter is an example of such a case. 
Again, such needs are possibilities for innovation and profit.  
Why Innovate Around Core Tasks? 
Creating user experience innovation around your core tasks is essential for a web 
page, a device, or any other system. First of all, your core tasks are the tasks on which 
your users spend most of their time with your product, so this is an excellent place to 
give the users a little wow or provide them with a nice experience. Secondly, because 
your users spend most of their time and focus on the core tasks, they represent natu-
ral—and for the users, expected—areas in which to keep improving and innovating. 
Users will over time increase their expectations in exactly these areas. 
By knowing your users’ core tasks, you will also find it easier to prioritize im-
provements and resource spending in the future. You can focus resources primarily 
on core tasks and new innovations instead of fixing problems in areas that the cus-
tomers never use. 
Method for Identifying Core Tasks 
This section describes a stepwise approach to identifying both the current and fu-
ture potential core tasks of your product. In overview, the steps are as follows: 
Step 1: Identify or Define Your Target Users 
Step 2: Identify the User Needs of the Target Users 
Step 3: Identify the Core Tasks of Your Product 
Step 4: Identify Potential Future Core Tasks 
Step 5: Document Your Preliminary Core Tasks 
Step 6: Verify and Prioritize Your Core Tasks 
Step 7: Identify the Top Core Tasks for Your Product 
Step 8: Process and Document the Results 
 

User Experience Innovation

Step 1: Identify or Define Your Target Users 
Since core tasks will change with user needs, which again will change with the target 
users you are approaching, identifying—or defining—your target users is the first 
essential step. Throughout this chapter, I will as an example use a music-playing 
device targeted for teenagers in developed markets (see Figure 5-3). 
 
Figure 5-3. Target users in the example: teenagers in developed markets 
Step 2: Identify the User Needs of the Target Users 
You can use the methods described in the previous chapter to identify the user 
needs for the target users. For the music player example, we will assume that you 
have already identified the user needs of the teenagers in developed markets. Figure 
5-4 shows a list of the user needs for teenagers in developed markets. The list is de-
liberately made incomplete to keep the example simple. 
As the figure indicates, you do not want to limit the user needs to those specifi-
cally relevant to your current product or assumed product, and you certainly want 
to list needs that the users currently use other products or means to achieve. Several 
of these latent user needs can perhaps be achieved with the product you are design-
ing, and you will hence have a unique chance to create the first product of its kind 
that solves these needs. You will in other words get almost direct inputs to ideas 
about where you can improve your product in the future and where you can add 
successful user experience innovation.

Step 3: Identify the Core Tasks of Your Product 
If you already have a similar product on the market for similar target users, you may 
be tempted to identify your current core tasks by asking your existing users what 
tasks they already perform. You could hold a meeting, such as in Figure 5-4. 
If your product is a web page or a software application, you can run statistics on 
which tasks the users are performing with your product. These can give you infor-
mation about which tasks are currently core for the current users. 
 
Figure 5-5. Identifying core tasks 

User Experience Innovation 
 
51 
However, since core tasks are defined as tasks that the user expects to use your 
product for, your interviews and statistics will be skewed by how well you have de-
signed the features or applications for your core tasks. If you have, for example, de-
signed your calendar application for your web page very poorly or hidden it under 
some difficult-to-understand drop-down menu, your feedback and data may not 
highlight tasks such as creating appointments as core. Also, statistical data will also 
reveal tasks that you have not implemented yet.  
Also, which is often the case, you may be targeting a different group of users 
with your new product. Hence your statistics and user interviews will be obsolete. 
In some cases you may also look at your pain points. Pain points can, for exam-
ple, be identified by going through e-mails or call logs from your customer service. 
Not only are pain points great tools for innovating user experience improvements 
(as described in Chapter 9), but they may also reveal the tasks that users are per-
forming (or expecting to perform) a lot in your product. 
While statistical data and pain points may sometimes be useful to identify exist-
ing core tasks, you will always want to back up your core task identification with the 
approach described following. Certain market research agencies will also be able to 
provide you with an approach similar to the one I describe. My approach, however, 
may be lower key and hence maybe easier to take. 
Gathering a Group of Cross-Functional Team Members and 
Lead Users 
The first thing you want to do is to invite cross-functional team members for a short 
innovation session. You want to invite team members from different parts of the 
company, especially those who specialize in user experience design and consumer 
insights. Who to invite from your company depends on the size and structure of 
your organization, as well as the type of product you are designing. 
You should also ideally invite real users. Discovering core tasks by analyzing 
user needs will surely require interviewing actual users.  
Process for Identifying Core Tasks for Your Product 
My suggestion for this approach is to use a simple drawing (e.g., on a white board) 
where you place a photo of a representative target user—or multiple photos of tar-
get users—in the center, and then place the user needs around the user, basically as 
suggested already in Figure 5-5 for the music player example. You can use this draw-
ing with the team of people you have gathered and start imagining which user tasks 
may be core tasks for your product. 
Identifying core tasks for elements that you already have solutions for in your 
existing products is usually quite straightforward, since you know your products 
and can easily relate to these tasks. But a core purpose of this workshop is to also 
identify core tasks that are currently not covered by your product. These are the so-
called future potential core tasks. 
Again, you want to keep the type of product you are designing in mind, but do 
not be too restrictive. You need to try to imagine what kind of tasks the type of pro-

Identifying Core Tasks 
 
52 
duct you are designing may likely be used for in the future. It is essential to be inno-
vative in this process; it’s fine to come up with wild ideas for core tasks, since you 
will need to verify your core tasks with the target users later anyway. 
You may also look at related products to get inspiration. If you are designing a 
music player, you might, for example, look at what is happening in the market for 
other handheld devices, such as mobile phones, navigation devices, portable game 
devices, and so on. 
The result of the workshop could, for example, be as displayed as in Figure 5-6, 
which shows the results for the music player example.  
 
Figure 5-6. Example of results from finding core tasks from user needs 
Step 4: Identify Potential Future Core Tasks 
You may have market research or other insights indicating a rising interest for solu-
tions that your product is already offering, or that your product could offer in future. 
These tasks are hence not core tasks yet, but they may well become core tasks in  
the future.  
Identifying potential future core tasks is extremely important, since there are 
many possibilities for successful user experience innovation if your product can 
provide solutions for these latent user needs before your competition will do it. For 
finding potential future core tasks, you need to identify latent or already existing 
user needs among your target users. 
If you are designer of a company website, you will try to find out what informa-
tion and applications are missing on your website. You want to look for ideas from 
customer feedback. You will check what competing companies offer on their web-

User Experience Innovation 
 
53 
sites. And you will want to interview customers about what they are missing and 
about their latent needs. 
If you are designing a device, you will look at competitor devices to see if they 
offer solutions for core tasks that you have sparsely covered.  
You may also want to look at devices or systems not directly competing with 
your device, but where you can find inspiration. If you design mobile phones, for 
example, it will be obvious to look at what core tasks are solved in the PC or tablet 
world. These core tasks may evolve into core tasks for mobile devices later.  
If you are designing a word processor or some other piece of software, you will 
look for competition and try to dig out relevant core tasks from them. Or you will 
invite or ask lead users (as described in Chapter 13). But the key goal is to find un-
solved target user needs and hence potential core tasks that apply to your product.  
In the example with the music player for teenagers, you may have found poten-
tial future core tasks already from the exercise described previously. Maybe you de-
ducted some core tasks from latent end-user needs—for example, the task of play-
ing games with friends on your device or sending text messages. 
By looking at potential future core tasks you will have a unique opportunity to 
provide great user experience innovations. If you design your solutions very well, 
your company may even end up later being seen as the inventor of the specific  
solutions. 
Potential future core tasks, however, have some inherent challenges also. Try to 
avoid focusing on solutions for these potential core tasks so much that you end up 
reducing the user experience of the already existing core tasks. 
Step 5: Document Your Preliminary Core Tasks 
You can now document the imagined and hence assumed core tasks that you have 
identified for the product you are designing. One way is to place each of the user 
needs in the center of a page and show the identified core tasks around it. Figure 5-7 
shows this approach for a single user need from the music player example: “I love to 
hang out with my friends.”  
 

Identifying Core Tasks 
 
54 
 
Figure 5-7. Method to show core tasks for a specific user need (music player example) 
Step 6: Verify and Prioritize Your Core Tasks 
Verifying your core tasks with target users is essential. Maybe you have misunder-
stood a user need. If the target users for the mobile phone you are designing have a 
need to protect their family, it may likely be a mistake to assume that you should 
build a full-blown camera surveillance system into your device. Maybe your users 
would never want to use your specific product to solve that need. 
 Note  If you invited users to your previous workshop, your core tasks may already be 
somewhat verified. 
As another example, if you have a spreadsheet product, your product’s users 
will likely also have needs to write documents. This does not, however, mean that 
you should integrate a word processor into your spreadsheet program, since the 
users may already have adequate means to solve this task.  
Maybe you have overlooked an important user need, and this may also be re-
vealed when verifying and prioritizing your core tasks with the users. 
When verifying your core tasks, it is essential that you have the target users’ pri-
oritize the core tasks. And it is important that the target users have your type of pro-
duct in mind for the prioritization. In this way, you will filter out core tasks that are 
relevant for the user, but for which there are sufficient solutions in other products (or 
that users would never see themselves performing on your type of device). For ex-

User Experience Innovation 
 
55 
ample, if you are designing a car key, and you have identified that writing text mes-
sages is a core task for your target users, you would hardly want to add that function-
ality to your key. 
You can verify the core tasks by interviewing a number of target users face to 
face, or via phone or e-mail. You may also invite multiple target users into your of-
fice and let them prioritize in a team.  
Make use of simple but effective methods to help users keep track of the big 
picture. For example, you can  print each of your core tasks on separate pieces of 
paper and let the user arrange them in priority order, or place them in different 
categories, such as Very Important, Important, Less Important, and so on. Be sure to 
allow the users to discard core tasks and add new ones as well. 
For the music player example, the result of the prioritization could be like that 
shown in Figure 5-8. 
 
Figure 5-8. Prioritization of core tasks (music player example) 
Step 7: Identify the Top Core Tasks for Your Product 
If you are designing a new device, web page, or system, or you are designing a pro-
duct for new target users, you will want to end up with a list of the most important 
core tasks. This is essential to ensure that the design of your product and your user 
experience innovations get focused. 
If you instead already have a product that you need to find new user experience 
innovations for, you may want to focus your innovations on the most important 
core tasks, but you may also want to look at lower-priority core tasks for potential 
user experience innovation. 

Identifying Core Tasks 
56 
Step 8: Process and Document the Results  
You now have a list of verified and prioritized core tasks for your product, and you 
may also have found a number of potential future core tasks. You can now docu-
ment your core tasks in preparation for using them to drive innovation, as described 
in the next chapter. Consider including photos or drawings of each core task, to-
gether with some descriptive text. You can often find images of a specific situation 
from the Internet. 
Summary 
Identifying core tasks for your product will help you in identifying potential user 
experience innovations for a product that you are designing for new target users. 
Identifying core tasks is also essential for innovating user experience solutions for 
an existing product. Several of the following chapters will use core tasks—either 
directly or indirectly—as input into different methods for creating successful user 
experiences.

Innovating Around 
Core Tasks 
Many companies tend to spread their innovation across everything. You may stum-
ble over web pages where seldom-used functions have been shined up radically, but 
where the basic navigation still lacks a lot. You may find devices (e.g., mobile 
phones) where small and irrelevant functions have been updated visually and user 
interactions have been improved, but where core functions (e.g., adding a contact to 
the contact list) still remain troublesome and old-fashioned. You may find web 
pages where the graphical experience has been improved radically, but where per-
forming a task has not changed a bit.  
These are examples of wrong focus on user experience innovation, and they 
show how focus is essential when creating successful user experience innovation. If 
you create a great innovation in a small and rarely used application of your product, 
then it will most likely not contribute to the overall success of your product. 
The mistake in the previous situations is often that the core tasks of the product 
haven’t been identified. Or they have been defined with, for example, a marketing or 
branding focus rather than a user focus. 
The remainder of this chapter will describe a concrete approach to innovating 
potentially successful innovations that solve the core tasks in new ways. The ap-
proach consists of these six steps: 
1. 
Identify target users, user needs, and core tasks. 
2. 
Identify potential future core tasks. 
3.

Throughout the chapter, I will use a concrete example to explain the methods. 
In this chapter I have chosen to use a low-cost mobile phone, with a traditional key-
pad and a small black-and-white display. Figure 6-1 shows this phone.

Step 1: Identify Target Users, User Needs, and  
Core Tasks 
In this chapter I will assume that you have already defined your target users, found 
their needs, and identified the core tasks, as described in the previous chapters. The 
target users for our example device are small business owners in low-income mar-
kets. Depending on the complexity of the product you have, there may be one, two, 
or many core tasks. In our specific example of a low-cost mobile device, the core 
tasks shown in Figure 6-2 have been identified.

Figure 6-2. Example of core tasks for low-cost mobile device 
Step 2: Identify Potential Future Core Tasks 
Identifying future potential core tasks is extremely important. That knowledge 
helps you innovate new user experience solutions to cover latent or existing user 
needs. In the example with the low-cost mobile phone, let us assume that the com-
pany has identified the needs shown in Figure 6-3 that are currently not solved by 
the mobile device. 
By looking at potential future core tasks you will have a unique opportunity to 
provide great user experience innovations. If you design your solutions very well, 
your company may even end up later being seen as the inventor of the specific 
solutions. 
Potential future core tasks, however, have some inherent challenges also. For 
example, you might focus on solutions for potential core tasks so much that you end 
up reducing the user experience for the core tasks. To avoid this pitfall, you should 
try to treat existing core tasks and future core tasks equally when innovating. 
 

Innovating Around Core Tasks 
 
60 
 
Figure 6-3. Potential future core tasks in the low-cost mobile device example 
Step 3: List Current Solutions for the Core Tasks 
When you have a complete list of core tasks for your device, system, or web page, 
you need to identify and evaluate the current solutions you offer for each. You can 
do this by creating a simple list with all the solutions that you already provide for 
each of the identified core tasks (e.g., on a whiteboard or similar).  
Figure 6-4 shows the current solutions for a few of the core tasks identified for 
the low-cost mobile device.  
You may have core tasks for which your product does not yet provide solutions. 
Retain those core tasks on the list. If you can find solutions for these core tasks, you 
might be able to easily create a successful innovation. For other core tasks, there 
may not yet be any suitable solutions available—but they may become feasible 
someday. Referring to your list of unsolved core tasks from time to time will keep 
you in a frame of mind to spot new possibilities as they arise.  
 

User Experience Innovation 
 
61 
 
Figure 6-4. Listing current solutions for a few of the mobile device core tasks 
Step 4: Evaluate the Current Solutions for the  
Core Tasks  
When you have identified the current solutions for the core tasks, you then need to 
evaluate if the current solutions are adequate and sufficient. Even for core tasks 
where you have sufficient solutions, you will still want to create user experience  
innovations for these. You should never stop innovating around your core tasks, 
since you will want to constantly keep your solutions for the core tasks ahead of the 
competition. 
There are several ways to evaluate your current solutions. You can run usability 
tests for the solutions to find pain points and areas needing improvement; you can 
have a user experience expert teardown made; and you can use market research and 
info from actual consumer feedback, via interviews or mail surveys.  
Another way to evaluate the current solutions is to arrange a small meeting to 
discuss the current solutions specifically. You will again want a small but multidis-
ciplinary group to do this. And you should invite consumer feedback experts as well 
as real users. Go through each of the core tasks and discuss how well the current 
solutions allow the users to solve these tasks.  
You may want to start your user experience innovation for the core tasks where 
you find the most serious problems, and for the most important core tasks. But 
eventually you should go through all the core tasks. 

Innovating Around Core Tasks 
 
62 
Step 5: Innovate Solutions 
No matter the current status of your solutions, the next step is to prepare each of the 
core tasks for innovation. 
One method is reusing the list or drawing that you already created with the core 
tasks and their current solutions. You can quickly copy this drawing to a whiteboard, 
and you can then begin innovating. You can now invite a multidisciplinary team of 
innovative people to a session. As always, you may also want to invite real users—for 
example, a few lead users (as described further in Chapter 13). 
The goal of the innovation session is to create new ideas or improvements to 
how the users can accomplish their core tasks. In the low-cost mobile phone exam-
ple, let us assume that the creative session resulted in the new solutions shown in 
Figure 6-5.  
 
Figure 6-5. Examples of innovating solutions and improvements for core tasks 
Step 6: Document the Results and Process the 
Output 
How you choose to document the results and innovations is up to you. Figure 6-6 
shows one example of how to document the results.  
Eventually you’ll want to start designing, creating drawings and wireframes, 
and so on, but first you need to verify your solutions with the users. You can, for 
example, verify solutions through usability tests and interviews. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
63 
You may also want to prioritize your solutions based on resources and time 
needed, but also on how crucial the core task is and on how often the user will need to 
perform this core task. You may, for example, want to give higher priority to im-
provements to core tasks that the user will perform every day or several times a day.  
Also consider first impressions. If you are, for example, designing a website on 
which a core task is performed on the very front page, you should give high priority 
to improving this core task.

Summary 
In this chapter I have shown you a concrete and straightforward way to create user 
experience innovations based on the core tasks of your device, web page, or system, 
and I have given you guidance on how to make these innovations successful.

Innovating for New  
Technologies 
Technologies themselves never, or at least very rarely, can make your product a suc-
cess. To make your new technology a success, you have to provide value to the users 
from day one.  
Anecdote 
Infrared connection was available in early mobile phones, and it was mainly in-
tended to connect your computer—via a very expensive and slow connection—to 
the Internet. Few cared, or were willing to pay, but the technology was there. 
Nokia designed a two-player game named Snake (see Figure 7-1) using the infrared 
connection between two phones. That novel usage garnered much attention from 
the media. Many users tried and enjoyed the game. The logical conclusion is that 
new technologies will only become successful user experience innovations if and 
when the end users see a real value. In the case of Snake, the value was social en-
tertainment, which at that time had never been seen on a mobile phone.

Selecting Technologies 
Many technologies are added to devices, systems, or web pages for the wrong rea-
sons. It can be because competitors use these technologies, it can be because the 
technology comes free with a chip-set’s software package, or it can be because peo-
ple in management decided to add the technology for some reason. 
In my opinion, technologies should only be added or used if they can solve true 
end-user needs, be they needs for improved security, for greater interaction possi-
bilities, or for any other user experience improvement. 
If a specific technology does not improve the user experience or solve any ex-
isting or latent user needs, then adding the technology to your product will in the 
best case add extra costs to your product, and in the worst case degrade the user 
experience. 
Technologies As Sources for User Experience 
Innovation 
Technologies can, however, if added and designed in the correct way, be a truly 
great source for successful user experience innovation. Look at how multitouch dis-
play technology basically revolutionized the smart phone market. No, the technol-
ogy itself did not revolutionize the smart phone market; the great and relevant user 
experience innovations created on top of this technology did.  
In a similar way, the TV business went through a tremendous change during the 
2000s due to the plasma, LCD, and LED technologies. This happened because the 
technologies were used to give clear benefits for the user experience: better-quality 
and larger-screened (yet lighter) TVs at a reasonable price. 
For web pages, new HTML formats, Java capabilities, CSS support, and more 
can in similar ways be used to revolutionize the market, or at least your product. 
The key is to design with and use these features in ways that bring true value to the 
end user. 
Keeping an eye on technologies and creating innovation around technologies is 
an absolute core method for successful user experience innovation. Many success-
ful products in the world have taken existing or relatively new technologies and cre-
ated a superb user experience around them. 
Creating User Experience Innovation Around 
Technologies 
One very practical and straightforward method to creating new ideas for a new (or 
old) technology is to draw the technology in the middle of a diagram (e.g., on a 
whiteboard), and then list potential or concrete customer needs around the tech-
nology. This method consists of five steps: 

User Experience Innovation 
 
67 
1. 
Identify target user needs. 
2. 
Identify potential capabilities of the new technology. 
3. 
Put the technology in the center. 
4. 
Innovate solutions based on customer needs and technol-
ogy capabilities. 
5. 
Document the results and process the output. 
Throughout this chapter I will use a specific example: a mobile device manu-
facturer that is planning to add an infrared camera to one of its devices. The main 
driver for the company is enabling users to take funny photos of people in dark 
rooms. 
Step 1: Identify Target User Needs 
The first thing you want to do as a designer and innovator is identify the needs of 
your target consumers. In the case of the infrared camera, your company has al-
ready defined family providers (Figure 7-2) in mature markets as the target users. 
The core user needs are identified as these: 
• 
The target users like to share photos with friends and family. 
• 
Target users like to be creative. 
• 
Security and safety is important for the target users—for them-
selves and their families. 
• 
Target users like to have fun and play games, maybe with their 
families. 
• 
Price and economy is important for the target users. 
• 
Health is important. 
You can diagram these needs, and their related potentials, as shown in Figure 
7-3. I use the term potentials to refer to specific uses to which users can put a device 
that meets the listed needs. For example, health needs suggest the potential for 
using the infrared camera to look for medical symptoms, perhaps to measure body 
temperature. 
How you choose to document the core needs is up to you, but I suggest using a 
whiteboard, since later you may want to invite more people to brainstorm ideas 
based on your initial framework. But if you prefer mind-mapping software or other 
media, this may also work fine. Just make sure that the tool does not become an 
obstacle to the actual innovation process. Innovating in a team around a single 
computer is often not optimal.

Step 2: Identify Potential Capabilities of the New 
Technology 
The next thing you may want to do is to search the Internet or literature to find out 
what your technology can be used for. List both the obvious and not-so-obvious 
potential capabilities. 
Sometimes a technology—with a small twist—can be changed to be used for 
completely different purposes than intended, and this can expand the use cases for 
the technology. And it may give you an idea that can give you a successful user ex-
perience innovation. 
In the case of the device with an infrared camera, you may find out that such 
cameras have the potential capabilities shown in Figure 7-4. 
 
Figure 7-4. Technology capabilities of the infrared camera 
Not all of these capabilities may feel directly relevant in the beginning, but try 
to make a complete list nevertheless. Sometimes looking at a technology and its 
potentials from a completely different angle may bring up truly new and potentially 
successful innovations for your specific product. 
You can then list the potential capabilities of your technology as shown in Fig-
ure 7-5. 
 

Innovating for New Technologies 
 
70 
 
Figure 7-5. Potential capabilities listed next to the needs of the target consumer  
Step 3: Put the Technology in the Center 
The next thing you want to do is to place your technology in the center of the dia-
gram. You are then basically ready to start innovating potentially successful user 
experience innovation. 
In the case of the infrared camera, your drawing may now look like that shown 
in Figure 7-6. 
 

User Experience Innovation 
 
71 
 
Figure 7-6. Innovating around a central technology 
Step 4: Innovate Solutions Based on Customer Needs 
and Technology Capabilities 
You are now basically ready to start your idea creation for your technology. As with 
all creativity, more brains work better, and people from different disciplines may 
come up with very different ideas. So make sure to invite enough—but not too 
many—people to your idea creation session. You may even want to invite real users, 
as described in Chapter 13. Using a large whiteboard is usually best, and it allows 
multiple participants to write on the board at the same time. You may also use 
sticky notes, allowing users who don’t like to stand in front of a whiteboard to sit at 
their desk and write down ideas to be put on the whiteboard.  
Creative sessions should not have too many rules or limitations, so choose the 
method that fits your team and situation best, and allow for ongoing changes to the 
method. You may also need to add new technology capabilities if some participants 
are aware of other potential uses of your technology. However, the goal is to focus 
on the connections between your technology and the target user needs. In other 
words, the focus is on connections in the figure. Also, new needs may be added dur-
ing the process, if participants are aware of target customer needs that you over-
looked when planning your creative session. 
The connections between user needs and the technology will be the key focus 
of the idea creation. In the case of the infrared camera, the result could look like 
Figure 7-7 after just a few minutes of idea creation. 
 

Innovating for New Technologies 
 
72 
 
Figure 7-7. Example of result of innovation around the infrared camera 
Step 5: Document the Results and Process the Output 
The results of your efforts will be a huge list of big and small ideas. You can choose to 
merge or split ideas, or massage them further—as a part of the innovation session or 
afterward. You can also verify those results, as described later in Chapter 18.  
Your ideas will most likely fit the customer needs quite well, since this method 
is based around the target users’ core needs; but you should of course verify the 
ideas later on with customers. You can verify solutions through market research, 
through simple interviews where you present your ideas to potential target custom-
ers, and later through usability testing and other common methods.  
In the case of adding an infrared camera to a device, the resulting list from your 
creative session may be something like that shown Figure 7-8. You will want to keep 
the end-user needs as the headings for the resulting ideas list, since it is very im-
portant to remember—especially later in the design and verification process—why 
these ideas came up and why they might bring value to your customers. There will 
also be ideas that do not cover an identified end-user need. These should also be 
documented. You may be able to twist them to apply to an end-user need, or fit 
them into a future product designed for a different target group.

Using Core Tasks or Pain Points as an Alternative 
Approach 
In this chapter I chose to use the target users for the user experience innovation, but 
you may also try this same exercise using core tasks or pain points around the tech-
nology. You may get a few other ideas when approaching this exercise in other ways. 
Summary 
When adding a new technology to a device, web page, or system, many companies 
tend to focus on the already known and planned use cases for that application. If 
the competition already has products on the market covering the core uses of the 

Innovating for New Technologies 
 
74 
technology, then you will have little chance of making a real difference to the 
users—or in the market.  
The method described in this chapter ensures two things: 
• 
It ensures that you will have already found and studied other  
potential uses of the technology that is being applied to a product  
• 
It ensures that the customers’ needs are the focal point of your 
innovation process, hence making it much more probable that 
your solutions will actually give value to the end users. 
The next chapter will give ideas on how to create user experience innovation 
aroundapplications, applications. 
 
  

C H A P T E R

Innovating for  
Applications 
When adding a new application to your web page, device, or system, you will often 
focus primarily on the core use cases of this application. If you, for example, add a 
calendar to a web page or a device, you will usually focus mainly on the presentation, 
on creating easy methods to add reminders, on alarm handling, and so on. 
However, there is huge potential if you also start looking at how your new ap-
plication can interact with other applications and parts of your product. Looking at 
these interactions can help you find user experience innovations in the links be-
tween applications.  
By innovating in the links between applications, you can provide users a seam-
less experience, and this can truly distinguish your product in the market. Many 
brilliant web pages, devices, and systems are unique not because of the actual de-
sign of the standalone applications they have, but because of the seamless integra-
tion of multiple applications, which gives the entire product or set of products a 
great and powerful user experience. 
In this chapter I describe a five-step process that I have used many times with 
success. The process helps you examine links between applications with the goal of 
providing a seamless and delightful user experience. The five steps for this method 
are as follows: 
1. 
Identify target user needs. 
2. 
Identify applications to interact with. 
3. 
 Create a diagram with your application in the center. 
4. 
Innovate solutions. 
5. 
Document the results and process the output. 
In this chapter I will again use a concrete example to describe the method. We 
will consider a social community web page. Our scenario will be that we want to add 
an events calendar to that web page.  

Innovating for Applications 
76 
Step 1: Identify Target User Needs 
The first thing you want to do is identify the target user needs for your web 
page, device, or system. You can do that based on market research, interviews with 
users, hotline feedback, and so on. For our example involving a calendar for a social 
web page, the target user needs shown in Figure 8-1 were identified. 
Figure 8-1. Target user needs identified for the social community web page example 
Step 2: Identify Applications to Interact With 
The first thing to do is identify any potential applications that the new application 
could interact with. If you’re designing for a web page or mobile device, you might 
want to include applications, technologies, and services from other web pages or 
mobile devices as well. 
Again, I suggest using a whiteboard for the method I describe in this chapter. 
Write down your target user needs from Figure 8-1. Then build a circle of applica-
tions that the web page already offers, as in Figure 8-2. 
In this example, I’m assuming that the web page already supports a friends list, 
photo sharing, status messages, and message handling. I’ve also placed “Other web 
services” in the diagram. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
77 
 
Figure 8-2. Placing other applications in a circle 
Step 3: Create a diagram with your application in 
the center 
The next step is to put the application you want to innovate around in the center, and 
connect it to the other applications available on your device, web page, or system. In 
this example, we will put the calendar in the center, as shown in Figure 8-3. 
 
Figure 8-3. Calendar placed in the middle and connected to the existing applications 

Innovating for Applications 
 
78 
Step 4: Innovate Solutions  
You are now ready to gather a group of people to start your user experience innova-
tion process. You should focus your innovation effort on connections between your 
new application in the center and the other applications. It is in those in-between 
areas that you will find truly novel and potentially successful user experience innova-
tions. But the target user needs are equally important and can be used as inspiration 
in the idea creation process. 
During your innovation process, ideas will surely pop up that relate only to the 
application that you have in focus. You will also likely generate ideas for the other 
applications. It is important to also focus on how the applications may interact with 
others not in the diagram—in our case with other web services outside of our social 
community website. For this example, the result of the idea creation session could 
look like that shown in Figure 8-4. 
 
Figure 8-4. Results of the innovation for the calendar application 
Step 5: Document the Results and Process the 
Output 
You will be surprised at how many ideas you can generate in a very short time using 
this method. The resulting list of ideas of course needs further verification with cus-
tomers, marketing, and so forth. You may also need to create draft design sketches 
for the ideas before verifying the ideas with your users. 
A filtered version of the resulting list may look like Figure 8-5.

Summary 
The method described in this chapter provides a tangible approach to creating user 
experience innovation for and around a specific application. The method works by 
focusing on how the application can become more powerful and valuable by closely 
integrating its functionality with other applications already existing on your device, 
web page, or system. 
Another important part of successful user experience innovation around appli-
cations is looking at the ecosystem. I talk more about ecosystems and how to exam-
ine them in Chapter 12.  
The focus on target customer needs in this chapter ensures a good chance of 
success at innovating in the spaces between applications, and as such a good 
chance of success in the marketplace. The method has proven successful for gener-
ating a large number of ideas relevant to the user, many of which you will find on 
Nokia’s mobile devices today.

Relieving the Pain 
It is surprising how many device manufacturers and professional website com-
panies have little or no idea of their products’ pain points for the users. Every day I 
stumble upon web pages that take tens of seconds or even minutes to simply load 
the Flash intro; and very often those web pages do not even have a skip-intro func-
tion available. In those cases, I do like 90 percent of other users: I leave the web 
page. According to Jakob Nielsen,1 a 10-second delay in web page loading may often 
make users leave the site. 
I frequently unsuccessfully look for essential information on a web page. For ex-
ample, I might look for details about a company’s products. Instead I am presented 
with useless information about the company’s history or how its stocks are doing.  
Currently spending most of my time in many different hotel rooms, I also re-
peatedly find myself trying to figure out how to operate the TV with the remote con-
trol. Usually the problem is that remote controls are plastered with buttons, leaving 
the core functions almost impossible to find. The layout of the keys certainly also 
leaves a lot to wish for. 
As mentioned earlier in this book, it may take ten great user experience ele-
ments to cover up for a single bad user experience element in a product. And if your 
bad user experience is placed where most users tend to navigate, then you have a 
serious problem. 
Benefits 
Focusing your innovation on experiences that are painful for the user is a good in-
vestment and will enhance the overall user experience of your product. Fixing the 
pain points will not only improve end-user satisfaction, but it will almost certainly 
also save you a lot of money that would have been spent replying to e-mails and 
taking calls on hotlines. Fixing pain points may not necessarily give you a product 
with a superb user experience, but it will help you avoid having a product with a 
very bad user experience.  
My experience is that finding the pain points is often not a problem; however, 
rigid organizations, stubbornness in the design department, management, and 
marketing often force these problems to go unfixed. Sometimes problematic soft-
ware architectures and lack of resources tend to be a problem, since fixing a pain 
point may take the same amount of time as designing new functionality that the

marketing department is requesting. Fixing a pain point will typically be prioritized 
below designing new functionality, but in many cases this will be a very bad way to 
prioritize.  
Anecdote 
Sometimes fixing pain points may even generate new ideas that can become selling 
points for your product. In the early days of mobile communication, most phones 
were equipped with very simple contact lists. Although these lists supported names, 
the handling of them was very cumbersome. 
One of the most successful early mobile phones was the Nokia 2110 (shown in Figure 
9-1).  It had a contact list where the user could add a name for phone numbers. Ac-
cessing the list was relatively easy, via a soft key labeled “Memory,” which could be 
accessed from standby mode. However, when pressing this soft key, you would be 
presented with a list of numbers organized according to their more or less random lo-
cations on the SIM card. The names of the contacts were not even visible. 
To allow switching from SIM card–order mode to an alphabetical list of names, the 
2110 was equipped with a dedicated key labeled “abc” (the top right button above 
the keypad in Figure 9-1). Most users would have to read the manual to understand 
what this key did, and few users actually read it. Since research and interviews 
showed that very few users were actually using the alphabetic contact list, the con-
clusion for many people in marketing was that users didn’t actually want an alpha-
betical contact list—an incorrect assumption. 
Luckily, the misguided people in marketing did not get their say. Keen and proactive 
user experience designers at Nokia managed to push through a radically new and 
later very successful redesign of the contacts list. This new design also made the 
abc key superfluous, which—due to the sparse real estate on the device—may 
have contributed to why the new contact list design was approved.

The Method 
The method described in this chapter is a straightforward and simple way to 
find the pain points in your product’s user experience and to create innovations 
that reduce those pain points. The five steps in this method are 
1. 
Identify the current pain points of your product. 
2. 
Find the underlying causes for the pain points. 
3. 
Verify your causes. 
4. 
Innovate solutions. 
5. 
Document the results and process the output. 
Throughout the description of the steps, I will use a concrete example. In this 
case, the example will be the remote control for a TV. I’ll assume that the remote 
control currently looks like that shown in Figure 9-2. I have deliberately under-
designed the remote control, and of course avoided referring to any existing 
branded models. Many of the functions, however, may well resemble those of the 
remote control you have in your living room.

Step 1: Identify Current Pain Points  
When thinking about the number of devices, web pages, and systems that are basi-
cally spammed with serious pain points, you can imagine that identifying these pain 
points might be very difficult. However, nothing could be more wrong. Pain points 
are some of the easiest things to find in your product.  
The problem in many organizations is that fixing pain points is seldom given 
high priority. Nevertheless, you will need to start by identifying the pain points in 
your product. Following are some of my own favorite methods, because they are 
simple, easy, and cheap—and they work. 
Hotlines and Mail Feedback 
Simply ask the people dealing with customer feedback about what questions they 
tend to get asked most. Alternatively, skim through some of the many files that they 
have with feedback, ideas, and complaints. It may take a day or two to do this work, 
but the results may well be worth it. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
85 
Use the Internet 
You may easily find complaints about your product on the Web. Some users will 
start to dislike your product a lot if there are too many pain points, and in their an-
ger they will post blog entries or even launch entire websites dedicated to complain-
ing about your product. Search out those blog entries and sites. Don’t view those 
people as a menace. Instead, use the valuable information they offer about what 
they dislike.  
Usability Tests  
Usability tests—on a small or large scale—often reveal many pain points. A typical 
mistake is to only document and fix the problems found in new applications or fea-
tures that you’ve just designed and tested. Also consider pain points found in your 
existing applications, features, and products.  
User Interviews 
Simply find a few of your current end users, and interview them about pain points. 
People may sometimes be too polite, so make sure that you really get them to open 
up about the problems they experience with your product. 
User Experience Expert Teardown 
A teardown is when you specifically assign someone the task of tearing apart your 
design and looking for problems. This is sometimes the easiest, simplest, and cheap-
est method for finding pain points. Hire a good user experience expert for a few 
hours to review your web page, device, or system, and you will be amazed by how 
many pain points he can produce. As mentioned, finding pain points is not difficult, 
and with the mindset that a good user experience expert has, it is a simple and fast 
task. However, as a rule of thumb, never use the designer who designed the applica-
tion being examined. The reasons are obvious—try to find somebody else. 
Pain Points in a TV Remote Control  
In our TV remote example, the company has identified the pain points shown in 
Figure 9-3. In this case, the company used a user experience expert (me) to find the 
pain points—in less than half an hour. I am sure that you’ll recognize many of these 
pain points, since they exist on a majority of TV remote  controls.

Step 2: Find the Underlying Causes  
Pain points often do not tell you what the actual problem is, and they rarely tell you 
how to solve the problem. Before actually creating solutions for the pain pointsyour 
task is to try to find out what the underlying reasons for the pain points are. For this, 
you may again use different approaches. You will probably need a small group of 
people from different disciplines to come together and examine the causes. 
You can, for example, invite a small group of people for a session. You may 
want to invite people from marketing, interaction design, industrial design, user 
experience, mechanics, consumer feedback, and so on. Who you need to invite will 
depend on the nature of your product (device, system, web page, software system, 
etc.), and it will depend on the size and organizational setup of your company. The 
group does not need to be larger than four to eight people, and the time you want to 
spend doing this does not have to be more than one or two hours. 

User Experience Innovation 
87 
You may also want to invite real users. You might want to contact the person 
behind one of the websites disliking your product, and invite the person to the ses-
sion, paying for his or her flight and hotel for one or two days. You will not only get 
very valuable feedback from this person, but you might also change his or her mind 
about your product and company. 
The method you want to use with the group that you assemble is to start imag-
ining what could be the causes of the problems that the users are experiencing. Go 
through each pain point one by one. You will be surprised at how easy it is to do 
that, and how many potential causes you can come up with in a very short time. 
Figure 9-4 shows an example from the process of finding causes of pain points 
in the remote control example. In the sections to follow, I will go through potential 
causes for all the pain points in the TV remote control example. I’ll be looking at the 
very same pain points illustrated in Figure 9-3.

The Remote Control Does Not Work Unless I Point It 
Directly at the TV 
You may have equipped your remote control with an infrared diode that is simply 
too weak. Maybe you continued to use the same cheap diode that you used when 
TVs were rarely larger than 30 inches in size and when people never sat more than 
10 feet away from the TV when watching and controlling it. 
Maybe you designed the front of your remote control wrong. Maybe the in-
dustrial designer wanted a smooth front on the remote control, and maybe that de-
cision meant a compromise in which the infrared diode had to sink deeper into the 
product, hence reducing the user experience radically. 

Relieving the Pain 
 
88 
Maybe the batteries are used up too fast, or maybe the user does not know 
when the batteries are low and should be replaced. These are all potential causes to 
examine. The point during brainstorming is not necessarily to eliminate causes, but 
rather to list those possible causes deserving a closer look. 
Many Times, the Remote Control Seems to Not Be 
Working, but Then I Realize It’s Pointing in the 
Wrong Direction 
Holding the control in the wrong orientation is a classic and widespread problem 
with remote controls. Many remote controls are designed in a way that makes it 
almost impossible to feel whether they are being held in the correct orientation.  
Designers tend to forget the conditions under which most of their target users 
will need to operate the TV and hence the remote control. The target users will pri-
marily use the TV in the evening, when it is often dark. The users will tend in many 
cases to try to reduce the light in the room to enjoy the TV or movie experience in an 
optimal way. In short, a TV remote control is very often operated in darkness. 
So the cause of this problem of poor orientation is most often an inadequate 
design of the remote control. There is no easy way to feel from the shape or the 
weight distribution of the remote control what is up and down. The few keys that 
the user can distinguish by running their fingers over the remote control are placed 
in the middle, leaving no chance for the user to use these keys as guidance. The two 
ends of the remote control have similarly shaped keys, also leaving no way for a 
hand or fingers to distinguish the front from the back.  
The Remote Control No Longer Works; I Keep  
Changing the Batteries, but After a Few Weeks It Stops 
Working Again 
Failure of a remote to control the device can be caused by bad hardware design that 
drains the batteries too quickly. However, in my experience, this problem is most 
often caused by mode keys, such as in Figure 9-5. Some creative designer or clever 
consumer insight “expert” may have figured out that customers do not like having 
many remote controls to control the different devices in their living room. This re-
sulted in the creation of mode keys, which a user must remember to press first to 
choose which possible target device to control.  
 
Figure 9-5. Mode keys 

User Experience Innovation 
 
89 
The need to reduce remote control clutter may actually be a true and valid user 
need to solve (this is complicated by the fact that many people own TV, VCR, and 
DVD players from different manufacturers). So users may indeed have a true need 
to control multiple devices with a single remote control. But that is not why the 
problem described in this section occurs. The problem occurs due to a badly de-
signed solution for how to operate multiple devices.  
Users can accidentally press one of the mode keys quite easily. This can happen 
when they try to operate the device when it points in the wrong direction, or when 
they accidentally sit on the remote control if it’s lying on the sofa. If they, for exam-
ple, change to DVD mode, the remote control will simply stop working, and the 
users will be unable to change channels, change the volume, or even switch the TV 
on or off.  
Some manufactures have invented a (pretty bad) solution to the problem. With 
some devices, if you remove the batteries, the mode will return to TV mode. In such 
cases, users will then experience that replacing the batteries will solve the problem. 
(On the other hand, remote controls from some other manufacturers will remember 
the last mode even after the batteries are changed). 
Mode buttons are a brilliant example of a design that tries to solve the user 
needs of a limited amount of users (those who own the same brand for all their TV 
devices and those who also understand the concept of the mode keys). However, 
combined with poor design, mode keys can turn the overall user experience into a 
very bad one. This is exactly the way to get customers to really dislike your product. 
I Only Use the Volume Keys and the Zapper Keys, but 
It Is a Real Hassle to Find These Keys in a Dark Room 
This time the user states that she has problems operating the remote in a dark room. 
And the user also states what functions are core for her: changing channels and ad-
justing volume. Of course, a single statement like this may not truly represent which 
keys average users use most often, but it does give a hint. And this hint can be used 
to dig further into the usage of different keys. 
I do not have any precise statistical data, but I would guess that these four keys 
(volume up/down and channel up/down) would account for more than 90 percent 
of all key presses on any TV remote control. A company producing TVs and remote 
controls would probably have some data on this, or they could find out by simply 
looking at the wear and tear on the different keys when remote controls are re-
turned for repair.  
Almost no TV remote controls take this typical and limited use of the remote 
control into account. Figure 9-6 shows one design in common use, but the keys are 
difficult to find in the dark. Figure 9-7 shows another design, one commonly found 
in hotel rooms. The circular pattern is easy enough to find, but many hotel room 
remotes actually use other keys for volume control, leaving the keys in the circle for 
less important tasks.

Figure 9-7. These keys are easy to find in darkness, but they cannot be used for volume 
and zapping. 
I Cannot Turn the Volume Down Quickly Enough 
When I Have to Answer a Phone Call 
This is a very precisely described pain point. But finding the cause of this is slightly 
trickier. Here are some possibilities to consider: 
• 
Maybe the volume keys work too slowly. 
• 
Maybe it comes back to the problem that the user needs to 
point the remote control directly at the TV for it to work (which 
is tricky when you’re also reaching for your ringing phone). 
• 
Maybe the mute key is too hidden or difficult to find in  
darkness. 
• 
Maybe the wording or icon for your mute button is not under-
stood by many users. 
The pain point does indicate that the user is not aware of the mute key, since 
the user specifically explains that turning down the volume is too slow. This should 
put some extra focus on making the mute button easy to understand and find—
even in a dark room.

My Remote Control Stopped Working Because I  
Repeatedly Dropped It on the Floor; I Had to Buy a 
New and Very Expensive Replacement 
This is a case where you really need to dig a bit deeper to find the cause. Maybe your 
customer is just very clumsy, but if you have several customers with the same prob-
lem, you may need to look for other causes. 
It could be that the weight distribution of the remote control is bad. Maybe it is 
too heavy on one end. Figure 9-8 shows such a remote—one that might be easily 
dropped while operating the lower keys. 
 
Figure 9-8. The user could easily drop the remote when operating the lower keys. 
Maybe the user often picks up the remote from the wrong end since the remote 
control does not allow the fingers or hand to feel which way is correct. Or maybe the 
most-used keys are placed in an ergonomically poor  position.

Anecdote 
My experience in the mobile phone industry is that a very large percentage of mobile 
devices need repair due to exposure to water. This water can often be traced back 
to a toilet. The owners of such devices are in most cases male. 
The upfront reason is obvious. Men write a lot of messages while standing over the 
toilet. However, the true cause is slightly trickier and involves the location of certain 
buttons on the devices and how those buttons are used when writing text messages. 
I must admit to being one of the original designers of the function of the star key 
(*)for texting. The star key allows one to easily get the next match when using pre-
dictive text input. The key’s location combined with the typical weight of a mobile 
device makes it very easy for users (at least right-handed ones) to accidentally drop 
the phone when pressing that key (see Figure 9-9). 
History will teach you. When I designed this little shortcut for text writing, SMS was 
hardly used by anyone. And I certainly never imagined that so much texting would 
be done over a toilet. 
 
Figure 9-9. A common way to flood a mobile phone 
Step 3: Verify Your Causes 
After identifying potential causes for your pain points, you are now ready to verify 
these causes. This step is important, since you cannot be sure if your causes are cor-
rect. Maybe people will drop your remote control purely due to poor weight distri-
bution of your device, and hence you will not need to use resources on redesigning 
the keypad layout. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
93 
Why change the entire physical design of your device if the problem is purely in 
the weight distribution? Why redesign an entire application if people only have 
problems with the wording of one specific function? Fixing nonexistent problems is 
of course a waste of time, and you may even introduce new pain points or other 
problems when doing this. 
There may be several approaches to verifying your causes, but it is difficult to 
do without consulting the people who originally stated the pain points. So you will 
need to approach the users—or at least the user experience experts—that provided 
you with the pain points. 
Simple phone interviews with users may do the trick. Short e-mails asking 
about the different causes may be another approach. Inviting the users that had 
pain points for a face-to-face session is a third. 
You will need to describe the different causes that you came up with for their 
pain points, and you can ask the users what they believe is the true cause. Several 
causes may be true for the same pain point, so also allow the users to give more 
than one cause. Finally, the users may state that none of the proposed causes are 
true. In this case you will need to ask further questions of the user to try to find the 
real causes.  
In the TV remote control example, we will assume that the verified causes iden-
tified for each of the pain points are as listed in Figure 9-10. 
 
Figure 9-10. Verified causes for the pain points in the remote control example 

Relieving the Pain 
 
94 
Step 4: Innovate Solutions 
When you know the actual causes of your pain points, you are ready to start innovat-
ing solutions to solve your pain points. The verified causes are similar to any other 
design input: you have a specific problem that needs to be solved. As always, more 
brains work better than one, so invite people from various disciplines in your organi-
zation, and also consider inviting lead users, as described in Chapter 13. 
One approach is illustrated in Figure 9-11 using the TV remote control example. 
The figure shows a single pain point placed in the center, and the verified causes for 
the pain point placed around it. Ideas can then be added with sticky notes or similar. 
Some causes may be hard to tackle, but this is where true creativity comes in 
handy. Let me give an example. You have realized a serious pain point on your web-
site when users try to load a photo album. The cause is that it simply takes time to 
load large images from the user’s computer. 
In this case you need to be creative. Increasing the basic Internet speed for your 
customers is of course not an option. But there are many other ways to speed up the 
loading of images, or at least to give the effect of speeding things up. The solutions 
would fall into two categories: 
1. 
Technical solutions: You may choose to use smaller ver-
sions of a user’s photos when loading the photo album 
(e.g., lower-resolution photos, different image formats, 
etc.). 
2. 
User experience solutions: A typical user experience solu-
tion in this case would be to make it look like the loading 
of the photos goes faster than it actually does. This can be 
achieved by giving instant feedback to the user when 
opening the photo album (the worst type of waiting is 
when nothing happens). You may also choose to start by 
loading very rough and hence small versions of the user’s 
photos, which are then replaced with the higher-quality 
versions.  
Or you may try to make the waiting time more pleasur-
able. Adding pleasure to the waiting time can be done by 
providing constant visual feedback to the user about the 
progress, or maybe adding a very simple game during the 
waiting time (popping balloons on the screen or similar). 
Just be sure that these additions don’t slow down the 
process even more.  
As you see from this example, finding solutions to pain points is not that diffi-
cult when you know the underlying causes of the pain points. 
Figure 9-11 shows an example of innovating solutions for causes of TV remote 
control pain points. To complete the remote control example, the subsequent sec-
tions will list a number of potential solutions for all the verified causes of the pain 
points.

The Remote Control Does Not Work Unless I Point It 
Directly at the TV 
The cause is that the LED used is simply not strong enough. The following are pos-
sible solutions: 
• 
Replace the LED with a stronger one. 
• 
Use a magnifying lens—or a lens that spreads the infrared 
light—in front of the LED. 
Many Times, the Remote Control Seems to Not Be 
Working, but Then I Realize It’s Pointing in the Wrong 
Direction 
The cause is that there is no way for the user to feel in a dark room what the right 
orientation of the remote control is. In this case, a number of solutions could be 
valid, such as the following: 
• 
Change the weight distribution (e.g., make the bottom heavier 
by moving the batteries to this area). This will also make oper-
ation of keys located low on the device easier, because the 
weight will still be resting in the user’s hand. 
• 
Move keys that are easily distinguishable by fingers from the 
middle of the device to one of the ends. The user will over time 
learn this and hence know how to turn the remote control 
correctly. Figure 9-12 shows one possible approach. 

Relieving the Pain 
 
96 
 
Figure 9-12. Often-used and easily distinguishable buttons moved to one end  
• 
Leave an area without keys at the lower part of the remote con-
trol. This will not only make the orientation easy to distinguish 
with the fingers, but it may also improve operation of the lower 
keys on the keypad.  Figure 9-12 shows this approach as well. 
• 
Create a different form factor with a clearly distinguishable top 
and bottom (see the final solution later, in Figure 9-15). 
• 
Add a non-disturbing LED light to your remote control indicat-
ing the correct orientation of the device (see the final solution 
in Figure 9-15 for an example of this approach). 
The Remote Control No Longer Works; I Keep  
Changing the Batteries, but After a Few Weeks It Stops 
Working Again 
The cause is that the user has accidentally pressed a mode key. There may be several 
solutions to this problem. Several of the following solutions can be combined to 
attack this problem: 
• 
Simply remove the mode feature. It is not a shame to realize 
that you have created a design for a small minority of users 
that has ended up as a pain point for a majority of users. Leav-
ing a serious pain point and a reason for frustration is worse. 
• 
Move all operation of other devices to a simple and effective 
onscreen menu. 
• 
Design the mode keys to be flatter and almost impossible to 
press by accident.  

User Experience Innovation 
97 
• 
Use an LED to light up the mode key related to the currently 
selected mode every time a key is pressed (I have seen this 
concept used on even very cheap programmable remote con-
trols). This may (or may not) indicate to the user that the mode 
has been changed.  
• 
Keep the mode buttons but allow them to affect only two to 
four functions typically needed to operate each of the other 
devices. The mode keys could then naturally be placed above 
and together with the function keys affected by the mode 
change, as shown in Figure 9-13. 
Figure 9-13. Redesigned mode concept 
I Only Use the Volume Keys and the Zapper Keys, but 
It Is a Real Hassle to Find These Keys in a Dark Room 
One cause is that the keypad layout does not allow the user to easily find the most 
frequently used keys. The solutions for this cause could be as follows: 
• 
Allow the easily distinguishable five-way key to work as chan-
nel up/down key as well as a volume control key, as many 
older remote controls do. For many new remote controls, 
these prominent and easy-to-find keys only work inside 
menus.  
• 
Position the five-way control at a more prominent location on 
the remote control  (see Figure 9-12, in the previous section). 
• 
Remove keys that have functions that are used very rarely. 
Place the functions in menus or similar instead. 
Another cause is that the design of the remote control does not make it easy for 
the user to point the remote control in the right direction. The solutions here are the 
same as those in the earlier section on orientation. You can reshape the remote or 
change the weight distribution, or do other things to make it easy for users to orient 
the device sight-unseen. 

Relieving the Pain

I Cannot Turn the Volume Down Quickly Enough 
When I Have to Answer a Phone Call 
One cause is that the mute button was not identified or understood by the user. This 
issue can be solved by changing the icon of the mute button, by replacing the icon, 
or by adding text to the button. Adding text is not always the best solution, since it is 
language dependent, and most TV manufacturers do not want to create a specific 
remote control for every language in the world. However, replacing the icon with a 
better one and combining it with a text label may help the situation. 
Another cause is that the mute button is placed in an awkward and illogical lo-
cation. This can be solved by moving the mute button closer to the volume control 
buttons. The four-way scroll keys are already used for controlling volume, and so is 
the mute button, so why not place these buttons close to each other? One idea could 
be to place the mute key in the center of the four-way key, as shown in Figure 9-14. 
Another idea could be to place the mute button right below the volume keys to indi-
cate that pressing this button will turn the volume all the way down.  
 
Figure 9-14. Mute button relabeled and placed close to the volume control keys 
A third cause could be that the remote control is very sensitive to direction. This 
has already been covered. Choose one or more of the solutions to help users identify 
and maintain proper orientation, and implement those solutions.  
My Remote Control Stopped Working Because I  
Repeatedly Dropped It on the Floor; I Had to Buy a 
New and Very Expensive Replacement 
One cause is that the user often picks up the remote control facing the wrong way. 
Several of the previously suggested solutions may solve this problem, but it could 
also be beneficial to change the design of the remote control to have a good grip. 
Another cause is that essential and frequently used keys are placed in a location 
that makes it very easy to drop the remote control. The solution to this could be re-
organizing the keys and leaving an area free of buttons at the lower part of the re-
mote control—as suggested previously.

Improved Remote Control: The Final Result  
Figure 9-15 shows some of the essential solutions identified to reduce the pain 
points for the TV remote control. As you have surely realized by now from my TV 
remote control design, I am a user experience expert and inventor, not an industrial 
designer. Still, the remote in Figure 9-15 does address many frustrations common 
among remote control users even  today. 
 
Figure 9-15. Potential solutions for all the causes of the pain points in the TV remote 
control example 
Step 5: Document the Results and Process the 
Output 
There are certain places in this chapter’s process and method where you can be 
diverted to a wrong track. Maybe the cause that you come up with for a pain point 
was wrong. It may also happen that the solution you designed to fix the pain point 
does not solve the problem—or creates new pain points. 

Relieving the Pain

Verifying the solutions is always essential. Verification can be done through 
usability tests, user interviews, or similar. You can find more inspiration on different 
ways of verifying solutions in Chapter 18. 
You may also want to prioritize your solutions. Some pain points are more 
prominent than others. Some pain points will be noticed by all users, since they 
involve the core functionality of your web page, system, or device. Others may be 
noticed only by the few that use more advanced functionality. I would suggest fo-
cusing first on the pain points that most of your customers will experience, and then 
later focus on the pain points that fewer users experience. 
Additionally, you may want to focus on the pain points that get the most nega-
tive feedback and areas where you have received the most complaints. These pain 
points may not be in the core flow of your product, but they may have a big negative 
impact on your user experience nevertheless. 
Summary 
This chapter has shown you how to find the pain points of your product, it has 
shown you how to find and verify the causes of the pain points, and it has given you 
tools to fix them. 
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, fixing pain points may very well be a 
matter of life and death for your application, system, or device. Pain points really 
cause the end users a lot of pain, which they will have big difficulties forgiving.

Innovating Around  
First Impressions  
The two previous chapters have given you tools to identify and hopefully fix the pain 
points of your current product, as well as to identify and innovate around your core 
tasks. These two methods are also essential for creating user experience innovation 
for the first impression that the users get from your website, device, or system. 
The example I used in Chapter 9 on pain points was a TV remote control, which 
most end users will learn to use no matter how many pain points it has or how little 
the design is focused on the core tasks. That’s because the need for watching TV is 
too strong. They may not buy a TV from the same manufacturer next time, but they 
will learn to operate at least the core functions eventually. 
But what if you are designing a new website for which your market feedback tells 
you that users never come back after visiting the site the first time? What if you de-
sign a train ticket machine, but you notice that all the commuters queue up at the 
counter instead of using your machine? What if you design a calendar feature for 
your social website and find out that no one is using it? 
First impressions—like when you meet another person (Figure 10-1)—will de-
pend on a number of factors. They will depend on the look of your product, the 
screen layout (if any), the location, the attitude, and so on. If you are designing a 
device, first impressions will also depend on the so-called out-of-the-box experience: 
how the packaging looks, how easy it is to open, how many steps it takes to get the 
device working, and so on. 
Also, the purchase experience (e.g., in a shop) and the way you choose to mar-
ket your product is essential for first impressions. The first impression is very much 
about the expectations that the users have of your product, and hence on your 
brand, the product promise, and how you choose to market your product. 
 

Innovating Around First Impressions

Figure 10-1. Example of first impression 
Why First Impressions Are Important 
I do not have data for this, but my claim is that the first impression of your product 
will last much longer than other experiences with your product. My claim is that if 
the first impression of your product is bad, then you will need at least ten brilliant 
user experiences later on to rectify this. 
The problem is, however, that you may never be given the chance to show your 
ten great user experiences, since the users may already have chosen to leave your 
website or stop using your device or software package. 
My theory can be backed up as follows: if you get a bad first impression of a 
person you meet, it will most likely take a lot of time for that person to convince you 
to like him or her. And in many cases you will not even give this person the chance 
to show another side of themselves. 
In the remainder of this chapter I will go through the characteristics of a good 
first impression, followed by some tangible methods for innovating around the first 
impressions of your product. 
Characteristics of a Successful First Impression 
A user experience design with a successful first impression is characterized by a 
number of elements. These are described in the sections to follow. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
103 
Inviting and Simple 
If you are designing a website, you want to make the initial front page inviting yet 
simple. You want to make the front page look professional and have a great design, 
but at the same time you want to give the users a good overview of what you are 
offering. But you also want to focus on the most-visited subpages (remember that if 
the user enters your website through a search engine, then she will most likely skip 
past your front page). 
If you are designing a device, you want to make unpacking the device an easy 
and pleasant experience, as in Figure 10-2. You also want to make sure that the de-
vice is ready to use, without, for example, the user having to charge the device for a 
long time. You also want to make sure that the user can immediately start using the 
core tasks of the device. 
 
Figure 10-2. The out-of-the-box experience is a key part of the first impression for 
devices and similar products. 
If you are designing a piece of software, you want the start-up of your software 
to be fast, and the initial setup to be extremely easy. You also want to make sure that 
the installation is trouble free or even contains positive surprises  (or wow). 
In the train ticket machine example, you want to place the ticket machine in the 
right location; the physical design as well as the first screen should invite the users 
to use the machine. The right location may be next to the ticket counters, but it may 
also be inside the train, thereby avoiding the need for the user to ever miss his train 
due to buying a ticket.

Free of Pain Points 
You want to remove all pain points from the initial use of your product. A good first 
impression is one that is free of pain. Apple, for example, is noted for the care they 
take in the packaging of their products, making even the unboxing experience into a 
wow event.  
If your current website uses a Flash intro that for some users takes more than 
ten seconds or even minutes to load, you will surely need to fix that. You also want 
to look at how easy it is to get an overview of your website and how easy it is to find 
the core tasks.  
If you are designing a device, you want to reduce or remove hurdles such as dif-
ficult unpacking and insertion of batteries. You want to avoid asking questions dur-
ing start-up of the device, and so forth. 
If you are designing a software package, then you want to avoid long and diffi-
cult-to-understand questionnaires and setup procedures before getting to the core 
of what your software can do. You certainly also want to look at removing pain 
points from the process of installing your software. 
In the case of the train ticket machine, you want to remove any barriers that are 
preventing users from using the machine, such as where to find it, how to get 
started, how to choose language, and so on.  
Core Tasks Are at the Center 
The next things you should look at are the core tasks of your product. You want to 
make sure that when the user starts using your product, he can easily and quickly 
perform the core tasks. 
If you are designing a website, you probably want to place the target users’ core 
tasks right on the front page. If you are designing a low-cost mobile phone, you will 
want to lead the user directly to a place where he can perform core tasks like making 
a phone call, writing SMS, and so on. 
In the case of the train ticket machine, you will have to look at whether the in-
itial screen allows the user to immediately start his core task of purchasing a train 
ticket. You will also look at whether the user can perform the task of buying a train 
ticket for his desired destination in a shorter time and with a better experience than 
waiting in the queue for the counter. 
Anecdote 
If you have ever tried using train ticket machines in Germany, you will know how 
bad a first impression they give. The screens are very uninviting, it is highly illogical 
what to do as the first step, and you will find yourself taking as long five minutes to 
get a ticket for a specific train, slogging through five to ten cumbersome steps with 
questions about class and time of departure just to find out that the train is already 
full. On top of this, the payment procedure is very slow and the language of the ma-

105 
chine will sometimes change from your initially selected English to German in cer-
tain situations. I always end up using ten or more minutes at these machines, after 
which I give up and join the long queue at the ticket counter. 
Provide a Wow Factor 
Adding positive surprises is another way to improve the first impression that the user 
gets of your product. Positive surprises can be many things, as you will learn in the 
next chapter. Positive surprises contribute mightily to a good first impression. 
In the train ticket machine example, a positive surprise could be that the ma-
chine—based on, for example, face recognition or detection of your credit card—
will suggest the purchase of a ticket to the same destination as the last time you 
rode. It might also remember which travel class you prefer to use, and so  forth.  
Method for Innovating Around First Impressions 
The following sections will describe a concrete and straightforward approach to 
creating potentially successful user experience innovation around first impressions. 
In overview, the method consists of four steps: 
1. 
Identify core tasks of your first impressions. 
2. 
Identify pain points in your first impressions. 
3. 
Innovate solutions. 
4. 
Document results and process the output. 
Throughout this chapter, I will use as an example a piece of word-processing 
software. I will assume that this software is sold as a DVD in a shop. 
Step 1: Identify Core First Impression Tasks 
The first thing you want is to identify the key elements that are part of the first impres-
sion of your product. You basically want to identify which core tasks the user needs to 
go through to get started using your product. I choose to define these as core tasks 
even though the user may only need to perform these tasks once (depending on your 
product). These tasks are core tasks since if the user does not succeed in performing 
them, then you will most likely already have lost a customer. 
For a device you will hence list things like the packaging, the out-of-the-box ex-
perience, battery insertion and charging, and the experience when the product is 
first switched on. You will also need to look at the interaction of parts when the user 
first starts using your product as intended. 
For a website you will list elements like the start screen, login functionality, in-
itial Flash animations, basic layout, and navigation of your screen, as well as how 
the user gets to and executes the core tasks. For a piece of software, you will need to 
list download experience, or out-of-the-box experience if sold on CD/DVD. You also 

Innovating Around First Impressions 
 
106 
want to list the installation process, which is very often a hurdle for many users, and 
you want to consider the start-up time of your software and the first interactions the 
user needs to go through to start a core task. 
The method for finding the core tasks around your first impressions is basically 
the same as that that described in Chapter 6. In this case, though, you will look 
solely to tasks that users need to go through the first time they unwrap and use the 
product.  
Figure 10-5 shows a list of first impression elements for the example of the 
word-processing software. 
 
Figure 10-5. Example of first impression core tasks for a specific word-processing 
software package 
Anecdote 
When desktop computers first arrived on the scene in a big way during my college 
years, they were often equipped with a 5¼–inch floppy disk drive. I had quite a few 
fellow students who were at that time not yet confident with the computers, and one 
of these students one day tried to install new software on a university computer. The 
software was distributed on multiple floppy disks, and he followed the instructions 

User Experience Innovation 
107 
displayed on the screen. When the first floppy disk was installed, the screen showed 
the message, “Please insert disk 2.” And so he did. But the program didn’t to tell 
him to remove disk 1, and he managed to fit two floppy disks into the drive, and only 
when trying to insert disk 3 did he realize the problem.  
Step 2: Identify First Impression Pain Points 
The next step is to identify which of the core tasks of your first impression includes 
pain points. You can use the same method as described in Chapter 9, but apply the 
method specifically to your first impression tasks. 
You will want to identify in detail what each pain point is about (in the example 
in Figure 10-6 I have marked the problematic areas by underlining them). 
Figure 10-6. Identifying pain points in your first impression (marked in underline) 
Step 3: Innovate Solutions 
You now have the basis for innovating around the user’s first-time experience. 
Again, you will want to gather a group of cross-functional team members and 
ideally some end users. Begin by reviewing your drawing (such as the one in Figure 
10-6), or whatever other list of first impressions you have identified. 

Innovating Around First Impressions 
 
108 
You may want to start with the pain points, but you may also likely find great 
user experience innovation around the core tasks. Figure 10-7 shows an example of 
the outcome of the innovation workshop around the core tasks and pain points for 
the first-time experience.  
 
Figure 10-7. Example of result of innovation around first impression 
Step 4: Document the Results and Process the Output 
How you choose to document your results is up to you, but you will need to list all 
ideas and then verify them with target users. You may, for example, prototype them 
initially in simple ways and present them to target or lead users. Chapter 18 goes 
into detail about prototyping and verification. 
Summary 
This chapter has given you tools and methods to create successful user experience 
innovations for the first impressions that you are giving your users with your pro-
duct. The first impression is extremely important, not only for products like websites 
where the user may leave within seconds if your first impression is not appealing, but 
also for every other type of product, including devices and software packages.

Creating Positive  
Surprises: The Wow Factor 
Many productsproducts in this world are boring. They do what you expect them to 
do, but they never bring a smile to your face or make you laugh. As stated earlier, I 
compare product user experiences with the experience you get when you meet a 
person. If you go to a new dentist, you may be satisfied if he does the job of checking 
and fixing your teeth, but that won’t necessarily make you want to come back to 
him again. Wouldn’t it be great if he also tried to make you calm down by telling a 
joke, or by putting a nice painting in the waiting area? Wouldn’t it be great if you 
actually liked the person behind the drill?  
Being professional and focused but at the same time fun and playful is very sel-
dom a negative combination of personalities for a person.  
The same applies to products. You want the product to be professional, trust-
worthy, and easy to use. But if the product can also make you smile or laugh, you 
will be much more attached to that product. As Figure 11-1 illustrates, it’s much 
better to give users a bit of the wow factor than to besiege them with pain points 
and frustration. 
Anecdote 
Many early phones from Nokia had a flat bottom because that was where a number 
of connectors were placed. The flat bottom made it possible for the phones to stand 
up on a table. The built-in vibration device in some products (due to space con-
straints inside the device) faced the opposite direction than was usual. This meant 
that if the phone was standing up and you received a call or SMS, the phone would 
start rotating while standing on the table. That rotation was later made into a design 
requirement. The first products did it unintentionally, but it made people smile, so a 
new requirement was born. It is easy to create pain points by accident. It is, how-
ever, more difficult to create positive surprises like this by accident. 
 

Creating Positive Surprises: The Wow Factor 
 
110 
 
Figure 11-1. Wow vs. frustration and pain points 
The method described in this chapter is slightly different from the previous 
ones. This chapter’s method focuses on adding small innovative surprises to the end 
user in essential places in your product. This method does not necessarily provide 
any new functionality or technologies to your device, system, or web page, but it 
may improve your user experience considerably, simply by giving the user a nice 
experience with the core parts of your product. 
Adding small surprises or wows to your product is in some situations more im-
portant than actually adding new functionality or technologies. New functionality 
may take a long time for users to understand and learn, and new technologies may 
take several years to take off and to be adopted by users. Positive surprises (or 
wows) may on the other hand be immediately acknowledged and appreciated by 
your customers. 
So why not focus on creating positive surprises (or wows) for the things you al-
ready have in your product? Why not try to create a great experience instead of 
frustration and pain points? A wow can simply be a good-looking graphical layout or 
funny icons. It can be the look or design of your device, or it can be small, intelligent 
features. A wow can be anything that brings unexpected delight to your users. 
If you are designing a web page, positive surprises can be visual, in the form of 
graphics or structure. A feature that detects the language of the user could be a posi-
tive surprise. Sometimes it’s enough to surprise the user that the web page simply 
provides the user with the information or functionality that the user wants. Another 
positive for a web page can be that it loads very fast. 
If you are designing a device, a positive surprise can be that the battery is pre-
charged, or it can be that everything is already set up and ready to be used. It can also 
be a hidden cool game on a device where you would never expect to find a game.

Anecdote 
I started in the mobile phone industry in 1992, when some of the very first digital 
mobile phones were developed. At that time, the target users were businessmen, 
mainly since these devices had a price of around $2,000 and could more or less 
only place and receive calls. 
The first mobile phone I worked on was the Hagenuk MT 900. It was equipped with 
a fully graphical display. That was at a time when segmented displays were the 
normal technology. 
Over a single weekend and in my spare time, I implemented a Tetris game for the 
device, and showed a working version of it the following Monday. Even though play-
ing games was not seen as a core task for the target users, the idea quickly gained 
traction inside the company, and the company decided to integrate the game into 
the next product, the Hagenuk MT-2000 (shown in Figure 11-2). The game was 
seen as a positive and unexpected surprise, and a large number of customers loved 
it. In this way I managed to bring the first game ever to a mobile phone. 
Positive surprises very much depend upon the expectations of the user. If your 
competition is already doing something, it will be a lot more difficult (but not im-
possible) to turn your innovation involving the same thing into a positive surprise. 
A general rule of thumb is that you should never create wow for its own sake. 
Unnecessary animations and design that slow down the core tasks of the user will 
easily turn into pain points.

phone with a game

Characteristics  
Positive surprises (or wows) can take many shapes and forms, but at their essence 
they leave users with a smile on their face or a good feeling inside. 
They Bring a Smile 
A positive surprise can, for example, happen via a small animation when a user 
opens a menu. A positive surprise can also come with a small, hidden feature that 
the user learns to use after a lot of experience with your program.  
A wow is in nature very close to a positive surprise, but it will give the user an 
even more positive feeling. With a wow, the user may even say “great,” “cool,” or 
“wow” (not necessarily out loud, but at least in their own mind). 
Often playfulness is a way to achieve wows and positive surprises.  
Many people experience the wow feeling when they try a car that has a lot more 
horsepower than they are used to. Many experience wow when they return from a 
successful date or when their child takes its first steps. If you achieve these same 
feelings through your product, then you will have a very good chance of successful 
user experience innovation. 
They Exceed Expectations 
Positive surprises will very much depend on the expectations of your end users. For 
example, Apple customers will be highly disappointed if the user experience does 
not provide some level of wow.  If you work at a company selling word-processing 
software, you may need to create more positive surprises and wow than the major 
players already ruling the market. If you are a newcomer in a mature market, such 
as the mobile device industry, you will want to raise the bar considerably for posi-
tive surprises and wow. Somehow, you need to exceed what your customers and 
users have come to expect. Only then can you surprise them. 
They Are in the Open  
One thing to realize is that placing a positive surprise or wow in a deeply hidden 
place or in a rarely used feature of your product will make only a very small percent-
age of your users surprised and happy; the surprise will not reach the majority of 
your users, and hence the effect of your efforts will be very limited. You want your 
surprises and wows to reach the majority of your users. You want to place the sur-
prises in your core tasks and in where they will cause a good first impression. 
They Cause No Pain 
Creating surprises and wow in the core interaction without actually creating pain 
points is a very fine balance. Many user experience elements that have been  
designed and added to create a wow end up becoming serious pain points instead.

User Experience Innovation

A great (or rather sad) example is the number of web pages with Flash intros (see 
Figure 11-3). While these may take just a few seconds to load on the designer’s 
computer, they often take tens of seconds or even minutes to load for an average 
user. 
As a general rule, positive surprises and wow should never be perceived as pain 
points, even for a small percentage of your users. For example, assume you’ve cre-
ated an animation that plays when users open a new menu in your application.  If 
users think the animation is slowing the loading of the menu, even if it’s not, then 
you have created a perceived pain point. If many of your users believe that the ani-
mation is delaying the core task that they want to accomplish, your perceived pain 
point ends up becoming a real pain point.  
Design your positive surprises and wows carefully—and within the core inter-
action of your product. Such innovations can move your system, device, or web 
page from average to premium. 
 
Figure 11-3. When an attempt to create wow becomes a pain point 
How to Wow 
There are a number of methods to creating positive surprise and wows. You can 
create them through visual layouts and animations, you can create them by placing 
small treasures in your product, and you can even create them by building in intelli-
gent solutions that surprise your users. 
Visual Surprises and Wows 
The most obvious—and common—way for many products to create positive sur-
prises and wows is through visual communication: the layouts, icons, animations, 
images, and so on. For example, you can create visual surprises and wows by de-
signing the layout of your web page simply, with easy-to-understand icons and a 
clear and easy overview. You can also add Flash animations, but as mentioned be-
fore, do so with great care. 

Creating Positive Surprises: The Wow Factor 
 
114 
If you are designing a device, you can create an outstanding physical design, 
you can create state-of-the-art graphics, and you can create logical visual flows for 
achieving the core tasks. If you are designing a piece of software, you can create a 
great layout for your application, innovative icons, cool animations, and so on—but 
of course you should consider the start-up time of your software. 
Anecdote 
The most successful web page in the world is Google’s search page. But you cer-
tainly cannot say that Google has the most impressive visual experience. When Goo-
gle launched its search engine, it basically had only two wows: the speed of loading 
the initial page (due to reduced graphics on the main page) and the speed at which 
it could find and return suitable and good search results.  
I believe that Google has deliberately maintained its original, simple look for histori-
cal reasons and to communicate that your core task is its main focus. Google is 
hence a brilliant example of how you can create wow without focusing solely on the 
visual impression. 
Playfulness 
Playfulness is often an overlooked element of user experience design and innova-
tion. Many influential people in your company (e.g., in management) take the pro-
ducts very seriously, and they will often argue that your product is designed for, for 
example, business purposes. But since when did business have to be boring?  
Anecdote 
What is the real value of Google Maps and Google Earth? Is it the fact that you can 
find a specific place or route, as shown in Figure 11-41? No. I would claim that the 
real value of these products is in their playfulness. They are simply just fun to play 
around with. Seeing your childhood home becomes an attraction. Moving around in 
the world, perhaps by exploring satellite images, becomes fun.

Playfulness can no longer be achieved simply by adding a small arcade game to 
a device or web page. Playfulness should ideally be an integral part of the entire user 
experience. 
Playfulness will become an increasingly important competitive factor, not only 
for areas where user experience is already a focus (mobile devices, web pages, etc.), 
but also for products where there has traditionally been little or no focus on user 
experience (washing machines, word processors, hi-fi equipment for homes, medi-
cal devices, etc.). If you think that you are in a business where you do not need to 
look at playfulness, well then write me an e-mail and I will claim that you may be 
wrong.  
Anecdote 
Bang & Olufsen originally became famous for actually creating a design for—at 
that time—very dull-looking hi-fi equipment. The company later began to create 
not only state-of-art device designs, but also a number of mechanical and highly 
playful elements, such as CD doors that open automatically when a hand is in prox-
imity of the device. 
One classical invention was the fast-moving CD changer arm in the BeoSound 9000 
6 CD player. Even when launched many years ago, it could have been possible to 
store the music electronically, so that the pause between playing two CDs could 
have become almost zero. That goal could have been achieved without moving the 
CD changer arm any more than 100 km/h. Instead, Bang & Olufsen chose to equip 

Creating Positive Surprises: The Wow Factor 
 
116 
the device with the fastest-moving arm in the industry, and even made it visible 
through a glass plate, as shown in Figure 11-5. This is a great example of designing 
playful experiences—even when engineering solutions could have solved the same 
core task for the target user.

Hidden Treasures 
Focusing only on creating surprises and wow around visual elements may not be 
sufficient. For many types of products, the visual appearance is where your compe-
tition will also go first, so you will want to innovate in other areas as well in order to 
stay ahead. 
Another way to create positive surprises and wows is by innovating so-called 
hidden treasures. Hidden treasures cover a large variety of small surprises or wows 
that the user will find over time. Figure 11-6 shows an example of a small positive 
surprise on the carton for Innocent’s Pure Fruit Smoothie drink.  
Hidden treasures can also be shortcuts to often-used functions that the user 
may not realize in the beginning but will learn over time. Finding a faster way to 
accomplish a task can for many users be a very positive experience.

Anecdote 
Many years ago, when predictive text input was still very new, my nontechnical-
minded brother started using the predictive text feature on his Nokia device—and 
he loved it. But one day he told me about a pain point. He felt that it was quite cum-
bersome to change the suggested word to another possible match.  
I asked him how he did it. When the word was not correct, he would press the Op-
tions soft key and scroll all the way down to the function called “Next match.” When 
I then told him about the shortcut for that functionality via the star key, he said, 
“Wow, that is so smart.” 
Actually, one could in this situation argue that getting the next match is a core task 
for many users and that the user experience of this core task was not initially de-
signed well enough. That may well be true. However, with this specific user, his 
original pain point turned into a wow. 
Hidden treasures can also be free downloadable games or other functionality 
that is gained as a reward when the user has used the product some time. Hidden 
functions that can be activated only through a secret code may also be seen as 
treasures, at least if your target users have a tendency to try to find and share such 
treasures. An example of a hidden treasure for a GPS-enabled mobile device could 
be the presentation of a free downloadable game or application when the user first 
enters a specific GPS location. For a social website it could be free credits when the 
user gets more than 100 friends. 
An important thing to emphasize for hidden treasures is that you should never 
deliberately choose to initially hide functions needed to accomplish core tasks. 
Doing so will almost automatically create a pain point. But if you want to offer some 
extra goodies for certain passionate users, hidden treasures can provide a very at-
tractive path. 
Hidden treasures can also spread via viral marketing. For example, you may be 
able to find discussion forums where people share how to obtain these goodies. 
Thus, having the goodies will engender positive discussion of your product. 
Again, do not hide or obstruct essential features. In my mind, a number of 
shareware software developers have gone way too far in hiding essential function-
ality until you purchase the product. Users have already gone through a cumber-
some download and installation process, and they may become very dissatisfied and 
uninstall your software immediately if they cannot try out the product for real before 
purchasing. A time limit for the use may be a far better option in the case of share-
ware software. Don’t obstruct the very reason to use your product in the first place. 
Intelligence and Context Awareness 
Intelligent behavior in your product can also provide users with positive surprises and 
wow. If your web page automatically detects the needed language to be used, this 
could be a convenient and positive surprise. However, make sure to not make it a 

Creating Positive Surprises: The Wow Factor 
 
118 
pain point when your language guess is wrong. I have, for example, been travelling to 
Southeast Asia for a year now, and I am pretty fed up with Google always presenting 
me with texts in Thai, Filipino, or similar. But at least there is a shortcut and some text 
written in English to help me switch to English again. But why does the web page not 
remember my language selection the next time I visit it? 
Concerning web pages, I see a potential for remembering not only your login 
information and your language preferences, but also for remembering the last task 
you were performing when you last exited the page. Why do social web pages dis-
card my half-finished e-mails if I exit? Why can I not simply continue writing my e-
mail when I enter the web page again?  
Another example of intelligent positive surprises for a web page is when your 
web page learns the tasks that the user typically performs, and then makes it easier 
and faster to get to these tasks. 
An example of user experience innovation intelligence for cars is remembering 
the seat angle settings when the user enters the car. For a train or bus ticket ma-
chine, an example of an intelligent wow could be a camera recognizing your face 
and suggesting tickets to the destinations where you have gone previously, just as 
the person behind the ticket counter may over time learn where you typically want 
to go. If you are designing a mobile device, the device may over time detect which 
functions you typically use, and then place a shortcut to these on your desktop. 
When designing intelligent positive surprises and wows, you need to consider 
security issues and be very observant of privacy issues. Many users do not like sys-
tems that start changing things without warning. Seeing your entire history of previ-
ously visited web pages in your browser can be great for you, but maybe not so great 
for your wife or husband.  
Some of what I’ve mentioned in this section relates to context awareness. That 
speaks to a product’s ability to react differently depending upon the context in which 
it is used. You’ll read more about that aspect of user experience in Chapter 16. 
Methods for Innovating  
You’ve just finished reading about how to create positive surprises in the sense of 
how and where to consider creating features in your product. That’s the easy prob-
lem to solve, actually. The real question is this: How do you discover and decide 
which specific surprises to implement? Next we will look at several methods by 
which to answer that question. 
Creating Positive Surprises and Wows for Core Tasks 
To present positive surprises and wows that have a big impact, you want to place 
them where most of your users will see or experience them. Placing a wow for a 
function that is rarely used by any of your users will not give any impact. Thus, 
center your efforts around the core tasks of your product. 
You can, for example, place each of your core tasks in the center of a diagram, 
and then place applications, technologies, user needs, pain points, and so on 
around it. You may not need a full list of applications and technologies around the 

User Experience Innovation 
 
119 
core task; you can instead focus on areas where you already have an idea of where 
positive surprises or wows can be hidden. You may also want to list only user needs 
that are relevant to surprises and wows. 
Figure 11-7 shows how such a list could look for a specific piece of video con-
version software, where a core task has been identified around converting and 
transferring movies to mobile devices. In this figure I have placed user needs, tech-
nologies, pain points, and applications around this specific core task. 
 
Figure 11-7. Core task placed in the middle of the diagram for the video conversion 
software example 
Figure 11-8 shows how you can then invite a group of people with different ex-
pertise and ideally some lead users to a session to innovate for your specific product 
(in this example, a video conversion software package).

the core task 
Creating Positive Surprises and Wows for the First 
Impression 
The first impression for many products, such as web pages and some types of soft-
ware, is often where you will either get and keep a new customer, or lose the cus-
tomer and never see them again. For all types of products, it is important to create 
positive surprises and wows around the first impressions.  
Follow the method in Chapter 10 for innovating around first impressions. That 
method will help you place positive surprises and wows into the first impressions of 
your product. The first impression of your product is also a place to be sure not to 
create pain points, so—as mentioned before—be very observant about potential 
wows and surprises created around the first impression. 
Avoid Unnecessary Wows 
You must achieve a balance between providing positive surprises and wows on one 
hand, and on the other hand making sure not to be too clever. Remember that the

121 
difference between a wow and a pain point is often paper thin. A surprise element 
that is seen by 60 percent of users as a wow and 20 percent of users as a pain point 
should be redesigned or reconsidered.  
Too much visual wow on your web page may easily become a pain point if the 
user believes that it slows down performing his core tasks. Hidden treasures may be 
a pain point if you, for example, choose to hide core functions. Overly intelligent 
solutions may intimidate a large number of your users and might make them dislike 
your product. Avoid creating surprises that might be perceived as pain points. 
Summary 
Creating positive surprises and wows is an essential part of successful user ex-
perience innovation, but it is also a difficult exercise where you need to balance cre-
ating true wows and pain points. If you follow the methods and guidelines de-
scribed in this chapter, you may potentially come up with things that truly make 
your product stand out.

Innovating Around an  
Ecosystem 
If you are designing a product, it is tempting to focus on the core of your product 
only. However, a lot of successful user experience innovation has been done around 
the core product. Here are some examples: 
• 
If you are designing a mobile device, you can create user ex-
perience innovation by providing great tools for your PC or the 
Internet that can be used to extend or support the user experi-
ence of your device. You will look at successful service provid-
ers and maybe ask permission to use their services. 
• 
If you are designing a social web page, you can look at how to 
integrate services from other web pages, or you can make it 
very easy for your customers to transfer account data, friend 
lists, and so forth from a competing social web page. You can 
also look at how to integrate your services in a great way for 
mobile devices. 
• 
If you are designing video conversion software, you could look 
at how to download alternative subtitles from the Internet and 
how to easily connect your computer to a TV. 
The trick is to not limit your definition of your product to the actual product it-
self; rather, you should see your product as whole ecosystem. 
Anecdote 
When the Apple iPod was launched in 2001 (see Figure 12-1), it got a lot attention 
due to its design and the basic user experience of the product itself, but it did not 
become really successful until the entire ecosystem (e.g., with the iTunes music 
store and the iTunes PC application) was put into place  in 2003. My view is that the 
real reason for the success of the iPod was the superior user experience of the eco-
system that was built around the iPod. 
Most competitor music devices at that time supported a USB connection. However, 
buying and transferring music was a cumbersome process. The process was also 
cumbersome if the user wanted to convert and transfer her existing CD music  

Innovating Around an Ecosystem

collection to the device. The iPod and the surrounding ecosystem removed all those 
pain points. 
Apple’s ecosystem has over the years and with the introduction of the iPhone and 
iPad been successfully extended by Apple to cover applications as well as music. 
The ecosystem is highly successful now, and includes movies, games, music, life-
style and productivity applications, and so forth. A large part of the success of the 
iPhone, not least when it comes to application downloading, is due to Apple’s exist-
ing and (for the users’) well-known and appreciated ecosystem.

Introducing the Method 
The method of innovating around your ecosystem consists of the following steps: 
1. 
Identify target user needs and potential future core tasks. 
2. 
Identify your potential ecosystem. 
3. 
Draw your ecosystem. 
4. 
Innovate around your ecosystem. 
5. 
Document and process the results. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
125 
Throughout this chapter I will use an e-book reader application as an example. 
We will assume that this e-book reader is already available for Internet tablets  
and PCs.  
Step 1: Identify Target User Needs and Potential 
Future Core Tasks 
As with all user experience innovation, you need to know who your customers are 
and what their current and latent needs are. And you will need to know which tasks 
the user would like to achieve with your product. You will also want to know the 
pain points, because some of your pain points may actually derive from your cur-
rent ecosystem rather than from your product. 
By examining the target users’ needs, core tasks, and pain points, you will be 
able to identify the potential ecosystem of your product. And based on this you will 
be able to create potentially successful user experience innovations. 
Step 2: Identify Your Potential Ecosystem 
The first thing you want to do is to identify your ecosystem. This step is not only 
about identifying your current ecosystem, but very much also about identifying 
your potential ecosystem. 
If you are designing a social website, you may want to look at how to integrate 
features from (maybe competing) social websites, from weather forecast providers, 
from existing online calendar applications, and so forth. You may want to look at 
providing dedicated PC or mobile device applications that may improve or extend 
the experience of your website. 
If you are designing a remote control device, you will need to look at potential 
accompanying PC software for setting up the remote control and potential Inter-
net services to help the user out. For example, if your remote control is for a TV, 
you might want to design onscreen menus that allow the user to personalize the 
remote control. 
If you are designing a mobile device, you will need to look at the entire eco-
system involving how the user downloads new applications to the device; how the 
user edits, backs up, and shares contacts via a PC or the Internet; and so forth.  
If you are designing a piece of PC software, you will need to look at how integra-
tion with your Internet-based services (e.g., templates, settings, and similar) can 
easily be applied. You will also need to look at applying your PC software to specific 
physical devices, such as mobile phones. And you will need to look at how you can 
potentially integrate your solutions with other PC software. 
I have deliberately avoided using the phrase thinking outside the box previously 
in this book, since that term has been misused to cover so many different things. 
But in this case you really need to think outside of the box. And in this case your box 
is the specific product—or sometimes even part of the product—that you are de-
signing. And outside of the box can refer to many things—from obvious ecosystem 

Innovating Around an Ecosystem 
 
126 
elements to the fridge in the user’s kitchen. You need to see your device, system, or 
web page from a much bigger perspective. 
You need to be very open-minded when thinking about your potential eco-
system, but you also need to restrict yourself. Potentially any product in this world 
could communicate with a fridge, a coffee machine, or an Internet service, but you 
need to keep your focus on the relevant ecosystem elements.  
A good general approach to identifying and prioritizing your ecosystem ele-
ments is to invite a group of people for a meeting specifically to identify those ele-
ments. As always, you should also invite users to this session, and in this case lead 
users would be an obvious choice, since these users may be able to think outside of 
the box for your product. 
Following, I will go through concrete approaches to identifying and prioritizing 
your ecosystem elements. 
User Needs for Identifying Ecosystem Elements 
To identify the relevant ecosystem elements you should use the user needs of your 
target users. User needs will often reveal potential and uncovered ecosystem ele-
ments of your product.  
If you are designing an Internet tablet, the user needs may, for example, reveal 
the need for easily downloading or streaming music. And you should hence include 
music download and music streaming to your ecosystem. If you are designing a 
piece of word-processing software, user needs may reveal that the users have a need 
to perform spreadsheet functions, and you would hence add spreadsheet applica-
tions to your ecosystem. And so forth. 
In the example of an e-book reader application, the user needs include the 
ability to get a new book when finished with the last book, and hence book publish-
ers for e-books should be added to the ecosystem. Actual authors of novels, litera-
ture, poems, and so on would also be added. 
Another need for the target users of the e-book reader is the ability to read a 
book even when commuting to and from work. Hence adding mobile devices to the 
ecosystem is natural. 
A third user need identified for the e-book reader is that users would love to 
have their reading experience enhanced—for example, with music and background 
images. This means that music providers and image providers are added to the 
ecosystem. 
Core Tasks for Identifying Ecosystem Elements 
Also, ,the core tasks can help you identify and prioritize your ecosystem. If the user 
has several core tasks that are poorly covered or not covered by your product, then 
these are very important ecosystem elements.  
If you are designing a smart phone, you may find out that downloading a new 
application to the device is a core task. So you should add application providers and 
probably also application developers to your ecosystem. If you are designing a video 

User Experience Innovation 
 
127 
conversion application for PCs, you may find out that burning a DVD disc is a core 
task, and if your software does not already support this, you will want to add it to 
your ecosystem. 
In the case of the e-book reader application, one of the identified core tasks is 
printing the book. Hence printers are added to the ecosystem. 
Pain Points for Identifying Ecosystem Elements 
Finally, ,pain points often reveal elements of your ecosystem, especially those ele-
ments where the current solutions are not good enough. 
If you are designing a mobile device, you might identify a pain point around 
connecting to the Internet, and you will hence include the network operators’ han-
dling of Internet connections as part of the ecosystem. If you are designing an LCD 
TV, and users report that setting up the channels is a hurdle, then you might decide 
that a PC interface and application should be part of your ecosystem. If the TV is able 
to connect to the Internet, you could also add web services to your ecosystem. 
With the e-book reader example, it has been identified that the fonts used for 
displaying the text are hard to read. Hence font providers are added to the  eco-
system. 
Step 3: Draw Your Ecosystem 
When you have identified, categorized, and prioritized your ecosystem elements, 
you are ready to create a simple drawing of your ecosystem on a whiteboard or 
similar. 
Figure 12-2 shows how a drawing might look for the e-book reader application. 
Step 4: Innovate Around Your Ecosystem 
You are now basically ready to innovate user experience improvements for your 
ecosystem. Again, you want to invite a group of people (including, e.g., lead users) to 
an open innovation session.  
As mentioned earlier, innovating around your ecosystem requires you to get out 
of your box. You will need to think how you can improve the interfaces in various 
parts of your ecosystem, and you might even want to remain open to entirely new 
sources of content for your product. You might even suggest including functionality 
from third-party software developers or web pages. 
 
 

Innovating Around an Ecosystem 
128 
Figure 12-2. Ecosystem for the e-book reader application 
User Needs, Core Tasks, and Pain Points 
A concrete method to start innovating around your ecosystem is to directly apply 
target user needs, core tasks, and pain points to each of the identified ecosystem 
elements, and try to come up with truly innovative solutions for these needs, tasks, 
and pain points. You will be surprised at how these elements can also be extremely 
useful for user experience innovation for your ecosystem. 
Displaced Simplicity 
Another possibility is to use a method called displaced simplicity. Displaced sim-
plicity refers to using an alternative platform or software product to solve a task that 
may be complex to solve with your own product. 
If you are designing a mobile device, you might for example want to move 
complex tasks to PC software. If you are designing a remote control for a TV, you can 
move complex setup of the remote control to onscreen menus on the TV. If you are 
designing a PC application, such as an e-book reader, you might choose to displace 
complex functions to a supporting web page. And so forth. 
When displacing functionality to another platform, it is seldom a good idea to 
simply copy the original functionality to the other platform. For users to actually 
spend the time and effort to use a different platform, you have to provide a true 

User Experience Innovation 
 
129 
benefit for them. Simply moving your original functionality or copying the same 
interaction to another platform without any obvious reason or benefit may end up 
introducing a pain point instead. 
E-book Reader Example 
In the case of the e-book reader, the result of the innovation session could end up 
looking as shown in Figure 12-3. 
 
Figure 12-3. Example of ecosystem innovation 
Step 5: Document and Process the Results  
Documenting your results can be done in many ways, but verifying the results with 
end users is essential. In the case of involving third-party elements, you may also 
want to verify your results with third-party companies and interest groups. 
You may also want to prioritize the user experience innovations found around 
the ecosystem. This is an important task, since fixing elements in the ecosystem can 
be extremely difficult, as certain factors will often be more or less out of your hands. 
But even difficult ecosystem innovations should be considered if they will have a big 
impact on the user experience. 

Innovating Around an Ecosystem 
 
130 
Summary 
Innovating user experience around the ecosystem can be challenging, but it can also 
provide you with truly successful user experience innovation. Some of your best 
user experience innovations may be around your ecosystem.  
 

C H A P T E R

Innovating with  
Lead Users 
The traditional method for innovation is to first find the needs of the users and then 
return to the company to create innovations within a team of colleagues. But why 
not involve the users in the innovation process? 
However, you cannot ask just any user to be creative. The vast majority of users 
will only be able to explain where they have problems with your product, what their 
specific needs are, and what functions they use.  
You need to find lead users. Lead users are characterized by creatively using 
your or competitive products. You might be able to find users who already design 
their own applications for your device, system, or web page. You might be able to 
find users who have already found their own workarounds for their needs with your 
product. You also might be able to find users who write blogs about how you or the 
competition could improve the products.  
The steps for lead user innovation are as follows: 
1. 
Find lead users 
2. 
Prepare for a lead user workshop 
3. 
Run the workshop 
4. 
Document your results and process the output 
The sections to follow provide tangible approaches to creating successful user 
experience innovations with your lead users. 
Intellectual Property and Secrecy Concerns 
Many companies are concerned about workshops being held with end users due to 
intellectual property rights and secrecy issues. Such concerns can, however, be 
solved by agreeing with the users before the workshop and by using nondisclosure 
agreements. Creating those agreements may require that you involve your legal de-
partment to prepare the necessary documents. 
1

Innovating with Lead Users 
 
132 
Step 1: Find Lead Users 
Lead users can be found in several ways. You may already know a few of them from 
your company’s complaint hotline. Or you can find them via the Internet by looking 
for people who have created their own small improvements to your product. Or you 
will find them by looking through the logs of official e-mail to your company. 
You can also use an agency to find suitable lead users, and you can even ask a 
professional facilitator with user experience background to do your preparations 
and to run the workshop. This may be a good idea, at least the first time, for learning 
the tricks, but it will also be more expensive. 
Instead of seeing these users as menace to your company who spam your in-
boxes and hotlines, invite them for a creative workshop. These people will in many 
cases take two days out of their calendar just to be with you—for free! Of course, you 
should give them compensation if they need to stay in a hotel, and so on, but other-
wise these customers usually come almost free of charge, and it is very wise to use 
their insights and creativity. 
Anecdote 
At Nokia, we ran an innovation project for physically challenged people. Initially we 
were unaware of the problems that some people with disabilities had using mobile 
devices. We were also unaware of how much these people actually relied on their 
mobile devices. The mobile device was often their main communication tool to the 
outside world—for chatting, socializing, finding their way around, requesting assis-
tance, and so on. 
We invited a group of 11 lead users for a workshop, together with our cross-
functional team of industrial designers, user interaction experts, software develop-
ers, mechanical engineers, and so on. Not only were the lead users all involved in 
developing their own solutions for mobile devices, but they were also characterized 
by all being physically challenged.  
The workshop was a true eye-opening experience. Finding accommodation in Co-
penhagen for blind people and people in wheelchairs was in itself a huge challenge. 
Finding a restaurant that could accommodate wheelchairs and where hearing-
impaired people would not be disturbed by the acoustics was another huge chal-
lenge. I personally spent more than one week just making the practical arrange-
ments for this workshop. I was forced directly into the problems that people with 
physical challenges have. And that in itself was extremely inspiring for me.  
We had sign-language translators in the room for the two hearing-impaired people. 
During breaks, those members used their mobile devices to communicate with their 
friends through video calls. The member without arms would eat breakfast, lunch, 
and dinner with his feet. The blind member typed on his mobile device to take notes 
and write down ideas. The workshop not only produced a large number of concrete 
ideas, but it also revealed many specific user needs for these target user groups. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
133 
Figure 13-1 shows an example of a lead user. Your lead users may however, be 
completely different.  
 
Figure 13-1. A lead user 
Step 2: Prepare for the Workshop 
Apart from the practical arrangements for the workshop, you will want to ensure a 
good location for it, with lots of room and tools to enhance creativity. You can do 
the preparations yourself, and perhaps learn quite a lot about your lead users in the 
process, or you can have, for example, a user experience practitioner do the work 
for you. 
When inviting users, you do not want them to feel overwhelmed, so do not in-
vite the entire company of 100 people to meet with 2 lead users. A good distribution 
is around 50 percent lead users and 50 percent people from your company. 
If you are planning a workshop that will run for two or more days, one idea is to 
have the colleagues who are not participating in the workshop be on standby for 
some evening work. You can ask these colleagues to create demos or prototypes of 
the ideas that came up during the lead user workshop. These ideas can then be pre-
sented and discussed on the following day. This will speed up the innovation pro-
cess, and you will get instant feedback on your ideas. And it will surely impress your 
lead users. 
You also want the lead users to prepare for the meeting. You can for instance 
ask the lead users to prepare for presenting five specific needs that they have, five of 
6

Innovating with Lead Users 
 
134 
their most prominent core tasks, and five pain points. To make it easier for them, 
you can prepare templates that describe each of the terms and provide spaces for 
the users to list their answers (e.g., as shown in Figure 13-2). 
 
Figure 13-2. Template for lead users to prepare before the workshop 
Step 3: Run the Workshop 
Now it’s time to run the workshop, as illustrated in Figure 13-3. One advantage of 
doing innovation with users is that it gives you a good chance of designing things 
that actually cover a real user need. You can also verify your solutions quickly, since 
you can ask the users questions right away. 
 
Figure 13-3. Example of a lead user workshop 

User Experience Innovation 
 
135 
Another advantage is that your users will likely come up with quite different so-
lutions than you do. You may be stuck in a company- or technology-driven mindset 
that the lead users do not have. 
Finally, during the workshop you can identify user needs and core tasks that 
you might have difficulty finding in an interview. During the workshop you can 
focus your innovations around the specific needs, core tasks, and pain points of the 
lead users that you invited, or you can use general needs for the target users as the 
basis of your innovations. But keep in mind that users generally will want to solve 
their own problems rather than somebody else’s. 
A structured approach during the workshop is to create innovations for the five 
user needs, core tasks, and pain points that each of the lead users have prepared. For 
further details on specific methods for this, refer to Chapter 4 for identifying user 
needs, and Chapters 6 and 9 for innovating around core tasks and pain points, re-
spectively. 
At the end of the workshop, you can spend some time with your lead users to 
prioritize the solutions and ideas that were created, thereby reducing (but not  
eliminating) the need for subsequent verification of your solutions. When prioritiz-
ing, you should listen to the users’ opinions, but you can also contribute with feasi-
bility evaluations, and so on. 
Step 4: Document the Results and Process the 
Output 
After the workshop, you should document all the user experience innovation ideas 
that came out. You may also want to prototype the most prominent potential ideas 
to verify with further target users. For more details on prototyping and verifying 
ideas, please refer to Chapter 18. 
Summary 
Lead user workshops can provide you with unique user experience innovation ideas 
that may never have come up inside your organization or company. Lead users will 
also give you very rapid feedback on your solutions, which otherwise could take 
weeks to get. 
Lead user workshops are valuable for any kind of product or target user group, 
and in particular if you do not yet have deep insights into the needs, core tasks, and 
pain points of your current users—or if you are targeting a new group of target 
users.

Copying with Pride 
Successful user experience innovations are rarely characterized by being first to 
market, but rather by being done right. In other words, innovations become suc-
cessful when the user experience is great. Copying your competitors or other busi-
nesses is a great opportunity to create successful user experience innovation. But 
when copying, you really need to focus on doing it right.  
The steps are pretty straightforward. You first need to find user experience in-
novation in competitor products, and then you need to improve these to make them 
successful. The methods for making the innovations successful are not much differ-
ent from those described in previous chapters. The four steps needed for creating 
user experience innovation around competitor solutions are as follows: 
1. 
Identify potential solutions from a competitor product. 
2. 
Categorize competitor solutions. 
3. 
Innovate solutions. 
4. 
Verify solutions. 
Anecdote 
In the beginning of the mobile phone era, phones were most often operated using 
keypad buttons for each of the functions. Some devices used a function key that, 
when pressed at the same time as a digit key, would bring up a menu or execute a 
function (just like a shortcut on your computer). These devices were highly complex 
to use. 
There were a few user experience pioneers, though, who invented the use of soft 
keys for mobile phones. You may be thinking Nokia, but that is wrong. The first mo-
bile phones with soft keys came from either Siemens or Cetelco/Hagenuk. Even I am 
not sure who gets the real credit for the initial innovation, and I have worked with 
both companies. But it was for sure not Nokia. Nokia launched its first soft key–
enabled device (the 2110) in 1994 and it was a big success, even though the first 
devices with soft keys came out in 1992. Figure 14-1 shows the Hagenuk MT 900. 
Even at that time, the soft key concept was wasn’t new. It existed for some very 
technical devices, such as oscilloscopes, but Siemens and Cetelco/Hagenuk were 
the first to bring it to the mobile phone market.  

Copying with Pride 
 
138 
Even though Nokia was not the biggest mobile phone manufacturer at that time (it 
was number 3 after Motorola and Ericsson), it managed with the 2110 and its fol-
lowing products to make users and the industry believe that the soft key concept 
was invented by Nokia. Remember that history rarely remembers those who were 
first to do something; it usually remembers those who were first to do it right. (Ad-
mittedly, the fact that the Nokia 2110 was half the size and weight of the 
Cetelco/Hagenuk device probably had an influence here also.)

Step 1: Identify Potential Solutions from a  
Competitor Product 
Identifying solutions from competitors takes some practice. Obvious great innova-
tions are easy to spot, but sometimes you will also want to identify small and maybe 
hidden solutions that are easy to overlook. You also want to find solutions that may 
not make sense at first glance, but if used in another context may be really innova-
tive. In the following sections, I will elaborate on how you can find solutions from 
competitor products. 

User Experience Innovation 
139 
Use Competitors’ Products 
Many designers and engineers tend to mainly use the products of their own com-
pany. If you are designing mobile devices, you might even be requested by the man-
agement to use only products from the company. 
This is a big mistake. If you want to learn about competition, you should use its 
products. If you are designing a word processor, you should try to use a competing 
product for at least one or two months. If you are designing a website, you should 
follow the trends and improvements that your competition is following. 
Finding user experience innovation is sometimes very easy (e.g., a new and in-
novative method to scroll a menu), and other times it may be quite tricky. Maybe 
you notice a small function in a calendar application that can become very useful if 
applied to a messaging application. Maybe you see a function in a piece of word-
processing software that will make a lot of sense on your website. 
Twisting these competitor ideas take a bit of practice as well. Which is why 
using competitor products should be a must for everyone related to innovation in 
the company. If you work at a company or organization that wants to invest in fu-
ture user experience innovation, you should start allowing and encouraging your 
employees to use competitor products. 
Competitor Intelligence 
Larger companies may have specific teams or functions to look at what the competi-
tion is up to. This can make sense as long as competitor intelligence is also part of 
the innovation process.  
In my opinion, competitor intelligence and teardown should be things that 
everyone in the company is involved in. Of course, you can certainly centralize 
some of the work of gathering and compiling data, and you can also centralize the 
purchase of competitor products. 
The reason for actually using competing products is simple: you need to try 
functions, applications, and features yourself to see where potential successful user 
experience innovations may be hidden. 
LCD TV Example 
In this chapter, I will assume that you are designing an LCD TV. In such a case, 
you might choose to list solutions from a single competitor or brand. Figure 14-2 
shows an example of documenting solutions for a specific competitor LCD TV. 
The solutions cover features, applications, design, and other potential elements of 
the  product. 

Copying with Pride 
 
140 
 
Figure 14-2. Example of potential solutions found on competitor LCD TV 
Step 2: Categorize Competitor Solutions 
The first thing you want to do with the solutions you have found in the competitor 
product(s) is to categorize them. You can, for example, try to identify which solutions 
solve a core task, whether the competitor solutions have pain points, and so on. I 
chose to distinguish between the following four categories of competitor solutions: 
• 
Solutions that cover core tasks but are hidden 
• 
Solutions that cover core tasks but have moderate or serious 
pain points 
• 
Solutions that aren’t part of a core task but have nice visual de-
sign 
• 
Solutions that aren’t part of a core task but have some interest-
ing interaction elements 
Depending on the nature of your product, you may need more categories, but 
determining whether the solution covers a user need (core task) is essential. 
Step 3: Innovate Solutions 
You are now ready to start innovating user experience solutions based on the cate-
gories of the identified solutions from your competitor device. Following are some 
ways to innovate for different categories of solution. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
141 
Solutions That Cover Core Tasks but Are Hidden 
Figure 14-3 illustrates a hidden function in a competing product. In this case, your 
innovation process is straightforward. The function is a core function that you have 
identified as a core task. The competitor has maybe created a brilliant solution for a 
core task, and the only thing you need to do is adapt it to your product and make it 
visible. However, in many cases the solution may not be directly applicable to your 
product, or you may need to be concerned about copyrights. 
So, no matter how brilliant the solution of your competitor is, you will still want 
to innovate around the solution just as if it was a core task that you just identified. 
Doing so may very likely give you a solution that is even better than that of your 
competitor.  
 
Figure 14-3. Hidden competitor core tasks marked with black 
In the LCD TV example, the following solutions were identified to belong to this 
category: 
• 
Hidden function to store all channels: Saving TV channels is a 
core task when it comes to the first use of the product, and 
when TV stations are added or removed. The teardown of the 
competitor TV revealed a pretty intelligent autostore function, 
but it was hidden away in a very illogical way.  
• 
Previous channel key on remote: Switching between two chan-
nels is a core task for many TV viewers, but the placement and 
icon used in the competitor product was difficult to under-
stand. 

Copying with Pride 
 
142 
The initial step could be to simply copy the functions and make them more 
visible for the TV that you are designing, but as mentioned it may make a lot of 
sense to use some of the previously discussed methods for innovation around core 
tasks also. 
Following I will list a few examples of how a competitor solution can spawn 
new and innovative user experience ideas: 
• 
Hidden function to store all channels: 
• 
You may choose to store channels in the user’s language in the 
first channel locations. This can be achieved by detecting the 
country code transmitted for (some) TV channels and pairing 
this with the selected menu language. 
• 
You can store channels according to the number displayed in 
the TV station logo by using the powerful image-processing 
abilities of the LCD TV.  
• 
You can capture and store the logo for each channel (typically 
shown in upper-right corner of the TV screen) and use this in 
other core functions (e.g., the channel overview menu). 
• 
You can detect the actual sound of the TV station and interpret 
the language being spoken on it. This will require some proc-
essing and language detection software, but it’s doable. 
• 
Previous channel key on remote: 
• 
You can allow the user to easily swap between two or more 
channels. 
• 
You can bring up an onscreen menu allowing the user to 
switch between the five most recently visited channels. 
• 
You can offer a new key on the remote control that allows the 
user to switch between the five most watched TV channels 
(based on the total time spent watching each TV channel). 
Solutions That Cover Core Tasks but Have Moderate 
or Serious Pain Points 
Figure 14-4 highlights some solutions that cover core tasks, but are implemented in 
ways that bring pain to the user. Solutions in this category may cover core tasks that 
you overlooked in your user interviews or research. They might be potential future 
core tasks in your product.

Figure 14-4. Competitor core tasks with pain points marked with black background 
If you can identify a potential future core task, you have a good chance at creat-
ing a successful user experience innovation. In the LCD TV example, the following 
solutions were categorized as core tasks with serious pain points: 
• 
Handle on box for carrying: Carrying a large LCD TV is a main 
pain point for many users. The competitor TV was equipped 
with a handle that was very sharp and small. 
• 
Earphone plug on front: The competitor chose to place the 
earphone plug on the front of the TV, which ruined the visual 
experience. 
Again, the easy approach could be to simply copy the solutions while fixing the 
pain points; or you can—as I recommend—choose to create further user experience 
innovation around these pain points, as described in Chapter 9. If you use these 
methods, you may, for example, come up with these additional solutions: 
• 
Handle on box for carrying: 
• 
You can mount a large handle or even two handles on the box, 
making it possible for two people to carry the TV. 
• 
You can add two small, cheap wheels on the bottom of the box, 
and a handle on the top by which to pull the TV behind you. 
• 
Earphone plug on front: 
• 
You can hide the earphone plug behind a small, nicely de-
signed panel.  

Copying with Pride 
 
144 
• 
You can place a USB port and/or a card reader behind the 
panel so that the user can look at photos or similar on the TV.  
• 
If you are designing a high-end TV, you can consider letting 
the panel open electronically when the user moves a hand in 
front of it. 
• 
You can add lighting around each of the connectors and make 
this element a part of the visual design of your TV. This will 
also allow the user to find the plugs in darkness. 
Solutions That Aren’t Part of a Core Task but Have 
Nice Visual Design 
Figure 14-5 shows a function that is not part of performing a core task, but that rep-
resents an attractive visual design element. Functions like this may catch your at-
tention—for example, a menu that scrolls in an elegant way, a device that has some 
tasteful split lines, or a good-looking solution for a display frame.  
The competitor is—luckily—not using these solutions for core tasks, and hence 
these most likely will not become successful user experience innovations for the 
competitor. You can look at the basic ideas, redesign them, and apply them to some 
of the core tasks of your own device. 
You may also want to innovate further around the idea. For this purpose, you can 
use the previously described innovation method for technologies (if the visual ele-
ment is driven by, e.g., a new method for scrolling) or for applications (if the identified 
solution on the competitor device can be characterized as an application). 
In the LCD TV example, let us assume that this solution was identified only on the 
competitor’s sound menu. If you really like this concept from your competitors, you 
may now want to bring it to all of your onscreen menus. Or you can innovate around 
this technology and, for example, come up with the following additional ideas: 
• 
You can allow the user to personalize the colors of the menu 
(e.g., by allowing the user to select different themes). You 
should design a transparent theme also, since this is a solution 
that many users will need (if you have ever tried entering a 
menu to fix something when the spouse or kids are watching 
their favorite program, you will know about this need). 
 
 

User Experience Innovation 
 
145 
 
Figure 14-5. A solution that’s not part of a core task, but has a nice design  
• 
As a spin-off idea, you may want to allow the user to personalize 
the subtitles. With digital TV reception, the subtitles are received 
as text strings, and hence it is up to the TV to display the subti-
tles in an adequate way. So why not allow a visually impaired 
person to see subtitles in a very large font? Why not allow other 
users to use fully transparent subtitles? Why not allow users to 
adapt the background color to match the furniture? For some 
users (e.g., the visually impaired), these may represent core 
tasks, but for others they may not. But these solutions could 
possibly trigger some positive surprises or wow. 
• 
As a further spin-off, you may allow the user to store and later 
use the subtitles. 
Solutions That Aren’t Part of a Core Task but Have 
Some Interesting Interaction Elements 
Figure 14-6 shows a solution that is a nice idea but doesn’t really cover a user need. 
Other such examples might include the handling of the scrolling from one page to 
the next, the text-entry method, and the keypad layout. 
This is the situation where you identify other nonvisual but interesting user ex-
perience design elements in a competitor’s product. The solution on the competitor 
device is not a part of a core task, so this gives you the chance to take the solution, 

Copying with Pride 
 
146 
redesign it, create further innovations, and then apply those to one or more core 
tasks in your own device. 
In this case you would most likely use the technology and core task innovation 
methods described earlier. You can view the interaction element as a technology 
and find suitable applications to add it to, but you also need to be very focused on 
applying the solution to your core tasks. 
In the case of the LCD TV, the easy-sorting-of-channels solution has been put 
in this category. Sorting channels should not be a core task for the end users if 
you’ve designed your channel-autostoring features correctly, but in many TVs today 
it still is. 
 
Figure 14-6. A solution that doesn’t cover a user need, but is still a nice idea 
The solution in the competitor product allows users to first mark one channel 
to move, after which the user can specify where to place the marked channel. The 
competitor’s solution allows the user to insert a channel between two other chan-
nels. Your current solution allows only the swapping of channels, which has been 
identified as a pain point since it makes it very cumbersome to organize the list, as 
the user always ends up having to move a channel other than the one desired. 
In this case the obvious solution is to copy your competitor’s handling. You 
may want to improve the handling by visually indicating that the user is inserting 
the channel in between two other channels. 
If you, for example, use the technology innovation method described in this 
book, you may also come up with other places where you can apply similar han-
dling. If you are using the method described for core tasks, you might invent new 

User Experience Innovation 
 
147 
user experience solutions, such as marking multiple channels for moving at the 
same time. Or you might use a more visual and maybe two-dimensional method for 
moving channels around—for example, using a screenshot from the TV station or 
the TV station logo as the icon for each channel. 
Step 4: Verify Solutions 
When you have found suitable twists on competitor solutions, you will need to 
verify these, as described in more detail in Chapter 18. You will want to make sure 
that you are covering true end-user needs, that you have not created pain points, 
and that your solution is highly usable.  
Concerns 
When you are twisting and improving solutions, you want to make sure that you are 
not infringing on any intellectual property rights. Avoid blindly copying any competi-
tor technologies (including, e.g., visual design), as this may violate copyrights.  
If you insist on, for example, using a patented solution, you can sometimes find 
workarounds to avoid infringing on the patent. Many patents involving user interac-
tion are defined very narrowly, and you may be able to create a solution that does 
not infringe on the rights (and is even better than the original). 
Note that you cannot create a patent for a generic solution to a problem—only 
for a specific method to perform a certain task or to achieve a certain goal. If you 
focus on looking at what problem a specific feature of a competitor is solving, and 
then design your own approach to solve this problem, you will rarely infringe on any 
copyrights or patents. 
And of course, you can purchase a license for a specific patent if you really want 
to use the specific methods covered by the patent.  
Summary 
As indicated in this chapter, you can successfully copy ideas from your competition, 
or from other products in other industries. This chapter has also covered how to 
apply different innovation methods depending on the characteristics of the solution 
you have found in the competitor product. 
When you use these methods for copying, you will automatically learn about 
twisting solutions and creating innovations for your own products. Copying solu-
tions from your competitors is nothing to be ashamed of. Every company does, 
sometimes even without knowing it.  
As mentioned, it’s important to look to improve upon solutions that your com-
petitors just haven’t gotten right. These are low-hanging fruit. However, you can 
also innovate further around the solutions of your competitors, which will likely 
allow you to come up with other successful user experience innovations. 

Copying with Pride 
 
148 
One can argue that it is not true innovation if you copy an idea from an existing 
product, redesign it, and start marketing it. However, if magazines, analysts, and 
consumers perceive it as innovation, then it is. And it may well turn out to be a 
successful one.

Innovating Around  
Paradoxes 
Looking at paradoxes is another excellent method for creating user experience in-
novation. If you, for example, see the need for security on your website as essential 
among your target users, but you are at the same time dealing with target users who 
have a profound need for simplicity, this may be a paradox that you would like to 
focus on. The need for both simplicity and security is a common paradox. Following 
are some general examples of paradoxes you might encounter: 
•
If you a designing video-editing software, users will often de-
mand more functionality, but they will also suffer from an in-
creased number of functions. 
•
If you are designing a device for physically challenged people 
who at the same time want a modern-looking product, you 
may be faced with a paradox. 
•
Users may have a need to know where they are, but at the 
same time not desire that other people know where they are. 
•
Your news website may be funded primarily by banner com-
mercials, but the end users mainly want to read the news. 
Paradoxes can be caused by conflicting user needs, or they can be inherent in 
technologies or applications. Paradoxes can also come from poor organizational or 
business structure. The method for innovation around paradoxes is as follows: 
1.
Identify paradoxes. 
2.
Innovate solutions around paradoxes. 
3.
Document and verify solutions. 

Innovating Around Paradoxes

Anecdote 
Some years ago, we at Nokia were looking at how to create a contact list for users 
who did not want other people to see certain contacts. Protecting some or all con-
tacts with a password was too cumbersome and a pain point for the target users. 
This paradox made us think of different and simpler solutions, and the innovation 
turned into a patent that was later rewarded by Nokia with an extraordinary inven-
tion prize.1 
The solution was to allow the user to mark contact entries as hidden. These con-
tacts would then not show up when scrolling the contacts list. However, if the user 
used the search function and specifically typed a certain number of characters of 
the hidden name, then the contact entry would show up. The paradox turned from a 
potential pain point into a simple but true user experience innovation.  
Step 1: Identify Paradoxes 
The best paradoxes for user experience innovation are paradoxes caused by con-
flicting user needs, conflicting core tasks, or pain points. The reason why these ele-
ments are good for user experience innovation is that they inherently contain the 
user needs of the target users, and hence they will give a good chance for finding 
user experience innovation covering a real user need. 
In this chapter, I will use a piece of video-editing software as the example pro-
duct. The product is intended for nontechnical people who have a need for a simple 
tool to create short movies based on still photos and maybe a few video clips. The 
process of identifying the target users, their needs, and the core tasks has revealed 
the paradoxes shown in Figure 15-1.

Step 2: Innovate Solutions Around Paradoxes 
You are now ready for innovating around your paradoxes. You can use the previ-
ously created drawing with your paradoxes as a starting point. I will use the para-
doxes from Figure 15-1 as examples to work from. 
Begin by inviting colleagues and maybe some lead users to a small workshop. 
There you can brainstorm to find solutions for your paradoxes. The work is not easy. 
But bring the right group together and create the right atmosphere. You will be 
sometimes be surprised at the creativity that results. 
Innovating around paradoxes is about seeing the paradox as a challenge. The 
solutions will very much depend on the type of paradox you’re dealing with. Follow-
ing I have given some guidance for solutions to paradoxes that are common. 
Simplicity vs. Functionality 
Simplicity vs. functionality (Figure 15-2) is a classical paradox that most products 
have. It is probably the most profound paradox in products.   
 

Innovating Around Paradoxes 
 
152 
 
Figure 15-2. Classical user experience paradox: Simplicity vs. functionality 
If your paradox is that your target users want something to be very simple and 
at the same time they want hundreds or thousands of features, then you may need 
to look at methods for making your core tasks very simple but hiding advanced and 
less used options deeper into the system.  
• 
For a remote control, you would want to put solutions for core 
tasks on dedicated keys, but hide solutions for less important 
tasks in onscreen menus.  
• 
If you are designing a mobile device, you can choose to have 
functions related to core tasks directly accessible from a soft 
key or touch screen, but hide other functions in deeper menus. 
• 
If you are designing a word processor, video-editing software, 
web page creation software, or similar, you might provide 
templates that are easy to understand but give the user a 
chance to use more advanced features.  
• 
You might choose to displace more advanced functions, as de-
scribed in Chapter 12. For example, if you are designing a de-
vice, you might choose to move more complex functions to 
another platform where these functions can be created with a 
good user experience (e.g., through PC software).  
• 
You might profile specific users to find out their needs, and 
then hide unnecessary information and functions from them 
as needed.  
Sometimes a good approach is simply limiting the functionality of your pro-
duct to what 90 percent of your users will use. Yes, you will get complaints from 
some advanced users, but if the overall user experience is improved, this may be an 
option.  
For the video-editing software used in this example, you might want to provide 
a simple step-by-step method for converting an entire folder of photos into a movie 
using different templates.  

User Experience Innovation

Anecdote 
When I got my first iPod from Apple many years back, I often found myself wanting 
to change the music track information that had been labeled incorrectly (e.g., a mis-
spelled artist or a wrong title). I knew that I could change the information on my PC 
through iTunes, but it annoyed me a little bit that I could not do it on the device. 
In this case, Apple made a choice for me, which I personally—as a pretty tech-
savvy user—did not appreciate. But I realized that I was not an average user. Apple 
decided—I guess deliberately—to displace the complexity to the PC platform. 
Mismatch Between Need and Actual Usage 
If your identified paradox is about functionality that the users claim to desire and 
need, but that they do not use, you may have a problem with the user experience for 
that functionality. This is a very common paradox. Maybe you have hidden a poten-
tial core task too much or maybe your solution for accomplishing this core task is 
simply not optimal.  
In other words, you have a pain point. In this case, you may want to refer to 
Chapter 9 and review the process for innovating around painpoints. 
Relying on Other Products for Core Tasks 
Another common paradox is that your entire user experience depends on other 
products to perform some of the core tasks of your product. This paradox is hence 
created by your ecosystem. 
If you are designing a mobile phone, you may be dependent on network infra-
structure, as well as complex user settings to allow the user to access the Internet. If 
you are designing video-editing software, you may depend on complex third-party 
software to allow the user to burn a DVD. 
In these cases you want to remove or reduce the dependence on other pro-
ducts. You need to find workarounds or dedicated solutions to solve this paradox. If 
you are designing a mobile device, you may for instance want to preload settings for 
every mobile phone operator in the world to ensure that the user can immediately 
access the Internet. 
If your users are unfamiliar with specific third-party solutions that they cur-
rently need to use external products for, you will probably want to integrate simple 
solutions for these into your products. If you, for example, design video-editing 
software, you may choose to integrate a simple and easy-to-use DVD-burning ap-
plication into your software.  
Multiple Target User Groups with Conflicting Needs 
Another classical paradox comes from conflicting needs for your different target 
user groups. In some cases this is because you have defined your target users in the 

Innovating Around Paradoxes 
 
154 
wrong way, and you may need to reduce your focus to fewer target users. In other 
cases, this situation is less simple.  
Imagine that you have designed a mobile phone for young, low-income users in 
entry markets, but it ends up selling very well among elderly people in mature mar-
kets who have conflicting needs. In this case you can of course choose to remove the 
device from your sales channels to mature markets, but doing so will just give you 
less profit. A better solution may be to create variants of your product to suit the 
different user needs. Or you can design a new, optimized, similarly sized and priced 
product for the elderly in mature markets. 
In some cases you may also be able to resolve conflicting needs from different 
target users inside the same product. You can, for example, apply different user 
experiences depending on the profile of the user. You can use an adaptive user 
interface, which will optimize the interaction for your different user needs. Or you 
can allow users to choose different profiles based on their specific needs and re-
quirements. 
Business Structure vs. End-User Needs 
Another classical paradox involves conflicting requirements between business 
needs and user needs. Your business may, for example, require that the web page 
you are designing be plastered with banner commercials, but this may be in direct 
conflict with the end-user needs. Another example would be designing a smart 
phone where you want to expand usage of Internet and download services, but 
where doing so may be in initial conflict with the users’ need for simplicity.  
In such situations you may need to look at solutions that satisfy both sets of 
conflicting requirements. This can be very challenging, and there will be compro-
mises. But if you manage to find solutions that satisfy both business needs and end 
users, then you may well be able to design a successful user experience innovation. 
What you first want to ensure is that the user experience does not suffer too 
much. If you are designing a web page and your banner commercials make users 
leave your web page quickly, then you will lose your customers and your business. 
Maybe you can place banner commercials in certain areas where the user experi-
ence will not suffer too much. Maybe you can design intelligence into your web 
page so that banner commercials will be relevant to the user in a given situation. 
This will not only make users visit the page more frequently, but it may also add 
value for the user. 
 
Anecdote 
Google search is a good example of intelligent placement of commercials. The 
commercials almost always depend on the search string that the user has typed. 
The amount of ads is limited in the actual search results and hence doesn’t reduce 
the overall user experience too much. In fact, the ads may even be of benefit to the 
user experience, if the user actually wants to click on one of the listed ad links. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
155 
If you are designing a piece of video-editing software where you want to invite 
users to purchase the product, you will need to first get people hooked on your pro-
duct. This can be done by offering enough functionality in the shareware version, 
and of course by having a great overall user experience of your product. But it can 
also be done by giving the user small, free samples of what the purchased version 
can offer. Just make sure not to create pain points. 
Video Conversion Software Example 
In our video conversion software example, the result of generating solutions for the 
paradoxes may look as shown in  Figure 15-3. 
 
Figure 15-3. Result of innovation around paradoxes in the video-editing software 
example 
Step 3: Document and Verify Solutions  
As with all previously described user experience innovation methods, you again 
need to document and verify your solutions. For further details on verification, 
please refer to Chapter 18.  

Innovating Around Paradoxes 
 
156 
Summary 
As mentioned, you will use user needs, core tasks, and pain points actively in the 
process of innovating solutions for paradoxes. But the approach you choose will 
depend on the nature of your paradox and your product.  
In this chapter I have shown you tangible methods to solve what might seem 
like inherent problems in your product—paradoxes—for creating potentially suc-
cessful user experience innovation. 
Solving paradoxes may seem like an impossible task, but it can also be seen as a 
real goldmine for potential innovation. If you solve some or all of your paradoxes, 
your product will improve considerably and you may even reach more target user 
groups with your product.

Innovating Around  
Context Awareness 
Context awareness is the ability for a device, system, or web page to know the con-
text that the user (or the product) is in. In several ways, context awareness can be 
seen as a separate technology that enables the product to detect things like where 
the user is, what time it is, what level of experience the user has, what the user has 
done before, what interests the user has, what the user may do next, and even what 
mood the user is in. Context awareness can be achieved by using technologies like 
GPS, IP address identification, user action history, sensors, timing devices, ques-
tionnaires, and similar. 
Even though context awareness is “just” a technology, it is also a great source of 
user experience innovation. By knowing your user and the situation or mood he is 
in, you can provide a much more optimized user experience. You can tailor the so-
lutions for the needs of the specific user, or even to the different needs of a particu-
lar user at a given time.  
You can identify the general needs of your target users before designing the 
product, but with context awareness you can potentially detect which needs the 
user has right now. You may even be able to guess the tasks he is about to accom-
plish and the desires he has, also right now.  
Context awareness can create positive surprises and wow, since you may be 
able to design a product that knows what the user wants.  
However, context awareness requires a fine balance. Many users do not to like 
to be surveyed and monitored, since this touches on human needs about feeling 
safe and secure. Also, many users do not like when your product makes a bad guess 
and suggests something wrong. 
The specific steps for creating innovation around context awareness are: 
1. 
Identify target user needs. 
2. 
Identify current sensing capabilities. 
3. 
Innovate context awareness. 
4. 
Document your results and verify solutions. 
The approach for innovating using context awareness is similar to the process 
for innovation around technologies. In this chapter I will use the example of a rela-
tively young family father (Figure 16-1) in a mature market. The product will be a 
modern car that has a number of sensing capabilities built in. 

Innovating Around Context Awareness 
 
158 
 
Figure 16-1. Car target user example: family father 
Step 1: Identify Target User Needs 
As always, you need to identify the needs of the target users, as already described in 
previous chapters. In the case of a car targeted for family fathers in mature markets, 
the needs could look as shown in Figure 16-2.  
 
Figure 16-2. Example of user needs for young family fathers buying cars in developed 
markets 

User Experience Innovation 
159 
Step 2: Identify Current Sensing Capabilities  
The next step is to list what your product is currently—or potentially—able to iden-
tify about the user, where the user is, and what the user typically does with your 
product. You want to list all the obvious sensor inputs that you already have (such 
as the location of the user, time of the day, date, other programs running at the 
same time, etc.), but you also want to list other elements that could potentially tell 
you more about the user and the context she is in right now. For example: 
•
If you are designing a smart phone, the phone will know the 
exact time, which country the device is in, and maybe even the 
exact location of the phone.  
•
If you are designing a washing machine, the machine may over 
time learn which programs are typically used. 
•
If you are designing a mobile phone or a website, your product 
may over time learn which functions the user is typically using, 
as well as when the functions are used. 
•
If you are designing a social website, you may detect the typi-
cal usage pattern of a specific user. 
At this stage, it is OK to list only the technologies or sensors available on the de-
vice that could potentially detect any contextual information. 
For the car example, the result could look like that in Figure 16-3. I am here as-
suming that the car is already equipped with a number of sensors that are already 
common in modern cars. 
Figure 16-3. Current context awareness abilities for the car example 

Innovating Around Context Awareness 
 
160 
Step 3: Innovate Context Awareness Abilities 
The next step is to innovate potential abilities from the current contextual informa-
tion that you can gather about your user. You will want to combine this information 
with user needs, and how a user spends his or her typical day.  
Context-aware user experience innovation is very much about looking at exist-
ing knowledge about user behavior and needs, and then combining it with the in-
sights and information that you already have about the user. It is also about identi-
fying new potential information that you can gather using the existing sensing abili-
ties that your product already has.  
Since finding current context-aware capabilities of your product is in itself an 
innovation task, you want at this stage to gather a small team of cross-functional 
colleagues and ideally some lead users for a session. What you are looking for in this 
innovation session is new contextual information about the user that can be de-
duced from your existing sensors and insights. 
You will want to look at the combination of current user needs, existing know-
ledge of your users, and the technologies at hand in order to guess what the user 
may want to do. This combination will become your starting point for the user ex-
perience innovation process. 
If you are, for example, designing a washing machine, you may from consumer 
insights (or from previous usage) know that your target users will often want to fill up 
and prepare the washing machine in the morning before they go to work. You may 
from a specific user’s usage pattern know that the user typically sets the delay timer 
to six hours on Mondays, five hours on Fridays, and so on. And hence you already 
have a valuable insight about the specific user. You have in other words found con-
text awareness information that you can use for user experience innovation. 
If you are designing a smart phone, you may know that your typical users 
commute to work in the morning. Motion sensors or the microphone may be able 
to detect whether the user is sitting on a train, on a bus, or in a car. Hence, combin-
ing information that you already know about the target users with actual contex-
tual information from sensors may give you information that a given user is now 
most likely on his way to work. If the user is using a built-in GPS to find his way to 
work, you can actually be sure of where he is going. And you can then use this in-
formation to optimize the user experience, or even come up with further user ex-
perience innovations. 
If you are designing a social website, and you trace what a specific user typically 
does at a specific time of the day when logging in, you can over time learn about the 
most desired functions that this user performs at a given time of the day or week. 
Combining this with insights about who the user is may give you very valuable start-
ing points for further user experience innovation. 
If you are designing a low-end mobile phone, and market research shows that 
most target users charge their phone at night and use their phone as an alarm clock, 
you may have an insight that can help you predict when a user wants to define a 
new alarm (e.g., by proposing to define a new alarm when the charging plug is in-
serted at night time).  

User Experience Innovation 
 
161 
In the case of the car used as an example in this chapter, you can try to combine 
a number of existing insights about the user with the possible information that you 
can gather about the specific user (where he is, who he is, what time it is, etc.). A 
tangible method is to use the target user needs as the basis for this task. You may 
also want to add other potential insights that you have about your users (e.g., from 
day-in-the-life sessions, market feedback, etc.). 
To keep this example simple, I used only the target user needs, and then I cre-
ated a drawing that combines these with the sensing inputs, as shown in Figure 
16-4. 
 
Figure 16-4. Drawing combining user needs and sensing abilities 
Anecdote 
One of the technologies I patented, together with my former ideation colleague Peter 
Dam Nielsen, automatically suggests to a user that they should set the alarm clock 
on their mobile device when plugging the device into a charger. Of course, the rec-
ommended alarm setting would be partly derived from the time of day and based on 
the previous usage pattern of the specific user (patent number WO2009077848).  
Peter’s and my idea is a small but intelligent example of using contextual informa-
tion, where you combine consumer insights with a few simple sensors. In our case, 
we combined inputs from the built-in clock and the sensor detecting when a charger 
was plugged in, and we combined those inputs with the user’s past pattern of be-
havior. The result is an example of using information about the user’s previous pat-
terns—both using general user insights and the current context of the user.

Innovating Around Context Awareness 
 
162 
Now you are ready—in an innovation session—to combine what you know 
about the target users (family fathers in mature markets) and the sensing capabili-
ties. You also want to be creative and, for example, invite lead users to your session. 
In this session you are free to combine all the knowledge about what could be de-
tected about the user and his or her context. You want to combine this with known 
user needs and see what ideas it brings up.  
In the case of the car for family fathers, you might look at ways to detect who is 
currently the driver. You might also want to look at ways to make the target user 
more confident in the car (e.g., enabling parking assistance, auto-braking when a 
car in front is stopping, etc.). And you might even be able to provide assistance if a 
car is coming very quickly from behind. Finally, you may want to use the car’s cam-
eras to detect street signs.  
The results of brainstorming in such an session might look something like Fig-
ure 16-5. 
 
Figure 16-5. Example of user experience innovation around context awareness 
As you can see from this example, using context awareness combined with 
knowledge about the target users can give you a number of insights and innova-
tions. 
Anecdote 
The 2011 Ford Focus is unique because it has a large number of user experience 
innovations, and the car sells well based on these innovations. For example, the 
steering wheel vibrates when the driver changes lanes, the car can park automati-
cally, it can identify and display current speed limits and other restrictions by using  
a camera facing the front, and it can brake automatically if a car is stopping ahead 
of you. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
163 
These user experience innovations may not be new, but they have never been of-
fered in a car at this price before. And the great thing is that these innovations do 
not cost a fortune to implement.  
As mentioned before, user experience innovations do not have to be new, but if they 
are relevant to the user and are applied to the right product, they may very likely be 
seen as true innovations. 
Step 4: Document Your Results and Verify  
Solutions 
As with any user experience innovation, you will want to document your innova-
tions and  verify them with end users. Chapter 18 talks about how to do that. 
Concerns  
As with many other methods described in this book, context awareness innovation 
has potential drawbacks. One key drawback is the risk of creating pain points. If you 
are guessing what the user wants in a certain situation, you will naturally be wrong in 
some cases. This can partially be solved by discreetly inviting the user to do things 
based on context awareness, rather than performing the functions automatically. If 
you, for example, choose to automatically change the mode of your mobile phone to 
silent based on contextual information, you may very easily create a serious pain 
point when your product makes a wrong guess. If you instead propose this option to 
the user, the risk is smaller, and it allows the user to stay in control. 
Allowing the user to remain in control is another concern in context-aware user 
experience solutions. For example, you would certainly not want your car to brake 
in a situation where there is no real danger. Many users prefer to stay fully in control 
of what they do and about how much their product knows about them. 
The control issue is similar to that in a personal relationship. For example, if 
you have a friend who frequently suggests solutions to problems for you, it may be 
acceptable. But if you meet a new person who tries to guess too quickly what you 
want or need, you will most likely reject this person, regardless of whether they’re 
actually right. 
So when designing context-aware user experience solutions, you have to be 
very sensitive about intimacy. For example, users may trust a close friend with the 
knowledge that they use a dating website, but they may not want a product to know 
this. In some cases, users may start thinking that your product is sharing their in-
formation with other people, commercial websites, and so on. And then that sharing 
becomes a pain point; at least in the mind of the user. 
Be careful with context awareness. Use the method thoughtfully. Keep privacy 
and control matters in mind. Do all these things right, and you can be extremely 
successful.

Anecdote 
When I first managed to get a company car—an Audi A4—I went to the car wash 
after about two weeks. I drove the car into the automated car wash, switched off the 
engine and then checked that all windows were closed. I then opened the door, left 
the car, and started the car wash from the outside. 
When I came back to the car, I noticed that the car window on the driver’s side was 
half open. And when I entered the car, there was a pool of water on the floor, the car 
seat was soaking wet, and there was water dripping from the roof. 
I ended up driving around on a cold Munich night with the heat turned up full blast 
and the windows open to get the steam out. I could see people looking at my car 
since steam came out of the windows. 
Only the next day, after testing for several hours to learn how the car and window 
system worked, did I conclude what had happened. Audi had created a design in 
which the electric windows would still work after the engine was turned off, and 
they would also work until the driver door was closed. The reason for that design 
was probably to allow users to close any windows if they forgot after turning off the 
engine. So when I opened the door in the car wash, I must have accidentally 
pressed the button for opening the window (and yes, the button was “conveniently”  
placed next to the door handle). The car had a function to fully open the windows 
when the key was just pressed once, and the window must have then stopped half-
way when the car detected that I closed the door again. 
This story is an example of not keeping the user in control—and it is also a brilliant 
example of how a function designed to create positive surprises can become a seri-
ous pain point. 
Summary 
As you have learned, context awareness can be a great source for user experience 
innovation. Many products already today contain a number of sensing technolo-
gies, not least mobile phones and smart phones, and it is likely that these technolo-
gies could become available also in other device types. Using the methods described 
in this chapter, you may be able to create successful user experience innovations for 
your product.

Innovating Around New 
Products and Users 
The previous chapters educated you on tangible methods for identifying or defining 
target users, identifying user needs, and creating innovation around technologies, 
applications, pain points, core tasks, and a number of other elements. Without even 
knowing it, you may now be a user experience innovator. This applies especially if you 
have tried several of the previously described methods in practice already. 
Becoming a successful user experience innovator is about trying things out. 
Reading will give you knowledge and ideas about how to solve problems, but trying 
things will give you skills and experience. Every time you try out the described meth-
ods, or your own variants of the methods, you will learn new things—as well as new 
methods. So try the methods out and discover what works for you.  
Learning to Design for Great User Experience 
In this chapter I will combine most of the methods you have learned so far to de-
scribe how to create successful user experience innovations for an existing product 
or a product targeted for new target users. With most of the previous methods, I as-
sumed that you already had a more or less fixed product that you needed to create 
successful user experience innovations for. In this chapter, we will assume that the 
product you are designing is much more open when it comes to supported target 
users, technologies, applications, and—if a device—form factors, keypad layout, dis-
play size, and so forth. In practice, you will almost never be in a situation where you 
have the freedom to design just any new product. The most common scenario is that 
you need to design a product that is similar to the products that your company is 
already designing, but with a new group of target users. Here are some examples: 
• 
Your company already has a social website for young users, 
and your task is to design a social website for mature users or 
people with special interests. 
• 
Your company already has success with a TV set designed for 
most users, and your task is to create an optimized TV specifi-
cally for teenagers.  
• 
Your company designs washing machines, and your new task 
is to design the user experience for a tumble dryer. 

Innovating Around New Products and Users 
 
166 
• 
Your company is a mobile device manufacturer, and your task 
is to design a smart phone for a new target user group (e.g., 
teenagers or mature users). 
Figure 17-1 shows the overall steps that may be needed for creating successful 
user experience innovation for a product for new target users. 
In most situations you will in this case need to start the user experience innova-
tion process from the beginning. And you will certainly need to find out more about 
your new target users as the first step.

tasks for a product for new target users 
Steps Needed to Design for Successful User 
Experience  
When designing a product for new target users or a new type of product, you’ll need 
to go through almost all the previously described methods in this book. I have 
changed the order of the steps to optimize the design process for a new product and 
a product with a new target user group. Here are the steps: 
1. 
Identify or define your target users. 
2. 
Identify target user needs. 
3. 
Find and prioritize core tasks for new target users. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
167 
4. 
Identify key core tasks. 
5. 
Design and innovate basic user experience elements. 
6. 
Identify and design needed technologies. 
7. 
Identify applications and innovate. 
8. 
Design your product. 
In this chapter I will go through all the steps listed above. However, I’ll refer-
ence previous chapters to avoid repeating myself too much. 
This chapter’s example will look at designing the basics of a touch-enabled mo-
bile device targeted for mature adults in developed markets. The initial product, 
shown in Figure 17-2, is hence intentionally left almost blank, since the assumption 
is that we’re designing this product more or less from scratch. But two things are 
fixed: the target group and the touch screen technology.  
 
Figure 17-2. Touch-enabled mobile device for mature adults in developed markets 
Let us assume that the decision for targeting mature adults with a touch-driven 
mobile device comes from thorough market research indicating that mature adults 
in developed markets have a high disposable income, and that they will also likely 
purchase a device with a large touch display. It is also assumed that this target group 
is likely to start slowly adopting this touch technology. 
Step 1: Identify or Define Your Target Users 
Identifying or defining a target user group is essential for any innovation around 
user experience. This applies when designing new products. Chapter 3 talks about 
how to identify a target group, so refer to that if you need a refresher. 
Often, your target user group will already be defined, based on, for example, 
market research and market insights. But even if this is the case, you will still want 
to interview target users to find their needs and potential core tasks for your pro-
duct. In the mobile device example, the target user group has already been identi-
fied as mature adults in developed markets. 

Innovating Around New Products and Users 
 
168 
Step 2: Identify Target User Needs 
The next—and probably most essential—thing you want to do is get into the heads 
of your target users. Before starting any design or innovation, you need to know 
much more about who the target users are and what their needs are. In particular, 
you want to know what their needs are for the type of product you are designing. 
Identifying user needs can be achieved through market research, interviews, or 
some of the other methods described in Chapter 4. In the example of a touch device 
for mature adults, let us assume that you have identified as the most essential user 
needs those shown in Figure 17-3. 
 
Figure 17-3. User needs identified for touch-driven mobile devices for mature adults 
Step 3: Find and Prioritize Core Tasks for New Target 
Users 
When designing a new product—or when optimizing an existing product for other 
target users—it is equally important to identify the core tasks of your user group. 
Chapter 5 talks about the importance of core tasks and gives a method for identify-
ing them. 
When I described methods for identifying core tasks in Chapter 5, I focused on 
getting information from your existing users (interviewing, measuring, web surveys, 
etc.). But how do you find the core tasks for a target user group that is not yet using 
your product? How do you find core tasks for a product that maybe does not even 
exist yet? 

User Experience Innovation 
169 
It is in fact not that difficult to identify core tasks for a product not yet in use or 
existence. You simply need to find a number of representatives from the target user 
group and interview them about their expectations on what they may use in your 
product.  
When you prepare your interviews, you will use the target user needs actively. 
You can, for example, based on the user needs, create a list of potential core tasks in 
advance. Do not limit that list of tasks to assumed available technologies and appli-
cations on the device. If there is a user need for certain functionality that requires 
new hardware or applications, you should list tasks related to this as well. You may 
also want to look at potential competitor products to see which core tasks they solve 
and which could be relevant for your target users. 
Each of the tasks you come up with should be specific enough to allow creating 
innovations around them later on. However, asking a user to prioritize 100 or more 
tasks will most likely produce an unreliable result, so you may also want to combine 
small core tasks into larger, more overall tasks. For example, driving a car is an over-
all task consisting of numerous, more granular tasks such as steering, accelerating, 
braking, and so forth. 
 Note  If you really insist on having hundreds of tasks prioritized by target users—or if 
your product requires this—then you can choose to split the tasks into two or more groups, 
and simply give different users different core tasks to prioritize. But keep in mind that very 
few products in this world have hundreds of potential core tasks, so try to restrict yourself 
based on common sense. 
You can then ask the target users to categorize each of the core tasks that you 
have prepared; for example, you can ask the target users to rate each potential task 
by putting it in a different category (e.g., Very Important, Important, Less Important, 
Not Important, etc.). Remember to allow target users to also add their own tasks 
during this exercise, since you may have overlooked potentially important tasks for 
your product when preparing for the interview.  
Figure 17-4 shows how this exercise might turn out with the target users in the 
touch mobile device example. (The list hasn’t been verified with actual mature tar-
get users; it serves purely as an example in this book.) 

Innovating Around New Products and Users 
 
170 
 
Figure 17-4. Example of prioritizing core tasks in the mobile device example 
Sometimes when you find your core tasks, you may realize that the product you 
are designing may be over the top for the tasks at hand. This may lead you to radi-
cally reconsider whether you are designing the right type of product. Is it, for exam-
ple, worth designing a relatively expensive touch-enabled mobile device if the core 
tasks for the target users are basic call handling, alarm clock functionality, and re-
plying to messages?  
However, it may not be as simple as creating what you feel is the right type of 
product. The target users may actually desire an over-the-top product anyway, even 
though their core tasks are limited. In the case of the touch display, the target users 
may desire such a product based on general market trends, and you should thus try 
to create a superb user experience for the core tasks within the given product scope. 
Step 4: Identify Key Core Tasks 
In the initial design of your product, you will primarily focus on your top core tasks. 
This will ensure that the product you design is really targeted to your customers and 
not compromised by lower-priority tasks. 
Depending on the product, you might have between one and ten top core tasks. 
Having more tasks may mean that you’ll lose focus or that you have defined your 
target user group to be too broad. 
For the touch-enabled mobile device for mature adults, the top core task list 
could as an example look like that shown in Figure 17-5. 
 
 

User Experience Innovation 
 
171 
 
Figure 17-5. Example of top eight core tasks identified for the touch-enabled device 
for mature adults 
Step 5: Design and Innovate Basic User Experience 
Elements 
The next step is to design the basic user experience of your product. Chapter 6 cov-
ers how to do this with respect to innovating around core tasks. 
If you are designing a web page, you want to innovate guidelines for the visual 
style of your product, as well as the basic user experience elements for the page 
(menu style, whether to include drop-down lists, security, etc.). You also want at this 
stage to create a basic layout or wireframe of your web page. This is done by using 
the top core tasks, as well as general insights involving the needs of the target users.  
If you are designing a device, you also want to design the basic physical input 
and output elements, such as the keypad, touch interaction principles, display, 
LEDs, vibration feedback, and so on. 
There may be several solutions for solving each of the tasks, and you may need 
to prototype a number of different solutions and verify them with users until you 
have found a suitable solution. The process is similar to that described in Chapter 6, 
except that this time you do not have any existing solutions for your core tasks yet.  
You will need to take each top core task one by one, and work through it in a 
workshop within a cross-functional team, and potentially with lead users. Focus in 
each workshop on creating an innovative user experience to solve the core task at 
hand. During these user experience innovation sessions, you can use competitor 
products as inspiration, you can use copying, you can focus on wows and positive 
surprises, and you can look at the ecosystem and the first impression.  
Figure 17-6 shows how the result of an innovation session for a single top core 
task could look for the touch-enabled mobile device. 

Innovating Around New Products and Users 
 
172 
 
Figure 17-6. Example of user experience innovation around a single key core task 
For each core task, you should easily find a number of solutions, and you 
should do some initial prototyping of each of these solutions. Create working proto-
types, paper prototypes, Flash animations, videos, mechanical mock-ups or what-
ever else works for you.  
The format of your prototype depends on the nature of your product, your solu-
tion, and the target users. Generally, there is no reason to overdo prototypes at this 
stage of product creation. However, it is important that the target users fully under-
stand and relate to your solution when they see your prototype during the verification 
later. The main goal is to ideally create multiple prototypes of solutions for  
each of the key core tasks, which can then be evaluated with target users.  
 Note  Prototyping and verification is described further in Chapter 18. 
I want to emphasise that in this step it is important to focus very much on target 
user needs and key core tasks. A common mistake is to more or less reuse an exist-
ing product and then simply add a few functions for the new target user group. 
Doing so will very seldom give successful user experience innovations. Another mis-
take is to try to use too many core tasks when designing the product. The key goal of 
this part of the process is to create a product optimized for the target users and their 
top core tasks.  
Verification of the concepts with target users is essential at this stage, since you 
can save a lot of time if you can filter out wrong ideas. You can use multiple solutions 
and prototypes for each core task, thereby giving users the possibility of choosing 
from multiple solutions. In some cases, you may find that several of your solutions 

User Experience Innovation 
 
173 
are suitable and could provide successful user experience innovations. In such cases, 
you may need to prioritize based on, for example, cost and capability, if you do not 
want to offer all solutions.  
It may in some cases be an advantage to have multiple solutions for the same 
core task to satisfy different user needs and different usage situations. However, 
creating too many different solutions for the same core task may easily result in cre-
ating pain points or a product that has too many options for performing the same 
task. So this specific situation is a balancing act. 
In some cases when verifying your solutions with target users, you may find  
that none of your solutions are really optimal, even if some of your solutions may 
have some good elements. This is where an iterative approach is essential. You will 
basically go back and redo your innovation sessions again, of course using the find-
ings from your first verification rounds. How many iterations you need depends on 
the nature of your product, on the quality of your previous innovation sessions, and 
on how well you have identified your target user needs and core tasks. 
In the example of the mobile device for mature users, I will assume that a num-
ber of iterations of innovation sessions, prototyping, and user verifications have led 
to the basic interaction elements for the mobile device shown in Figure 17-7. 
 
Figure 17-7. Example of basic interaction elements identified for the touch mobile 
device  
Step 6: Identify and Design Needed Technologies 
After you have a basic user experience structure in place, you are ready to innovate 
the user experience around the technologies that you have already planned for 
your product and those that you may need to add to satisfy the target user needs. 
Use the approach in Chapter 7 for innovating around technologies that you already 
plan to use. Begin with the core tasks to help in identifying new potential technolo-
gies that you may need to add to your web page, system, or device. 

Innovating Around New Products and Users 
 
174 
If you are designing a web page for new target users, and you have identified 
that these users have a core task that involves protecting their data, you should con-
sider focusing on easy-to-use and innovative password and login technologies. If 
your users have a core task of finding products easily on your web page, you should 
consider investing in or developing good product search algorithms that fit those 
target users. 
If you are designing a touch-enabled mobile device for mature users and these 
users have core tasks such as listening to the radio and watching TV, then you 
should seriously consider adding radio and TV receiver technology to your device. 
Whether you choose to support TV using technologies like DVB-H or DVB-T, or 
whether you simply design great user experience solutions for Internet streaming of 
TV will depend on your ecosystem, the market requirements, and the regional target 
user needs. Figure 17-8 shows how an icon to support TV might look on our mobile 
device. 
 
Figure 17-8. Technology for TV added for the mobile device example 
If the users of your touch-enabled mobile device have a profound need to get 
tactile feedback when using your touch device, you can consider adding dedicated 
dome-based keys. Or you can add tactility (virtual or physical) to your touch device. 
Figure 17-9 shows one possible method of adding feedback to a touch panel. 
 
Figure 17-9. Touch pad with mechanical movement and click functionality 

User Experience Innovation 
 
175 
You will certainly want to verify the technologies with target users. You should 
also innovate around each technology as described in Chapter 7. 
Anecdote 
Tactility for touch-operated smart phones may be a true need for a number of users 
(e.g., mature users or users using the device while, for example, walking). Some ex-
isting solutions for achieving tactility include vibrating feedback. 
During my time at Nokia, we invented a mechanism for which the touch area is de-
pressed when touched, similar to a normal dome-based key. Providing a touch area 
that actually moves downward when pressed not only offers brilliant tactility, but 
lends a new dimension to touch pads. It allows the user to distinguish between 
touching the display gently and actually pressing the display, which can allow for a 
number of potentially successful user experience innovations.  
Gently touching the display could e.g. zoom the area you are about to select, and 
depressing the display could actually select the item1 This concept was later used in 
a slightly different implementation by RIM in its SurePress Touch Screen technology 
applied to its BlackBerry Storm device. 
Step 7: Identify Applications and Innovate  
The next step is to identify the applications of your product. This time you may want 
to look not only at the top core tasks for your target users, but also at lower-priority 
core tasks. You will hence—based on the target user needs and core tasks—create a 
list of the applications that your product should contain.  
Even though the core tasks are the focus in this step, it is vital also keep the tar-
get users and their user needs in mind. If “making calls to friends” is identified as a 
core task, then many designers might automatically say, “We can use the call-
handling and contact list functionality from our previous product designed for 
business users.” This may not, however, be suitable for the needs of the new group 
of target users. 
If you are designing an electronic car key, you might limit your applications to 
opening doors, closing doors, and starting the engine. If you also identify the lower-
priority core task of opening the trunk, you might consider adding that as an appli-
cation as well. 
For more complex products, the list of applications might be longer, but you 
should try to avoid the common mistake of simply filling your product with all ap-
plications that any potential user might like to use. So, it is important to follow the 
core tasks identified for the target users. However, there may be regulations or 
standards that need to be followed, which may require adding further applications.

176 
When the applications have been identified, it is essential to verify the list of 
with target users. You should also use the previously described method from Chap-
ter 8 to create successful user experiences around applications. 
Going through all the steps and applications needed for the touch-enabled mo-
bile device would be too much to do in this book, but Figure 17-10 shows how an 
extract of the results might look. 
 
Figure 17-10. Shortened application list for the touch-enabled mobile device for 
mature users 
Step 8: Design Your Product 
When you have the list of applications for your product, you are ready to start de-
signing your product. It will be too extensive to describe all the needed steps here, 
but you will certainly use many if not all of the methods described earlier in this 
book. You should, for example, look at the first impression of your product, inno-
vate around the ecosystem, and create wows and positive surprises. You should also 
try to foresee pain points and create successful user experiences around these. 
The key message for this part of the process is to always keep the target users, 
their needs, and their core tasks in mind. It is easy during this part of the process to 
get carried away and design applications and elements that you would like yourself, 
rather than things that the target users want. 
Another important thing to emphasize for the design process is involving target 
users as much as you can. Involving users does not have to mean performing exten-
sive, cumbersome, and expensive usability tests; it can simply mean calling target 
users that you already have been in contact with, and maybe dropping them an e-
mail or visiting them to present new ideas. 
Involving users at a very early stage may save you a lot of time later, since you 
can avoid creating finalized designs of functionality that the users may not want at 
all. It will also ensure that the user experience of your product is optimal.

Summary 
This chapter has shown you how to use the processes described in previous chap-
ters to actually create a new product for new target users. During this process, it’s 
important to keep focus on the target user needs and core tasks. Also, by keeping 
the target users in the loop throughout the process, you will have a good chance of 
creating a successful user experience for your product.

Prototyping and  
Verifying Solutions 
In the previous chapters I emphasized the need for verifying user experience inno-
vations, and I emphasized the need to verify your core tasks, your pain points, and 
your wows.  
One common mistake with verification is almost finishing your design and only 
then verifying your solutions. In this book I have mentioned a number of methods 
to verify not only solutions, but also raw ideas, core tasks, causes of pain points, and 
so forth. It is of utmost importance that you verify at every step during your innova-
tion process. And you will have to do this with your target users. No one else can 
verify for you, and if you end up on the wrong track for a solution, you may waste 
valuable time and resources. 
The good thing is that verification is not difficult at all. The trick with verification 
is to verify your results from the innovation process at all stages. Verification may be 
less accurate at an early stage of the innovation, but it is always better to do some 
verification up front and get a fuzzy picture that you can refine later than to do no 
verification at all and head in a completely wrong direction. 
For example, if you come up with a wrong cause for a serious pain point and 
you do not verify the cause, you may go a very long way down the innovation path 
before realizing this mistake. And you will not only have used a lot of time and re-
sources designing a solution for something that the end user may not need, but you 
will also have missed the opportunity to solve the real cause of your pain point. 
You can find a huge amount of literature and a number of articles about differ-
ent methods for verifying your results and innovations, so in this chapter I will go 
through only the methods that I know are very effective. Depending on what you are 
verifying, the steps may vary slightly, but you will usually need to follow the steps 
described in the following sections. 
Prototyping 
Prototyping may sound like creating fully functional implementations of your 
ideas and thoughts, but in this sense it covers any method that visualizes or de-
scribes an idea.  
 

Prototyping and Verifying Solutions 
180 
Here are some examples: 
• 
If you want to verify a pain point, you might as the prototype 
simply take a photo of a person experiencing the pain point 
and discuss this photo with the user. You might also have the 
user experience the pain point on your existing product and 
witness their reactions, hereby simply using your existing pro-
duct as a prototype.  
• 
If you want to verify core tasks, you might as prototype use 
multiple photos or illustrations in a cartoon-like manner. Or 
you might create a small video using your colleagues as actors. 
• 
If you want to verify solutions, you might create simulations or 
simple paper prototypes. 
If you feel that prototyping a specific solution is complex, then it is most likely 
because your solution is too complex, and you may want to look at the user experi-
ence of your solution again. 
In the following sections, I will go through some easy and effective ways to cre-
ate prototypes. 
Photos and Illustrations 
If you want to verify a certain core task or pain point, using simple photos is a very 
easy and effective method. In some situations you may have the need to manipulate 
the photo to emphasize the situation. 
If you want to create a prototype of a device or a screenshot, you can use 
handmade sketches, simple drawing tools, or a presentation program. Figure 18-1 
shows some of the prototypes that I created for this book (the total creation time 
was around one hour). I cannot sketch or use Photoshop well, so my preferred tool 
is Microsoft PowerPoint. Are these prototypes perfect? No, and they should not be, 
since trying to make them perfect will waste time at an early stage of the innovation 
process. What is important is that the prototype tells the story that you are trying to 
tell the users. And that is a key element when, for example, approaching users with 
your early user experience innovation ideas. My proposal is that you use the tools 
that you feel comfortable with and that allow you to create prototypes quickly. If 
you are good at making sketches by hand or with graphics tools, then use these 
methods. If you can create great prototypes with clay or LEGO bricks, feel free. The 
trick is not to be fixed to a single tool or set of tools. Limiting yourself will often just 
deter you from what you really want to achieve: telling the user about your concept, 
a pain point, or a feature.

Cartoons and Storyboards 
If you want to verify core tasks, solutions, positive surprises, or pain points, you 
might use small storyboards with situations that you either draw yourself or assem-
ble using photos. These stories can be used to describe specific situations and prob-
lems, as well as potential solutions.

Flash Videos and Simulations 
If you want to verify solutions that have several interaction elements or are very 
visual, you may want to create a short Flash video or an interactive Flash simulation. 
Some people can create extremely powerful Flash videos and interactive simula-
tions in almost no time. This approach can be very useful for verifying basic con-
cepts for your web page, device, or similar. 
Videos 
Creating videos using your colleagues as actors (Figure 18-2) can be a quick and 
easy way to create prototypes explaining pain points, core tasks, user needs, or even 
solutions and ideas. 
 
Figure 18-2. Video prototyping 
Paper Prototypes 
Simple paper prototypes can be very effective for testing interaction flows. Paper 
prototypes can be very simple hand drawings, screenshots, or illustrations that you 
have  created.  

User Experience Innovation 
 
183 
Verification  
When you have created your prototype, you will need to verify it with target users. 
When you want to learn about target users—for example, to learn about their core 
tasks or pain points—you will of course need to approach them in some way. There 
already exists extensive literature on how to verify innovations and achieve insights 
from target users, but in the following sections I will briefly introduce some meth-
ods that I have myself used with success. 
User Interviews 
Much verification can be done by interviewing target users. You can do this on the 
street, in their homes via e-mail, or by phone. Face-to-face meetings in the user’s 
natural environment usually give the best results. 
If you are trying to find or verify user needs, you may use professional inter-
viewers for your task, but with some practice you may quickly learn to do it yourself. 
To verify core tasks, pain points, and so on, you want to present the users with con-
crete examples of the tasks or pain points using prototypes. 
Market Research 
Market research is good for finding and verifying target users and end-user needs. 
Verifying core tasks and solutions may also be possible using market research, but 
usually interviews or usability tests are better for these. 
Usability Tests 
Usability tests are useful for verifying solutions and ideas that are pretty mature and 
for which you can present the user with paper prototypes, simulations, or similar. 
Usability tests may be very relevant if testing an application or technology that is 
almost finalized. 
When performing usability tests, you will mostly focus on the new application 
or element that you’ve designed, but you can also use additional findings that the 
usability tests may reveal (e.g., for identifying potential future needs, overlooked 
core tasks, or pain points). 
Lead User Workshops 
Lead user workshops are ideal not only for revealing user needs, core tasks, and pain 
points, but also for actually innovating new user experience elements. Chapter 13 of 
this book goes into detail on this type of workshop.

Summary 
In this short chapter I have given you some ideas on how to prototype your solutions 
and ideas. I have also described how you can verify solutions without using huge 
amounts of resources. Remember to prototype and verify at different—or ideally 
all—stages along the way in your product development process. Don’t wait until the 
very end, when you have a fully designed product, only to find out that you’ve gone a 
long way down the wrong path.

Meeting Organizational  
Challenges 
User experience specialists and innovators seem to face the same problems no mat-
ter what type of organization they’re in. In small companies, you will need to face 
the owner(s), who will often tell you that user experience innovation is a waste of 
time, and the company should rather focus on bringing new technologies or pro-
ducts to the market. In large corporations, you may feel squeezed between software 
and other engineers who say that it will take a very long time to implement your 
innovation, and that they are busy creating new technologies required for the next 
range of products. 
In my (nonstatistical) mind, I guess that in more than 90 percent of companies 
and organizations in this world, user experience experts, innovators, and designers 
often feel overlooked and underappreciated. This is why I chose to include this chap-
ter, which hopefully will give you, as a person with a focus on user experiences, some 
ammunition and methods to use in your specific company or organization. 
In my belief, user experience innovation will become the battleground in al-
most all consumer businesses within a few years. So why are companies and orga-
nizations so reluctant to embrace this new winning approach? 
For one, reluctance to change and stubbornness (Figure 19-1) inside your orga-
nization may be a key factor (even if this stubbornness may leave your company 
obsolete). 
 
Figure 19-1. Stubbornness is often a key reason for not focusing on user experience 
innovation. 

Meeting Organizational Challenges 
 
186 
In the following sections, I will go through some of the typical problems that 
you may face in organizations of all sizes when trying to pitch your user experience 
innovations. And I will propose some methods that may—or may not—work in your 
situation and organization. 
Technology vs. User Experience 
One typical problem is that technology is seen as more important than the user ex-
perience. Maybe you are working at a company where you are the only one who 
cares about the user experience, or where the group of people focusing on user ex-
perience is often overlooked. Other times you as user experience designer may be 
reduced to perform usability tests of the final product. You may personally be trying 
hard to make the rest of the organization see how important a good user experience 
is. But in many businesses, user experience still is not valued or seen as a competi-
tive element.  
I still see devices—for example, in the medical industry that require weeks of 
training, but why waste a doctor’s time on training if the problem could be solved 
with an improved user experience? I still see cars that have absolutely unintuitive 
interaction panels. When did all car drivers have to become engineers to operate 
their vehicles?  
There are many reasons why devices, software, and systems in certain in-
dustries are designed to be difficult to use. But most of the time there’s no need for 
this to be the case. For instance, in the medical business you may need to comply 
with very strict standards, but these standards very rarely relate to the user experi-
ence. And I have never in my life seen any standard saying that a certain product has 
to be difficult to use. Not even if the product is operated by a surgeon during a sur-
gery. And would you want a surgeon to have to look in a manual many times during 
a surgery (Figure 19-2) to check how to operate a specific device? I have never seen a 
standard saying that a certain product should require two or more weeks of training 
before it can be used. 
 
Figure 19-2. Sorry, I need to look at the manual to see how to use this device. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
187 
The problem is often resistance in certain parts of the organization and with the 
management. The argument is often, “Our competitors make even more complex 
products.” And maybe your company is even earning more money on training peo-
ple how to use the device than on the device itself. 
Resistance to creating good user experience is certainly a challenge for you as a 
user experience expert and/or innovator. But there are solutions, as described in 
previous chapters of this book. 
The “I Know What the Users Want” Attitude 
It is amazing how many people in your organization actually think that they know 
exactly what people want, and how a product should be designed. I am in no way 
saying that a user experience expert always knows best how to create a great pro-
duct; I am just saying that when it comes to the user experience, you will be con-
fronted with a very large number of people who will tell you that they know better. 
I usually compare user experience with bringing up a child. Many people have 
tried bringing up a child once or twice, and hence they feel like experts in child psy-
chology. These people will argue with experts in the area because they feel that they 
have the same expertise as, say, a teacher, educator, child psychologist, and so forth. 
Sales managers typically know a lot about how customers react to a certain 
product, but do they really know what the users want? They typically know all about 
what the customers do not want, and also what the users tell them they want. This is 
very valuable information, but it does not necessarily tell anything about latent 
needs and what consumers may in reality be looking for.  
Salespeople are also rarely innovative. They tend to stick to a solution that a 
single (important) customer has asked for. They are rarely able to see what a ma-
jority of users would want—and being creative is not part of their job description. Of 
course there are exceptions, and I have seen quite a few. This is not an attempt to 
blame salespeople (or CEOs for that matter), but rather to say that priorities are 
often different in different parts of your company. 
Likewise, product managers often tend to solely look at what is easily market-
able. This is very important, indeed, but product managers may not see underlying 
needs that can actually create a truly great and cool product. My impression of pro-
duct managers is that they are really good at focusing on a single function or feature 
for a product, because they can already see how this feature can be used in market-
ing campaigns. But product  managers often lack the capacity to see the potential if 
you instead create 20 small user experience improvements to the product. In my 
experience, 20 small improvements to the user experience of a product may some-
times have a much bigger effect in the market than a single new feature. And these 
improvements can even be marketed if done right. And it may be your task to ex-
plain and rectify this to the product manager. 
Engineers and engineering managers typically know what is easy to implement, 
and hence their minds will often be skewed toward solutions that are easy to im-
plement. This can be challenging to tackle, and you will sometimes need to under-
stand the challenges that they have in finding solutions that are easier to implement 
but that still give the same user experience.  

Meeting Organizational Challenges 
 
188 
Ignorance 
Ignorance and lack of knowledge are other typical reasons why you may have big 
challenges getting through with your user experience knowledge and innovations. I 
have previously argued that user experience will become the main battleground for 
all future innovation, but this is not commonly accepted in most companies and 
organizations. 
Especially in smaller organizations, you will often feel alone in your views. Do 
not become desperate, though. It is not easy to change an organization that is not 
used to getting inputs from a person who claims to know more about what the cus-
tomers want; I have basically lived my professional life in this state for 18 years.  
Getting Lost in Big Organizations 
I have personally experienced being lost in large organizations and organizational 
structures. The CEO and everyone in upper management typically want to get pro-
ducts on the market as quickly as possible. CEOs will typically be business educated, 
so they may think that any product will do. You, on the other hand, know that the 
product will not be successful in the market if certain user experience innovations are 
not implemented. And you personally know that without these elements, the com-
pany may end up with a product that users and analysts will see as being mediocre.  
Solutions and Methods 
As mentioned, I have been a user experience innovator in both small and large 
companies. And in both situations, it can be very challenging to make your voice 
heard. At the upper levels in many companies, it is all about numbers, quotas, and 
deadlines. In other parts of the company, it may be about satisfying a single cus-
tomer. But in my humble mind, this is all a mistake. If you want to improve your 
numbers, then you need to improve your products. And in current markets (espe-
cially for consumer-oriented products), user experience is slowly but surely becom-
ing a key differentiator. In other words, if you do not focus on user experience, the 
numbers and deadlines may no longer be relevant at all. 
Following I will go through some solutions to the above challenges faced by 
user experience innovators. But keep in mind that they are not bulletproof. How-
ever, I hope that you at least get some inspiration about what you can do. Every or-
ganization and company is different, and some methods may work in one company 
but not others. However, I have compiled the methods that I personally feel have 
worked best. 
Use Customer Insights 
You will find yourself in a number of situations with numerous people who say 
that they know more about what the customers want than you do. You may be 
submissive, which will get you nowhere. Alternatively, you should use your in-
sights about what the users and customers actually want. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
189 
There may be other parts of your organization that know about the custom-
ers—for example, people involved with market research functions. In this case, you 
will want to try to team up with your market research people. 
Arguing from a customer insights point of view is a very strong method to get 
your ideas and opinions through. There are very few organizations and companies 
in this world that will officially say that they do not listen to the consumers. So what 
you will often experience is that people will listen when you can reliably say that 80 
percent of the users have problems using this or that function in your product, or 
when you say that 50 percent of users have a need to do this or that with your pro-
duct, and so on. So you will certainly need numbers to make your point. But you 
may not necessarily need extensive statistical data. If you can verify that, for exam-
ple, three out of five users had serious problems using a specific part of your pro-
duct, that may be enough to make your point. This will depend on the stubbornness 
of your organization. So use your insights, and use your data. This may even con-
vince the most stubborn people in your organization. 
Invite People to Workshops 
Inviting people in your organization to user experience innovation workshops may 
be a very effective way to basically teach people in the organization how to keep the 
customers in focus. You may also want to invite lead users to some of the work-
shops, thereby combining direct user feedback with the methods and approaches 
for creating user experience innovations. 
Workshops also have the wonderful advantage that almost all people attending 
them will see the ideas that came up as their own, and hence give more traction 
inside the organization to actually implement the ideas in your product. Workshops 
often also offer a very successful method to train people in thinking like a user ex-
perience expert or innovator. 
It is important when organizing user experience innovation workshops to make 
them different from the normal meetings that the people in your company have (see 
Figure 19-3). I have personally seen many meetings in large corporations where 
people read and write e-mails all the way through the meeting, unless their favorite 
topic comes up. 
You want to make your user experience workshops very different. Have the 
workshop in a park, inside a customer’s house, or in some other interesting lo-
cation. Invite real users to the workshop to loosen up the people joining the work-
shop. It is amazing how one comment from a single real customer can change the 
mind of even the most stubborn people in your organization. They can reject your 
point of view, but they will (hopefully) never reject the opinion of a user.   
Try to approach the scope of the workshop in a unique and interesting way. 
For example, I have seen user experience innovation workshops held as Bingo 
sessions, where the participants needed to come up with enough ideas or core 
tasks to fill a card, I have seen workshops where the main scope was to build 
prototypes with LEGO bricks, and I have seen meetings held in unusual settings, 
such as a museum.  
 

Meeting Organizational Challenges 
190 
Figure 19-3. Find alternative ways to hold your user experience workshops. 
In other words, try to stand out, not only to make your workshop participants 
get away from their daily routines, but also to make them think differently. It is  
OK to stand out, because as a user experience innovator you are already seen as 
different. 
Create Cross-Functional Teams 
If you are so lucky that you are able to create a cross-functional user experience 
team, then you have a very good chance of breaking the barriers in your organiza-
tion. Cross-functional teams can create truly innovative user experience solutions 
that are detached from normal company thinking. Maybe your team will find me-
chanical or electrical solutions to a software problem. Or maybe your team of algor-
ithm experts will find a genuine solution to create a truly new user experience. Or 
maybe your market research team has identified a unique user need that no one 
else in the market is currently covering. 
Being cross-functional or multidisciplinary may vary depending on the nature 
of your product and organization—for example, at a web-design company, looking 
at mechanical solutions may not be relevant. But then you can bring in people 
from different levels of software development, from marketing, and even from 
management.  
If you are not lucky enough to be able to create an isolated user experience in-
novation team with multiple disciplines, there is still hope. You can basically create 
the cross-functional team on a per-need basis, and you can invite these people for 
specific workshops. Most companies today allow each employee to take part in 
meetings and workshops that do not relate directly to their expert area. And you will 
actually find that these people will often love to join such workshops. 
Isolated and dedicated user experience innovation teams may become a po-
tential problem, however, since they can be seen by the rest of the organization as 
an unapproachable ivory tower. This can be avoided by assuring that the team 

User Experience Innovation 
 
191 
members are involved also with ongoing product development, by frequent rota-
tion of people into the team etc. 
In sum, if you are the only user experience expert and innovator at a small 
company, you should invite people from other disciplines to your workshops. This 
will not only give you valuable insights, but it will also slowly direct your company 
and the organization to be more focused on user needs and the potential innova-
tions hidden there. 
Provide Examples from Competition 
Another approach to convincing your organization about the need to focus on user 
experience innovation is by providing good examples. You may want to use exam-
ples from your direct competitors—for example, in cases where they have success-
fully gained market share due to better user experience (similar to how I’ve used the 
example of the Apple iPhone several times in this book to describe how successful 
user experience innovation can be created). Your product and business may be dif-
ferent, so find your own good examples among your competition. 
So, use your competitors, and for that matter other businesses, to make your 
point, and to convince the people in your organization that changes are needed. 
Do Internal Marketing 
Internal marketing of user experience innovations cannot be emphasized enough, 
whether you’re working at a very large organization or a small company. To be suc-
cessful in internal marketing of what user experience innovation can do for your 
product or business area, you will again need data from real users. This data may tell 
you that your current product is extremely difficult to use, or it may show that your 
customers prefer another product. All this data will be useful. 
You may also want to set up meetings with upper management to tell about why 
it is important to focus on the user experience, where you basically teach them about 
user experience and user experience innovation. In this case, you will want to have 
concrete data about why your company may be losing ground to competitors, and 
how the (lack of) user experience innovation is contributing to this. If you can even 
dig up some financial data about what value it would have if you focused more on 
user experience, so much the better. But putting a figure on the value of user experi-
ence is generally difficult. 
Deliver Great Ideas and Prototypes 
Bringing truly valuable ideas into your company or organization is probably one of 
the most effective methods of changing the attitudes about user experience innova-
tion in your company.  
Again, I would use user data to approach this challenge, and, for example, use 
some of the many methods already described in this book. Give management the 
true story about how the users see your current product. Tell the story about what 
your users really want, based on facts, insights, user tests, and so on. 

Meeting Organizational Challenges 
 
192 
You will also want to show your user experience innovation ideas with proto-
types, be it with animated PowerPoint slides, Flash animations, prototypes, or 
similar. 
Let Decision-Makers Participate in Usability Tests 
Another approach to convincing people in your organization about the value of user 
experience is to invite people to usability tests. A usability test is a great way to con-
vince people in organizations where user experience is not yet valued at all. Seeing 
real users struggle with your current product is a good eye-opener for people who 
believe that they know how the products are seen by users. 
Conduct Street Interviews 
I have already mentioned street interviews as a method for getting quick insights 
into the user needs and desires. Street interviews (Figure 19-4) are also good for 
changing the attitude in an organization toward user experience. Letting people 
from your organization stand face to face with your customers can be eye-opening 
for almost everyone within your organization. 
 
Figure 19-4. Street interview example 
Street interviews may apply to certain types of products, especially consumer 
products, but they may be trickier for technical products for which you may not 
likely meet your customers on the street. In this case, you may want to invite people 
in your organization to people’s homes, to their workplaces, and so on. If you are, 
for example, designing products used during surgery, then invite people to a real 
surgery. 

User Experience Innovation 
 
193 
Involve Yourself in Specific Products 
I have myself very successfully used this method. One of the best ways to show what 
you can contribute to for a specific product is to actually contribute to that product. 
The project manager who ensures on-time delivery of your product may not be your 
first point of contact, because they may see you as a person who suggests innova-
tions that may take time and resources to implement. You might instead go to a 
product manager or some other person with a customer or user focus. This could be 
a product manager or a software chief with a sincere belief in creating a great pro-
duct. This will depend on your organization and company, of course. 
What you want to do in this case is propose tangible and highly marketable so-
lutions, based of course on the methods described in this book.  
You may need to compromise many times during this process, but your main 
goal is to get more and more people accepting and respecting what you can bring to 
the product. And the method is—as described a bit earlier—to suggest tangible solu-
tions that may make the specificproduct great. 
Teach Internally  
Internal teaching is seldom a success, unless, as described previously, you use very 
good examples from your consumer insights, from pain points you’ve identified, 
and from competition. In my experience, the people who would voluntarily go to a 
teaching session on user experience and user experience innovation are few—or 
they may already be part of the niche group of people inside your company who 
have already seen the light. So, my suggestion in most cases is to rather try to sell 
your teaching as something else. You may use phrases such as how to tackle our 
strong competition or bringing the company back onto the profit track. Yes, this 
sounds like marketing-speak, and admittedly, it is. But successful user experience 
innovation may be extremely important for your company in the very near future, 
so why not sell it like that? There’s no need to be too academic and use dull phras-
ings such as user experiences are important for future products. 
In my mind, too many user experience experts and innovators make the classic 
mistake of being academic and claiming that user experience is complex. I disagree 
with this. User experience innovation is not academic, and it is certainly not some-
thing that only a few select companies in the world cancan  do. 
Summary 
In this chapter, I have explained some of the many challenges that you will meet 
inside your company or organization when you propose your great and maybe suc-
cessful user experience innovations. There is no easy way to do this, and I have per-
sonally worked for many years to make the need for user experience innovation 
heard in the companies that I have worked for. 
We did, however, eventually manage to bring together one of the first multidis-
ciplinary teams at Nokia, where my innovation capabilities managed to flourish. 
Before that I worked directly with product managers, engineers, and even CEOs for 
several years to push my messages through—often with success, but also many

194 
times without. I have managed to put my user experience fingerprints on a large 
number of specific products, and often on a case-to-case basis, simply by delivering 
good user experience innovation and design, with good backup from user insights 
and user data. 
I have been behind a large number of user experience innovations launched in 
products, and I have seen innovations become successful when there was a true user 
need. I’ve also seen some of my innovations quickly become forgotten. But what has 
always driven my passion is a desire to meet a single customer who tells me how great 
a function that I designed works—and a desire to see millions of users using a func-
tion that I designed. And it is exactly this passion that is the most important element 
for facing organizational challenges, stubbornness, and so forth. 
In other words, I’m not saying that this part is easy, and I’m not saying that there’s 
one single solution, but I do think that great ideas and the right approaches to user 
experience will flourish in almost any organization. But it requires some work and 
selling.  
 
 

 
 
Conclusion 
I hope that you have found inspiration in many of the methods I have described in 
this book. User experience innovation will become the battleground in almost all 
consumer businesses within a few years. It has happened widely already within the 
web page design area, it has happened within the mobile phone area, and it will also 
happen in industries such as those involving washing machines, stereo and other 
music systems, remote controls, cars, and so forth. Customers will start to expect 
and demand reasonable user experiences for any product they purchase. 
User experience innovation (especially for consumer-focused products) is 
nothing less than essential for survival! No company, be it a car manufacturer, a 
washing machine manufacturer, a social website company, or a mobile device 
manufacturer, will survive without focusing on user experience.  
Consider Nokia. Nokia led the mobile industry for more than a decade—mainly 
due to a consistent flow of user experience improvements and innovations. Yet in 
only a few years’ time, Nokia’s position in the market dropped significantly, especially 
in the profitable smart phone sector, which is now controlled largely by Apple and 
Android-based products. Why the sudden drop in fortune? It was largely due to the 
lack of good user experience in Nokia’s product line. 
You will see the same trend repeat in other markets very soon. The world is 
changing. Customers, users, and people will demand and expect superior user ex-
periences, and they will choose the products they purchase based on this. The 
change will come first in consumer-oriented products, but it will extend to profes-
sional-use products as well. If your company or organization is not currently look-
ing into user experience innovations, you may already be too late. Focus on user 
experience innovation now. 
User experience innovation is essential. Apple and Google have shown how to 
attack companies that were ruling the industry. They have won simply by applying 
relevant, novel, visible, and marketable user experience solutions and innovations 
to the market. 
I will not claim that the methods described in this book are perfect, since per-
fect methods do not exist. But I can say that these methods have helped me person-
ally to create more than 100 filed patents. They have helped me to create a number 
of truly successful user experience innovations for Nokia when Nokia was still seen 
as one of the top ten most innovative companies in the world. Begin trying out the 
methods, and over time you may adapt the methods for your specific product, or 
you may come up with your own additional methods or variants. 
As an ending remark, I would like to emphasize three things that can help you 
create successful user experience innovation.  

Conclusion 
 
196 
First is to involve the users. Find ways to involve users without spending a lot of 
time and money, and use existing insights and methods already available in your 
company. And find a way to involve your target users at every step of the iterative 
process—from getting input to verifying your solutions at all steps of the iterative 
innovation process. 
The second thing is to focus on making your target users happy, or even make 
them fall in love with your product. Fixing small pain points in applications that are 
never used is a waste of time, so focus your efforts on making your core tasks and 
first impressions great. If you achieve those things, you will likely end up with a suc-
cessful user experience. 
The third thing that I want to emphasize is to make it fun to use your product, or 
at least to make it pain free. There are so many products in the world with a very poor 
user experience, spanning from TV remote controls to software packages to web 
pages. Create products that are fun to use. Success lies down that path.

About the Author 
Christian Kraft was born in Denmark in 1967. 
After graduating his Masters of Electronic En-
gineering in 1991 at the University of Aalborg, 
he joined the mobile phone industry when 
some of the first digital handheld mobile 
phones were being developed. Christian has 
today worked in the Mobile Device industry for 
more than 18 years, 14 years for Nokia, and 4 
years for Sony and Hagenuk. Most of the years 
have been spent with strong focus on user in-
teraction design, user experience design, and 
innovation.   
Christian is sole- or co-inventor of some of the most used User Interfaces in 
the world from Nokia, as well as a number of big- and small-user experience 
innovations which have been and still are used by millions of mobile device users. 
With more than 100 patents filed under his name including a number of highly 
successful innovations for Nokia, Christian has proven his ability to create 
successful user experience innovation; he may well be one of the top three 
inventors in the Mobile Device industry.

What Other  
People Say 
Harri Kiljander, PhD, Director User Experience 
Design, F-Secure Corporation: 
“If you are working in a fast-paced new product development project or have just 
been given the task of figuring out why an earlier product or software release is 
not a raving success among its targeted user base, this book is for you. Written by a 
creative and productive user experience designer with a long and successful track 
record in user experience innovation, this is a practical cookbook for product de-
velopers, marketeers, strategists, and user experience practitioners alike.  
I learned to know Christian in the late 1990s when we were exploring future 
mobile phone user interaction opportunities in the corporate research unit of 
Nokia. That concept design work later found its way to about 1.5 billion Nokia 
mobile phones running the S40 software platform and user interface. Later on, we 
collaborated around topics like text input research and the seminal Navi-key user 
interface design.  
During his career, Christian has produced and contributed to numerous 
innovations and patents in the field of human-computer interaction, and in this 
book he unfolds his experiences and insights of the user experience what and how, 
describing recipes to be followed and warning about dead ends to be avoided. 
Equipped with the user experience toolbox introduced in this book, you will get a 
head start in creating the next product your users and customers will fall in love 
with.” 
Michael McKay, Sr Director, Design Language 
and Mobile Experiences, Yahoo!Design: 
"Creating breakthrough innovations is something most companies dream of and 
pursue. Few have succeeded and many talks and books have been made about the 
subject. Christian Kraft is one of those authentic innovators who actually has been 
there and created winning concepts. He is behind 100's of patentable concepts that 
millions of people have used.  I had the pleasure of working with Christian while at 
Nokia, where we joined his unique ideation techniques with User Driven Innova-
tion into a cross organizational ideation hub. 
In this book, Christian invites us into his special universe of User Experience 
Innovation. Christian shares stories from the birth of the telecom era with us. We

are presented with the background of the first game launched in a mobile phone 
device and several other now iconic features. He shows how the universal values 
of curiosity, creativity and persistence can drive innovation into the future."  
Panu Korhonen, Managing Director, Nordkapp: 
“Christian is the most productive inventor that I've ever seen. If you need to get 
convinced, just check out how many times his name can be found in the patent  
databases. 
Innovation requires creativity, persistence, attention to detail, and a very 
pragmatic mindset. Christian has all of this. I'm happy that he is sharing his secrets 
behind his innovation power in this practical and helpful book. It's a must read if 
you want to be a better innovator." 
Erik Anderson, Vice President, Strategy, Business 
Development, and Portfolio Management, Nokia: 
“I have worked with Christian over many years at Nokia. Christian is a classic 
“ideas man,” one of the most creative at Nokia, with many innovations and pat-
ents to his name.” 
Peter Dam Nielsen, Customer Experience Leader, 
Schneider Electric: 
“I have had the pleasure to work closely with Christian Kraft during almost a dec-
ade in Nokia Mobile Phones. During this time, Christian Kraft has been a constant 
source of inspiration to me and enriched my professional innovation abilities to a 
degree that made me a key inventor in Nokia and made me dedicate my profes-
sional life to constantly seek better and newer ways of meeting and exceeding the 
customer’s expectations.  
With this book, Christian Kraft has deservedly established himself as one of the 
pioneers within User Experience Innovation and I am convinced that with this 
book, not only larger corporations who seek methods to increase creativity and put 
more focus on innovation, but also individuals who want to make innovation more 
tangible and concretize their ideas into intellectual property rights, will have an 
extremely valuable tool”.

Acknowledgements 
I would like to thank my numerous colleagues, especially at Nokia: those who gave 
me freedom to pursue my ideas, those who appreciated my ideas, those who initi-
ated or inspired great ideas, those who helped or showed me new ways of innovat-
ing and those who have supported my ideas.  
Special thanks go to Peter Dam Nielsen, who has been my sparring partner in 
User Experience Innovation for more than ten years and with whom I have co-
created a large number of successful user experience innovations as well as 
methods for creating successful innovations. I guess that around half of my patents 
are due to my long sparring with him. 
I also want to give a big thank to my girlfriend for being very patient while 
writing this book. 
Finally, thanks to Søren Engelbrecht, imagepro.dk for the photo of me.
