Foreword
S
ince 1993, when I rode and for 12 days in my first attempt at
the Tour de France, the annual July event has become my
sporting life. Until 1996, I had finished the three-week race to Paris
only once, and when I was diagnosed with cancer, the Tour de
France became a memory. A much harder battle — that for life
itself — began. Life since that black period has taken on a new
meaning to me, and the Tour de France has been my target every
year since. I returned to racing in 1998, and by 1999, as a fitter and
mentally different rider, I returned to the Tour, racing for almost a
month in any kind of weather, over any type of terrain. I had
around me the best team of riders any Tour leader could wish for
(you’ll understand what I mean by that as you read this book). 
I am often asked why, as the overall winner, I do not win the last
stage into Paris. But as you find out in Tour de France For Dummies,
it doesn’t always work that way. Instead, those who feel they can
win the Tour go in search of gaining time on the specialist stages,
like the time trials or the grueling legs through the mountains.
These are the stages where the race is won and lost. Winning the
final stage would just be the icing on the cake.
When you look at your television screen and see these stages,
where a pack of riders all appear to be pedaling along together, you
may wonder where the excitement is. But the truth is, the Tour de
France is a happening bigger than any other annual sporting event.
Millions of roadside spectators derive pleasure from watching us
sweat it out in the heat of a French summer. In fact, for more than
100 years, the race has stopped France in its tracks each July.
Elections have even been moved to another date, because the
public has wanted to hear only about the race’s progress. During
the Tour, France is inundated by a media army numbering more
than a 1,000 and an entourage of more than 5,000, all of whom
follow the daily events as we journey around France and its neigh-
boring countries. Meanwhile, the 198 starters in the race are gradu-
ally reduced to perhaps 100 by the finish in Paris.

In this book, you come to understand an event that appears com-
plex, but is, in the end, pretty simple: The rider who gets back to
Paris in the fastest overall time is the winner. British cycling expert
Phil Liggett and Americans James Raia and Sammarye Lewis have
covered 44 Tours as writers, and Phil has not missed a wheel turn-
ing since 1973. Together, they take you through every detail of this
great event; after you read it, your next step is to turn up in France
and catch that most infectious enthusiasm known as Tour Fever.

Introduction
M
aybe Lance Armstrong’s recovery from cancer and his sub-
sequent Tour de France titles piqued your curiosity. Perhaps
a television video clip of a massive group of cyclists sprinting furi-
ously on the cobblestone streets of Paris caught your attention.
That’s the way the Tour de France works. A fleeting glimpse of the
race triggers an interest. All of a sudden, you want to know more.
You’re a fan. Then you’re hooked on everything about the race.
You can’t get enough and want to find out all you can. Tour de
France For Dummies can help. It provides race strategies, details
riders’ skills, examines rules and regulations, and explains nuances
of the three-week race and its more than 100-year history.
About This Book
Many available Tour de France books highlight its history and
champions. From early years, when the race almost ended two
years into its tenure, to the legacies of great riders, volumes detail
the Tour’s more than 100 years. This book covers that same infor-
mation, but it’s not only about specific race information. In this
book, you also find out about the people and places around the
event. Here, you find all the information you need to watch the
race in person, view it on television, or surf the Internet for results
and rider profiles.
In this book, we also examine the intricacies of bikes and how race
equipment has evolved through the years. There’s a century of
personalities, technology, history, and legend sprinkled throughout
this book — the Tour’s famous icons, infamous characters, and
fleeting moments that stand as epic testaments to the great race.
Conventions Used in This Book
The Tour de France resonates with the lexicon of France. As such,
French words and phrases used throughout this book are printed
in italics. We also help you pronounce them, in case you want to
sound like a cycling guru to your friends.

The most critical term to know is peloton (pell-oh-tawn), a French
term that means the main pack of riders. This term appears many
times throughout this book.
In gray boxes throughout the book, you also find sidebars — short
clips of information about interesting cyclists or other Tour infor-
mation. Skip these if you’re short on time, or head right for them if
you want a colorful lowdown on the Tour.
As a global sport, the Tour is followed by millions of fans via the
Internet. So, all Web sites listed in Tour de France For Dummies are
printed in a special font, like this. In some instances, Internet
addresses listed may have needed to break across two lines of text.
If that happened, rest assured we haven’t put in any extra charac-
ters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of
these Web addresses, just type it exactly the way you see it in this
book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Technically speaking, the Tour de France is not easy to follow. So,
throughout this book, text preceded by a Technical Stuff icon des-
ignates specific areas of technical overload. You don’t have to
examine technical sections to understand the subject it represents,
so feel free to skip these, if you want.
Foolish Assumptions
We make only one assumption about you, dear reader: You have an
interest in one of the world’s most enduring and popular sporting
events: the Tour de France. You may have watched the race on the
Outdoor Life Network or on one of the Tour’s many international
television network outlets. Or, you may have seen riders swiftly
cruise past an avenue of a French city you were visiting. However
you caught the Tour de France bug, this book explains event basics
to you (if you’re a newcomer) and also provides additional details
about the people, places, and equipment associated with this race
(if you already have some familiarity with the event).
How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies books, information in Tour de France For
Dummies is divided into five parts. Each part of the book contains
several chapters, as follows.
Tour de France For Dummies 
2

Part I: A Bicycle Race 
Unlike Any Other
The Tour de France is the world’s most popular and prestigious
bicycle race. In this part, you find out the event’s history, tradi-
tions, and basic elements as a team sport.
In Chapter 1, we discuss how the Tour began and how the race is
conducted as a team event — that is, individual riders competing
within teams. All details necessary to follow the event, whether
you’re watching from the sidelines in France or sitting comfortably
on your living room couch, are also featured in Chapter 1. In
Chapter 2, specifics are highlighted: from how the race route is
chosen each year to the varied unique subcategories of competi-
tions within the overall race.
The Tour is replete with tradition, and in Chapter 3, you get the
scoop on race jerseys and find out why certain riders wear jerseys
like no one else in the race. You also discover the meaning and
nuances of the podium and its awards and honors. Finally, you get
a look at other race specialties, like the honor of being in last place
and how racers manage to please their sponsors.
Part II: How the Race Is Run
and Won
It’s not always apparent on a day-to-day basis, but the Tour is
won by an individual who’s part of a team. In this part, all individ-
ual riders’ responsibilities are detailed, as are the race’s varied
rules and protocol. You’re also introduced to teams’ non-riding
personnel — from managers to massage therapists. They orches-
trate teams’ daily operations.
Interpersonal relationships are integral to a team’s success in the
Tour. In Chapter 4, riders’ individual roles are described as well as
the characteristics that make cyclists successful as climbers,
sprinters, and team riders. How the race progresses each day —
its rules, time limits, drug tests, and race fines — are explained in
Chapter 5.
Astute racing strategy helps teams get their star riders to the
podium. How it all works is explained in Chapter 6.
Introduction

Part III: Loving the Ride: 
A Man and His Bike
It has changed throughout the years, but now nearly 200 riders
begin each Tour on the first weekend in July. This part introduces
riders and tells you how they do what they do. You find out how
the sport’s best athletes prepare and maintain their bodies. You
find out how riders train for months — even years — and then per-
severe while pedaling for more than 2,000 miles around France and
other nearby countries.
Chapter 7 explains how riders take care of their bodies before,
during, and after every Tour stage. From proper hydration to with-
standing sickness and mechanical failures, it’s all part of a Tour
rider’s typical day. So, a special chapter (Chapter 8) takes you
through a day in the life of a Tour cyclist, including eating teams
meals, finding a little relaxation time, getting daily massages, and
dealing with fans.
Technology is critical to success at the Tour, so Chapter 9 provides
all sorts of information about cyclists’ different bikes and the
mechanics who make sure the riders pedal their machines in top
mechanical condition. What the riders wear in all kinds of weather
conditions is also detailed in Chapter 9.
Part IV: Watching the Race
When you’re a Tour fan, more is better. The race is followed pas-
sionately around the globe, and millions of fans attend the race
each year and follow it in newspapers, on television, on the radio
and TV, and on the Internet.
Whether you’re watching race action from a French roadside or a
reclining chair in the family room, Chapter 10 gives you a multitude
of information resources. You find out where to watch Tour action at
home and where to cybersurf to get instant race updates. If you’re
planning to watch the Tour in person, Chapter 11 gives options and
suggestions for planning a perfect Tour de France experience.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book concludes with signature lists of ten
items called The Part of Tens. In this book, the Part of Tens
includes honorees as best riders in Tour history, ten important 
editions of the Tour de France, unique Tour statistics, dramatic

tour moments, famous race climbs, and a list of other cycling races
around the world.
Icons Used in This Book
Small pictures placed in the margins of this book are used to alert
you to specific kinds of information. Icons point to cycling termi-
nology, racing nuances, information suited for memorizing, and
complicated regulations. Here’s what they mean.
This icon gives you snippets of information, various tricks, and
special shortcuts. It also designates cycling jargon. The sport has
a vast selection of terms used by those involved with the sport.
Use these terms, and your “guru status” appreciably improves.

hibited over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the Tour is
replete with technical details. The icon designates percentages,
various mileage totals, and other Tour statistics and highlights.
Where to Go from Here
If you want to know how and why cities host Tour de France
stages, turn to Chapter 2. Ever wonder how much money Tour
cyclists win for claiming a stage or winning a jersey competition?
Check out Chapter 4. And if you’re thinking about attending the
Tour or want to watch it on television, details to both possibilities
are in Chapter 10.
You can turn to any chapter in Tour de France For Dummies and get
specific Tour information. If you’re watching a stage and there’s a
quick, significant development, look for the topic in the Table of
Contents or index, find your subject and flip to the appropriate
chapter. That’s the format trademark of For Dummies books. You
can read chapters as self-contained minibooks. Of course, you can
also start with Chapter 1, if you wish, and read straight through to
the end.

n this part, you discover Tour de France basics — its
history, race rules, strategy, and how the three-week
event operates. From watching the race at home to travel-
ing to witness it in person, this part provides speciﬁcs on
how to spectate and understand the different kinds of
cycling that make up the Tour.
This part also details cyclists’ different jerseys and why
some cyclists wear identical outﬁts, while a handful of
other riders wear vastly different jerseys. You’re also
introduced to ﬁnish-line customs and to various nuances
and race traditions.

E
very July, daily life changes in France, and has for the past 100
years or so. That’s when the Tour de France — a fast-moving
circus of cyclists — makes its way around the country. The Tour
consists of nearly 200 riders from a couple dozen countries pedal-
ing through fields of sunflowers and vineyards and climbing into
thin mountain air.
Why do cyclists want to do this? This chapter tells you why. You
discover how and why the Tour began and how to understand race
operations and strategies. You get all Tour basics: what equipment
riders are using, what apparel they’re wearing, and what they’re
eating and drinking. You also find out how they do what they do,
every day, for three weeks. You find out how, as a Tour de France
fan, you can follow the Tour in person, watch it on television, or
follow every kilometer of the race on your laptop computer.
Understanding the Race 
and the Strategies
Condensed to its basic premise, the Tour de France is a simple ath-
letic contest: The cyclist who completes a strenuous and often per-
ilous course of more than 2,000 miles in the lowest total time wins.

Yet, the event is so much more. Steeped in history, tradition, and
racing lore, the Tour defines endurance and global sportsmanship.
Unlike professional sports played in stadiums and arenas filled
with fans who’ve paid for tickets, the Tour stands alone in the
sports world. Its arena extends past countries’ borders, and for
fans, it’s the best bargain in sports, because it’s free.
For riders, it’s a job with an equally simple equation. While pro-
gressing along the course like chess pieces on wheels, riders
face the limits of endurance. They battle inclement weather and
attempt to outwit and outrace each other while using the same
strategy — conserve energy as much as possible for the times
when it’s needed most.
Working together
Riders participating in the Tour compete at the top of the sport. The
Tour is the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup, World Series, Winston Cup, and
NBA Championship of bicycle racing. Functioning as a team sport
(see Chapters 4 and 6 for details), the race features teams of nine
cyclists selected from a larger group of teammates. Reaping the ben-
efits of synergy, teams work as units, and each rider has varying
responsibilities. As riders make their way around France and into
neighboring countries, teams that use sound racing strategies tend
to have the most success — for the group and for the team captain.
Winning individually
Individuals win stages and one rider claims the overall title.
Winning a Tour de France stage is the career highlight for many
cyclists. Every day, one rider is victorious, and he climbs onto the
finish podium after a stage win and hears fans’ cheers and receives
various accolades. But a rider’s individual triumph, at least to
some degree, is the result of selfless teammates. It’s rare for a
cyclist to win a stage without acknowledging teammates who’ve
put him in a position to ride to a triumph.
Understanding Those
Colored Jerseys
Riders on each team are required to wear the same color jersey (as
discussed Chapter 3). Each team’s jersey features logos of spon-
sors who pay the riders’ salaries. The result is a kaleidoscope of
moving billboards on wheels. Some teams’ uniforms feature subtle
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
10

colors; other teams opt for brighter colors. Some teams’ uniforms
look surprisingly similar, further adding to the blur of the often
fast-moving peloton (the main pack of riders).
A few riders wear special jerseys. Throughout the race, the reign-
ing World Champion wears his team colors, but on a special jersey
with horizontal stripes. National current road champions wear
team jerseys featuring their country’s colors.
Four other cyclists also wear different colored jerseys each day
(see Figure 1-1).
 The yellow jersey represents the race leader.
 The green jersey represents the race’s best sprinter.
 The polka dot jersey designates the race’s finest climber.
 The white jersey designates the highest-ranked rider in the
overall competition age 25 or younger.
Figure 1-1: Winners wearing their jerseys on the podium at the 2004 Tour de
France. From left, Robbie McEwen, Lance Armstrong, Richard Virenque, and
Vladimir Karpets.
In most instances, cyclists wearing specialty jerseys like to wear
them as long as they can during the race. But the colored jerseys
of the Tour change often, and the anticipation of those costume
changes each day helps make the Tour a race of many races. See
Chapter 3 for additional details on special jerseys.
Chapter 1: Answering All Your Tour Questions 11

Choosing the Right Stuff:
From Bikes to Snacks
Since the Tour began, the equipment that riders use and the meth-
ods they employ for keeping themselves nutritionally prepared to
ride have changed a lot and not very much at the same time. Bikes
still have two wheels, two brakes, two pedals, a frame, handlebar,
gears, and a saddle. Riders still wear cycling shoes. But technology
(see more in Chapter 9) has catapulted current Tour bikes into the
forefront of aerodynamic efficiency. Tour cyclists’ machines were
once steel. Aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber materials are now
in the mix. Gearing options have also dramatically improved since
front and rear derailleurs became common in the 1950s.
Cyclists ate bread and pasta in the Tour’s early days, just as they
do today. But riders’ nutrition (discussed in Chapters 7 and 8) is
now a science. Tour cyclists drank alcohol like water during the
race’s infancy, and it was many a rider’s delight to smoke ciga-
rettes. And while a celebratory sip or two of champagne is still 
traditional during the Tour’s final stage, there’s no smoking. The
infamous tales of riders lighting each other’s cigarettes are now
only billows of smoke in Tour lore.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
12
Pedaling through decades of technology
Imagine Tour riders in 1903 riding a saddle that included synthetic gels for comfort.
What would those pioneering Tour riders think of today’s clipless pedals and aero-
dynamic handlebars that allow cyclists to ride in tucked positions like downhill
racers?
Tour riders now use equipment built by computer-generated formulas. It’s tested in
wind tunnels and perfected by a battery of engineers and mechanics. Just like the
riders of yesteryear, competing in the Tour today includes a man-versus-machine
dynamic. Riders are hard on their bikes; bikes are hard on riders. Throughout the
Tour’s history — from ancient bikes to state-of-the art machines — one constant
has remained: Something will go wrong with riders’ bikes during the race. Whether
riders use steel or titanium frames, mechanical problems occur every day at the
Tour de France, and always when riders least expect them.

Tour de France teams employ riders, managers, physicians,
masseurs, trainers — and cooks. While riding an average of more
than 100 miles per day, Tour cyclists eat nearly constantly. It’s rare
when they can adequately keep up with their bodies’ nutritional
requirements. Team cooks do their best to keep riders properly
nourished. Cooks prepare riders’ meals for breakfast, dinner, and
a prerace meal, when the Tour’s starting time allows. But it’s not
just quantity that counts, rather the quality of the quantity. As
endurance athletes, riders need specific amounts of carbohy-
drates, protein, and fat. If the equation isn’t right, it can mean the
difference between riders’ successes and failures.
Spectating During the Tour
Unlike stadium and arena sporting events, there are no official atten-
dance figures for the Tour de France. Many kilometers of the course
are nearly spectator free. But at each stage’s starting and finishing
lines, on mountain climbs, and along the final-day cobblestones of
Paris, watching the Tour (see more on this in Chapter 10) is a way
of life. Millions of spectators attend the race every year (see Figure
1-2), some of whom camp for days to reserve key viewing perches.
Millions more enthusiasts around the world watch the event live and
on a tape-delayed basis. Radio listenership is global and massive.
Cycling-specific Web site traffic grows exponentially during the Tour.

Chapter 1: Answering All Your Tour Questions 13

Watching the Tour from home
Tour fans in France who don’t attend the race in person are still
fortunate. The event is broadcast live on the French national net-
work every day (see Chapter 10). Most stages are organized to
finish around 5 p.m. in France, the prime viewing hour.
Dozens of countries have similar broadcasts, including, since 2001,
daily live coverage on the Outdoor Life Network (OLN), the first
North American network to offer live daily coverage.
Searching for Tour information
Daily European newspapers provide vast Tour information. It’s
front-page news and often dominates sports section coverage.
L’Equipe, the French daily sports newspaper, is a Tour sponsor,
so it publishes specialty magazines on the Tour and provides the
public with an overwhelming amount or race information — from
race reports to rider profiles, from road closures to columnists’
strong opinions. The International Herald Tribune and USA Today’s
international edition provide major English newspaper coverage.
The Tour’s online presence (see Chapter 10) has reached its satu-
ration point. The official Tour Web site, www.LeTour.fr features
near-immediate details of every stage. Commercial sites — from
newspapers’ online editions to specialty magazines’ sites — battle
for fast and more comprehensive Tour news coverage. Many sites
feature riders’ daily diaries from inside the peloton, while blogs,
cycling forums, and chat rooms burst with activity.
Making the trip to the Tour
By plane, train, automobile, or bicycle, attending the Tour has
become an increasingly popular way for cycling fans seeking a vaca-
tion to get their fill. Most major international airlines fly into Orly
International Airport and Charles de Gaulle International Airport, the
two major Paris airports. With rare exception, the start of the Tour is
within a few hours’ drive or train ride from either of these airports.
July is the busiest time of year for travel to France, so make airline,
hotel, and car rental reservations by early spring — at the latest.
Traveling with a tour group is another increasingly popular option.
Numerous retired Tour riders have lent their names to tour outfits
that provide on-course training rides, varying accommodation
options, and catered meals. Regardless of the travel method, Tour
visitors should firmly adhere to one well-known Tour spectators’
creed: Get there early and prepare to stay late.

Chapter 2
Understanding the Tour de
France Race Routes
In This Chapter
 Staging the race, day to day
 Riding in peaks and valleys
 Pedaling fast, faster, and fastest
 Hosting the race and entering a bidding war
C
oordinating the Tour de France each year takes years of plan-
ning. Law enforcement agencies, government officials, tourism
departments, and many businesses all cooperate. And when it all
comes together, this huge traveling sporting event — and the carni-
val surrounding it — envelopes France for three weeks.
This chapter details how the Tour is methodically planned and
how the event advances on a day-to-day basis. Where does the
route go — and why? Why is the race divided into stages? How do
teams know about each day’s route?
What’s a Stage, How Many Are
There, and How Long Are They?
Although there’s no theatrical stage, each day’s race at the Tour
de France is called a stage, and each one offers plenty of theatrics.
Riders encounter and endure miles of country and mountain roads
throughout France and other countries, including Germany, Italy,
Belgium, and Luxembourg. The accumulation of its stages makes
the Tour de France what is called a stage race.
No set number of stages is required in the Tour each year. But in
recent years, at least 20 stages and a total of approximately 3,300
kilometers (2,047 miles) have comprised the race. The cyclist with
the lowest cumulative time after the 20 stages wins.

Individual stage mileage and total race mileage are secondary in
importance to the route cyclists take each day to get from start to
finish. For example, a shorter mountainous stage is generally more
difficult than a flat stage that’s twice the length. How race organiz-
ers choose to design each year’s race course keeps the more than
100-year-old race fresh and appealing to long-time fans and to
event newcomers.
Choosing the Route and
Stage Each Year
Teams, riders, and cycling fans eagerly await the announcement of
each year’s Tour route. Race dates, the cities in which stages start
and finish, the rest days, and details of every stage are announced
at a lavish Tour presentation luncheon in Paris in late October. Tour
organizers do their best to keep the majority of the route locations
undisclosed until the fall extravaganza. But media leaks occur every
year, and the race provides it owns teasers to the media. In fact, the
starting city, known as Le Grand Depart, and a few early race stages
are sometimes revealed more than a year in advance.
A huge media contingent, many past and present Tour stars, spon-
sors, and race management attend the Tour presentation, where
every detail of every day of the following summer’s race is
revealed. Attendees then debate for hours whether the new course
is more difficult or easier than the previous year’s journey.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
16
The Tour’s owner: Amaury
Sport Organization
How the race progresses each year is the responsibility of its owner, Amaury Sport
Organization (ASO), a French athletic sports promotion and marketing company. In
addition to the Tour de France, the Paris-based ASO oversees more than 100 days
of sports competition per year. The company has more than 200 employees and
manages events from golf tournaments to marathons, equestrian events to car
racing.
As part of the French press group Philippe Amaury Publications (E.P.A.), owner of
several publications, ASO has a close relationship and has worked for many years
with two prominent Tour newspapers, l’Euipe and Le Parisien, daily papers that
report extensively on the Tour de France.
Created in 1992, ASO has expanded its cycling responsibilities in recent years and
also overseas other races, including Paris-Nice, Tour of Qatar, and Tour du Faso.

One major consideration each year is whether the Tour follows a
clockwise or counterclockwise route. Here are some examples
from six Tours:
 2000: The 2000 route began in Futuroscope, France, advanced
north toward the west coast, and then circled back toward the
start on a north to south, counterclockwise route. The course
reached the southern tip of France after about a week. It then
progressed east and then north along the coast for more than
a week before abruptly heading northwest into the heartland
for two days toward the Paris conclusion.
 2001: Starting near the northern tip of France in Dunkirk, the
2001 Tour immediately moved into Belgium for three days
before returning to France. The route followed a north to
south, clockwise route along the country’s eastern border.
The course reached the southern tip of France at mid-race,
moved west along the coast for three days, and then moved
inland for the final week toward the Paris finish.
 2002: Beginning in Luxembourg, the 2002 Tour entered France
after three days and followed a nontraditional counterclock-
wise path east to west across northern France. The race pro-
gressed to the west coast, and then moved south and followed
the border before advancing into the mountains and into the
heart of France to the Paris conclusion.
 2003: The 2003 route began in St. Denis, France, and pro-
gressed on a traditional clockwise route north, and then
moved directly south toward Lyon and into the Alps. The
route then advanced to the southern border and followed a
coastal route north for more than a week before heading
inland for the Paris finale.
 2004: The 2004 route began in Liege, Belgium, and followed a
nontraditional, counterclockwise direction toward the north-
western coast of France, before heading inland, and then
south. The route meandered around the country’s southern
coastline before heading north into the Alps, and then headed
toward the center of France and onward to the traditional
conclusion in Paris.
 2005: The 2005 route advanced clockwise around France fol-
lowing an opening stage from Fromentine to the Noirmoutier-
en-lile off the coast of the Vendee region of western France.
The race concluded with a 160-kilometer (100-mile) stage from
Corbeil-Essones to Paris. When the Tour followed a counter-
clockwise route, it advanced first into the Pyrenees, the more
rolling of the two most famous French mountain ranges, and
then into the Alps. In a clockwise route, the more jagged-
peaked Alps were scheduled in the second week, followed by
the Pyrenees.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Tour de France Race Routes 17

Paris has been the host city of the final day of the Tour de France
every year since 1975. The wide cobblestone streets and renowned
architecture, history, and cultural icons make the capital of France
the ideal concluding city. Paris has hosted the beginning or ending
of a Tour de France stage 131 times, well more than any other
French city.
Figuring Out Where to Start
Each year’s starting city is the Tour’s primary concern. Cities place
bids years in advance, particularly if a city outside of France seeks
to host Le Grande Depart. Ample hotel accommodations, historic
significance to the race, and famous past Tour riders are all consid-
erations, as are available railway and airport routes.
Why would a city want to host a Tour de France stage? Just like the
World Series or Super Bowl, being part of the event adds promi-
nence to a city or a region. When a Tour stage begins or ends in a
city, it guarantees several situations — some good, some not so
good.
Economically, a departure or arrival hosting city will have its hotels,
motels, and bed and breakfasts packed for days. Restaurants and
pubs will likely have one of their best financial days of the year.
At the same time, each departure and arrival city, particularly
those in the mountains, can expect horrendous traffic jams prior to
and after stages are held. For many hosting cities, a visit from the
Tour alters much of the city’s normal way of life.
The process for choosing cities for the next Tour begins shortly
after the final day of the current year’s race. Tour organizers visit
interested areas, and interested cities’ representatives present pro-
posals to the Tour organizers.
Interested cities can choose to host a start, finish, or both. Some
cities have held only one departure or one finish, while others
have been involved regularly since the race began in 1903.
Here’s a list of cities with long tenures of hosting Tour stage starts
and finishes (see Figure 2-1 for a map of France to help you get
your bearings):

Chapter 2: Understanding the Tour de France Race Routes 19
A special stage for a special year
One year after the Tour’s hundred-year anniversary, Tour organizers needed to do
something powerful. The 2003 edition received even more vast global attention than
regular Tour years, and after that, potential interest could have waned, so what did
organizers do? They came up with perhaps the most unique and widely publicized
stage in race history.
Traditionally, the finishing climb to L’Alpe d’Huez, a mountain ski resort in south-
eastern France, is the most famous section of road in the race. The narrow route is
a 13.8-kilometer (91⁄2-mile) ascent that features 21 switchbacks (steep, zigzagging
roads) or what the French call bends. The average grade of the road is 7.9 percent,
with some sections increasing to 14 percent. The course ends at an elevation of
1,850 meters or 6,102 feet.
The climb to L’Alpe d’Huez has been included in the Tour 23 times dating to 1952.
Italy’s Fausto Coppi won the inaugural stage, en route to capturing the second of his
two overall race titles. In every race prior to 2004, however, the famous climb
occurred after cyclists had already pedaled for hours; they then had to finish the
day’s weary effort with the arduous climb to the ski resort.
The exception was 2004. Tour organizers decided to contest only the climb, as an
individual race called an individual time trial, as the 16th of the race’s 20 stages.
Riders competed in reverse order of their position in the overall standings. As every
cyclist rode alone up the mountain with only a team car and police motorcycle as
escorts, an estimated 750,000 spectators, camped on the mountain road, cheered
and jeered throughout day, and then celebrated late into the night.
Lance Armstrong won the stage in 39 minutes and 41 seconds, defeating Jan Ullrich
of Germany (Telekom) by 1 minute and 1 second. Armstrong rode at an average
speed of 141⁄2 mph (just over 23 kph), an extraordinarily fast pace considering the
severity of the terrain.

Despite its century steeped in tradition, one great appeal of the
Tour de France is its flexibility. Organizers arrange the course as
they choose, but always with a plan to include a balance of most of
the different types of races or all of them. And each year, organiz-
ers spice up the course with something new, like successive moun-
taintop finishes or unique starting cities, like the 1998 start in
Dublin, Ireland.

Tour organizers mix and match different types of races into
the Tour:
 A Prologue (time trial): In most recent years, the Tour has
started with a short individual race called a Prologue. Winners
of the brief event (it’s always shorter than eight kilometers)
claim race leadership for the first official opening stage the
following day.
 Flat and rolling stages: Flat and rolling stages across the
French countryside often comprise the first week.
 Mountain stages: Strenuous mountain stages high into the
sometimes snow-capped peaks of the Alps and Pyrenees are
held in the second week and into the third week.
 Individual time trials: Individual time trials, in which cyclists
pedal solo and are timed against the clock, are interspersed
strategically throughout the race.
 Team time trials: Team time trials — that is, each team riding
together individually against the clock — aren’t held every
year (see Figure 2-2, which shows the start of a time trial
course), but are added some years for variety.
Each is explained in more detail in the following sections.
Figure 2-2: The host town of Cambria gives a giant welcome to Stage 4 of the
2004 Tour de France.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Tour de France Race Routes 21

Prologues and high speeds
As a ceremonial prerace, Prologues provide a quick, exciting Tour
start. Individual time trials less than 8 kilometers (5 miles) in length,
Prologues comprise a few minutes of individual, high-speed pedaling
for every cyclist in the field. The race’s winner wears the leader’s
yellow jersey for the first official stage held the following day.
Prologues aren’t held every year, but when contested, the short
distance gives fans immediate knowledge of just how fast cyclists
can pedal. Prologues also provide the first look at the condition or
lack of condition of overall title favorites, and showcase the most
technological advances in bikes, wheels, helmets, clothing, and
so on.
In the 2004 Tour, young Swiss rider Fabian Cancellara surprised the
favorites, including Lance Armstrong. Riding for the Italian team
Fassa Bortolo, Cancellara claimed the Prologue in 6 minutes and 51
seconds — an average speed of 53.560 kilometers per hour (33.22
mph). As an omen for what was pending in the rest of the race,
Cancellara’s effort was the third-fastest Prologue in race history
and 2 seconds faster than the effort of runner-up Armstrong.
Flat and rolling stages
For the first week of the race, the course usually offers long, flat
stretched that are gobbled up by the peloton. Stages may include
some brief, low-graded climbs, but in general, teams try to get
their sprinters in position for furiously quick dashes to finish lines.
Despite the less technical nature of the Tour’s early stages, the
week can be dangerous. Riders are nervous when the Tour begins,
and it’s not uncommon for the entire peloton (pack of riders) to
ride en masse into finishing towns. Race organizers utilize as much
of the finishing cities’ geography as possible to appeal to crowds
and to capitalize on sponsorship opportunities. As such, narrow,
tight turns are common in the waning miles of flat stages, and one
false move in the group when it’s moving at high speed can result
in disastrous crashes.
The first week of racing in the Tour can also provide some of the
most scenic and panoramic views of the race. Because early stages
encompass long stretches of flat terrain, France’s vast vineyards and
miles of sunflowers are often omnipresent. It’s these scenarios —
large groups of cyclists moving across the country together with
postcard perfect backdrops — that provide travel brochure images
for Tour organizers.

Making the grade: Mountain stages
Mountains, with their snow-capped peaks, thin air, winding and
steep climbs, and harrowing and narrow descents, define the Tour
de France. Some Tour routes in mountains are as famous as the
race itself. And it’s the strength and talent of some cyclists to get
to the top of mountains swiftly that separates them from the rest
of the field.
Like all the stages, mountain stages included in the Tour change
each year, depending upon how race organizers coordinate the
route. The course logically encompasses departure and arrival
cities and at least a few of the numerous famous peaks of the
French Alps and Pyrenees.
Mountain stages include climbs categorized by number, ranging
from 4 (easiest) to 1 (hardest). The most difficult climbs are so
steep, they’re beyond categorizing, or hors categorie.
Categorizing climbs is objective and subjective. The length of the
climb, the difference in altitude from the bottom to the top, its
average grade and steepest grade, and where the climb is posi-
tioned in the stage are all important factors. The elevation of the
climb’s summit and the width and condition of the road are also
contributing factors. Figure 2-3 shows a mountainous stage.
Certain general guidelines dictate how climbs are categorized, but
race directors in different races rate climbs differently. Even year
to year in the Tour de France, discrepancies occur.
In general terms, Category 4 climbs are short and easy. Category 3
climbs last approximately 5 kilometers (3.1 miles), have an average
grade of 5 percent, and ascend 150 meters (500 feet). Category 2
climbs are the same length or longer at an 8 percent grade and
ascend 500 meters (1,600 feet). Category 1 climbs last 20 kilome-
ters (12.4 miles) with an average 6 percent grade and ascend 1,500
meters. Beyond category climbs include an altitude difference of at
least 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) from start to finish and have an aver-
age grade of at least 7 percent.
A 1 percent grade means a road ascends 1 meter (3.28 feet) for
every 100 meters (328 feet) it advances.

Individual time trials
More than any other Tour de France race, time trials allow the
most riders to showcase their strengths. Cyclists compete individ-
ually and against only one competitor — the timing clock. Unlike
road racing’s team strategy, drafting (riding close behind another
rider so as to cut down on the effects of wind) and the flow of the
peloton, success in an individual time trial is entirely a solo accom-
plishment. Every split seconds counts. Riders’ aerodynamics
matched with their physical skills add up to a simple equation.
The fastest man on a bike on any given day wins.
Course distances and routes vary greatly, but time trial routes are
generally around 50 kilometers (31.2 miles) and encompass hilly,
flat, undulating, and curved road sections. Riders negotiate the
course as fast as possible while keeping an appropriate pace and
utilizing superior bike-handling skills.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Tour de France Race Routes 25
Mountain men on wheels
Two types of cyclists excel in mountain stages — riders in contention for the over-
all title and mountain climbing specialists who seek single stage wins, which are
prestigious in their own right. A rider who doesn’t climb well can’t win the Tour, but
some cyclists who climb well are not in contention for the overall title. They don’t
have strong time trial skills or aren’t part of strong teams. Instead, mountain spe-
cialists pick specific stages and attempt to grab the glory — just for the day or for
a few stages scattered throughout the race.
Every year at the race announcement there’s plenty of discussion of whether race
organizers have devised a course with hopes to dethrone the defending champion.
Race tradition dictates that organizers plan a course that doesn’t favor the reigning
champion’s strengths, but they never admit such practices.
As Lance Armstrong added to his six (as of this writing) consecutive race victories,
Tour race director Jean-Marie Leblanc has dramatically altered the route. Some
years during Armstrong’s reign, new routes have featured fewer strenuous climbs
and less taxing individual time trials. Armstrong’s career success has been built
with a simple formula: The harder a race, the better.
Leblanc’s course alterations have made little difference. Like other champions,
Armstrong doesn’t react strongly to varying course routes. Leblanc doesn’t react
strongly, either. With a staff of colleagues and other experts’ opinions, each year’s
course is chosen via logistical and financial considerations — and with the defend-
ing champion’s mastery in mind. The route is also selected with an additional sub-
jective consideration — just how severely the race director wishes to torture or not
torture cyclists in any given year.

A successful time trialist is not unlike an endurance runner or
an ultradistance swimmer. In some ways, time trials are cyclists’
marathons. Start a time trial too fast and there’s little hope for
maintaining a proper steady pace for the duration of the stage.
Start too slow in a time trial and a rider may never find the proper
rhythm. Unlike endurance sports where certain athletes’ body
types are conducive to success, great individual time trial riders
come in all shapes and sizes.
Race organizers can adjust starting time gaps between riders, but
most time trials begin with riders leaving a starting ramp 2 minutes
apart. Cyclists compete in the reverse order of their position in the
General Classification (the current standings). If a faster rider is
about to overtake a slower rider, he must pass while leaving at
least a 2-meter distance to prevent drafting, which is illegal only at
this point in the race. A passed slower rider then must ride at least
25 meters behind to prevent him from getting the drafting benefits
of a slipstream from the leading rider.
A team vehicle carrying spare bikes and wheels must follow every
rider in an individual time trial. The vehicle must remain about 10
meters behind the rider, and it can’t pull even with its riders at
anytime during the stage. Any information exchange between a
cyclist and his team vehicle must occur from behind and at least
from a 10-meter distance. A vehicle can be positioned between two
riders if there’s at least 50 meters between riders.
Team time trials
Team time trials seem like oxymorons. Individual time trials test
riders’ solo strengths; Team time trials bring team strategy back into
the race equation. Often cited as the most photogenic cycling disci-
pline, each team’s riders ride together, beginning 5 minutes apart.
They pedal in a tightly packed, single- or double-file procession.
Cyclists rotate in and out of the front of the group to take advan-
tage of opportunities to draft. Each rider alternately blocks the
wind for teammates and then returns into the team formation to
conserve energy. A rider may take a turn at the front of his group
for 20 seconds and then fall back into the mix of his teammates.
Like fast-moving, human-powered, aerodynamic trains, teams
advance around corners, over railroad tracks and undulations,
and through roadside villages. Visually, the swift packs moving in
unison provide excitement for spectators and delightful opportuni-
ties for race photographers’ keen eyes.
Despite their intriguing nature, team time trials present unique dif-
ficulties. If a rider just slightly falls out of rotation, he can initiate a
sudden and disastrous crash involving his entire team. If a rider
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
26

can’t keep the same pace as his teammates, he quickly falls off the
back of the team and diminishes his team’s collective strength.
While important, team time trials are not often held during the long
racing season. Teams rarely have opportunities to practice, but
done properly, a team time trial takes precise cooperation and
coordination among team members. Teams must find an ideal pace
despite riders’ varying skills. When a team in a team time trial
accomplishes its goal, synergy is defined.
Teams must start a team time trial with all their riders. Teams use
different strategies. Some squads hope to finish with all riders
together and rotate positions until every rider is close to the finish.
Other teams have designated strong riders stay at the front for
longer durations, only to purposely fall off pace near the conclu-
sion. All teams must finish with at least five riders to get an official
time. The time of the fifth rider crossing the line determines the
team’s finishing time.
Scouting the New Route:
Practice Makes Perfect
Marathon runners sometimes opt for training runs on their home-
town marathon course weeks and even months before marathon
day. The same isn’t often possible for Tour de France cyclists. Many
French riders live in France, and their extended backyards comprise
at least part of the Tour de France course.
But what do other Tour de France cyclists do to familiarize them-
selves with the race and its varied stages? With a global race
schedule that includes more than 100 races from January through
October, teams have difficulty during the season viewing
announced Tour venues or potential race routes.
With increasing regularity in recent years, many teams have discov-
ered a new way to test mountain stages or specific road routes. In
preseason training camps or when there’s a break between racing
schedules, teams find accommodations in the Alps, Pyrenees, or
other centralized locations and set up temporary training bases.
Most top international pro teams have rosters with more than two-
dozen riders, so at any given time of the year, part of a team may
be competing in one race while another part of the team competes
in another race. The same scenario occurs in some training camps.
A core group of a team attends the camp, while other teammates
are competing elsewhere.
Chapter 2: Understanding the Tour de France Race Routes 27

Riders aren’t necessarily familiar with the route of every stage of
the Tour before race day. After the overall route is announced,
teams analyze the course and decide what stages are likely key
days. During minicamps, cyclists may ride a designated Tour stage
route repeatedly, noting the ascents, descents, bends, and poten-
tial hazards.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
28
Climbing L’Alpe d’Huez
Climbing L’Alpe d’Huez is a coveted experience for Tour de France cyclists and ama-
teur riders seeking a riding memory of the event to relate to friends. The ascent to
the ski resort has been done hundreds of times during the Tour, but never just as a
time trial.
As such, by the time the new stage was held during the 2004 Tour, rumors of riders
pedaling up the hill repeatedly in training sessions began to circulate. And when
Lance Armstrong pedaled to his dominating win over Jan Ullrich, one sure reason
was that practice makes perfect. Armstrong reportedly rode the course more than
a half-dozen times in practice.
During the Tour, riders preview courses, particularly time trial routes. If riders’ start-
ing times are later in the day, they may ride the course early on the morning of the
race and then watch a teammate ride the course while in the comfort of a team
vehicle. Riders who contest a time trial course early in a stage can help their team-
mates riding later in day. After completing the course, an early day rider relates any
problem areas on the route to his teammates and team director. And all riders
receive a daily map that fits into their jerseys’ pockets.

O
nly a few riders compete for overall victory each year at the
Tour de France. But every day, there’s plenty else going on in
the peloton (the main group of riders). Beyond racing for overall
victory, the best sprinter, best climber, and best young rider com-
petitions progress daily, sometimes with battles more intense than
the quest for the overall title.
Stage winners are honored each day on the finishing podium, as are
leaders of other competitions. Every rider in the field has a good
opportunity to claim something — a stage win, a midrace sprint, a
kiss from a pretty girl at the postrace awards ceremony, a bouquet
of flowers, a stuffed lion, or even the unofficial but respected honor
of finishing last. The overall race leader is, of course, also acknowl-
edged, and he gets his share of awards and recognition.
The Tour de France also has a team competition and daily and over-
all rewards for the most competitive riders. These competitions
aren’t represented by jerseys, but are important parts of the race.
This chapter describes races within the race that add excitement
and keep each day’s racing animated. Why do some riders wear dif-
ferent colored jerseys? What is the podium and what happens there?
What’s the red lantern or lanterne rouge? What do the awards mean,
and who are those pretty girls on the podium, anyway?

Timing: Every Second Counts
Every Tour de France stage is timed, and there are no timeouts for
trains, planes, or automobiles. There’s no stopping the clock for
railroad crossings, for animals in the road, or for slow-moving farm
equipment. And there are no television timeouts.
Every rider is given a time as he crosses the finish line, and all
riders’ finishing times are visible on a large digital clock positioned
above the finish line. The race’s overall time is the accumulated
time of all stages, but there are exceptions. In designated places
during stages and for top placings at the finish, riders get bonus
seconds subtracted from their overall times. Riders are also given
points in predetermined sprints during and at the end of stages.
Riders can also be penalized for various rule infractions, from hold-
ing onto team cars to public urination.
Getting sprints, points, 
and bonus seconds
Depending on the type of road stage — flat, medium mountain, and
high mountain — the top-25 finishers in each stage are awarded
points.
 Stage winners in flat stages receive 35 points, and the total
decreases to 1 point for the 25th-place finisher.
 In medium mountain stages, winners receive 25 points, and
the 20th-place rider receives 1 point.
 In high mountain stages, winners receive 20 points, and the
15th-place finisher receives 1 point.
In the Prologue and in individual time trials, winners receive 15
points and the 10th-place finisher receives 1 point. During interme-
diate sprints, the first three riders to pass designated lines receive
6, 4, and 2 points.
The best climber competition has similar point totals. Points are
doubled for the final climb in each mountain stage.
Winning stages doesn’t 
equal winning the Tour
A rider can win a dozen stages and not win the Tour de France.
How is that possible? Suppose a cyclist wins all these stages by 1
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
30

minute each. He’d accumulate at least a 12-minute margin and vari-
ous bonus times. But there’s still a good chance he wouldn’t win 
the race. The reason: With one bad day, a rider can easily lose 30
minutes in a mountain stage. It’s unlikely a rider who wins 12 stages
would lose a half-hour in one day, but it can easily happen if a rider
gets sick, crashes, or misses a key break at the front of the race. In
rare instances, overall Tour winners haven’t won any stages. Yet,
their strategic stage finishes give them the lowest cumulative time
in the field.
Getting to Know Jerseys
Cyclists are minimalists — at least when it comes to attire. They
have bicycles, of course, but riders’ apparel is simple and stream-
lined. A pair of shoes and socks are required, and also a well-fitting
pair of shorts and a jersey.
Like a well-tailored suit, proper jerseys mean a lot to cyclists in the
Tour de France, as in any other race. Nearly all riders wear identi-
cally designed jerseys that differ by the sponsors’ names on them.
In addition, the race leader and the other race competition leaders
wear different colored jerseys, but their primary sponsors’ logos
still appear on their jerseys.
What’s a jersey and why not
just wear a T-shirt?
Woolen jerseys were once all the rage at the Tour de France, but
tight-fitting Lycra/Spandex and other high-tech polyester materials
have been the standard for many years. Jerseys are made with a
lightweight synthetic fabric that has great elasticity and contours to
varying body shapes; it’s often referred to as a cyclist’s second skin.
Because of their tight fit, jerseys are very aerodynamic. During
road stages, cyclists wear separate jerseys and shorts, but in time
trials, races in which every second counts, cyclists wear one-piece
skinsuits. Some newly developed skinsuits actually have different
thicknesses in different areas to further enhance aerodynamics.
How did this jersey thing
start anyway?
Pictures from early Tour de France years show riders dressed
like businessmen pedaling to their offices. Like early professional
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 31

golfers, cyclists at the turn of the 20th century wore knickers, dress
shirts, bow ties, and suit coats. But riders soon figured out more
appropriate attire. A Tour race picture from 1905 shows French race
pioneers Lucien Petit Breton and Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq side-by-
side on their bikes at the race start. Both riders are wearing short,
above-the-knee, tight-fitting woolen pants and form-fitting long-
sleeve woolen jerseys.
Brightly single-colored or striped jerseys remained standard until
1919, when race director Henri Desgrange instituted the first signif-
icant apparel change. As a marketing tool, Desgrange introduced a
yellow jersey. It designated the race leader and it also matched the
color of L’Auto, the newspaper Desgrange published, which was
printed on yellow paper.
How many jerseys are used
during the race?
In early Tour years, cyclists’ uniforms were limited, and riders
sometimes looked like they slept in their riding clothes. Compare
that to today, when Tour riders wear clean outfits every day. Who
wants a corporate logo looking all dirty?
Cyclists usually wear the same jersey for a complete stage, even
when shorts or jerseys tear or become muddy, salt-stained, or
bloodied during races. Exceptions occur after crashes. It’s
common to see riders complete stages with holes in their shorts
and jerseys, but if tears are too large or prevent a rider from con-
tinuing, riders change jerseys. A rider can fall back from the pelo-
ton and change his jersey while on his bike, or he can momentarily
stop at a team car for a replacement pair of shorts.
Cyclists who compete in the Tour are on top teams, and these
teams can provide a single rider with up to 275 pieces of clothing
per year — approximately 20 to 30 short-sleeve jerseys alone.
Teams provide extra clothing during the three-week race, but
riders are so sentimental that they wear the same clothing every
day (washed, of course).
Showing sponsors’ logos
One of the Tour’s most anticipated scenes is a stage winner’s pro-
tocol as he approaches a finish line. In a sprint finish, there’s not
much time to react. But a cyclist with a substantial lead near a
finish doesn’t have to worry about being caught. As such, there’s
plenty of time to prepare for the throng of photographers, televi-
sion camera operators, and spectators waiting at the finish line.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
32

Tour de France cyclists know the importance of winning a stage
and how much it pleases sponsors and team officials and advances
their respective careers. Some stage winners develop finishing cel-
ebrations that are as elaborate as cheerleaders’ routines. Other
cyclists prefer more subtle approaches. But all pending Tour stage
winners know that, as they cross the line, it’s best to have their
apparel and equipment in good view to show the sponsors’ logos.
During hot days, Tour riders pedal for hours with their jerseys par-
tially or completely unzipped. But a cyclist about to win or claim a
top-three finish does himself and his team a disservice if he forgets
one final important finish-line tradition. That’s right: It may be 100
degrees, and a pending stage winner may be exhausted, dehy-
drated, or sick, but he’s not likely to forget to zip up his jersey in
the final meters of a winning stage. The reason? Stage winners and
other top finishers not only have their images in thousands of pub-
lications, but sponsors also use the same shots to promote their
products and services.
If a stage winner forgets to zip up his jersey as he nears the finish
line, the names of his various sponsors aren’t likely to be readily
visible. It’s a mistake that could help sway a company from not
renewing its contract because of lack of media exposure.
Explaining the Overall General
Classification
Every day during the Tour, riders’ finishing times as well as any
bonus or penalty seconds are calculated and recorded as overall
or General Classification times. Overall standings and General
Classification are synonymous terms, but race organizers and
cycling enthusiasts most often use the preferred General
Classification, or shorten it to just GC. Finishing times of all stages
and the Prologue are cumulative, so that the rider with the lowest
accumulated total time (factoring in bonus times and penalties)
wins the race.
Race site computers record riders’ finishing times. Within minutes,
results are posted on the race’s official Web site, distributed to
teams, given to on-site media members, and sent electronically to
thousands of worldwide media outlets. Results that are available
immediately after stages are partial, unofficial results and include
stage and General Classification times of only the leading finishers.
Particularly in mountains stages, when an hour may separate the
first and final finisher, official results aren’t available until all riders’
times, as well as bonus points or penalty times, are calculated.
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 33

Official times are distributed at the race and around the world
within a larger packet of results that includes individual stage plac-
ings and best climber, best sprinter, best young rider, and team
results. Additional race information — from medical reports to the
next day’s team departure protocol — is also included.
The yellow jersey
As a man of marketing savvy and gimmicks, race director Henri
Desgrange introduced the yellow jersey to the Tour de France in
1919. The tradition has remained since Eugene Christophe wore it
in its debut while assuming the overall race lead after the 10th
stage to Grenoble.
The yellow jersey, or maillot jaune, allows the rest of the field, spec-
tators, and media to easily identify the race leader (see Figure 3-1,
although, admittedly, it’s hard to see the color in a black-and-white
photo; see the color section near the center of this book for a
better sense of the brightness of the yellow jersey). But in its first
year, the yellow jersey was hardly necessary to make the leader
stand out. Christophe assumed the race lead after the fourth stage,
but when he donned the jersey the first time, only 11 of 69 race
starters remained for the final two stages. With the Tour’s current
larger fields, spotting the race leader is more difficult, particularly
for network television camera operators, so the yellow jersey is
more appreciated.
Figure 3-1: Lance Armstrong in the yellow jersey in Villard-de-Lans.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
34

A new yellow jersey is awarded on the finish podium after every
stage to the leader of the overall race standings. If the overall
leader remains the same for two or more stages, the race leader
doesn’t just keep the same jersey; he gets a new one for every day
he holds the race lead.
If two or more riders have the same general classification time, the
tenths and hundreds of seconds recorded in individual time trial
stages are added to riders’ overall times. Two additional tiebreaker
calculations are used, if necessary:
 First tiebreaker: The rider with the lowest total number after
adding his Prologue and stage finishing places together wins.
 Second tiebreaker: The rider with the lowest finish place
among the tied riders in the final stage wins.
Only three riders have won the Tour de France while leading from
start to finish. Maurice Garin won all six stages of the inaugural
event in 1903. The maillot jaune didn’t debut for another 16 years,
so Garin never wore the yellow jersey. Instead, as race leader, he
wore a green armband. Ottavio Bottechia of Italy held or was tied
for the lead in every stage of the 1924 Tour, and accordingly had the
yellow jersey for all 15 stages. German riders Nicolas Frantz (1928)
and Romain Maes (1935) also won the Tour while leading start to
finish. The Tour had 22 stages in 1928 and 21 stages in 1935.
The polka-dot jersey for climbing
Introduced in 1975, the polka-dot jersey, or maillot aux pois rouges,
is worn each day by the rider leading the best climber — or King of
the Mountains — competition. The polka-dot jersey (see Figure 3-2)
is reminiscent of horse racing jockeys’ attire, but like other Tour jer-
seys, the best climber jersey design began as a marketing concept.
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 35
Respect for the yellow
There’s a lot of respect for the yellow jersey. Although Team ONCE from Spain usu-
ally has the same color yellow in its jerseys, for several years of the Tour, they have
donned entirely new uniforms in pink, just to show respect for yellow and not to
confuse spectators.

Figure 3-2: Richard Virenque in the polka-dot jersey on the Champs Élysées.
The jersey was introduced when a chocolate manufacturer was a
major race sponsor. One of the sponsor’s best-known chocolate
bars had a white wrapper with red spots. The race and sponsor
quickly came up with an idea: A jersey with the same white back-
ground and red polka dots would provide additional exposure for
the sponsor. The polka-dot jersey was born.
Like the other jerseys, a polka-dot jersey is awarded after each
stage to the leader of the mountain climbers’ standings. He wears
it during the following stage.
Determining the yellow jersey competition is easy, but the King
of the Mountains category has an elaborate calculation of points,
each awarded in a different way on all mountain climbs. Riders in
contention for the polka-dot jersey title must finish the Tour.
 On the most difficult mountains, called Beyond Category or hors
categorie, points are awarded from 1st through 10th place as
follows: 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, and 5 points, respectively.
 In the next most difficult climbs, called Category 1 climbs,
points are distributed for the first eight places: 15, 13, 11, 9,
8, 7, 6, and 5.
 In Category 2 climbs, points are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 for the first
six riders to finish.
 In Category 3 climbs, points are 4, 3, 2, and 1.
 In Category 4 climbs, points are 3, 2, and 1.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
36

Note that for the final Beyond Category and Categories 1 and 2
climbs of stages, points are doubled.
If there’s a points tie in the final climbing classification, the cyclist
with the most first-place finishes in Beyond Category climbs wins.
If there’s still a tie, victory is awarded to the rider with the most
first-place finishes in Category 1 climbs. The same process is used,
if necessary, in Categories 2, 3, and 4.
The green jersey for sprinting
To help celebrate the Tour’s 50th anniversary, the green jersey, or
maillot vert, was introduced in 1953 in Strasbourg. It rewards the
cyclist with the most points. Points are awarded during intermit-
tent sprint locations in the Prologue and stages as well as in finish-
ing sprints. Each day, the points leader is awarded a green jersey
(see Figure 3-3, although in a black-and-white photo, colors are,
admittedly, tough to see), and like other jersey honorees, he wears
the jersey in the next day’s stage. Points are awarded in road races,
time trials, and in intermediate stage sprints, called hot spots.
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 37
Richard Virenque: King of climbers
Richard Virenque, a native of Morocco and a naturalized French citizen, is among
the most popular and controversial cyclists in Tour history. He’s also the race’s most
decorated climber after he claimed the polka-dot jersey for a record seventh time
in 2004. French cycling fans revered Virenque, who in the fall of 2004 retired at age
34. For more than a decade, race spectators etched Virenque’s name on mountain-
top roads throughout the race.
But this superior mountain climber who finished as high as second overall (1997) was
also involved in the sport’s infamous drug scandal in 1998. Festina, a team sponsored
by the watch manufacturer, was disqualified during the race for using performance-
enhancing drugs. Virenque and teammate Pascal Herve were the only team members
who didn’t admit to the offense.
More than two years later, in the team’s court trial, Virenque confessed. He was
suspended from cycling for nine months. When he returned, the French public forgot
the doping incident and collectively embraced Virenque.
Virenque’s Tour wins were all in mountain stages, and he captured wins in his final
three Tours: 2002, 2003, and 2004. En route to his record-setting King of the
Mountains title, Virenque rode to a 10th-stage solo win on Bastille Day, the July 14th
national French holiday.

Figure 3-3: Robbie McEwen in the green jersey on L’Alpe d’Huez.
 For flat stages, awarded points are 35, 30, 26, 24, 22, 20, 19, 18,
17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 for the 1st
through 25th-place riders.
 In rolling stages, points are 25, 22, 20, 18, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 for the first 20 riders.
 In mountain stages, points are 20, 17, 15, 13, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 for the first 15 riders.
 In individual time trial stages, points are 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, and 1 for the top ten riders.
 During intermediate stage sprints, points are 6, 4, and 2
points for the first three riders.
The green jersey competition, like other jersey competitions, has
detailed criteria to break ties. If riders share an equal place in a
stage, they’re awarded the total number of points divided by the
number of riders involved in the tie. If that number is a fraction, it’s
rounded up.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
38

In the General Classification points totals, ties are broken based on
a rider’s total stage wins, second-place finishers, and so on until
one rider has a greater number of finishes. Like the yellow and
polka-dot jerseys, a rider must finish the Tour to place in the over-
all points classification.
Germany’s Erik Zabel, who rides for the T-Mobile squad, holds the
Tour record for green jersey titles. He won six straight years, begin-
ning in 1996.
Being young has its advantages:
The white jersey
To recognize skilled young riders, the Tour introduced the white
jersey, or maillot blanc, in 1975. Sometimes known as the young
rider’s yellow jersey, it’s awarded after every stage to the highest-
placed cyclist 25 years of age or younger (as of January 1 in each
Tour year). The highest placed young rider in the final overall
standings claims the race’s final white jersey (see Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-4: Thomas Voeckler in the white jersey on L’Alpe d’Huez.
Race organizers dropped the overall white jersey competition in
1988, but still awarded a prize to the best overall young rider.
The white jersey was subsequently reinstated and has since been
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 39

claimed by several of the Tour’s finest riders — Jan Ullrich of
Germany (1996 to 1998), Marco Pantani of Italy (1994 and 1995),
Oscar Sevilla of Spain (2001), and Ivan Basso of Italy (2002).
Because many Tour riders mature approaching their late 20s, it’s
rare for a cyclist to claim the yellow and white jerseys in the same
year. But it happens. Laurent Fignon of France was the first rider to
claim both jerseys in 1983, when he won the first of his two Tour
titles at age 23. Jan Ullrich was also age 23 when he captured the
Tour and the white jersey in 1997.
Standing on the Podium (and
Kissing the Podium Girls)
After every stage, the day’s winner, race leader, and leaders of all
other race jersey colors are required to attend the postrace cere-
mony. The stage winner receives flowers and other gifts. Dozens of
race photographers take images of riders, and spectators loudly
cheer, particularly when a French rider is on the podium.
To present podium awards, four attractive women are hired each
year by Credit Lyonnais, a French bank that sponsors the yellow
jersey and has been a Tour partner since 1981. The women are offi-
cially known as hostesses, but everyone calls them podium girls
(see Figure 3-5).
Figure 3-5: Thomas Voeckler receiving victory kisses from podium girls on
Plateau de Beille.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
40

Through the years, podium girls’ presentations have become an
increasingly popular part of post-stage proceedings. Cycling Web
sites post pictures of podium girls and ask readers to pick favorites.
Tour riders are well aware of podium girls, too. Tour rules forbid
cyclists to date podium girls, but it happens. If a relationship devel-
ops, the podium girl is asked to resign. In fact, several Tour riders
and former podium girls are married and have children.
Receiving awards and accolades
Post-race ceremonies follow tradition and protocol via the Tour’s
Regulations of the Race or Reglement de l’epreuve. The awards cer-
emony begins a few minutes after every stage, and the finishing
city’s mayor or his or her appointed representative leads the cer-
emony and is joined by race dignitaries.
Awards are presented in the following order:
 Stage winner
 Leader of the General Classification, who receives the yellow
jersey
 Leader of the points competition, who receives the green
jersey
 Leader of the best climber competition, who receives the
polka-dot jersey
 Leader of the best young rider competition, who receives the
white jersey
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 41
Who gets to keep all the stuff?
Tour de France race leaders have plenty to worry about without keeping track of a
healthy supply of flowers and stuffed lions. But because it’s common for Tour race
leaders to retain the yellow jersey for several days, the Tour leader has to decide
what to do with a healthy supply of flowers and stuffed lions.
In many cases, race leaders give their flowers and lions to friends or family at the
race. If that’s not an option, a rider can give his awards to spectators or have a team
representative bring the gifts to the team hotel for safekeeping or for distribution at
another time.

Riders present on the podium must follow various protocol: They
can’t wear glasses, other than corrective lenses, nor can they wear
helmets. In addition, most teams implement their own dress code
for podium appearances that’s more stringent than the Tour rules.
Award winners refusing to participate in awards ceremonies (or at
starting ceremonies) are penalized, unless they can give extenuat-
ing circumstances for their absences.
Giving flowers and stuffed lions
The race leader is presented with a bouquet of flowers and a toy,
stuffed lion after every stage. Two of the four podium girls (they
rotate daily responsibilities in pairs) distribute awards. One podium
girl presents the lion, the other the flowers. The podium girl who
presents the gift and its recipient then kiss on the cheeks.
The Honor of the Lanterne Rouge
Since the inaugural Tour, the last-place finisher has been bestowed
with a dubious but respected honor — the lanterne rouge or red
lantern (sometimes also called the red light). The name is derived
from the red lantern on a caboose — the last car of a train. The
cyclist who finishes every stage within the designated time limit (a
set time in which a rider has to finish to remain eligible — see the
“Meeting time limits” section for brief details and Chapter 5 for the
official rules on time limits) and is last in the overall standings at
the end of the race is not only tough, he’s revered.
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
42
From glory to shame
While being the lanterne rouge has its glory, being disqualified does not. Tour
cyclists, teams, and team personnel can be disqualified for reasons beyond com-
petition, according to general principles of the race. Disqualification reasons include
 Infringement of French law
 Infringement of the Tour de France ethical code
 Indecent dress or unsuitable behavior
 Acts of vandalism during or outside of the race
 Failure to use transportation provided by the Tour during transfer days
 Customs violations

Arsene Millocheau had a lot of difficulty during the first Tour, but
he managed to finish as the 21st and final finisher from the starting
field of 60. In modern Tours, Millocheau would have been elimi-
nated, based on various stage time restrictions. But in 1903, finish-
ing 2 days, 16 hours, 47 minutes, and 22 seconds behind the winner
was acceptable. The event was new, and who knew how long it
would take to complete? Millocheau’s ordeal established the stan-
dard, and his epic journey remains the largest margin between the
winner and lanterne rouge in Tour history.
From shame to glory
Through the years, the lanterne rouge has become increasingly
popular. Riders unlikely to gain prestige during the Tour at the
front of the peloton or in jersey competitions figure the only
remaining place to seek glory is at the back of the peloton. In fact,
the winner of the lanterne rouge not only gets his share of notori-
ety, the Tour has offered various prize monies for the honor. Time
limits have changed the approach somewhat, however.
Working hard to keep last place
The lanterne rouge honor has become so popular at times during the
Tour that cyclists seeking the title have done nearly anything they
could to claim the title. Before Tour officials instituted stage time
limits, riders stopped en route to the finish line in their attempt to
finish last and lose additional time to the race leader.
The lanterne rouge is no longer an official designation at the Tour,
but many riders endure injury and illness to remain in the event in
order to make lanterne rouge history. The last official finisher has
the respect of his peers and race fans, and official or not, he’s still
often called the lanterne rouge.
Riding in the Broom Wagon
Tour cofounder Henri Desgrange had great innovations, and his
visions were often simultaneously respectful and direct. In 1910, to
fetch cyclists abandoning the race, Desgrange introduced the broom
wagon or la voiture balai. The broom wagon (a van for many years,
but now a recreational vehicle) progresses along every road race at
the rear of the race. Through the years, brooms have been attached
to the vehicle in various ways as symbolic yet cruel icons: Riders
who need to leave the race are “swept” off the course.
Chapter 3: The Races within the Race 43

The broom wagon has remained part of the Tour since its incep-
tion. It’s the last vehicle in a caravan of race vehicles, with the
exception of police cars or motorcycles. No rider wants to ride in
the broom wagon, because it signifies the end of their Tour partici-
pation for the year. Riding in the broom wagon is also the most
conspicuous way to abandon the race. Television cameras like
broom wagon footage, and every Tour spectator knows exactly
what’s happening when a cyclist enters the vehicle. If a rider aban-
doning the race is fortunate, he can less conspicuously leave the
race in his team car.
Abandoning the race — and why
Finishing the Tour is a career highlight for many cyclists, and aban-
doning the race is a rider’s least favorite option. Injury, illness, fin-
ishing outside of time limits, and drug test offenses are primary
reasons for riders’ departures.
Since the Tour returned following WWII in 1947, the finishing per-
centage of riders has rarely been below 50 percent. On the day a
rider retires from the race, his status appears on post-race results
with either the designation DNS (did not start) or DNF (started, but
did not finish).
Injuries and illness take some riders out of the Tour, and the start-
ing field can dramatically thin out as the race moves into mountain
stages. Cyclists are sometimes strung across mountain ranges, and
a race that’s been close for a week or more can suddenly change.
Often, the reason for leaving the race is that time limits weren’t met.
Meeting time limits
Unlike early years of the Tour, riders must finish stages within a
certain percentage of time after stage winners, depending upon the
severity of the stage. Road stages are defined as no particular diffi-
culty (Coefficient 1), medium difficulty (Coefficient 2), and particu-
lar difficulty (Coefficient 3). Each coefficient has a detailed chart of
averaging finishing speeds and a corresponding time percentage
in which riders have to finish to avoid elimination. If the winner’s
average speed is between 31 and 32 kilometers per hour (19.23 and
19.85 miles per hour), all finishers have to finish within 12 percent
of the winner’s time. The faster the winner’s average speed, the
larger the time gap allowed.
During extremely mountainous stages (Coefficient 4), the finishing
deadline varies from 9 percent to 21 percent of the stage winner’s
time, with increasing allowances ranging from a finishing time of no
Part I: A Bicycle Race Unlike Any Other 
44

more than 28 to 40 kilometers per hour. In time trials (Coefficient 5),
all riders must finish within 25 percent of the winner’s finishing time
to avoid elimination. In uphill time trials or time trials with “special
circumstances” (Coefficient 6), all riders must finish within 33 per-
cent of the winner’s time to avoid elimination.
Coefficients and various time percentages are followed strictly, but
exceptions are common for many reasons. Permitted finishing times
can be changed at the discretion of race officials for various weather
conditions, a road blockage, natural disaster, or a serious accident.
Race officials also have the direction to extend elimination times
for the good of the race, either for a group of riders or for individu-
als. Examples include the following:
 If more than 20 percent of the field is eliminated via standard
criteria, finishing time limits can be extended (the riders are
savvy enough to collect themselves together to make larger
groups and ride more slowly, knowing they won’t be elimi-
nated because the group is too big).
 A particularly unique average stage speed.
 The point in which an accident has occurred.
 The effort made by the rider(s) who failed to finish within the
permitted time.
 The severity of the course.
Surrendering a race number
When a cyclist abandons the race, he surrenders his race numbers
to a race official in the broom wagon or in another manner, if nec-
essary. If a rider resigns from the race for a reason determined
unjustified, race officials can withhold prize money previously
earned in the race.
Disqualified riders or riders abandoning the race may not partici-
pate in any other part of the race or in any other cycling competi-
tion during the duration of the Tour.

N
early 200 cyclists begin the Tour de France, but not
that many ﬁnish it. In this part, you discover riders’
roles and how individuals’ skills ﬁt into cycling as a team
sport. What makes a cyclist a climbing specialist, a sprint-

cyclists help themselves and their team when they do
their jobs?
In this part, you also ﬁnd out about the many and varied
team personnel helping riders get through the race — on
and off their bikes. Race rules are explained, as well as

T
he Tour de France sometimes looks like a huge group of indi-
vidual riders pedaling across the country, every man for him-
self. Cyclists operate their own bicycles with the strength of their
own lungs and legs. But individuals’ talents, while impressive, are
misunderstood.
Multiday and multiweek cycling events, called stage races, are team
affairs. Individuals can’t enter the Tour de France; only teams rep-
resenting corporate sponsors and sanctioned by Union Cycliste
Internationale, the sport’s international governing body based in
Geneva, Switzerland, can compete. While dozens of professional
teams race worldwide, the challenge to get selected to ride in the
Tour is nearly as intense as the race competition.
Only 21 or 22 teams, each with nine riders, are chosen to participate
in the three-week event. Beginning in 2005, the newly organized
ProTour will automatically include 20 selected top international
teams for the Grand Tours (Tour de France, Tour of Italy, and Tour of
Spain) and for other key races. Tour de France organizers may also
select one or two wildcard teams.
Every team is also more than just its riders. Just like in baseball,
basketball, football, hockey, and NASCAR, cycling teams have
owners, managers, assistant managers, trainers, mechanics, and
various other support staff members.
This chapter explains the inner workings of a team. You find out
how a team is organized, who’s in charge, and how the cyclists and
non-riding team members work together before, during, and after
each day’s stage. You also get the lowdown on the roles of each

team’s riders and what all the other people around the team are
doing, day in and day out, for three weeks.
What’s Team Got to Do with It?
Riders on every Tour de France team wear jerseys emblazoned
with various sponsors’ names and logos. Many teams have one
or two title sponsors (major sponsors), and then they allow other
companies to buy the rights for smaller advertisements on riders’
shorts and jerseys. It’s the cycling equivalent to NASCAR or
Formula 1 racecar advertising. If space is available on a rider’s
jersey, it’s prime promotional real estate. When careening down-
hill, or around corners, at high speeds, or struggling and profusely
sweating while inching up difficult climbs, Tour cyclists are bill-
boards on wheels.
Cycling team title sponsors, who give racing squads (another word
for teams) multi-million-dollar budgets, are as varied as the terrain
of France. Coffee machine manufacturers, floor covering compa-
nies, and even national lotteries of European nations all sponsor
pro teams competing in the Tour. The squads are called interna-
tional trade teams. Some squads have riders all from one country,
like the Spanish Euskaltel-Euskadi team, with riders all from the
Basque region of Spain. But most teams, like the 2005 sponsored
U.S.-based team (The Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team), have
cyclists from many countries and who speak several different lan-
guages. The only exceptions are during the World Championships
and Summer Olympics — during these prestigious events, riders
represent their native countries and wear national attire.
Does the guy in yellow 
win every stage?
The yellow jersey, or the maillot jaune, is the most coveted jersey in
the Tour de France (see Chapter 3). The cyclist leading the race —
that is, the cyclist who has the lowest cumulative time — wears it
each day.
The cyclist wearing the yellow jersey is a marked man. Every rider,
every spectator, and every television camera filming the race
knows the exact location of the race leader.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
50

During his six consecutive Tour de France wins, Lance Armstrong
has worn the yellow jersey for more than 60 days. That’s about half
of the days he has raced during his title years. It’s not the goal of
the yellow jersey wearer to win every stage, though; in fact, when
American Greg LeMond won the Tour in 1990, he didn’t win any
stages. The idea is to attempt to win only on days when it’s strate-
gically prudent, and more importantly, to win the Tour overall.
Riding for dollars
Every cyclist in the Tour has a yearly salary. But the race also offers
an elaborate prize money structure. In recent years, the overall race
winner has earned 400,000 euros, about $480,000. The total purse of
the event is three million euros, or $3,750,000, plus sponsor incen-
tives and bonuses. Individual prize money at each stage is awarded
deep into the standings. The team competition and overall stand-
ings also have prize money. Races within the race — most aggres-
sive rider, best sprinter, best climber, and best young rider (under
age 25) competitions — all have prize money, too. See Chapter 3 for
more on these competitions.
Riders have additional incentives to sprint for midstage perform-
ance bonuses — the French word primes (pronounced preems). A
cyclist on a long solo lead wins a prime when he crosses a pre-
determined point of stage first. Cyclists with the ability to acceler-
ate quickly, or sprint, for short distances also often earn primes.
They move to the front of the peloton within a few hundred meters
of a prime location and pedal furiously to cross the line first. In the
first week of the Tour — before the mountains arrive — these
bonuses also allow riders not in contention for the overall title a
chance to wear the yellow jersey, at least for a short while.
Chapter 4: It’s All about the Team 51
Armstrong spreads his wealth
Lance Armstrong’s cycling career made him wealthy. But like other Tour de France
winners, he doesn’t ride thinking about the race prize money. Instead, triumphant
cyclists in the Tour greatly benefit financially via increased sponsorship and
endorsement deals, not from the money presented by the Tour itself.
Each time he has won the Tour, Armstrong has not accepted the winner’s share of
the purse. As per tradition, he has taken his winnings and put them back into the
total amount of the team’s winnings. This total is divided among his teammates and
other support staff.

Many mid-stage sprints in Tour de France stages don’t offer addi-
tional prize money, but do offer bonus points. These intermediate
sprints are included in most stages and are designated in the
course profile. Riders who cross the line in the top-three positions
are respectively rewarded six, four, and two points and are likely
interested in the race’s best sprinter competition (the green jersey,
the second most prestigious competition in the Tour — see
Chapter 3). Riders seeking bonus points do so at risk, sometimes in
a furious pack-filled sprint at nearly 50 mph (80 kph). Completing
each day’s stage is hard enough, but sprinting for short bursts at
top speeds during a stage quickly zaps a rider’s energy.
Selecting a Team — All Shapes,
Sizes, and Skills
The nine cyclists selected to compete for each Tour de France
team represent only part of each international trade team. Most
international pro trade teams have at least 20 riders; some have
more than 25 cyclists on their rosters. Riders selected to partici-
pate in the Tour are chosen based on their varying skills. Each
team’s management also chooses riders by considering their per-
sonalities and abilities to get along with teammates. The Tour is a
team event, and the team’s synergy and dynamics must be heavily
considered — much like a business. One key to a team’s success is
cycling’s equivalent of business world terminology. In short, are
the cyclists team players?
The ideal Tour de France team includes a team leader, the squad’s
best overall rider. At his best, the team leader is in contention for
the race overall title, called the General Classification (or GC). Some
teams are so strong that they have two members who, depending
on how the race develops, are capable to compete for the overall
title or a very high finish.
Not every team has a superstar like Lance Armstrong or Germany’s
Jan Ullrich, who won the race in 1997 and has finished second five
other times. Without a cyclist capable of competing for the overall
crown, some teams enter the race fielding riders who seek individ-
ual stage wins. Other teams hope only for titles in sub competi-
tions, such as the best climber, best sprinter, best young rider, and
team competition, within the overall race.
In addition to team leaders and specialist riders (those who are capa-
ble of winning particular stages, like sprints or climbs), teams have
riders who are generalists. They know the event well and are prima-
rily responsible to ride in support of the team leader. Given the
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
52

chance, these riders could also race to win individual stages. But
they’re primarily chosen for one overwhelming characteristic —
selflessness.
Injuries, illness, fatigue, and elimination via time limits (discussed
in Chapter 5) deplete many teams. By the end of the race, in Paris,
some squads are grateful just to have their riders complete the
final day while still being coherent and upright on their bikes.
While Lance Armstrong would be disappointed to just finish the
Tour de France, for many cyclists, crossing the final finish line of
the sport’s most difficult race on the cobblestones of the Champs
Élysées is a career highlight.
The team leader
Only a handful of cyclists who enter the Tour de France each year
have a legitimate chance to win. Surprises occur, but top con-
tenders are usually well-known riders with vast experience and
multiple talents. Cyclists who win the Tour de France are great
climbers and have superior abilities in time trials, the races timed
individually against the clock.
Team leaders don’t have any standard body style or characteris-
tics, other than possessing a low body fat percentage and extreme
fitness. Miguel Indurain of Spain won the Tour de France for five
consecutive years ending in 1995. During his career, Indurain car-
ried 175 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame. Armstrong weighs about
160 pounds and is 5-foot-10.
Team leaders advance through cycling ranks just like rookies and
younger players in other pro sports. A pending team leader com-
petes for a few years, honing his skills with the hope of advancing
into a team leader’s role as he matures into his mid to late 20s.
Many team leaders endure failure early in their careers, however.
Indurain didn’t finish the Tour de France in his first two attempts
in 1985 and 1986. Armstrong withdrew from the event in his first
two attempts in 1993 and 1994 as well as in 1996. He has completed
the race seven times in ten appearances; Indurain finished the race
ten times in twelve attempts.
Tour de France team leaders improve their chances for success if
they have a good relationship with their teammates throughout the
rest of the season. Armstrong has won many other races, but the
Tour is his top priority. During less prestigious one-day races or
shorter stage races leading up to the Tour, Armstrong often rides
in a supportive role for his teammates. And when cycling’s grand
event arrives in July, guess what? Armstrong’s teammates don’t
forget what he’s done for them. The Tour is Armstrong’s time to
Chapter 4: It’s All about the Team 53

reap the benefits. His teammates are doing their jobs only if they
ride to support him.
The climbers
Cold and rainy, overcast and snowy, or hot and sun-baked — it
doesn’t matter. Tour de France fans flock to the mountaintops of
the Alps and the Pyrenees for one reason: to witness great climbers
and not-so-great climbers.
Unlike in some sports, in which the athletes’ bodies and faces are
hidden by gear or helmets, the emotions of riders climbing steep
grades in the Alps and Pyrenees are in plain view. It’s high drama,
and for cycling fans it’s well worth the wait — rain, snow, or shine.
Great climbers appear as if they’re practicing Zen meditation.
They’re focused, in control of their emotions, and completely in
sync with their efficient bodies. Great climbers are often smaller in
stature than the rest of the field, but not always. Regardless of size,
the best climbers have the ability to produce vast amounts of
power for extended lengths of time.
Back-of-the-pack riders, on the other hand, struggle on steep moun-
tain roads. They waver from side to side; their energy is depleted.
The biggest time gaps between the front and back of the pack occur
in the mountains. More than an hour sometimes separates leading
climbers’ finishing times from those struggling and hoping only to
finish and avoid time elimination (discussed in Chapter 3).
Timing and patience are the integral components of how a climber
in the Tour plans his moves. If a race finishes with a long, extended
ascent, the riders with the best climbing skills rely on teammates to
pace them as far as they can. The best climbers then forge ahead
alone to battle both other riders and the rigors of the mountain.
The sprinters
The first week of the Tour de France traditionally includes several
consecutive days of flat stages. It’s the best time of the race for
sprinters, the cyclists who have the uncanny ability to quickly
accelerate their bikes to more than 40 mph (65 kph).
Sprinters are the most muscular-looking and often the most oppor-
tunistic cyclists in the race. During flat stages, riders compete strate-
gically with the flow of the day, slow if the group is unmotivated, fast
if the peloton is spirited. Each team’s riders attempt to surround
their designated sprinter as the race enters the final mile(s).
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
54

As the riders, en masse, jockey for position at the front, the pre-
mier sprinters do their best to follow just behind. If they’ve coordi-
nated their efforts correctly, each team positions rider after rider
just in front of their sprinter. The support riders each take turns
for short, quick bursts of acceleration as the race’s waning
stretches approach. These bursts are called the lead-out and
accomplish two things:
 The lead-out discourages riders from breaking out to the
front, because it keeps the pace high and consistent.
 The lead-out allows the designated sprinter to draft (reduce
the wind for) the riders in front until the last possible second,
and then sprint on his own for the win.
For sprinters, it’s like getting a high-speed police escort by several
vehicles. Imagine each officer taking a turn at the front of a single-
file caravan, leading you in your vehicle to the local mall or gro-
cery store. One by one, each police vehicle pulls to the side and
another vehicle goes to the front. Within seconds of your designa-
tion, all the police cars are gone and you get to go as fast as you
can — legally — to your arrival point. Sprinters’ final furious
assaults occur within the final few hundred meters of a stage. With
their escorts gone, sprinters spread across the road in a blurry
combination of bodies and bikes.
Winners of sprint finishes are often victorious by a margin of inches.
Spectators may not know who has won, but the riders are so experi-
enced, they know who’s victorious — at least most of the time. The
winner dramatically thrusts one or both of his hands into the air just
Chapter 4: It’s All about the Team 55
Mario Cipollini: Best sprinter ever?
Mario Cipollini of Italy is arguably the greatest sprinter in cycling history. Flamboyant,
outspoken, and charismatic, Cipollini ruled the sprints in the Tour France and in the
Tour of Italy for more than a decade.
Cipollini is a showman, too. With a trademark wide smile and a gregarious personal-
ity, he plays to crowds throughout the world. Cipollini won the World Championship
road race in 2002, but he has primarily built his persona with furious sprint finishes. As
of the writing of this book, Cipollini has won a record 42 stages of the Tour of Italy and
12 stages of the Tour de France.
Cipollini, 37, retired once and has threatened retirement on other occasions. For
many years, he’s had a tumultuous relationship with Tour de France race director
Jean-Marie Leblanc. The reason: Cipollini has participated in the Tour de France
eight times, but he never intends to finish the race. Leblanc believes Cipollini’s
approach is disrespectful.

as he crosses the line. Sometimes, though, only photographs taken
as the racers cross the finish line can determine the winner of a
sprint finish. And on more than one occasion, a rider has made a 
victory gesture while crossing the finish line, only to find out he
didn’t win.
A common term in sprinting is called the throw, which means lung-
ing at the finish like a runner but on a bike. A bike throw can give a
sprinter a few extra inches at the finish line. And if it’s done cor-
rectly, a sprinter who looks as though he is beaten can win with a
throw.
The rouleurs
Unheralded and largely out of the limelight, most of the Tour race
field is comprised of cyclists called rouleurs. They’re the riders
who can “roll” for hours at a steady, strong pace. On windy days,
rainy days, and any other kind of day, during flat or rolling stages,
rouleurs have the most thankless jobs in the peloton.
Rouleurs are often each team’s biggest riders. They go to the front
of the race and act as windbreaks. As the cyclists in control of the
peloton, rouleurs are invaluable, yet their individual time for glory
is rare, if ever. Rouleurs use more energy than other cyclists in the
field because they don’t get the benefits of drafting; they provide
the draft for the riders on their teams who have a greater shot at
winning.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
56
Frankie Andreu: Consummate rouleur
Frankie Andreu of Dearborn, Michigan, completed the Tour de France nine times, the
current American record for finishes. He retired after the 2000 season following 12
professional years packed with hard work, little notoriety, and few victories. He now
works as a cycling television analyst for the Outdoor Life Network and writes
columns for cycling Web sites.
A two-time U.S. Olympian, Andreu was captain of the U.S. Postal Service team (now
called the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team) that propelled Lance Armstrong to
the first two of his Tour de France titles. Andreu had one second-place Tour de
France stage finish; he placed eighth in the 1988 Olympic road race in Seoul, South
Korea; and he was fourth in the Olympic road race in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996.
But Andreu primarily spent his long career as a team rider and well-respected
rouleur. Day after day, year after year, he raced at the front of the peloton on beau-
tiful days and in inclement weather. He spent a good portion of his career helping
control the pace of the Tour de France, always with his team leaders in mind.

Every team has several rouleurs. When they’re not counted on to
pedal like human battering rams, rouleurs work as domestiques or
consummate team players, sometimes going back through the
pack to the team car for bottles, food, clothing, and so on. Rouleurs
often exert so much energy during a stage that they finish low in
the stage standings. But standings don’t tell the race story. It’s
rouleurs who have likely gotten the top finishers into a position
where they can vie for the day’s honors. Rouleurs don’t get glory,
but they get a lot of respect.
The time trial specialists
Individual time trials have the most direct and appropriate name of
the Tour de France: They’re called the Race of Truth, because riders
advance via their own skills and without the benefit of drafting. Time
trials range from short Prologue distances of 8 kilometers (5 miles)
to more than 50 kilometers (31.2 miles).
In individual time trials, the field competes rider by rider, with the
cyclists usually starting two minutes apart. The last rider in the
standings starts first, and the cyclist wearing the yellow jersey
begins last. Riders begin time trials with a hand countdown, sig-
naled by a referee standing next to each cyclist on a starting ramp.
The best time trialists master the ability to pedal at a sustained
high rate of speed without exceeding their cardiovascular limits.
This is why time trial specialists, and the bikes they ride, are the
epitome of cycling efficiency. Time trials require state-of-the-art
equipment. Everything from the helmet to the shoes needs to be
aerodynamic, so teams spend countless hours and money develop-
ing and refining their equipment. Cyclists ride time trial bicycles
(these ultraquick bikes are illegal to use in road stages) that have
different wheels and handlebar configurations more aerodynami-
cally aligned than their road bikes. Depending upon individual pref-
erence, a time trialist may use solid wheels, called discs, that don’t
have spokes. Time trial cyclists also wear tight booties over their
cycling shoes as another way to cut wind resistance and prompt
faster times. They also wear skintight suits, called skinsuits, that
are a one-piece, body-clinging suit with no pockets and made with
Lycra/Spandex.
Time trialists also wear elongated helmets as a mandatory safety
measure. The rear of the helmet extends farther down a rider’s
neck and back, form-fitting the contour of his upper back. This is
commonly referred to as tear-drop. The design of the futuristic
helmet helps reduce wind resistance. Time trial specialists are
often contenders for the overall race title, and their skills are
overtly apparent. Even though cyclists begin two minutes apart,
Chapter 4: It’s All about the Team 57

the best time trialists overtake slower riders, and they can average
more than 30 mph (48 kph) during the stage. In Figure 4-1, Lance
Armstrong warms up before a time trial at Stage 19 of a Tour.

LeMond’s great time trial win
Greg LeMond became the first American to win the Tour de France in 1986. He
returned to the race in 1989 after a two-year recovery from a hunting accident that
nearly took his life.
The second year he won, LeMond trailed Frenchman Laurent Fignon by 50 seconds
at the start of the final stage, a 24.5-kilometer (151⁄10-mile) individual time trial stage
that ended on the cobblestone streets of the Champs Élysées in Paris. LeMond used
two novel approaches en route to the closest overall finish in Tour history.
In modern-day time trials, riders are given their elapsed times (called splits) at des-
ignated places on the course. But LeMond told his team director he didn’t want the
distraction of knowing his time on the final day of the 1989 race. He preferred to ride
by “feel.” He went all-out from the start on a make-or-break mission.
LeMond also used now-common triathlete handlebars in the final stage, a first in
the Tour de France. The new handlebars allowed LeMond to ride in an aerodynamic
tuck, like an alpine ski racer. As the second-to-last rider on the course, LeMond
quickly narrowed his time deficiency. LeMond crossed the line in 26 minutes and 57
seconds. Fignon, the last rider on the course, finished 58 seconds later and col-
lapsed as he crossed the finish line. LeMond won the Tour de France by eight sec-
onds, and his average speed for the day was a record 54.5 kph (33.8 mph).

Recognizing the Team 
Behind the Team
Cyclists in the Tour de France don’t need help pedaling, but they
do need assistance before, during, and after each day’s racing to
allow them to showcase their talents.
For every team’s nine riders, there are seemingly an equal number
of team support personnel. Team owners, team directors, physi-
cians, chiropractors, massage therapists, trainers, cooks, mechan-
ics, media relations and sponsor representatives, and team car
drivers. They all travel with their respective teams throughout the
Tour. With the riders, the contingent comprises each squad’s sub-
stantial entourage.
While cyclists ride, teams’ complementary staffs advance through-
out the race in team cars identified with sponsors’ logos. Some
team support staff members progress through the course in the
caravan of race vehicles that follow cyclists during the entire
route. Other team personnel, media, and sponsor representatives
travel ahead of the race and prepare for the cyclists’ arrival in the
finishing city.
The directeur sportif 
(team manager)
How teams prepare and execute daily strategy during the Tour is
the responsibility of the directeur sportif, or team manager. With
some exceptions, team managers are former Tour cyclists who’ve
remained in the sport following their retirement. After years in the
peloton and with intimate knowledge of cycling nuance, team man-
agers are hired by team owners to hire the riders. Team managers
run the day-to-day operations of the team — from preseason train-
ing camps to races throughout the season.
During the Tour, every team has a directeur sportif, and many teams
have an assistant, too. Both managers have varied responsibilities,
from race strategy to cheerleader and from disciplinarian to lobby-
ist, while negotiating with Tour de France management. Team man-
agers meet with their riders daily, stay in the same hotels, and eat
the same meals. Teams usually meet at breakfast prior to the stage
and following the day’s race at dinner.
Many directeurs sportif have close relationships with their team lead-
ers. The duo collaborates on selecting key riders for races through-
out the season, including the riders from the Tour de France.
Chapter 4: It’s All about the Team 59

Team directors are positioned in their respective team cars at the
start of each stage, according to a specific starting order distrib-
uted by the race organization. As the stages progress, team cars
follow the riders with the directeur sportif communicating with his
riders via two-way radios. (Note that before two-way radios, a rider
would fade back through the peloton to ride alongside the team car
to give or collect information to relay back to his teammates in the
peloton.) Directeurs sportif have varying styles, but they all share
one common trait: They’re not shy giving directives to their teams
during a race.
Team directors maneuver through the peloton to assist team mem-
bers and further discuss strategy. Because so many vehicles follow
the riders on sometimes less-than-ideal roads, team vehicles must
advance along course routes via protocol. In addition to communi-
cating with their riders, directeurs sportif communicate with the
race director and his colleagues, who ride in vehicles at the front
of the race.
Directeurs sportif are also diplomats and opportunists. They con-
stantly look for advantages to help their teams, sometimes by
stretching the rules of race protocol. It’s common, for example, for
a rider to illegally hang on to a team vehicle while discussing race
strategy with his director. It’s also common for a rider to hang on
too long while receiving a new water bottle from a team car. Team
directors and riders try to take these little advantages when they
think race organizers aren’t looking. But after many stages,
directeurs sportif and riders are either warned or fined nominal
amounts for various course protocol infractions.
A list of the day’s infractions and the penalties levied are identified
and distributed with daily results to teams, race management, and
the media reporting on the race shortly after each stage. Race infrac-
tions and other nonresult information are written on notices called
communiqués. These infractions range from fines to time penalties,
which are worse than fines because they affect the standings of the
riders and teams.
The team mechanics
(a.k.a. wrenches)
A loose spoke or a frayed cable — that’s all it takes for a mechani-
cal problem to abruptly end a cyclist’s Tour participation. It’s also
why mechanics are so important to teams’ successes. Every Tour
team has several mechanics who work on riders’ bikes with the
precision of Swiss watchmakers.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
60

Before each stage, mechanics fine-tune riders’ racing bikes and
spare bikes, too. Operating out of trucks stocked with tools of the
trade, mechanics seemingly never stop working. This is one of the
more rigorous jobs in the Tour, offering little sleep to those who do
it. Once a stage begins, mechanics may get to rest for a while or
may immediately be called to the job if there’s an early race flat
tire, a malfunctioning gear, or a mangled bike that needs repair or
replacement.
Mechanics are on the move in every stage. When a rider has a
mechanical problem, he raises his hand to notify the team. The
mechanics quickly find their way to the scene and replace, for
example, a flat tire and wheel in a few seconds, similar to mechan-
ics in the pit crews at the Indianapolis 500.
Tour mechanics also make repairs at high speeds. When a cyclist
needs a repair, but it’s not a good time to stop, a team car
approaches the rider and a mechanic leans through a window,
tools in hand. He does his best to make repairs while his vehicle
and the cyclist travel at speeds that can exceed 40 mph (65 kph).
Cyclists’ jobs are done for the day when a stage is finished.
Mechanics’ responsibilities continue for hours after racing is
done. Tour bikes get cleaned, repaired, and tuned up after every
stage, so that they’re ready for the riders again early the next day.
The soigneurs (all-around 
assistants)
Imagine having a valet or butler at your job. Every Tour de France
team has one; they’re called soigneurs (pronounced swan-yers).
The exact job description of a soigneur is hard to define because it
varies from team to team. But one thing is certain: Soigneurs can be
called on anytime to do almost anything for a cyclist or his team.
From massage therapists to social workers, errand clerks to cooks,
maids to confidants, soigneurs work as hard as anyone at the Tour
de France, and they sleep as little as anyone at the race.
Throughout the Tour’s three weeks, soigneurs buy food, deliver
riders’ mail, organize their team’s suitcases, and negotiate for spe-
cial needs with hotel owners. If a rider needs a special favor, he
asks his team’s soigneur.
Good soigneurs have temperaments of saints. They listen to riders’
complaints. They hear all the private details of each day’s events,
Chapter 4: It’s All about the Team 61

and they’re counted on to keep private team matters private. Good
teams also reward good soigneurs with a percentage of the riders’
pooled prize money.
The masseurs
Daily massages during the Tour help cyclists revitalize their mus-
cles. Every team employs a masseur who helps in the recovery of
riders’ muscles. Massages are usually done in riders’ hotel rooms,
a few hours after every stage. Some of the best pro cyclists, includ-
ing Lance Armstrong, have personal masseurs.
The drivers: Skills, stamina,
and street smarts
In addition to team cars, ever Tour team has a bus. Cyclists arrive
at the race each day in the team bus (see Figure 4-2), and every
starting city has a special parking area for it.
Figure 4-2: The team cars and team buses arrive before the start of Stage 6 of
the 2004 Tour de France.
The race also has a huge caravan of equipment trucks that, just
like the team bus, advance city to city. Riders get the most atten-
tion, of course, but the caravan of buses and equipment trucks
have a parade-like following. After stages begin, the team buses
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
62

leave each city to crowd applause. The French public also acknowl-
edges the vehicles along the route, particularly in small country
villages, where the caravan has to negotiate narrow roads.
Several hours after stages, race barriers, banners, and barricades
are disassembled and loaded onto equipment trucks by fast-working
crews. The equipment caravan leaves en masse to travel overnight to
the next starting city. There are no cyclists, no team directors, no
music, and no race announcers. But the truck drivers toot their
horns as they’re leaving town, and the scene often attracts curious,
festive crowds.

A
large group of cyclists, pedaling along country roads and
flanked by sunflowers and vineyards, may appear tranquil.
But each day, Tour de France cyclists follow a vast set of strict
rules. Signing in at the beginning of every stage, taking mandatory
drug tests, wearing proper attire, and ensuring the proper weight
of their bikes are among the Tour’s long and varied regulations for
riders and their support staff.
Tour rules aren’t only for riders. Team personnel, race vehicle driv-
ers, and media also adhere to specific race rules, all compiled by
Tour organizers in conjunction with French law and the International
Cycling Union or Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport’s gov-
erning body. Rules of the race and rules of the road are listed in the
official Technical Guide or, as it’s often called, The Race Bible. This
chapter details all those Tour rules and day-to-day operations.
Knowing Some Important Tour
de France Regulations
Tour rules and regulations are detailed in race Articles. Listed in
the Technical Guide, they range from participation to disqualifica-
tion, medical care to prize money. Rules are written and detailed in
French and English. Because French is the universal language in

cycling (Lance Armstrong, for example, is fluent), French interpre-
tation of rules prevails in instances in which a language barrier
may cloud a definition.
Helmets: Mandatory, dude!
To reduce or eliminate deaths from crashes, every rider in the Tour
must now wear a helmet during every stage of the race, including
time trials (see Figure 5-1). At their own risk, cyclists may remove
their helmets during the final climb to the summit if the climb is at
least 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) long. A Tour course marker designates
the point on the course where cyclists can remove their helmets.
Removal of helmets on mountain stages is never allowed before the
start of a climb.
Figure 5-1: The Giro Time Trial helmet used by the U. S. Postal Service
Professional Cycling Team in the 2004 Tour de France.
Oh, no, we’re wearing 
the same outfit
Every rider must wear his team’s official outfit — shorts, jersey,
socks and shoes, gloves, and helmet. Unless a rider withdraws
prior to the event, each of the 21 participating teams has nine
riders, attired identically, at the start of the race.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
66

Several exceptions exist, however. Leaders in overall standings and
best climber (polka dot), sprinter (green), and young rider (white)
competitions wear their respective colored jersey. Each of the sub-
competition jerseys includes the appropriate team advertising ban-
ners. In individual time trials, competition leaders are provided
with appropriately colored skinsuits instead of jerseys and shorts.
If a rider leads more than one race competition, he wears the jersey
in accordance to priority of importance: yellow jersey, green jersey,
polka-dot jersey, and white jersey. The runners-up or next highest-
place riders in the competitions wear leaders’ jerseys in the remain-
ing categories.
The reigning world road race titlist wears a white jersey with hori-
zontal adjoining blue, red, black, yellow, and green bands during
the Tour. The rainbow jersey also includes the rider’s team spon-
sors’ logos. Reigning national road titlists also wear their national
champion jerseys with the same allowance for team names and
advertising banners.
Riders can wear additional clothes over or under their jerseys,
including rain gear, tights or leg warmers, or other overgarments.
And they can wear additional clothing at the start or during a
stage. A rider seeking additional attire during a stage drops back
to receive items from a team vehicle or from motorcycle drivers
designated by race organizers.
Riding by numbers
Tour riders are identified by race numbers. The defending race
champion wears No. 1, and his teammates follow in order through
No. 9. Every rider considered as his team’s overall title contender
wears the lowest number on his team. He’s listed first on all official
rider lists; from there, there’s an alphabetical order to the numbers.
Every rider must have an official double-sided number plate on
each side of his bike frame and in a designated position. Riders
must also wear two numbers, one over each hip. During individual
time trial stages, cyclists’ two small hip numbers are replaced by a
larger single number affixed on their lower back. Race organizers
provide number plates and race numbers, and they must be worn
without alterations.
Chapter 5: More Tour Rules Than You Ever Want to Know 67

Sign on the line, or you 
don’t pass start
Prior to every Tour stage, riders must sign in on a pre-race staging
area. The procedure is required in part as tradition, in part to
appease spectators gathered near the starting line, awaiting the
arrival of their favorite riders minutes before a stage start.
During road stages, riders and team managers must arrive at the
signature registration area at least ten minutes prior to a start.
Riders who don’t sign in are fined 100 Swiss Francs, or about $85.
If a rider is prevented from signing in because of traffic congestion
or another unavoidable circumstance, a fine is not levied.
After the entire field registers, the race manager begins a stage in
one of three ways;
 A standing start begins at the riders’ sign-in or signature area.
 A deferred standing start occurs if a stage begins some distance
from the sign-in area because of area restrictions.
 A rolling start or flying start occurs when a stage begins when
the cyclists casually pedal from the sign-in area, and then begin
at the stage where the course is designated as Kilometer 0
(Mile 0).
Feed zone and feeding rules
During the Tour, riders must continuously replenish foods and liq-
uids. Before, during, and after stages, cyclists’ eating and drinking
habits are reminiscent of scenes of stokers shoveling coal into
steam engines — they eat and drink that much.
Riders’ nutritional needs are the responsibility of individual teams,
with some exception. During every Tour road stage, there’s a desig-
nated area on the course called the feed zone or feeding station.
Team representatives carrying musettes, or feeding bags with sand-
wiches, fruit, and energy bars. They hand off supplies to riders as
they advance through the feed zone. It’s cycling’s version of take-
out food. New water bottles are also distributed to riders in the
feed zone, but musettes and water bottles must be those supplied
by Tour sponsors or otherwise Tour approved.
Outside the feed zone, riders in a breakaway can also receive sup-
plies from their team managers’ vehicles or a Tour-supplied motor-
cycle. Musettes and water bottles can be used in these feeding
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
68

options, but these resupply situations and the designated feed
zone must follow Tour-established regulations. Consider:
 To receive replenishment from a team car, a rider must drop
back to the vehicle, and that vehicle must be situated behind
race organizers’ vehicles.
 Feeding is permitted at the back of a group of breakaways as
long as at least 15 riders are represented in a group and as
long as it has established a sustained break from the peloton.
 Feeding is permitted during a road stage any time after the 50-
kilometer (311⁄4-mile) mark to a marker on the course designat-
ing the end of the feed zone at 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from
the stage finish.
 Radio communication from teams on the official Tour radio
frequency is not allowed in the 12 kilometers (7.4 miles)
before or in the 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) after the feed zone.
 Spraying anything from team vehicles is prohibited.
 Glass containers may not be carried or used by riders.
 Riders accepting food or beverages from spectators do so at
their own risk, which includes potential prosecution.
 Riders must throw away food, feeding bags, bottles, or any
other accessories with caution and must dispose of items on
the roadside, not on the road below. Items discarded into the
path of another cyclist can cause bodily harm or prompt a
crash.
 Race organizers can alter feeding rules for inclement weather
conditions or under other exceptional circumstances.
Team cars: Position and passing
The group of vehicles that travels with the riders in every Tour
stage is known as the caravan. Television, radio, and newspaper
journalists; race officials; police escorts; and publicity vehicles all
follow Tour regulations. Caravan vehicles are identified with vari-
ous colored stickers placed across front windshields. Priority is
given to vehicles based on race responsibility, number of occu-
pants in the vehicle, and how the vehicle is equipped.
The same rules apply for team vehicles, but team cars also have a
complicated and vast additional list of rules. Each team is assigned
a starting position as designated in the results packet from the pre-
vious day’s stage; teams are positioned in the caravan in the over-
all standings order of each team’s leading rider. Every team can
Chapter 5: More Tour Rules Than You Ever Want to Know 69

have two team vehicles following the race, and each vehicle can
have a maximum of four passengers. Passengers who have been
accredited by race organizers can join the team’s directeur sportif
and his assistants in team vehicles. Non-team passengers riding in
team vehicles must remain in their car during stages, and they’re
not permitted to aid riders or hold team equipment.
Team cars carry riders’ spare bikes, wheels, water, food, and med-
ical supplies. During the race, the primary team vehicle must be
driven by the directeur sportif on the right-hand side of the road
and in the order designated at the stage start. Each teams’ addi-
tional team car is positioned in a second group of vehicles. Teams’
second vehicles are positioned identically as the first group, but
the second group of team vehicles must be separated from the first
group by at least 200 meters (1⁄8 mile).
Every team vehicle must be equipped with a radio tuned to the
Tour’s frequency. Every team’s place in the caravan is confirmed
prior to every stage, and every team’s radio must broadcast Tour
radio throughout stages. Team vehicles must ask permission or
must receive a request from race officials to overtake a race man-
agement vehicle.
Teams must attend to their riders under Tour and Union Cycliste
Internationale rules. Fines are levied for infractions according to
the sanctions list in race regulations. In addition to race penalties,
vehicle infractions are subject to French legal action.
Staying within the time limit
Tour organizers have a pretty good idea how long every stage will
take. They’ve toured the routes numerous times while planning the
route during the preceding year. And after more than 90 race edi-
tions, race organizers know within a certain time frame how long
individual mountain ascents and descents, long and flat sections,
and wind-swept open roads will likely take. Most stages are geared
toward finishing during the nationally televised broadcast in
France, between 5 and 6 p.m.
Every route of every stage is detailed in a course itinerary distrib-
uted to every team and to every race vehicle — from equipment
trucks to publicity cars, service technicians, and the media.
Every city of every stage is designated on the itinerary according to
its kilometer distance into the stage. Stage starting times are listed,
as well as the time the peloton is expected to arrive. National and
regional French newspapers print the itinerary, so that cities’ spec-
tators know when the Tour is likely to come to their town.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
70

Tour organizers, anticipating varying weather, list expected arrival
times in each city via three average speeds. Average estimated
speeds vary depending on a stage’s terrain, motivation of riders, and
weather conditions. But one common trio of predicted finish times
is 44, 42, and 40 kilometers per hour (27.3, 26.1, and 24.8 mph).
Tour stage time estimates are surprisingly accurate, but excep-
tions occur. On some occasions, riders race particularly fast and
arrive in cities and finish sooner than expected. Stage finish times
can be underestimated by a few minutes or by more than a half-
hour for several reasons — a severe crash, extreme weather, or
particularly unmotivated riders.
Beyond city-by-city estimated arrival times, each stage itinerary
includes a topographic stage profile. It details all categorized
climbs (length and gradient), stage sprints, and feed zones. An
alternative course route from the stage start to finish of every
stage is also provided.
Race organizers diligently estimate stage times, but circumstances
can force cancellation of a stage or stages. In special circumstances,
including an accident or natural disaster, race officials may:
 Change a course route
 Temporarily halt a stage
 Consider that the stage has not been held and cancel the
results
 Cancel part of the stage, nullify intermediate stage results,
and restart a stage where an incident occurred
 Restart a stage but keep time gaps recorded to the point
where the stage was stopped
Drug testing at every stage
Every rider in the Tour is tested for banned substances prior to the
race. Various cyclists are tested after every stage, according to a
selection process determined before the race. Under current rules,
at least 180 urine drug tests are given, including daily drug tests for
the race leader and stage winner and six to eight cyclists selected
at random throughout the field.
Chapter 5: More Tour Rules Than You Ever Want to Know 71

Tour drug tests are administered in accordance with the rules
of the Union Cycliste Internationale and the French Federation of
Cycling or Federation Françoise de Cyclisme. The Tour conducts
banned substance testing under secure and strictly monitored con-
ditions. A specially equipped caravan is established near the finish
line of every stage to transport drug samples to a private location
following the race. Drug test samples are then transported by pri-
vate plane for analysis, and results are quickly reported to Tour
officials.
Who’s Keeping Score and Why?
Throughout each road race, you can often see a motorcycle with
two passengers zipping through the peloton. The driver positions
himself in various breaks in the race and reports time gaps
between two or more riders or groups of riders.
The passenger on the back of the motorcycle gets time gaps via his
radio earplug from race officials, and he notes those time gaps on a
chalkboard or time board. Gaps likely include the time between the
race leader, a chasing rider or group of riders, and a secondary
chasing group or individual rider. If time gaps between riders are

Prohibited substances
Riders participating in the Tour compete under the anti-doping drug rules estab-
lished by Union Cycliste Internationale. In addition, the World Anti-Doping
Association (WADA) does random drug-testing all year long. The list of banned sub-
stances categorizes substances and other restrictions into two categories: pro-
hibited substances and methods.
 Banned substances are divided into nine categories: anabolic steroids, hor-
mones, beta-2 agonists, agents with oestrogenic activity, diuretics and other
masking agents, stimulants, narcotics, cannabinoids, and glucocorticosteroids.
Okay, most of these words won’t mean much to you, so suffice it to say that
these are bad for the body.
 Banned methods of use categories include: enhancement of oxygen transfer,
chemical and physical manipulation, and gene doping. Again, the kind of
Frankenstein technology that serious athletes want to stay away from.
Individually banned drugs, testing regulations, athletes’ failure to cooperate, penal-
ties, and other anti-doping stipulations and rules are available on the Union Cycliste
Internationale Web site at www.uci.ch.

smaller, the time gaps aren’t as difficult to estimate without radio
report and chalkboard postings. But particularly on mountain
climbs, it’s often difficult for riders and the public to know time gaps
between riders that can be strung out across a mountain range.
Chapter 5: More Tour Rules Than You Ever Want to Know 73
Cheating and other dastardly deeds
Since the early years of the Tour, cheating has been an unfortunate part of the race.
Just like the infamous incident in the 1980 Boston Marathon when apparent winner
Rosie Ruiz was accused of taking the subway for part of the route, Tour cyclists
have been accused of various indiscretions. Ruiz was stripped of her title, and Tour
de France riders have likewise been expelled.
The first documented case of Tour cheating occurred in 1904, the race’s second
year. Ferdinand Ryan, who placed 12th in the inaugural race, repeatedly was caught
drafting behind cars and was disqualified. Three other riders, according to Tour his-
torians, were also disqualified for similar offenses.
Through the years, Tour cheating has been progressively creative. In 1911, rider
Paul Duboc suffered miserably and collapsed about 60 miles into a stage that
included the famous climb to the Tourmalet. It’s never been proven, but Duboc’s
problem has always been linked to poisoning via another competitor.
Riders taking their own drugs have been the race’s biggest problem. During the 1955
race, seven riders suspected of taking amphetamines collapsed. One of the race’s
darkest days occurred in 1967. British rider Tom Simpson collapsed while climbing
and struggling up the barren ascent of Mont Ventoux. Simpson was flown by heli-
copter off the mountain, but died late in the afternoon of the stage. Amphetamines
were discovered in the pocket of Simpson’s jersey, and his autopsy revealed alco-
hol was present in his bloodstream.
In 1978, Belgian rider Michael Pollentier was caught with a contraption and tubes
under his uniform that allowed him to produce fake, clean urine for drug tests fol-
lowing his apparent win in the stage to L’Alpe d’Huez. Pollentier, who had assumed
the race leader with his stage win, was striped of the yellow jersey and his earnings,
and he was disqualified from the race.
The Tour’s most infamous cheating case occurred in 1998. Willy Voet, the team
soigneur for the Festina team, was arrested three days prior to the race at the
French border crossing for smuggling drugs. As the race began, the aftermath of
Voet’s arrest hung over the event. Festina team officials were eventually questioned,
and the Festina team was expelled from the race. When police began to search
other teams’ hotel rooms, riders vocally protested, and then took more drastic
action. With nine stages left, the peloton staged a two-hour, mid-race protest by
stopping and sitting down on the course. Riders protested again several days later,
too. Numerous teams left the race in disgust and disgrace, and when the peloton
arrived in Paris on the final day only 96 of 189 starters finished the race.

Photo finishes and split seconds
Every rider in the same peloton receives the same finishing time,
recorded by the race’s timekeeper. A separate group of riders or an
individual rider is given a new time as he crosses the line. Riders
who finish outside the permitted time limits are also timed, and
the timekeeper continues his daily task for the finish line until the
broom wagon, the final official race vehicle, arrives.
Times recorded in Tour road stages are rounded down to the near-
est second and used in overall standings. In time trials, stages in
which several riders can finish within the same second, times are
recorded to the hundredths of a second.
A photo is taken as the lead rider or riders cross the finish line. The
image is required to identify stage winners in many sprint finish
stages. Particularly in flat stages, when a large group of riders furi-
ously sprints toward the finish, only a split-second image can deter-
mine the winner, who may be victorious by the width of a spoke.
During some photo-finish stages, a winner is easily determined. But
it’s not uncommon for Tour officials to consider a photo finish for
several minutes before announcing some stage winners (see Figure
5-2 for an example). Sprinting specialists have an uncanny knack
for knowing if they’ve won, even if the finish appears extremely
close. But cyclists aren’t always right. On more than one occasion,
a sprinter in a group finish has, at the last split nano-second, thrust
his hand into the air to acknowledge a win, only to discover, a few
minutes later, that he hasn’t won. 
Staying in the know
Riders in the Tour wearing earpieces communicate with their team
directors via two-way radios. Team directors tell riders what’s hap-
pening in the peloton or give instructions to a team leader, another
individual rider, or the team at large.
Radio communication between riders and their teams doesn’t
always work in mountains, and in some instances, riders don’t
listen or feign as if they can’t hear a race director’s instructions.
Starting orders and paying fines
No rider likes to be fined, but after every stage, the amounts of
fines (in Swiss Francs) for individuals and teams are listed in the
official results booklet. Riders’ fines are levied for a multitude of
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
74

infractions, from holding on to a team car too long to indiscreet
bathroom breaks. Teams are also fined for improper passing in the
race caravan and a host of other infractions with similar penalties.
Fines range from 30 Swiss Francs ($25) to several thousand Swiss
Francs and time penalties.
Figure 5-2: A photo finish from the 1998 Tour de France.
A lot of fines are levied because of marketing stunts. Mario Cipollini
was famous for this and had it written into his contract that his
sponsors pay for all his fines. One time, he showed up to the
Prologue wearing a full body suit printed like a human muscular
skeleton. Needless to say, this was not his team uniform, but he got
a lot of publicity (and so did his sponsors!).

Chapter 6
Understanding Race
Strategies
In This Chapter
 Understanding that planning is paramount for success
 Doing the right thing — protecting the race leader
 Moving the riders en masse
 Watering sunflowers along the route
U
nlike some sports, when the strongest athlete goes to the
front of the race and tries to stay there, the Tour de France is
three weeks of strategy and nuance. Riders use and conserve their
energies for appropriate moments — like when the hills are steep
and their muscles quickly begin to burn. In that respect, cycling is
ahead on the brains-o-meter when compared to some other sports.
This is where cycling’s team strategy comes in.
This chapter explains what’s really happening when you see a rider
take off alone, and then everyone calmly follows in a huge pack, or
when a rider drops way behind. You will know exactly why and what
they’re thinking and doing. We also tell you the answer to the univer-
sal question, “What happens when they gotta go to the bathroom?”
Here’s the Plan, Man!
One of the most often asked questions in the Tour de France is,
“If Lance Armstrong is the best rider in the Tour de France, why
doesn’t he just win every day?” The answer is simple. If Armstrong
or any other Tour de France champion tried to win every day, he
would fail. In this way, team strategy is more important than indi-
vidual race strategy. Although Tour de France strategy may seem
odd, that’s just the way the race works. The overall champion wins
because he uses his strength and his teammates’ strengths wisely.
As such, the Tour de France is unlike any other sport.

Winning is still a good thing in cycling, but the simple equation of
winning at all costs doesn’t fit for a cyclist trying to win the overall
title.
The Tour de France is like a chess game — that is, if the pawns,
rooks, knights, bishops, and the king all had wheels, shaved legs,
and wore Lycra/Spandex shorts. The riders, like chess pieces, all
have places and responsibilities as they roam around a game
board called France. And like chess, if they make a wrong move,
the game can quickly end.
Michael Jordan is often considered the finest player in basketball
history. But if he had no one around him to set screens, pass him
the ball, or help him defend the other team’s players, he would
have accumulated exactly zero NBA championships. The Tour
works the same way. Just as the Chicago Bulls had team plans
during Jordan’s six NBA titles, so, too, did Lance Armstrong’s
teams have race plans during his six Tour de France victories (at
least it was six when this book went to print).
Peloton is a French word that means group, and in Spanish it
means squad. The peloton is the entire group, or pack of racers
(see Figure 6-1), usually numbering around 200 cyclists (sometimes
a little more; sometimes less) each year in the Tour de France.
Teams don’t necessarily ride all together in the peloton, so you see
a kaleidoscope of different colored jerseys charging down the race
route. However, notice that the contender for the overall title usu-
ally has at least two, and maybe more, of his teammates riding pro-
tectively near him. The teammates’ job is to protect the contender
from crashes and from the wind and to lend a wheel or his own
bike if the contender has a mechanical problem.
Each rider in the peloton starts out with a specific job to fulfill that
has been assigned by the directeur sportif, also called just the direc-
tor, who is the team manager (see Chapter 4). Each job description
may also change as events or situations evolve throughout the race.
The peloton splinters into different groups during the stage; you
hear them called a chase group or pack. On French National
Television or on the Outdoor Life Network (OLN), you see icons for
Chase Group 1 and Chase Group 2, and also see the time differen-
tials shown between the groups and the leaders. During the diffi-
cult mountain stages, the peloton may be strung out, with groups
of stragglers as much as 45 minutes or more behind. The strag-
glers, called the gruppetto by the Italians and the autobus by the
French, risk being removed from the race under the official time-
limit rules (see Chapter 5). Sometimes, if an important contender
has a mechanical problem or if he crashes, teammates drop back
to help bring him quickly back to the peloton.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
78

Figure 6-1: The peloton charges down the Champs Élysées during the 2004 Tour
de France, led by the U.S. Postal Service Professional Cycling Team.
As you’re watching the Tour, you may hear the announcers refer to
the peloton as if it has a mind and life of its own. They may say that
the peloton doesn’t seem to be interested, or that the peloton has
finally decided to give chase. The peloton has certain acknowl-
edged leaders who command respect and cooperation from all the
riders. The strongest and most respected leader may be called The
Patron, which is French for owner or boss. This leader may have a
strong influence on where and when the peloton takes an action, or
if it does not respond. The peloton is an awesome and goose-bump-
inspiring sight to see 200 riders come thundering by you, at high
speeds, with mere inches between each other’s wheels.
Protecting the race leader
Drafting, which is illegal in some sports, is an integral part of cycling
strategy — and it doesn’t require pencils or paper. Cyclists use draft-
ing the same way a defensive driver stays behind an 18-wheel truck
in a rainstorm, or to put it into racing terms, the way NASCAR driv-
ers draft off each other. By drafting (riding behind or close to one or
more teammates), the team leader remains protected — and saves
up to 30 percent of his energy — until it’s time for him to strut his
stuff en route toward his goal of winning the Tour de France.
Nowhere in recent years has the power of drafting been more
apparent than with the U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team (now the
Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team). George Hincapie is the only
Chapter 6: Understanding Race Strategies 79

rider who has been a teammate of Lance Armstrong’s in all his
Tour de France titles. More times than not, during stages (see
Chapter 2), Hincapie has finished just ahead of Armstrong or just
behind him. In many instances, much of Hincapie’s job for a day
was to escort Armstrong through the flats and over rolling hills
and to provide a buffer for the champion when danger lurked. This
approach is the same with other teams. When working for a team
leader or in a group of riders from several teams, riders draft off
other riders to help them fight against the wind.
Chasing down the competition
Each team must determine how best to protect its leader. Likewise,
each squad and its team director also make an equally important
decision almost every day: If another team’s rider decides to pedal
for the glory on a particular day, the other teams have to decide
whether to let the rider pedal miles ahead of the field or respond
furiously and make a concerted effort to track him down.
Each team’s director monitors the race from a team car. If he makes
a decision to tell the team to ride after the leader of the day’s race,
the move can occur swiftly. The riders’ quick moves (see more in
the “Attacking and breakaways” section later in this chapter) occur
when a cyclist leading the day’s race has such a big margin that he’s
threatening to take over the race lead or has already done so.
The race leader’s teammates try valiantly, regardless of the situa-
tion, to keep him in the overall race lead. In doing so, each team
has to decide which of its riders on any given day (or every day)
sacrifice their individual performances, and use the synergy of
strength in numbers to quickly narrow a stage leader’s margin.
(See Chapter 3 for more information on stage leaders.)
Pulling and sacrificing
When a rider pulls, he takes the front spot of the group and sets
the pace. This move may actually increase the speed or provide
only a false speed for a short period. Taking a wheel means tucking
right behind another rider to gain the optimum draft, otherwise
known as sitting on.
Pulling is used most effectively in the mountain stages. Domestiques,
or helpers, are assigned to lead their top contender up the climb,
setting a fast pace to make it difficult for the other teams to follow.
These special domestiques are top-notch climbers themselves. They
allow the team leader to conserve his energy by following closely on
their wheel, drafting behind while they pull him along with their
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
80

combined energy. (And no, they aren’t allowed to physically push or
pull him in any way.)
No team ever wants to see its leader completely alone near the top
of a grueling climb, trying to fend off attacks and having no one to
protect him or pull him along. A distinct psychological advantage
occurs when the other riders in the peloton can see a team leader
flying up the mountain, being pulled along by two or three strong
climbers on his team. So, domestiques ride for their team leader
until they have no leg strength and no energy left: They completely
sacrifice themselves. Then another domestique takes over, or the
leader has to continue climbing solo. The sacrificial domestique,
completely spent, drifts to the back of the peloton and becomes
part of the gruppetto, trying to make the time cut.
Chapter 6: Understanding Race Strategies 81
Sacrificing for the leader
Several riders may be directed to go full speed in a stage to pull and sacrifice for
their leader. A good example in the 2004 Tour happened during Stage 13, from
Lannemezan to Plateau de Beille. Johan Bruyneel, the directeur sportif for the U.S.
Postal Service Cycling Team (now called the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team),
sent his entire team out in front right from the start. The U.S. Postal team set a tempo
that overwhelmed most other riders and they sacrificed themselves along the way,
and then dropped to the rear of the peloton with the gruppetto.
The stage was 217 kilometers (135 miles) long, finishing atop the daunting 18.5-kilo-
meter ascent to Plateau de Beille. This climb has a gradient of 6.4 percent. The stage
included five other climbs, making for a grueling day. The Col des Ares was just a
warm-up at 797 meters (about 1⁄2 mile) with a 3.4 percent gradient. Then, in succes-
sion, came the 1,069-meter (about 3⁄4-mile) Col du Portet d’Aspet, with a 10-kilome-
ter ascent and a 5.4 percent gradient, and then the 1,395-meter (nearly 1 mile) Col
de la Core, with a 14.5-kilometer climb at a 5.8 percent gradient. The Col de Latrape
was at the 139-kilometer (86-mile) mark in the race, presenting a long, grinding 18-
kilometer (11-mile) ascent with a 3.3 percent gradient, followed by the 9.5-kilome-
ter (nearly 6-mile) Col d’Agnes, with an 8.4 percent gradient.
Approaching the end, the front of the peloton had only about 30 racers, with five from
the U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team. Jose Azevedo, Jose Luis Rubiera, Floyd Landis,
and George Hincapie were pulling Lance Armstrong toward victory on the Plateau
de Beille at an unbelievable pace. Azevedo brought Armstrong up the challenging
ascent, while other top contenders, like Haimar Zubeldia, Tyler Hamilton, and Iban
Mayo, dropped off. Only Ivan Basso could keep pace with Armstrong’s group.
In the end, Armstrong gained his first stage win of the Tour. Thomas Voeckler
remained in the yellow jersey in the General Classification (see Chapter 3), but
Armstrong was on his way to his sixth Tour de France victory.

Attacking and breakaways
An attack is a rapid and often surprise acceleration by one of the
riders in the peloton. The timing of the attack is crucial, and experi-
enced riders have well-earned knowledge of the course, combined
with an uncanny intuition, to know just when to take off. In an
instant, the rider stands and accelerates, flashing by the leaders. If
his attack is successful, he may be victorious. But, most often, the
leading group chases him down (known as a counter-attack), or he
realizes that he cannot maintain the pace, and slows down to await
the inevitability of being swallowed up by the peloton.
The directeur sportif may send a rider out to attack on long, flat
stages to set a high pace and try to exhaust other riders. Riders
may attack in the mountains to try to wear out the leader and his
domestiques. Short, repeated bursts of attacks are also used to
challenge and test the overall contender, to test the peloton, or to
entice another rider to form an alliance and go for a stage win.
Different teams cooperate to constantly attack and exhaust the
overall contender in the mountain climbs.
A breakaway is usually a small group of riders (sometimes a solo
rider) taking off when the peloton is setting a relaxed pace along
the route. Breakaways frequently happen early in a flat stage and
usually do not contain any of the top contenders. A rider in a long
breakaway gets lots of valuable television exposure and makes
sponsors happy. Usually, the breakaway riders are low in the
General Classification (see Chapter 4), perhaps 10 to 25 minutes
back, and are not a threat. So the overall contender and his team,
as well as the peloton, make the decision to not use up any effort or
energy to chase a breakaway down. In the last kilometers of the
stage, the peloton reels in, or chases down, the breakaways, and
they drop back with the gruppetto. A breakaway rider is seldom vic-
torious in the stage, but it does happen.
Miles to Go Before I Sleep
The distance of each Tour de France stage is measured in kilome-
ters. All of the stages, added together, are known as the course route,
which is announced the October before each year’s event. The
Prologue or prerace can be as short as approximately 5 kilometers
(3.1 miles), while the event’s longest days can approach 250 kilome-
ters (155 miles). The longest stage of the 2004 race was the tenth
stage from Limoges to Saint-Flour at 237 kilometers (147 miles).
The severe climbs of the Alps and Pyrenees take their toll on
riders’ legs, but the cumulative effect of long stages does damage,
too. The 2005 Tour de France route included five stages of at least
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
82

200 kilometers (125 miles) long, including the longest of the race,
the 239-kilometer (148-mile) 17th stage from Pau to Revel.
While high-mileage stages are hardly something riders look for-
ward to, particularly in the race’s waning days, a long stage can be
a reprieve. A flat stage 50 percent longer than a mountain stage
with a half-dozen climbs can be considered refreshing — especially
for cyclists who have already ridden up steep terrain and negoti-
ated harrowing descents for days.
The day’s unique circumstances, the closeness of the overall title
and the subtitles, the cumulative strength of the teams’, and the
weather conditions dictate stage strategy. Tour de France riders
are accustomed to riding in strong winds, rain, and even snow. But
in some ways, how the peloton approaches and endures a seven-
hour ride across the French countryside is much the same as how
a motorist considers negotiating a seven-hour drive. Driving
through fields of sunflowers or vineyards on a clear, windless day,
for example, can define a pleasant French holiday. But covering the
same route in a rainstorm and into 60 mph winds isn’t particularly
appealing. The difference is that a motorist can make a choice. A
Tour de France cyclist can opt not to make the journey on a miser-
able day, too. But if he does so, his Tour de France participation
abruptly ends.
For the race leader and those seeking a top overall race finish, a
long, flat stage often requires a minimal show of superior individ-
ual skills. It requires plenty of attentive riding, too. Ideally, several
of each teams’ support riders ride close to their team leader.
Particularly on inclement weather days, the team leader can
greatly benefit from riding behind his teammates. In short, the
team riders are required to utilize vast amounts of energy to break
through the headwinds and negotiate troublesome crosswinds
(winds coming from the side).
Domestiques: Delivering
news and other stuff
A stage distance may be changed in severe weather or because of a
natural disaster. On rare occasions, mountaintop routes have been
shortened in blizzard-like conditions. Announced routes have also
been altered because of unexpected road construction, mudslides,
and other catastrophes.
Delivering messages from the directeur sportif
Most teams in the race have two-way radio communications
between riders and team directors, who follow their riders in team
Chapter 6: Understanding Race Strategies 83

vehicles. But technology sometimes fails. And if a team director
wants to tell his riders something, that leaves one surefire method.
If the team director can get the attention of one his riders, the
cyclist falls back and rides alongside of the team car while he’s get-
ting the instructions. This rider loses a good chunk of time, but the
messenger returns to the main group and delivers the good — or
bad — news. As such, that rider’s potentially strong individual day
could be easily nullified. That’s the nature of cycling strategy — a
team rider’s job is done well when he sacrifices his potential glory
for the good of the team.
Resupplying food and beverages
Each road stage of the Tour de France has designated areas for
team personnel to deliver food and liquids to the riders. It doesn’t
always go smoothly and rarely are the scheduled resupply areas
adequate, particularly on hot and long mountain stages.
In fact, team riders — and even team leaders on rare occasions —
have to work like pack mules during a stage. It can happen once or
several times during a stage. It likely may be the same rider who had
just fallen back to the team car for instructions who again is called
upon to fetch water bottles, fruit, and energy bars for his teammates.
It’s common practice for the rider who’s sent to the team car to
carry back as much as he can. He’ll stuff a half-dozen full water
bottles into the pockets in the back of his shirt. He’ll throw a few
musettes (small bags of food) over his head and stuff bananas into
the waistband of his cycling shorts. He’ll even carry another water
bottle in his mouth for a while if the route suddenly requires that
he have two hands on his handlebars.
Bringing in replacement wheels
The most annoying delay for cyclists is a flat tire, and there’s only
one sure thing about a flat tire in the Tour de France — there’s never
a good time to get one. Team cars have replacement wheels, and the
race provides a vehicle, called a neutral support vehicle, that can
replace any rider’s flat tire, regardless of his team affiliation.
Sometimes, it seems like a domestique’s day will never end. Even if
he has delivered water bottles and brought food to his teammates
throughout the day, if the team leader has a flat tire, the same
domestique stops and waits for the repair of the leader’s tire and
wheel. A domestique may even give his team leader his bike if the
problem is more serious than a flat tire. Giving someone else your
equipment is illegal in some sports, but giving up your bike to a
teammate is perfectly legal in the Tour de France. It’s not a strategy
that anyone looks forward to, but when it happens, it means a
team rider has done his job and done it well.
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
84

The peloton: Stuck in
the middle with you
Riding in the peloton with roughly 200 other racers requires skill,
alertness, assertiveness, and just plain old guts. The competitors
ride for hours with only a couple of inches between their wheels
and the wheels of other riders. In front, in back, and on each side
of them, a potential accident is waiting to happen — and frequently
does. One fleeting moment of inattention, and a rider is on the
ground. Swerving and braking unexpectedly, or someone having a
mechanical problem, can cause several riders to fall like dominoes
on wheels.
Chapter 6: Understanding Race Strategies 85
Pedaling into U.S. record books
Tyler Hamilton had ridden for two weeks with a fractured clavicle, but in Stage 16
of the 2003 Tour de France, he still felt like he had something to prove. After miss-
ing an early break on a misty and cool morning in the stage from Pau to Bayonne,
Hamilton joined the lead group of riders, and then timed his strategy perfectly to
become the sixth American in history to win a stage of the Tour. (With his stage win,
Hamilton joined Armstrong, Greg LeMond, Andy Hampsten, Davis Phinney, and Jeff
Pierce as the American winners of Tour de France stages.)
After riding for more than 113 kilometers (70 miles) with the lead group, Hamilton
powered off the front of the peloton and built more than a five-minute lead while
riding nearly 80 kilometers (50 miles) alone. His move occurred on the ascent to the
Col de Bagargui. The lead group of 17 riders dwindled to 10 when Hamilton made his
move.
Despite the collective strength of the riders in the chasing group, Hamilton main-
tained a four-minute margin as he neared the day’s final miles and with his victory
nearly secured. Considering his injury and his sudden move, Hamilton used the ele-
ment of surprise strategy perfectly and successfully.
Hamilton, from Marblehead, Massachusetts, said afterward that he wanted to thank
his teammates. “I wanted to pay back my teammates who had been there helping
me every day since the crash,” said Hamilton, who suffered a nondisplaced collar-
bone fracture in a crash near the finish of the first stage. “I’m exhausted; I gave
everything. I’m still not 100 percent, but to win a stage is fantastic.”
“To win a Tour stage is beyond my wildest dreams,” Hamilton continued. “I’ve been
a bit disappointed up to now, even though I was seventh overall, which I think is
respectable if you consider my injury, but without it, I know I could have been even
better. After my victory today, I can forget about all my grief.”

In the peloton, massive pileups occur in a flash. In a recent Tour,
a huge crash occurred because the riders in the middle of a pack
heard what they thought was someone braking in the front of the
peloton, and instantly grabbed their brakes. What they heard was
noise from a spectator. Still the panic response from the riders
caused a huge pileup of riders and bikes. Clavicle (collarbone),
shoulder, and wrist injuries are common, and the unfortunate rider
is often out of the Tour. At that point, the team has to ride the Tour
with the serious disadvantage of being one rider short. Less seri-
ous injuries, such as road rash, bloody elbows and knees, torn
shorts, and raw fingers, are common.
Experienced riders are very aware of who is riding next to them,
and they move away from reckless or inexperienced riders. Race
commentators often say that “the peloton is nervous” in the begin-
ning stages of the Tour. Constant chatter is ongoing in the peloton:
talking, shouting, and arguing. Hearing a rider swearing and shout-
ing at another rider to get away from him, and stay away, is com-
monplace in the peloton. Nobody wants to ride two inches away
from an erratic racer.
Elbowing and jostling for position is a normal part of being in the
peloton, as is giving someone the shoulder or the evil eye to intimi-
date them. On the other hand, cooperation and respect among
riders is an absolute must and is an unwritten rule of the peloton.
The strategy for most team leaders is to stay in front, safely ahead
of any crashes or screw-ups by other riders. On a rainy day, many
teams move their leaders to the front. The team leader rides, sur-
rounded by his domestiques. Lance Armstrong usually rides with
two or three of his teammates beside him, and he’s nearly always
toward the front when riding in the peloton.

86
The peloton was nervous
During the 2004 Tour de France, the peloton was nervous about riding over a narrow
cobblestone road in Stage 3 from Waterloo to Wasquehal. Even before the cobble-
stones in Wandignies, some of the riders panicked and began fighting to get to the
front. The inevitable crash occurred, and the peloton split, leaving top contenders
Iban Mayo and Haimar Zubeldia caught in the back. These unlucky riders lost more
than four minutes getting back to the front of the peloton, and lost all chances of a
top position in the General Classification. Their chance of winning the Tour de
France ended with the crash in that early stage.

The exception to this tactic is when a bunch sprint is coming up;
it’s one of the most dangerous times in the peloton. Sprinters are
traditionally the aggressive daredevils of the peloton. When the
sprinters take off, everybody gets out of their way — even team
leaders drop back and let sprinters fight it out. The team leaders
sometimes drop all the way back into a separate, small pack
behind the main peloton. Why then, would any rider stay in the
middle of the peloton? Energy conservation is the answer. Riding in
the peloton and being protected from the wind can save 30 percent
or more of a rider’s vital energy resources. This is energy saved for
grueling climbs or for being sent out in front to chase down a
breakaway. By riding in the peloton, riders save themselves for
demanding assignments or weather conditions that they have to
endure to finish the stage.
Heeding Nature’s Call 
While Riding
A peloton of 200 riders ride for hours on a bike in front of thou-
sands of fans. They’re drinking gallons of fluids from water bottles
to stay hydrated. They’re sweating and they’re . . . yes, this is the
common question, “Hey, what do they do when they gotta go?”
French attitude toward heeding nature’s call is different than many
Americans’ values. Along French roads, men commonly stand
beside their cars, casually urinating. And although it’s common-
place in Europe, Tour regulations don’t permit riders to openly uri-
nate in front of spectators. So, what’s a rider to do?
Frequently, several riders in the peloton make a decision to stop
along a less crowded stretch of road. They stop their bikes, put
a foot down, and do their thing. The rest of the peloton has an
unwritten, absolute obligation to not attack while these riders are
watering the sunflowers. They mellow out and wait for the others
to resume their places in the peloton.
Sometimes, racers ride three or four abreast, each with an arm on
the shoulder of the rider next to him. This is not a spontaneous
gesture of camaraderie: They’re bracing and balancing the rider on
the inside while he urinates. That rider discretely adjusts the leg of
his shorts to accommodate the process.
Whether in a small group or solo, the rider has to be cognizant of
where the riders are when he urinates on the move. He gets a great
deal of grief from the other riders if there’s any overspray. In short,
he has to make sure nobody is downwind.
Chapter 6: Understanding Race Strategies 87

What happens if a rider needs a more serious bathroom break? He
has to head out into the bushes just like Tour spectators. The pelo-
ton usually slows down and waits for him to finish, because they all
know they may be the one who needs to stop next time.
The unwritten rule for press photographers used to be that cameras
were turned away from riders heeding nature’s call. In recent times,
shots of riders standing along the roadside are pretty common, and
often pretty funny. No close-ups, of course!
Part II: How the Race Is Run and Won 
88
Breaking the rules
The unwritten rule to not attack during a bathroom break was violated during Stage
6 of the 2000 Tour. Laurent Jalabert was wearing the yellow jersey and stopped
along the road soon after the depart in Vitre. Jacky Durand attacked and took sev-
eral riders with him and the group, ending up more than seven minutes in front.
While Durand said he hadn’t known that Jalabert stopped, the race leader lost the
yellow jersey and was furious.

R
acing at the highest professional level begins each year in
January, so that, by the time riders begin the Tour de France,
they’ve finely tuned their bodies for several months. Every Tour
team has a season itinerary that includes numerous one-day races,
shorter-duration stage races lasting as long as ten days, and three-
week stage races called Grand Tours. Many of these European
events are longstanding traditional competitions and are now part
of the newly created ProTour.
Racing is highly competitive, and victories and top performances
are well rewarded. Cyclists also know their results in these events
may lead to selection to their team’s Tour de France squad. Teams
selected to participate in the Tour have a couple dozen riders on
their respective rosters, yet only nine riders compete for each
Tour team. Competition among most riders is fierce for only a few
available roster spots. Teams usually begin to announce their Tour
rosters in the days following conclusion of the Giro d’Italia (Tour of
Italy) in late May or in early June. In some instances, teams’ final
roster spots aren’t announced until a few days prior to the Tour.
Racing hard through the spring, potential Tour riders have a plan:
Get into prime shape, stay healthy, avoid injury, and arrive at the
starting line for the first Tour stage at the peak of condition — if
they’re selected. It’s easier said than done. This chapter shows you
how the nine riders who make each Tour team push their bodies to

endurance extremes. They’re training and competing hard while
avoiding a wide variety of potential disasters waiting around every
bend in the road.
Two Hundred Cyclists: Maintaining
Their Bodies
To prepare for the season and maintain peak efficiency, Tour cyclists
lead a finely monitored, balanced life. Proper training, nutrition, rest,
massage, and general good health are all intertwined components of
their competitive careers.
Nutrition and proper rest are paramount in most sports. And
because cyclists use their legs like pistons day in and day out,
their leg muscles (and the rest of their bodies) are regularly mas-
saged. Manipulation of cyclists’ muscles greatly enhances recovery
from training and racing that can last seven hours per day — and
for three weeks at a time.
Shaving legs and getting road rash
Like their counterparts in swimming and triathlons, cyclists shave
their legs. It’s part tradition, part comfort, and part medical neces-
sity. It’s why Tour riders shave their legs as part of the cycling
lifestyle, not only for the Tour’s three weeks. Some riders believe
there’s an aerodynamic benefit to riding hairless, but various tests
in controlled wind-tunnel environments discount the theory. More
relevant are the benefits of massage on hairless skin, and the ease
of cleaning and treating wounds.
Hair can be an irritant during massage, and cyclists like the benefits
of a smooth massage, not the potential scraping of their body hair.
Also, without hair on their legs, cyclists who crash and suffer skin
abrasions, commonly known as road rash, are fortunate. Abrasions
and other skin problems (see typical bandages in Figure 7-1) are
easier to manage when there’s no hair in the way.
You are what you eat
Beyond intense racing, Tour cyclists face another difficult test on
and off their bikes: eating enough food. Tour cyclists may consume
up to 7,000 calories per day while on the Tour; they eat much less
when competing in other races or not competing at all. 
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
92

Figure 7-1: Bandages are a common sight on riders at the Tour.
Tour teams eat breakfast and dinner together at their respective
hotels. A third pre-race team meal is part of the nutrition equation,
if time permits, on late-starting stage days or on rest days. Riders
also eat huge amounts of food during stages. Turkey and ham
sandwiches, rice cakes, fruit, energy bars, and energy gels are stan-
dard fare. Tour cyclists may consume 400 calories — sometimes
more — for each hour on their bikes.
Team soigneurs (masseurs and support staff) and chefs prepare
riders’ daily racing food. It’s distributed by team personnel in
musettes (small bags of food) in designated stage areas called feed-
ing zones. Teams’ domestiques (team riders) also make many trips
back to team cars during road stages to resupply their teammates
with snacks.
During the Tour, riders generally divide their food intake into three
main groups: carbohydrates (70 percent), protein (15 percent), and
fat (15 percent). During sit-down meals prepared by team chefs,
popular carbohydrate sources include potatoes, rice, pasta, cereal,
whole grain breads, fruits, and vegetables. Eggs, chicken, fish,
some red meat, and yogurt are popular proteins. Butter, cheese,
and carefully chosen cooking oils (olive oil) are regular fat sources.
Chapter 7: Who Are These Guys and How Do They Do It? 93

When Tour riders eat is also important. Riders eat a breakfast
that’s heavy on carbohydrates, and they try to finish their meals
about three hours prior to racing. Riders are handed chock-full
musettes during and shortly after stages are over, plus recovery
fluids. Team dinners, which have about the same number of calo-
ries as breakfast and are also heavy on carbs, are consumed just
before riders retire to their rooms for the night.
Hydrating — or else
Tour cyclists need massive amounts of liquids to maintain proper
body fluid levels. Riders usually carry two 20-ounce water bottles
on their bikes during road stages. As temperatures increase and
sometimes exceed 100 degrees, dehydration is an acute possibility.
Riders drink two bottles of water every hour during the Tour, and
in extreme heat, cyclists can drink three bottles (or nearly two
quarts) of fluid per hour — that’s as much as three gallons during
a long stage.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
94
Tour 2003: It was a very hot year
The 100th anniversary of the Tour in 2003 is often cited as among the greatest edi-
tions in race history. Lance Armstrong rode to his tightest margin of victory in the
Tour’s fastest-ever race. Nearly every stage included dramatic moments — crashes,
surprising attacks, unique developments in the peloton (the pack of riders), and sur-
prises in varied jersey competitions (see Chapter 3).
The 2003 Tour was also among the hottest in history. Temperatures reached into the
high 90s (°F), and the heat took its toll in several ways. Numerous riders suffering from
dehydration withdrew. Cyclists are not inclined to take water from fans because it
could be contaminated, but the 2003 Tour was an exception. Riders often accepted
water from spectators and used it to douse themselves in the scorching heat.
Extreme temperatures also could have easily foiled Armstrong’s bid for his fifth con-
secutive title. Armstrong suffered from dehydration during the exceedingly hot and
humid Stage 12 individual time trial stage from Gaillac to Cap Decouverte. Favored to
win, Armstrong faltered in the second half of the 47-kilometer (29.2-mile) course and
placed second, 1 minute and 36 seconds behind Germany’s Jan Ullrich. Armstrong
finished with large amounts of dried salt on his mouth and ended the day with only a
precarious 15-second overall race lead over Ullrich, the 1997 race winner.
Because of dehydration, Armstrong’s weight dropped from 72.5 kilograms (159.5
pounds) to 66.5 kilograms (146.3 pounds) during the 12th stage. But the next day,
Armstrong was among favorites again in the 197.5 kilometer route from Toulouse to
Plateau de Bonascre. The stage finished with two Category 1 climbs (see Chap-
ter 3); Armstrong placed fourth and said it was impossible to recover fully from the
effects of the previous day’s bout of dehydration.

While consuming mass amounts of fluids, cyclists need to maintain
proper levels of sodium, potassium, and calcium to coordinate
bodily functions. Because Tour riders sweat profusely, their replen-
ishment fluids include drinks with high electrolyte levels. In fact, it’s
common to see riders during and after stages with dried salt on
their helmets, jerseys, shorts, and body parts. Keeping teammates
supplied with enough fluid is among the primary jobs of domes-
tiques. But on warm Tour days, domestiques can’t always get enough
water to teammates, and lack of proper hydration causes a share of
riders to abandon the race.
Cyclists must also be aware not to drink too much water. If they
don’t balance the equation of fluids and electrolytes properly, a
rare but serious condition called hyponatremia, or water intoxica-
tion, occurs. Hyponatremia is the result of a severe dilution of the
body’s electrolytes. An athlete suffering from severe hyponatremia
can lapse into a coma or even die.
What’s Up, Doc?
Tour teams have physicians and other staff medical personnel who
travel with the cyclists throughout the season. Because cyclists
compete at the highest fitness level and put their bodies through
incredible physical stress, their immune systems are susceptible
and illness is common during the Tour. From bee stings to food
poisoning, broken bones to saddle sores, team physicians meet
cyclists’ daily needs. In addition to team physicians, the Tour has
staff physicians who monitor the race and who examine each Tour
entrant prior to the race.
While it’s part formality, every Tour rider undergoes an examina-
tion that includes weight, lung capacity, heartbeat, and verbal
assessment tests. Heart rate and weight totals are documented in
riders’ profiles and conducted to detect any irregularities. Lung
capacity evaluations are used to determine respiratory problems.
Physicians also question athletes about any existing injuries or 
illnesses.
Team and Tour physicians do their best to keep riders racing.
From broken bones to stomach viruses, physicians work long
hours before, during, and after stages to keep riders healthy or
mend them when they’re not. It’s not uncommon to see a team
physician leaning out of a team car helping a rider during a stage.
One of the only times a rider can hold onto a moving support vehi-
cle during the Tour, without penalty, is when he is ill or injured.
Chapter 7: Who Are These Guys and How Do They Do It? 95

Despite eating and drinking well and astute physicians’ care, com-
peting while sick is common at the Tour. Colds, flu, infections, and
broken bones stop many cyclists’ race participations. But many
cyclists persevere with varying illnesses. Finishing the Tour is tan-
tamount to success for many riders, and riding through various 
illnesses is a daily occurrence, if the team physician allows. Any
rider with an infection that could spread to another team member
is quickly quarantined.
Things That Go Bump in the Day
Tour crashes are unpredictable and dramatic, and they vary greatly.
It’s rare if a stage is held without at least one rider taking a minor
spill. At times, a large group of riders may fall in a chain reaction
and escape unhurt. Or one rider can crash by himself and suffer
fatal injuries.
Crashes occur for many reasons. Tour riders often compete
together while riding on thin tires, on varying road surfaces, and
at speeds that can approach 97 kph (60 mph) during mountain
descents. A pebble, twig, or a pothole; a slight mistake by a rider in
a massive pack; or a momentary lapse of reason can bring down
the entire peloton.
Crashes in furiously fast finish line sprints are the most common.
If the peloton is together, it often approaches the line while pedal-
ing around 73 kph (45 mph). If riders’ wheels touch or cyclists 
otherwise bump, the entire field can fall, en masse, in a few sec-
onds. What happens in a massive crash depends on how and
where riders fall. The first riders down are likely to suffer more
serious injuries, because they hit the ground harder and are sus-
ceptible to other riders and bicycles piling on top of them. Cyclists
who fall later in the domino effect of crashes are often more fortu-
nate because they fall on other riders, not directly on asphalt. But
cyclists who fall later in crashes can also be hurt by other riders’
bicycles.
Riders must finish a stage within a designated time of the stage
winner to participate the next day, so riders who can continue
to race, even with minor injuries, return to their bikes and do
so. Riders who have suffered some type of injury, particularly
in major pileups, get in communication with team directors to
assess damage to themselves and their bikes and decide whether
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
96

to proceed. If a team leader or key team member has been hurt,
team members and directors may need miles to reassess team
strategy. Of course, cyclists suffering serious injuries who are
unable to continue are transported via ambulance to a local hospi-
tal or abandon the race in team vehicles or in the broom wagon
(see Chapter 3 for more on the broom wagon).
Singing in the rain
Rain is a Tour de France curse. Riders are accustomed to wearing
special jackets and pedaling for hours in inclement weather. But
they never get used to slick roads and the dangerous ways of 
pedaling in shower storms, particularly while descending slick
roads.
Just as drivers are warned of especially slippery roads, so, too, do
Tour riders face the dangers of wet asphalt. On sharp corners and
on steep descents, riders rely on superior bike-handling skills —
and luck — to avoid catastrophe in wet conditions.
It’s not always possible. Riders’ brakes get wet and their bikes’ thin
tires can’t get proper traction. Turning slightly too sharply on a
descent or descending (see Figure 7-2) too quickly off a mountain
can equate to potential disaster. Riders’ support staffs can, how-
ever, make adjustments for slick roads — for example, change to
tires that have a little more tread for traction or decrease tire pres-
sure to give more surface/road contact.
Chapter 7: Who Are These Guys and How Do They Do It? 97
The 1K rule
Several major crashes at the end of road races in recent years prompted Union
Cycliste Internationale (International Cycling Union) to reexamine what’s commonly
known as the 1K rule. Here’s what the rule says: If a problem occurs within the final
kilometer (0.62 miles) of a stage, riders who are involved in a crash, suffering a
mechanical problem, or dealing with a tire puncture are given the same finish time
as the rider(s) he was “in the company of.”
As of Jan. 1, 2005, the distance of the rule was extended to 3 kilometers (1.8 miles).
The change was made so that riders not seeking to contest sprints don’t have to
worry about losing finishing time and are, therefore, at less risk of crashing.

Figure 7-2: Profile of ascents in Stage 16 of the 2005 Tour from Mourenx to Pau.
Dealing with mechanical failures
Tour cyclists use the finest equipment, and Tour teams employ the
sport’s finest mechanics. But faulty gears, bad brakes, punctured
tires, and bent rims are common in the Tour, and riders are at the
mercy of mechanics’ quick fixes and equipment changes.
When a rider notices a problem with his bike, he raises his hand or
communicates via radio to his team. The Tour also provides
mechanical support available to all teams. (More in Chapter 4.)

In some instances, if a team leader’s bike needs repair and the
team mechanics or Tour mechanical support isn’t nearby, a team-
mate gives up his bike — or a part of a bike, like a wheel — to the
leader, so that the leader doesn’t lose substantial time. (Of course,
the riders have to be nearly the same size for this type of bike
exchange to work.) The team rider then waits for repairs of
another new bike. He usually loses substantial time, but that’s the
nature of cycling as a team sport.
Chapter 7: Who Are These Guys and How Do They Do It? 99
Tour tragedies: Death on the mountain
Fabio Casartelli of Italy was an accomplished young professional riding as a
Motorola teammate of Lance Armstrong during the 1995 Tour de France. But on July
18 in the 15th stage, Casartelli suffered fatal injuries after crashing on the Col de
Portet d’Aspet in the Pyrenees. Casartelli, the 1992 Olympic road race champion,
crashed with several other riders on the descent and suffered severe facial and
head injuries. He was traveling at more than 85 kph (53 mph).
Casartelli’s death was the third Tour death in competition and the first since 1967.
Three days after his teammate perished, Armstrong won the 18th stage to Limoges.
As he crossed the line, Armstrong pointed his hands toward the sky to acknowl-
edge and honor his fallen teammate. The Tour revisited Col de Portet d’Aspet in 1997
and stopped momentarily at the spot where a monument honors Casartelli. Future
Tours will likely do the same.
Death first struck the Tour in 1935 when Spanish rider Francesco Cepeda suffered
fatal injuries after plunging down a ravine on the Col du Galibier. British rider Tom
Simpson collapsed and died on the climb of Mount Ventoux in the 1967 Tour.
Amphetamines and alcohol were discovered in Simpson’s bloodstream during his
autopsy. Like Casartelli, a monument near the climb’s summit honors Simpson, and
the Tour has paid its respects on several stage occasions.
The first Tour rider’s death occurred in 1910, but Adolph Helière of France didn’t die
in competition — he went for an ocean swim on a rest day and drowned. Several
noncyclists have also perished at the Tour. Radio reporter Alex Virot and Rene
Wagner, his motorcycle driver, were killed in 1957 after falling into a ravine during
the Barcelona to Ax-les-Thermes stage. And in more recent years, spectators have
died after being hit by race caravan vehicles.

W
atching the Tour de France on television, you see riders
and their entourage (support staffs) arrive, and you see
riders lining up at the start. As a spectator, you view bits and
pieces of the race, and then you see the finish, complete with fan-
fare and awards on the podium.
But what about the rest of the day? What do these riders do in their
spare time? Wait a minute — do they even have any spare time? A
typical day for a Tour de France rider is filled with back-to-back
scheduling: Rest is vital but elusive, and even time to rest has to be
scheduled into a jam-packed day.
Morning, Noon, and Night
Teams at the Tour de France have similar daily routines and sched-
ules. The lodging for all teams is scheduled by the Tour de France
organization, so teams don’t have any choice about where they
stay. Team lodging may be scattered all over an area near the start
or finish lines, so teams may have a drive of an hour or more to get
to the race start or to get back to their hotels from the finish line.
Usually, three or more teams stay at the same hotel.

Wherever they are, the riders are expected to participate as a team
unit for their scheduled meals, training rides, and meetings with
the public or press. Riders are rarely seen wandering around sight-
seeing or shopping solo, unless it’s a rest day. Riders at the Tour
de France have very little free time.
The Tour de France organization reserves 1,200 rooms every day
to provide lodging for the teams and their staff, the press, and Tour
personnel.
Rise and shine
Riders share a room with a teammate, and they all hope it’s a com-
patible match. Riders are awakened each day by their soigneurs
(masseurs and general support staff), and while riders may groan
about the early hour, they know they have to be at the breakfast
table on time. They shower, shave, and jump into their team sweat
suits and hurry to the team breakfast table. Riders are often in a
good mood in the morning (some may even joke around or play
pranks on each other), and are psyching themselves up for the
long racing day.
Team managers try to set up a separate dining room for the team, if
the hotel is large enough. The staff also tries to set up large tables
so six, eight, or more teammates can sit together.
Breakfast of champions
Healthy, adequate nutrition is an absolute top requirement to
maintain the endurance and stamina required to finish the Tour
de France. By the time a rider gets to this level of competition, he
eats what works best for his body chemistry.
Some people think a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon, pancakes, and
syrup is what riders want for breakfast, but that’s not the case. In
fact, when European teams come to America to race and see what
is offered for breakfast, they often buy their own breakfast foods to
bring to the team dining room. Preferred breakfast choices include
cereals, muesli, pasta, rice, bread rolls, eggs, yogurt, fruit, milk,
juices, bottled water, jam, and honey. Sometimes, chicken is offered,
too, along with olive oil for pasta.
Riders may drink coffee, but in moderate amounts because coffee
can be dehydrating. Caffeine is not a banned substance at the Tour
unless the caffeine concentration in the urine exceeds a certain
amount.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
102

Mini-meetings in the morning
All teams have a meeting in the morning before the start of the
Tour stage. For some teams, the meeting happens at the breakfast
table, if breakfast is served in a private dining room. Other times,
riders meet in a hotel room or on the team bus on the way to the
start line. Pep talks, team strategy, and specific assignments for the
day’s stage are presented by the directeurs sportif.
Cleaning and packing up
After breakfast, on race days, the riders return to their rooms
and quickly gather their racing kits and necessities for the day. In
most cases, rooms look like disaster areas — tidiness is not a part
of the plan.
The soigneurs usually have a day bag packed with each rider’s gear
to take on the bus. The soigneurs are responsible for packing up
all the riders’ belongings and loading it in the bus or team cars.
While the riders are limited to small bags of team-issue clothing,
the amount of team luggage transported by team personnel is
amazing.
European hotels seldom have parking lots at the door, so drivers
must double-park on the street and unload the luggage on the side-
walk. Curious crowds and autograph seekers often gather at team
hotels.
Moving On Down the Road
When many of the teams leave the hotel for the start of a Tour
stage, they travel in a luxurious team bus. These buses are com-
plete with a shower, bathroom, kitchen, and washers and dryers.
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 103
Loving those boxes of cereal
Several European teams come to the United States to race the USPRO
Championships in Philadelphia, and they all take their meals in the hotel dining room.
During the 2003 race, one morning at the team breakfast, the hotel staff stood in
awe as they watched a 125-pound, climbing specialist eat nine individual serving
size boxes of cereal with milk, plus yogurt and fruit.

Television(s), espresso machines, air conditioning, and GPS are
standard fixtures. Snacks, coffee, juices, and water are also plenti-
ful, so the team rides in luxury while they talk or plan strategies.
The bus is followed by the team cars and a team equipment truck.
(Note that some of these vehicles leave early, ahead of the bus, to
scout out the route and stake their claim to a spot in the team
parking area.)
Getting to the start of the stage on time is always a challenge. Team
vehicles fight their way through thousands of cars — traffic jams
are notoriously horrendous before the race. While the teams always
leave appropriately early, they sometimes need a police escort with
sirens and flashing lights to get them through the traffic jams.
As the team vehicles reach the Depart area, the crowds on foot and
bicycles present another challenge. The drivers must inch their
huge buses through swarms of fans with cameras and try to not run
over fervent autograph seekers. (If you go to the Tour, be careful in
these areas! Read more on attending the Tour in Chapter 11.) The
bus finally reaches the designated team parking area, where there
are barricades to keep out the crowds. However, sponsors, guests,
and the press are allowed inside this area, so there’s a large crowd.
Get Ready, Get Set, Go!
Try to imagine the scene: a chaotic mass of fans and media mem-
bers pushing against the yellow tape or barricades and waving
cameras or items for the riders to autograph. The riders come out
to warm up on their bikes, trying to concentrate, while cameras
flash and people yell their names, begging for an autograph. Still,
the riders have plenty to do before the race begins. This section
shares the details of the final pre-race preparation.
Fine-tuning the bikes
Bikes are lined up precisely in a row beside the team bus. At this
point, mechanics (also called wrenches — see Chapter 4) have
been setting up and fine-tuning the bikes since the team truck or
bus arrived. The bikes are shiny clean, and every part, every set-
ting, is precisely measured and adjusted.
The riders do, however, request last-minute adjustments on their
bikes (see Figure 8-1) and their shoes as they are leaving for the
start line. Some riders, such as Lance Armstrong, are known for
their perfectionism about their equipment — the equipment has to
be perfectly and precisely the right measurement.

the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team), fine-tunes Viatcheslav Ekimov’s bike.
Warming up
Riders warm up in their team’s barricaded area before the start of
each stage. Bikes are placed on stationary trainers (see Figure 8-2),
where the back wheel rides on rollers and the front wheel is on the
ground. Before time trial stages, riders work hard in their warm-
ups, sweating profusely, feet flying on the pedals. For other stages,
they’re just trying to loosen up.
Last-minute instructions
The directeur sportif and his assistants watch the riders warm up
and assess how the riders are feeling. The directors may also give
riders individual instructions while they’re on the warm-up bikes.
When the entire team is back in the bus, the directeur sportif again
reinforces the game plan and each rider’s job for the day. He gives
last-minute instructions to the team and/or to individual riders.
The riders hydrate, eat energy gel (like jelly, only a little more
solid), and may make a final trip to the bathroom. Because of the
importance of lining up at the start with the race number, soigneurs
make sure riders have their numbers on and are in the right place.
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 105

Signing in
Each rider is required to go individually to the signature registration
area or sign-in area near the start line (see Chapter 5 for additional
details). He must be there in person to sign his name on the start
list. A signing-in ceremony is held, where the race leaders are
announced, applauded, and celebrated.
The riders then return to the team bus to await the start time. It
is another hectic, chaotic trip to and from the sign-in area for the
riders. They ride their bikes through massive crowds, barely able
to squeeze through the jam-packed people. Pencils, pens, scraps of
paper, books, cameras — sometimes even babies — are thrust into
their faces. Small children may be pushed out in front of riders, in
the hopes that they won’t say no to an autograph request from a
child.
Lining up
A few minutes before the official start time, the riders make their
way from the bus back through the crowds and start lining up. The
race leaders and other well-known riders are placed at the front,
and riders from each team generally group loosely together in the
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
106

lineup. The credentialed press photographers, who wear identify-
ing vests, are allowed out on course for a short time to take their
photographs.
The Tour is filled with colorful ceremonies and pageantry at both
the start and finish of a stage. Local dignitaries and Tour officials
speak briefly before the stage begins.
Starting the Race
When the start gun sounds, the official cars and dozens of the
elite French Republican Guard on motorcycles move out, followed
by the 200 riders. Behind them are more official cars, police motor-
cycles, the 200-plus team cars, followed by numerous press vehi-
cles and emergency vehicles. The race cavalcade has hundreds
of vehicles.
Lunch for the Bunch
During Tour stages, lunch is handed to the racers as they ride
through a designated area called the feed zone, or zone de ravi-
taillement. Food is packed in cloth bags, called musettes, each of
which has a long, thin shoulder strap, like a purse.
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 107
Keeping the teams safe every day
The Tour de France is organized by the Amaury Sport Organization, or ASO, under
the direction of Jean Marie LeBlanc. A major challenge for the organizers is pro-
viding for day-to-day safety and security for each rider. Each day in a rider’s life at
the Tour, he depends on the ASO security arrangements to keep him safe while he
is giving his utmost for his team. The stage each day is fraught with potential minor
and major dangers.
Who protects the rider every day? During the three-weeks of the Tour, the ASO has
13,000 gendarmes (French police), 45 Guardes Républicaines (the snazzy-looking
gendarmes in tall black boots on the motorcycles), 9,000 police staff and CRS (com-
panies for Republican security — units of the national police), hundreds of sapeurs-
pompiers (national volunteer emergency and fire personnel), 3,000 government
officials, and dozens of well-trained Tour security guards.
Each rider knows that, every day, their safety depends on these well-trained secu-
rity forces.

The team soigneurs stand beside the road holding the musettes at
arm’s length. The riders slow their speed to each grab a musette.
The riders put the musettes around their necks while they transfer
lunch to the back pockets of their jerseys.
Riders receive small packets of high carb, easily digested items,
like little sandwiches filled with honey and banana slices, sweet
cakes, pastries, energy bars, energy gels, and water or a sports
drink. They discard the empty musettes along the side of the road
(see Figure 8-3), sending the fans into a grabbing frenzy. The
musettes and water bottles (called bidons) are highly sought after
by the fans lining the road along the feed zones.
Figure 8-3: This musette was tossed onto the mirror by Lance Armstrong as he
rode by, enroute to Saint-Dizier.
It Ain’t Over ’Til It’s Over
By the time a stage of the Tour de France is finished, the teams
have been riding for as long as six hours of intense concentration,
always on the alert to avoid crashing. Riders are constantly chas-
ing, pulling, or protecting their team leader. But crossing the finish
line doesn’t mean the day is over for the riders. There are hours
and miles to go before they can rest. They are only halfway to
slumberland.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
108

Soigneurs waiting at the finish line
Teams have their soigneurs standing just past the finish line, wait-
ing with towels, drinks, and jackets. The riders are exhausted,
sweaty, and depleted, some of them just barely hanging on. In fact,
sometimes, a soigneur has to literally hold up a rider to keep him
from falling and help him climb off his bike because his legs have
no strength left (see Figure 8-4).
Figure 8-4: The soigneur’s job starts at the finish line. Head Masseur Freddy
Viaene runs protectively with Jose Azevedo after the Stage 16 finish on L’Alpe
d’Huez.
Winners at the finish are required to go directly to the medical area
for drug testing, and then give interviews in the press area. Both of
these areas are barricaded off from the public and are zealously
guarded by Tour security forces. The area behind the podium is
also barricaded off, and only a few people are allowed to enter.
Most of the press is prevented from entering, causing tensions to
elevate. The big television companies are allowed to enter, along
with a few select photographers.
The victorious riders are delayed for nearly an hour from getting to
their team bus to clean up and replenish their bodies. As fatigued
and drained as these riders are, they must fulfill Tour requirements.
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 109

Getting crushed by the cameras
For many of the riders, crossing the finish line means getting
crushed by the media. Hordes of press, carrying cameras and
microphones, descend upon them (see Figure 8-5). Pushing and
shoving and jostling for position, the press is relentless in getting
the story.
Figure 8-5: The media swarms the riders as they finish at L’Alpe d’Huez in Stage
16 of the 2004 Tour de France.
Media coverage of the Tour is awesome: More than 2,300 accred-
ited journalists, plus 1,200 photographers, camera operators, and
TV directors follow the Tour each summer. In addition, according
to the Tour organization, an entourage of 1,100 technicians or driv-
ers, and more than 500 other journalists are given credentials.
Surviving the crowd: 
Getting to the bus
A long stretch of the road after the finish line is barricaded to pre-
vent the crowds from rushing out on the course. Riders may finish
30 minutes or more after the winners cross the line. For safety rea-
sons, fans are prevented from swarming out onto the arrivé, or
finish line area.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
110

A favorite spot for fans to gather is right past the final barricade on
the road. Riders slowly make their way through a shoulder-width
path on the way to the team bus. Race leaders usually have a staff
person to run road-blocking for them, but the rest of the riders
struggle their way through the crowd. It’s not unusual to see riders
with pen marks on their jerseys from people grabbing them, pen in
hand, trying to get a signature.
The crowd estimate for the 2004 Tour de France was 15 million
spectators from more than 22 countries. The ASO estimates 76 per-
cent of French residents have attended the Tour at least once.
Replenishing the calories
The first thing riders do when they enter the team bus is begin
restoring their energy balance. Their depleted bodies must be
cared for immediately. Carbohydrates are metabolized quickly,
so high-carb snacks are available. Energy drinks restore the elec-
trolyte balance, so riders hydrate their bodies. Each team has its
own kind of easily-digested sandwiches.
Traveling to the Next Hotel
Each team bus pulls out immediately after the last rider boards. It
may be a long drive to the night’s lodging, but even if the distance
is short, race traffic is usually bumper-to-bumper for miles. Bus
drivers are experts in this kind of traffic, but thousands of other
vehicles leave the finish area at the same time, and many of those
drivers aren’t experts.
While their bus is heading out, riders are eating and cleaning up —
getting out of their dirty, sweaty clothes. Keep in mind that staying
in their sweaty Lycra/Spandex shorts can cause sores that can be a
problem to heal. Team physicians immediately treat any injuries,
including road rash, sore muscles, cuts, and any other tender areas.
No Fun-Filled Evenings 
for the Riders
When the team bus arrives at the hotel, riders go to their rooms
and settle in. Showering and organizing their gear comes first, and
then the nightly routine begins. Nobody talks about a night on the
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 111

town, partying, or hanging out at a local pub. Instead, the Tour is
serious business and all forms of recreation are on hold till the last
night of the Tour, when some serious partying goes on all night
long.
Getting a rub: Massage is a must
Most teams have two or three soigneurs who give massages. A mas-
sage is an absolute must for tired, sore, and/or injured muscles.
Skilled massage therapists are a god-send for aching legs, arms,
and backs. The soigneurs know each rider’s body and are skilled at
working out the areas of stress and injury. Because even a small
injury or sore spot can become a major problem, a well-maintained
body is the best injury prevention.
A little nap time
After the massage, riders head to their rooms for a well-earned
nap. The old saying that the Tour is “won in bed” may bring a sly
grin, but what they are talking about is rest. Rest is a vital ingredi-
ent for a winning team, or for just being able to finish the Tour at
all. One team’s directeur sportif is so adamant about resting that he
wants his team to be horizontal when they are not riding!
Dining together
A team always sits together at dinner, which is usually served about
8 o’clock at night, depending on when the riders are finished racing.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
112
Burning calories
The adage that an army lives on its stomach is true for Tour de France teams. There’s
nothing more vital than adequate nutrition and hydration for each rider. Staying in
top performance shape to endure and finish a Tour means consuming an enormous
amount of calories on an almost constant basis. Most riders burn about 4,000 to
6,000 calories on flat stages and up to 8,000 calories on grueling mountain stages.
In spite of this level of calorie consumption, riders lose as much as eight pounds by
the time they cross the finish line on the Champs Élysées in Paris. During the last
mountain stages, the soigneurs sometimes find it difficult to give massages to the
depleted riders. Body fat and some muscle are almost impossible to maintain with
the enormous energy and power output of the riders.

Meals are prepared by the hotel chef and staff, which can make the
team and staff somewhat nervous. No, it’s not because they worry
that the riders won’t like the menu — it’s the possibility of eating
tainted food. Food preparation at little-known hotels leaves riders
at risk for food poisoning, which can take a horrendous toll on
racers in the Tour. Food preparation is one of the variables that the
team management can’t completely control, so they can only hope
that the food has been prepared under sanitary conditions and has
been properly refrigerated.
All teams eat a certain meat on a certain day; for example, every-
one may have chicken on Tuesday. How it’s prepared and served is
up to each team. Salad, soup, vegetables, and enormous amounts
of bread and butter are offered. Pasta is always a staple, usually
doused liberally with olive oil and Parmesan cheese or sauce. Rice
may be served, but not as often. Chicken, fish, or lean meat is usu-
ally simply prepared. A cheese board or dessert may be offered at
the end of the meal, but teams usually eat yogurt or fruit. Most
teams don’t drink alcohol, using it only for celebrations.
Riders consume astonishing amounts of food. Getting adequate
calories in a day to maintain strength and energy is the goal. Riders
on the teams must input enough calories to balance the enormous
caloric output for each day’s stage in order to sustain power and
energy. This is why teams set up tables in the hotel hallways with
high-carb food that riders can eat at any time during the evening,
night, or early in the morning before breakfast. Snacking is encour-
aged, and energy bars are everywhere.
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 113
Bringing your own chef
The only American team at the Tour, the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team (for-
merly the U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team), brings its own chef along. Swiss chef
Willy Balmat supervises and/or prepares all the team meals to insure quality and
proper nutrition. He prepares special egg-white omelettes for breakfast, and often
a special risotto (rice dish) for dinner. He prepares boiled potatoes with olive oil and
salt for the team as post-race snacks; he even makes his own olive oil, using it to
cook for the team. Willy cooks special requests from the riders and tries to provide
variety in their meals, and he celebrates all rider and staff birthdays with a special
cake during the Tour.

Rooming together
Sharing a room with someone for three stressful weeks isn’t always
a pleasant experience. Team management does its best to put two
friends together, but that is not always possible. Small annoyances
like loud music, talking on the phone, and snoring can become
major problems, and because teams often stay in very small
hotels, which means tiny rooms, the two riders can get on each
other’s nerves. Overall, however, there is great camaraderie, toler-
ance, and friendship among teammates. They know they depend
on each other during the Tour.
Listening to music or 
reading a magazine
When riders aren’t giving press interviews in person or on the
phone in the evening, they have free time. Most of riders listen to
music or read magazines and newspapers. Riders have the latest
high-tech music storage and players, and some are known for their
traveling music collections. If their rooms have a television with
more than one channel, they may try to catch clips of Tour events
of the day.
Calling home and cybersurfing
Many riders bring their laptops or PDAs to stay in touch with friends
and family. It’s up to the directeur sportif whether they’re allowed to
spend time surfing the Internet at night, though. Johan Bruyneel,
directeur sportif for the 2005 Discovery Channel Professional Cycling
Team, bans Lance Armstrong from using a laptop for the entire Tour.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
114
Riding and writing
A few riders write daily journals or reports for Web sites. Propping their laptops on
their hotel beds and typing away, they give us the scoop about what really goes on
in the peloton.
Frankie Andreu (see Chapter 4) was one of the first riders to write a daily report
from the Tour. His daily reports were very popular: People loved to read what really
happens in the peloton from a rider’s perspective. Now retired from cycling after
finishing nine Tours, Andreu still writes Tour reports and does television coverage
for OLN during the Tour.

Riders are known for their cellphone use — the phones seem to be
attached to their ears during their free time. Cellphone service is
decent in Europe, but not in remote areas.
Early to bed, early to rise
Many teams have a lights-out time, and the riders are expected
to adhere to that rule. No problem — the hard-working riders are
exhausted at night and often fall asleep very early. Nobody wants
to let their team down by running out of energy during a stage
because they didn’t get enough sleep the night before.
No Rest for the Weary on Rest Day
The Tour organization designates two rest days during the Tour,
usually near the ninth and 16th stages. Theoretically, the day is
spent relaxing and recovering. In practice, these are some of the
busiest days for the teams. If nothing else, fans mob team mem-
bers more on rest days than on other days (see Figure 8-6).
Figure 8-6: Crowds of fans and the press mob the teams during the two rest
days of the Tour.
Chapter 8: Spending a Day in the Life of a Rider 115

Le Grand Boucle (the Big Loop), as the Tour is affectionately called,
circles around the countryside in France. But there are gaps in the
race route where the teams and the entire Tour organization must
travel long distances to get from one stage to another. The only
available time to move the thousands of vehicles, teams, and staff
is on rest days.
Taking the A train: Traveling
The riders and directeurs sportif may fly or take a train on a rest day
to travel to a stage start in a distant town. Using public transporta-
tion means little rest for riders, because they have to deal with
crowds of fans and unending requests for photos and autographs.
When traveling, all riders hope for is to rest or read, undisturbed.
Soigneurs, wrenches, drivers, and other staff must transport team
vehicles to the next hotel. (See Chapter 4 for more on these team
members.) They drive hundreds of kilometers to the next start
location, which means there’s no rest for the team staff, either.
Practice makes perfect, 
even on rest days
When teams arrive at their destination, they head for the hotel and
change into their kits (see Chapter 9). Wrenches set up the bikes,
and riders head out on a training ride to stay in top condition.
They have to ride every day to keep their legs fresh and ready to
go on race morning.

116
The Armstrong chronicles
During the 2004 Tour de France, the Outdoor Life Network sent camera crews that
were dedicated just to filming Lance Armstrong’s quest for his record-breaking sixth
victory. Wherever Armstrong went, OLN followed. OLN reporter Craig Hummer was
assigned specifically to cover Armstrong. Spectators always saw Hummer and his
crew at every start and finish of every stage.
OLN’s television coverage of the Tour drew record ratings for the month of July in
America. According to an OLN press release, on July 25, 2004, gross viewership for
the day was 2.2 million.

Press conferences and interviews
Rest days are also the days when the riders meet with the radio,
television, and newspaper reporters. Interviews are usually sched-
uled by team press agents. Race leaders receive dozens of requests
for interviews.
Sponsors also schedule time for guests, dignitaries, and celebrities
to meet and be photographed with teams on rest days. Guided tour
groups who are affiliated with sponsors also arrange for their entire
group of guests to meet and have photo sessions with teams.

E
quipment rules at the Tour de France, where riders use state-
of-the art bikes, accessories, and apparel. In some instances,
the Tour is the groundbreaking platform for new technology, but
it’s also a race for time-tested technology traditions.
This chapter describes the equipment that teams use. Sponsors’
names may differ, but from wheels to heart rate monitors, frames
to helmets, Tour cyclists are at the forefront of the sport’s cutting
edge of technology.
Using High-Tech Bikes
From a technology standpoint, the Tour is divided into two eras:
1936 and the years before, and 1937 and the years that followed.
 Before 1936: Throughout the event’s first 34 years, riders
were prohibited from using any system that automatically
changed a bike’s gears. If a rider wanted his equipment to
help him more efficiently go up or down a mountain, he had
to get off his bike and manually change gears.
 After 1936: In 1937, innovation prevailed. Since then, Tour
cyclists have been allowed to change gears while riding via a
bike’s derailleurs. Located near the pedals and outside of the
rear wheel, front and rear derailleurs allow easy changing of
gears via a cable system.

The accepted use of derailleurs is one of the Tour’s major technol-
ogy advancements. But event pioneers would likely have been
taken aback by many other technology advancements — from light-
weight bicycle frames to helmets, carbon saddles to disc wheels.
Weighing in on those bikes
According to Union Cycliste Internationale rules, Tour riders, for
safety reasons, must ride bikes that weigh no less than 6.8 kilo-
grams (14.96 pounds). To ensure adherence to this rule, riders’
bikes are weighed periodically during the Tour. If a rider’s bike is
too light, his mechanics scamper to add weight so that the cyclist
can participate.
Bike weight minimum limits aren’t popular among cyclists or among
manufacturers, who attempt to outdo each other by introducing
increasingly lighter bikes and components.
Not so heavy metal
Steel was the metal of choice in early Tour bikes. As the heaviest
of all bike frame metals, steel is still used in many frame tubes
because it’s durable and stiff. But manufacturers’ penchant for
lightness has prompted many new options. Aluminum, titanium,
carbon fiber, and metal-matrix (that is, metal and nonmetal) frames
are readily available and increasingly popular. Titanium alloy is a
popular lightweight option, and it’s corrosion-free but more expen-
sive than other metal choices. Carbon fiber is also lightweight,
wears well, and is more reasonably priced; when manufactured
properly, it can be stiffer than most metals.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
120
Armstrong, the lightweight
Just prior to perhaps the most highly touted stage in Tour de France history, Lance
Armstrong had a problem. It was Stage 16 of the 2004 Tour, the uphill time trial to
L’Alpe d’Huez, and Armstrong couldn’t start. The reason: His bike, a Trek Madone,
was 10 grams too light. Somehow, the U.S. Postal Service Team mechanics had to
find the best way to add weight, the equivalent of about ten paper clips.
After various quick but unsuccessful attempts, a bicycle computer and some bal-
last was added to the pending race winner’s bike. Armstrong’s bike made its weight,
and he rode to the stage victory en route to his sixth consecutive Tour title.

All equipment on the bikes is also designed to be as lightweight as
possible. Bottle cages are measured in grams, and water bottles
are lightweight, as are a rider’s sunglasses. Bike computers, handle
tape, and all bike components are as light as possible.
Ordinary or specially made bikes?
Tour de France riders compete on both specially made bicycles and
bikes available to the general public. Teams use bikes of manufactur-
ing sponsors; Trek, Giant, Look, Colnago, Specialized, Cannondale,
and Pinarello are among more than a dozen manufacturers supply-
ing bikes to Tour riders.
Some teams’ and riders’ bikes are specially made and aren’t avail-
able to the public. Trek, however, supplied bikes to the U.S. Postal
Service Team (now the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team)
during Lance Armstrong’s sixth Tour title run, and the company
promoted its Madone model as the bike Armstrong used in the
2004 Tour de France.
Although most riders use a specific manufacturer’s model, they
also use different bikes within a category. Armstrong, for example,
used a slightly heavier, more durable bike during early stages of
the 2004 Tour that included rough, cobblestone sections. In road
stages that included climbs, Armstrong switched to a lighter road
bike, which television commentators sometimes referred to as
Lance’s mountain bike.
Time trial bikes
Because time trials are individual races timed against the clock,
riders use more aerodynamically constructed bikes than they do
in the rest of the Tour. Each team still uses its sponsoring manufac-
turer’s equipment, but construction of time trial bikes and road
bikes is vastly different.
Cyclists are positioned closer to the front of a time trial bike, via a
shorter wheelbase, for pedaling power. The frame and handlebars
are designed to enhance aerodynamics. Time trial bikes are also
ridden while equipped with solid disc or spoked wheels. Most riders
use spoked wheels (with as few as three carbon-made spokes), but
on short time-trial courses with little or no wind, riders often use a
rear disc wheel along with a front spoked wheel. It’s rare for a rider
to use two disc wheels, because potential windsail effect could
increase control problems and, consequently, affect his finishing
time or even his ability to finish. 
Chapter 9: Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch 121

If time trial bikes are so much faster, why don’t riders use them in
all the stages? The answer lies in the rulebook. The Union Cycliste
Internationale has rules that limit the technology and geometry of
frames for different types of races, so a time trial bike can be used
only in a time trial.
Wheels Go Round and Round
Every Tour bike has two wheels, but what wheels riders use is as
diverse as cyclists’ personalities. Like bike frames, cycling shoes,
attire, and various other equipment, riders use wheels provided
by sponsoring manufacturers. Rims, tires, and spokes are far more
advanced than they were during the Tour’s infancy; in fact, because
of rim strength and new technology, wheels no longer need as many
spokes for support as they used to.
What wheels riders use is determined by weather conditions and,
to some degree, by team and rider preference. Tour cyclists prima-
rily use two types of wheels:
 Spoked wheels: Depending on weather conditions and course
terrain, riders use traditional spoked wheels with as many as
20 spokes. But cyclists can also use spoked wheels with three
carbon spokes (see Figure 9-1) to help with aerodynamic effi-
ciency. Spoke wheels are lighter than disc wheels, so they’re
also used in uphill time trials.
 Solid-disc wheels: These wheels are reserved for use during
individual time trials and team time trials. The discs are made
of carbon fiber, and they’re the best way for riders to reduce
resistance in low-wind conditions.
Figure 9-1: U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team time trial bicycles with Hed wheels.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
122

A windless day is a perfect time trial day. Solid disc wheels provide
ideal aerodynamics for time trials. But on windy days, solid disc
wheels often prove ineffective, because they act like sails. Cyclists
opt for tri-spoke wheels or traditional spoke wheels during windy
time trials.
Shifting Gears
Like driving a manual-transmission car, cyclists shift their bike
gears depending upon terrain, the speed they’re trying to achieve,
and their preferred cadence (pedal strokes per minute). This sec-
tion explains how shifting works.
A rider uses a low gear to increase his cadence and a high gear to
decrease his cadence. A higher gear at the same cadence increases
speed.
Cogs, cassettes, and cranks
Seemingly as many varieties of cogs, cassettes. and cranks are mar-
keted as there are riders in the peloton. Tour bikes generally have
ten cogs, and they are collectively known as the cassette. A cog, also
known as a chain ring, is attached to the crank, the shafts attached
to the pedals. 
Each cog has teeth; the smallest cog has 11 and the largest 27, which
is used for extremely steep mountains. The chain ring on the front of
the bike has from 39 to 53 teeth.
Lance Armstrong often opts to use a 39 × 21 (which means 39 teeth
on the front cog and 21 teeth on the rear cog) while climbing;
Australian sprinting specialist Robbie McEwen uses a 53 × 11 com-
bination in mass sprints at the end of flat road stages. 
Cranks, also available in different metals and sizes, are two arms to
which pedals are attached. They’re particularly important because
power from rider’ legs is directly transferred to the bike via cranks. 
What gears do they use?
Depending upon a rider’s size and weight and the terrain he’s
riding, gear ratios can vary greatly. Riders like Jan Ullrich, the 1997
Tour winner, enjoy pushing gears to sustain a slow, steady cadence,
particularly while climbing. Lance Armstrong, who has climbed
Tour mountains with Ullrich in many Tour stages, prefers smaller
Chapter 9: Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch 123

climbing gear ratios by spinning, which means he’s pedaling at a
faster cadence.
While there are several preferred gearing standards, how big or
small gears riders shift into is a personal choice. Tour riders can
switch into cogs with gears with a low rating (the number of teeth)
and into the mid-50s. The higher the number of the front cog and
the lower the number of the back cog, the more the difficult the
pedal stroke.
Use a triple, be a wimp?
Most Tour bikes are equipped with two front chain rings,which is
the same as the two front cogs. Occasionally, riders have added a
third ring — a triple — in the Tour of Italy and Tour of Spain. But
those two Grand Tours include mountain stages with more severe
gradients than the Tour de France. Adding a third chain ring can
increase the possibility of mechanical problems, because it further
complicates gearing.
A Helmet Is a Helmet — Not!
Designing and engineering helmets for Tour riders is serious busi-
ness. Designers are hoping to save a gram or two of weight, offer a
sleek aerodynamic design, allow for excellent extreme ventilation,
and protect the rider in the event of an accident. Teams work
closely with their helmet sponsors, getting helmets as close to per-
fection as possible. What you may think of as “just a helmet” is
actually the work of skill and art to a team that wants a cutting-
edge advantage.

Looking back at helmet history
In the 1880s, when cyclists rode high-wheel bicycles, their head protection was
sometimes a pith helmet. Protective headgear evolved into beanies, called hair-
nets, made of padded leather strips that protected mostly cyclists’ ears.
Bowl-shaped polystyrene foam helmets and helmets with hard shells and foam
liners were the next phase of helmets marketed. Rounded, bowling-ball shapes
allowed helmets to skid along paved surfaces, minimizing impact. In the mid-1980s,
manufacturers such as Giro began experimenting with aerodynamic designs and
hi-tech materials. A new era in bicycle helmets emerged, with strong advocates for
and against using helmets for cycling safety.

Dude, you gotta wear ’em!
Wearing a helmet is no longer an option or riders. As discussed in
Chapter 5, in 2003, Union Cycliste Internationale set mandatory reg-
ulations for wearing helmets during races. Many riders disagree
with this rule, which was imposed after the death of a racer during
Paris-Nice, a renowned spring classic race.
Andrei Kivilev, of Kazakhstan, riding for Cofidis, fell about 40 kilo-
meters (24.8 miles) from the second stage finish. It was a slow-
speed crash: Some said it was caused by touching wheels; others
thought he was looking down while adjusting his earpiece or sun-
glasses. It was sudden, swift, and unexpected, with not one second
to react or prepare. The crash didn’t seem serious, and the peloton
raced on. But Kivilev fell, taking full impact on his face. He wasn’t
wearing a helmet, and he eventually died from his injuries, leaving a
young wife and six-month-old son. The peloton was devastated by
his loss, and many riders wept openly before starting the next
morning. Riders decided to neutralize the third stage in the rider’s
honor. A moment of silence was followed by a solemn procession
along the race route to the finish line. Physicians have speculated
that Kivilev may have lived if he had been wearing a helmet, and his
death further continues the Tour de France helmet controversy.
Union Cycliste Internationale also tried in 1991 to initiate a compul-
sory helmet rule. Ironically, riders at that time staged a protest
during the Paris-Nice race, so the sport’s governing body backed
off from the issue.
Even with the new rule, there are a times when helmets can be
removed: Riders, at their own risk, can remove their helmets for
the final climb, in order to remain cool, if the finish is on an uphill
section or at the top of the hill, under the following conditions: 
 The uphill section is at least 5 kilometers (3 miles) long.
 The helmet is not removed before the start of the uphill section
While watching the Tour, take notice of who’s wearing his helmet
and when. You don’t often see a rider tossing away his helmet;
instead, the team car guards expensive headgear. Helmets may be
custom fit, and a team may not have many extra helmets in the
team truck.
Protection versus ventilation
A major challenge in helmet design is providing maximum protec-
tion as well as maximum ventilation. A racer sweating along roads
Chapter 9: Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch 125

in France in sweltering heat needs maximum ventilation from his
helmet. Airflow is critical to carrying away body heat in summer
temperatures and moisture in cold temperatures. In fact, research
by the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute shows that a well ventilated
helmet is cooler in summer heat than a bare head. This is why
many helmets are advertised by the number of vents they contain.
But a rider also needs maximum protection from crashes. A sleek,
240-gram, 18-vent helmet provides excellent ventilation, but it also
needs to have maximum impact performance. A helmet has to be
designed to manage the crash energy and protect the head and
brain. Having larger vents and lighter helmet shells doesn’t always
provide maximum protection.
Ask a pro rider what he wants in a helmet, and he’ll likely say he’s
looking for a model with minimum weight and maximum ventila-
tion. But riders wear sponsor helmets, regardless of ventilation or
weight.
Time trial helmets: Aerodynamics
is everything
Polycarbonate shells, painstakingly designed and tested in wind tun-
nels, are standard for time trial helmets. Sculpted designs, experi-
mentations with materials and textures, and lab testing at every
stage all help to produce a helmet that can claim a time trial win.
Ventilation is not usually a priority for time trial helmets, given the
short length of the races, nor do helmets offer much impact protec-
tion. Because micro-thin shells aren’t lined, ventilation comes from
air circulating under the shell, but it’s in lieu of impact protection.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
126
Doing the daily laundry
Riders are issued only a minimal amount of team clothing. They don’t have an unlim-
ited number of jerseys and shorts. As soon as riders return to their hotel, they put
dirty laundry into mesh bags and place the bags outside their room doors. A
soigneur picks up bags and heads for the nearest Laundromat. All clothing and mesh
bags are labeled with each rider’s name. You won’t see an exhausted, hungry rider
with a hectic evening schedule washing his socks in a motel bathroom.
For non-riding occasions, each rider receives casual pants, shirts, sweat suits, and
tennis shoes with sponsor logos.

Sleek, aerodynamic designs with minimal wind profile and wind
drag are optimal time trial helmet benefits. Time trial helmets weigh
about 8 ounces. Their design includes an aerodynamic tail that
extends in the rear to provide unfettered air flow over riders’ backs,
and their unique shape looks like an outer-space creation (see
Figure 9-2). These newfangled shapes are excellent for time trials
and are standard in European races. But engineers in the United
States are working on new models, because they believe tear-
dropped-shaped helmets can snag on roads in crashes and cause
severe head and neck twists. Louis Garneau and Shain are compa-
nies offering time trial helmets approved for use in U.S. racing.
Figure 9-2: Time trial helmets hanging in the U. S. Postal Service Cycling
Team truck.
Wearing a Kaleidoscope of Kits
A kit is a rider’s uniform. A rider’s full kit, that is, the entire ensem-
ble of clothing he’ll wear during the year, includes the following:
 Jersey: A jersey is a top that riders wear. Riders wear team jer-
seys (adorned with numerous sponsor logos) that are form-
fitting, so that nothing flaps around to cause wind resistance.
Chapter 9: Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch 127

Jersey material is breathable, wicks moisture away from the
body, is soft and supple, and doesn’t chafe. A jersey usually
has three back pockets to hold food, a water bottle, a rolled-up
vest, jacket or gloves, or whatever else the rider needs to carry.
 Shorts: Shorts are made of Lycra/Spandex for flexibility and
comfort, with padding that wicks moisture away from the
skin. Riders are particular about the fit and comfort of their
shorts. A rough seam can feel like a saw blade after hours in
the saddle, and resulting sores can jeopardize a rider’s ability
to remain in the race.
 Bib: A bib is a one-piece top/short combinations. The top por-
tion looks like a tank top, while the bottom is just like cycling
shorts. Bibs are made of moisture-wicking mesh; that is, mate-
rial that draws moisture away from the skin. 
 Jackets and vests: Jackets and vests are made of windproof,
water-resistant, breathable fabrics and can be either thermal
(warm) or just wind-proof. They’re always covered with spon-
sors’ logos. Jackets are often vented with mesh under the arms.
Rain jackets are (you guessed it) windproof, waterproof, and
breathable. Arm warmers and leg warmers are used for cold
weather riding and are made of similar high-tech materials.
 Caps (riding and knit): In cold weather, a rider may wear a
knit cap or a headband made of thermal fabric that insulates
and wicks away moisture. A knit cap has to fit snugly under
the helmet. Riding caps are beanies with mini-visors, plastered
with sponsor logos. Considering recent helmet regulations,
riders mostly wear caps on training rides, but some riders
occasionally wear caps under their helmets.
 Thermal undershirt: Riders wear layers of clothing for warmth;
most riders prefer exterior layers that they can easily remove
while riding, given the extreme weather changes during Tour
routes. So, if a rider chooses to wear a thermal undershirt, he
wears it for the entire stage — that’s why a fabric that’s breath-
able, moisture-wicking material, such as CoolMax, is essential.
Riders generally wear a thermal undershirt when they know the
entire racing day will feature cold weather.
 Gloves: Gloves are for crash protection, for warmth, and to
avoid having sweaty hands slip off the handlebars. Most
riders wear traditional, fingerless (called half-gloves) when
riding. But in extremely cold weather conditions, riders wear
weatherproof, full-finger gloves.
Gloves are designed and manufactured using innovative tech-
nology, such as carbon infused leather, thermal windproof
fabric, breathable mesh, and/or moisture-wicking microfibers.
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
128

Many gloves offer padding against vibration and have nonslip
material on fingers and palms.
 Shoes and socks: Cycling shoes are made with lightweight,
high-quality materials, such as carbon fiber. Quality workman-
ship and utmost attention to fit is essential for performance
and comfort. State-of-the-art, high-tech engineering provides
perfect design and fit. Shimano, one well-known cycling com-
pany, believes cycling shoes are the most critical interface
between rider and bike.
Socks worn by each team vary, based on the team sponsor’s
product and personal preference. In general, cycling socks are
made of breathable fabric, like CoolMax, Micro Denier, or Micro
Supreme, that wicks moisture away. Cycling socks need to be
soft, form-fitting, and with no friction that could cause sores.
 Booties: Booties (sock-like boots that fit over the top of a
rider’s shoes) have two functions: aerodynamics and warmth.
Booties are almost always used in time trials, and they’re
lightweight, sleek, and help minimize wind resistance. Riders
all wear booties with unified color and sponsors’ logos. Cold
weather brings out team booties, too, even during non-time-
trial races. Booties come in different thicknesses and materi-
als for various weather conditions.
But when you hear someone refer to a rider’s kit, it usually means
team attire he’s wearing. All team members wear the same kit, in
team colors. Shoes are the exception. A cycling shoe manufacturer
usually sponsors an individual rider, not an entire team, so you
may see George Hincapie wearing Carnac shoes, while his team-
mate Lance Armstrong is wearing Nike shoes.
Sponsors’ logos usually provide basic color schemes for team kits,
and often become part of team nicknames. For example, Team
Saeco was known as the Red Train and the U.S. Postal Service
Cycling Team (now the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team) was
known as Le Train Bleu, or the Blue Train.
Chapter 9: Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch 129
Cap frenzy
During the Tour de France, Europeans, especially French and Belgian cycling fans,
covet little beanie-like team caps. If you in any way look like you might be with a
team or sponsor, you may be asked, “casquette? casquette?” Casquette means
cap, and a new team cycling cap is a prized possession for fans.

Weightless is the goal
From jerseys to shoes to water bottle cages, one goal and obses-
sion for a rider is to reduce weight. Decreasing weight and wind
resistance for a rider’s kit may give a few seconds’ advantage and
result in a spot on the podium.
Given that some Tour de France wins are measured in seconds, a
lightweight, form-fitting, minimal-wind-drag jersey can give a 30-
second advantage during a 140-kilometer stage. It sounds trivial
for a three-week race, but 30 seconds can give a winning margin
between two riders. So designers create lightweight microfiber
materials that wick moisture away from rider’s bodies and fit tightly
to reduce wind resistance. Three pockets are placed strategically
on the jersey’s lower back to avoid wind drag. Jersey collars are
designed to zip for a close, tight fit. Placement of seams is vital —
preferably, there are no seams at all. And always, it’s essential that
moisture be carried away from the body.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours are
spent researching materials to provide perfect form, function, and
performance. Nike, Trek, Specialized, Descente, Nalini, Vermark,
and Giordana are all well known cycling research companies.
These companies power the research and innovation in cycling
clothing, manufacturing it with advanced product technology,
including microfiber polyester materials that provide warmth,
cooling, and windproof moisture control.
Riders are particularly concerned about engineering and materials
for their shorts. Shorts (and jerseys, too) must be stretchy and
comfortable for hours of wear, with no areas that bind or chafe.
Shorts are lined with a soft padding known as chamois (pro-
nounced shammy) to prevent chafing and irritation and to provide
some padding for the long days in the saddle. A great variety and
quality of chamois is available, and riders are constantly trying to
find the perfect one. Riders also smear chamois cream on both
Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike

Lots o’ stuff
What do riders do with all the stuff — from jerseys to booties — when they change
teams or get new gear? A group of professional riders in Boulder, Colorado, decided
to band together and sell their old stuff. You probably won’t find any Tour de France
goodies on this site, but check out www.theprosstuff.com for bargains and
up-to-date news and gossip.

their shorts and their bodies to prevent painful saddle sores. Keep
in mind that the pain from saddle sores and boils can force riders
to abandon the Tour.
Wearing time trial skinsuits
Time trial kits are special aerodynamic, one-piece skinsuits made
with innovative, ultra-lightweight fabrics in varied textures. Some
skinsuits have a dimpled texture that provides surface turbulence
in certain areas of the rider’s body, which increases speed. (This
technique is also used for competitive swimmers’ skinsuits,
because research shows a skinsuit moves faster through air and
water than bare skin does.) Skinsuits are seamless, or they have as
few seams as possible that are strategically placed to prevent wind
drag. Lightweight mesh may be used in some areas of the skinsuit
for ventilation and cooling. 
The goal is always to minimize weight and wind-drag. A standard
team kit, no matter how form-fitting, creates substantial wind-drag:
Seams, pockets, zippers, thick elastic at the bottom of the shorts
all create wind-drag and weight for the rider. A skinsuit, on the
other hand, weighs up to 30 percent less than a regular team kit. 
When talk turns to time trial kits, it’s inevitable the Nike–Lance
Armstrong partnership comes up. Nike, as a major sponsor of
the U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team (now called the Discovery
Channel Pro Cycling Team), researched and engineered a skinsuit
for Armstrong’s 2004 Tour de France win. Nike’s goal was an
extremely lightweight, cooling, breathable suit with minimal wind
drag. The skinsuit was almost 22 percent lighter than a standard
Tour-issue skinsuit and was made available for all Tour classifica-
tion leaders to wear, if they chose.
Chapter 9: Having the Best Equipment in the Bunch 131
Getting that layered look
Tour cyclists have an advantage over recreational cyclists: Pros have a team car,
so they can discard or add clothing as weather dictates. But even pros wear multi-
layered kits. Advanced technology allows riders to wear layers of warm, lightweight
clothing that can be easily removed while riding.
A fascinating sight is seeing a rider cruising along at 30 miles per hour while remov-
ing his leg warmers (tube-shaped pieces that slip over tights or bare legs) or booties
(sock-like boots that fit over the tops of shoes). Another rider may lend a helping sup-
port hand, but more often than not, you see quite a one-man, one-leg balancing act.

Part III: Loving the Ride: A Man and His Bike 
132
Adding pizzazz to a skinsuit
Great Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini is known for his flamboyant style. He’s famous
for wearing outrageous attire, resulting in fines from race officials for violating uni-
form regulations. But Cipollini’s sponsors, who’ve received massive additional pub-
licity for Cipollini’s style choices, gladly pay those fines. 
Zebra stripes and an anatomically correct skeleton — both printed on aerodynamic
skinsuits — and a king outfit, complete with cape and crown, are among Cipollini’s
most more famous Tour apparel selections. 
In the 2004 Tour de France, the length of Cipollini’s skinsuit violated official rules.
But race photographers took plenty of images, and Cipolllini’s sponsors’ logos were
prominently displayed. Still, in order to compete, the legs of Cipollini’s skinsuit had
to be shortened with scissors just prior to the day’s stage.

Cybering the Tour
Easily accessible at all hours, the Internet provides a wealth of
information, news, and history about the Tour de France. Some
Internet sites featuring the Tour de France come and go, yet many
sites run by newspaper or magazine corporations are steady and
consistent. So although information, news, and gossip are at your
fingertips, remember that everything you read is not necessarily

always a good idea.
Web sites listed here are valid at the time of this writing, but sites

Fan sites
Cycling fans are no different than fans of any other sport. They’re
fiercely loyal and supportive of their favorite riders and teams. In
Italy, fans are called tifosi. They’re fervent in their adoration of
favorite racers. Tifosi are everywhere in the world for their favorite

Motorcycle units: Speeding
down twisting roads
France 3 Television production and camera crews look like a small army as they
move into action each day. Several France 3 production trucks, with thousands of
feet of cables and wiring, assemble in the media technical parking area. Dozens of
technicians swing into a chaotic, yet efficiently organized, plan to ensure that film-
ing the day’s stage will work flawlessly. France 3 has six to eight motorcycle units
(called motos) with cameras and commentators that shoot close-ups of racers. 
Riders often descend narrow, twisting mountain roads at such speeds that it’s
impossible for most vehicles to keep up with leading racers, so motorcycle units
are the only source of live action transmission for television. Each camera person
has to be really gutsy, because she or he sits or stands in these fast-moving motor-
cycles. It is extremely risky for drivers to maintain control with weighty camera
equipment and an extra rider, even more so on wet roads. 
Motorcycle units transmit race action to low-flying helicopters, which relay the
footage to France 3 production units at the finish line. Hundreds of other radio and
television trucks and equipment are parked in the technical area, all using the same
live global feed.

d’Huez are the best (and sometimes, the worst) examples of tifosi.
You can find dozens of Internet sites for many great cyclists, both
present and past, by using an Internet search engine. Again, a
warning that fan sites can be very transient, so you may receive a

Classic, unknown, and 
weird cycling movies
When cycling movies are mentioned, it’s usually the classic 1979
film Breaking Away. Along with American Flyer, these two movies
offer a limited choice for cycling-starved fans during winter months. 
Chapter 10: Perfecting the Art of Spectating from Home 145

Googling around a couple of years ago, one of your authors discov-
ered a Web site treasure that lists over 100 cycling films. You’ll
need to Google the phrase cycling films big list to find this site by
Séamus King (the URL is too long and ugly to list here). The site is
well worth the Google search.
Looking for a charming film? Belleville Rendez-Vous, also called The
Triplets of Belleville, is a film by Sylvain Choumet. Also explore the
Web site for this movie at www.bellevillerendezvous.com.

Getting maps and marking the route
Getting into fine details about routes for each stage of the Tour is
another way of knowing what’s happening. Many fans who attend
the Tour mark routes for every stage of the Tour, even if they’re
viewing from only one spot along the road. Try it — get a road map
of France and a marker pen, and trace the route map (see Figure
10-2) as if you were going there yourself. That way, even if you
can’t be there in person, you can still map out the Tour and be in
the know about where the race is going.

Speaking the language
Knowing a few key words and phrases in French is helpful, even if
you’re spectating from home. And spending some fun time to learn
a few basics goes a long way toward increasing your enjoyment of
the Tour.
We highly recommend French Phrases For Dummies by Dodi-Katrin
Schmidt, Michelle M. Williams, and Dominique Wenzel (Wiley). Pick
up a copy and you’ll be in the know, translating those French expla-
nations and race cartoons on your screen with flair.
Knowing about the 
publicity caravan
Watching the publicity caravan, or caravane publícitaire, on televi-
sion gives you a taste of what it’s like to be there in person. (See
Chapter 11 for more on making the trip.) Basically, what spectators
see is a gigantic parade of sponsor vehicles that precedes the race
by an hour or so. Take a look at Figure 10-3.

Figure 10-3: The publicity caravan lines up under threatening skies.
Madness and Mardi Gras mixed together
Slowly winding along the route, this bizarre caravan of some 200
sponsor vehicles travels the entire stage route each day, including
steep and winding mountain roads. From tiny one-person cars to
semi-trucks, this collection of Mardi Gras–like floats stirs fans into
a frenzy.
Looking like a Rose Bowl parade without flowers, floats are giant
icons for Tour sponsors. It’s an onslaught of bigger-than-life spon-
sor representations: huge fiberglass PMU (Paris Mutuel Urbain, a
French off-track betting system for horse-racing) jockeys riding
horses, a giant Michelin doughboy, the 10-foot-tall Crédit Lyonnais
lions, music blaring from loudspeakers, and nonstop dancers teth-
ered to floats for safety.
Nestlé Aquarel, a major sponsor, has a fire truck float with “fire-
men” who spray the crowd with fire hoses and dangle bottles of
water from fishing poles to tantalize hot, thirsty crowds. Aquarel
distributes about 14,000 water bottles a day to teams and fans.
Wanting tacky things
Crowd frenzy is generated by trinkets that sponsor floats throw to
pleading fans. Key rings, tiny packets (containing candy, sausage,
or cheese), musette bags (bags given to riders containing food),
rain hats, plastic trinkets, pens, red-checkered caps, and bottles
of water are randomly thrown to crowds. People are delighted to
catch these trinkets, grabbing and shoving to grab items mid-air,
and they display their prizes with glee.

Chapter 10: Perfecting the Art of Spectating from Home 149
Knowing sponsor factoids
Crédit Lyonnais, a humongous international banking and financial institution, is a
major sponsor of the Tour, sponsoring the maillot jaune, or yellow jersey (see
Chapter 3). The company distributes signature yellow caps and goodie bags every-
where along the Tour route. Crédit Lyonnais also has a traveling bank that accom-
panies the Tour, and it’s the only bank in France open on Bastille Day, a French
national holiday.
Supermarché Champion is an enormous supermarket chain in France that spon-
sors the red and white polka-dot jersey awarded for the best climber classification
(see Chapter 3 for information on the various jerseys).
Nestlé Aquarel supplies the bottled water for the Tour (roughly a million bottles in
three weeks), while Skoda is the official supplier for hundreds of official Tour vehi-
cles. Skoda sponsors the white jersey, awarded to the Tour’s best young rider.
PMU (Paris Mutuel Urbain) is the French national horse betting monopoly, in busi-
ness since 1930, and sponsors the green jersey. PMU distributes giant green hands
that fans love, but riders and photographers hate. Fun for fans, but riders get cuts
and bruises from being pounded with the green hands during finishes.
Photographers moan when dozens of giant green hands are blocking their perfect
finish shot.
All of these sponsors participate in the publicity caravan, have a presence at the
Village Départ, and are visible everywhere at the Tour. Millions of Euros flow into the
Tour organization from sponsors, a necessity to keep the Tour thriving.

Going to the Tour: 
A Brief Guide
In This Chapter
 Choosing your touring mode: Group or individual
 Knowing where to watch
 Finishing on the Champs Élysées
T
he Tour de France organization estimates that 15 million specta-
tors line the route each year as the Tour starts, winding around
the countryside and in the mountains of France. Spectating at the
Tour is an art as well as an exercise in assertiveness, endurance,
and tenacity. Map-reading skills, driving skills, and language skills
are a prerequisite to survival as a spectator.
The exhilaration of seeing the publicity caravan (see Chapter 10)
and peloton (main group of riders) flashing by brings fans back
year after year. For many cycling fans, it is the experience of a life-
time. This chapter is a brief overview of choices and options for
planning a trip to the Tour.
On Your Own or with a Tour Group
Deciding how you’re going to see the Tour de France is a
decision you have to make months before the Tour starts in July.
Reservations with Tour groups for the next year’s Tour fill up
almost immediately after the current Tour de France ends. Lodging
in France is booked as soon as the following year’s Tour route is
announced at the end of October.
However, if you’re adventurous and flexible, it’s quite possible to
head over to France at the last minute and view the race with last-
minute lodging and travel arrangements. First-class or budget,
with a tour group or on your own, the Tour can be your summer
destination.

Selecting packaged tours
Letting someone else take care of all the details may be your idea
of Tour heaven. If so, a tour package may be just right. If all you
want to do is get your passport, change dollars to euros, and pack
your luggage and bike, then signing up for a tour group is the way
to go.
First, decide what kind of guided Tour experience you’re looking
for, because many tour groups allow you to ride for part of the trip
(see Figure 11-1). Do you want to take your bike or travel totally on
four wheels? If you’re a cyclist and you’re not going solo, is your
companion a cyclist, or does he or she need non-cyclist accommo-
dations? Do you want only a brief look at a stage or two, or do you
want to see the entire three-week race? (If nothing else, your
budget may make some decisions for you.)
Part IV: Watching the Race 
152
Picking it up fast
Enhance your Tour experience and lessen stress by doing your homework before
you leave. Learning about France and its history, traditions, and customs will vastly
increase your comfort level.
For example, July 14th is Bastille Day, a French national holiday. Nearly all busi-
nesses close to celebrate the holiday. Along the Autoroute, gas stations with con-
venience stores may be open, but in small villages, all business stops. Gas stations
and shops are closed, and owners are on holiday. If you need to buy anything, you’re
probably out of luck.
In addition, memorizing a few key French phrases also facilitates your Tour de
France experience, and a smiling “bonjour” (good day) goes a long way toward
helping with communication difficulties.
Be sure to pick up a copy of three key For Dummies books as must-have travel
resources:
 France For Dummies by Darwin Porter, Danforth Prince, and Cheryl A. Pientka
(Wiley)
 French Phrases For Dummies by Dodi-Katrin Schmidt, Michelle M. Williams,
and Dominique Wenzel (Wiley)
 French For Dummies by Dodi-Katrin Schmidt, Michelle M. Williams, and
Dominique Wenzel (Wiley)

Figure 11-1: Tour group bikes are parked after riding up La Mongie.
Finding a tour group that has space available may be more of a
challenge — many groups fill up soon after the Tour de France 
finishes at the end of July. Do a little Internet research and ask
friends or folks in your bike club. Word-of-mouth recommendations
about tour packages are good, but try to get at least one second
opinion, too.
Here are some questions to ask when looking at options at tour
group options:
 How long has the company been in business and how many
Tours has it done? Is the Tour de France its specialty? What is
the specific route, and how much of the Tour will you really
see? How many starts and how many finishes? Will you be
viewing in villages or along the road in the mountains?
 Who will be leading the group and how many staff people does
the company have? Are the guides experienced cyclists, and
how many times has your particular guide done the Tour?
 What are the reservation and cancellation policies? What cur-
rency is required for payment? Are credit cards accepted?
(If the company accepts credit cards, it may give you a little
more protection.) When are deposits and balances due? What
is the policy on return of deposits?
 Will the company provide you with contact info for references?
Will they connect you with other guests in your area before the
trip begins?
Chapter 11: Going to the Tour: A Brief Guide 153

 What specifically does their tour package include, and what’s
not included? (Airfare is usually not included, but most com-
panies do pick you up from the airport. Some meals may
be included, and most lodging in France also includes a
small breakfast.) Are snacks and water provided during the
travel day?
 What is the form of transportation? Will it be motor coaches
or passenger vans. Who will be driving and how are those
drivers qualified?
 What about lodging? (Three-star hotels are standard for most
tour groups.) Is it shared rooming? (Most groups are based on
double occupancy.) What is the cost of a single room? How
often will you change hotels during the trip?
 How many people will be in the tour group? How many bus or
van loads of people? Will it be all adults or will there be fami-
lies? Does the company make provisions for non-cyclists in
the group? Will the tour be canceled if not enough people
sign up?
 If you’re cycling, what is the fitness level expected? How long
will the rides be? Is there a support vehicle that will follow
you, and will staff be riding along with you?
 Does the tour operator provide specific schedules, maps, and
meeting points for each day? If you’re cycling, will you receive
a clear and detailed route sheet to your destination, as well as
mechanical support?
Selecting a tour group that best fits your requirements and your
budget can be time-consuming, but it is vital, so start early and
choose carefully.
If you plan to cycle during your trip, make sure you choose a tour
group that accommodates your level of cycling. For your enjoy-
ment and safety, you want to ride at your level of skill and training.
Make sure the tour operator understands your cycling experience
and your training plan. And yes, you need to follow a training plan
well in advance of cycling with a group at the Tour.
Cycling with celebrities
Many tour groups offer the opportunity to travel with a cycling
celebrity who has ridden the Tour de France. Hearing first-hand
stories, analysis of strategies, and getting the scoop on Tour riders
adds fun and excitement to your experience.

Former Tour cyclists Steve Bauer, Frankie Andreu, Kevin Livingston,
Phil Anderson, Neil Stephens, and Marty Jemison offer tour groups.
Having an opportunity to get first-hand tips from Chris Carmichael,
Lance Armstrong’s coach, while you ride could be the pinnacle of
your Tour trip. If cycling with celebrities appeals to you, check out
trips listed in the “Finding tour groups for le Tour” sidebar to see
which tours offer a cycling star.
Doing the Tour on your own
Many cycling fans prefer to make their own travel plans or even
head over to France without formal plans or reservations at all. 
If you’re the type who just throws jeans, T shirts, a toothbrush, and
sleeping bag into a backpack and takes off, read no further. Grab
your maps and head over to France for a great adventure! You’ll
meet many people doing spontaneous traveling and also seeing the

get started.

Tour. France is hospitable and generous to free-spirited Tour visi-
tors, if you’re polite and respectful of customs and traditions.
Planning your own trip takes many hours and includes determining
your route, deciding where you want to view each stage, and find-
ing lodging that will be compatible with your viewing plans and
budget. Be sure to take into account your driving times and dis-
tances in kilometers from stage starts to finishes.
You can find the Tour route on the official Tour de France Web site
at www.letour.fr. Click on the country flag for language options.
There, you find a map of France, with town-to-town stage routes,
a flash version of the route map, and detailed information about
towns along the route.
You absolutely must have at least one detailed map of France; many
folks use a large folding map and also a road atlas of France. We rec-
ommend Frommer’s Road Atlas France, with detailed road mapping
and town plans. Get out some highlighting pens and draw every
stage of the Tour route in one color, and the route that you will drive
or ride in another color. Spending time and paying attention to
details at this stage pays off when you’re driving the roads in France.
The first task is to get your flight reserved as soon as you can —
start searching early in the calendar year, if possible, for the best
deals. If you wait until the last minute, many airlines are booked for
the day before the Tour begins and for the day after the Tour ends.
If you decide to travel a few days before the Tour starts or after it
ends, check online for better deals.
Don’t put anything of value into your checked-in luggage.
Unfortunately, items like expensive digital camera batteries,
memory cards, or other items that you may not necessarily think
of as “valuables” can end up missing from suitcases or backpacks.
One American rider had his jersey, worn during a stage win (never
washed and with his number still on it), stolen out of his backpack
after his baggage was checked.

Ted Arnold’s Self-Guided Tour de France
How about an expert helping hand with your Tour planning? Ted Arnold, an experi-
enced guide for the Tour de France, writes a how-to-do-it-yourself book every year,
and it’s a gold mine of information.
To order this invaluable guide, go to www.velotainment.com. There, Ted also
has an interesting and informative blog that you may want to check out.

If you’re flying into Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris,
and it’s your first time, plan on a hectic, confusing, and chaotic
experience. Allow extra time to ask questions, get lost, and stand
in long lines with passport in hand at Customs. And be sure to grab
a free luggage cart, because you may be walking a long way to the
rental car area. Relax — you’ll figure it all out and find your way.
Details, Details, Details
Taking care of all the major details — as well as the nitty-gritty
ones — before you leave pays off when you’ve driven for hours
and are stuck in traffic somewhere along the Tour route. Teams at
the Tour have everything planned down to the nth degree, and so
can you. This section shows you how.
Transportation details
Choosing your form of transportation is an important detail. Will
you drive a vehicle while following the Tour route? If so, you may
choose to rent a small economy car, a luxurious sedan with GPS, a
camper van, or a large recreation vehicle.
If you’re staying three weeks or longer, you may want to look at a
buy-back arrangement (also called a short-term lease). Renault and
Peugeot have programs where you “buy” a brand-new vehicle,
drive it for unlimited miles, and then the company buys it back
from you on your return date. What are the advantages in buy-back
over renting? 
 You have many choices from economy to luxury, depending
on your budget. 
 Your vehicle is also brand-new, and you can specify the model
and even the color. 
 The vehicle is fully insured with no deductible, and it’s tax-
free, which means no VAT (value-added tax) is charged. 
This arrangement involves more paperwork, which is mailed to you
and completed ahead of time, but the pick-up and return process is
the same as for a rental vehicle. Auto Europe (www.autoeurope.
com) handles the online or telephone reservations for Peugeot.
Renault USA (www.renaultusa.com) handles the arrangements for
the Renault buy-back program.
When you’re seeing only a couple of stages that begin or end in a
town with a train station, you’ll find that traveling via rail is simple,
Chapter 11: Going to the Tour: A Brief Guide 157

fast, and efficient. SNCF is the French national railway. Trains run
frequently and they stay on schedule; station attendants are help-
ful and speak some English.
You can take your boxed bicycles on designated trains in France
(TGV and Corail are two French railroad companies), loading them
into the luggage area. Porters or baggage carriers are available only
in main stations like Paris, however, so what you take, you carry.
While hitch-hiking is a common form of Tour viewing, because of
the inherent risks of hopping into cars with strangers, we don’t
recommend this. But during the Tour, standing along the route at
an intersection or road junction with a handwritten sign telling
where you’re heading will almost always get you a lift. Use caution,
exercise good judgment, and be aware that hitching is not a good
idea for solo traveling.
Cyclists number in the thousands along Tour routes, so if you
decide to bike to the stages, you’ll have good company and great
support. Choose your riding distance carefully and leave early.
Maps that you purchased previously and highlighted (see the pre-
ceding section) will be your best friends now.
Race routes are often closed to cyclists very early by Tour security
forces. When they say no, listen up — they mean it and won’t hesi-
tate to use force if you challenge them by continuing on your bike.
Get off your bike and start pushing. It’s a good idea to stick an extra
pair of walking shoes in your daypack for unexpected hikes like this.
Lodging details
Another major detail is lodging — where, what kind, what price? Do
you want to stay in hotels or motels, in hostels, in private homes, or
campgrounds? Do you want to be as close as possible to the race
start or finish or close to a viewing location that you have selected?
What is your price range? How particular are you about your accom-
modations? (You get what you pay for in terms of lodging in France.
Most reservations staff speak English in major motel chains.)
Hotels like Novotel, Sofitel, and Ibis are usually reliable choices for
lodging. Hilton, Hyatt, Holiday Inn, Marriott, Best Western, and
Choice Hotels International also have locations in France that are
familiar to Americans. Most of these hotels are located along the
Autoroute and are easy to find, and some of these places offer wi-fi
or high-speed Internet access. You can make your reservations
online for all these lodging choices.
Part IV: Watching the Race 
158

You have many options for making reservations for lodging, but
your best bets are via telephone or the Web. You can always start
with a motel chain (for example, www.novotel.com). or you can
use online sites like Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Travelocity (www.
travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), and Yahoo!
Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com). You may want to first check out
an online lodging information site such as About.com (http://
gofrance.about.com/od/lodging) or Lonely Planet (www.
lonelyplanet.com). Frommer’s is also a great place to start (www.
frommers.com). Or perhaps you just want to kick back and have a
travel agent do all the planning and make reservations for you. 
Camping is a popular choice for cycling fans during the Tour de
France. Campgrounds are plentiful, but they’re usually packed full
along the routes. You can try camping along roads, in front yards,
anywhere you can find — anything goes during the Tour. But asking
permission from the owner is always a good idea.

Finding more information
For more transportation and lodging info, check out the following:
Transportation: Many options are available for renting or leasing vehicles. Here is
a short list of rental agencies:
 Auto Europe (rent, lease, buy back Peugeot or rent motor homes): www.
autoeurope.com
 Renault EuroDrive (rent, lease, or buy back Renault): www.renaultusa.com
 Europecar (rent or lease): www.europecar.com
 Avis Car-Away (rent motor homes): www.aviscaraway.com
American auto rental companies also rent vehicles in France. Check online for rates
and availability with Alamo, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, National, and Thrifty.
Lodging: Check online for the major American hotel chains that provide lodging in
France. Many of the larger hotel groups can be found in France. English is spoken
and be sure to call if you’re arriving late.
Accor Hotels (www.accor.com) gives you many French hotel and motel options
for reservations: Sofitel, Novotel, Mercure, Ibis, Etap, Red Roof Inns, and Formula 1
are all part of the Accor group. Tour de France teams stay in many of these hotels,
so you may see team trucks and cars in the parking lots, and plenty of riders coming
through the doors.

People set up campsites anywhere, but be aware that folks who are
there first can be territorial. Be sure to ask whether they mind if you
set up near them, and it’s a good idea to make friends and allies so
you can jointly protect your viewing spot.
Camping usually means partying — loud, boisterous drinking and
partying into the wee hours for many folks. If you have a problem
with noise or midnight revelry, perhaps camping won’t work for
you. It’s difficult to find an isolated camping spot anywhere near
a good viewing location, especially in the mountains.
Hostels are numerous in France, and if a Tour route goes near a
hostel, you have an inexpensive option for lodging. Most rooms
are shared, with two to four beds in a room, but some hostels have
family rooms available. Check with Hostelling International at www.
hiayh.org for international locations and membership information.
Other lodging options include bed and breakfast lodging or renting
an apartment or villa. If you’re staying in one location and want to
spend time in a town or village, you can check out the official Gîtes
de France Web site at www.gites-de-france.fr for lodging
options. Note that you can view this Web site in English.
Where to Watch
Deciding where to watch each stage is a big deal, because it also
impacts where you’ll stay and how far you’ll travel in a day.
Everyone has his or her opinion about the most exciting viewing
location. Seeing the race start, watching riders along the way, or
being at the finish (as in Figure 11-2) — what’s your ideal spot?
How about what many cycling fans consider the ultimate spot —
in the mountains?
Checking out the Village Départ
The Village Départ (vee-laj day-par) is the morning mecca for spon-
sors, celebrities, media, and select honored Tour guests. It’s the
place to be seen and to be a part of the in-crowd. Situated close to
the start line, the Village is enclosed with a 7-foot-high wire fence.
Unrelenting Tour Security Guards check every person who walks
through. No credentials, no entry, no exceptions.
Part IV: Watching the Race 
160

Figure 11-2: Crowds starting to arrive at the finish on La Mongie.
You may enter the Village only if you have proper credentials. VIP
or sponsor guests have a certain color wristband that must be
worn tightly enough to not allow it to be slipped off and handed
through the fence to someone else. Other folks, like Tour staff
members and Press, have credentials with a photo, worn around
their necks on a lanyard.
Appearing like magic every morning near the start line, the Village
is located in an adjacent field or park (see Figure 11-3). If there are
statues and water fountains, all the better for some semblance of
elegant ambiance. This one-day village usually covers an area
about the size of a football field, but size varies depending on the
town or village that’s hosting the Tour start festivities.
In reality, parts and pieces of pointy-top white tents and the fenc-
ing are trucked in and assembled during wee hours. Construction
may not be a miracle, but it’s a well-planned daily project assem-
bled like pieces of a Lego game. Tents, tables, chairs, banners, elec-
trical equipment, cooking equipment, telephone, Internet access, a
mini beauty salon, a Tour merchandise boutique, a news stand, a
coffee shop, and a bar (yes, a bar in the morning) all pop up and
are mobbed when the gates open. Food, freebies, and schmoozing
are magnets for the rich and famous, and particularly for mooching
media. Local specialties are cooked on-site for the hungry celebs.
Chapter 11: Going to the Tour: A Brief Guide 161

Figure 11-3: The reception area of the Village Départ in Châteaubriant.
Imagine a few thousand very important, hungry people having to
line up and individually show their access passes. It’s quite the
mob scene, and cutting in or crowding in front of other folks is the
norm. Even celebs try to sneak in or bluff their way in. Tour secu-
rity officers have seen and heard it all before. Nice try, but no dice.
Starts and finishes
Do you want to head out early to watch the teams arriving for the
stage start? Seeing a cavalcade of buses and team cars laden with
bicycles, waving to riders on the bus, and watching cycling heroes
come down bus steps to fiddle with their bikes is a treat. You may
be able to see your favorites warming up, and they may pass within
arm’s reach on their way to signing in.
Very often, though, the team area is off limits to crowds, so you may
be standing behind fences and viewing from a distance. Other times,
fans are only a few feet away. A few lucky people may get autographs
when they’re in the right place at the right time. Hearing the crowd
roar when they see Lance Armstrong or Jan Ullrich can be worth
being jammed in crowds so thick you can hardly move.
Do you want to arrive early and try to grab a spot right near the
start line? An area immediately near the start is barricaded off for
guests, sponsors, and press. But hanging on the fence as the huge
peloton (main pack of riders) and hundreds of vehicles head down
the course is thrilling. Riders in the peloton start slowly, so you
may be able to spot your favorite rider in the melee.
Part IV: Watching the Race 
162

If you want a good spot at the start line, allow traveling time to
arrive about three hours before the start time. Parking is always a
time-consuming nightmare. Be prepared to sit in traffic jams and
walk a long way to the start line area.
You need to immediately grab your spot along the start line fence
and not leave, or someone will instantly take over your place. If
you head over to the team area to see the teams arrive without
leaving someone to hold your spot, you’ll likely end up standing
behind a huge number of people when you return.
Maybe you want to catch a glimpse of the race passing by from a
small village with some sharp turns on the route. You can then run
into a nearby cafe or bar to view the remainder of the race. Shop
owners are used to being jam-packed with Tour viewers and are
pretty mellow about customers sitting for a long time at tables.
Buy some food, snacks, or a Coca (Coke) to drink fairly often while
you’re taking up space. Cokes are expensive — maybe 3 euros,
with no ice. But hey, you’re watching the Tour courtesy of the
owner’s television.
Getting to the finish, or Arriveé, has the same logistics as getting to
the start. Leave hours early and allow time to get through traffic
jams, park, and make your way through the crowds early enough
to find a choice spot. Time trial finishes, sprint finishes, and moun-
tain finishes are so popular that folks take up their viewing spots
hours — or even days — before race day.
The same rule applies to the finish line viewing as to watching
starts — stay in your spot or someone will take it over. Even if you
don’t move, someone may elbow right in front of you, so you’ll
have to be assertive to stand your ground.
Some shop owners put televisions in their windows, so fans can
stand on the sidewalk and watch. Folks in smaller villages will put
a television on their windowsill to share the race with passersby.
Chasing the Tour is a bonding experience, and the French love to
share their Tour stories.
Partying and painting 
in the mountains
The ultimate viewing spot for many cycling fans is in the moun-
tains. Spectators in recreation vehicles or who’ve been camping
arrive three or four days early to grab choice spots on the slow,
steep, elbow turns. Fans of certain teams stake out large territo-
ries, and woe be to anyone who tries to move in on their spots. For
example, turn 7 on L’Alpe d’Huez is known as the Dutch corner.
Chapter 11: Going to the Tour: A Brief Guide 163

If you want a viewing spot near the top, you need to drive up at
least one night before, squeeze into a parking spot, and spend a
cold night camping or sleeping in your car. But remember, it’s usu-
ally an all-night party in most areas.
If you’re arriving the morning of the mountain stage, you’ll find
roads closed hours early by Tour security. Only hikers or cyclists
are allowed, so you may need to hike long distances to the best
spots. Leave early — hours and hours early — park at the bottom,
and start walking. Be sure to take clothing for all kinds of weather,
plus sunscreen, rain gear, snacks, and plenty of water.
Tour de France mountain stages, whether Alps or Pyrenees, are a
combination of Mardi Gras and mayhem. Huge national flags and
signs, urging favorite riders to victory, float in the wind. Large
groups of fans wearing orange, pink, or polka-dot T-shirts gather by
team color along the roadside. Loud and proud is the name of the
game for cycling fans.
Alcohol use is endemic to mountain stages — kids drinking wine is
not an unusual site. Killing time by partying and boozing is par for
the course, and by the time the race arrives, the crowds can be
rowdy.
Painting the roads on the route, especially mountain stages, is a
Tour tradition. One can see the history of the Tour by old, faded
names on the pavement. Names, slogans, and epithets are painted
on the roads, covering the pavement in some cases. Fans work dili-
gently the day before with paint cans and brushes in hand. If
you’re painting, beware: Paint that doesn’t dry can be a slippery
danger to racers. And if you want your sign televised, keep it
appropriate.
Surviving sleepovers and takeovers
Staking out your claim to a small piece of viewing real estate in the
mountains can be tricky. You have this great spot, but when you
wake up in the morning, someone has quietly moved in, right in
front of you. Even worse, they are holding the spot for a huge group
of other fans. What happens? Unless you’ve made an alliance with
other neighbors, you either fight ’em or join ’em, usually the latter.
The Devil and other weird characters
You’ll see folks in all varieties of dress and undress at the Tour.
Men mooning their backsides and women flashing their breasts,
Basque men dressed as busty women, people dressed as giant
Stetson hats, guys carrying an inflated whale, cyclists wearing
stuffed kiwis on their helmets, people in polka-dot outfits riding
Part IV: Watching the Race 
164

polka-dot painted horses, women slowly cycling by in halter tops
and thongs. You’ll see it all at the circus mountain stages of the
Tour de France.
Probably the best known and most pungent character is Didi Senft,
best known as the Devil, and he jumps around beside the riders in
any area that’s likely to be covered by television cameras or print
photographers. Senft has appeared every year since 1993. He has
sponsors, wears a devil outfit, and carries an oversize pitchfork.
And an oversized bike that is about 15 feet high — and rideable!
He’s popular with fans, but most riders avoid him.
Early bird gets the front row
Sleeping late will not get you a good view of the race, unless you’ve
found a room overlooking the race course. Waking up and leaving
early is what you do to get great views of the action. For example,
watching the final stage on the Champs Élysées means heading to
the course very early. Racers don’t arrive until late afternoon, but
most fans are holding their spot before 9:00 in the morning.
Getting photos and autographs
The most sought-after signature in recent Tours is Lance
Armstrong’s. He’s mobbed the minute he walks out of the team bus
(see Figure 11-4). He can’t possibly accommodate every request,
though, so only the lucky few receive that prized autograph.
Figure 11-4: Autograph seekers swarm the U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team
bus in Wasquehal.
Chapter 11: Going to the Tour: A Brief Guide 165

Other riders may be more accessible, but the best time to ask for
autographs is at race start. Riders are fresh, relaxed, and rested —
they are more likely to stop and give autographs on their way to or
from the sign-in. But not many riders stop to pose for pictures —
it takes too long and they get bombarded with too many other
requests.
Many fans besiege the riders at the finish line, but that’s really bad
timing. Riders are exhausted, hungry, dirty, and sometimes injured.
They may ignore fans, who may get hurt or angry at perceived
rejection. But think about the hardest work day you’ve ever had —
would you want to stop for autographs or photos on your way to
shower, dinner, and rest?
Grabbing that bidon (water bottle)
Team water bottles are prized possessions, and fans scramble for
ones thrown by riders. Because bottles are thrown randomly, it’s
mostly a question of being in the right place at the right time.
Fans often line up at feed zones, hoping to grab a discarded
musette (food bag) or water bottle. In rare instances, a rider will
reward a cheering fan with a bottle tossed right into his or her
hands. The chance of getting a bottle signed is pretty slim, but
what a souvenir if you do!
The Thrill of Finishing 
on the Champs Élysées
Even racers admit they always get a thrill from riding on this vener-
able final stage of the Tour de France. Starting at the Place de la
Concorde, with the Arc de Triomphe towering at the far end, the
peloton (main group of riders) thunders around its final laps — see
Figure 11-5. The speed of the peloton is amazing. Racers and vehi-
cles are a blur; a kaleidoscope of colors.
Racing on the Champs Élysées is tougher than it appears. The
street is rough and cobbled, and it’s steeper than it looks. Given
the surface and the speed, the yellow jersey contender runs the
risk of falling and losing his Tour victory during the last stage. The
excitement builds with each lap, ending with a sprint finish. 
The crowd roars so loudly that racers can’t hear. The intensity is
unbelievable: the peloton, team cars, official cars, and motorcycles
flashing up one side of the Champs Élysées and back down the
Part IV: Watching the Race 
166

other side for eight laps. These sounds and sights bring fans back
year after year to the Champs Élysées for the legendary Tour finale.
Figure 11-5: L’Arc de Triomphe at the top end of the Champs Élysées in Paris.
What you don’t see on television
Crowds are packed 12 deep around the final kilometers of the
course (see Figure 11-6), which is why fans in the know bring
stepladders to stand above crowds. Fans are vying for spots where
they can see the final laps on the billboard-sized television screen.
Everyone is trying to figure out how to sneak into the restricted
areas for a better view. Tour security guards are checking passes
and throwing people out of these restricted areas.
Vendors are everywhere, selling everything from cigarette lighters
to Tour Eiffel scarves to umbrellas to earrings. The Official Tour de
France boutiques are swamped with hordes of people buying any-
thing Tour de France.
Where the elite meet and greet
Along the prime area of the finish line, Tour sponsors offer hospi-
tality areas. These grandstand seats are off-limits for anyone who
doesn’t have a sponsor pass. Sponsor guests are given royalty
treatment and seating for prime viewing. Sponsor hospitality areas
take up grandstand seating from the lower end of the Champs
Élysées to way past the finish line.
Chapter 11: Going to the Tour: A Brief Guide 167

Figure 11-6: Crowds milling around on the Champs Élysées.
Standing on the balcony of the Hôtel de Crillion is an elite viewing
area for a few select visitors. Lance Armstrong stays in the Crillion,
so it’s a prime and coveted area. The Hôtel de Crillion flies the flag
of Texas to honor Armstrong (see Figure 11-7).

Tour security guards
Amaury Sports Organization (ASO), the organization that’s respon-
sible for putting on the Tour each year, has an expert team of secu-
rity guards who return every year. They are efficient and relentless
about keeping people without credentials or passes out of
restricted areas. It’s almost impossible to fool one of these guys
into believing that you belong where you don’t. They’re profes-
sional and courteous, but when they say no, you’d better go.
Hordes of ecstatic spectators
Estimates of a million spectators pouring into Paris for the finish of
the Tour de France seem true when you’re trying to push your way
through shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. The excitement is contagious,
and the event provides the thrill of a lifetime for cycling fans. It’s def-
initely worth standing in your viewing spot for hours to experience
this event. If you’re somehow lucky enough, or early enough, to see
the podium ceremonies (see Figure 11-8), you’ll have the ultimate
Tour de France experience.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
L
ike all For Dummies books, this one ends with a Part
of Tens that provides lists of ten unique things about
the Tour de France. You ﬁnd our choices for the best Tour
riders, the Tours that have had the most impact on the
cycling world, ten unique statistics from the race’s more
than 100-year legacy, the most dramatic moments in the
Tour’s history, the most well known mountains and
climbs, and ten other important cycling events.

Chapter 12
Ten Greatest Riders 
in Tour History
In This Chapter
 Looking at the best riders in Tour history
 Reviewing various champions throughout time
E
quipment changes, weather changes, course changes, and
strategy changes — all are part of the Tour de France. Great
Tour champions all have different styles, too. But through the
race’s more than 100-year history, the best cyclists have all been
the same in some respects. They’ve had great individual skills and
one intangible quality — a focused desire to win.
This chapter, in alphabetical order, acknowledges the ten cyclists
we’ve chosen as the finest in Tour de France history. Five riders
are easy choices, because they dominated the event during their
past or current tenures. Lance Armstrong has a record six consecu-
tive Tour titles as of the writing of this book. Jacques Anquetil and
Bernard Hinault (both Frenchmen), Eddy Merckx of Belgium, and
Spaniard Miguel Indurain all captured the race five times.
Great champions like Gino Bartali, Fausto Coppi, Greg LeMond, Jan
Ullrich, and Joop Zoetemelk are listed for diverse reasons —
longevity, perseverance, and their ability to overcome personal
tragedy. Plenty of other great bicyclists competed in the Tour, but
here’s our list of the ten finest.
Jacques Anquetil
Contrary to the regimented training of many champions, Jacques
Anquetil became the Tour’s first five-time winner with a unique,
playboy lifestyle, a profound swagger, and tremendous skill as a
time trialist. Raised in the country, Anquetil’s career curiously

involved number 17. He won the Grand Prix des Nations, and then
the unofficial time trial world championship, at age 17, and he
raced for 17 years.
Anquetil claimed his first Tour title in 1957 with nearly a 15-minute
victory over Marc Janssens of Belgium. Anquetil celebrated his
notoriety with as much vigor as he rode. He led a party lifestyle
and fit the part of a southern California surfer: Anquetil had blond
hair and blue eyes and often drove a sports car to races. Anquetil
was infamous for smoking and drinking, and he uttered among the
most often cited quotes in Tour history: “You can’t ride the Tour
de France on mineral water.”
Four years elapsed before Anquetil claimed his second Tour in
1961, and he then won three more consecutive titles. Following his
cycling retirement, Anquetil was in poor health for many years and
died of stomach cancer in 1987.
Lance Armstrong
Brash and explosively talented, Lance Armstrong was age 21 in
1993 when he became the youngest cyclist to win the World
Championship road race. But youthful confidence doesn’t always
mean much in the Tour de France.
Armstrong completed the event only once in his first four
attempts, a 36th place overall finish in 1995. It was the same year
his Italian friend and teammate Fabio Casartelli died during the
race following a tragic hillside crash.
Armstrong’s two-year absence from the Tour following his 1996
race abandonment was largely spent in recovery from his well-
documented battle against testicular cancer. Armstrong returned
to the Tour in 1999 more than 20 pounds lighter, and he began his
still-in-progress race domination.
Much to the surprise of the French media, Armstrong won the
Prologue. He also captured three more stages en route to the first
of his six Tour titles, with more than a 71⁄2-minute margin over Alex
Zulle of Switzerland.
During his record-setting 2004 Tour victory, Armstrong won three
mountains stages and both individual time trials en route to a
nearly 61⁄2-minute win over Germany’s Andreas Kloden.
Armstrong is a dominating individual rider, a masterful tactician,
and a consummate team rider. Many of Armstrong’s stage wins
Part V: The Part of Tens 
174

have occurred in epic battles against the sport’s finest, including
German Jan Ullrich, the 1997 race winner, and deceased 1998 race
titlist Marco Pantani of Italy. Armstrong has withstood numerous
crashes. He has also spoken out in response to numerous drug
accusations.
Gino Bartali
Many Tour de France riders’ careers are fleeting. An ill-timed, split-
second decision has stopped more than one cyclist’s career. But
not even WWII stopped Gino Bartali of Italy.
After winning his first title in 1938 — the first year individual riders
weren’t allowed to race (that is, they had to be part of a team) —
Bartali returned a decade later and won again. While his doomsay-
ers thought the 34-year-old was too old, Bartali’s fans remembered
his dominating pre-war mountain performances.
Bartali logged huge chunks of training miles and was devoutly reli-
gious. He didn’t get along well with his equally famous country-
man, Fausto Coppi. In fact, the two argued as the 1948 race
approached and, in disgust, Coppi refused to participate.
Bartali remained unfazed. He attacked early and won the first stage
in 1948, but faltered the next day. At the end of the first week,
Bartali trailed Frenchman Louison Bobet by more than 20 minutes
in the General Classification. When the race entered the Pyrenees,
Bartali responded, knowing the seventh stage ended in the faithful
city of Lourdes. He claimed the stage, won two more stages in suc-
cession, then crushed the field in the Alps.
Bartali eventually won seven Tour stages in 1948. With descending
skills as strong as his climbing abilities, he claimed more than a 16-
minute win over Belgium’s Brik Schotte. Bartali’s second Tour win
placed him in a one-member fraternity. He’s the only Tour rider to
win overall titles a decade apart. Bartali also finished the Tour in
second (1949), fourth (1951 and 1952), and 11th (1953), and he
completed his Tour career with 12 stage wins.
Fausto Coppi
Gino Bartali entered the 1949 Tour as defending champion. He and
Fausto Coppi reconciled, and the two Italians were ready for a
much-anticipated battle. Coppi had already won the Tour of 
Italy three times, but at age 29 — six years younger than his 
compatriot — he was ready to claim his first Tour.
Chapter 12: Ten Greatest Riders in Tour History 175

The two Italians often rode near each other in the second week in
the Pyrenees. When the race entered the Alps, Coppi showed his
still-youthful strength. He left Bartali as the race arrived in Italy
and claimed a mountain stage and time trial en route to an 11-
minute overall win over his aging countryman.
Swiss riders Ferdi Kubler and Hugo Koblet, respectively, won the
1950 and 1951 Tours. Coppi returned in 1952 after overcoming two
sub-par racing years and the 1951 death of his brother during a
road race. Coppi, 33, was in superior shape, and he won his second
Tour by nearly 30 minutes over Belgian Constant Ockers. Coppi
won five Tour stages in 1952, including the inaugural ascent of
L’Alpe d’Huez, the event’s most famous climb.
Coppi participated in the Tour only three times. His career was
interrupted by war, numerous injuries, family tragedy, and his
feisty temper. He won nine Tour stages, but when he left the sport,
his life crumbled. Coppi divorced his wife for a girlfriend, a scandal
that shocked Italy at that time. Coppi’s untimely death at age 40
from Malaria only further added to his legend.
Bernard Hinault
Like Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil, and Eddy Merckx, Bernard
Hinault — the last French rider to win the Tour — made a stunning
debut in the controversial 1978 race. Riders felt the route was too
difficult, and they dismounted their bikes at the end of one morn-
ing stage to protest.
Michel Pollentier of Belgium won the stage to L’Alpe d’Huez and
claimed the yellow jersey. But Pollentier was quickly disqualified
from the race. During the post-stage drug test, he was caught using
a contraption that held fake urine.
That’s when Hinault capitalized on Pollentier’s departure. He won
three stages in his race debut, including two time trials. He claimed
his first title by nearly four minutes over Dutchman Joop
Zoetemelk. With a defending French titlist, the host country was
overjoyed. Hinault won in dominating fashion in 1979, claiming
seven stages and further displayed his determined, sometimes
harsh nature. His demeanor and gritty facial expressions earned
him the nickname “The Badger.”
Hinault’s only weakness was tendonitis. Suffering from severe knee
pain, he abandoned the 1980 race as it entered the Pyrenees.
Hinault won again in 1981 and 1982, but he missed the 1983 race
Part V: The Part of Tens 
176

when his tendonitis returned. Hinault was determined, and after
finishing second to compatriot Laurent Fignon in 1984, he claimed
his fifth title in 1985. American Greg LeMond was Hinault’s team-
mate and appeared in position to outshine the French star. Hinault
was weakened by crashes, but Hinault hired LeMond as a support
rider, not a race winner. LeMond was upset, but he relented.
Hinault, who wore the yellow jersey for 78 days in his career, con-
cluded his Tour efforts in 1986 when he finished second to
LeMond.
Hinault had 28 stage wins in eight Tour appearances, and he is now
part of the Tour organization and greets podium finishers after
every stage.
Miguel Indurain
Greg LeMond was favored as defending titlist in the 1991 Tour.
Former race winners Pedro Delgado of Spain, Laurent Fignon of
France, and Ireland’s Stephen Roche were also in the field. The sur-
prising rider was Miguel Indurain of Spain. Indurain had finished
10th in 1990, the highest finish of his first six Tour attempts that
included three abandonments.
Indurain was considered a good team rider, but no one predicted
his early mountain attacks, strategic defensive riding, and final
time trial dominance. A cyclist of little bravado and few words,
Indurain won the first of his then-record five straight titles with a
31⁄2-minute victory over Italy’s Gianni Bugno. LeMond placed sev-
enth that year in his last Tour finish.
For the next four years, Indurain dominated the Tour, all with little
fanfare, little controversy, and no boastful predictions. Indurain
respected his rivals and was respected by fans. He smiled often
and remained quiet and powerful. Indurain never won more than
two stages in any of his Tour titles, and he never won a mountain
stage during his five titles, but after his initial race title, Indurain’s
overall margin of victory was never less than 41⁄2 minutes.
Indurain sought a sixth straight Tour title, but his triumphant years
ended abruptly in 1996. Indurain suffered in the Alps, and his con-
trolled, rarely changing smile was suddenly replaced by a look of
someone in panic. Indurain lost more than three minutes in the
stage and eventually finished 11th overall in his final Tour attempt.
Indurain’s career included 12 stage wins in 12 Tour participations.
He wore the yellow jersey for 60 days, fourth most in race history
behind Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Lance Armstrong.
Chapter 12: Ten Greatest Riders in Tour History 177

Greg LeMond
Unlike Indurain and other Tour champions, Greg LeMond, the first
of only two American race winners, showed his potential early. He
finished third in the 1984 Tour and second overall in 1985 to his
aging and injured team leader, Bernard Hinault.
In 1986, LeMond made history as the first American to win the
Tour. With Hinault concluding his career, LeMond finally got his
time in the Tour spotlight. He captured his second career win in
Stage 13 and took the yellow jersey in Stage 17. By the end of the
race, LeMond claimed the first of his three titles by more than 3
minutes over Hinault, his valiant and defiant teammate.
Like Lance Armstrong, LeMond’s career was interrupted by life
tragedy. On a 1987 hunting trip in northern California, LeMond was
accidentally shot by his brother in law and suffered near-fatal
wounds. While recovering, LeMond missed the 1987 and 1988 Tours.
He triumphantly returned and took his second Tour title in 1989.
Always personable, LeMond won three stages during his second
title year. His final-day time trial win and eight-second race margin
over Laurent Fignon was the closest race finish in history. It’s often
considered the Tour’s finest moment.
LeMond’s gunshot recovery and his 1989 final-day dramatics bol-
stered the sport’s popularity in the United States. LeMond
uniquely captured his third and final title by 2 minutes 16 seconds
over Italian Claudio Chiappucci of Italy in 1990. LeMond didn’t win
a stage, providing ideal proof the Tour is a race of three-week strat-
egy, not single-day wins.
Like other champions, LeMond’s Tour reign ended abruptly. He
was favored in 1991, but LeMond began to suffer suddenly while
approaching the summit of the Tourmalet in the Alps and finished
seventh. LeMond withdrew in his final two Tour attempts, in 1992
and 1994. Besides his three titles, LeMond concluded his Tour
career with five stage wins in eight Tour appearances.
Eddy Merckx
More than any other cyclist, Eddy Merckx had an uncanny ability
to intimidate competitors. The Belgian cyclist is considered by
many to be the finest rider in history. When he appeared at a race
start, the rest of the field often knew it was riding for no higher
than second place.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
178

Merckx made his Tour debut in 1969 and predicted he would win,
but about a month before the Tour, he tested positive for ampheta-
mines during the Tour of Italy and was expelled from the race.
Merckx protested vehemently, and after not competing for 18 days,
he was cleared of charges based on “flawed test procedures.” He
kept his promise to win, despite the inauspicious pre-race publicity.
Merckx rode unchallenged en route to the finest debut in Tour his-
tory. He claimed six stages, plus the best climber and points com-
petitions, and won by nearly 18 minutes over Roger Pingeon of
France, the 1967 titlist.
Merckx was nicknamed The Cannibal for the way he “ate up” miles
and “devoured the competition.” Throughout his Tour career,
Merckx’s moniker was rarely inappropriate. He claimed eight Tour
stage wins in 1970 and 1974 (the record for stage wins in a single
year), six stages in 1969 and 1972, and four stages in 1971.
Like Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil, and Miguel Indurain,
Merckx valiantly tried to claim a sixth title, but he failed. His vic-
tory over Raymond Poulidor of France by 8 minutes 4 seconds in
1974 was his smallest overall margin of victory. In 1975, race
observers said Merckx wasn’t at his best as the Tour began.
Several other contenders emerged in the mountains, but Merckx
persevered, only to succumb to a fan’s antics: While grinding his
way toward a mountainous stage finish, a fan jumped into the road
and punched Merckx in the lower back about a half-mile from the
line.
Merckx stumbled across the finish, vomiting. The incident marked
the beginning of the end of Merckx’s career. He won two stages of
the 1975 Tour, but finished second overall to Bernard Thevenet of
France by 2 minutes and 47 seconds. Merckx didn’t compete in the
1976 Tour and finished sixth overall in 1977. He completed an
unequaled Tour career. In seven Tour appearances, Merckx
claimed 34 stages and wore the yellow jersey for 96 days — both
race records.
Jan Ullrich
Following the retirement of Miguel Indurain, the Tour was ripe for a
new champion. Bjarne Riis of Denmark was the surprise 1996
winner. But lurking in his near shadow was a young German team-
mate named Jan Ullrich.
Chapter 12: Ten Greatest Riders in Tour History 179

Ullrich was nearly born a cyclist. He learned the sport from a
young age in regimented East German training camps. By age 22,
he advanced through the ranks and claimed his first Tour stage
and finished second overall in 1996. The following year, with
defending champion Bjarne Riis faltering, Ullrich rode to his first
and only Tour title, claiming a mountain stage, a time trial, and the
first Tour title for Germany.
As defending champion in 1998, Ullrich began one of the Tour’s
unique wonderments. After struggling to lose weight in the winter
months following his Tour triumphant, Ullrich won three stages.
But he couldn’t overcome the skills of one of the event’s great pure
climbers, Marco Pantani of Italy, who prevailed over Ullrich by 3
minutes 21 seconds. Nearly every year, Ullrich works his way into
shape as the Tour progresses. He’s usually at his strongest in the
final week after overcoming his life’s pleasure and obstacle — he
loves to eat.
Ullrich missed the 1999 event because of injury, but he returned to
finish second to Lance Armstrong in 2000, 2001, and 2003. In each
of those years, Armstrong predicted Ullrich would be his primary
competitor and in each year, it was true. Ullrich, still racing in his
prime, is a superior climber and time trialist, and he’s often consid-
ered the most talented rider in the peloton (pack of riders). His bat-
tles with weight and less-than-superior team support have proven
costly. In seven Tour years, Ullrich has seven stage wins, seven
race finishes, and five second-place overall place finishes, with a
career-lowest fourth overall in 2004.
Joop Zoetemelk
After nine Tour finishes, including five second-place campaigns,
Dutchman Joop Zoetemelk captured his only Tour overall title in
1980 with a 6 minutes 55 seconds margin over countryman Hennie
Kuiper.
Zoetemelk was a strong time trialist and climber. But his ascension
to the top of the Tour podium occurred after unusual circum-
stances. Zoetemelk won three stages in 1980, but Bernard Hinault
withdrew while in the lead and with the race just reaching the
mountains.
A prideful rider, Zoetemelk refused to wear the yellow jersey via
default. But his fifth-place finish in the first mountain stage moved
him into the race lead, and he wore the yellow jersey to the finish.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
180

Zoetemelk finished second overall again in 1982 — his sixth
runner-up finish — and he continued competing in the event
through 1986. Zoetemelk finished all of his 16 Tour de France
attempts — the most in race history — and claimed ten stages to
complete the most enduring career in Tour history.

E
ach Tour edition has its own feel. Riders pedal along country
roads for hours in strong winds, heavy rain, snow, and bright
sunshine — sometimes all on the same day. The landscape, stand-
ings, and mood of the peloton (the main pack of riders) can remain
unchanged for days. But in an instant, it can all change. Crashes,
injuries, illness, a young rider’s surprising attack, or a veteran
cyclist’s sudden failure all make the Tour unique every year.
Two World Wars interrupted the Tour, but since the event’s incep-
tion, 91 Tours have been held in 102 years. Choosing the ten most
important Tour editions is subjective. Just like in the Super Bowl,
NBA Championship, Winston Cup, Stanley Cup, or World Series,
cycling fans have favorite Tours for different reasons.
From great individual performances to hot technology, from race
innovation to personal triumph, this chapter details our selection
of the ten most important Tour editions.
1903: Publishing Wars 
and Garin Make History
Henri Desgrange was a newspaperman, marketing whiz, and
cyclist, and he was competitive. Combining his various talents,
Desgrange, publisher of L’Auto, and his colleague Geo Lefevre

devised a bicycle race around France. The idea was for L’Auto to
outdo its rival Le Petit Journal, the newspaper that promoted a
vastly popular French cycling event, Paris-Brest-Paris.
Six-day track cycling events were popular at the time, so promot-
ers of the new event staged a six-segment race around France. The
idea wasn’t well accepted at first, but entry fees were lowered,
prize money was increased, and 60 cyclists were at the starting line
for the first stage.
Maurice Garin, a native of Italy who became a naturalized French
citizen in 1901, was favored. Stages were monumental, and Garin
was victorious in the 467-kilometer (290-mile) inaugural day from
Paris to Lyon in nearly 18 hours. Exhaustion took its toll, however.
Only 21 cyclists completed the 2,428-kilometer (1,506-mile) journey
(see Figure 13-1). Garin claimed the fifth and concluding sixth stage
and defeated runner-up countryman Lucien Pothier by 2 hours and
47 minutes.
Figure 13-1: Map of 1903 Tour route.
Desgrange’s plan worked perfectly. Circulation of L’Auto, published
on yellow newsprint, doubled during the race, and Le Petit Journal
eventually folded. The Tour de France was born.

1913: Time Changes, 
Tour Reverses
Throughout its tenure, Tour organizers have kept the race fresh.
New routes, new jerseys, and the addition of time bonuses have
enticed cyclists and kept race fans interested. So, it’s no surprise
that, a decade into the event, two monumental changes occurred.
 For the first time, the direction of the Tour route was reversed
(see Figure 13-2).
 More importantly, the race leader was determined via total
shortest accumulated time, not total points.
Figure 13-2: Map of 1913 Tour route.
Despite its constant innovation and growing popularity, the Tour
had detractors. In 1913 , saboteurs put nails and glass on the route
of the first stage, and 29 riders ended their journeys en route to the
finish at Le Havre.

The 1913 Tour was also significant because of cyclists’ ingenuity. In
one instance, Eugene Christophe, riding in the lead, shattered part
of his bike frame. Christophe carried his bike for two hours,
arrived at a local blacksmith’s shop, and spent an hour repairing
his bike. He persevered, but didn’t win the race.
Also that year, Belgian Marcel Buysse and Frenchman Lucien Petit-
Breton were in the hunt for overall victory, but both suffered flat
tires early in a stage to Geneva. Other race favorites seized the
moment and attempted to leave Buysse and Petit-Breton perma-
nently behind. Strategy prevailed. Buysse and Petit-Breton made
their repairs and caught the leaders by working together. Philippe
Thys of Belgium claimed the first of his three overall titles with
more than an 81⁄2-hour margin over Gustave Garrigou of France.
1919: The Yellow Jersey Debuts
World War I interrupted the Tour for four years, and the race
wasn’t the same when it returned. Former winners Lucien Petit-
Breton (1907), Francois Faber (1909), and Octave Lapize (1910)
were killed in battle. As the Tour start approached, many cyclists
were in poor shape, and many roads of France weren’t in great
shape, either (see the map of the Tour route in Figure 13-3). In the
end, only 11 of 69 starters finished.
But race organizer Henri Desgrange was insistent the race resume,
and he had a plan. To match the color of his newspaper, L’Auto,
Desgrange introduced a new marketing tool — the maillot jaune, or
yellow jersey.
At the point in the race when the jersey débuted, Eugene
Christophe hadn’t yet won a stage, but he took the maillot jaune
after assuming the race lead in the new jersey’s 10th stage debut.
Christophe was among the unluckiest cyclists in Tour history.
While leading the race, his bike frame broke (again!), and he lost
the race lead while walking to a local bicycle factory. Christophe
eventually placed third, 2 hours and 16 minutes behind Belgian
Firmin Lambot, who claimed the first of his two titles.

1938: Le Tour: A Team Sport
In 1938, only teams were allowed to enter the race on that year’s
route (see Figure 13-4); individuals were no longer allowed to par-
ticipate. If a cyclist didn’t make his national squad, groups of
cadets were grouped into B teams.
Gino Bartali of Italy captured the first of his two overall titles and
best climber jersey in 1938, the final Tour before World War II inter-
rupted the event for nearly a decade. The race also showcased
cycling sportsmanship at its finest. Frenchmen Andre Leducq and
Antonin Magne, both participating for the last time, pedaled away
from the peloton in the final stage and put their arms around each
other as they reached the finish. Race organizers called the final
stage a tie, and the two veteran cyclists ended their respective
careers with co-stage wins. Sylvere Maes of Belgium won the race
by 301⁄2-minutes over Rene Vietto of France.

1969: Eddy Merckx Arrives 
and Dominates
When he wasn’t winning, Eddy Merckx of Belgium was down in the
dumps. Given his druthers, Merckx set out to claim every race he
entered, including his Tour debut in 1969. Merckx wasn’t the
youngest rider to triumph at the Tour, nor was he the first boastful
pending champion. But at age 24, Merckx said he’d win the race in
his first attempt, and he did.
Like many great champions, Merckx had few weaknesses. He won
the Tour with superior climbing, with his excellent time trial skills,
and by intimidation. He attacked when he didn’t have to, and he
often left strategy as a concern for other cyclists.
Merckx’s Tour debut in 1969 (see Figure 13-5) was nothing short of
astonishing. He won the points and best climber competitions, six
stages, including three time trials, and he captured the overall title
by nearly 18 minutes over Roger Pingeon of France. The career of
the cyclist considered the greatest in history had just begun.

1986: Greg LeMond and Other
Americans in Paris
Greg LeMond should have won the 1985 Tour, but that year was
still teammate Bernard Hinault’s time as team leader. But after a
third place in 1984 and second place in 1985, LeMond continued
his career as one of the race’s great riders with the first of his three
titles.
Hinault didn’t give up easily. He attacked often, but LeMond even-
tually wore him down on mountains (see Figure 13-6), and Hinault
conceded by grabbing and raising LeMond’s hand into the air as
the two rode together in one late-race mountain stage. LeMond,
world road champion three years earlier, defeated Hinault by 3
minutes and 10 seconds, and the Tour was again transformed.

LeMond became cycling’s first million-dollar rider, the sport’s pop-
ularity grew substantially, and LeMond brought the Tour into the
collective U.S. consciousness. LeMond’s win was also part of a
bigger breakthrough year for U.S. cyclists in Europe. Team 7-
Eleven, primarily composed of Americans, became the first U.S.-
based team to participate. Davis Phinney, one of many U.S. pros
based in Colorado, became the second American to win a Tour
stage.
1989: LeMond Dramatically 
Wins Again
By 1989, the Tour had been held 75 times with countless dramatic
stages, but nothing had approached what happened on the final
day of the 76th Tour. Greg LeMond, two years removed from his
near-fatal accidental gunshot wound, assumed and lost the yellow
jersey twice. He trailed two-time French winner Laurent Fignon by
50 seconds entering the final stage, a 25-kilometer (151⁄2-mile) indi-
vidual time trial that finished on the Champs Élysées in Paris 
(see Figure 13-7).

LeMond, the second-to-last rider on the course, quickly narrowed
his deficit. Purposely avoiding hearing his split times or knowing
his overall status, LeMond crossed the line with an average speed
of 54.55 kilometers per hour (33.84 mph). All LeMond could do
then was wait. Fignon, the French hero and last cyclist on the
course, finished 58 seconds slower than LeMond. The American
leaped into the air, hugged his wife, and exalted for all of France to
hear and see. Fignon, devastated, collapsed near the finish line.
LeMond’s 8-second title margin remains the closest in race history,
and his final stage speed remains the fastest in Tour history.
LeMond also changed cycling forever in his dramatic final-day win.
He was also the first cyclist to use aerodynamic handlebars in com-
petition. The newfangled bars allowed him to race in a tucked posi-
tion, a strategy that has been used since.
1999: Armstrong Shocks the World
Lance Armstrong had two stage wins and finished the Tour once in
his first four attempts. But in 1999 (see the route in Figure 13-8), he
returned to the race after two years from his well-documented
recovery from cancer.

The French doubted Armstrong could participate, never mind con-
test the title. But when Armstrong claimed the Prologue over Alex
Zulle of Switzerland, skeptics were still not convinced; they
became more vocal. How could a cyclist return from near-fatal
cancer, look so drastically leaner, and win?
Armstrong answered his critics verbally and on the bike. He claimed
the 8th and 19th stages, completing a sweep of the race’s time trials.
He also won the 9th stage to Sestrieres, his first Tour road win in
four years. The U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team (now called the
Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team), particularly George Hincapie,
Tyler Hamilton, and Frankie Andreu, rode strongly and became
known as the Blue Train. (Because of its blue uniforms and strate-
gic close-grouped formation, the USPS team received the nickname
from L’Equipe, the French daily sports newspaper.)
Armstrong rode to more than a 71⁄2-minute win over Alex Zulle. The
French remained skeptical, but they were also embarrassed. For
the first time, a U.S. team won the team title and for the first time
in more than 70 years, a French rider failed to win a single stage.

2003: Armstrong and Ullrich
Pedal in Fast Company
With entry into the exclusive five-title fraternity at stake in 2003,
battles between Lance Armstrong and Jan Ullrich highlighted one
of the most riveting Tours in history. The pace was fast, and the
long-awaited celebration of the race’s 100th anniversary couldn’t
have progressed with any more excitement.
The Tour visited several original host cities amid huge celebra-
tions (see Figure 13-9). Armstrong overcame dehydration, several
crashes, and an unplanned brief ride through a mowed field of hay
to claim his closest overall victory.
Figure 13-9: Map of the 2003 Tour route.
Largely pushed by Ullrich and Kazakhstan’s Alexandre Vinokourov,
Armstrong was victorious over Ullrich by 1 minute and 1 second.
He became the Tour’s fifth five-time winner and joined Miguel
Indurain as the only riders to win five consecutive Tours. The
race’s average finishing speed of 40.94 kilometers per hour 
(25.39 mph) was the fastest in history.

American Tyler Hamilton, riding most of the race with a fractured

ished fourth overall.
2004: Armstrong Rides 
Into History
What many predicted would be Lance Armstrong’s hardest Tour
was his easiest. Eight years in recovery from the cancer that nearly
took his life, in 2004, Armstrong increased his Tour de France
career stage win total to 21 with five more stage victories.
At age 32, Armstrong used the strength of his team when required
and then rode off into the mountains, rarely challenged. In each of
his titles, Armstrong has had one surprisingly strong rider at his
side, and in 2004, that rider was Floyd Landis of San Diego,
California. Armstrong handpicked Landis to the surprise of many
onlookers as a Tour team member in 2002. Landis has finished
three straight Tours, including his 23rd place overall in 2004, when
he often joined Armstrong on steep mountains. The U.S. Postal
Service Cycling Team also claimed the team time trial.
Early in the race, Armstrong accused a French television crew of
entering his vacated hotel room. In other stages, Armstrong was
spit on, and he raced past derogatory handmade fans’ signs. But
Armstrong’s riding overshadowed any doomsayers. Armstrong
accumulated a 6-minute and 19-second margin over German
runner-up Andreas Kloden.
With his sixth title, Armstrong has accumulated a career-winning
margin of 35 minutes and has ridden approximately 13,100 miles in
127 days in his Tour titles. His 2004 triumph included a victory in
the Tour’s most anticipated stage, the uphill time trial to L’Alpe
d’Huez in which more than a half-million spectators lined the
course (see Figure 13-10). Armstrong also added drama with a rare
sprint triumph in Stage 17, the race’s longest and most difficult
day. Armstrong completed his 2004 title fifth among career stage
winners (21) and third (65) in career days in the yellow jersey,
behind Eddy Merckx (96) and Bernard Hinault (78).

Ten Unique Tour de France
Statistics
In This Chapter
 Aging and winning gracefully
 Pedaling for nationalistic pride
T
hroughout its long history, unique riders, epic stages, bizarre
occurrences, devastating crashes, heroic rides, and hard-to-
explain scandals, the Tour de France boils down to statistics.
Before, during, and after every stage, race organizers distribute
reams of information. From riders’ particulars to climbing gradi-
ents, accumulated kilometers to finishing time margins, the race is
a huge, all-encompassing calculator of people, places, and things.
After 100 years or so of adding it all up, even basic Tour statistics
are impressive. One example: In its 91 editions leading into the
2005 race, 53 different cyclists from 11 countries have won the
Tour.
This chapter looks at the Tour de France by numbers. How many
French riders have won? Who are the youngest and oldest riders to
claim victory? What are the fastest stage and fastest Tours, along
with the slowest stage and slowest Tours? What are the shortest
and longest Tours? Every kilometer, every attack, and every sprint
provides more statistics. But here’s our list of the ten most inter-
esting Tour statistics.
Young, Restless, and Champion
Frenchman Henri Cornet didn’t have the best ride among the 27
cyclists who finished the 1904 Tour. But Cornet, only age 20, had
the fastest legal time and became the race’s youngest winner.

Cornet finished three hours behind apparent winner and defending
title holder Maurice Garin. But Garin, his brother Caesar, and other
top finishers Lucien Pothier and Hippolyte Ancouturier were dis-
qualified for various rule infractions.
So, four months after the Tour ended, Cornet was declared the
winner in what for a while seemed like not only the second but last
Tour de France. Riders were ambushed and held hostage, and dis-
gruntled spectators threw nails on the course. Riders cheated, and
angry race director Henri Desgrange said the race would never be
held again.
Cornet didn’t know he was riding for the win, but he participated
with a champion’s spirit. He rode the final 35 kilometers (21.7
miles) with two flat tires.
While never again winning the Tour, Cornet nevertheless rode well.
He abandoned the Tour in 1905 and 1907, and he wasn’t able to
start in 1906. But he finished eighth overall in 1908 and concluded
his Tour career with a 28th place finish in 1912. Cornet died in 1941
with an enduring legacy — he was the youngest Tour de France
champion.
Old and Leading the Pack
Firmin Lambot participated in the Tour for almost a decade. He
first won the race in 1919 and claimed six career stages. But in
1922, Lambot’s nickname, “Lucky,” paid off with a career highlight
and two Tour milestones.
Lambot, 36, didn’t win any of the Tour’s 15 stages. But as he was
throughout his career, the Belgian rider was opportunistic. When
several race favorites faltered, Lambot assumed the race lead after
the 13th stage, and he cruised to more than a 41-minute race vic-
tory over France’s Jean Alavoine.
The 1922 event marked the introduction of climbs to Vars and
d’Izoard, two of the famous mountain ascents in the Alps. The 16th
Tour de France also provided the race with new dynamics. It was
the first time a rider won the overall title without claiming a stage,
and Lambot became the oldest race winner — a designation that
still remains.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
198

Will You Still Need Me 
When I’m 32?
Like many pro sports, the Tour is a young riders’ game. Only 12
riders age 32 and older have claimed overall titles. In chronological
order, they are:
 1903, Maurice Garin, age 32, France
 1919, Firmin Lambot, age 33, Belgium
 1921, Leon Scieur, age 33, Belgium
 1922, Firmin Lambot, age 36, Belgium
 1923, Henri Pelissier, age 34, France
 1926, Lucien Buysse, age 34, Belgium
 1929, Maurice Dewaele, age 33, Belgium
 1948, Gino Bartali, age 34, Italy
 1952, Fausto Coppi, age 33, Italy
 1980, Joop Zoetemelk, age 33, the Netherlands
 1996, Bjarne Riis, age 32, Denmark
 2004, Lance Armstrong, age 32, United States
Winning, French Style
Considering their lack of victories in the last 20 years, it doesn’t
seem feasible French riders have dominated the Tour de France
winner’s podium. But with 36 Tour titles, French cyclists have
claimed more than one-third of the overall titles. Belgium (18) has
the second most Tour winners, followed by Italy and the United
States, both with nine titles.
French titles have come in spurts. The first six editions (1903–
1908) were all claimed by French riders as well as in several other
time spans: 1930–1934, 1954–1957, 1961–1964, and 1981–1985.
As the race progresses every year, French cycling enthusiasts
would like nothing more than another compatriot’s victory. But a
Frenchman hasn’t won the Tour since Bernard Hinault’s fifth and
final title in 1985. Since Hinault’s last title, three French riders have
finished second: Hinault (1986), Laurent Fignon (1989), and
Richard Virenque (1997).

Taking the Long Way Home
There’s no such thing as an easy Tour de France. Some years have
been longer and easier; other years have been shorter and more
difficult. The 1926 Tour finally provided Belgian Lucien Buysse his
time at the top of the podium. After placing third in 1924 and
second in 1925, Buysse claimed the longest Tour in history. The
1926 race began in Evian, ended in Paris, and included 17 stages,
totaling 5,745 kilometers (3,569 miles). That’s an average of 209
miles per stage.
Buysse rode extremely well in the mountains and claimed the
second stage in the Pyrenees among his three stage wins.
Defending race titlist Ottavio Bottechecia, the first Italian winner,
was so discouraged when he had to abandon because of illness he
abruptly announced his retirement. Bottechecia competed in the
Tour four times, won twice, and captured nine stages. But he was
emotionally fragile, and shortly after he left the sport, Bottechecia
was found dead in an Italian vineyard. The cause of his death was
never determined.
It has been nearly 80 years, but Buysse’s more than 22-minute vic-
tory over Nicolas Franz of Luxembourg in the 20th Tour remains
the longest Tour on record. And none of today’s Tour stages comes
close to the average Tour stage length in 1926.
Pedaling Short, But Not So Sweet
In 1904, the race was new, and France both loved and hated its new
national cycling event. Race director Henri Desgrange created
something monumental and it was so successful in its 1903 debut
that the route wasn’t changed in 1904. But by the second year, not
all was well. Rampant cheating and fans’ outrageous behavior
nearly ended the event for good.
The Tour survived, and among many legendary occurrences, one
statistic from its first two years is sometimes overlooked. The
routes were identical, included six stages and totaled 2,428 kilome-
ters or 1,508 miles — the shortest Tours in history. The first year,
60 cyclists began the race and 21 finished. Eighty-eight riders
began the Tour’s second year, with 27 riders finishing.

Humbling Experience: 
300 Miles of Torture
The debut of the yellow jersey overshadowed most everything else
in the 1919 Tour. French rider Jean Alavoine didn’t get the jersey,
but his runner-up overall finish to Firmin Lambot was eased by his
five stage wins. Alavoine’s forte was his straightforward belief —
longer is better.
Alavoine never won the Tour, but his victory in the fifth stage from
Les Sable d’Olonnes to Bayonne covered 482 kilometers (300 miles),
the longest in Tour history. The severity of the stage took its toll in
two ways. Only 11 of 69 race starters finished the race, and those
who arrived in Paris had the slowest average race speed in Tour
history, 24.05 kilometers per hour or 14.94 mph. The Tour’s crawl-
ing average speed remains a dubious record. But in 1924, the same
300-mile route was covered again in the fifth stage. Omer Huysse
joined Jean Alavoine as winners of the longest Tour stages.
Speeding Over Hill and Dale
Lance Armstrong’s statistics are among the most impressive of any
Tour rider. His six consecutive titles top many lists of all-time great
athletic career accomplishments. But in 2003, en route to tying 
the mark of five straight titles, Armstrong, along with compatriot
Tyler Hamilton, Jan Ullrich of Germany, Joseba Beloki of Spain,
Frenchman Richard Virenque, and Kazakhstan’s Alexander
Vinokourov, among others, rode at a pace never before seen at 
the Tour.
Celebrating the Tour’s 100th anniversary, riders visited numerous
course sites from the inaugural Tour. Armstrong’s team, nicknamed
le Train Bleu (the Blue Train), powered their team leader over
mountains, and he powered himself through time trials.
Armstrong won the mountain stage to Luz-Ardiden, and the U.S.
Postal Service Team captured the team time trial. When Armstrong
crossed the finish line in Paris, his winning average speed was
40.94 kilometers per hour (25.43 mph), the fastest in Tour history.

Knowing Your Neighbors: 
An American in Paris
By the time he was a teenager, Jonathan Boyer of Carmel,
California, knew Europe held his cycling future. Beginning in 1973
at age 17, Boyer spent four years riding on French amateur teams,
and then turned professional. Boyer became severely ill with a
stomach virus contracted in Venezuela during the 1978 World
Championships. He took nearly two years to recover, but he
returned in grand fashion as a member of the French Renault-
Gitane squad led by Bernard Hinault, then a two-time Tour winner.
Hinault recruited Boyer to help him win the third of his five Tour
titles in 1981. But Boyer’s inaugural race presence was also a mile-
stone: It had taken more than 75 years of race legacy, but Boyer
was the first American to compete in the Tour de France. Four
years later, Greg LeMond became the first American to claim a
Tour stage.
Boyer, who still lives in Carmel, finished 32nd overall in his Tour
debut and completed the event five times, finishing as high as 12th
in the General Classification. He participated in the Tour of Italy
three times and won the U.S. National Road title and placed fifth in
the Road Race World Championships in 1980. Boyer retired from
pro cycling after finishing 98th in the 1987 Tour. He owns a whole-
sale cycling component distribution company and retail bike shop
near this hometown — and he still competes as an amateur rider in
regional events.
Climbing Into the Clouds: 
The Great Peaks of the Tour
Three years into the Tour’s legacy, the race changed forever. The
race’s first climb, Ballon d’Alsace, was part of the 11-stage, 26-day
1905 edition. Near the city of Belfort, the summit of Ballon d’Alsace
is 1,247 meters (3,990 feet). It’s short by modern Tour standards,
but it did its damage as the race’s first grand peak. More than 60
riders began the 1905 Tour and 14 finished.
Since then, epic climbs have been part of the Tour every year.
Through the years, five climbs have become the event’s most well
known and demanding:
Part V: The Part of Tens 
202

 L’Alpe d’Huez, 1,860 meters (5,952 feet): Fausto Coppi won
the inaugural ascent in 1952 while Joop Zoetemelk (1976),
Bernard Hinault (1986), Gianni Bugno (1990 and 1991), Andy
Hampsten (1992), Marco Pantani (1995–1997), and Lance
Armstrong (2001–2004) have all been victorious on the moun-
tain. L’Alpe d’Huez extends 13.8 kilometers (8.6) miles with an
average grade of 7.9 percent. It’s not the most difficult Tour
climb, but it’s the most storied. Spectators camp for days in
anticipation of watching cyclists negotiate the route’s 21
switchbacks.
 Col d’Izoard, 2,361 meters (7,744 feet): First used in 1922, the
Alpine climb extends 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) at an average
grade of 5.9 percent. Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon staged
an intense battle on the climb in 1989. But its reputation was
established in early Tour years by three-time race winner
Louison Bobet and two-time Tour victor Fausto Coppi.
 Col du Galibier, 2,645 meters (8,675 feet): Among the Tour’s
oldest climbs, the Galibier joined the Tour in 1911, when it
was still a dirt road. Often combined with the Col du
Telegraphe (1,566 meters, 5136 feet), the ascent, shown in
Figure 14-1, lasts 29.5 kilometers (18.3 miles) with an average
grade of 6.8 percent. Jacques Anquetil dominated the climb in
1957, and many others helped build their legends on the
climb, including Charley Gaul (1959), Eddy Merckx (1969),
Joop Zoetemelk (1972), Tony Rominger (1993), and Marco
Pantani (1998).
 Col du Tourmalet, 2,360 meters (7,552 feet): When it was
first included in the Tour in 1910, the stage was nicknamed
the Circle of Death. The Tourmalet extends 15 kilometers (9.3
miles) at an average 5.7 percent. It’s also known as La Mongie,
the name of the ski resort near the peak of the mountain. Like
other famed Tour climbs, this Pyrenees ascent has provided
many monumental Tour memories, including the words of
Octave Lapize. He called race officials assassins as he endured
the peak’s inaugural ascent. Eddy Merckx, Claudio Chiappucci,
and Richard Virenque, along with many others, have powered
to victories on the Tourmalet. A monument to Tour founder
Henri Desgrange is positioned on the top of the summit.
 Mont Ventoux, 1909 meters (6,261 feet): The most recent
addition to the Tour’s epic climbs, Mont Ventoux debuted in
1951 and has been included only 13 times. It extends for 21
kilometers (13 miles) at an average grade of 7.5 percent. It’s
sometimes called the Tour of the Moon because its summit is
barren — frequent strong winds have blown away trees and
other plant life. The climb has been infamous since the 1967
death of British rider Tom Simpson. While trying to catch the
Chapter 14: Ten Unique Tour de France Statistics 203

breakaway of popular rider Raymond Poulidor, Simpson col-
lapsed, and he died while being transported by helicopter to a
hospital. There’s a memorial marking the place where
Simpson fell and became the first Tour fatality in 40 years.

Ten Dramatic Tour de France
Moments
In This Chapter

 Riding into American history
S
udden, spectacular moments make the Tour de France what it
is. Racing can change in an instant, whether from a rider’s
quick acceleration, an unseen obstacle in the road, or a cyclist’s
unscripted emotional finish-line reaction. Great Tour moments are
etched in race lore, and they occur in an instant, year after year —
always when least expected.
Countless epic battles, horrific crashes, furious sprint finishes, and
curious split-second oddities have occurred in the race’s century-
plus history. It’s impossible to choose the best moments, but here
is our selection of ten dramatic Tour moments.
Assassins Among Us (1910)
Who could have known that the introduction of the first mountain
in the Tour de France in 1905 would five years later lead to perhaps
the race’s most famous quote? And who could have known some
Tour peaks encountered for the first time nearly 100 years ago
would become today’s race monoliths?
It was race founder Henri Desgrange, the person responsible for
many Tour innovations, who added several climbs in the Pyrenees
to the 1910 race. His goal was simple: increase race excitement to
increase circulation of his daily newspaper, L’Auto, which gave vast
coverage to the race.

During a two-day stretch, riders in Stage 8 in 1910 endured the
rigors of climbing obscure, mountainous dirt roads. Ascents like
Aspin, Tourmalet, Aubisque, and Peyresourde were included. Many
riders walked with their bikes on some of the difficult sections.
Octave Lapize of France got angry. As he progressed past the
halfway point of the Col d’Aubisque, Lapize noticed race officials
and he spoke his peace in their direction: “You’re assassins! All of
you!” said Lapize en route to his overall race win.
Lapize’s abrupt words have stood the test of time as the race’s
mountain mantra. Tour riders have a love-hate relationship with
the famous and infamous race peaks, and nothing speaks to the
severity of the climbs (and to the race directors who devise their
ascents) like Lapize’s outburst.
A Tour First: Death in the Peloton
(1935)
As the Tour approached its 30th birthday, the race was well estab-
lished, offered monumentally long stages, and was constantly
tweaked with new innovation. French riders often showed their
dominance and, beginning in 1930, they won five straight years.
Belgian Roman Mais ended the France dominance, but his win in
1935 was overshadowed by the Tour’s first racing death.
Stage 7 was the race’s key day. Progressing from Aix-les-Bains to
Grenoble, the stage included ascents over Telegraphe, the Galibier,
and the Lautaret. First, defending champion Antonin Magne of
France was struck by a car on the Telegraphe, badly hurt, and
transported to a hospital in a farmer’s cart. Soon after, on the
descent of the Galibier, Spanish rider Francisco Cepeda crashed
and fractured his skull. He died from his injuries three days later —
the Tour’s first racing victim.
Poulidor Versus Anquetil (1964)
Raymond Poulidor of France may have been the most well-liked
rider in Tour history. He won 189 races in his 18-year career, but he
never won the Tour de France. Frenchman Jacques Anquetil and
Eddy Merckx of Belgium, both five-time Tour winners, dominated
the race during Poulidor’s tenure, but because Poulidor kept trying
Part V: The Part of Tens 
206

in spite of injury and illness, he finished the Tour second or third
overall a combined eight times. He was affectionately known as
“Pou-Pou.”
Poulidor’s most memorable ride likely occurred when he and
Anquetil rode side by side for the final (10 kilometer (61⁄4-mile
stretch of the Puy de Dome, the final ascent of the 1964 Tour.
Poulidor was the stronger climber, but Anquetil held a 56-second
lead when he pulled next to Poulidor. The two riders stayed even
for much of the final climb and occasionally bumped each other, a
common occurrence in road race sprint finishes, but rare on moun-
taintops. Poulidor pulled away from Anquetil, the defending race
titlist. But Anquetil knew what he was doing. He still had a 14-
second margin for the final stage, a time trial — his specialty.
Anquetil won the time trial easily and claimed his fifth Tour de
France by 55 seconds over tough-luck Poulidor.
Merckx Attacked in the Mountains
(1975)
As a five-time winner, Eddy Merckx of Belgium began the 1975 race
as a surprisingly unknown factor. He was sick during the spring,
missed the Tour of Italy, and didn’t claim the other early season
races he usually dominated.
When the Tour began, Merckx wasn’t at his best, but he didn’t give
up easy. He won two stages of the ’75 race — the last Tour stage
wins of his career. But Merckx suffered often on climbs, crashed
several times, and then faced the end of his Tour dominance
because of a fan’s outburst.
On Stage 14 — the longest of the race — Merckx was chasing even-
tual third-place overall finisher and compatriot Lucien Van Impe. 
A spectator suddenly jumped from the crowd and punched
Merckx. Merckx lost time and stumbled across the line, vomiting.
Despite his physical problems, Merckx rode down the hill after the
race and identified his attacker to police. Merckx still had the race
lead following the ordeal. But he lost more time in subsequent
stages and ended up second overall. Two years later, Merckx
returned to the Tour for the last time and finished sixth in the 
overall standings.

Hampsten Conquers L’Alpe d’Huez
(1992)
Andy Hampsten twice won the Tour of Switzerland (1986 and 1987)
and also won the Tour of Italy (1988). But his triumphant ascent
and victory in the L’Alpe d’Huez stage of the 1992 Tour was likely
his most well-known accomplishment.
While riding for the U.S.-based Motorola team, Hampsten became
the first American to win the stage to the Tour’s most recognized
peak and ski resort. The climb to L’Alpe d’Huez is not the race’s
most difficult, but its 21 switchbacks provide great drama for 
on-site spectators and television viewers. Hampsten’s triumph
occurred two years after Greg LeMond’s third and final Tour title. 
It was also televised on CBS, which meant that Hampsten gave
American cycling a jolt of increased interest.
Hampsten finished as high as fourth overall in the Tour, and his
L’Alpe d’Huez title added his name to the list of now six U.S. riders
who have claimed Tour stage wins. Hampsten, founder of Cinghiale
Cycling Tours and co-owner of Hampsten Bikes with his brother
Steve, gave one of his road bikes the name Alpe d’Huez.
LeMond Rides into History
(1989)
Greg LeMond had a singular focus during the final stage of the 1989
Tour. He didn’t wear a watch and told his handlers not to tell him
his time during his ride; he then went on to ride the race of his
Tour career. Riding in a tuck position provided by aerodynamically
configured handlebars (like the tuck of an alpine skier), LeMond
overcame a 50-second deficit to Frenchman Laurent Fignon and
claimed his second Tour title by 8 seconds, the closest margin of
victory in race history.
LeMond knew he had ridden spectacularly, and it was quickly con-
firmed when his finishing time showed an average speed of 54.5
kph (33.8 mph), the fastest stage in Tour history. But LeMond still
had to wait for Fignon, the last rider on course, to finish. But
Fignon couldn’t make up the deficit. When he knew he had won,
LeMond leaped into the air, mouth agape, and then hugged his
wife. Fignon, the 1983 and ’84 Tour winner, collapsed near the
finish, defeated in his quest for a third title by just 8 seconds.

Armstrong Salutes Fallen Fabio
(1995)
Lance Armstrong and Fabio Casartelli of Italy were young team-
mates and good friends, and they both were part of the U.S.-based
Motorola squad competing in the 1995 Tour. Casartelli won the
1992 Olympic Road Race; Armstrong claimed the 1993 World
Championship Road Race.
But something went terribly wrong in Stage 15 of the 1995 Tour.
Frenchman climbing specialist Richard Virenque of France was at
the front of the group pedaling toward a stage win. Well behind the
stage leader, a helmetless Casartelli crashed with several other
riders on the descent of the Portet d’Aspet.
While racing at approximately 50 mph, Casartelli hit his head hard
against a cement railing and died en route to the hospital. The next
day’s stage was nullified out of respect to the deceased rider. Near
the stage finish, the entire remaining Motorola team was allowed to
come to the front of the peloton and cross the line together to
honor its fallen teammate. Two days later at Stage 18, which fin-
ished in Limoges, Armstrong got into a small breakaway group and
then powered to a solo win. As he approached the finish line,
Armstrong raised both index fingers toward the sky, acknowledg-
ing Casartelli. He later dedicated the win to his deceased teammate
and friend.
Sitting Down on the Job (1998)
Willy Voet was a soigneur for the French team Festina. When he
was stopped in his car en route to a cross-channel ferry headed for
the start of the 1998 Tour in Dublin, it marked the beginning of the
end of the most tumultuous Tour in history.
Part of Voet’s cargo was vials of EPO, the human growth hormone.
Voet was arrested and subsequently revealed his team’s doping
practices to law enforcement officials. As the Tour progressed, other
teams’ hotel rooms were raided and other riders were arrested,
including the entire Festina team. The race was in jeopardy.
Riders felt their rights were infringed upon, and during Stage 9,
they began a series of protests by dismounting their bikes and sit-
ting down on the road for two hours. The peloton eventually
resumed racing, and there was much discussion with race officials.
Chapter 15: Ten Dramatic Tour de France Moments 209

Protests continued throughout the race, and tempers flared. By the
time Italian Marco Pantani claimed the title in Paris, less than half
the field remained, and the Tour was in the midst of a huge identity
crisis and massive drug controversy.
Hamilton Shows His Mettle 
in the Mountains (2003)
For two weeks, Tyler Hamilton rode with the pain of a fractured
clavicle (collarbone). But Hamilton wanted something more as his
legacy. After riding for more than 70 miles with the peloton,
Hamilton pedaled to the front of the main pack while climbing the
Col de Bargargui in the 16th stage of the 2003 Tour from Pau to
Bayonne. He steadily built a 5-minute lead and rode more than 50
miles alone at the front of the race. 
Still heavily wrapped in bandages from the injury suffered in the
opening stage, Hamilton stayed in front, despite a strong effort
from the peloton, and he became only the sixth American to win a
Tour stage, joining Greg LeMond, Andy Hampsten, Davis Phinney,
Lance Armstrong, and Jeff Pierce.
Hamilton’s impressive solo win also endeared him to Tour fans,
who respected his ability to remain in the race despite an injury
that usually forces riders to abandon. Hamilton’s stage win and his
strong effort throughout the race prompted his finish in fourth
place, the highest of his Tour career. 
Riding through Hay Fields
(2003)
Lance Armstrong’s tenure at the Tour has included many exhilarat-
ing moments. Perhaps the most dramatic occurred in 2003 in Stage
9 from Bourg d’Osians to Gap.
French roads are often resurfaced for Tour stages. But in the nearly
omnipresent heat of the 100th anniversary Tour edition, a slight
downhill section melted while Spain’s Joseba Beloki and Armstrong
began to furiously chase stage leader Alexandre Vinokourov of
Kazakhstan.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
210

With Beloki slightly ahead of Armstrong, the duo accelerated to an
estimated 40 mph (65 kph). Beloki’s rear wheel suddenly spun out
in the melting tar. He swung back and forth for a few seconds, then
hit the pavement hard.
Armstrong reacted instantly and swerved to the left. He exited the
pavement and rode across a recently plowed field of hay and back
toward the race course. Armstrong dismounted his bike, jumped
with it across an irrigation ditch and joined a group of riders, just
arriving in another chasing pack. Beloki was escorted to a local
hospital with several broken bones, lacerations, and other injuries.
Armstrong finished second in the stage and went on to claim his
record-tying fifth consecutive Tour de France.

Ten Great Tour Climbs and
Mountaintops
In This Chapter
 Peaking on the peaks
 Climbing every mountain
 Airing it all out at altitude
G
reat climbers tend to win the Tour de France, and races are
won and lost on the mountains. Dozens of famous and infa-
mous peaks have been used during stages and as finishing sum-
mits. Although some climbs remain nearly the same every time
they’re contested, Tour organizers also look for mountain innova-
tion, like the introduction of the climb to L’Alpe d’Huez as an indi-
vidual time trial during the 2004 Tour. Just like the diverse styles of
race riders, Tour mountains have their own personalities.
Selecting the Tour’s ten most noteworthy ascents and mountaintop
finishes is next to impossible. But here are our choices of ten 
(well, thirteen, but who’s counting?) unique, famous, infamous,
unheralded, and wondrous Tour de France mountains, presented
alphabetically.
Aspin
One of several Pyrenees peaks added to the Tour in 1910, Aspin
(as-pan) been visited 64 times. The peak is 1,489 meters (4,888
feet) after a 12.5-kilometer (73⁄4-mile) climb at an average 6.3 percent
gradient. Roads are narrow, rough, and hazardous.

French race winner Octave Lapize was the first rider over the
summit in its 1910 debut. Since then, many legendary Tour per-
formers and its current riders have crested Aspin first en route to
stage wins, overall Tour wins, and infamous days in the Pyrenees.
Claudio Chiappucci of Italy was twice the first rider to the top (in
1990 and 1992). But Chiappucci rode during Miguel Indurain’s Tour
career, so he never won the race. Chiappucci’s strong climbing,
however, catapulted him to two second-place and one third-place
overall finishes during his Tour heyday (1990–1992).
American Bobby Julich, third overall in the 1998 Tour, is also
among riders who’ve reached the top of Aspin first, en route to
18th in the General Classification (the overall finish) in the 2001
Tour. Three years later, Julich was Olympic time trial bronze
medalist in Athens, Greece.
Aubisque 
The Aubisque (oh-beesk), a legendary Tour peak added in 1910,
has been conquered by great climbers, but it has also humbled
countless cyclists.
The Aubisque culminates at 1,709 meters (5,605 feet), and riders as
varied as Firmin Lambot of France (1920), Gino Bartali (1938) and
Fausto Coppi of Italy (1949 and 1952), Charly Gaul of Luxembourg
(1955), Eddy Merckx of Belgium (1969), Miguel Indurain of Spain
(1989), and Laurent Jalabert of France (2002) all mastered the
mountain.
Now part of the Tour more than 60 times, the Aubisque progresses
for 16.5 kilometers (101⁄4 miles) with an average grade of 7.1 percent
(see Figure 16-1).

Col d’Aubisque.
Courchevel
Courchevel (core-sha-vell), a ski resort in the Alps, is a newcomer
to the Tour and has only twice hosted a stage finish. Richard
Virenque, the seven-time winner of the best-climber jersey, was 
victorious in 1997. Marco Pantani, 1998 race winner, tamed the
21.8-kilometer (13.5-mile) and 6.3 percent average gradient ascent
(see Figure 16-2) en route to his stage win to Courchevel in 2000.

Galibier
Among the Tour’s longest climbs, the Galibier (gahl-eeb-bee-yay) is
often presented in the same stage as the Col du Telegraphe and is
among the race’s oldest ascents. It was first added in 1911 when,
like other notable Tour climbs, it was still a dirt road; riders often
got off their bikes and walked sections of the 29.5-kilometer (18.3-
mile) trek. Today, like all race mountains, the Galibier is a place for
great climbers to showcase their talents.
The climb has an average gradient of 6.8 percent, and that suited
Jacques Anquetil just fine. He dominated the 1,566-meter (5,136-
foot) climb in 1957, and many others have also contributed to their
legends with leading ascents of the climb and its 6.8 percent 
gradient — Charley Gaul (1959), Eddy Merckx (1969), Joop
Zoetemelk (1972), Tony Rominger (1993), and Marco Pantani
(1998).
Glandon
Introduced in 1947, Glandon peaks at 1,924 meters (6,240 feet) and
is often incorporated into a series of climbs during the Tour’s most
difficult days. Many of the Tour’s finest riders — three-time race
winner Louison Bobet of France (1948), Fausto Coppi of Italy
(1952), Stephen Rooks of the Netherlands (1988), Thierry
Claveyrolet of France (1990), and Frenchman Richard Virenque
(1994 and 1997) — all ruled the climb to Glandon.
Now part of the Tour on 13 occasions, the climb to Glandon is 27
kilometers (16.7 miles) with an average 4.5 percent gradient.
Izoard
Many of the Tour’s legendary riders have mastered Izoard (aye-
zore), the steep ascent into the Alps; the best known include
Fausto Coppi (1949 and 1951) and Louison Bobet (1950, 1953, and
1954). This mountain debuted in 1922 and quickly built its reputa-
tion as among the race’s most difficult climbs that peaks at 2,361
meters (7,744 feet).
Chapter 16: Ten Great Tour Climbs and Mountaintops 217

The climb continues for 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) and at an aver-
age gradient of 5.9 percent while advancing along dusty, winding
roads and through other varying landscape. Greg LeMond and
Laurent Fignon dueled on this mountain in 1989 (see Chapter 15).
L’Alpe d’Huez
It’s not the hardest ascent, but since its debut in 1952, L’Alpe
d’Huez (lalp-dwhez) has defined the mystique of Tour de France
mountains. Fausto Coppi won the inaugural ascent, a 9.5-mile climb
that included 21 switchbacks and an average gradient of 7.9 per-
cent. This mountain isn’t included every year, but in each of its
more than 20 editions, it’s the most highly anticipated race stage,
particularly for race fans.
Hundreds of thousands of spectators line the course, many arriv-
ing days in advance. It’s a party from start to finish, often to
excess, for spectators; it’s a dangerous grind for cyclists who often
have to negotiate their way through tight and rowdy crowds. The
finishing climb ends at 6,102 feet.
American Andy Hampsten, who twice finished fourth overall in 
the Tour, won the stage in 1992 — a first for an American. Lance
Armstrong claimed the stage in 2004 when, for the first time, the 21
switchbacks comprised an uphill individual time trial.
La Mongie
A ski resort near the top of the Tourmalet (tor-ma-lay), La Mongie
(lah moan-jee) has been a Tour stage finish area only three times.
The climb is 16.9 kilometers (10.5 miles) and the average gradient
of the Pyrenees climb is 8 percent (see Figure 16-3). Bernard
Thevenet of France (1970) was the inaugural winner at La Mongie.
Lance Armstrong has one victory (2002) and one second place
(2004) in the resort’s two other arrival years.
La Mongie stands at 1,715 meters (5,625 feet) and its nearby
summit, the top of the Tourmalet, is one of cycling’s grand mono-
liths at 2,114 meters (6,934 feet), the highest peak in the Pyrenees.
The Tourmalet was first included in 1910 and was nicknamed Circle
of Death, and this Pyrenees climb is where the legendary rider
Octave Lapize called race officials “assassins” as he negotiated the
mountain in its Tour debut (see Chapter 15). Eddy Merckx, Claudio
Chiappucci, and Richard Virenque have also been victorious on the
Tourmalet. At the peak of the Tourmalet, a monument honors race
founder Henri Desgrange.

Luz-Ardiden
One of the most popular ascents in recent Tours, Luz-Ardiden
(luze-ar-dee-dan) was first part of the Tour in 1985 when Spain’s
Pedro Delgado won the Pyrenees stage.
The peloton has returned ten more times to this ski station that
concludes with 13.4 kilometers (8.3 miles) at an average 7.6 per-
cent gradient (see Figure 16-4). Dag Otto Lauritzen of Norway

(1987), Miguel Indurain of Spain (1990), and Richard Virenque of
France (2001) have claimed Luz-Ardiden stage finishes. Lance
Armstrong and Jan Ullrich contested a great battle on the climb
during the 15th stage of the 2003 Tour from Bagneres de Bigorre to
Luz Ardiden. Armstrong won and Ullrich was third in one of the
more memorable Tour mountain ascents in recent years.

France (1995–1997), Jan Ullrich of Germany (1998), Michael
Boogerd of the Netherlands (2002), and Gilberto Simoni of Italy
(2004) all claimed the Madeleine climb.
The climb to Madeleine is 25.4 kilometers (15.8 miles) and has an
average gradient of 6.1 percent. During the 2004 Tour, Madeleine
was the highest point of the Tour.
Mont Ventoux 
First included in the Tour in 1951, this climb to the barren peak
above the French countryside is as infamous as it is famous. It
plateaus at 1,909 meters (6,261 feet); one kilometer from the top is
where British cyclist Tom Simpson collapsed and subsequently
died in 1967.
Like all great Tour mountains, Mont Ventoux (mon-von-too) is
steep and long. But it’s the legendary Mistral winds — the cold,
strong gusts that can surpass 100 mph (160 kph) — that most
affect the race. The brutal winds have swept away most vegetation
on the mountain, leaving it barren and brutally difficult for riders.
Mont Ventoux is called the Windy Mountain and sometimes, the
Tour of the Moon.
Mont Ventoux has been part of the Tour only 13 times, but it has
produced epic battles, including the 2000 challenge between Lance
Armstrong and Marco Pantani. Armstrong’s strategically eased up
at the finish line, allowing Pantani to claim the stage win. Pantani
was upset, stating he didn’t need Armstrong’s sympathy, and duo
began a nasty battle of words for the remainder of the Tour. 
Puy de Dome
Like several other Tour ascents, Fausto Coppi of Italy first con-
quered Puy de Dome (pwee-dah-dome) in its debut in the 1952
Tour. Spain’s Luis Ocana (1971) and Joop Zoetemelk of Holland
(1976 and 1978) also mastered the climb to the peak at 1,415
meters (4,461 feet). The peak has been utilized a mid-race climb,
and as a stage finish.
Puy de Dome is also the location of two of the Tour’s most storied
moments. Frenchmen Raymond Poulider and Jacques Anquetil
staged one the most respected and intense final climbs on the moun-
tains in 1964. It’s also where a fan punched Eddy Merckx of Belgium
as he rode past in 1975. Merckx never fully recovered from the
attack, and the punch was likely responsible for ending his career.

Sestrieres
A respected ski resort, Sestrieres (ses-tree-air) is just across the
French border in the Italian Alps. It has been used as both a mid-
stage climb and as a finish point at 2,003 meters (6,668 feet) — see
Figure 16-5. Sestrieres made its debut in 1952; Italian Fausto Coppi
was victorious that year, and the mountain has been mastered by
Claudio Chiappucci (1992) and Bjarne Riis of Denmark, the 1996
Tour winner on a solo breakaway win. Charly Gaul of Luxembourg
(1956) and Jose Jimenez of Spain (1966) are also Sestrieres climb
winners.

Lance Armstrong had plenty of nonbelievers when he returned to
the Tour de France in 1999. But he had many fewer detractors after
claiming the 9th stage from Le Grand Bornand to Sestrieres over
Alex Zulle of Switzerland and Fernando Escartin of Spain.
Armstrong had assumed the race lead the day before with a time
trial win in Metz, but his mountain stage win in Italy proved he
could climb with the sport’s best. After winning in Sestrieres, he
maintained the race lead en route to his first Tour title.

here’s no doubt that the Tour de France is cycling’s prestige
event. But cycling is increasingly competitive with a yearly 
calendar that begins in January and continues through December.
Beyond the Tour, the Giro d’Italia (Tour of Italy) and Vuelta a
Espana (Tour of Spain) are cycling’s other Grand Tours. The three-
week races have the highest rating of difficulty, according to Union
Cycliste Internationale (International Cycling Union), the sport’s
global governing body.
Winning the Tour of Italy is considered cycling’s second most
important stage race title, followed by the Tour of Spain.
Stage routes of Grand Tours change yearly, although some cities
are represented nearly every year. Routes for classics (longstand-
ing races that are hotly contested) generally remain the same, with
the exceptions of road construction changes or safety deviations.
In addition, cycling has yearly world championships for track and
road cycling, mountain biking, and cyclo cross, a road and moun-
tain biking hybrid. Winners of world championships earn white jer-
seys featuring five horizontal rainbow stripes. Winning the World
Championship Road Race is the most impressive single-day accom-
plishment in cycling.

Shorter stage races and myriad one-day races fill the calendar. For
riders preparing for the Tour, spring races are ideal for training,
testing fitness, and preparing the team. Cyclists, who excel as
single-day or shorter stage race riders, look for their moments 
of opportunity, depending on the events’ terrain and race-day 
circumstances.
With nearly a full year of races on the calendar, it’s difficult to 
highlight only a select few non-Tour events. But here are ten impor-
tant pro cycling events on the international calendar, listed 
alphabetically.
Amstel Gold Race
Still in its infancy compared with the historic classics, the Amstel
Gold Race has steadily built its reputation since its 1966 debut. The
event suits riders possessing strong, quick power, and savvy bike-
handling skills.
Sponsored by Netherlands’ most well-known brewery, the Amstel
Gold Race is the country’s only classic. The course meanders
through southern Holland (see Figure 17-1), and features more than
30 climbs, some with 23 percent grades. Narrow, winding roads
prevail for the classic held on the third week of April.

Clasica San Sebastian 
(San Sebastian Classic)
As Spain’s only major classic, the San Sebastian Classic began in
1981 and is held on the second Saturday in August in the coastal
city of the Basque region of northern Spain (see Figure 17-2). The
225-plus (140-mile) course features a half-dozen climbs, including
Jaizkibel, the race’s most difficult and often race-determining
ascent. It begins with about 20 miles left in the race.

Spain is hot in August, and attrition is often a factor at the San
Sebastian Classic, the newest of the European classics.
Lance Armstrong began his professional career at the event in
1992. He struggled, finished 111th (last place), and considered leav-
ing cycling with only a one-race career. One year later, however,
Armstrong won the world race title in Oslo, Norway.
Giro d’Italia (Tour of Italy)
Introduced in 1909 by its still-current sponsor, the Italian sports
newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, the Tour of Italy is conducted in
very similar fashion to the Tour de France. It has flat road stages,
time trials, and mountain ascents. The world’s best teams partici-
pate, just like in the Tour de France and Tour of Spain.
The leader of the overall Giro competition since 1931 has worn the
Maglia Rosa or pink jersey, the same color as the newsprint of
Gazetta dello Sport. The Giro also has the maglia verde (green
jersey) for best climber, maglia ciclamino (mauve jersey) for best
sprinter, and the intergiro (blue jersey) for best intermediate stage
competitor.
Since its early days, the Giro has attracted many of the sport’s
sports greats who achieved success before rabid fans. Italians
Alfredo Binda (1925, ’27, ’28, ’29, and ’33) and Fausto Coppi (’40,
’47, ’49, ’52, and ’53), and Belgian’s Eddy Merckx (’68, ’70, ’72, ’73,
and ’74) are the only five-time winners. Italian riders claimed the
race every year until 1950, but Giro winners now include cyclists
from numerous countries.
Held in May and June, the Giro usually ends slightly more than one
month before the start of the Tour. Numerous riders double by
riding in the Tour of Italy, and then the Tour de France. Marco
Pantani, the deceased Italian champion, was victorious in the 1998
Tour of Italy and Tour de France, the last rider to claim double
Grand Tours in the same year.
It’s only fitting another Italian, Mario Cipollini, has a record 42
career Giro stage wins. Andy Hampsten (1988) is the only American
winner of the Giro, although Greg LeMond was third in 1985 and
Tyler Hamilton placed second in 2002. Lance Armstrong has never
competed.

Liege-Bastogne-Liege
Cycling’s oldest classic began in 1892 and will be held for the 91st
time in 2005. The course is out-and-back from the city of Liege to
Bastogne in Belgium and is around 160 miles. It progresses through
tall pine trees; along tricky, cobblestoned roads; along vast green
fields; and into the Adrennes Mountains.
Considered among cycling’s most grueling one-day events, the
strenuous outbound segment to Bastogne is outdone by the more
hilly and difficult return trip. The route (see Figure 17-3) includes
ten climbs, many of them long, steep, and technical.

Unpredictable weather is the norm in Belgium, particularly in April
when the Liege-Bastogne-Liege is held on the fourth Sunday of the
month. Eddy Merckx, the nation’s hero, won the race five times,
and he’s honored with a monument along the course.
Milan–San Remo
The first World Cup race of the season is called La Primavera, and
is named after a flower that blooms in early spring. Milan/San
Remo began in 1907 and is held on the third Saturday of March.
The route extends from Milan to San Remo, a city on the Italian
Riviera.
While long (290 kilometers; 180 miles), Milan-San Remo is not as
difficult as its ancient course brethren, and the course includes
one major climb, the Turchino, and several less strenuous ascents
(see Figure 17-4). The race is largely flat and fast and it often fin-
ishes with a group sprint. American Fred Rodriguez was second in
2002.

Olympic Road Race
Part of the Summer Olympics since 1896, the Olympic Road Race is
prestigious, but it presents a riders’ dilemma. Like the World
Championships, the Olympic Road Race is contested by five-rider
teams competing for their respective countries, not for their inter-
national trade teams.
Open to professionals since 1996, riders participate in the Olympic
Road Race after already riding for the bulk of the season. If
selected by their respective countries to participate, cyclists may
ride with countrymen whom they ride against for most of the year.
Likewise, riders from other countries may form alliances with
trade team teammates competing for other countries. It’s not offi-
cially allowed, but it happens.
Because the Olympics are held in varying countries, the Olympic
Road Race course is never the same. Pascal Richard of Switzerland
(1996), Jan Ullrich of Germany (2000), and Paolo Bettini of Italy
(2004) have won the Olympic Road Race since its pro-rider debut.
The Olympic Road Race for women was added to the Summer
Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984; Americans Connie-Carpenter-
Phinney and Rebecca Twigg won the gold and silver, respectively.
Paris Roubaix
This race is simultaneously famous and infamous, and it’s often
called The Queen of the Classics or The Hell of the North. Like
cycling in the Summer Olympics, Paris Roubaix began in 1896 and
is considered cycling’s most grueling one-day race.
Although sections have changed, the estimated 250-kilometer 
(155-mile) course now includes 26 segments of often gnarly,
muddy, and treacherous cobblestones that have ruined many
riders’ days for the last century or so. If weather is perfect, the
race (held the second Sunday in April) is brutally difficult for even
the strongest cyclists. During inclement weather years, even
riders’ greatest skills can be nullified instantaneously by bad luck.
Great riders do well at Paris Roubaix, but lucky great riders often
emerge victorious.
George Hincapie’s second-place finish to Tom Boonen of Belguim in
2005 was the only podium finish by an American in Paris Roubaix.
Chapter 17: Ten Other Important Races 233

Tour of Flanders
The most prestigious classic in Belgium, the Tour of Flanders is
held on the first weekend of April. Its 260-kilometer (160-mile)
course meanders through small villages, past windmills, and
through the Belgian countryside. Along with Paris-Roubaix, the
Amstel Gold Race, and Liege-Bastgone-Liege, the Tour of Flanders
commences cycling’s finest month of classics.
Introduced in 1913, the Tour of Flanders is flat and fast. The race’s
second half features several cobblestone climbs that can quickly
divide the field into contenders and riders seeking only to finish
and escape severe suffering. This race has a total of 18 climbs,
including the famed Koppenburg climb.
Vuelta a Espana (Tour of Spain)
Last of the Grand Tours, the Tour of Spain has gained prestige in
recent years, particularly since it was moved from the spring to
fall. It’s the least heralded of the Grand Tours and dates to 1935.
Like the Tour de France and Tour of Italy, the Tour of Spain has an
overall competition and race leader’s jersey, the jersey oro or
golden jersey. Various sub-competitions for best climber and
sprinter are contested, too. Held in September, the course profile
showcases the golden, rolling hills of Spain. Its steep climbs are
legendary.
While not as popular as the Tour de France or Tour of Italy, the
Tour of Spain is the country’s cycling showcase and is often domi-
nated by Spanish riders. While competing in one or two Grand
Tours per season is a fine accomplishment for any pro cyclist, a
small, hearty fraternity of riders through the years has completed
all three Grand Tours in one season. In 2001, Levi Lephiemer was
third overall, the first American to stand afoot the podium in Spain
while riding for the U.S. Postal Service Cycling Team (now called
the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team).
World Championship (Road Race)
Cycling’s most prestigious one-day race, the World Championship
Road Race is the final event of the world competition, and is held
in a different country every year. Besides the Olympic Road Race,
it’s the only event in which riders compete for their countries, not
their trade teams.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
234

The route is all-important in the World Championship Road Race.
Courses are usually repeated circuits of a lengthy loop around the
hosting city. Hilly courses are conducive to skilled stage racers,
while flat world courses favor a pack finish, with superior sprinters
likely at the front. Most World Championship Road Races are held
at high speeds, and they often become races of attrition, with less
than 50 percent of starters finishing.
The winner of the World Championship Road Race is awarded the
rainbow jersey. It’s a white jersey with five horizontal stripes (blue,
red, black, yellow, and green) around the chest and arms of the
jersey. The World Champion wears the rainbow jersey for one year
at all road races, and his jersey is the second most coveted in
cycling, after the Tour’s yellow jersey.
