Abstract—As the COVID-19 pandemic led to worldwide lock-
downs, cybercriminals quickly took advantage of users’ increased 
usage and reliance on the Internet. In this paper, we carry out 
a comprehensive measurement study of phishing attacks in the 
early months of the pandemic by collecting and analyzing DNS 
records, TLS certifcates, phishing URLs, source code of phishing 
websites, phishing emails, web traffc to phishing websites, news, 
and government announcements. Using our dataset, we track 
trends and consequences in the growth of such phishing activities 
between January 2020 and May 2020. 
We fnd that phishing attack traffc skyrocketed to 220% of 
its pre-COVID-19 rate, exceeding typical seasonal spikes, with 
attackers exploiting victims’ uncertainties about and fears of the 
pandemic through a variety of scams, including emerging scam 
types against which current defenses are not suffcient. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The COVID-19 pandemic has upended daily life across 
the globe and has led to unprecedented changes from two 
perspectives. First, the ensuing widespread lockdowns, travel 
restrictions, and telecommuting (working from home) arrange­
ments have signifcantly increased users’ reliance on online 
services. Second, continuous updates from news outlets and 
social media have caused panic about the rapid community 
spread of the disease [15]. Unfortunately, this increased usage 
of the Internet and the unstable emotions of its users have 
left the users vulnerable to online social engineering attacks, 
such as scams and phishing, more than ever [4]. For instance, 
attackers exploit users’ fear to trick them into acting now 
instead of making an informed decision: An example COVID­
19 phishing email exploits Internet users’ fear by stating “this 
is the last set of test kits.” Besides fear, attackers also capitalize 
on people’s pain: While people desire to help others during 
major tragedies, scammers create fake donation campaigns as 
a lure to mount attacks. 
Abundant news reports and government alerts about phish­
ing attacks underscore the signifcance of anti-phishing sys­
tems [31]. However, such reports are generally anecdotal, and 
comprehensive studies on phishing (and other cybercrime) 
related to the pandemic are needed to inform the society to 
better respond to these threats. 
This need, combined with a lack of studies on the rela­
tionship between large social shifts (such as the pandemic) 
and phishing attacks, motivates us to investigate the effect of 
COVID-19 on phishing trends, the effects of these changing 
trends on phishing victims, and possible defensive actions that 
can be taken to protect users in this dangerous online situation. 
Specifcally, in this paper, we seek to answer the following 
research questions: 
• How has the COVID-19 situation affected trends in 
phishing attacks? 
• How many victims have visited phishing websites related 
to the pandemic? 
• What are the attackers exploiting? 
• How can we improve anti-phishing systems to protect 
users and organizations from phishing threats that lever­
age massive global situations like COVID-19? 
To answer the research questions, we collected a variety 
of datasets in the course of conducting our research: (1) 
We collected news articles and government announcements 
about phishing attacks that are related to the COVID-19 
pandemic; (2) We gathered and monitored DNS records, issued 
TLS certifcates, and reported phishing websites to measure 
how the pandemic has affected the Internet infrastructure; (3) 
We crawled source code of corona-related phishing websites 
among reported phishing websites to explore what types of 
corona-related phishing content are used; (4) By collaborating 
with a major fnancial services organization, we used a spe­
cialized network monitor to analyze trends in victim traffc to 
phishing websites and the volume of phishing reports by users 
of the organization. This gives us an unparalleled view from 
the organization’s perspective; and (5) We collected COVID-
19-related discussions from two large underground forums to 
fnd cybercriminals’ activities related to the pandemic. 
We performed a multi-faceted analysis of the collected 
datasets. Through our analysis, we made several interesting 
fndings of the frst several months of COVID-19: 
• Record attack volume. We observed that traffc to 
phishing websites reached record levels in March and 
April 2020, with up to 2.2 times more users falling victim 
to phishing than average. Cybersecurity warnings from 
governments and major industry organizations lagged 
behind the attacks. 
• Social engineering strategies. During COVID-19, at­
tackers exploited both users’ altruism and self-interest. 

For example, we found attacks that impersonated the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that 
harvested credentials and user identities while making 
users believe they were making a donation. Conversely, 
myriad fraudulent storefronts pretended to sell personal 
protective equipment (PPE) or attempted to sell counter­
feit goods such as fake COVID-19 testing kits. 
• Current defenses. Traditional anti-phishing systems are 
primarily reactive in nature and, thus, struggle to quickly 
protect users, at scale, in the face of novel types of 
phishing attacks. In addition, ecosystem defenses against 
non-phishing scams have a lesser degree of maturity. 
Much to our surprise, despite being the most prevalent 
browser-based threat [14], phishing is not the major threat 
among all COVID-19-related online attacks. In the frst four 
months of 2020, we identifed 467,323 COVID-19-related 
domain registrations; a curated whitelist indicated that just 
0.16% (774) of these domains were benign [25]. Among all the 
registered domains, we found out that only 0.22% (1,047) of 
them appeared on phishing blacklists. Therefore, we concluded 
that phishing websites only represented a small fraction of 
malicious COVID-19 domains. As such, defenses against other 
types of scams are as important as anti-phishing defenses. To 
this end, we provide in our paper a taxonomy of other types of 
scams, such as fake storefronts or deceptive donation pages. 
We also recommend new ecosystem defenses to identify these 
scam websites and protect users from them as future work. 
The contributions of this paper are thus as follows: 
• Our study clearly shows that attackers move quickly to 
develop novel types of attacks to exploit users’ increased 
vulnerability during a crisis. 
• This work is the frst step in comprehensively investigat­
ing phishing attack trends as a result of COVID-19 and 
motivates standardized approaches to not only keep up 
with the agility of attackers but also help guide timely 
mitigations to protect users from sophisticated online 
scam threats. 
II. BACKGROUND 
In social engineering attacks, attackers lure victims to 
get sensitive information. Phishing is a common type of 
social engineering attack in which criminals masquerade as 
trustworthy entities to take advantage of targeted victims. 
Attackers typically manipulate the victims to submit their 
credentials by exploiting their fear, curiosity, charitable spirit, 
or apprehension [40, 41]. As routine daily tasks are becoming 
digital, people rely more on internet services. The migration of 
tasks from traditional and paper-based to online has provided 
opportunities for cybercriminals to lure victims [17]. 
Cybercrime typically has three main components: (1) a 
victim who is the target for a cyber-attack, (2) a motive which 
is the criminal’s incentive for committing the attack, and (3) 
a vulnerability or opportunity that enables the crime to take 
place [34]. When the online presence of users increases, the 
frst two conditions will be met. Different principles affect the 
third factor for a successful attack, such as distraction, time 
pressure, compassion, and need [35]. When the mentioned 
conditions are met, the attackers’ activities usually increase as 
they can maximize their success rate [38]. In the past, attackers 
have seen natural disasters as a prime opportunity to carry out 
social engineering. For example: 
Ebola Virus Outbreak. The largest Ebola outbreak occurred 
in 2014 and lasted two years in west Africa. Although the 
Ebola virus did not spread worldwide, attackers targeted 
affected groups of people with phishing and scams. 
Barracuda Networks reported 200,000 spam emails with 
Ebola news updates attempted to make people open links 
in the email, and 700,000 scam emails solicited donations 
to fctitious organizations [22]. 
Australia’s Bushfre. During the Australia bushfre that hap­
pened in late 2019, attackers claimed to be from large 
organizations, government, or popular charities to deceive 
people into donating money or providing sensitive infor­
mation [12]. 
Unlike the above natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic 
has caused worldwide panic and, thus, miscreants have been 
exploiting the empathy and fear of people by deploying scam 
or phishing websites with COVID-19 themed content [6]. 
This paper, investigates social engineering scams and phishing 
related to the pandemic by conducting a preliminary measure­
ment study. 
III. DATASET 
In this section, we discuss the dataset that we collected to 
conduct a comprehensive measurement study on phishing at­
tacks related to the pandemic. Our datasets cover news reports 
and government announcements, domain names, TLS certifca­
tions, reported phishing URLs, reported phishing emails, and 
posts from underground forums. Table I shows an overview 
of our datasets. 
A. Terminology 
For the sake of brevity, throughout the paper, we use the 
term corona-related to refer to any data related to the COVID­
19 pandemic. 
To fnd corona-related news and domains in our datasets, we 
used keywords that include: covid, covid-19, and coronavirus, 
along with their permutations. Using regular expressions, we 
also considered keywords related to COVID-19 that use special 
characters or numbers, such as c0-vi-d-19. 
B. Summary of The Dataset 
We collected the following data for this study: 
News and government announcements. From media out­
lets, governments, and private companies, we automat­
ically collected news and announcements about social 
engineering attacks related to the pandemic. We then 
fltered those that are relevant to phishing attacks that 
reference the pandemic. We searched Google News with 
the keywords {corona, covid-19, scam, phishing} to

gather news from both government and non-government 
websites. 
Domain names. To investigate the changes in trends of regis­
tered domains, we collected DNS records from three dif­
ferent sources: (1) Domaintools [20], (2) Whois Domain 
Search [3], and (3) RiskIQ [31] to fnd corona-related do­
main names registered on a daily basis. Both Domaintools 
and RiskIQ provide data sources for corona-related regis­
tered domains, whereas Whois Domain Search provides 
daily domain registrations that we fetched and scanned 
for corona-related domains. 
TLS certifcates. To fnd certifcates issued to web sites us­
ing corona-related domain names and phishing websites 
related to the pandemic, we collected 144,590,199 TLS 
certifcates using the Google Rocketeer CT log [13]. 
Reported phishing URLs. We collected phishing URLs sub­
mitted to OpenPhish [1] and the Anti-Phishing Working 
Group (APWG) [2]. 
Source code of phishing websites. We crawled the source 
code of 49,306 phishing websites between January 2020 
and April 2020 (using the APWG URLs) to investigate 
corona-related phishing content and techniques. 
Phishing emails and traffc to phishing websites. 
Between January and April 2020, we analyzed 387,251 
phishing emails reported by users, and signals based on 
victim traffc to phishing websites, by collaborating with 
an organization commonly targeted by phishing. 
Underground forums. We studied two underground forums 
to understand their members’ activities regarding the 
COVID-19 pandemic. We crawled corona-related data 
from two underground forums: Nulled.to and Cracked.to, 
which are popular underground forums that have more 
than 2.8 million and 1.1 million registered members, 
respectively. 
IV. MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
To analyze the corona-related datasets, we take a com­
prehensive approach, frst discussing overall measurement 
results, followed by the analysis results from each dataset. 
In Section IV-B, we show the trend of corona-related DNS 
records and reported phishing websites. Next, in Section IV-C, 
we analyze the news from both unoffcial and government 
offcial news outlets to measure the importance of COVID-19 
themed phishing and scams. We further analyze victim traffc 
to phishing websites in Section IV-D. Then, we categorize and 
explain various types of COVID-19 themed phishing websites 
in Section IV-E. We leverage underground forums data to fnd 
the corona-related topics discussed during the pandemic in 
Section IV-F. 
A. General Findings 
a) Record-breaking victims: Even though in our dataset, 
phishing attacks leveraging the pandemic seem to be negligible 
compared to traditional attacks, there was a record-breaking 
number of phishing victims (described fully in Section IV-D). 
We believe this is because the phishing attacks directly exploit 
people’s pandemic-related wants and needs with high-quality 
phishing websites (Section IV-E). We observed that the num­
ber of news reports and government announcements regarding 
corona-related phishing attacks increased rapidly from March 
2020 (Section IV-C). However, there were still many victims, 
which implies that anti-phishing systems’ reactive way of 
mitigation is not enough to protect users from a surge of novel 
phishing attacks. 
b) No ecosystem defenses for non-phishing scams: We 
found 467,323 new corona-related domain names and 17,699 
new certifcates issued to corona-related domains from our 
observation period. Among them, only 0.22% (1,047) of new 
corona-related domains were reported to phishing blacklists 
(Section IV-B and Section IV-D). Also, one curated list sug­
gests that only 774 legitimate corona-related domains are be­
nign domains [25]. Furthermore, the recent FTC report showed 
that 54,813 corona-related scams is reported by people across 
the U.S. from January, led users to lose $40.13M to fraud [43]. 
Based on this report, online shopping is the most commonly 
reported scam. This implies that phishing is just one type 
of many corona-related attacks. Other corona-related domains 
could be used for different fraudulent purposes, such as scam 
websites. Cybercriminals are exploiting the ecosystem’s lack 
of defense against non-phishing scams. 
B. Domain Names and Certifcates 
We provide an overview of corona-related websites and 
phishing sites based on domain names and URLs. 
As Figure 1 illustrates, we frst found that the number of 
corona-related domain names started increasing from early 
March 2020. On average, 155 corona-related domain names 
were registered every day before March 2020; however, this 
number increased to 7,453 in March and April. With the 
increase in new corona-related websites, it is diffcult to

distinguish between legitimate websites and malicious ones. 
As shown in Figure 1, the number of certifcates issued to 
corona-related domain names increases starting in February 
2020 and peaks in March 2020. 
We further analyzed 72 certifcates of corona-related HTTPS 
phishing websites as in Table II. Table III shows that CAs 
which issued certifcates to corona-related phishing websites 
with the number of certifcates and revoked certifcates. Except 
for GoDaddy and Sectigo, the other CAs use the Automatic 
Certifcate Management Environment protocol, allowing at­
tackers to obtain TLS certifcates easily. Only GoDaddy and 
cPanel revoked 5 and 2 certifcates issued to phishing websites 
as of May 25, respectively. 
We query the collected DNS records against APWG, Open-
Phish, GSB, and RiskIQ blacklist to measure how long it takes 
for a corona-related phishing URL to be reported after launch. 
Table IV shows the number of intersections between collected 
corona-related DNS records and each phishing blacklist. We 
calculate the average gap between the registration date and 
date of each report. From 467, 323 DNS records we collected, 
110 domains were reported to the APWG, on average 3.6 days 
after registration, and 72 domains were reported to OpenPhish 
4.8 days after registration. As GSB and the RiskIQ blacklist 
do not provide the reported date of domain names, we were 
unable to calculate the average gap. Also, we found that 110 
domains reported to the APWG were newly registered in 2020; 
however the other 44% of reported domains existed before Jan 
1st 2020. Table II shows that 198 domains were reported to 
the APWG from January 2020 to April 2020. 
C. Public Phishing Guidance 
To study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on corona-
related social engineering attacks, we examined how news 
outlets, governments, and large companies have provided 
guidance or warnings against phishing and scam attacks. To 
this end, we collected daily news reports and government 
announcements starting from January 2020. 
Figure 2 shows the number of corona-related news reports 
and government and company announcements. The news re-

stating that several phishing campaigns are sending corona-
related emails containing malware. The frst offcial U.S. 
government announcement about corona-related scams was 
made on February 4th by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), which warns people about cybercriminals 
trying to leverage the COVID-19 situation. 
After the original SEC announcement, the number of news 
reports related to corona-related scams increased rapidly. How­
ever, the U.S. government did not make many announcements 
about corona-related phishing attacks until the beginning of 
March 2020, when several additional government departments 
posted alerts. As shown in Figure 2, companies started to 
directly address corona-related scams at the beginning of 
March, with an increasing trend thereafter. The rapid growth of 
news from different sources motivates us to further investigate 
these scams. 
As illustrated in Figure 3, most of the U.S. government 
announcements are from FTC, followed by the Department

of Justice, while states only published one warning on their 
offcial websites (shown as “other”). The announcements warn 
people about scams and compromising users’ sensitive infor­
mation such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs), and typically 
include detailed guidance for how members of the public can 
protect themselves from fraud. 
D. Phishing Trends 
As shown in Figure 4, the number of phishing hostnames 
reported to two major clearinghouses of phishing URLs did 
not increase signifcantly during the COVID-19 outbreak. 
However, hostname counts alone fail to accurately refect the 
damage caused by phishing attacks, as certain high-impact 
websites may receive substantially more traffc than others as 
a result of their increased spamming activity or the ability to 
evade defenses [29]. 
To deepen our insight into phishing trends during the crisis, 
we collaborated with a fnancial services organization that is 
commonly targeted by phishers and analyzed two additional 
datasets: (1) traffc to phishing websites by targeted victims 
and (2) phishing emails reported by users. The phishing 
website traffc was collected using a recently proposed network 
monitoring approach [29] which passively measures victim 
visits to live phishing websites based on signals (referrer 
headers as well as third-party resources embedded on phishing 
websites) detectable by the organization. Specifcally, it frst 
analyzes web traffc logs to fnd events of interest. Then, after 
fltering out benign events, it looks for events correlated with

known phishing URLs. Further analyzing the events enables us 
to determine how many victims have fallen for corona-related 
phishing websites1. As shown in Figure 5, the network monitor 
recorded a surge in phishing victims from late March; attack 
volume remained elevated throughout April. Overall, the total 
number of observed phishing victims in March and April was 
2.207 and 1.706 times higher than in February, respectively, 
also 2.165 and 1.674 times higher than in January, when the 
organization typically sees elevated phishing volume due to 
holiday shopping. 
Phishing reports that users sent to the organization validate 
our observed increase in victim traffc, as a sustained rise in 
reporting is directly linked to an increase in spamming [23]. 
1.056 times more emails were reported to the organization 
in March, and 2.641 times more in April, compared to the 
number of reports in February. 
Interestingly, within this dataset, only 0.51% of phish­
ing websites had corona-related content. Similarly, 0.02% of

of being linked to victims successfully fooled by phishers, and have been 
de-duplicated to refect individual sessions.

emails had COVID-19 keywords in the title or body, while 
0.43% had such keywords in the sending email address. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global 
pandemic on March 11th . Even though there are not many 
corona-related phishing websites, the number of victims in­
creased dramatically after the WHO’s pandemic announce­
ment, as shown in Figure 5b. Moreover, the government 
announcements increased after the victim counts reached their 
peak in March. We suspect that not many corona-related 
phishing websites could take advantage of many victims within 
a short period after March 11th . 
We conclude that through an increase in spamming activity 
against a larger attack surface, the pandemic led to record 
numbers of phishing victims. However, in the case of this 
organization, phishing attacks that leveraged COVID-19 as a 
lure were negligible compared to traditional attacks that simply

impersonate the brand. We note that the latter trend is likely 
skewed by the brand’s industry sector, however. 
E. COVID-19 Themed Phishing 
We crawled and fetched the source code of 49,306 phishing 
websites from the APWG feed. We further considered corona-
related scam websites reported to scam.directory. By analyzing 
their source code, we found 255 unique phishing and scam 
websites that have corona-related content. 
Donation-Themed Phishing. Some phishing websites steal 
sensitive information while making users think they are do­
nating. For example, we identifed one prominent phishing 
website which copied the look-and-feel of a donation portal 
run by a major organization. The phishing website deceptively 
informed visitors that they were making a donation to the 
“CDC Response to CoronaVirus” through a registered char­
ity, and provided detailed information about this (legitimate) 
charity. Victims successfully fooled by the attack—which we 
observed across several distinct domains—would think they 
were making a small donation to support the charity. However, 
the phishing website would instead steal the victims’ account 
credentials and credit card numbers, rather than processing 
actual donation payments. 
PPE Sale. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face 
masks and gloves, is in high demand when the public and 

healthcare workers try to protect themselves from commu­
nicable diseases. In the early months of the pandemic, such 
equipment was also in short supply (or excessively priced) 
at major online retailers such as Amazon, eBay, or Walmart. 
Therefore, people in urgent need of PPE may turn to other 
sources. To exploit the high demand, attackers designed fake 
shopping websites that sell PPE, an example is shown in 
Figure 6a. 
Several such websites embedded up-to-date corona-related 
information (e.g., COVID-19 statistics) in an effort to appear 
more legitimate. They lure people who require such equipment 
and then either steal their credentials, steal their money, or sell 
them low-quality PPE. 
Fraudulent Online Shopping Websites. Fraudulent websites 
try to keep up with the look and feel of legitimate websites. 
As more and more legitimate organizations start to inform 
their customers about pandemic-related matters such as policy 
updates, new features, and COVID-19 statistics, attackers also 
include such information on their websites. Similarly, some 
attackers advertise misleading “free shipping” offers on their 
fake shopping websites. Free shipping offers increase online 
sales and help attract visitors [32]. Figure 6b shows an example 
of such a website. 
Exploiting Corona-related Events. Phishers not only gen­
erate corona-related phishing websites, but they also exploit 
other events related to the pandemic. For example, to help 
address widespread fnancial hardship, the U.S. government 
offered stimulus funds by either direct deposit or a paper 
check. However, different groups of people received payments 
at different times. When people who received a check and 
shared this on social media, others might start to worry about 
if and when they will also receive their funds. Phishers were 
quick to disguise themselves as the IRS to steal the personal 
information of people looking for the status of their stimulus 
payments. For example, in Figure 7, IRS phishing websites 
steal Dropbox credentials or SSNs from users amid the pan­
demic. The text “Expires in 2 days” in the phishing website 
from Figure 7a conveys urgency so that visitors are more 
willing to open it. Figure 7b acquires users’ SSN by declaring 
that they need such Personally Identifable Information (PII) 
to process stimulus payments. 
F. COVID-19 in Underground Forums 
As underground forums have been the rendezvous sites for 
cybercriminals [36, 37], we studied underground forums to 
answer two questions: (1) Are corona-related topics popular 
topics in underground forums? (2) What do members discuss 
about corona-related topics? 
First, we measured the number of threads and posts within 
a one-week sliding window because they indicate new dis­
cussion instances and members’ overall levels of activity. We 
found 2,913 members engaging in 144 coronavirus-related 
threads among 3,530 posts. Then, we manually analyzed 
all of these threads and categorized them into four topics: 
(1) account (54.7%, e.g., compromised accounts trading); (2)

virus (34%, e.g., what the coronavirus is); (3) money (7.8%, 
e.g., how to make money during the pandemic); (4) hacking 
(3.5%, e.g., hacking services the pandemic). Members in 
underground forums mainly discussed compromised accounts 
and the coronavirus itself, as shown in Table V. 
Figure 8 shows the number of different topics discussed 
in underground forums over time. At the beginning of the 
pandemic, people mainly discussed and shared information on 
the coronavirus; discussions shifted to compromised accounts 
from April 1st , and there is a signifcant peak at April 15th . 
58.3% of the new threads for trading compromised accounts 
were started during this period. Because the total number of 
observed phishing victims peaked between March 1st and 
April 15th (as shown in Figure 5), we suspect that the attackers 
posted about stolen accounts after they successfully launched 
their attacks. 
V. DISCUSSION 
Our dataset and analysis represent a current snapshot of 
specifc corona-related cybercrime and sheds light on how at­
tackers exploited the COVID-19 pandemic in the early months 
of the outbreak. The pandemic upended daily lives across 
the globe and, consequently, also resulted in unprecedentedly 
rapid changes across the digital world. These changes open 
up a new yet important set of challenges for website owners, 
users, governments, and security researchers to be able to adapt 
accordingly. 

Our results demonstrate that attackers remain several steps 
ahead of modern anti-phishing defenses and take advantage 
of a global crisis to harm online users directly. It is of great 
importance to collaboratively deploy anti-phishing systems 
that can better adapt to changes in the ecosystem, to narrow 
the attack window available to phishers and perhaps go further 
to offer proactive defenses. 
From the corona-related domain perspective, 0.16% of do­
mains in our dataset are known benign, and 0.22% of domains 
in our dataset are known malicious. We have discovered that 
many of the otherwise unknown domains are used for non-
phishing scams, which directly harm users yet remain out of 
the reach of traditional anti-phishing defenses. 
From our deep dive into the content of corona-related 
phishing websites, we noted the importance of human factors 
and how attackers exploit individuals’ pandemic-driven wants 
and needs. Hence, it is critical to quickly educate people to 
better understand social engineering attacks so that they can 
protect themselves when technical mitigations fail to do so. 
This paper is the frst step toward investigating phishing 
attacks, trends, and consequences amid a global pandemic 
through comprehensive measurements. We will continue our 
measurements to observe the effect on phishing and scams 
once the crisis subsides. Also, future work should develop a 
new monitoring framework to reliably conduct comprehensive 
and holistic measurements in an automated way, to enable 
early characterization and detection of emerging types of 
phishing attacks by using such real-time monitoring results. 
VI. RELATED WORK 
A. Mitigating Phishing 
Phishing attacks, the most prevalent web-based threat, have 
caused substantial damage to victims [18, 39]. To detect and 
mitigate phishing attacks, much research effort focused on 
analyzing phishing URLs [9, 10, 19, 21] and website con­
tent [8, 11, 44, 46, 48]. 
Sahingoz et al. [33] proposed a method to detect phishing 
websites based on the URL. They extract Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) based features such as word counts, word 
length, and TLD to train a random forest classifer capable 
of detecting phishing URLs. While they show their proposed 
method outperforms previous models, adversaries can bypass 
URL classifcation algorithms [5]. 
As content-based approaches are proved to have a better 
performance than URL based methods [28], most of the new 
methods focus on analyzing the page content and search 
engine metadata [45]. Ardi et al. proposed a content-based 
method for detecting phishing websites on demand. Their 
method leverages the Document Object Model (DOM) of a 
webpage to detect phish. This method breaks the DOM tree 
into chunks and computes the hash of each chunk. If the 
number of chunks that matches the hashed blacklist content is 
greater than a threshold, it fags the webpage as a suspected 
phish. This method provides good performance and zero 
false positive rate [7]. However, an attacker can simply use 
homographs (look-alike characters) or replace the content with 
images to bypass the detection method [7]. 
Google Safe Browsing [42] and Microsoft SmartScreen [24] 
are currently deployed mitigation systems across major web 
browsers for protecting users from phishing attacks. They 
detect a phishing website based on a URL blacklist or a 
heuristic classifer. As the only mitigation against phishing 
attacks is the blacklists, if blacklists do not offer adequate 
protection, users will be exposed to phishing threats without 
any protection [26]. 
B. Limitations of Current Anti-phishing Systems 
Several research works revealed the limitations of blacklist-
based anti-phishing approaches [16, 27, 28, 30]. Han et al. [16] 
monitored the lifecycle of phishing websites from the creation 
of them by using a honeypot web server. Oest et al. [27] 
conducted an empirical study on the blacklisting coverage 
and response time. In this work they propose the PhishFarm 
framework. PhishFarm frst deploys different phishing web­
sites, then it reports the deployed websites and waits for the 
anti-phishing entities to blacklist the reported websites. By 
using this framework, they test the resilience of anti-phishing 
entities. Peng et al. [30] measured the performance of the 
VirusTotal and its third-party vendors with their own phishing 
sites. They use a similar method as PhishFarm to study the 
reliance and robustness of VirusTotal and its 68 third-party 
vendors. In this work, they set up their own phishing websites 
while monitoring the incoming traffc and the VirusTotal 
labeling process. All of them suggested a signifcantly faster 
blacklist response time for protecting users more effectively. In 
addition, cybercriminals continue to use evasion techniques to 
make phishing websites remain online so that it is accessible to 
victim users for a long time [28, 29, 47]. These studies imply 
that, as far as the standard anti-phishing defense is operated in 
a reactive manner, phishing attacks will still remain signifcant 
threats to people. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The increased usage of online services during the COVID­
19 pandemic, coupled with users’ fear, has resulted in a spike 
of online social engineering attacks. To gain insight into how 
the pandemic changed trends in phishing and scams and how 
attackers took advantage of this situation, we synthesized 
multiple sources of web-related data. Our analysis revealed the 
potential for new ecosystem defenses and enhanced collabo­
ration among entities to support a more timely and effective 
ecosystem strategy to combat surges in phishing volume.
