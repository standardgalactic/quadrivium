PUBLISHER'S NOTE
In this marvelous collection, drawn from numerous Celtic and Old Norse
sources in the British lsles and Scandinavia, a rich selection of traditional
Christian
and secular designs is brought
together. Some of the meticu-
lously rendered designs were found in iIluminated manuscripts,
missals,
and psalters of the Celtic Church (including
the incomparable
Book of
Kells and the earlier Book of Ourrow) and on Celtic stone crosses. Others
are from runic inscriptionson
stones, Norse sword hilts and personal
ornaments,
and the decoration
of everyday
artifacts such as bedposts,
horse collars, and weather vanes. The sources of the designs are in lreland;
Scotland; Wales; Cornwall,
Cumbria, Gloucestershire,
Northumberland,
Sutton
Hoo (in Suffolk), and the lsle of Man in England;
Denmark;
Norway; and Sweden.
Created
in the period
from the 6th century to the 12th century
A.D.
(some of them during the 9th and 10th centuries, at the height of the Norse
invasions
and occupations
of large areas of England and lreland),
the
designs
represent
the six major periods
of Old Norse decoration:
the
Broa/Oseberg,
Borre, Jellinge, Mammen, Ringerike, and Urnes styles, as
well as many generations
of Celtic Christian ornament, chiefly elabora ted
in lreland and Scotland.
