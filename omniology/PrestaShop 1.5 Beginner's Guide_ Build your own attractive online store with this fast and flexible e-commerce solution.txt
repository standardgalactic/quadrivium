Preface
If you want to start your e-commerce business but are not so much of a technical person, 
then PrestaShop could be your solution because it is an easy, open source, and free-for-use 
software that helps sell your products over the Internet.
PrestaShop is a live software, due for an open source license; there is a big community 
developing new features and fixing bugs very fast.
This book is called a "beginner's guide" only because that is where it starts! Using both 
realistic and unusual case studies throughout, PrestaShop 1.5 Beginner's Guide will take 
you on a click-by-click, yet whirlwind journey to the realization of a fully featured, highly 
professional e-commerce business.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Getting Started, covers how to download and prepare the PrestaShop files, make 
a database, install PrestaShop, and implement post-installation security.
Chapter 2, Back Office, helps you with setting the shape of your store, including the logo. 
We will set up your home page, make some more key pages such as "Contact us" and 
"Conditions of use", and change and customize themes.
Chapter 3, Merchandising for Success, discusses and implements an efficient category 
structure. We will add high quality product descriptions that sell and take a look at all the 
different ways in which you can use PrestaShop to highlight products. We will also take a look 
at product features, attributes, accessories, and customization.
Chapter 4, Getting More Customers, provides information on how to choose the best 
keywords and provide food for the search engines. We will refine PrestaShop search. We will 
also cover tag clouds, how to use the PrestaShop CMS, URLs in PrestaShop, robots and site 
maps, and how to use PrestaShop language features.

Preface
[ 2 ]
Chapter 5, Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics, looks at all of the most useful 
things on the Preferences tab. We will set up a newsletter and notifications system, talk 
about running an e-mail marketing campaign, set up PrestaShop statistics, and also set up 
Google Analytics.
Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery, looks at the ways in which your shop can be 
damaged. We will add users, profiles, and permissions to increase security. We will talk 
about and optionally implement SSL to protect your customers' private information. We will 
learn how to back up and restore your shop in case everything else fails. We will also talk 
about upgrading PrestaShop and how this helps keep your business secure.
Chapter 7, Checkouts and Shipping, helps us choose and set up a payment provider. We 
will take a look at alternative payment methods, sales taxes, discuss and implement gift 
vouchers, and learn how to accept foreign currencies. We will look at the multitude of ways 
in which to set up shipping options for your customers to choose from, and make sure that 
they get charged correctly.
Chapter 8, Ready to Sell, shows us how to create a customer account and place an order. 
We will look at the PrestaShop customer loyalty scheme and at how to get some feedback 
on your products using the PrestaShop Product Comments module. We will tell the search 
engines about your cool new shop. We will also look at a multi-pronged marketing campaign 
that includes vouchers and social media. The last thing we will do is cover some functionality 
of the Customers and Orders tabs that we haven't covered already.
Chapter 9, Go... to the Future, we will cover analyzing, optimizing, and adding to your 
PrestaShop site. We will see "the big secret" and also the future of e-commerce and 
PrestaShop.
Appendix A, Control Panel Quick Reference, briefs you about the tabs and subtabs available in 
PrestaShop.
Appendix B, Web Resources, lists down the web resources to help you build your 
e-commerce business.
What you need for this book
Before you get down to building your PrestaShop store, you will need a localhost or a hosting 
provider to install your own PrestaShop site.

Preface
[ 3 ]
If you already have a web host, here are the system requirements for installing and using 
PrestaShop. Give your host a call if you are unsure; change if they can't accommodate you. 
Most good hosts will be fine, as the requirements are very "normal":


Linux, Unix, or Windows operating system


Apache web server


PHP 5.1 or later versions


MySQL 5.0 or later versions
Some PHP 5 versions are bugged (like 1&1) and prevent PrestaShop from working correctly. 
The following is a list of PHP versions that you should avoid installing for PrestaShop:


PHP 5.2.1 (authentication is impossible)


PHP 5.2.6 (authentication is impossible under 64-bit servers)


PHP 5.2.9 (image management/upload broken)


PHP < 5.2 (invalid date-time zone)
Who this book is for
This book is for anybody who wants to build a fully functional, real e-commerce store using 
PrestaShop. You do not have to have any previous knowledge of PrestaShop or any aspect 
of e-commerce or business in general. If you do, then you will probably find this guide really 
valuable as well. The book covers all you need to know, but you must just bring the desire to

In this book, you will find several headings appearing frequently.
To give clear instructions of how to complete a procedure or task, we use:
Time for action – heading
1.	 Action 1
2.	 Action 2
3.	 Action 3
Instructions often need some extra explanation so that they make sense, so they are 
followed with:

Preface
[ 4 ]
What just happened?
This heading explains the working of tasks or instructions that you have just completed.
You will also find some other learning aids in the book, including:
Pop quiz – heading
These are short multiple-choice questions intended to help you test your own 
understanding.
Have a go hero – heading
These are practical challenges that give you ideas for experimenting with what you  
have learned.
You will also find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of 
information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, 
pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The file 
that we are going to play with is called global.css. It is in the CSS folder inside our main 
template folder."
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in 
menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "On the Select Destination 
Location screen, click on Next to accept the default destination.".
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Know your business
Before you start a business, you have to know the product you are selling. If you are not 
convinced, the buyer themselves may think twice before buying it. Be focused on your 
chosen market and on your target customers. An example of a great e-commerce solution 
is www.amazon.com. Amazon, the biggest e-commerce solution in the world, began selling 
books from a garage with a singular focus on a chosen market and target customer.

Downloading PrestaShop
Visit www.prestashop.com to get your free copy of PrestaShop. Click on the Download 
option. Select your favorite language and click on the big green button Download Now. It 
is optional whether you fill in the very brief registration information. When you click on the 
download button you should have a zipped file called prestashop_1.5.x.x.zip, where 
x.x is the version of PrestaShop you have downloaded. The version number you have 
doesn’t matter. As long as you follow the download link from the PrestaShop home page,  
you will have the latest stable version.
In the next tutorial, we will upload all the loose unzipped files to your web server. It is  
worth pointing out that you might save some time by uploading the zipped file and using 
your web host’s file manager to do the unzipping. As most web hosts use a slightly different 
system, I will guide you through unzipping first. But if you know how to use your web host’s file 
manager to do this, you could save some time while uploading. You decide. Unzip it  
now to prepare for the next guide and you will be left with a folder called prestashop.
Technical requirements
To install PrestaShop on a computer, you will need a prepared package. WAMP for Windows, 
which you can download from www.wampserver.com, or if you are Mac user you could use 
MAMP, which can be downloaded from www.mamp.info. You can also use XAMPP to install 
PrestaShop in a different OS and you can download it from www.apachefriends.org/en/
xampp.html.
To install PrestaShop on the Internet you will need a domain name, a web server like Apache, 
Nginx, or Microsoft IIS with PHP 5.1 or higher installed and enabled, and MySQL 5.0 or higher 
installed with a database created and FTP access.
Now that you have downloaded and unzipped the PrestaShop files, it’s time to put them 
onto your website ready to install. If you are hosting at home, this is a simple matter of 
putting them in the Apache home folder (see my downloadable guide if you’re unsure where 
this is).
If you are developing on a live server, then you need to transfer the files via FTP. Let’s do that 
step-by-step.

Chapter 1
[ 9 ]
Time for action – transferring files to your web host
To make this as quick and easy as it can be, I will use a few Windows shortcuts in this short 
click-by-click guide. Just before you dive in, you will need your FTP username and password. 
If you don’t know it already, you can usually find this quite easily by looking in your account 
details in your web host’s control panel. Any doubts, give them a ring or send an them an 
email – after all, that’s what you pay them for!
1.	 Press the Windows key and tap the E key twice. You will have two Explorer windows 
pop up. Arrange them neatly one above the other. Alternatively, you can grab a copy 
of a dedicated FTP program such as FileZilla from www.sourceforge.net. There 
is a small learning curve doing this, but once you’re used to it, you will have more 
options when using FTP. This guide assumes you do not have FileZilla, but if you do, 
it won’t be a problem to interpret the guide.
2.	 Browse to the unzipped prestashop folder at the bottom of the window and click 
on it. We do not need the folder itself, just the contents.
3.	 At the top window, you need to log into your website via FTP. In the address bar 
at the top of the screen, type ftp://yourdomain.xxx and press Enter. When a 
pop-up window appears, enter your FTP username and password that you obtained 
earlier.
4.	 Now at the bottom of the window, left-click on the very first file. Press the Shift 
key and then, using the down arrow key while still pressing Shift, scroll to the very 
bottom of the screen so that every single file and folder is highlighted.
5.	 Now let go of all the keys on the keyboard. Left-click and hold the left mouse button. 
You can now drag all the files from the prestashop folder on your PC up to your 
website in the top window.
6.	 Wait for the files to upload. The time will vary according to the speed of your 
Internet connection.
What just happened?
What you have done is put all of the files and folders containing the entire computer  
code, data, images, and other resources into your web host’s server, ready for the next  
phase of installation.
So let’s move on.

Getting Started
[ 10 ]
Making a database
PrestaShop needs a MySQL database to function. The files we have just uploaded are the 
web pages that will become your store and the PHP programming code that performs the 
actions required by your store.
For example, when a customer creates an account in your new shop, the programming  
code contained in the files that we uploaded will fill out and store the information in a 
completely separate computer program. This program is called a database server and the 
type of database server that PrestaShop uses is called MySQL. Usually, when you are  
pro-hosting, this server will be an entirely different physical computer to the one holding 
your files (the web server). As with many servers/computer programs, you need a username 
and password to access its functions. You also need a unique name for a database for your 
shop on that server, and you need to know the address locating the server. As an example, 
this could be mysql.yourdomain.xxx. Or it could be something completely different.
Now many web hosts will have already allocated database server details to your hosting 
account. If this is the case, then you only need to find them and make a note of them for  
the next phase of the installation.
Most likely your web hosts have a simple two-or three-click process for creating a database. 
You can then access the details of this newly created database in order to proceed.
Precise details will vary from host to host and also the order in which the options are 
presented (if at all). The database creation process goes like this.
If you already have a created database, that is okay. PrestaShop can function on a database 
used by other applications. However, to make sure that they do not conflict, or worse, 
damage each other, pay close attention to the How to install PrestaShop section to be sure of 
how to create a table prefix!
Time for action – creating a database
First of all, you need to log in to your hosting control panel. You are looking for an option 
called MySQL, MySQL databases, phpMyAdmin, or perhaps just Databases.
1.	 Click on MySQL databases or something named as Databases.
2.	 Now we need to make another database. Look for the option Create new, Make a 
database, or perhaps just Add. Click on it to see the options presented. The following 
is a screenshot of the database creation page on the DreamHost.com control panel. 
It serves as a good example because it has more options than most. If your screen has 
fewer options, that is okay. Just follow the guide for the bits you need.

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Database Name is an important detail that needs to be remembered. It is case 
sensitive, so upper and lower case must be accurately recorded. Choose a name; 
again, it is arbitrary, but use something appropriate and not easily guessable, like 
mydomainsomesecretnumber. There will be a maximum number of characters, so 
you might need to use a shortened version. Write it down or copy and paste it into 
Windows Notepad or on a similar application. It is possible that you do not have a 
field for a name or it has already been filled out automatically. That’s fine. Just write 
it down.
3.	 Enter a memorable but unguessable password. Again this might be decided for you 
and it might not have this option at all. Re-enter the password if required. Write it 
down or copy and paste it in the Notepad or something similar.
4.	 If you get the choice to select versions for MySQL, tick/check the option for 5 or 
later.
5.	 If you get the option to Allow Direct Database Access, this is a definite No. We don’t 
want people to fiddle with our database from far away.
6.	 When you’re done, click to create the database— OK, Finish, Create, Add new 
database now, or whatever your web host decides to label their button with.
7.	 Now you should be able to see a summary of the database you created. Complete 
with the values you chose and the values chosen for you. As usual, write it all down 
or copy and paste it into Notepad or some similar application.

[ 12 ]
What just happened?
Now we have a fresh database just itching to be filled up and manipulated. We also have the 
database information we need to do so. Now we go to the most interesting part of the process 
and get our very first glimpse of PrestaShop in action. We’ll set up the program right away.
How to install PrestaShop
Now for the fun part, when you get to see some results. What we are going to do is run the 
PrestaShop auto-installer. This will be a series of web pages where you will enter information 
to allow the auto-installer to configure your store.
The sort of information that we will be entering is business information such as your shop 
name, personal details, and of course the database information gathered previously.
Time for action – the PrestaShop auto-installer
To get started, type your shop domain name into your web browser. It will automatically 
redirect you to the default start of the PrestaShop installation program. You should then 
perform the following steps:
1.	 First, just choose your language and tick on the licenses agreement. Then click 
on Next to move to the System Compatibility screen as shown in the following 
screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
2.	 Check that you have all green ticks in PHP parameters and Write permissions on files, 
as in the preceding screenshot. On the Optional set-up you can have some crosses, 
but they are not obligatory. If you do, then click on Next to proceed and jump to the 
next step. If you see some scary red crosses, don’t panic because there are some 
simple solutions here. If you have all green ticks move on to step number 6.

Getting Started
[ 14 ]
3.	 If you have any red crosses under the PHP settings, then you need to contact your 
web host and ask them to make some changes for you. If your hosting package has 
the system requirements discussed earlier, it is most unlikely you have any crosses 
here. Also, if you have installed hosting on your own PC, they will all be ticks. If you 
have crosses and need to contact your web host, then read the next point first.
4.	 The next is Write permissions on files. This is the most likely area to have some 
crosses and also has the easiest remedy. In order for PrestaShop to install itself, it 
needs to modify (write to) various files and folders. A red cross indicates that the 
folder cannot be written to. Changing this is nice and easy. Log in to your website 
with FTP just as we did when we transferred the PrestaShop folders there. Locate 
any folders with a red cross, right-click on them, and select Properties. Then put 
a tick in the top two checkboxes under the Write column. Done! It is possible that 
you might need to use your web host’s file manager to do this step. Also, if you 
extracted the files on your web server, then the file permissions will probably not 
need amending at all. The last optional settings are just that, entirely optional. And 
again if you are pro-hosting, your web host will need to resolve this for you, but 
PrestaShop will still be functional without them.
5.	 Click on the Refresh these settings button to check if you have solved the 
problem(s) and then click on Next and read on.
6.	 The next is the System Configuration screen:

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]

Getting Started
[ 16 ]
7.	 You might have probably guessed that this is where you will fill in all the database 
information that we collected earlier. I will go through each setting one at a time 
because some of the fields are described differently from host to host and by 
PrestaShop. I feel the need for a small table of explanations. Here it is:
PrestaShop field
Explanation/alternative name
Database server 
address
This is the address of computer (server) with your database on it: 
Sometimes called “address”, “host name”, or just “database server”.
Type this in here exactly as it appears in your web hosting control 
panel. It could be something like mysql.yourdomain.xxx.
Database name
This is simply a name given to the database on the database server: 
On shared hosting environments, this is often the same thing as the 
username (or login as PrestaShop calls it).
Enter exactly as it appears in your hosting control panel.
Login
Your MySQL username: On shared hosting environments, this is often 
the same as database name. 
Enter exactly as it appears in your hosting control panel.
Password
Your top secret sequence of letters and numbers (Shhh…).
Database Engine
This is the way to store your data in your database. You will see a 
drop-down menu with two options: InnoDB and MyISAM.
InnoDB is the default storage engine for MySQL and MyISAM was the 
default storage engine for MySQL.
Here select InnoDB, but if your hosting does not have this option, 
then you will need to use MyISAM.
Tables prefix:
This is a short series of letters placed before all the tables (sections) 
of your soon-to-be-created database. When an e-commerce shop 
of any type is created, there are dozens of tables created to store all 
the necessary information. If you think about it, all stores are likely to 
have similar table names (perhaps “customers” or “products”). When 
this occurs, adding a unique prefix prevents the new table destroying 
the old.
A prefix is a good idea at any time, a very good idea if you have any 
other uses for your database and essential one if you have more than 
one PrestaShop on your database.
If this is your first PrestaShop, I suggest leaving the prefix as it is, that 
is ps_. But if this is your second or third, I suggest changing it to 
ps2_ or ps3_.

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
Now click on the button Verify now! If everything goes smoothly you will see the following 
message: Database is connected. If not, please review all the fields and check it with your 
hosting provider.
1.	 Leave the Configure SMTP manually box unchecked. This is unnecessary for a pro-
hosted environment. Then click on Next.
2.	 Enter your preferred e-mail address on your shop’s domain that you would  
like PrestaShop to use. PrestaShop will send e-mails to customers to thank them  
for orders, notify them of dispatch, and more. PrestaShop will also contact you to  
let you know about important events such as when people spend money!
3.	 Click on Next and your shop database will be made. You will see the following 
screenshot:

Getting Started
[ 18 ]
4.	 This page is really simple but with a little twist. Just fill in your Shop name and 
select the Main Activity as you like. As a piece of advice select Yes for Install demo 
products. Now select the country where your shop is based and its time zone. You 
can upload your Shop logo later, but if you want to do it now, you have to upload 
a 209 x 52 pixel graphic logo from your PC. To log in to your admin control panel 
use first and the last names along with the email and password. Do not select the 
Receive this information by e-mail checkbox, as we will enable this later. Click on 
Next and rejoice.
What just happened?
You have just made your first PrestaShop. Cool! A few more bits and pieces to fiddle with 
and you’re done. Was that difficult? In my opinion, if there is a technical side to running a 
PrestaShop e-commerce business, then that was probably about as geeky and technical as it 
gets! If you are reading this, you are heading for success.
Post-install security
Just a few, very quick modifications to your PrestaShop files and it’s done.
Deleting the install folder
What we need to do is delete the entire folder called install from your web server. The 
reason for this is that it contains the PHP code that configured your store. So it might be 
very easy for anybody who knows it is there to rerun the install process with erroneous 
information and mess up your store.
Time for action – how to delete the install folder
This is probably the quickest and easiest way to do it:
1.	 Press the Windows key and hit E once. This will bring up a new Explorer window.
2.	 In the address bar, type ftp://yourdomain.com and hit Enter/Return.
3.	 Enter your FTP username and password.
4.	 Find the install folder. It is nice and prominent, near the top, under the  
img folder.
5.	 Right-click on it and select Delete. That’s it. Don’t close the FTP window, and  
read on.

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
What just happened?
Without the PrestaShop installation files, nobody can run the installation process again. So we 
just prevented anyone with a little bit of knowledge from reinstalling over our PrestaShop and 
causing us to have a bad day. Next we will take another precaution to protect our new shop.
Renaming the admin folder
The admin folder holds all the web pages and PHP code that allows you to manage your 
shop. Almost any customization or configuration that you will make using your control panel, 
including the ability to log in, relies on this folder and the knowledge of its location. So you 
obviously you don’t want any Tom, Dick, and Harry sitting on their PC at www.yourdomain.
com/admin trying to guess your password. And anybody who knows anything about 
e-commerce software knows that the default folder name for such functions is often admin. 
So we will now name it something more secret and personal.
Time for action – renaming the admin folder
You should already have an FTP window to perform these steps. If not, repeat steps 1 to 3 in 
the previous Time for action section and then come back here:
1.	 Find the admin folder.
2.	 Right-click on it and select Rename.
3.	 Rename it something that is easy to remember but difficult to guess. 
I suggest treating your admin folder name like a password. Perhaps, 
admintrickypassword. Make sure to leave the admin folder bit at the start. Then 
it would be safe from prying eyes and tampering fingers, but you and the PrestaShop 
system will know where it is.
4.	 Close your FTP window.
What just happened?
You just made your store’s control panel practically inaccessible to anybody except you.

Your shop front explained
Now, at last, it is time to see your shop! Visit www.yourdomain.com. It should look like the 
following screenshot:
If you haven’t already done this, then go and have a look at a PrestaShop that has some 
content. This will help you visualize approximately how your own store will take shape.  
You can do this at http://demo-store.prestashop.com/en/.

[ 21 ]
Now you can see the logo of your shop, a search bar, useful links such as contact, sitemap,  
or bookmark, select the Currency option, a Log in link, and the main menu in the top area  
of a website.
The following screenshot is the header. The header is the top area in a website:
On both sides of the web we have columns. On the left side, we have the main navigation.
On the right column, we have specials offers, latest products, and some information about 
your store.
In the middle of the website, we have the products. On the homepage there are featured 
products and one carousel, but when we surf along the categories, we see a list of products 
that belong to that category. When we click on a product, we have all the information about 
that product in this area.
The latest part of this area is called the footer. We have useful links and contact details in this 
area, as shown in the following screenshot:

But if you see the following screenshot, you need to go back the Post-install security section.
Time for action – logging in to your PrestaShop control panel
Here is how to get there:
1.	 In your web browser type www.yourdomain.com/youradminfoldername, where 
youradminfoldername is the same name that you chose for your admin folder 
previously.
2.	 Enter the e-mail address you registered with and the password you gave on the last 
configuration page, when you installed PrestaShop.

4.	 Why don’t you have a look at the PrestaShop live feed? This contains topical news 
and information about PrestaShop direct from the creators. If there is an update 
available for PrestaShop, you will hear about it here.
What just happened?
You took your first look inside your store control panel. Now let’s click some buttons.
Control panel guided tour
Here I will quickly run through some of the general functions contained within each tab and 
drop-down box. I shall also mention the chapters in which we will cover them in more detail. 
Why not explore as we run through them? A full control panel reference is contained in 
Appendix 1, Control Panel Quick Reference. From left to right, we have:


Catalog: On this tab we have everything we need to manage our product range 
and all related aspects. For example, as well as creating the products themselves 
(Chapter 3, Merchandising for Success), we can also give our customers 
manufacturer and supplier information to aid their buying decision (Chapter 2, The 
Back Office). We can assign advanced features to our catalog such as attributes, 
features, customizations, and attachments (Chapter 3, Merchandising for Success). 
We can also assign product tags to help customers and search engines easily find 
what they want (Chapter 4, Getting More Customers).


Orders: Here we can manage every aspect of post-purchase communication such as 
notifying customers of dispatch or a problem, making invoices available, and printing 
packing slips. All of this will be covered in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.


Customers: The Customers tab allows us to view and edit our list of customers as 
well as creating groups of different types of customers. This, as we know, can be 
very useful (Chapter 8, Ready to Sell).


Price Rules: This tab lets us customize your customers experience. Here we can 
create discounts for specific carriers, products, suppliers, categories, manufacturers, 
combinations, or offer free shipping. It also lets us create and manage gift vouchers 
that can be purchased (Chapter 7, Checkouts and Shipping) or given away as a 
promotion (Chapter 8, Ready to Sell).


Shipping: Unfortunately, this tab can’t actually deliver stuff for you. It does 
everything that is related to delivering your customers’ orders. You can configure 
shipping types, costs, and durations in any combination to suit your business 
(Chapter 7, Checkouts and Shipping).


Localization: Here we can set up our shop for different languages, zones, countries 
that we deliver, states, currencies, taxes and tax rules, and translations. We will also 
go into depth in Chapter 7, Checkouts and Shipping.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]


Modules: Everything in PrestaShop is about module. If you put a shopping basket 
here, it’s a module; if you put a menu there, it’s a module. We will be in and out  
of the Modules tab all the time. We will also go into greater depth about modules  
in (Chapter 2, The Back Office and Chapter 5, Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income,  
and Statistics).


Preferences: This is the second most varied tab in the whole of PrestaShop. There 
are many things you can do here. We will be popping in here from time to time and 
then covering everything we missed (Chapter 5, Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, 
and Statistics).


Advanced Parameters: Here we can check and set up different performances for 
our shop such as, cache, database backups, and logs (Chapter 5, Tools, Newsletters, 
Extra Income, and Statistics and Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery).


Administration: We manage our preferences, add, edit or delete employees, set up 
profiles, and permissions (Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery).


Stats: This topic is crucial. It is a very significant area where PrestaShop stands head 
and shoulders above its competitors. Capturing and using statistics (Chapter 5, Tools, 
Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics) will allow you to measure success and 
decide how to change and improve your shop (Chapter 9, Go… To the Future).
Have a go hero – hunt the PrestaShop thimble
Here is a little challenge for you. Nothing very technical but a sort of PrestaShop “hunt the 
thimble”. What if you wanted to temporarily disable your shop? Maybe you wanted to close 
it for maintenance. Perhaps you want to close it down during development when you’re not 
actually viewing it. Can you find where to do it?
I promise you the solution is simple. But can you find out where is it hiding?
Solution: Click on the Preferences tab. Scroll down to Maintenance and select No. The 
Maintenance IP box even enables you to enter your unique Internet (IP) address so that only 
you can see the shop. This is a perfect, secure manner to develop your store. To get your IP 
address visit http://www.whatsmyip.org/. Enter it in the box on your Preferences tab 
and click on Save.
Before we continue
It is not important to know where everything is and how it works at this stage. As I 
mentioned before, we will approach each topic in the likely order of setting up a new 
business and not in a left-to-right manner. I just thought it might be nice to have a look  
under the hood before we get stuck in! This will hopefully help you to master PrestaShop 
more logically and to achieve my 7-day challenge.

Pop quiz – a few questions about Chapter 1
Q1. Many web hosts charge per database or have a limit before forcing you to upgrade your 
package. How would you create almost unlimited PrestaShop installations on the same 
domain name and same database without overwriting the original?
1.	 Upgrading your web host package
2.	 Enable multistore

Summary
We learned a lot in this chapter about PrestaShop.
Specifically, we covered the following:


Obtaining PrestaShop: Where to download it from and how to prepare the files, 
including how to transfer them via FTP to your website.


MySQL databases: How PrestaShop uses the database, how to create a MySQL 
database, and how the different terms are used to refer to the database location.


PrestaShop installer: How to complete each step of the installer and filling out the 
slightly trickier pages like the database configuration page, and how to get around 
an intermittent bug in the installer.


The shop front: How to refer to different parts of the shop front.


The shop back: A brief look at where the different functions and tasks can be 
performed.
We’re now ready to fit your shop with a visually pleasing, unique, and sales-efficient design. 
This is the topic of the next chapter. So let’s get stuck in!

Back Office
Your shop front, as it stands, is quite bland. But in about 20 pages time it will 
be bristling with modules, search boxes, navigation boxes, a smart header, and 
much more.
In this chapter, we will:


Set the shape of your store including the logo


Build your home page


Populate key website pages such as the contact us and conditions of use pages


Configure manufacturer and supplier information


Change and customize themes


Add a few more touches to your shop’s configuration
So let’s get on with it...

Dashboard
Dashboard is the landing page you get to when you log in to your back office. Here, you 
can take a quick look about your shop activity, customer services, statistics, configuration 
checklist, PrestaShop news and links, and quick links to different sections on the Web such  
as Products sold recently, new orders, or new products.
Catalog
This section contains all the content that you want to sell to your customer. The Products 
subsection contains all the items that are in your store. The Categories subsection is the 
easiest way to keep a tidy store; to make it easier for our customers to find our products, we 
split our products into different categories. In the Monitoring section, we can track multiple 
issues of concern in your product inventory. Attributes and Values is the area where you can 
set up new attributes for your products, such as color, size, and so on. Features can relate 
to physical dimensions or other characteristics of the product. Manufacturers is the section 
where we add the companies that make a particular product. The Suppliers section contains 
the information that can help us get more products. Image Mapping is used to create a 
hotspot on an image. The Tags section is used for assigning short descriptions (tags) to the 
products. Sometimes, you may need to provide a file (such as a manual or software) as part 
of the product; this can be done in the Attachments section.

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
Orders
This is the best part of an e-commerce shop; you will be able to see all the orders and 
everything that you sold. Also, this section will contain invoices, merchandise returns, 
delivery slips, credit slips, statuses, and order messages.
Customers
Every customer or person that signed up will be shown in this section. Here you can check all 
the information about our clients. You may also split your customers in different groups, such 
as a VIP group, to offer different discounts or different products.
If any of your customers did not check out, you can see what they have in their shopping cart.
In this section, we will set up and detail the information on customer services and contacts. 
This is very important because if you take care of your clients, the clients speak well about 
your store, and that is the best publicity you can get for your shop.
Price rules
This section could be one of our clients’ favorites because this is where the vouchers and 
discounts for your clients are listed.
Shipping and localization
If the products that you are selling are digital, then this section is not for you. In this section, 
we will set up the pricing, rules, and carriers to deliver your products.
Under localization, you can set up the different languages that you would like to offer on 
your website, all the countries that you want to sell your products to, taxes, and currencies.
Modules
This is one of the most important sections on your site because this is where all the 
functionality and design is. For that, we will cover this section in detail.
Arranging key modules
What is a module? A module is an independent widget that you can add to your e-commerce 
website. The best way of demonstrating this is to get on and do something.

First, I will list the key PrestaShop modules and their uses. I will then go through them step 
by step, enabling, configuring (whenever necessary), and positioning them. I will also suggest 
positions for the modules and give reasons for my suggestions.
It is important to remember that everyone’s shop has varying objectives and it is perfectly 
reasonable, maybe even likely, that you would want to discard some of my suggestions. This 
is good, and if you feel like you know best after having read my suggestions and reasons, 
then you probably do know best. It’s your shop, and that is the whole point of the flexibility 
of PrestaShop; every shop should be unique. There is no better option.
The following screenshot shows the Modules tab in your control panel:
Take a look at the screenshot or click on the Modules tab in your PrestaShop control panel. 
On the left, we have a list of modules divided into categories; on the right, we have a list with 
the description and status of all the modules (installed or not installed) in our shop.

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
There are dozens of modules. We are just going to look at the most common or key examples. 
There are some key modules, such as payment modules (quite important for a shop), which we 
will skip now and deal with later in a specific section that deals with payment.
I will go into click-by-click detail in the Time for action section for the first module. I will 
go into the same level of detail whenever there is anything new or different, like when 
configuration options are required. But if the setup of a module is closely identical to a 
previous one, I will just point this out. You can then refer to a previous Time for action 
tutorial or set it up from memory. So let’s get on with it.
Cart block
Every self-respecting shop has a shopping cart. It is a part of the web page that summarizes 
the customer’s current situation with regard to product choices. It will show an abbreviated 
list of all the items selected for possible purchase as well as the total amount of money due 
so far. I had said that I would make suggestions about the likely use of the different modules 
and I cannot think of any good reason why a shop would not display this particular module.
I would also suggest that it should be made highly prominent. Its very presence alerts visitors 
to the fact that you are a shop and not just an information website. Its effect is very similar 
to the physiological effect of a “real” shopping cart. If you haven’t got one, you can’t put 
anything in it!
Why not check a few of the major online retailers and see what they do with their shopping 
cart? Many, if not most, have it in the top or right-hand side column near the top. This is how 
I will show you how to position yours.
Time for action – installing the shopping cart module
We are now going to create a shopping cart module:
1.	 Log in to your PrestaShop control panel and click on the Modules tab. You should 
see the same window that you saw in the previous screenshot.
2.	 When you scroll down the list of modules, you will see the Cart block module. Just 
to the right of the description, click on the Install button (it is installed by default).
3.	 Now scroll back to the Cart block module. Notice the word in green. Click on 
Configure.
4.	 Here you have the option to select an Ajax cart. AJAX is a suite of technologies that 
enables some really cool and smooth web effects. Sounds like a good idea? Thought 
so. The reason you have the option to switch AJAX off is that some older templates 
that we will look at later in this chapter do not get along with AJAX, so you will need to 
switch it off. For now at least, I suggest leaving it on. Click on Save when you’re ready.

[ 34 ]
5.	 Go and have a look at your shop front. You should see a page similar to the one 
shown in the following screenshot. Why not click on the Cart and Check out buttons 
to see the effect? It is a good idea to understand the experience that your customers 
will get.
What just happened?
Congratulations! The first of your many modules has been enabled.
What goes on your home page?
First let’s discuss what goes on the home page and then it’s time for action to actually add 
your new content to the home page.
Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
Every business should have a USP, that is, a reason in the form of a statement that compels 
customers to stick around and spend money at your shop. It is this USP that is a viable option 
to be displayed right at the top of your home page. So how do you decide on one?
You need to think about your business and your products. What makes you different and 
unique? What is your “thing” that people can buy, which is so brilliant that they would  
want to find out more? By “thing” I don’t mean a product, I mean a benefit that a key 
product or range from your shop gives your customers (selling) and how you present it to 
them (the proposition).
Let’s look at an example. How many shops sell teddy bears? There is probably a multitude  
of shops selling teddies. So a half-hearted “Welcome to my shop. We sell teddy bears, and 
we really look after our customers”, although sincere, won’t sell much fluff!
But if I think about what is unique and will benefit my customers, I will start making some 
progress. I sell teddies, and they are fluffy. So how fluffy are they? I happen to know that 
they are really fluffy. In fact, I can’t remember ever hugging a teddy that was fluffier. But is 
fluffiness really a benefit to my customer? Who shops on my site? It is not three-year olds 
with Visa and American Express. No, they are mums and dads. So what benefit do mums  
and dads get from my products? They want a happy, secure, and safe little toddler who has  
a teddy bear that he/she really loves that didn’t break the bank.

Chapter 2
[ 35 ]
How about this: “At Fluffyteddies.com, all our bears are made from the perfect mix of 
natural and man-made fibers to guarantee that your special little one feels snuggled and 
loved by their new bear. And because we specialize only in bears and the like, we are never 
beaten on price.”
A good USP is often made from a mixture of key facts, emotive reassurances, and a 
guarantee. Your USP could be much shorter: “The crumbliest, flakiest milk chocolate in the 
world” or “The softest, most huggable teddy bear at the picnic!”; it could also be much 
longer. What’s important is that it is not just a greeting or a statement with facts, and it 
specifically reveals certain benefits to the purchaser.
Time for action – how to add your content to your home page
PrestaShop has a really easy-to-use CMS. CMS is an acronym for Content Management System. 
It will allow you to create and label content and then enable links to it. We will see more of this 
when we create your “must have” pages, in a minute, and when we look at the CMS in more 
depth in Chapter 4, Getting More Customers. PrestaShop deals with home page content in a 
slightly different way. It uses another module called the Home text editor. Here goes:
1.	 Click on the Modules tab and scroll down, find the Image slider for your homepage 
module, and click on Install (by default, it is installed).
2.	 Now come back to it again and click on Configure. I have divided the page that you will 
see into two screenshots, one for the back office and the other for the home page.

Back Office
[ 36 ]
The following is a screenshot of your home page with a new slider:
3.	 Now visit your store’s home page. This will show you what the default content in the 
Image slider for your homepage module is. This will make it much easier to follow 
when we change it all next.
4.	 Click on Slides configuration and then click on Add Slide.

Chapter 2
[ 37 ]
5.	 Select the image that you want to display on your home page. Give it a title using 
the Title field, a link in the URL field, and a small brief in the Legend field. If you 
want to write something longer, then you can do this using the Description field. 
The last option here is, whether you want it to be active or not. This is very helpful 
when you are doing the campaign of a product and you do not want to show any 
more in the homepage. Remember, the fields file, title, URL and legend are required.
6.	 Click on Save and you will have a nice image in the home page slider.
7.	 Now we know how to add a new image to the slider, but to know everything about 
the Image slider for your homepage module, I am going to dig deeper into the slider 
configuration. This section is used to set the size of the images on our homepage. 
By default, the size is perfect for the default theme, but if you change your theme in 
the future (we will see how to do this in this chapter), you might need to change the 
size to fit the new design. Also, we can change the transition speed between images 
and the duration of time for which they will be paused. For that we have the fields, 
Speed and Pause; both numbers have to be in milliseconds. The last field in this area 
is Loop. If the loop option is on, all the images will show automatically, but if it is off, 
the customer will need to use slider navigation.

[ 38 ]
8.	 When you are happy with the configuration, click on Save and check whether your 
home page looks the way you want it to. Make corrections to this (if any) and then 
repeat this step until you are satisfied.
What just happened?
You now have the most prominent page of your website. Take a look at your home page. It’s 
coming together nicely, I think. Remember that you can and should update this page as and 
when it is relevant to do so.
With PrestaShop CMS, you can create your “must have” pages, such as the About us, Terms 
and conditions of use, or Secure payment pages.
Secure payment
Secure payment is a guarantee for your clients that everything that they buy in your shop 
is safe to be paid for online. For that, it is essential for your shop to have secure payment 
modes and to display them on the website.
Time for action – using the content management system
Having decided upon the text for all of your pages, it is time to actually create them.
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab, and then click on CMS.
2.	 From the list of pages, click on the first one that you would like to edit. The Edit 
button is the one with the little pencil and paper picture in the middle of the three 
icons to the right.
3.	 Type in or copy and paste your content. Click on the Save button when done. One 
tip, if you decide to copy and paste from Microsoft Word or similar software, is to 
first paste the content in Notepad to clear Word formatting tags.
4.	 Repeat this procedure for each page. Notice that there is a little bin icon next to the 
edit icon. You can delete a page if you feel you do not need it. For example, many 
stores combine their terms and conditions with their legal notice.
5.	 Visit all your new pages to make sure that they are formatted as you want them  
to be.

Chapter 2
[ 39 ]
What just happened?
The “must have” pages are hardly the most exciting pages of your shop to be created. 
However, they are really important. And once they are done, you can usually leave them 
alone and get on to more exciting things! Next we will learn how to move modules around 
our store. Read on.
Moving modules around
No technical jiggery-pokery required here. PrestaShop allows you to move modules around 
at will and decides whether there are any pages on which a module should not appear. Here 
is a lightning guide for doing just that.
Time for action – moving modules
Make sure that you are logged into your PrestaShop control panel and then follow these 
steps:
1.	 Hover over the Modules tab and then click on the Positions subtab.
2.	 Click on the Transplant a module link.

Back Office
[ 40 ]
3.	 Select the module that you would like to move in the first drop-down box at the top 
of the page, and then select the location you would like to move it to in the second 
one.
4.	 Now specify a list of any pages that you don’t want the module to appear on (if any).
5.	 Click on Save.
6.	 Notice that the module appears twice, in the original position and the new one. If 
this is not the effect you desire, simply go back to your module positions page and 
click on the bin icon next to the one you don’t want anymore.
7.	 Now you are back to the main Positions page. You can scroll down to the position 
you just moved a module to, and using the up and down arrow keys, raise or lower 
the position it appears in. You can also drag-and-drop the modules.
What just happened?
Almost any module can go anywhere now. As usual, my recommendation is to do one 
change at a time because everything all at once might not work or look good together.
Preferences
The Preferences tab has everything you need to customize your shop in different ways. You 
will find the following subsections under the Preferences tab:


In the General subsection, we can set up security specifications such as the option 
to use the HTTPS protocol.


The Orders preferences subsection can be used to set up a minimum purchase 
amount, enable guest checkout, and offer a gift-wrapping, among others.


In the Products preferences subsection, you can choose to make certain products 
in your shop unavailable for sale. This is very useful when you need to do some 
restocking of your products or if you need to do maintenance. Also, here you can set 
up the number of products that you would like to show per page.


Under the Customers preferences subsection, you can choose to show the last 
shopping cart to your customers or to regenerate password to have a security 
minimum time.


The next subsection under the Preferences tab is Themes; we will dig deeper into 
this section later.


In the SEO & URLs subsection, we can check for and set up search-friendly URLs and 
titles for our main pages.

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
The sizes of default images such as categories, products, scenes, and more can be defined by 
you. This is a really easy way to add more uniqueness to your shop. Also, you can create some 
great layouts and enhance your chosen template with just a few well-chosen dimensions.
Time for action – changing the default image size
This is really easy to do. The trick to achieving something unique here is to experiment. Try 
some really big sizes and consider decreasing the number of products per page at the same 
time, especially if you have a small niche range or sell products with interesting or detailed 
images. Here is how:
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab and then click on the Images subtab. Notice that 
you can change the size of just about any image. This is really flexible and useful. Try 
experimenting with different image types.
2.	 Click on the Edit button next to whichever image you are going to mess with and 
enter your new size. Be daring, you can always change it back. Click on Save when 
you are done.
3.	 Now scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Regenerate thumbnails. Go and 
have a look at your products. Some of the images might need to be edited in your 
CSS file, and for some you will see the change right away.
4.	 Now, we can also reduce the number of products per page (if necessary). Hover 
over the Preferences tab and then click on the Products subtab. Scroll down to the 
Products per page field and enter the number you want.
5.	 Go and have a look at the result. Repeat the steps and tweak it until you feel it  
is unique.
What just happened?
You can now vary the image sizes in your store. If doing so improves the look of your shop, 
make sure you use images that look good in their new size.
Now we can go on to explore and discuss key aspects of PrestaShop.
PrestaShop themes
Themes are what distinguish one PrestaShop-powered store from another. They define  
the color, graphics, and even the actual ambience of your store. For example, if you are 
running a shop selling guns, you will want a very different theme compared to the one  
selling teddy bears.

[ 42 ]
Themes are readily available for PrestaShop—many are free and many are not. What follows 
is a low down on where and how to find a theme for your shop. In my view, getting the right 
theme is only the beginning of creating the perfect look for your e-commerce establishment.
I strongly recommend hunting high and low for the theme that most closely suits your 
purposes and then installing it. All this is covered here and now. I also suggest, once you 
are up and running, that you embark on a process of further customization. This will truly 
separate your store from everyone else’s and, along with all the other elements discussed in 
this book, leave you with an absolutely unique store.
The process of template customization is a bit more advanced than simply choosing and 
installing a ready-made template; we will explore the basics in a bit. It has to be said, 
however, that you might be completely happy without customizing. I have a real shop with 
the regular PrestaShop theme and it does just fine.
Let’s get on with finding and installing a great template.
Finding themes
First of all, you need to have plenty of great themes to choose from. Visit http://addons.
prestashop.com/en/3-templates-prestashop to find a list of great resources.
Choosing a great theme
Now here is how to pick a great one. If you visit one of the theme (template) resources 
listed on http://addons.prestashop.com/en/3-templates-prestashop, you 
can find some really sleek-looking templates. Very often, these will require an additional 
configuration change (as well as uploading files), which will all be covered in a bit.
Here is a quick word of warning when you’re choosing a new template, especially when 
you’re paying for it. Look at the substance of the layout and not just the images used for 
display in the template. Remember that, most probably, every single image that you see 
on the demo site will need replacing! Think about how cool it will look with your images 
instead. Is the template you are thinking of buying truly beautiful, or is it just the images  
that look good?
Installing a template takes only a couple of minutes, so try as many free ones as you like,  
and consider the advice I’ve given you carefully before getting your wallet out.
When you have found a truly beautiful theme and you are ready to try it out, read on. Also, 
remember that these days, a lot of people use their mobile and tablet to check a website,  
for that you will need to decide if you want your store to be deployable on more devices.

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
Installing the themes
As I had mentioned before, installing a theme is nice and easy. It’s choosing a theme that is 
the hard part.
Time for action – installing a PrestaShop theme
Here’s how to do it:
1.	 Download the template to your PC.
2.	 Hold down the Windows key and tap the E key twice. In one window, browse to your 
downloaded theme. In the other window, log in to your website via FTP.
3.	 On your website, browse to the themes folder.
4.	 Drag the new themes folder onto your website.
5.	 Now log in to your PrestaShop admin panel.
6.	 Click on the Preferences tab, and then on Appearance. Scroll to the bottom of the 
page, select your new template, and click on Save. How quick was that?
What just happened?
You can now switch themes at will. After this quick pop quiz, we will look at making your 
theme completely unique.
Pop quiz – themes and things
So how do you customize the theme? Maybe you like the general layout but want to change 
some elements?
Q1. How do you think you can change the elements of the actual template itself? (Here’s a 
clue: it’s not in your control panel.)
1.	 By going to the Modules section and then clicking on Featured Products on the 
homepage.
2.	 By editing the HTML template with CSS and JavaScript.
3.	 By going to the Modules section, then selecting Modules & Themes Catalog.
Q2. How do you change the background color?
1.	 By editing the CSS file of the theme.
2.	 By editing the JavaScript file of the theme.

Back Office
[ 44 ]
Q3. How do you change the default images of your new template?
1.	 By clicking on the Themes subtab under Preferences and then selecting your logo.
2.	 By editing the CSS file of the theme.
3.	 By downloading an external module for it.
Customizing your template
Here, as the heading suggests, we will look at customizing our chosen template. Creating a 
template from scratch is too in-depth for the space we have here and involves a skill I am 
not qualified to teach. The skill I am referring to is design. “Click here”, “Click there” type 
of instructions don’t help when trying to design something. If you really want to start from 
scratch, I would recommend you to get two kinds of books: the first on CSS, and another on 
design and layout principles.
The beauty of customizing an existing template is that all the tricky coding has been done 
for us; all we need to do is identify key elements of somebody else’s work and make 
amendments to it. We can then choose a template whose overall shape and style we like, 
and use it as a starting point; we can change it in subtle or not so subtle ways to better suit 
our business and to make sure that our website is unique.
Now we will look at some “quick wins” for simple customization, then the PrestaShop 
template, and then discuss changing the CSS code that defines a template.
To do all this, I will be working with the default PrestaShop template, but everything I talk 
about should be just as relevant, regardless of your chosen template. So let’s get on with it.
Important preliminary point
Throughout this part of the chapter, I will be making suggestions for you to change this and 
that, delete this, add that. It is very possible that it could all go horribly wrong. Therefore, 
you could be left with a template and a shop that doesn’t work. Make sure you have a 
current backup of every file you alter and only make one change at a time, check the effect, 
and then move on. You have been warned!

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
Time for action – creating a new template
It’s really easy to create a new template. The trick to achieving something unique here 
is to experiment. Try some really big sizes and perhaps consider decreasing the number 
of products per page at the same time, especially if you have a small niche range or sell 
products with interesting or detailed images. Here’s how:
1.	 Open an FTP window on your web host.
2.	 Click on the themes directory in the main prestashop folder. Drag a copy of 
the folder you want to copy onto your desktop. If you’re working with the default 
theme, the folder is called prestashop.
3.	 Now right-click on the folder on your desktop and select Rename. Rename the 
folder to whatever you want your new theme to be called (no spaces and all lower 
case is the best convention).
4.	 Drag the new folder onto your web server. You now have a new theme. You can use 
FileZilla to connect to your host; it is an open source software like PrestaShop.
5.	 In your PrestaShop control panel, click on the Preferences tab and then click on 
Themes.
6.	 Scroll to the bottom of the section and change to your new theme. Visit your shop, 
it will look no different. But now we can start to play with things.
What just happened?
We now have a canvas, so to speak, which we can start to do wonderful things with. So let’s 
do it.
Editing your CSS file
The file that we are going to play with is called global.css. It is in the CSS folder inside 
our main template folder. A good way of working with it is to open it using a program like 
Notepad++ or something similar. Notepad++ is good because it does not add any extra 
formatting to a document, which is important. You can get a free copy of Notepad++ from 
www.notepad-plus-plus.org.
We can make one change at a time, upload it to the live folder on the web server, and then 
go view the changes. Like it? Great! Don’t like it? Change it back and rethink the changes you 
would like to see.

[ 46 ]
First, I will point out a few parts of the CSS file that you can make interesting changes to, 
then I will guide you through a quick tutorial to show you how to implement the changes. I 
will discuss several potential changes all at once, but remember to do it one at a time and to 
make a backup at regular intervals. Why not open up global.css now and have a look.
If you don’t understand CSS, it will look very confusing. A complete explanation, as you might 
guess, is way beyond the scope of this book. The good news is that, generally speaking, the 
code is quite easy to interpret and it uses English words to help identify the purpose of each 
part of the code. So we can scan through it and pick out the parts we’d like to change. The 
screenshot shows a couple of examples to get you started:

Chapter 2
[ 47 ]
Background color
On line number 56 in the previous screenshot, you can change the entire background color 
in a stroke. Just change the word white to any CSS-recognized color. A few examples are 
aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, and navy. A full list can be 
found at www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp.
Font size
You can easily guess that this element determines the size of the font. Scroll through your 
global.css file. You can see dozens of references to font size; they will all change the size 
of the font at different places.
Scroll down to line number 54 (shown in the preceding screenshot) and change the value 
of 11px/14px to 14px/14px. From the context, can you guess where the font size will be 
changed? Try it out and then check the total amount for your shopping cart. Press F5 to

Themes summary
You have probably guessed that the key to making your chosen template unique and stylish 
at the same time is a combination of all the things we have discussed, along with a bit 
of extra research into the CSS elements. As usual, don’t put off further development or 
expansion of your business until you have achieved the perfect template because that day 
might never come.
As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, CSS and template design is a huge topic. If 
it is a topic that you want to find out about in detail, further reading is essential. If you just 
want a smart, unique template in a hurry, move on to the next phase of building your shop. 
Hopefully I have provided enough information here.
The other key factor in building a great template has got to be planning. I didn’t mention this 
until the end because it definitely helps to experiment a bit. Until you know what is possible, 
it is hard to imagine what you would like to achieve. When you look at a template, try and 
envision how you could change it to make it yours.
For more information about templates, visit the PrestaShop forum. There is a whole section 
devoted to the subject at www.prestashop.com/forums.

Time for action – uploading your company/store logo
So you now have your logo graphic. Here is how to add it to your shop:
1.	 Click on the Preferences tab.
2.	 Click on Themes. The next screenshot shows what you will see:
	

Chapter 2
[ 49 ]
3.	 Click on the Choose File button underneath the YourLogoHere logo and browse to 
your new logo.
4.	 While on this screen, you can also upload a new favicon. This is a tiny graphic that 
is displayed in your visitors’ web browser. Just make a 16 x 16 pixels image in GIMP 
and save it with the .ico extension.
5.	 When you’re done, save the changes by clicking on Save.
What just happened?
You now have a neat, well-optimized logo. It is starting to look like your very own PrestaShop.
Advanced parameters and administration
In this section, we can check how our server is working and set up new backups for our 
database, among others.
The Configuration Information subsection is where we get to see all the configuration 
information that our server is giving us and whether it is in accordance with our PrestaShop 
store, and also whether there are some missing files.
The Performance tab is important to set up a cache for our site. Caching is a technique to 
save documents (HTML pages, images, and so on) temporarily to reduce bandwidth and 
connections to our database, we then get a faster service.
The E-mail tab lists the e-mail to which customers send messages from the orders page.
The DB Backup tab can be used to do a backup of our database. It is very important to keep 
in mind that we need to do backups very often because if something goes wrong with our 
hosting, we could lose all our information. This in turn would mean that we would not be 
able to sell any of our products, especially in cases where we have deadlines. To avoid such a 
situation, please do a backup of your database and files at regular intervals of time.
Logs are bits of information about what’s happening in our shop. Here we can check whether 
there are any issues in our system. There are four levels to categorize this information. The 
first level, level 1, is just informative; levels 2 and 3 are warnings and errors in the system; 
if you have a level 4, then your shop is crashing and you need to fix it as soon as possible to 
keep it up and running.

Time for action – making a customer account
Now it is time to create an account for yourself in your own shop. This will be useful now, 
and later as well. It is especially useful because the My Account module is only visible to 
customers who have logged in. Follow these steps to create your own account:
1.	 Click on Your Account at the top-right corner of your store’s front end. In the 
CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT box, enter your e-mail ID and click on the Create your 
account button.
2.	 The form is self-explanatory. Fill it out and click on the green Register button at 
the bottom of the screen. You are now on the My Account page, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
[ 51 ]
What just happened?
Now you have a customer account, which as we saw is useful for testing. You have also 
checked out the My Account block, which should help you decide whether you want one in 
your PrestaShop store.
Just in case you are not sure whether you want this module, consider your customers and 
your future store. Will your store be a place that is regularly visited by repeat purchase 
customers? For example, my website Bikes4U.com sells bikes and bicycle parts. I don’t 
think the average Bikes4U customer would need a permanent link to their orders, credit 
slips, delivery addresses, and so on. The home page could be used to highlight special offers 
or new products like new arrivals or bestsellers.
However, FluffyTeddies.com also sells a huge range of build-it-yourself dolls, houses, 
and furniture. I expect enthusiasts to be constantly adding to their collections, checking on 
the progress of their orders, and buying vouchers for friends and family. They would also 
probably be interested in ordering gift items to be sent to alternate shipping addresses.  
A My Account module will definitely be useful in the teddy shop.
Permanent links block
This block can be found in roughly the same place as all the modules so far. Install it and visit 
your shop front. Notice that you now have three key links added to the top of your store. 
They are: contact, sitemap, and bookmark. Why not try them all now? See what they do.
Your sitemap page has been very cleverly created for you. As you add products and other 
pages, PrestaShop updates your site map. The contact page consists of a contact form for 
your customers or soon-to-be customers to be able to quickly and easily contact you. Notice 
the Subject Heading drop-down box? We will talk more about that later in the chapter. And 
the bookmark button enables visitors to bookmark your site just a little bit quicker than by 
clicking on the button in their web browser.
Stats
Here we can see how our customers use our website, what items are bestsellers, and the 
time and date at which you have a peak hour.
All of this information is very important and comes in handy when a particular area is not 
working fine for the customer or when you need to work on a new campaign to focus on  
an area.
Creating the “must have” pages
www.allitebooks.com

Back Office
[ 52 ]
What follows here, is a discussion of the pages you would probably expect to find on any 
e-commerce website. I will go through each in turn, discuss their purpose, and make some 
suggestions about creating your own version of the page.
Delivery
This should contain everything a customer, future or current, needs to know about the 
delivery times, return, and refund policies. Depending upon the complexity of your offering, 
this whole page might amount to a couple of paragraphs or more.
Legal notice
This page attempts to disclaim any unreasonable liabilities that you might encounter. Even if 
your content and products are not controversial, you might want to get proper legal advice 
for them.
Obviously, however, if you sell something that could leave you open to legal action, then you 
should definitely get proper legal advice and probably insurance as well.
This is one of the few areas where it might be worth getting your wallet out!
Terms and conditions
They are many rules and regulations that you might have to draft for your customers 
and visitors. Often, this can be incorporated into the legal notice. The default template 
mentioned before has sample terms and conditions for you to amend, leave, or get legal 
advice on as you see fit.
About us
This is the place to put the non-sales, non-product-specific stuff that so many new 
e-commerce sites make the mistake of putting on their home page. You can write this much 
better than I can.
What are your values? How long have you been in the business? Have you got an interesting 
startup story? How big is your business?
Your aim is to not sell anything other than YOU. Build trust and familiarity so that when your 
visitors find a product they want, they feel all warm and friendly towards you. Only then will 
they get their wallets out.
Contacting your store
What if someone needs to contact you? Perhaps they need to ask a question, complain, or 

Chapter 2
[ 53 ]
just say hello.
Contacts
You need to have relevant contacts for the different types of messages that people could 
send. Don’t panic, you don’t need to employ staff. All you need to do is tell PrestaShop 
that certain types of message go to different e-mail addresses. This makes you look more 
professional and ensures that your customers don’t feel like their message is not going into 
an empty black hole to be ignored.
Time for action – creating departments to contact
We are going to divide your shop into departments to give it a more professional feel and to 
create confidence in the customers that send you messages. Remember that when we create 
these contacts and assign e-mail addresses, you will need to have previously created them 
through your hosting account.
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab and then click on Store Contacts.
2.	 Click on Add new and enter the details of the new department/contact. Make sure 
you enter something informative in the Note box, because this is displayed to the 
customer. Then save the information.
3.	 Repeat the preceding steps for each department/e-mail address combination you 
require.
4.	 Visit your contact page and send test messages to each department to make sure 
everything is working as expected.
What just happened?
You just made your shop seem much more professional.
Multistore feature
The multistore feature is a new functionality in PrestaShop 1.5. With this functionality, you 
can easily manage several stores at once with only one back office, which means that it will 
make your life easier.
Every store is independent, but you could share categories, products pages, and so on. This 
functionality is very useful if you’re working with different markets.

Downloadable products
A downloadable product is an item that we do not need to ship. These kinds of items are 
usually songs in the .mp3 format, books in the .pdf format, or software.
When we are selling an item like this, and we choose to add a new product, we have to 
choose the type of item on the main page; in this case, it will be Virtual Product. After this 
is done, PrestaShop will ask whether this product has an associated file; we need to click on 
Yes and we can then upload the file to sell.
Are you an existing user of osCommerce?  
Let’s import it to PrestaShop
If you have been working with osCommerce, welcome to PrestaShop. Importing all your 
information is very easy. The first thing that you have to do it is to go to Modules, then scroll 
down to Importer osCommerce on the modules list and click on the Install button. Once 
you have this module installed, you will need to follow the same process as the one detailed 
before, but with the module Shop Importer.
When you have both modules installed and active, click on Configure link under Shop 
Importer. You will then see a drop-down menu. Select Importer osCommerce and click on 
Choose. Fill in all the fields and click on Import to start the process.
Summary
We achieved quite a lot in this chapter. Specifically, we covered:


Setting up the key PrestaShop modules: With a few clicks, we can add or remove 
some very significant features to or from our store.


Creating content for our home page: The home page is vital and should be updated 
frequently. It is controlled by a module.


Creating our “must have” pages: PrestaShop has an easy-to-use Content 
Management System (CMS). This makes the creation and management of unique 
pages really fast and easy. There’s more on the CMS in Chapter 4, Getting More 
Customers.


Switching themes: It is not difficult to use a ready-made theme to customize our 
PrestaShop store.


Learning how to make basic but significant customizations to our chosen theme.
Now that you have got a shop with essential pages, features, and content, it is time to give 
our customers some products to buy. That is the subject of the next chapter.

Merchandising for Success
Every successful e-commerce business needs to be customer-centric because 
without customers, our business would fail miserably. So always try to make 
your store easy, enjoyable and as fun as possible.
In this chapter, we shall cover everything to display our products, and we will:


Discuss and implement an efficient UX


Discuss and implement an efficient category structure


Add high quality product descriptions that sell


Take a look at all the different ways you can use PrestaShop to highlight products


Look at product features, attributes, accessories, and customization
So let's get on with it…
Shop categories
Creating product categories, like most things in PrestaShop, is easy and we will cover that 
soon. First we need to plan the ideal category structure, and this demands a little thought.

Merchandising for Success
[ 56 ]
Planning your category structure
You should think really hard about the following questions: What is your business key – general 
scope or specific? Remember, if the usability is complex for you, it will be difficult to get future 
customers. So what will make the navigation simple and intuitive for your customers? What 
structure will support any plan you might have for expanding the range in the future? What do 
your competitors use? What could you do to make your structure better for your customers 
than anybody else's? When you have worked it out, we will create the category structure and 
then we will create the content (images and descriptions) for your category pages.
First you need to consider what categories you want for your product range. Here are  
some examples:
If your business is geared to the general scope, then it could be something like:


Books


Electronics


Home and garden


Fashion, jewelry, and beauty
However, if your business is a closed market, for example electronics, then it could be 
something like:


Cameras and photography


Mobile and home phones


Sound and vision


Video games and consoles
You get the idea.
My examples don't have categories, subcategories, or anything deeper just for the sake of 
it. There are no prizes for compartmentalizing. If you think a fairly flat structure is what your 
customer wants, then that is what you should do.

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
If you are thinking, "Hang on, I don't have any categories let alone any subcategories," 
don't panic. If your research and common sense says you should only have a few categories 
without any subcategories, then stick to it. Simplicity is the most important thing. Pleasing 
your customer and making your shop intuitive for your customer will make you more money 
than obscure compartmentalizing of your products.
Creating your categories
Have your plan close at hand. Ideally, have it written down or, if it is very simple, have it 
clearly in your head. Enough of the theory, it is now time for action.
Time for action – how to create product categories
Make sure that you are logged into your PrestaShop back office. We will do this in two steps. 
First we will create your structure as per your plan, then in the next Time for action section, we 
will implement the category descriptions. Let's get on with the structure of your categories:
1.	 Click on Catalog and you will see the categories. Click on one.
2.	 Now click on the green + symbol to add a new subcategory. PrestaShop defines even 
your top-level categories as subcategories because the home category is considered 
to be the the top-level category.

Merchandising for Success
[ 58 ]
3.	 Just type in the title of your first main category. Don't worry about the other 
options. The descriptions are covered in a minute and the rest is to do with the 
search engines, which is covered in Chapter 4, Getting More Customers. Click on 
Save when you're done.

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
4.	 You have created your first category.
5.	 Now that you are back to the home category, you can click on the green button again 
to create your next main category. To do so, save as before and remember to check 
the Home radio button, when you are ready, to create your next main category.
6.	 Repeat until all top-level categories are created. Have a quick look at your shop  
front to make sure you like what you see. Here is a screenshot from the PrestaShop 
demo store:
7.	 Now for the subcategories. We will create one level at a time as earlier. So we will 
create all the subcategories before creating any categories within subcategories. In 
your home category, you will have a list of your main categories. Click on the first 
one in the list that requires a subcategory.
8.	 Now click on the create subcategory + icon. Type the name of your subcategory, 
leaving the other options, and click on Save.
9.	 Go back to the main category if you want to create another subcategory.
10.	Play around with clicking in and out of categories and subcategories until you get 
used to how PrestaShop works. It isn't complicated, but it is easy to get lost and start 
creating stuff in the wrong place. If this happened to you, just click on the bin icon 
to delete your mistake. Then pay close attention to the category or subcategory you 
are in and carry on. You can edit the category order from the main catalog page by 
selecting the box of the category you want to move and then clicking an up or down 
arrow.
11.	Finish creating your full category structure. Play with the category and subcategory 
links on your shop front to see how they work and then move on.

What just happened?
Superb! Your category structure is done and you should be fairly familiar with navigating 
around your categories in your control panel.
Now we can add the category and subcategory descriptions. I left it empty until now because 
as you might have noticed, the category creation palaver can be a bit fiddly and it makes 
sense to keep it as straightforward as possible. Here are some tips for writing good category 
descriptions followed by a quick Time for action section for entering descriptions into the 
category itself.
Creating content for your categories and subcategories
I see so many shops online with really dull category descriptions. Category descriptions 
should obviously describe but they should also sell! Here are a few tips for writing some 
enticing descriptions:


Keep them short—two paragraphs at the most. People do not visit your website  
to read.


The detail should be in the products themselves. Similar to a USP, category 
descriptions should be a combination of fact and emotive description that focuses 
on the benefit to the customer.


Try and be as specific as you can about each category and subcategory so that each 
description is accurate and relevant in its own right. For example, don't let the 
category steal all the glory from a subcategory.


It is very important for SEO.
Time for action – adding category descriptions
Be ready with the text for all your categories or you can, of course, type them as you go:
1.	 Go to Catalog and then on the first categories' Edit button.
2.	 Enter your category description and click on Save.
3.	 Click on the subcategories of your first category. Then enter and save a description 
for each (if any).
4.	 Navigate to the second main category and enter a description. Repeat the same for 
each of the subcategories in turn.
5.	 Reiterate the preceding steps for each category.

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
What just happened?
You now have a fully functioning category structure.
Now we can go on to look at adding some of your products.
Adding products
Click on the Catalog tab and then click on product. It is pretty similar to category.
In the Time for action section, I will cover what to enter in each box as a separate item. 
However, I will skip over a few items like meta tags because they are best dealt with on a 
site-wide basis separately.
The other important option is the product description. This deserves special treatment 
because it needs to be effective at selling your product.
With the categories, I specifically showed you how to create the structure before filling in  
the descriptions because I know others who have got into a muddle in the past. It is less 
likely, but still possible, to get into a bit of a muddle with the products as well. This is 
especially true if you have lots of them.
Perhaps you should be the judge of whether to fill in your catalog before adding descriptions 
or add descriptions as you go. So here is a handy guide to create great product descriptions. 
It will help you to decide whether you should fill product descriptions at the same time as 
the rest of the details, or whether you should just enter the product title and revisit them 
later to fill in the rest of the details.
Product descriptions that sell
Don't fall into the trap of simply describing your products. It might be true that a potential 
customer does need to know the dry facts like sizes and other uninspiring information, but 
don't put this information in the brief description or description boxes. PrestaShop provides 
a place for bare facts—the Features tab (there will be more on this soon).
The brief description and description boxes that will be described in more detail soon are 
there to sell to your customers—to increase their interest to a level that makes them "want" 
the product. It actually suggests they pop it in their cart and buy it.
The way you do this is with a very simple and age-old formula that actually works. And,  
of course, having whetted your appetite, it would be rude not to tell you about it. So here  
it goes.

Merchandising for Success
[ 62 ]
Actually selling the product
Don't just tell your customers about your product, sell them the product. Explain to them 
why they should buy it! Use the FAB technique—feature, advantage, benefit:


Tell the customer about a feature:


This teddy bear is made from a new fiber and wool mix


This laptop has the brand new i7 processor made by Intel


This guide was written by somebody who has survived cancer


And the advantage that feature gives them:


So it is really, really soft and fluffy!


i7 is the very first processor series with a DDR3 integrated memory 
controller!


So all the information and advice is real and practical


Then emphasize the real emotive benefit this gives them:


Which means your little boy or girl is going to feel safe, loved, and secure 
with this wonderful bear


Meaning that this laptop gives your applications, up to a 30 percent 
performance boost over every other processor series ever made


Giving you or your loved one the very best chance of beating with cancer 
and having more precious time they have with the people they love
Don't just stop at one feature. Highlight the most important features. By most important 
features, of course I mean the features that lead to the best most emotive and personal 
benefits. Not too many though. If your product has loads of benefits, then try and pick just 
the best ones.

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
Three is perfect. Three really is a magic number. All the best things come in threes and 
scientific research actually proves that thoughts or ideas presented in threes influence 
human emotion the most. If you must have more than three features, summarize them in  
a quick bulleted list. Three is good:


Soft, strong, and very long


Peace, love, and understanding


Relieves pain, and clears your nose without drowsiness
Ask for the sale 
When you have used the FAB technique, ask the customer to part with their money! 
Say something like, "Select the most suitable option for you and click on Add to cart" or 
"Remember that abc is the only xyz with benefit 1, benefit 2, and benefit 3. Order yours now!"
Create some images with GIMP
If you have a favorite photo editor then great. If you haven't, then I suggest you use GIMP. 
It's cool, easy, and free: www.gimp.org.
Time for action – how to add a product to PrestaShop
Let's add some products:
1.	 Click on catalog and then click on product.

Merchandising for Success
[ 64 ]
2.	 Click on the Add a new product link. You will see the following screenshots. Okay, I 
admit it. It does look a little bit daunting. But actually it is not that difficult. Much of 
it is optional, and even more we will revisit after further discussion. So don't despair. 
There is a table of explanations for you after the screenshots.

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
Field
Explanation
Name
The short name/description of your product. There is 
a brief description and a full description box later, but 
perhaps a bit more than a short name should go here.
For example, 50 cm golden teddy bear—extra fluffy 
version.
Status
Choose Enabled or Disabled. If your product is for sale 
as soon as you're open, click Enabled. If your product is 
discontinued or needs to be removed from sale for any 
reason, click Disabled.
Reference
An optional unique reference for your product.
For example, 50cmFT – xfluff.
EAN13
The European Article Number or barcode. If your product 
has one (and almost everything does), use it because 
some people use this for searching or identifying a 
product.
Jan
The Japanese Article Number or barcode. If your product 
has one (and almost everything does), use it because 
some people use this for searching or identifying a 
product.
UPC
The USA and Canadian Article Number or barcode. If your 
product has one (and almost everything does), use it 
because some people use this for searching or identifying 
a product.
Visibility
If you want to show the item on the catalog, only on the 
search or everywhere.
Type
You can chose if there is a physical product, pack, or a 
downloadable product.
Options
To make the product available/unavailable to order. To 
show or hide the price. To enable/disable the online 
message. 
Condition
If the item is brand new, second hand, or refurbished.
Short description
Here you need to add a brief description about the item. 
This text will be shown on the catalog.
Description
When a customer clicks on the item, he will read this text.
Tags
More on this in Chapter 4, Getting More Customers. 
Leave blank for now.
3.	 Fill in your product page as described previously.

Merchandising for Success
[ 66 ]
4.	 Click on the Images tab at the top of the product page.
5.	 Browse to the image you created earlier and upload it. Note that PrestaShop will 
compress the image for you. It is worth having a look at the final image and maybe 
varying the amount (if any) that you apply when creating your product images.
6.	 Click on Save and then go and admire your product in your store front.
7.	  Repeat until all your products are done, but don't forget to check how things look 
from the customer's point of view. Visit the category and product pages to check 
whether things are like the way you had expected them to be. If you have a huge 
range that is going to take you a long time, then consider just entering your key 
products. Proceed with this book to get the money coming in and add the rest of 
your range in a bit over the course of time.
What just happened?
Now you have something to actually sell, let's go and showcase some of your products. Here 
is how to make some of your products stand out from the crowd.
Highlighting products
Next is a list of the different ways to promote elements of your range. There is also an 
explanation of each option and how to do it, as well.

New products
So you have just found some great new products. How do you let your visitors know about 
it? You could put an announcement on your front page. But what if a potential customer 
doesn't visit your front page or perhaps misses the announcement?
Welcome to the new products module.
Time for action – how to highlight your newest products
The following are the quick steps to enable and configure the highlighting of any new 
products you add. Once this is set up, it will happen automatically, now and in the future.
1.	 Click on the Modules tab and scroll down to the New products block module.
2.	 Click on Install.
3.	 Scroll back down to the module you just installed and click on Configure.
4.	 Choose a number of products to be showcased and click on Save.
5.	 Don't forget to have a look at your shop front to see how it works. Click around a 
few different pages and see how the highlighted product alternates.
What just happened?
Now you are done with new products and they will never go unnoticed.
Specials
Special refers to the price. This is the traditional special offer that customers know and love.
Time for action – creating a special offer
The following steps help us create special offers and make sure they will never go unnoticed:
1.	 Click on the Catalog tab and navigate to the category or subcategory that contains 
the product you want to make available as a special offer.
2.	 Click on the Products to go to its details page.

Merchandising for Success
[ 68 ]
3.	 Click on Prices and go to the Specific prices section.
4.	 Click on Add a new specific price.
5.	 You can enter an actual monetary amount in the first box or a percentage in the 
second box. Monetary amounts work well for individual discounts and percentages 
work well as part of a wider sale. But this is not a hard-and-fast rule. So choose what 
you think your customers might prefer. Click on Save.
6.	 Now go and have a look at the category that the product is in and click on the 
product as well. You'll notice the smart enticing manner that PrestaShop uses to 
highlight the offer. You can have as many or as few special offers as you like.
7.	 But what if you wanted to really push a product offer or a wider sale? Yes, you 
guessed it, there's a module.
8.	 Click on the Modules tab and scroll down to Specials block and click on Install. 
Getting the hang of this? Thought so.
9.	 Go and have a look at the effect on your store.

What just happened?
Your first sale is underway.

What's this then? When customers browse products, they forget what they have seen or 
how to find it again. By prominently displaying a module with their most recent viewings, 
they can comfortably click back and forth comparing until they have made a buying decision. 
Now you don't need me to tell you how to set this up. Go to the module, switch it on, and 
you're done.
Best sellers
This is just what it says. Not necessarily an offer or anything else is special about it. But if it 
sells, well there must be something worth talking about it. Install the best sellers module in 
the usual place to highlight these items.
Accessories
I love accessories. It's all about add-on sales. Ever been to a shop to buy a single item and 
come out with several? Electrical retailers are brilliant at this. Go in for a PC and come out with 
a printer, scanner, camera, ink, paper, and the list goes on. Is it because their customers are 
stupid? Of course they are not! It is because they offer compelling or essential accessories that 
are relevant to the sale. By creating accessories, you will get a new tab at the bottom of each 
relevant product page along with PrestaShop making suggestions at key points of the sale.
All we have to do is tell PrestaShop what is an accessory to our various products and 
PrestaShop will do the rest.

Time for action – creating an accessory
Accessories are products. So any product can be an accessory of any other product. All you 
have to do is decide what is relevant to what. Just think about appropriate accessories for 
your products and read on. The quick guide for creating accessories are as follows:
1.	 Click on the Catalog tab, then click on product. Find the product you think should 
have some accessories.
2.	 Click on it to edit it by navigating to Associations on the page and find the 
Accessories section, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Find the product that you wish to be an accessory by typing the first letters of the 
product name and selecting it.
4.	 Save your amended product. You can add as many accessories to each product as 
you like.
5.	 Go and have a look at your product on your shop front and notice the  
Accessories tab.

Chapter 3
[ 71 ]
What just happened?
You just learned how to accessorize. It's silly not to accessorize, not because it costs you 
nothing, but because a few clicks could significantly increase your turnover.
Now we can go on to explore more product ideas.
Features
This is very useful. Suppose you have a range of products and they all have features in 
common. Take, for instance, teddy bears. They are all made of something. But what if you 
want to have different groups for material or for size, and you need a simple solution for 
making that information available without polluting the product description? An example 
would be useful.
I have a range of teddy bears and they are made from super-soft cotton, micro-fiber, or wool 
knit. So I create a feature and call it ''Material''. I can then create a range of ''Values'' for 
''Material'' such as super-soft cotton, micro-fiber, and wool knit. And I can assign values to 
any products that I choose.
You can create as many features and associated values as you need. You might want a 
country of origin feature, with assigned values of ''Europe'', ''China'', and ''India''. You might 
also have products with a manufacturer's rating. For example, Intel processors. They all have 
a star rating from one to five. You could create a feature of colors. The important point here 
is that features are usually used when it is not a fundamental part of the buying decision.
When you create features and values, you assign them to appropriate products. PrestaShop 
very kindly creates an extra tab on the appropriate page with all the appropriate features 
and values. The customer might not bother checking these values so clearly; PrestaShop's 
Features is for additional information that the customer might want to read.
You probably wouldn't create a color feature for a T-shirt. That would be a critical or 
fundamental part of the buying decision and would almost certainly be in the product 
description, title, image, or attribute (more in a bit). However, the color of a computer cable 
would be a secondary or optional requirement and might make a good candidate for a 
feature.
One thing features are definitely not used for is when that feature makes a difference to the 
price. Variations like this would be handled by another aspect of PrestaShop that we will 
cover very soon. Also, features will not show as part of the description when added to the 
customer's cart. If this is important to you, then Features is not for you.
Think carefully about how PrestaShop's Features can be used for your product range and 
have a look at the quick manner in which you can implement them.

Merchandising for Success
[ 72 ]
Time for action – using PrestaShop's features
Here we will implement a range of features and values. I am using the country of origin 
example; you can choose what is appropriate to your product range.
1.	 Click on Catalog | Features.
2.	 Now click on Add new feature and type the name of your first feature and then click 
on Save.
3.	 Next click on the Add new feature value button and type the name of the first value 
of this feature. Select from the drop-down list the new feature, and then click on 
Save.
4.	 Repeat step 3 for all values of that feature.
5.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all of the features you want to create.
6.	 Now click on the Catalog tab again and browse to the category of the first product 
you want to add a feature to. Click on the product to edit it.
7.	 Now click on Features.

Chapter 3
[ 73 ]
8.	 Select the feature and then the value from the drop-down list and click on Save.
9.	 Go and look at the cool Data sheet tab that has appeared with that product on the 
shop front.
10.	Assign as many products and values as you need.
What just happened?
You have now implemented the features option on your product range and have learned that 
features are for optional or additional product information that does not affect the price.
Now we can go on to explore and discuss product attributes. Attributes sounds fairly dull 
but in fact is a very powerful feature and in my opinion is probably better implemented in 
PrestaShop than in any other shopping cart software. This is because PrestaShop makes a 
potentially complicated process nice and simple.
Attributes
These are a lot more interesting than the name suggests. PrestaShop allows you to  
create attribute groups and then actual attributes within those groups, and then assigns 
them to products. A very quick and simplistic way of describing an attribute would be as  
a product variation.
For example, attributes are a perfect way to have a single product: teddy T-shirt. Then create a 
Color attribute group and lots of actual attributes—Red, Blue, Pink, and so on. The customer 
could then, from one single product page, select any of the available colors for that teddy 
T-shirt. Have a look at attributes in action:
As you can see, the customer is able to click on a drop-down box and choose from the 
different attributes (product variations). The first thing to note here is that this is a simplistic 
example and we will get a bit deeper into this before we try attributes out. The other thing 
to point out is that just because you might sell a product with multiple variations does not 
mean you must have attributes.

Merchandising for Success
[ 74 ]
As an example, I might introduce a range of teddy T-shirts with karate, heart, or skateboarder 
pictures. I certainly could create an attribute group called style and attribute values of karate, 
heart, and skateboarder. However, I might decide that displaying all of the styles and their 
pictures in a list in the teddy T-shirts' category was very important, perhaps to make sure that 
all the options were clearly visible. In this instance, using attributes wouldn't be a good idea.
So as with other product options in PrestaShop, attributes and their usage need to be 
considered and planned carefully. Always keep in mind what is best for helping the customer 
make a purchase!
I said that my example was simplistic. You can actually do so much with attributes that it 
is really not possible to cover it all in this book. Here are some of the most likely scenarios 
where attributes are indispensable.
What if my teddy T-shirts came in white, green, blue, and pink? Consider if the white version 
was £5 and all the colored versions were £7. This is no problem at all. I can create attributes 
and groups and specify the different increases in price that the different attributes should 
have. Then when the customer uses the drop-down menu to browse the different options, 
they would be presented with the correct price. Not only this but the product image can also 
be varied to show the different options as and when they are selected.
PrestaShop even allows you to specify a new weight for each combination (for shipping 
purposes), an eco-tax, and different references/barcodes for each variation. PrestaShop even 
has a ''product combinations generator'' to enable automatic assigning of specified attributes 
to any given product.
Time for action – an attributes example
Here we will see how to create several versions of a product. The customer can then select 
the one they want from a drop-down list. The product price and images will also be updated:
1.	 Click on Catalog and then on Attributes and Values.
2.	 Let's start by adding an attribute. Click on Add new Attributes and type in the name 
of your attributes group. In my case, T-shirt styles.
3.	 Notice you have the option to enter a different public name. So you could call 
your attribute group something different in the admin and shop fronts. If this is 
important, perhaps to avoid using overly technical terms, then do so. If possible, I 
would keep them the same to avoid confusion.
4.	 Click on Save when you're ready.
5.	 Next click on Add new value. I will be adding my first T-shirt style—Karate. Then 
Save it. Keep adding attribute values from different groups until you have added all 
that you need.

Chapter 3
[ 75 ]
6.	 The color checkbox gives you the facility to provide actual colors, not just 
descriptions. If you choose these, you will simply enter a color code as well as an 
attribute value for each option. If you are providing an image for each attribute 
option, this feature is unnecessary. I suggest leaving it unchecked unless your 
situation specifically requires it.
7.	 Now we will go to the first product that we need to add these newly created attributes 
to. So click on Catalog, find the appropriate product, and click on it to edit it.
8.	 Notice the Combinations tab among the other product tabs. Click on it and we will 
create our product combinations from our attributes.
9.	 At the top, click on new combination.
10.	 Below this click on Add and it will be added to the box. You can add multiple attributes 
to this product this way, but keep it simple for now and leave it at just one.
11.	You can now optionally add references, locations, and EAN codes.
12.	Here is the really good bit. Suppose one option is a bit more expensive, a bit heavier, 
or has a different eco-tax to the original product to be applied, simply enter that 
next in the area indicated below:
13.	Enter an Quantity, or Wholesale price if it is different from the original product. 
When it comes to Impact on price, select None, Increase or Decrease, then in the 
quantity box put the amount of the increase or decrease. You can do the same with 
weight, but as explained when creating products, this is only necessary if you intend 
to calculate postage using weight.
14.	If you want to create a different image for this combination, it needs to be 
previously uploaded on the image tab. You can then simply check the box next to 
the appropriate image.
15.	When you're done, click on Save.
16.	You can now click on the product again, select Combinations again, and add another 
combination based on different attributes.
17.	Go and have a look at your product in the shop front to see it in action.

Merchandising for Success
[ 76 ]
What just happened?
You now know how to create product combinations using attributes.
The last possibility I would like you to just consider is this. Remember accessories? Your 
customers are shown a range of pre-selected add-on sales to choose from. What about 
creating attribute groups to match product categories and values to match actual products? 
Your customers could click on a drop-down menu and instantly add the T-shirt of their choice 
to their teddy. Nice!
Have a go hero – the combinations generator
If like my teddy T-shirt example you only have a few combinations, that is not a problem. But 
what about if we had multiple combinations from multiple attribute groups each containing 
multiple values? The above process could be rather long and frustrating! Fortunately, there is 
a solution. The clue is in the Have a go hero title.
Here's the answer:
Simply click on the combinations generator at the top of the Combinations tab. Select all 
the attributes from the right-hand box that you want to use with this product. Click on Add 
| Generate, and a table of all the possible combinations are generated. You can delete with 
a single click those that are unnecessary and fill in the weights and prices of those you want 
to keep. Then click on Generate and its done. There is an imperfection with generating 
attributes when you have lots of them. If you generate more than 10,000, you might run into 
problems but I am reliably informed that a fix/new module is in progress.
Customizing
This is a bit more niche than the other product features we have seen and there is a good 
chance you might not need this. But just knowing that you have the customizing option 
might open your mind to new ideas. And if you do need to offer your customer's custom 
options then this quick explanation and guide will be invaluable.
So what is customizing in a PrestaShop context? Click on the Customization tab of one of 
your products.
Notice you have the option to specify the number of File fields and/or Text fields. If you do, 
then these would appear on the product page. Try it if you're curious. So let's say I am selling 
a teddy bear T-shirt, and I would like the customer to specify a name to put on the T-shirt. 
All I need to do is to add a positive number in the appropriate box. PrestaShop would then 
pass on the details of the customization when the customer places the order. Of course, I 
could specify multiple text fields for a message. I could also specify a file field enabling the 
customer to upload a file to me. This could be a photograph for the teddy T-shirt or perhaps 
a picture to go on a custom gift tag.

Chapter 3
[ 77 ]
All this assumes of course that I can produce the teddy T-shirts. PrestaShop obviously 
cannot do that for me. But the scope of the customization feature is only limited by your 
imagination. Here is a quick guide to add a customization to your product.
Time for action – allowing your customers to customize
Follow this simple guide to add customizations to your products:
1.	 Find and click on the product you want to add a customization option to.
2.	 Click on the Customization tab and enter the number of file and text fields you 
require to enable your customers to configure their customization.
3.	 Save the product.
4.	 Go and visit the product page to see the effect. How simple was that?
What just happened?
Although not needed by every store owner, this is a powerful product feature that is well 
worth being aware of.
Product mania!
Everything we have looked at in this chapter is fairly non-technical. But the huge range of 
options and features you have at your disposal can sometimes cause apparent complexity. 
It is well worth playing with the PrestaShop catalog options, and perhaps, re-reading this 
chapter so that you can fully grasp how PrestaShop manages your catalog and how incredibly 
flexible and diverse it is.
Having said that, don't hold back on further development until everything is perfect. Any 
e-commerce store should be an ongoing cyclical thing that you constantly add to, improve, 
and refine. Also, don't forget my suggestion about opening your shop with just a core range 
of products and then adding more on an ongoing basis. If you can be making money while 
working on your catalog, then I think it makes sense.

Getting More Customers
In this chapter, we will be looking at a number of topics related to getting more 
visitors to your website. There are two main ways in which we can achieve 
this. The first is by giving in to the whims of the search engines. We will look at 
keywords; everything from choosing them to using them, and taking advantage 
of a whole range of PrestaShop SEO (Search Engine Optimization) utilities.
We will also look at giving your customers a bit more. Your potential customers' 
visit to your site needs to be worthwhile and useful for them. We will achieve 
this by talking about writing articles related to your business and then we will 
use the PrestaShop content management features to highlight them.
We will look at a few really quick and simple methods to attract customers who speak a 
language that is different ours. We will look at the following features:

Using PrestaShop language features
So let's get on with it.

SEO: Search Engine Optimization
It is my opinion that people are more important than search engines when marketing your 
content. It's true, though, that there are lots of things you can and cannot do to try and 
improve your success with search engines regarding the number of visitors that they send you.
You can read enormous technical books written by greatly esteemed gurus on the subject, 
but consider this: search engine companies invest vast fortunes in their systems; they do 
this so that they can present to their users interesting, useful, and (here's the big one) 
appropriate content based on the search their user performs.
Therefore, by understanding your customer, your business, and your product niche, you 
will achieve far more than by using any trick or secret that can be shared in a book. The 
important questions for us now are, how well do we understand our customers and which 
keywords and search terms will our customers use?
Which keywords should we use?
Are you using the same keywords and phrases your customers will be using? Let us assume 
that you are selling big television sets, and throughout your website you refer to them as 
"flat panel TVs". Is that the most popular phrase the type of person you are trying to attract 
will use to search for your product?
If people don't search for "flat panel TVs", and instead use the terms "plasma screen", 
"LCD TV", "OLED television", or one of dozens of other phrases with a similar meaning, you 
will miss out on loads of free visitors. What about this conundrum—laptop, notebook, or 
portable PC? That is the question; how would you decide?
There are a number of premium software programs and web services you can buy, but I 
am guessing you didn't buy this book just to be referred to someone else for an additional 
expense. There are various sites where you can get a limited time trial of products that will 
help you find the popular keywords for your industry. Later, in Chapter 9, Go...to the Future 
we will look at Google Analytics, which has precise tools for choosing keywords.
But as optimization is an ongoing process, I don't recommend even the free ones, as you will 
have to pay eventually. And Google Analytics, although free, does not give you the hands-on 
experience and feedback that you will get by following this guide. Now if you are building a 
PrestaShop megastore with thousands of products, then fine, get your wallet out. Otherwise 
try this.

Chapter 4
[ 81 ]
Discovering the value of keywords
Visit Google, Bing, and the other search engines, and search for different terms. Keep  
it simple. Perhaps just two or three word phrases to start with. If there are a couple of  
paid-for adverts down the right-hand side or at the top, then you have probably chosen a 
phrase that is worth considering. I say this because the fact that there is an advert means 
that somebody else believes it is worth paying for. It is not necessary to have the best 
phrase; innovate, create, and you might discover a phrase that a lot of people in your 
industry would be prepared to pay for.
Different niches will have different volumes of competition, so you have to compare the 
phrases for your niche to others. Next, search for the same terms again and take a look at 
the number of results returned for that search. Be sure to have a pen and paper handy to 
make notes on your findings.
Meta tags
Meta tags are words and descriptions about the information on your PrestaShop shop  
that are not seen by your customer. They reside in the code of your page, which some  
search engines read to help determine the words that they will use to index your site. 
Implementing meta tags well could help the search engines accurately determine your  
site's content. Meta tags are not as important as they used to be—some search engines  
do not use them at all—but they are so simple to implement in PrestaShop that they are  
well worth using.
They should be a part of your overall keyword strategy; we've already taken a look at them.
Meta tags can be defined for PrestaShop category, product, and article pages. Here I will 
show you how to easily add them to your category and product pages, and you will see  
how to add them to your articles later in the chapter.
Types of meta tags
There are meta titles, meta descriptions, and meta keywords. We will start with a brief 
explanation of each type of meta tag, then a Time for action section where you can begin to 
implement them.


Meta titles are short titles relevant to the specific page concerned. If this is an 
article, then the meta title can be the same as the title. If the page is a category or 
product, then a bit more imagination could be worthwhile. Perhaps a 50 cm tall 
fluffy teddy with extra fluff could become "Buy this 50 cm fluffy teddy with extra 
fluff finish".

Getting More Customers
[ 82 ]


Meta descriptions are easy to define for products and categories. Often the brief 
descriptions from the product pages are suitable here. For articles, a brief summary 
of the title and key points would be good.


Meta keywords are lists of keywords you deem the most appropriate for use on any 
given page—just one, two, or three word phrases separated by a comma in a list. For 
example, fluffy teddy, teddies, extra fluff, 50 cm teddy bear, and so on.
Time for action – PrestaShop meta tags
This section shows you where and how to enter your meta information for products and 
categories. Articles are covered later in the chapter.
1.	 Hover on the Catalog tab and click on Categories, and then click on the Edit icon of 
the first category to add meta tags. Scroll down to the meta information text boxes 
and enter your meta tags. Save the category.
2.	 Repeat the first step until all your categories have meta tags.
3.	 Hover on the Catalog tab and then click on Products then click on the first product 
that you want to add meta tags to. Click on the SEO tab on the left-hand side panel 
and enter your meta tags. Save the product.

Chapter 4
[ 83 ]
4.	 Repeat until all your products have meta tags.
What just happened?
Your products and categories now have meta information so that (some) search engines can 
quickly assess the likely content of your website.
Tag clouds
Tag clouds are cool. They look good, the search engines like them, and customers like them. 
But what are they? A tag cloud is a list of keywords and phrases arranged in a way so as to 
tempt visitors to click on them. But why would we do this? What is the point?
It doesn't matter how well you define your meta tags or how carefully you write your product 
descriptions and articles. Some visitors might still turn up on your website, by accident.
A tag cloud is a bit like an unordered, highly relevant index. It contains the words and phrases 
you choose. So visitors scan the words (because that is what their brains do) and if they see a 
word or phrase that means something to them, they click it. And hey presto, they are on the 
relevant product page that has all the information they need. That's the theory anyway.
Actually, a tag cloud can seriously enhance your site's usability and profitability. Here is one 
from www.amazon.com:
If you want your own tag cloud, read on.

[ 84 ]
Time for action – creating a tag cloud
Let's see how to create a tag cloud.
1.	 Click on the Modules subtab under the Modules tab and scroll down to the Tags 
block module.
2.	 Now click on Configure.
3.	 Here you can choose the number of tags you want there to be in your cloud. There 
is no best number as such, just choose what is right for your shop. For instance, for 
a small PrestaShop online store that I had made with 10 products, a cloud of 10 tags 
looked good and some really relevant tags were displayed.
4.	 Play with the number of tags and see what is displayed and what your tag cloud 
looks like on your shop front. Click on Save each time you try a different number.
What just happened?
You just made your shop front a lot more friendly. A tag cloud is great for those of your 
visitors who do a one-click search. And lots of visitors who won't use a search box will use a 
tag cloud.
Friendly URLs
A friendly URL is the best way to remember a web address; the customer can easily revisit a 
website by typing this in the address bar. In PrestaShop, a friendly URL will be in the format 
domain/category/product.
Time for action – how to get search-friendly URLs
So there are big benefits for completing this Time for action. We need to make a minor 
modification to the files on our website and then tell PrestaShop to enable friendly URLs. 
Here goes:
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab then click on SEO & URLs.
2.	 Scroll down, select Yes on Friendly URL, and click on Save.

Chapter 4
[ 85 ]
3.	 On the dashboard, you can check whether everything went smoothly.
4.	 Now, it is possible that this didn't work! It is even possible that you get an error 
whenever you try to view your store. Don't panic. This means that your web host 
does not support URL rewriting. Simply go back to Step 2 and disable friendly URLs, 
and all will be well. A web host not supporting URL rewriting seems to be a fairly 
rare event these days, so it is very unlikely that this will be a problem.
What just happened?
First of all, when you click on the Save button, PrestaShop creates a file on your website  
that gives instructions to the Apache web server to dig deeper; this file is called .htaccess. 
This then enables PrestaShop to make use of a web server feature called URL rewriting. 
PrestaShop uses this to make up friendly URLs. We also mentioned that if your web host 
does not allow its server to do this, then you will need to disable the friendly URL feature.
Canonical URLs
Canonical URLs refer to when similar or duplicate content appears on your website, but  
on different URLS. The simplest explanation is www.yoursite.com and yoursite.com.  
Type either of these into a web browser and you will probably end up on your home page. 
This apparently harmless situation can cause problems with how highly search engines rate 
your page.

Getting More Customers
[ 86 ]
When you specify your preferred canonical URL as either www.yoursite.com or 
yoursite.com, PrestaShop makes minor but important modifications to the code in your 
web pages that tells search engines what the situation on your website is. This helps avoid 
any of the pitfalls mentioned earlier.
Time for action – choosing your canonical URL
Here's how to specify your canonical URL and tell PrestaShop to use it:
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab and then click on SEO & URLs.
2.	 Now scroll down to the Set up URLs section.
3.	 Click on Yes for Automatically redirect to Canonical URL.
4.	 Click on Save, and you're done.
What just happened?
PrestaShop will now make sure that your chosen canonical URL is used exclusively. This, as 
we discussed, has great potential benefits for the search engine ranking of your site. Now 
let's take a look at adding some great articles to your PrestaShop store.
Writing and displaying articles
Articles are what you give to people as an incentive to visit your website, especially when 
they are not considering a purchase. By creating high quality, useful articles, you can attract 
visitors through search engines, create loyalty, and subtly promote products.
Good ideas when writing articles
Most of your visitors are probably not planning on reading all of your articles or even a  
single page. They are most likely looking for a fact, figure, or piece of information.
The goal is to make it very easy for them to find and even more compelling to  
continue reading.
Make your articles easy to read
Reading from a screen is more difficult than reading from a book. That is why you need to 
consider making readability as high as possible when writing your articles. If you have a 
subject people are interested in (which you will find out when they visit repeatedly) and 
you focus your efforts in making your pages easy to get information from, then people will 
like your articles. And if we work on the assumption that search engines know what people 
want, they will also rank you higher and more sites will want to link to you. The result is 
more visitors. So by focusing on what your visitor wants, you will get what you want.

Chapter 4
[ 87 ]
Consider carefully who your website and the specific page you are working on are aimed 
at. Under what circumstances would somebody want to read your page? Is the page 
worded and structured in such a way as to accommodate their circumstances? Do the most 
important pieces of information jump out of the page or are they hidden away in a huge 
section in the middle?
Think about your audience
Think about the level of expertise your customers have. What language or level of industry 
jargon will they like and what will bore them? Don't use technical jargon or clever words 
unless you are certain that is what your reader likes.
Don't use long words where short ones will do. Forget about preamble! Your first heading 
and paragraph should be 100 percent specific and lay out clearly what the rest of the article 
is about. By all means use colorful and interesting language, but not at the expense of 
immediate clarity. The first heading should sum up the article; for example, you would put 
"How to write articles" first and not "Hints and tips when getting started with writing".
Sell, but sell subtly
Don't go over the top. Don't give away the product. It is perfectly acceptable to turn a word or 
phrase in your article into a link to a product, as long as it doesn't trick the reader into viewing 
the product; but don't use too many product links. Links to information the reader is looking 
for are the most important, or readers might find your web page too hard to navigate, and 
leave. Don't forget that the article is surrounded by your PrestaShop modules—new products, 
specials, and so on. They will find your products when they are ready to.
Don't promote your products unless it is appropriate. In every industry, there are 
products that are right for different people in different situations. If you are a 100 percent 
honest when you are in a situation where your product is not suitable, your reader will 
subconsciously recognize your honesty.
If you recommend a cheap, reliable laptop that is appropriate for a student, and if that 
recommendation seems fit to him/her, you might get a recommendation. Also, when you 
explain how wonderful and appropriate another product is, they are more likely to believe 
you and get their wallet out.
Page formatting and keyword density
Headers, underlines, italics, image filenames, article titles, and so on—that's what formatting 
is. It's all the different ways in which you can present information or add relevance and 
appropriateness to the article.
Use relevant keywords and phrases to name your pictures and pages. For example, use 
15cm_fluffy_teddy.jpg instead of img012.jpg.

Focus your effort on what is good for humans. Create an H2 heading containing the keywords/
phrases at the beginning of the article. Use the same keywords/phrases in the first paragraph. 
Consider making them bold or italicized. Use H3 and H4 headings generously and appropriately, 
with similar or identical keywords/phrases later in the article. Lots of well-ordered, clear, 
nested headings make your articles easily scanable and more likely to be read in full.
Use links (with keywords/phrases) to relevant parts of the same page or other pages in  
your shop. All the above techniques not only make your article easier to scan, but they  
also highlight key bits of information, making your article genuinely useful. When you  
make useful articles, visitors will like you, and people buy from people they like.
How many times should the keywords/phrases be used?
This is probably one of the most widely sought after pieces of information on SEO. What 
percentage of keyword density is perfect? That is, if your page has a hundred words, how 
many of them are the words you think people searching for you will use?
In a nutshell: sorry, I don't know. If you take Google for example, their formula for calculating 
page rank is a very closely guarded secret. If somebody tells you the percentage is "x", then 
they are lying, misinformed, or at best, making an estimate based on experience.
The truth is that there probably is no specific percentage anyway. It is, in fact, based on a 
publicly unknown and extremely complicated list of variables like the number of links to 
your site, their content, the rank of the site, the pages they appear on, the density, spacing, 
format, and their location on the page, as well as the location of the page on your site, and 
many more factors.
So how on earth do you optimize for such complexity? The most important thing you can do 
is make sure you choose the words your customers are likely to use. Use them in different 
formats and locations: headings, links, underlines, bold, and so on. Some should be near the 
end of the page, some in the links outside the main body of the page, and some in the pages 
linking to the page.
However, do not use more keywords or phrases than is natural to a human reader. If it 
sounds natural, looks natural, and uses the words and phrases your customers are using, 
that's good.

Quick tips


If you have a complicated subject where you need to go into detail, then that's not 
a problem. Try to keep the beginning of the article simple and build the complexity 
later in the article, and pay extra attention to all the rest of the tips.


Think and plan the structure of your article before you start writing. This includes 
deciding upon highly relevant, to-the-point titles and subtitles. Good and frequent 
subtitles divide your article into sections and help readers target what they want, 
and this makes the whole article easier to read.


Use shorter paragraphs and sentences. They make your article easier to read.


Use bulleted lists for key pieces of information. A bit like these.


Don't make the pages too long. Consider breaking the article into multiple articles if 
it seems heavy to read it all together.
Most readers will scan the first line of a few titles and paragraphs to discover if your article 
has what they want. Make the first sentence of each paragraph highly relevant and precise.
Writing the summary
Everything discussed in the preceding sections might seem a bit daunting, but try to write 
your articles keeping all that guidance in mind, but don't wait until it is perfect. You wouldn't 
be reading this now if I had aimed for perfection. Is it useful? Is it clear and simple to scan 
and read? Is it professional? If so, publish it. You can always revise it another time or react  
to feedback.
Using the CMS
Now that we have gone through the ins and outs of writing good articles for your website, 
it is time to actually put up those articles on your website. If you have the articles at hand, 
ready to be copied and pasted, that's great! If you like, you can write them as you go. 
Remember the tip about not waiting until it's perfect?

Time for action – creating the article
Let's use the CMS to create your first article on PrestaShop.
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab and then click on CMS.
2.	 Click on the first green button, Add new, in CMS Categories . This is how we will 
create a new CMS Category.
3.	 Fill in all the required fields.
4.	 You now know exactly what to do with the three "meta" options.
5.	 Friendly URLs are cool. I suggest you enter the title of your article in this field, with 
a dash between each word. So Why teddies are so fluffy would be entered 
as why-teddies-are-so-fluffy. Just leave out the speech marks and use lower 
case for all the characters.
6.	 Select the Parent CMS Category.
7.	 Click on Save. Now you have a new CMS category.
8.	 Now click on the Add new button next to Pages in this category.

Chapter 4
[ 91 ]
9.	 Fill all the required fields.
10.	Don't forget to select the Displayed option, otherwise your new article will not be 
readable.
11.	When the article is ready, click on Save.
12.	Repeat these steps as many times as you want to write new articles.
What just happened?
You have written an article and put it on the PrestaShop system. There is just one thing left 
to be done. How can people read your article?
robots.txt
Search engines are our guests. They should be looked after and treated respectfully, because 
when they get grumpy with you they can cause all sorts of problems. For example, they 
could stop sending you visitors. Never forget that search engines are businesses themselves. 
They are not obliged to feature you in their search results.

Creating a file and placing it conveniently on your website server will let the search engines 
know that they are welcome, but you also need to point out that there are some places that 
a guest should not go. That's fine, they won't be offended. In fact, they will be quite pleased 
that you saved them the bother of searching areas that are not needed. Want to see what 
robots.txt looks like? Have a look at the following screenshot or download your copy of 
the file from the main, top-level folder of your website:
You can see that the robots.txt file is not like brain surgery; moreover, there are many 
things you can do with one. For a full exploration of robots.txt files, have a look at  
www.robotstxt.org, or to quickly generate the recommended PrestaShop default, 
complete the following Time for action section.
Time for action – creating robots.txt
Here, we will create a robots.txt file and place it on your web server. It will keep the 
search engines from indexing unnecessary pages like account pages. This is good, as it will 
prevent search results about your site from becoming cluttered.
1.	 In your PrestaShop control panel, hover over the Preferences tab and click on  
SEO & URLs.
2.	 Scroll down to the Robots file generation section.
3.	 Click on the Generate robots.txt file button.
4.	 Now you have a robots.txt file on your server.
What just happened?
You have just (respectfully) marked a few areas of your store as off-limits to the search 
engines. However, please note this is not a security feature. It does not block access, but 
merely asks search engines (99 percent of them) to avoid certain areas. We will cover actual 
security measures in Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery.

Helping Google with sitemaps
A sitemap is just that—a map. It outlines the structure of your website and includes 
pertinent information such as the date on which it was last updated and the frequency with 
which it is updated. Suppose that you added an important product to the bottom of a big 
subcategory. In all likelihood, Google will have to crawl through your entire site to find it and 
add it to the search results.
With sitemaps, Google can be made aware of this page, any other such pages, and any 
modifications. Google can then specifically crawl the new or updated pages. This is better for 
you and easier for Google.
Time for action – Google sitemaps tutorial
So how do we get one of these sitemap.xml files? You probably guessed. PrestaShop has a 
module that makes one. And as always it's a breeze to implement.
1.	 Click on the Modules subtab under the Modules tab and scroll down to the Google 
sitemap module.
2.	 Click on Configure.
3.	 To generate the sitemaps.xml file after you have selected your options, click on 
the Update sitemap file button.
4.	 You should do this every time you add to your site, such as adding products, 
categories, or articles. Also, do this if you're making a significant change to the 
content as well.
5.	 Want to have a look what this sitemap.xml file looks like? Click on the link that the 
Google sitemap module displays. Have a look at all the information that PrestaShop 
has generated.
What just happened?
Creating and keeping this file up-to-date will help Google easily keep up with the changes to 
your website, and that is a good thing. You can also consider submitting a sitemap to Yahoo! 
and Bing.
PrestaShop search weightings
So how does the PrestaShop search system work? It works in much the same way as a real 
search engine. It analyzes the content of the shop and matches it to the words and phrases 
used by your visitors when they type in a search query. It then uses weightings, a sort of 
important criterion, to decide which results to give to the visitor.

Getting More Customers
[ 94 ]
The criteria considered include category, product, article, and even meta tags. So which 
is most important? PrestaShop does know what it is doing (trust me on that) and it has 
devised default weightings for each type of content. As you might expect with PrestaShop, 
these weightings are configurable. To get an idea of how it works, have a look at the next 
screenshot or log in to your PrestaShop control panel, hover over the Preferences tab, and 
click on Search.
Let's run through the options. At the top of the Search section, you have a Yes or No option 
for Ajax search. This refers to the cool manner in which the search results are displayed as you 
type. If you think your customers are likely to be using old web browsers or you are using one 
of the older PrestaShop templates discussed in Chapter 2, Back Office, then you can choose No. 
Otherwise, you might as well leave it on Yes for the user-friendly and rather nifty effects.
Instant search is a functionality that allows the autocomplete feature for the search field. 
This can be useful for your visitors.
Minimum word length (in characters) is just what the name says. You can define a minimum 
word length for PrestaShop to start bothering with the identification of words. Three is a 
good minimum, so words like "at", "a", "is", and "by" are ignored. This is almost always a 
good idea.
The next option, Blacklisted words, allows you to specifically name a list of words that you 
want ignored. If you sold products like c5, then you would obviously need to allow two-letter 
words in your search results. You could then specifically define the two-letter words you 
didn't want included here, such as "at", "a", "is", and "by".

Chapter 4
[ 95 ]
The next section contains a list of content areas, and boxes to type in your chosen weight 
for each content area. The higher the number, the more important that content area is 
considered. Now that you know how to change the weightings, do consider that PrestaShop 
developers know what they are doing, but they might not know what you are doing. That is 
why I have brought these search options to your attention. As usual, think and plan what is 
important on your sites, and make changes if needed.

Switching languages
This is great. PrestaShop has very helpfully created versions of its software in many 
languages. Your first option is to download and install PrestaShop in the language of your 
choice. Here I am assuming that you have already downloaded and set up PrestaShop in  
your language, but you now want to add another.
Because PrestaShop has already done the work to make it available in so many languages, 
it is quite easy to add another language. But what do I mean by adding another language? 
All the content that you create remains the same. But all the default writing can be changed 
by the customer to any language that you choose to allow them to install. What this means 
is that all your blocks, modules, buttons, checkout instructions, and more, will change 
languages at the click of a button.
In some cases, this will be enough to get a sale from somebody who speaks that other 
language, but that is not always the case. We will go a little further with the next tutorial. For 
now, here's how to allow your customers to change the default language in the shop front.
Time for action – enabling a second language
It is very simple to vary the following instructions to install whichever language you want:
1.	 Hover over the Localization tab, click on Languages, and then click on the  
Add new button.
2.	 Now fill the form. The name should be straightforward, for example, French, 
German, Swahili, or whatever.
3.	 Every country has an internationally recognized country code. To find the one for 
your second language, visit http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/. Enter 
this in the ISO code box.
4.	 Next, for the Flag field, browse to a graphic of the flag for that country. A handy 
website very helpfully makes some available here: http://www.famfamfam.com/
lab/icons/flags/. Upload it and move on.
5.	 In the "No-picture" image box, you will need to provide a graphic that PrestaShop 
will use when no product image is available. If you always provide an image, this can 
be anything. If you regularly have missing pictures, a "picture coming soon" in the 
language you are enabling will suffice.
6.	 Make sure there is a nice green tick for the Status setting, and then click on Save.
7.	 But PrestaShop cannot speak another language yet! We need to download a 
language pack from PrestaShop. The language packs are on the same page as  
the main PrestaShop download. Go grab your language pack(s) now from  
http://www.PrestaShop.com/en/downloads/.

Chapter 4
[ 97 ]
8.	 Now hover over Localization tab and click on the Localization. In the Import 
localization pack section, browse to the language pack you just downloaded and 
click on Import.
9.	 Click on the Languages subtab again and make sure your new language is enabled.
10.	Now click on the Modules subtab, scroll down to Language block, and install it.
11.	Visit your shop front. Notice that you have some little flags that enable your 
customers to choose their preferred language. It is important that you explore your 
shop front in detail. How widely used your new language is might depend upon the 
extent to which the language pack covers all aspects of your shop. Any translations 
that have not been done and any extra translations that you would like to be done 
for your site are talked about in the next guide.
What just happened?
You just went global! Well, sort of. If your language pack did not translate everything you 
wanted, it is not the end of the world. If your product is niche enough, you might still get 
some sales. If you need to translate even more, then read on.
Now we can go on and explore how to add more translations for key parts of your PrestaShop.
Creating translations
To see the extent of the translations so far, hover over the Localization tab, click on 
Translations, and in the box labeled Modify translations, select the area that you want to 
translate and click on the flag of your new language. Now go to the section that you want 
translated and click on Expand all fieldsets, or choose a specific one. You will be able to see  
a complete list of all the translations.
For many languages, there are upwards of 500 translations that can be done for you—an 
example of the power of the open source community. Imagine the cost of paying someone 
to translate just a few languages. PrestaShop gives it to you for nothing and you don't even 
have to say thanks.
Notice that on this page, you can easily add or change the translations. However, there is  
one very significant area that is not translated at all! That is our product descriptions. The 
next Time for action section will show you how to do this. But before we dive in, let's look at 
how to translate from our native language to a new language.
Perhaps (obviously) it would be helpful if you have somebody who speaks both languages. 
But assuming that you don't, and you don't want to get your wallet out, here is a cheap, not 
totally reliable, but potentially profitable trick.

[ 98 ]
Please note that we will be using a translation service that is free but not totally accurate. 
If you are translating something where inaccuracy could cause a problem, don't use this 
method. For example, it is probably okay to risk details of a teddy bear getting mixed up in 
translation, but the firing instructions for a new range of rocket-propelled grenades would 
clearly be problematic.
After this guide, I will point out how this very simple method can be used to translate almost 
all aspects of your PrestaShop store.
Time for action – translating product descriptions
1.	 Log in to your PrestaShop back office.
2.	 Hover over the Catalog tab and find the first product that you would like to 
translate. Click on the Edit icon and then click on the flag next to the Title box. 
Notice that since we've added a new language, you have an extra option to change 
the language.
3.	 Now we need to redo all the description and title fields in our new language. Let's go 
over and use Google Translate to help us. Visit http://translate.google.com/.
4.	 Select your "from" and "to" languages in the drop-down box, and copy and paste, 
individually, the descriptions and titles you want translated. Click on Translate, and 
copy and paste the translations back into their respective fields on the PrestaShop 
product page. A quick tip: as already mentioned, this is far from perfect. Consider 
shortening and simplifying the product descriptions. Click on Save when you're done.
5.	 Go and look at your shop front, change the setting to your new language, and check 
out the product description.
What just happened?
When we saved the product, PrestaShop kept the original product information and 
descriptions as well as all the new information and descriptions we provided for the new 
language. PrestaShop will show customers the product description relevant to their choice  
of language.
What is important to realize is that if you see a flag anywhere on your PrestaShop site, you 
can click on it and add a translation. Also, meta tags, categories, and even whole articles in 
the CMS can have translations added in this way.
You might be wondering why we should settle for such imperfection. Some would say 
amateurism, simply because it works and it costs nothing to try. If you find you are getting 
significant numbers of customers from a particular country, then it might be time to show 
proper respect to their language and get your wallet out. Visit www.elance.com and check 
out their outsourcing website. You often get great deals on translation. But beware. There 
are great translators and not-so-great translators.

Chapter 4
[ 99 ]
Time for action – translating your whole website
Here's how to do it:
1.	 Revisit your home page via Google Translate. Highlight and copy the URL of your 
translated home page.
2.	 Click on the Modules subtab and scroll down to the Home text editor module. Click 
on Configure.
3.	 At the very top of your home page, add the flag of the language of your choice. Now 
highlight the flag in the editor and click on the link button.
4.	 Paste the translated URL into the box shown below the labeled Link URL.
5.	 Save your new home page and visit your shop front to try it out.
What just happened?
Your customers can now switch to a completely translated version of your store. You can, of 
course, offer buttons for multiple language options.
Languages conclusion
As previously discussed, if you want to be successful with one or more new languages, it 
might be worth paying for professional translation. But why not go one stage further? If you 
find you have tapped a lucrative market in another country, why not start a website hosted 
in that country, with a domain extension specific to that country, which uses their language 
primarily? Have a look at Chapter 9, Go... to the Future and read about duplication, if this is 
of interest to you.
Pop quiz – PrestaShop search
Q1. If you have a range of products, say teddy bears, and you want to make sure that the 
search results for teddy bear show at the top, and you want this page to list all the teddies  
in the teddy category (and not just individual teddy pages), how would you do this?
1.	 By adding tags to every product under the teddy category.
2.	 By setting weights in the Search section under the Preferences tab.
3.	 Creating a sitemap file and linking it with Google Webmaster Tools.

[ 100 ]
Q2. How does the robots.txt file protect the private areas of your PrestaShop store?
1.	 Adding the following line to the file: Disallow: [Path].
2.	 It is not possible to do this with robots.txt; the changes have to be done  
in PrestaShop.
3.	 Adding the following line to the file: NoAllow: [Path].
Summary
You might be getting quite excited about your new PrestaShop store. The features and 
procedures that you have completed in this chapter together make for a very significantly 
optimized store. I have seen countless web stores, even some of the big names, that do not 
have anything like the SEO options that you now have enabled.
Now, this doesn't mean that this alone will suddenly bring a flood of visitors; it doesn't  
work like that. I can guarantee you that you have taken the very significant initial steps 
towards having a store that is approved of by humans and search engines alike. And in a  
later chapter, we will turn on the tap to begin the eventual flood of visitors. SEO should 
definitely be an ongoing project and I recommend further reading. A good place to start  
is a website that discusses SEO in a specifically PrestaShop context. Check out  
www.presto-changeo.com and have a look at some of the SEO tips and tricks. Also  
visit the PrestaShop forum at www.PrestaShop.com where they have a section dedicated 
to all things PrestaShop and SEO.
Specifically, we covered:


Choosing the best keywords: Deciding on an overall keyword strategy


Meta tags: What they are and how to benefit from them


URLs: All about canonical and friendly URLs


Writing and displaying great articles

Other SEO stuff: Aliases, sitemaps, robots.txt, and search weightings

Adding new languages to our PrestaShop site
Now it is time to look at more customization options as well as some of the lesser-spotted 
PrestaShop features, but let's talk about that in the next chapter.

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income,  
and Statistics
In this chapter we will cover as many PrestaShop features as possible. As I 
mentioned earlier, there is so much to PrestaShop. This is an attempt to bring 
the best of it to your attention.
First we will explore the Preferences and Advanced Parameters tabs and then 
go on to some more great stuff like newsletters and product notifications. Then 
we will look at Google AdSense. This is a way of making extra income through 
advertisers with just a couple of clicks.
Then we will take our first look at statistics. I would say our first look because 
we will just introduce the concept and set them up. In Chapter 9, Go… To the 
Future, we will see how to start using the statistics you gather. We will set up 
the fabulously rich PrestaShop statistics features and the free-to-use Google 
Analytics.
In this chapter, we are going to:
• 
Look at the most useful things on the Preferences tab
• 
Explore the best stuff on the Advanced Parameters tab
• 
Set up a newsletter and notifications system
• 
Talk about running an e-mail marketing campaign
• 
Set up PrestaShop statistics
• 
Set up Google Analytics
So let's get on with it...

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 102 ]
Exploring the Preferences tab
The options available under Preferences are very diverse. Some you might never want to use 
while others might work wonders for your business.
Next is a whirlwind tour of some of the options under Preferences. Each option described 
tells you quickly where it is and what it does. For brevity, I have left a few lesser (in my 
opinion) options out, and for sanity, I will not mention any that we have already looked at.  
So here we go…
Useful preferences
These are the best things you will find under the Preferences tab that have not been covered 
already and will not be covered later in the book.
General
If you want to give an extra security to your website and your web hosting has an SSL 
certificate, then you can enable it here and increase the front office security.
Also you can enable a multistore like we saw previously in the Chapter 2, Back Office.
Orders
Here you could set up the orders through a five-step process, by default, or you could choose 
a shorter way to do a checkout only in one step.
Also here you can set up a minimum purchase, guest checkout, or gift-wrapping.
Cart redisplay at login
What if PrestaShop could remember customers who had products in their cart, but didn't 
buy those products? This sounds like a good idea to me because you might get a sale from it. 
This functionality is in Customers under the Preferences tab
Store contacts
Fill out all the contact details for your store. PrestaShop will automatically add relevant 
information accordingly.

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
E-mail
The settings on this subtab are usually best left alone. The default settings of Use PHP  
mail() function and Both are typical to almost all shared hosting environments. If, however, 
you were running your PrestaShop from a server on your PC at home, you could choose 
Set my own SMTP parameters and configure PrestaShop to use your ISPs e-mail service 
and your own e-mail address. When hosting with a professional host, you could also use 
the SMTP service provided by your web host, but in most situations, this would be an 
unnecessary complication.
Leaving the Both option selected will give your customers the choice of receiving simple text 
e-mails or formatted HTML e-mails.
Image
Use these settings to customize the look and feel of your store.
Localization
Choose lbs, kg, or any other unit of measurement that suits you.
Maintenance
If you need to fix something in your shop, probably you will need to activate this.
Administration
Every tool has either been covered or will be covered in a specific section of the book. 
However, there are two tools that don't fall in any appropriate topic category. They are  
great for personalizing and customizing your admin control panel. These are Menus and 
Quick Access.

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 104 ]
Menus
Do you feel some of the tabs are in the wrong place? No problem. You can move and create 
as many tabs and subtabs as you like. So if you want to group different subtabs under 
different main tabs because that is convenient for you, then this is how to do it.
Time for action – customizing your tabs
As an example, we will move the main Orders tab and make it a subtab of Customers:
1.	 Click on Administration and then on Menus.
2.	 Click on the edit icon under Actions for the Orders tab in the Name list.
3.	 We are going to change the Parent value from Catalog to Customers. This means 
that the Orders tab will be moved to a subtab of Customers instead of Catalog  
(a main tab). So click on the drop-down list and select Customers.

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
4.	 That's it. Click on the Customers tab and then on the newly positioned Orders tab. 
Notice that all the subtabs of Orders have moved with it. That is because although 
you have only moved the Orders tab, it remains the parent for all its subtabs.
What just happened?
This feature might not be of any use to you. But imagine your business grows and you need to 
employ someone to perform one specific task. Perhaps you will need someone to write articles 
or do all the customer service and packing. In that case, you can easily create a single tab with 
all the features they need and then restrict their username to only that particular tab. This 
would avoid the risk of them accidentally changing settings (which you don't want them to). 
We will look at this and other security features in Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery.
Quick access
Remember the quick access drop-down list? Do they go where you want them to? Here is 
how to make more. I will make a quick access to the database backup facility, which we will 
use in the next chapter while making a copy of your store.

Time for action – creating a Quick access
Here is how to do it:
1.	 Click on the Administration tab and then on Quick Access.
2.	 Now click on the Add new button (with the + sign).
3.	 For the Name value, type Database backup.
4.	 For the URL value, type index.php?controller=AdminBackup.
5.	 Save your changes and try out your new quick access.
If you are looking to make your own quick accesses, then you are probably wondering how 
to get the value for the URL field. Go to the tab you are making the quick access and copy 
the URL on your browser. Then delete everything before index.php and everything from 
&token. I have copied the following database backup URL and highlighted the parts to 
delete so that you can see exactly what to delete and what to use:
http:/shop.com/adminpassword123456/index.php?controller=AdminBacku
p&token=37a0e13f7
What just happened?
We made a quick access shortcut to the database backup feature. You can make quick access 
shortcuts to anything that is useful to you. The database backup feature is something that 
should be used regularly and we will discuss it in Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery.
Let's see how much you have learned, remembered, and what you can work out by yourself.

Pop quiz – tools and preferences challenge
Here are a number of questions about what you can do on the Advanced Parameters, 
Administration, and Preferences tabs. Just to make things more interesting, there are 
questions that deal with the previous chapters as well as this one.
Q1. How would you configure PrestaShop e-mail messages to be sent from your personal ISP 
account when you are running PrestaShop on your own PC?
1.	 It is not possible.
2.	 With an external SMTP server.
3.	 By selecting Use PHP mail() function. Recommended; works in most cases.
4.	 With a local SMTP server.
Q2. How can you reorder the main tabs?
1.	 By dragging-and-dropping them
2.	 By clicking on Menus under the Administration tab
3.	 By clicking on General under the Preferences tab
4.	 By clicking on SEO & URLs under the Preferences tab
Q3. We looked briefly at the database backup feature. Is backing up the database enough to 
ensure that you have everything you need to recover from a disaster?
1.	 Yes, PrestaShop does everything for us
2.	 Yes, but PrestaShop does a back up only for one table
3.	 No, PrestaShop has no right to run these kind of commands
4.	 No, but there is a module to do it
E-mail marketing with newsletters
We will discuss marketing in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell and Chapter 9, Go… To the Future. 
However, newsletters, or e-mail marketing, is a special case. That is why it is worth 
discussing it here before we cover other marketing optionsin PrestaShop.
E-mail marketing is not just another type of marketing. In my opinion, it is absolutely crucial 
to maximize the potential of any online business. E-mail marketing with newsletters is a kind 
of catchall to make all other forms of marketing worthwhile. What do I mean by this?

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 108 ]
E-mail marketing can support every other type of marketing you are doing. Think about all 
the different sources your website will eventually receive its visitors from – search engines 
due to your SEO efforts, paid adverts, link building, and social media marketing. If any of 
those phrases are alien to you, don't worry. They are all dealt with in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell 
and Chapter 9, Go… To the Future. The point to grasp here is that all the other methods when 
used on their own are actually prone to failure.
Most people don't buy!
It's true. A vast majority of visits to your shop do not generate a sale. If you manage to 
achieve 10 percent your visits, you have done incredibly well. There are chances that the 
actual figure is nearer to 5 percent or lower. If we were working in a retail shop and 19 out 
of 20 customers we spoke to walked out with nothing, then we probably wouldn't last long 
before we had to find another job.
So this means we are expecting to fail 95 percent of the time. Now assuming that you have 
written a great sales copy, also provided compelling informational content, and have set up 
your PrestaShop correctly and smartly, there is still a little more you can do on your website 
itself. And it is probably not the fault of your website that 95 percent of your visitors kept 
their wallets firmly in their pockets.
Why?
So why do 95 percent of your visitors leave without spending? There are lots of reasons—they 
aren't ready to buy, they want to do more research or they are looking to find a better price 
or service, and there are many more reasons as well. And what makes things worse is that 
when the customers have put things right in their minds and they finally have their wallet out, 
they are unlikely to remember your website. So we have to, as much as possible, remove this 
element of chance.
What if you could constantly remind your future potential customer? What if you could help 
them arrive at a buying decision? What if you could improve your relationship and warm up 
your potential customers with interesting and relevant industry or product information? You 
guessed it right, that's where e-mail marketing comes in. All the other forms of marketing bring 
people to your site—a small percentage will buy and e-mail marketing takes care of the rest.
Of course, you have to get the e-mail addresses of all these people and their permission to 
be contacted. And when you send e-mails, they must contain high quality compelling content 
to sell them your products.

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
The stages of e-mail marketing
First we will look at how to start building a list of potential customers with the PrestaShop 
newsletter module. Then we will look at different ways to build that list as quickly as possible, 
and also capturing a high percentage of visitors. Then we will look at actually sending product 
notifications through PrestaShop alerts. Next we will look at a range of methods—PrestaShop 
and some more—for actually managing your list of names and your e-mail campaigns.
Setting up the newsletter module
This is how we will begin to collect the e-mail addresses of willing subscribers. This brief 
tutorial creates a simple form for customers to enter their details and start receiving your 
e-mails. Like most things in PrestaShop, this is also a breeze. Follow the quick tutorial below.
Time for action – the newsletter module
A couple of clicks is all it takes:
1.	 Click on the Modules tab, scroll down to the Newsletter block, installed by default. 
Be careful to configure the Newsletter block located in the Front Office Features 
category and not Newsletter in the Analytics & Stats or Administration category. 
We will look at the latter when we start sending e-mails/newsletters.
2.	 Scroll back down and click on Configure. Select the box for sending a  
confirmation. Then your new subscriber will get a very brief message confirming 
they have subscribed.
What just happened?
Go and have a look at the newsletter subscription block that your customers will see:
Now we can go on to explore other e-mail communication topics.

Switching on product notifications
Product notifications are different than newsletters but are a related topic. Switching on 
product notifications gives customers the option of receiving e-mails when out-of-stock 
products come back into stock. This works for actual customers who specifically request  
it, not newsletter subscribers, so it is still worth including new products and specials in  
your newsletters. We will talk more about newsletters in a minute. Now let's turn on  
product notifications.
Time for action – product notifications
Here is how to do it.
1.	 Click on the Modules tab, scroll down to Mail alerts and install it.
2.	 Scroll back down to the module and click on Configure.
3.	 Make sure all of the boxes are checked.

What just happened?
You just provided a useful service for your customers.
Now back to e-mail marketing and newsletters for real. We will look at how to get lots of 
subscribers, create great e-mails, and then the different options available to send them. 
Another cool way to make your customers remember your shop is to allow them to configure 
their own reminder events Also, remember to tick the field New order, to receive a notification 
when an order is placed.
Powerful newsletter modules
Newsletters are a good way to keep in touch with your customers because it is quite 
important to do so.
I recommend Mailchimp for Prestashop module. If you do not know about Mailchimp, it is 
a professional newsletter service with a different range of price, starting for free. You can 
download it for free from their official website at http://connect.mailchimp.com/
integrations/mailchimp-module-for-prestashop-free
Building a big list of subscribers
Now that your subscription block is ready to roll, let's look at a few ways of getting more 
subscribers from our visitors.
Understanding what a newsletter is
Before sending newsletters to your subscribers you need to understand what is a newsletter, 
because it can cause a negative impact on your subscribers. Try not bothering your 
subscribers because your e-mails could be category for a spam. If your newsletters focus 
on your shop and offer something else, such as discounts, new products, then it will be 
welcomed by most subscribers.
Incentives
Offer something for free if they sign up to your newsletter. Mention the free gift in your articles 
and the home page or other prominent pages. Here are some ideas for what to give away.
What to give away
Think hard about your products, business, and industry. What would be really useful? If you 
are selling an information, music, or video product, it's easy. Perhaps offer a sample chapter, 
song, application, or video. If not that, why not create a downloadable PDF or a short video 
made on a webcam capturing the most compelling and useful information related to your 
products, business, or industry?

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 112 ]
Here is another idea that might work for almost any business. Offer a free software 
download. Even if your website is not software related, you can always find great  
softwares that you can give away which has some connection with your industry.  
Visit www.sourceforge.net and find something suitable for your business.
If you're really stuck with incentives, offer a discount voucher. Consider very carefully before 
doing it because it needs to be viable financially. But what could be better way of making 
someone revisit your store?
Offering more via e-mail
Write a really great article. You can then offer it as a reward for signing up. The other way 
(though a bit sneaky, it does work)—write another cool article but only publish part of it. 
Then offer the conclusion or vital final bit of information when they subscribe.
Okay, let's assume we will have hordes of subscribers. We now need to make some 
newsletters worth receiving.
Creating newsletters
As with all your articles, you need to write interesting content that people actually want 
to read. The same rules apply for writing a great article for your website, but a newsletter 
needs more than just an article. You could use one or more of the following.
Product information
This is just what it says. The very best buys, newest additions, or hottest products from  
your industry.
Genuine news
Tell your readers about significant developments in the world of your niche. The hundredth 
annual teddy bear's picnic, or whatever is important to your visitors.
Designing your newsletters
You are probably beginning to see that this topic is getting quite deep and there are lots of 
possibilities that can't be discussed here. How about this?
If your shop covers a relatively unchanging niche, such as teddy bears, then you probably 
know enough to get going. Write a new article following all the guidelines from Chapter 4, 
Getting More Customers. Put your company logo at the top and a special offer or two at the 
bottom and read on about how to send them. Mailchimp has a thousands of templates that you 
can modify according to your company for free.

Chapter 5
[ 113 ]
If, on the other hand, your niche is a dynamic one with enthusiasts or lots of opinions, then 
this is where you can really capitalize on a great newsletter. You can send multiple newsletters 
with a different focus on the main types and format, and arrange them in many different ways 
to entice customers and maintain your readership. If this describes your niche, then it is worth 
putting a bit more effort and thought into the design, content, and type of your newsletter.
Now you have an idea of how to create a great e-mail newsletter. But how are you going to 
send it?
Sending newsletters
Of course, once you have created interesting content and formatted it beautifully, you need 
to send it. Here are a number of ways you can do this—some free and some requiring the 
dreaded wallet.
A quick word about spam
This is a complicated issue and varies greatly from country to country and in the US from 
state to state. In some places, you can do what you like, while in others, you could end up  
in jail for breaking one of the numerous communication or data protection laws. Here are a 
few rules:
• 
Never buy or borrow a list of e-mail addresses unless you are 100 percent 
certain that they have been gathered legitimately and all the recipients have 
signed up for e-mails from third parties (that is, you)
• 
Never add someone to your newsletter without their specific request
• 
Never use a person's e-mail after they have unsubscribed, no matter how much 
you think they might want to receive just one more
• 
Always include instructions to unsubscribe in every email
You need to be wary that even if you comply with all the laws and my guidelines mentioned 
above, where spam is concerned, the customer's perception is an important one. If a recipient 
thinks that the e-mail you have sent is a trash or doesn't identify it with the company he had 
signed up with, even if he had subscribed, he might click the Mark as spam button.
If this happens too often, then their ISP could mark your domain as spam. If you keep your 
content good and not too commercial as well as have a clear and easy unsubscribe process, 
then you should be able to avoid this.
Using a PrestaShop module to send newsletters
As you might expect, there is a PrestaShop module for sending e-mails to your subscribers 
direct from your PrestaShop admin area. This is a quick download and is as easy to install as 
any other PrestaShop module.

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 114 ]
As you know by now though, I don't like spending money! This module costs $64.80. If 
you want utter simplicity and $64.80 is not important to you, then you can go and buy the 
module from www.prestaworks.com.
If, like me, you don't want to get your wallet out, then read on. There are a number of ways to 
do it for free as well as point you in the direction of some pay-for services that can add extra 
frills to you newsletter campaigns. And because of the excellent PrestaShop facility to export a 
list of your subscribers, it is almost as easy as doing it through the PrestaShop module.
Using your web host to send newsletters
Most web hosts offer an e-mail marketing package or a script that you can add to your site. I 
have never seen one that is both adequate and free (included with web hosting). Most either 
lack features or come with significant costs per month. However, have a look before you get 
your wallet out.
A dedicated e-mail service provider to send newsletters
You can take up a new service with companies like Aweber (www.aweber.com) and 
MailChimp (www.mailchimp.com), and get a very easy-to-use and fully-featured service.
The big downside with these companies is that as your list grows, so does your expenses.  
Go and have a look at what these companies offer, but think carefully before getting your 
wallet out.
A free e-mail system to send newsletters
Just what the doctor ordered! There is one that is fully-featured, fully–supported, and free. 
phpList is one of the several but is probably the best open source e-mail list management 
software system.
You can install it on your web host and then work through all the phases of starting and running 
an e-mail marketing campaign using phpList. It can help you build a list, create professional 
newsletters/e-mails, send them, manage replies, and give you statistical feedback.
phpList is very extensive and therefore cannot be explained fully in a few paragraphs here, but 
if you have decided that your e-mail/newsletter campaign is going to be an important part of 
your marketing strategy without paying extra money, this can be your solution.
Getting your subscriber list
Whichever option you choose, you will need your list of subscribers. Here is how to get the 
list in a text file so that you can copy and paste them into your preferred sending method.

Chapter 5
[ 115 ]
Time for action – accessing your e-mail list
We will use the PrestaShop admin area to create a .CSV file that can be used to copy and 
paste all your subscribers into your preferred system.
1.	 Click on the Modules tab and scroll down to the Newsletter module and click on 
Install. This module is in the Administration category.
2.	 Now click on Configure.

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 116 ]
3.	 You have two buttons where you can click to export a .CSV file.
4.	 The first will export a list of everybody who signed up using your newsletter  
signup block.
5.	 The second exports a list of everyone who has created a customer account. Notice 
here that you have some options for filtering/customizing the second list. You have 
the option to select a specific country or all countries. You also have the option to 
choose subscribers or non-subscribers from opted-in customers and newsletter 
subscribers. This is important. Never send newsletters to anybody who has not 
subscribed. You will get a bad reputation, end up on ISP block lists, and in some 
parts of the world you might even be prosecuted.
6.	 So select your country or all countries and then select subscribers in both  
drop-down boxes.
7.	 Now click on each of the Export .CSV file buttons. The data is displayed in a new 
browser window. You can copy and paste from there or save it to a Windows 
Notepad document.
What just happened?
You now have a text file to use in your preferred e-mail system.
Now some people who visit your site, read your articles, and receive your free newsletter 
will never buy anything. Wouldn't it be nice if we could find a way of making a little bit of 
revenue from them? You can, with Google AdSense.
Setting up Google AdSense in PrestaShop
As with just about everything in PrestaShop, implementing Google AdSense has been nice 
and easy. Follow the quick Time for action section below to start earning from clicks.
Time for action – installing Google AdSense
1.	 Click on the Modules tab. Install the GAdsense module.
2.	 Click on Configure.
3.	  Paste the code that you had from AdSense for Content and click on Update 
settings. If you haven't the AdSense code yet, you can have it from  
https://www.google.com/adsense.

Chapter 5
[ 117 ]
4.	 Wait for half an hour and visit your shop front to see the advert.
What just happened?
Your adverts will start running fairly soon. A quick word of warning, just in case you didn't 
read Google's terms and conditions. One key thing to remember is that you must never ever 
click on your own adverts. Google will pick up on this and will not give you many chances 
before it does something really annoying.
Setting up PrestaShop statistics
Now you are up and running (or at least you're in the starting blocks) and it is a good time to 
consider a way to measure the success of your site. If you can't take measurements, you won't 
know whether the things you're doing is right or wrong. This and the next section will introduce 
two schemes for achieving this. First, as the heading suggests, is PrestaShop statistics.
PrestaShop statistics, in my opinion, are unrivalled in free software. The depth of information 
and richness of presentation are literally second to none. As if this were not enough, 
PrestaShop statistics is an absolute breeze to set up.

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 118 ]
Graph and grid engines
These are the parts of PrestaShop that power the presentation of the statistics. Depending 
upon which engine you choose, the graph or chart you are using will be presented a bit 
differently. Or you could switch them all off and just view the basic manner in which 
PrestaShop presents things.
One way I suggest is to switch all of them on because you can flip between the different 
engines while viewing statistics and then decide what you like best. Then you can turn off  
the ones that are unnecessary. We will do this in a Time for action section shortly.
Statistics modules
These are the different modules that present and collect statistics that you can use to find 
interesting or useful information about your store. As with engines, a good way of exploring 
these is to switch them all on, and then go to explore them. We will do this in the next Time 
for action. However, we will not go too deeply into how you can actually use them until we 
look at analyzing statistics in Chapter 9, Go… To the Future. For now we will just familiarize 
ourselves with what is available.
So let's do it.
Time for action – setting up statistics engines and modules
As I mentioned earlier, we will switch everything on:
1.	 Click on the Modules tab. Scroll down to the Analytics and Stats section and install 
the first one. Repeat this until they are all installed. There is no configuration 
required for any of these. By default PrestaShop has the most important ones 
installed.
2.	 Click on the Home option in the Quick Access drop-down list. Now you have a quick 
statistical summary on your admin home page.
3.	 Now click on the Stats tab. Notice that there are lot of things to explore. This is what 
we will do now.
What just happened?
Now your website will begin to gather statistics and you can then make meaningful decisions 
based on what they tell you.

Chapter 5
[ 119 ]
Exploring the statistics options
Let's have a brief explanation of the main options that appear on the Stats tab; if your store 
has no customers yet, then you won't be able to see much:
Visits and Visitors
Helps you to know how many returning visitors 
you have by comparing the number of visits by 
unique visitors.
Sales and orders
Gives a lot of sales information.
Customer accounts
This is useful stuff. It tells you how many 
registered customers are there from a particular 
time period. It also tell you how many customers 
gave up during registration or registered, but 
decided not to buy.
Registered Customer Info
This option will give you some useful customer 
demographics. These include age, sex, country, 
and currency.
Visitors online
This helps to see if there are people browsing 
your shop, what they are looking at, and most 
importantly, whether they have something in 
their cart. This module can distinguish between a 
regular visitor and a logged-in customer.
Best vouchers
This tells you about the vouchers you have 
created and how well they do. We will cover more 
on vouchers in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.
Best customers
Tells you which customers spent the most.
Visitors origin
Tells you which search engines and websites sent 
visitors to you.
Pages not found
This lists URLs that people have attempted to 
access but were not found. This is useful for 
finding potential linking problems.
Search engine keywords
Find out which keywords brought traffic to your 
site.
Product details
This gives you a quick summary of products and 
stock levels.
Best products
This option provides a league table of best-selling 
products.
Best categories
Just as it says—it lists the categories that do the 
best in your shop.
Best suppliers
Says which suppliers supply the best-selling 
products.

Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics
[ 120 ]
Carrier distribution
A detailed look at the different carrier services 
your customers choose.
Shop search
This provides a league table of search terms used 
in your shop and how often they have been used. 
This can be really useful for picking new aliases 
and other things as well.
Installing Google Analytics
It has to be said that Google Analytics is really quite impressive. If you want to know (and 
as a switched-on web master, you would want to know) who visited your site, where they 
live, what operating system and browser they have, what pages they visited, how long they 
stayed, where they got the link to your site from, what websites are sending you visitors, and 
much more, then Google Analytics is for you! And what does it cost? Absolutely nothing!
Getting a Google Analytics account
Go to http://www.google.com/analytics/ and click on Sign Up Now. Follow the 
simple instructions to open an Analytics account.
The budding e-commerce entrepreneur is often left trawling forums with contradictory 
comments or advice based on an old version of Analytics. And then there was PrestaShop.
Have a go hero – doing more with the thing
Have a go at this. Make sure that you have signed up for Google Analytics already and then 
have a go at this challenge. Also make sure that you are logged into PrestaShop and your 
Analytics account. Now hold your breath. Can you install Google Analytics in PrestaShop 
without breathing? [Only joking! Please do not try this at home! We take no responsibility 
for the consequences if you actually do this.]
Time for action – installing Google Analytics
Just perform the following steps and ignore Google's additional warnings and instructions 
because PrestaShop is different. Go!
1.	 In your Analytics account, click on Add Website Profile and type in your domain 
name.
2.	 Note the Web Property ID in the Tracking Status Information box.

Chapter 5
[ 121 ]
3.	 In PrestaShop, click on the Modules tab. Scroll to the Analytics and Stats category 
and install the ganalytics module.
4.	 Scroll back down to the Google Analytics module and click on Configure.
5.	 Enter your Analytics Web Property ID in the box and click on Save.
6.	 Breathe.
7.	 If this is not your book and your partner has a blue face and their head on their 
keyboard, please call an ambulance. Please note the publisher and the author 
accepts no responsibility for death or serious injury while reading this book.
What just happened?
Tracking has now been installed. Data will be gathered and you would have meaningful 
statistics in around 24 hours. We will cover much more on statistics in Chapter 9,  
Go… To the Future.
Using Google Analytics
Just log in to your Analytics account and have a look. Click on some of the options and 
suboptions in the main menu on the left-hand side. There won't be any data there yet, but 
as you can see there is an abundance of possibilities. In Chapter 9, Go… To the Future, we 
will discuss in detail a plan to make your PrestaShop a roaring success, with Google Analytics 
playing a big part in it.

Summary
We learned a lot in this chapter. It was probably the most diverse chapter. A sort of mopping 
up, if you like, to make sure we appreciate the diversity PrestaShop has to offer before we 
move on.
Specifically, we covered the following topics:
• 
We now have a very good knowledge of the Preferences tab.
• 
The Advanced Parameters and Administration tabs have been explored.
• 
We have a good understanding of e-mail/newsletter campaigns and our 
different options for implementing them.
• 
We have a range of powerful tools for analyzing statistics. We also looked at the 
range of data available but put off actually analyzing anything until Chapter 9, 
Go… To the Future.
Now how would you feel if after all this work your web host had a catastrophe and you lost 
the lot? That really would be a bad day! So without any delay we will move on to the next 
chapter and look at security, backing up your store, and recovering from a disaster.

6
Security and Disaster Recovery
In this chapter, we will do everything possible to make sure that our store 
does not become the victim of a successful attack. Fortunately, the PrestaShop 
team takes security very seriously and issues updates and fixes as soon as any 
problems are discovered.
We just have to make sure we do everything we can and implement the 
PrestaShop upgrades as soon as they are available. All this is covered in this 
chapter.
It is also vital for us to always have a recent copy of our store because one day 
our shop might die on us; it is probably inevitable. It might be a hacker, or we 
might accidentally muck it up ourselves. A recent backup to handle this type of 
event is a minor inconvenience, because without one, it could be an expensive 
catastrophe.
In this chapter, we shall:


Look at ways in which your shop can be damaged


Add users, profiles, and permissions to increase security


Talk about and optionally implement SSL to protect your customers' private 
information


Learn how to back up and restore your shop in case everything else fails


Talk about upgrading PrestaShop and how this helps in keeping your business secure
So let's get on with it...

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 124 ]
Types of attacks
There are different types of security attacks. Here is a very brief explanation of some of 
the most common ones. Hopefully, this will help to clarify why security is an ongoing and 
evolving issue and not something that can ever be 100 percent solved out-of-the-box.
Common sense issues
These are often overlooked. Make sure your passwords are impossible to guess; use  
number sequences that are memorizable to you but unimaginable and meaningless to 
everyone else. Combine number sequences with a variety of upper and lower case letters. 
Don't share your passwords with anyone. This applies to anyone who has access to your 
shop or hosting account.
Brute force
This is when an attacker uses software to repeatedly attempt to gain access to or discover 
a password by guessing. Clearly, the simplest defense against this is a secure password. A 
good password is one with upper and lower case characters, apparently random numbers, 
and words that are not names or can be found in the dictionary. Does your administrator 
password stand up to these criteria?
SQL injection attack
A malicious person can amend, delete, or retrieve information from your database by 
cleverly manipulating the forms or database requests contained in PrestaShop code. By 
appending this to legitimate PrestaShop database code, harm can be done or breaches of 
security can be achieved.
Cross-site scripting
Attackers add instructions to access code on another site. They do this by appending a URL 
(pointing to malicious code) to a PHP URL of a legitimate page on your site.
User error
This is straight forward. It is likely that while developing or amending your website, you will 
mess up some or perhaps all of your PrestaShop store. I did it once while writing this chapter. 
I will give you the full details of my experiment and my slightly embarrassing confession later.
So with so many ways that things can go wrong, we better start looking at some solutions.

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
Employees and user security
If you plan to employ someone, or if you have a partner who is going to help with your new 
shop, it makes good sense to create a new user account so that they have their own login 
details. Even if it will be only you who needs to use the PrestaShop control panel, there is still 
a good argument for creating two or more accounts. Here's why.
First we will consider a scenario, though a slightly exaggerated one:


Bikes4U.com
Bikes4U wants to offer articles about how to use its products. The management, 
probably correctly, believe that in-depth how-tos about all its products will boost 
sales and increase customer retention.
The diverse nature of their products makes employing a single writer impossible. For 
example, an expert on mountain bikes will rarely be an expert on unicycles. And a 
user of folding bikes probably won't know about clipless pedals.
This is quite a problem. The management decides they need a way to allow a whole 
team of freelance writers who can login directly to the PrestaShop CMS. But bearing 
in mind the highly dubious backgrounds some of these writers will have, how can 
they be trusted in the PrestaShop control panel?

Users of Bikes4U.com
Suppose you employ somebody to write articles for you. You don't really want 
them to be able to play with product prices or payment modules. You would want 
to restrict them to the CMS area of the control panel. Similarly, your partner might 
be helping you wrap and pack your products. To avoid accidents, you might like to 
restrict them to the Customers and Orders tab.
Now consider this scenario. Even you, after reading this book, could make a  
mistake. It is a really good idea to create at least one extra user account for  
yourself. I always make myself a wrapping and packing account. I use it all the time, 
and it is reassuring to know that I can't accidentally click on anything that can cause 
a problem.
This type of user security is common in large organizations. On a company intranet, 
employees will almost always be restricted to areas of the company system which 
they need, and nothing more.
The following Time for action section shows you how to create a new user account; after 
that, we will look at profiles and permissions to enforce the restrictions suitable to us.
Okay, now let's create a new user.

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 126 ]
Time for action – creating users
As you have come to expect, this is really easy.
1.	 Hover over the Administration tab, click on Employees, and then click on the Add 
new button.
2.	 Enter the information of your new employee or user in the required fields.
3.	 The Status box enables you to allow or disallow access to the new employee. Unless 
you have a reason for creating an account for an employee and not letting them use 
it, select the radio button for the green check mark. If you have reason to want to 
stop your new employee or user from accessing your control panel, simply come 
back to this page and select the red cross mark.
4.	 In the Profile drop-down box, choose Administrator to give the new user full access. 
We will investigate when this is a good idea and when you might like to change it; 
for example, if you're adding a freelance writer next.
5.	 Click on the Save button to create the new user account.

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
What just happened?
The new user can now log in to the control panel and perform any task.
Profiles
This section on profiles and the next topic, Permissions, are very closely linked to users. A 
profile is like a position. You can create a profile and assign responsibilities and restrictions. 
The administrator profile created by default can do everything in the control panel. As we 
discussed previously, this might not be the ideal situation for you.
What we will do now is create a new profile called "customer service". In the next section 
on permissions, we will assign the appropriate permissions to this new profile. Allowing 
all users with the customer service profile to access everything they need to do their job 
and restricting their access to anything that is not part of their job, significantly reduces 
the possibility of accidents or, dare I say it, malicious actions, by a disgruntled employee or 
someone who gains access to their account.
Time for action – creating profiles
We will now create a profile in a couple of steps:
1.	 Hover over the Administration tab and click on Profiles, and subsequently click on 
the green Add new button.
2.	 Type in Customer Service or whatever you want your first profile to be called.
3.	 Click on Save. Now read on about permissions.
What just happened?
We have just created a user profile to which we can assign users. But to make the profile 
meaningful and worthwhile, we will now assign appropriate permissions to it, which are 
explained in the next section.

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 128 ]
Permissions
In the Time for action section that follows, we will assign the permissions that are 
appropriate for an employee with customer service and packing responsibilities. First  
we will take a look at the options in general, for permissions.
Permissions and their levels
There are four types of permissions: View, Add, Edit, and Delete. PrestaShop controls access 
by allowing you to assign these types of permissions to any of the tabs and subtabs.
You can restrict the members of a profile from viewing any tab(s) you like. For example, 
you might not want the customer service profile to change anything on the Payment tab. 
No problem; you can totally remove this tab for the users of that profile. In the Bikes4U 
freelance writer scenario, you may want to create users who only have access to the CMS 
tab. You could do this by removing, or as we will see in a bit, not adding any permissions 
apart from the ones for the CMS tab.
So to stop the users of a particular profile from adding and removing products, you need  
to remove the Add and Delete permissions from the Catalog tab. These users would then  
be able to edit product descriptions, but they will not be able to add or remove products  
by themselves.
The depth of information we have just discussed is almost certainly adequate for any new 
shop, and also if you are an existing business owner and you intend to hand over the running 
of your PrestaShop store to your staff. The key with permissions, profiles, and users is 
planning. Take time to consider your company structure, which users should have access to 
what, and create a profile for each. Once that is done, read on to configure permissions for 
those profiles.
Now that we have looked at the different permissions, you will easily be able to decide which 
ones are the most appropriate for the different profiles you want to make for your shop.
Time for action – configuring permissions to profiles
Of course, the permissions and levels that I've suggested in this Time for action section are 
just my views. You will know best as to what is most appropriate for your business. Let's get 
on with it then.
1.	 Hover over the Administration tab, click on Permissions, and select the Customer 
Service profile, or whatever profile you are configuring from the left-hand side 
menu.

Chapter 6
[ 129 ]
2.	 Take time to examine the tabs and the options associated with them.
3.	 Try adding permissions for one of the tabs. For the freelance writer, I would 
just enable the View functionality for the Tools tab and the View, Add, and Edit 
functionalities for the CMS tab. The reason we need to assign View to Tools is 
because the CMS tab will not be visible otherwise.
4.	 Go back to a user's subtab in Employees, edit the user, and assign the profile you 
have just amended to the user. Now log in as that user and see the changes taking 
effect.
5.	 Now log in again as the administrator and make the rest of the changes you  
decided upon.
What just happened?
You have now created your first profile. It should be simple to create as many profiles as you 
like. Also, don't forget to assign your users to profiles appropriate for them.

Pop quiz – security
Q1. Can you think of a good reason as to why you need to assign permissions to profiles and 
then profiles to users, instead of assigning permissions directly to users?
1.	 In order to be consistent with every profile.
2.	 Because PrestaShop can't handle another way.
3.	 Because there aren't any particular reasons for doing it in this way.
4.	 Because other e-commerce software do it in the same way.
Q2. Taking into account the different types of attacks and other things that can go wrong, 
what do users, profiles, and permissions protect against?
1.	 The deletion of items.
2.	 The deletion of items and changes in the design of our store.
3.	 The changes in the design of our store, addition or deletion of another employee, 
and modification of orders, among others.
4.	 They do not protect our store against anything.
Q3. How can we protect users' login information from being sniffed out by people listening 
for information?
1.	 Using SSL.
2.	 Using FTP.
3.	 Using SMTP.
4.	 Using WWW.
SSL – Secure Sockets Layer
SSL is a cool system or, in tech speak, a protocol for allowing encrypted communication over 
the Internet. The need for this is obvious when you think about the type of information that 
must be given and received, even for the simplest transaction. A customer's personal details 
and credit card details are the most obvious examples of these types of information.
By encrypting (making information incomprehensible to all but the intended recipient), you 
can take your customers' money and personal details without worrying that their private 
details will be intercepted by a third party.

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
Regular encryption relies on the sharing of a decryption key. A decryption key, simply 
speaking, is a mathematical formula for making the incomprehensible information 
comprehensible again. SSL uses a method known as public key cryptography that allows a 
website, such as yours, to give an encryption key to your customer's web browser, which 
encrypts the confidential information before sending it. The SSL web server has a private key 
known only to itself, which can descramble the information and retrieve your customer's 
confidential information.
Shared SSL, dedicated SSL, or no SSL
Shared SSL is usually free. Dedicated SSL, on the other hand, will certainly cost you a few 
dollars per month.
Almost any web server can be configured to be an SSL server. In most hosting environments, 
you will be offered a shared SSL server for free. This is where you have your communications 
re-routed through an SSL-enabled server. The problem is that the SSL server has a different 
address from the server that your website is actually hosted on. PrestaShop has not been 
designed to be able to easily use a shared SSL server.
If, however, you must have SSL and absolutely do not want to get your wallet out to pay  
for a dedicated SSL certificate, then have a read of this article on the PrestaShop forums: 
http://www.prestashop.com/forums/viewthread/19232/.
Do not despair! If you want or need SSL without the technical hassles, then you will need to 
contact your web host and arrange to buy a dedicated SSL certificate for your website. You 
shouldn't need to do anything technical. Just pay, wait for it to be set up, and then follow the 
easy tutorial explained next. PrestaShop will then use https:// instead of http:// as the 
protocol for any relevant page on your website, and your customers will be protected.
So SSL sounds like a good idea. But it is not an absolute must. If you are using PayPal to take 
payments, then all your customers' financial details will be dealt with on the PayPal website 
anyway. And they use their own SSL server, as you would expect. Consider that the name  
and address of your customers is entered on your website. Is this a security problem? Will 
your customers object to their names and addresses being retrieved unencrypted? Only you 
can decide.
Another potential drawback of not using SSL is that your login information to the control 
panel will be left unencrypted. Do you use wireless Internet? Perhaps in a busy location 
with lots of other wireless users, it is possible for somebody to obtain your username and 
password. Then they can do whatever they like with it.
The other consideration with SSL is that more and more customers look for the  
https:// prefix in the address bar when going through checkout. And most web browsers 
display a nice graphical padlock and maybe some other reassuring embellishments like green 
address bars. So even if in your opinion you don't need SSL, it might be worthwhile even if it 
is just for show.

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 132 ]
So decide whether you want shared or dedicated SSL, or none at all. Read the next tutorial 
after setting up SSL with your web host, if you are going to use it.
Setting up SSL in PrestaShop
This is so easy. Many shopping carts require editing of the PHP code in multiple files, even 
for dedicated SSL. Again, well done PrestaShop! Perhaps you can make shared SSL easy in a 
future revision as well.
Time for action – setting up SSL in PrestaShop
Let's do it.
1.	 Hover over the Preferences tab and click on General.
2.	 For the first item in the list of options (Enable SSL), select Yes.
3.	 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Save.
4.	 Now go to your shop front, log in to your account, and notice the https:// at the 
front of the web address in your browser.
What just happened?
Your customers' vital details are now encrypted by SSL. If you are going to use PayPal as your 
payment provider, then the customers' financial details are kept secure by PayPal, even if you 
opted not to use SSL on your website.
Making a copy of your store
We have taken a number of steps to protect your PrestaShop store, but what if it all goes 
wrong anyway? It is still possible, although much less likely, that your site will get hacked. It 
is also possible that we might accidentally spoil our own PrestaShop store. If you promise not 
to tell anyone else, I will give you an example of a self-inflicted disaster I had.
While working on this chapter, I was playing with the Permissions features. I deleted a few 
tabs and then with a single inadvertent click, I deleted the Employees tab! The permissions 
page went blank and there was no way to restore all the tabs that I had deleted. I can't put in 
print what I said when I realized my mistake.
But I had a copy and the page was up and running again in 10 minutes.
A lesson to be taken from this incident is to create a new profile and user for you. Call 
it Junior admin, and then if you do something dumb like I did, you can log in as the 
administrator and make it right.

Chapter 6
[ 133 ]
So our objective for this section is to create an offline, untouchable, and easily usable 
backup. Then no matter what happens, you will be able to get your business up and running 
in around 10 minutes. And no matter how talented and resourceful a hacker is, I guarantee 
that he or she won't be able to get remote access to a CD stored in your locked cupboard!
Introducing the backup process
Two main areas will be covered in these step-by-step tutorials. Coming up next, we will  
back up the PrestaShop database. The database is separate from the files in your web space 
on your web host. It holds information that is accessed by the code contained in  
the PrestaShop files.
The second part of the backup process is obtaining a full copy of the PrestaShop files. This 
is nice and simple, but we will still do it step by step to be 100 percent certain that we are 
never left with a problem that can't be fixed.
Frequency
So how often should you make a backup? It all depends on the frequency of change to 
your store. Let's say you get ten purchasing customers a day. If you backup every week but 
suddenly get hacked just before you do a backup, you would lose the details of 70 customers 
and their orders. In most businesses, this would be quite a dire situation.
Now when you first open your PrestaShop site, you might not get an order for some 
weeks. So does this mean an infrequent backup would be okay? Maybe yes. But when your 
PrestaShop site is new, you are probably going to be making more regular configuration 
changes. Some or all of these could be lost if you don't have a recent backup.
Only you can answer the question of how often to do a complete backup. This will obviously 
depend upon the frequency of change to your PrestaShop files and database. I will show you 
how to take a backup that is fast and trouble-free, although there isn't really any reason not 
to do it daily. Obviously though, it is up to you.
Backing up your database
PrestaShop has a handy database backup utility. This makes backing up your store a breeze. 
Here's how to do it.
Time for action – backing up your database
Log in to your PrestaShop control panel and read on.
1.	 Hover over the Advanced Parameters tab and click on DB Backup.
2.	 Read the disclaimer and click on I have read the disclaimer - Create a new Backup. 
Wow, that was quick! We are almost done.

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 134 ]
3.	 Now click on the link that says Download the Backup file, and save the file to your 
hard disk. If the files on your web host are destroyed, your PrestaShop database 
takes the backup; unless you have downloaded the backup, it is destroyed with 
them. Always download each backup file after creation.
4.	 Click on Back to list and you will notice that PrestaShop keeps a nicely ordered list 
of the database backups you have made. Just be aware of the fact that PrestaShop 
doesn't keep a record of whether you have actually downloaded the backup file. So 
the previous step is really crucial.
What just happened?
You now have a backup of your PrestaShop database. It shouldn't have taken more than a 
minute. We will look at how to use your database backup soon.
Backing up your files
You probably already know how to do this, but as it is so crucial, we will go through it step  
by step.
Time for action – backing up your files
We are going to use FTP, so have your web host's FTP username and password handy, and 
then read on.
1.	 Open an FTP window on your web space containing the PrestaShop files.
2.	 Open a second Explorer window in a folder where you want to keep your backup 
files. You can use a dedicated FTP application as mentioned before.
3.	 Highlight all the files on the web server and drag them to the Backup folder. It might 
take some time for the download to finish; obviously, you don't need to be there to 
watch it happen.
4.	 Sometimes, the download fails. It is very difficult to ascertain exactly at what point 
to resume the download; the safest policy when this happens is to start the whole 
download again. If the download fails on a regular basis, get into the habit of 
copying the folders one at a time. This does demand much more of your attention, 
but you can easily do something else between managing folders.
5.	 To be absolutely sure that your backup is safe, copy it to a CD, DVD, memory stick, 
external hard drive; wherever you like.

Chapter 6
[ 135 ]
What just happened?
You now have a complete, usable backup. With the one caveat of your FTP download 
probably failing, there is only a very tiny demand on your time even if you do this daily.
Now let's look at how to use your backup in the event of disaster.
Using your copy
Using your backup is not too tricky, and because of the importance of the topic, we will go 
through it a step at a time.
Restoring the database
To do this, we will need to get a little bit more technical than when we took a backup of your 
database. We will need to use a database tool called PHPMyAdmin, provided by our web hosts .
Many web hosts provide access to databases hosted with them through PHPMyAdmin; in 
the unlikely event that your web host doesn't, contact technical support and ask them for 
the equivalent of this tool. It should then be fairly simple to interpret the instructions given 
in the next Time for action section.
As every web host is different, I will mention shortcuts and some potential problems 
(along with their solutions) that are web host-dependent. What is fairly sure is that at 
some point you will need access to a web-based program provided by your web hosts, like 
PHPMyAdmin. Hence, we will look at that first.
Time for action – how to restore the database
Log in to your web host's control panel. Find PHPMyAdmin. Among all of the hosts that 
are in use, it can be accessed by viewing the list of databases and then clicking on Edit or 
Manage with PHPMyAdmin. Then a screen very similar to the next screenshot is shown by 
clicking on the edit link next to the PrestaShop database. All the functions that we carry out 
in this tutorial will be performed on that specific database.
When you have located PHPMyAdmin or your web host's equivalent, read on.
1.	 Open a new browser window or tab. In your web host's control panel, delete  
the database.
2.	 Recreate the database using the same name, username, and password. A potential 
problem here is that some web hosts do not let you choose the name of a database. 
Don't panic, just create a new database and proceed with whatever name they  
give you. An extra step that I point out near the end of this tutorial should solve  
the problem.

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 136 ]
3.	 Extract the compressed database backup on your hard disk so that you are left with 
a file named something.sql.
4.	 Go to your PHPMyAdmin control panel and click on Databases, and you will see the 
screen change to display a row of tabs across the top. They look like the ones in the 
following screenshot:
5.	 Click on the database for which you would like to import your backup, and click on 
the Import tab after that. Browse to your extracted database backup and select the 
file. You will also need to click on the Go button on the PHPMyAdmin page. A few 
seconds later, your database will be restored.
6.	 If you created a database with the same username and password, you can skip the 
rest of this tutorial. If not, you have a bit more to do.
7.	 Among your backup files, you need to open a file from the config folder using 
Notepad. The file is named settings.inc.php.
8.	 There, you will see a list of database configuration parameters. Simply copy and 
paste your new database name, server address, username and password to 
overwrite the old ones. Save the file and read on.
What just happened?
You now have a perfectly restored database.
Restoring the files
This is much simpler and quicker than restoring the database. Simply put, we need to replace 
all the files on the web server with the files from our backup.
Time for action – restoring your files
1.	 Open an FTP connection to your web server.
2.	 Delete all the PrestaShop files on your web server.

Chapter 6
[ 137 ]
3.	 Upload all the backup files. Be sure to upload them in the exact same structure in 
which they existed previously. For example, if you stored the backup files in a folder, 
don't upload the folder they were stored in as well.
4.	 As with backing up your files, if you get errors when dragging all the files and folders 
at once, retry doing the process using a folder or two at a time. Don't forget the 
"loose" files that reside in the main directory and not in any of the PrestaShop 
folders.
5.	 Visit your shop front and the PrestaShop control panel to see if they are working.
6.	 Breathe a sigh of relief.
What just happened?
You have just deployed a backup of your store.
Assessing what went wrong
The first thing to do is check whether you have the latest version of PrestaShop installed. 
Upgrading is covered in a minute. Other than that, the causes of a hack attack can be difficult 
to assess. Take a look at the upcoming Have a go hero section to learn and think about some 
extra precautions to prevent the recurrence of such an attack.
Have a go hero – securing your newly restored shop
So what if the security problem arose because the hacker had your database username, 
address, or your admin password? How can you stop exactly the same thing from happening 
tomorrow? You can find the answer to these questions by following the steps given here:
1.	 Create a new database with a different name, username, and password through 
your web host's control panel.
2.	 Import the backup file for the new database just as you did for the original. Then 
in your PrestaShop folder, you need to open a file from the config folder using 
Notepad. The file is named settings.inc.php.control.
3.	 Now enter the details of your new database. Be sure to get them exactly the same. 
Click on Save. Your hacker must again start discovering the details of your database.
4.	 Now click on the Employees tab, click on the Edit icon and type in a new password. 
Click on Save.
5.	 If the hacker used your password, he now needs to start again.

Upgrading PrestaShop
PrestaShop will add new features and enhancements from time to time. Of course, it is great 
to be able to add these improvements to your shop.
The main reason to keep your shop up-to-date at all times is because the updates include 
security fixes, that is, changes to PrestaShop that make it less likely and harder for a 
malicious person to mess up your hard work or compromise your customer's security.
Time for action – how to upgrade PrestaShop
Keeping PrestaShop up-to-date will keep us secure against all the known threats. So let's do it.
1.	 Make sure you have a full backup of your store, files, and database in case this goes 
horribly wrong. And it can.
2.	 Log in to your PrestaShop control panel. If there is an update available, it will be 
shown near the top of your admin login page. If not, you could revisit this tutorial 
when there is one.
3.	 Click on the Download link and save the upgrade. Yours will probably have a 
different version number from the one in the screenshot.
4.	 Extract the download and you will be left with a prestashop folder full of 
subfolders and files.
5.	 Rename your main prestashop folder and leave it on your website. Call it 
prestashop_old. We are doing this so that in a few steps time, we would easily 
be able to copy back some files to the new folder. You can perform this step in your 
web host's control panel or by opening an FTP window, right-clicking the folder and 
selecting Rename, and then renaming it to prestashop_old.
6.	 Now recreate an empty folder with the same name as your original prestashop 
folder (the one you just renamed).
7.	 Upload all the files and folders within the upgrade folder to the folder where 
PrestaShop was located originally. You now have the latest versions of the 
PrestaShop files on your server. But what about all your configurations?
8.	 Copy the /img directory from your old folder to the folder with the upgraded files.
9.	 Copy the /modules directory from your old folder to the folder with the  
upgraded files.

Chapter 6
[ 139 ]
10.	 If you have installed any new themes, copy the /themes/newtheme directory from 
your old folder to the folder with the upgraded files.
11.	 Compare the contents of the old and new .htaccess files in the main directory. 
Add any parts in the old file that are not present in the new file, to the new file. 
Don't simply copy them across folders because the upgrade might include some 
amendments. Simply copying the files across would remove these changes.
12.	 Copy your sitemap.xml file from the old files to the new ones.
13.	 Copy the config/settings.inc.php file from the old folder to the new one.
14.	 Run the installer and do things just as before, but select update on the first 
page. PrestaShop knows you are performing updates due to the presence of the 
settings.inc.php file. When you're ready, type in www.yourshop.com/
install.
15.	 On the next page of the update wizard, you will see a warning. If you followed this 
guide, you have already done so. Click on the I certify button, and then click on the 
Next button.
16.	 When you're done, just as before, delete the install folder and rename the 
admin folder.
If you think that this is very complicated, PrestaShop now has a module to do an auto 
upgrade. The module's name is 1-click Upgrade. You still need to remember to do a backup, 
because this module is experimental; my experience with it has been 99% positive.
Sometimes, when you do a major upgrade from Version 1.x to 1.y, you need to rewrite the 
theme. Again, please do a backup before you do this.
What just happened?
You now have the latest version of PrestaShop up and running.
Okay, I admit it. That wasn't pretty. Upgrading PrestaShop is a little bit of a chore. This is one 
of the few areas where other shopping carts do a little better. But it's not so bad either. Half 
an hour's work every couple of months to get the latest features and security fixes shouldn't 
really be a huge problem.
Have a look at this quick challenge that is related to upgrading PrestaShop.
Have a go hero – keeping your store live while upgrading
While all the various processes are going on, during an upgrade, your shop is offline. When 
brand new, this is probably not a problem. But what about in a year or two when you are 
serving hundreds of customers at a time? Being offline is obviously unacceptable!

Security and Disaster Recovery
[ 140 ]
How would you perform the upgrade without affecting your stores availability? (A clue is that 
it involves temporarily having two sets of working files using the same database.)
The answer is, simply perform the upgrade in a new folder; you could call it prestashop_
new. Now you can copy across your settings as before but, this time, from a live folder. When 
you run the installer, don't forget to type in www.yourshop.com/prestashop_new/
install. When you have finished, rename the original folder to prestashop_old and 
rename prestashop_new to the name of your original PrestaShop folder (pointed to by 
your domain name).
This chapter in a nutshell
There is lots you can do to protect your PrestaShop site. But there is always a way in which 
a determined attacker can find a flaw with your security. Do everything you can; in fact, I 
suggest you read up further on general web security. A good starting point is an excellent 
article I found via the PrestaShop forums. Here it is:
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/14/web-security-primer-are-
you-part-of-the-problem/
But remember, you are never totally secure. Always have a very recent backup that is ready 
for use.
Summary
We have learned a lot in this chapter about malicious attacks, user-caused problems, how to 
avoid them, and how to recover from them when all else fails.
Specifically, we covered the following topics:


The most common types of malicious attacks and some problems that can be caused 
by legitimate users


User security using groups and permissions


SSL for our customers and our own privacy


Keeping PrestaShop up-to-date and safe from known attacks by upgrading 
PrestaShop to the latest version


Creating and using a backup
Now that we have this essential information under our belts, it is time to look at how we 
actually get money from our customers and the different ways in which this can be achieved 
with PrestaShop payment modules.

Checkouts and Shipping
In this chapter we will configure and set up anything and everything related 
to receiving payments. This will include the actual mechanism for getting 
customers' money from their account to yours, as well as a number of other 
important related topics.
In this chapter, we shall:


Choose and set up a payment provider


Look at alternative payment methods

Handling payments
There are a number of interrelated issues with regard to payment handling, some of which are 
not obviously apparent. This is one of those times where I recommend to read about payment 
providers and currencies, to completely understand the best option that fits your business.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 142 ]
Which payment provider should I use?
This is an interesting question. The three big players that we will cover specifically are Google 
Checkout, PayPal and Amazon payments. There are a few comparisons between them that 
should help you choose the best option for you. First, a few words about merchant accounts.
Merchant accounts
A merchant account is where you use a company, sometimes called a "gateway", to handle 
the actual transaction, but the customer's payment is deposited directly into your account. 
This sounds great and in some ways it is, but it's not always a good option. Another 
advantage is that you are probably less prone to being defrauded by a customer. This is 
because regular credit card chargeback rules apply. Although they are there to protect the 
consumer and not you, they are not as easily abused as they are through Google Checkout, 
and especially PayPal.
The big downside with having your own merchant account is cost. Rates vary and many 
gateways and banks have low introductory offers, which make it difficult to accurately 
calculate the real ongoing cost. But here is a typical example of costs after special offer 
periods for a typical UK business. You would need to pay the monthly charges and 
transaction charges of a business bank account, the monthly charges and the setup charges 
required by the bank for the merchant account, and the monthly and transaction charges of 
the gateway company. A quick calculation using a main UK bank and a well-known gateway 
company came to over a hundred UK pounds per month and several hundred pounds setting 
them up.
The other downside is that the technical requirements—how they interact with 
PrestaShop—of the various gateways are different and there is not always a handy module to 
do the job. So programming knowledge or getting your wallet out is often required.
So why would anyone use a merchant account? I already mentioned the payments are directed 
to your account, but the percentage charge per transaction is also usually significantly low. 
But, of course, you have to consider the monthly costs even before you have to take a single 
payment. This means merchant accounts don't usually add up for a new business.
If you are expecting a very high turnover very quickly and you want the slightly more retailer-
friendly chargeback conditions, then get your wallet out and get a merchant account.
PayPal, Google Checkout, bank wire, or cash on delivery?
PayPal and Google Checkout allow you to sign up and get trading with a few free clicks. Both 
companies have a PrestaShop module, which makes setting up your checkout almost as easy 
as adding any other module. There are some differences that will probably sway you in one 
direction or the other.

Chapter 7
[ 143 ]
If you do not trust third parties then you can always use a Bank wire or Cash on delivery, but 
with those options the process will be slower. Anyway PrestaShop has a module if you want 
to offer this to your customers.
SSL requirements
To use Google Checkout, you must use SSL. Google will not handle payments and 
communicate with PrestaShop without it. Shared SSL is fine, but that (as we spoke about in 
Chapter 6, Security and Disaster Recovery) does involve some technical jiggery-pokery. So 
a small monthly investment to buy a dedicated SSL Certificate might be necessary. PayPal, 
Bank wire or Cash on delivery does not require you to have an SSL Certificate.
Cost
At the time of writing this book, Google Checkout was slightly cheaper than it is now. Both 
the cost per transaction and the percentage of sale value charges were slightly lower. So your 
handling costs with Google Checkout were lower.
Getting your money
Google Checkout can pay you monthly or daily, as per your choice. This might sound quite 
good because you obviously want your money as quickly as possible. But I found out that 
monthly was a bit too infrequent and daily was awkward for accounting purposes. Leaving 
my customers' money for a whole month was awkward for maintaining cash flow and daily 
squirts of varying amounts of money was a major pain.
PayPal allows you to decide when to withdraw your money. So you can wait till the end of 
the month if you are not selling much because you are just getting started or do it weekly or 
more frequently, whichever is the best for you. PayPal does charge for withdrawals under 
£50, and, as you might expect, it takes a few days after the request to receive your funds.
Flexibility
Google Checkout and PayPal can take payments from almost anywhere in the world. 
However, Google Checkout can only take the payment in your country's native currency.  
This means that a customer from the US could buy something from a store in France but  
will have to pay in Euros only.
PayPal can take payment in most major currencies, which can make your customer feel 
more comfortable about a purchase and will perhaps be more likely to complete it. You can 
specifically configure PayPal to accept other currencies or just tell PrestaShop to accept them 
(more on this later), and when a transaction is made with a new currency, PayPal will take 
the confirmation from you on whether to take it or not.

Chargebacks
Google Checkout and PayPal offer protection to your customers. The precise terms and 
conditions are a bit of a minefield and I am not qualified to go into it in depth, but I can give 
you some feedback based on experience.
Google Checkout has a chargeback process that could be considered comparable to that of 
the major banks. PayPal, on the other hand, is significantly biased towards your customer. If 
a customer contacts PayPal and claims no delivery, PayPal will immediately freeze your funds. 
They will not discuss it first. If a customer complains to PayPal that goods are significantly not 
as described, they will do the same.
It will then be up to you to prove otherwise. You will enter into an electronic arbitration 
system on the PayPal website, and PayPal will decide the outcome. They will not discuss it 
with you. There will be no human contact and their decision is final. The frozen funds could 
be permanently removed from your account.
Go and have a look at www.paypalwarning.com and you'll see thousands of horror stories.
In a nutshell, you need to consider the needs of your business. If you sell the type of 
products that are not repeatedly purchase, are low margin, and prone to fraud, then 
seriously consider Google Checkout. By prone to fraud I mean the sort of goods that are 
easily resold for cash. Consumer electronics are a good example.
However, if you have a high-margin product where you are building a base for loyal 
customers who repeat their purchase, then the convenience and ease of PayPal could still 
be right for you. And of course, PayPal's bias towards the consumer is quite well-known. This 
fact could mean that the since consumers feel protected, they are more likely to shop from 
you and most of them, of course, are honest.
Friendliness
If you get any technical issues with Google Checkout, you have to discuss it via e-mail. With 
PayPal, perhaps surprisingly, you can get technical support via telephone.
However, don't expect PayPal or Google to discuss a dispute with you. They will act in 
whatever way is the best for them and that will be the end of the matter.
Conclusion
If you are wondering which one should I use, then the answer is both. So there is no best 
payment handler, but there will be a payment handler that suits you best.
Decide from the pros and cons and choose what is best for you. Now read on...

Have a go hero – turning a negative into a positive
Please don't let this section put you off PayPal and Google Checkout altogether. After years 
of trading and having set up a dozen shops around, I still haven't moved on to a merchant 
account. PayPal and Google Checkout are too convenient. Just take steps to protect yourself.
Q) If you have a customer who gets a chargeback claiming non-delivery, what can you do?
A) Always get a proof of posting. If an order is not cost-effective to track, get a proof of 
posting. You can often claim it from the delivery service. The very fact that you have 
documentation of a dispute on PayPal is the evidence that a parcel has never arrived.
You can often claim up to an agreed maximum per package for the lost mail. And here is 
the good bit: you can often claim the retail price. So if you resupply the product to your 
customer and avoid a refund, you can actually make more money than if the package had 
got there without getting lost!
Also, by making a claim, the postal service will often investigate. If there is a person making 
regular fraudulent claims, you will add evidence to the case against them. I have received two 
feedbacks in the last few years where legal action has been taken. One action was taken against 
a defrauding "customer" and another was taken against an employee of the delivery service.
Check the specific details of your delivery service. If you don't like it, look for a new one. If 
you can't afford to lose the package, then you need to pay for tracking. If the margin is too 
small to pay for tracking, reconsider your prices or product range.
Using PayPal
What follows is a really brief discussion and tutorial to get your PrestaShop connected to 
PayPal so that you can start taking payments. It is brief because that is all that is necessary.
PayPal account
Visit www.paypal.com and you will be redirected to the PayPal site that is appropriate 
for your country or region. Sign up for an account if you don't already have one and make 
sure to choose the premier account. PayPal will want to verify your credentials with a few 
procedures that might take a few days. So sign up as soon as possible in order to keep off the 
running for passing my 7-day challenge.
Setting up your PayPal checkout
Once you have a Premier PayPal account, you need to configure PrestaShop and your PayPal 
account for them to talk to each other.

Time for action – installing the PayPal module
Here is how to do it: 
1.	 In your PrestaShop control panel, hover on Modules and click on the Payments & 
Gateways option. Then install the PayPal (Addons) module.
2.	 Now click on Configure next to the PayPal module you just installed. Here is a 
screenshot of what you will see:
 
3.	 PayPal business e-mail simply refers to the e-mail address used on your PayPal 
account. So put that in there.
4.	 Select No for Sandbox mode. We want to do this for real.

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
5.	 Go to the main profile page by clicking on the Profile tab. Under the Selling 
preferences column, click on Website Payment Preferences. Make sure Auto Return 
and Payment Data Transfer are set to Off. These settings are turned off because 
PrestaShop communicates directly with PayPal to configure these options. Do not be 
concerned if you think these settings should be on.
What just happened?
You told PrestaShop to use PayPal. You then gave it the payment e-mail required by PayPal. 
Then we clicked a few boxes on the PayPal website to make sure all is well. PrestaShop does 
the rest for you. How nice!
Using Google Checkout
Here is how to do it. There is a little bit more to it than PayPal, but not much. The slightly 
lower fees should make the tiny bit of extra work worthwhile. Make sure you have SSL set up 
on your store before continuing.
Go to the Google site for your country or region. Click on Business solutions and then 
Checkout and sign up for a Google Checkout account if you do not already have one at 
https://checkout.google.com.
Installing the checkout
Is your Google Checkout account open in a tab on your browser and your PrestaShop control 
panel in another? If it is that then we will be clicking back and forth between the two.
Time for action – how to set up Google Checkout payments
The first thing to mention is that Google offers a "sandbox mode". This is where you can 
connect to Google Checkout and try everything out but in a mode where no actual financial 
transactions take place. This is quite handy. As our objective is to get up and running quickly, 
we will talk about setting up the real mode. If you want to use the sandbox mode first, the 
instructions are identical. You would just enter the details of your sandbox account instead of 
your real account. You can get a free sandbox account from https://sandbox.google.
com/checkout.

There is nothing particularly technical here, but there are a number of steps that need to be 
done just right. So let's do this:
1.	 Hover on Modules and click on the Payments & Gateways on the left-hand side of 
the bar. Install the gcheckout (Addons), and click on Configure.
2.	 Set the Mode to Real.
3.	 On your Google Checkout account home page, in the top right corner is your 
Merchant ID. Copy and paste this into the Merchant ID field.
4.	 On your Google Checkout account, click on the Settings tab. Then, from the list on 
the left, click on Integration. On the right-hand side, you will see your Merchant 
Key. Copy and paste this into the Merchant Key field on the PrestaShop Google 
Checkout module configuration page.
5.	 Disable logging by unchecking in the Logs checkbox. Logging is beyond the scope of 
this book, and without additional action, it might present a security issue.
6.	 In the information box, at the bottom of the PrestaShop Google Checkout module 
configuration page, there is a URL in bold. This is your API callback URL. This is where 
Google Checkout communicates with your PrestaShop to talk about orders and 
payments. Copy this URL in full, including the http right from the end.

Chapter 7
[ 149 ]
7.	 In your Google Checkout account, on the Integration page, paste this URL into the 
box labeled API callback URL.
8.	 Just below this box, check the Notification as XML option. This denotes the protocol 
that PrestaShop and Google Checkout will use to communicate.
9.	 Save the settings in your Google Checkout account and your PrestaShop Google 
Checkout module configuration page.
What just happened?
Google Checkout and PrestaShop will now talk to each other. When a customer wants to 
place an order, PrestaShop will hand the last part of the process to Google Checkout who 
will take the money. Google Checkout will update your Customers and Orders tabs with the 
order details and all relevant information about the transaction.
While you are logged into Google Checkout, you might like to click on the Financials link on 
the left. Check whether your bank account details are correct and choose the frequency of 
payments from Google Checkout to your bank account.
Cheque
From experience, this is probably the most common form of payment after a conventional 
online payment. There are a number of reasons a customer might want to pay by cheque. As 
an example, there are still millions of people who love the idea of the Internet to browse and 
research but wouldn't use their credit card online unless they could travel up the telephone 
wire with it to keep it safe.
Cheque is a good solution. Enable the cheque module in the usual place, click on Configure, 
and you can specify whom to make cheques payable to and where to send them. PrestaShop 
will communicate this information to customers wanting to use cheque as payment.
Most of my cheque orders are from customers a bit like I have described above. I have also 
received orders from companies where they like to be invoiced and then pay by cheque. This 
is a bit of a manual thing to handle but has brought the biggest, most profitable orders that 
any of my shops have had. It can be well worth it. You decide what is best for your business. 
Remember, you can change your mind with the click of a button.
Cash on delivery
The cash on delivery module doesn't really do anything other than make the option available 
during checkout. You would obviously need to use a carrier that can handle cash on delivery. 
There are lots of potential offline security problems here but worth considering for special 
cases like if you are going to sell pizzas.

[ 150 ]
Bank wire
This is where the customer makes a payment directly from their account to yours.
Click on the Payments & Gateways option on the left-hand side bar and then install the Bank 
Wire module. Notice that a fairly non-specific description of what is required is provided. 
This is because banks in different countries require different types of information to receive 
payments. And some banks within the same country sometimes have different requirements.
Contact your bank and find out what is required for somebody to send a payment directly to 
your bank account. Don't be fooled into thinking an account number and branch number (sort 
code) are sufficient. Very often you will need to provide BIC, SWIFT, or IBAN numbers as well.
And don't forget to check whether the payment has arrived before sending the order. So 
you see how this payment method could quickly become awkward or confusing to operate. 
I would suggest using it in special cases. Perhaps you could use this method for a really good 
customer who insists upon this type of payment, for a really good order, or as an occasional 
favor to someone who requests it.
Sales taxes
Depending upon the country, state, or region you operate from and your type and volume 
of business, you will have different taxes. Also, different products have varying tax rates 
and exclusions as well. I hope you think it is reasonable for me to shrug responsibility for 
explaining what your tax rate(s) is.
PrestaShop has made it really easy to apply the appropriate tax rate regardless of the 
country, state, or region, if at all you have to apply tax. Find out your appropriate rate and 
look at this quick tutorial to set the rate in your PrestaShop.
Time for action – setting up PrestaShop to handle sales tax
Here we go:
1.	 Hover on Localization and click on the Taxes subtab.
2.	 Click on Add new; enter the name and rate of tax.
3.	 Click on the boxes where the tax is applicable and Save your new tax.
4.	 Take a look at the screenshot below:

Chapter 7

5.	 Click on the bin icon to delete any taxes that are not appropriate to you.
6.	 Finally, make sure the Enable tax box is ticked. Click on Save.
What just happened?
It is really important to get this right. It is hard to run a business from jail. But that doesn't 
necessarily mean you have to get your wallet out. Most tax authorities offer free advice over 
the phone and face-to-face. Look for them and give them a call.
Now we can go on to explore checkout.
One page checkout
If you want to offer to your customer a very quick payment method, then instead of having 
the default five steps, you should change it to one page checkout.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 152 ]
In one page checkout, you will have all the important things that you need to get from your 
customer in order to get paid only in one page.
This is a new function that is localized in the Preferences tab under the General subtab in the 
Order process type drop-down list.
Guest checkout
It is interesting to have all your customers register on your shop but some might be a little 
reluctant to register on a new web. For this reason you may want to give to your customer 
another way to buy from your shop without any required registration.
To activate this option, you will need to hover on Preferences and click on General. Select 
Yes for the Enable guest checkout option and click on Save. Now it is not mandatory to 
be a registered member to buy from your store. Remember do everything keeping your 
customers in mind, because without them your store has no value.
Currencies
Do you want to encourage customers from other countries to shop from your store? You 
could produce a foreign language version of your website to do this. This was covered in 
Chapter 4, Getting More Customers. A really quick and easy way to encourage purchases 
from countries other than your own is to offer products in foreign currencies.
There are three quick stages in doing this. First, we will add the currencies you want to use.
Adding a currency
If you want to use Euros, US dollars, or GB pounds, then PrestaShop is already set up to do 
this. You can skip this tutorial and read about setting currency rates.
If the currency you want to use is not one of these, then read on.
Time for action – adding a currency
Here is how to add a new currency to your PrestaShop:
1.	 Hover on Localization and click on Currencies.

Setting currency rates
You can Google currency exchange rates or look out for them on all the major news websites. 
Get the exchange rates for all the currencies you wish to accept and read this quick tutorial.
Time for action – setting a currency rate
Here we go:
1.	 Hover on Localization and then click on the Currencies subtab. Quickly make sure 
that the default currency is set correctly because all the rates we set will be used in 
the calculations against your default currency.
2.	 Click on Update currency rates.
3.	 All the conversion rates will be automatically updated by your default currency. 
Please use it with caution, and according the rates are provided in the market at  
the moment.
What just happened?
Of course, the exchange rate is changing all the time. It is perfectly acceptable to set the 
rate a little higher and then just check it occasionally. We will look at auto configuring the 
conversion rate next. This might or might not be for you.

Chapter 7
[ 155 ]
Auto exchange rate updates
Go to Localization | Currencies. On this page there is a button to update the currencies 
rates. So why didn't I tell you about this 10 minutes ago, well you might ask.
Quite simply because:


There is a possibility that you may want to increase the conversion rate of some or 
all of the currencies, in such cases, it is not self-configurable


If the ISO is wrong, it won't work


It can be just plain wrong


Sometimes it doesn't work at all
But with these points in mind, it can be a time-saving tool. But my tip is to first check the 
currency rates at www.xe.com, because you can lose money if the currency rate is too low. 
I can auto-update occasionally with the green button Update currency rates, and then, if 
required, I can also manually raise the rate a little.
Now we can go on to explore or discuss another key aspect of the topic.
Vouchers
Vouchers are good for a lots of things. You can sometimes give them as a refund when the 
customer does not qualify for a money refund. You can keep the customer's goodwill and 
their money. You can distribute or advertise them to encourage sales. I like to offer them as 
an incentive to sign up for my newsletter.
There are no ends of imaginative ways you can use gift vouchers. So let's learn how to create 
and distribute them now. In the next chapter, we will use gift vouchers as part of a broader 
campaign to launch your store and beat my 7-day challenge of opening your store and 
getting your first sale within seven days.
Creating a voucher
First of all, we need to define the parameters of our voucher—when it can be used, who can 
use it, how much, and a bit more as well.

Time for action – creating a voucher

Code
This is the code that must be entered at the checkout by the customer in 
order to get the discount.
It is worth giving meaningful names to your vouchers so that you can 
track their usage and success using PrestaShop statistics features.
But not too long because that makes it awkward for your customers to 
use.
Perhaps JAN20% or AMMO5%. You get the idea.
PrestaShop can also auto generate a random code if you like.

number will be the valid one.
Status

customer but if you want to restrict the voucher to several customers, 
you will need to add their e-mail here.

What just happened?
Now that you have a voucher, people can enter the voucher code during the checkout 
process and get the discount you specified. PrestaShop makes sure all your specifications, 
such as valid dates and quantity per user, are adhered to. If you suddenly realize that a 
mistake has been made, you can quickly disable the voucher.
But how does your customer know about the voucher?
Giving the vouchers to your customer
To give a voucher to a customer, all you have to do is give them the code. PrestaShop 
can then take care of the details based on the parameters you defined when creating the 
voucher. But distribution of vouchers goes a little bit deeper.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 158 ]
I like to create a structure of vouchers for different customers to make as many purchases 
as possible. Consider running a number of voucher promotions simultaneously. I will give 
you an example of a voucher structure in a moment, but obviously you must consider what 
would work and be profitable to your business. Hopefully, my example will give you some 
ideas if not the precise format for a multi-voucher promotion.


5 percent off on everything: A small percentage of amount available to absolutely 
everyone on a one-off basis. Distribute this on relevant forums, social media, your 
home page, and on Google AdWords. There's more in the next chapter about these 
and other promotional ideas.


10 percent off on everything: Consider a bigger, more significant, one-off discount 
for signing up to your newsletter. It is often okay to give away a bit more of your 
profit in return for constant contact with your customer. Remember the value of 
e-mail marketing when you do it right. You could get multiple sales without any 
discount if your customer signs up for and enjoys your newsletters.


Free shipping when you spend: Consider offering free shipping, perhaps 
permanently, in return for larger-than-average orders. Look at or estimate your 
customers' average spend per order. Then consider a value at which to offer free 
shipping that encourages customers to put an extra item or three in their basket. 
Remember to have lots of great add-on and accessory options. You can advertise 
this anywhere and everywhere.


10 percent off category X: Always keep promoting something for customers who 
don't qualify or have already used other vouchers. A discount on a specific category 
will encourage customers to make additional purchases at the same time as non-
discounted ones.
Whatever you decide is best for your shop—take your time to do the math. There is no point 
selling anything if you don't make what you need.
Shipping options
Shipping is a surprisingly wide and deep topic. When I opened my first e-commerce store, 
I was very surprised at the complexity involved in adding a shipping charge to an order. 
So here are a couple of ways you might be able to avoid any complexity-not to save us a 
few minutes or hours configuring your shipping options because if your specific business 
situation demands it, then that is what you obviously have to do. But if even we are baffled 
by the vast array of shipping configurations, then what will our customers think? Will it lose 
us some customers?
In the vast majority (but not all of my stores), I use one of the two following super-simple 
shipping configurations. If one of these work for you, then I recommend using it. If not, what 
follows from my super-simple shipping configurations are a summary of the PrestaShop 
shipping configuration options.

Chapter 7
[ 159 ]
Super-simple shipping configuration options
Is it possible to build the cost of shipping within your product range specifically? I have heard 
arguments against this because it can make the product look more expensive without close 
examination. My view is that customers are not stupid. As long as you make it plain and 
shout about the fact that shipping is included in all your prices, then customers will actually 
appreciate the upfront cost. It can even be a really great feature of your store. 90 percent of 
my stores are all products and free delivery on all products.


To configure free shipping in PrestaShop, click on the Shipping tab and change all 
the figures you see in the following screenshot to zero and save it:


Another option is to configure PrestaShop for free shipping as earlier, and then 
consider adding a flat postage rate for any product. This can be done through the 
same mechanism shown previously by changing the handling charges to whatever 
you want your flat fee to be and then changing Free shipping starts at to 0. So if you 
don't want to load the shipping cost onto the product but want to keep things super 
simple, you can add a flat fee onto every purchase.
Common shipping scenarios
The PrestaShop shipping configuration options does a good job of removing some of the 
complexity of shipping configuration. However, necessarily it is still very in-depth and it could 
easily take up a couple of chapters on its own.
My objective here is to show you exactly how to configure a couple of common scenarios. So 
if you like, skip ahead and follow the tutorial that is most appropriate for you. If, on the other 
hand, you want a deep and full explanation before you decide, then read all the different 
options because, in the last section on configuring shipping, Shipping configuration in depth, 
I will give you some good ideas on how to do almost anything you like.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 160 ]
If you are looking to set up a shop that sells products of varied values and weights to 
different geographic locations and want to vary the shipping cost according to all of these 
factors, then read the three specific scenarios as an introduction and then study the Shipping 
configuration in depth section, including the Bikes4u case study.
As promised, let's start with some relatively simple and common scenarios.
Shipping calculated by sale value
This method gives you the flexibility to define the price range. The ranges can be as narrow 
or as wide as you like. You can then, with a few clicks, assign a shipping price to each range. 
PrestaShop will then charge customers for shipping according to the total value of their order.
Time for action – configuring shipping by sale value
This is how to do it:
1.	 Click on the Shipping tab. Put zero in the handling charge box unless of course you 
want a handling charge on top of the delivery charge. Clear the box labeled Free 
shipping starts at for the weight (kg) because we are not interested in weight at 
this stage. Finally, put a value if you want free shipping to start at, if any, in the box 
labeled Free shipping starts at for the price (€).
2.	 Now we will define some price ranges. Click on the Price Ranges subtab and then on 
Add new.
3.	 Type in the starting value of your first order value price range. Almost certainly the 
From price will be 0. Enter the upper limit of the first range. So if you wanted to 
charge a specific amount of shipping for orders from 0.01 to 49.99, enter the value 
50.00. Click on Save.

Chapter 7
[ 161 ]
4.	 Now click on Add new again. Enter the starting value of your range in the From box. 
This should be the same as the To value from the previous range. This is because the 
actual value you enter in the From field is inclusive, but the value you enter in the To 
field is not inclusive. So if you define the second range as From: 50 and To: 100 then 
the following will apply. All orders up to 49.99 will be in price range one and all orders 
from 50.00 to 99.99 will be in price range two. Click on Save when you're done.
5.	 Define as many ranges as you need. On the last range make the To figure higher 
than you expect an order to ever be. This is the way you will have to define a range 
for any potential order. If, in the Step 1, you added a value, where you offer a free 
shipping, then your highest orders should have that free shipping range.
6.	 Now that we have created some ranges, we will now assign a shipping cost to  
each range.
7.	 Click on the Shipping tab and scroll to the bottom of the page. You can view a 
summary of the ranges you just made. In my following example, I used three ranges: 
$0 to $50, $50 to $100, and $100 to 250$.
8.	 Simply enter the delivery price of each order value range and click on Save.
9.	 Go and put a few things in your basket and see how it works.
What just happened?
You have now defined your shipping costs based on the value of the customer's order. You 
can define the ranges as widely or as narrowly as you like.
Configuring shipping by weight
This method gives you the flexibility to define ranges of weight. The ranges can be as narrow 
or as wide as you like. You can then, with a few clicks, assign a shipping price to each range 
of order weight. PrestaShop will then charge customers for shipping according to the total 
weight of their order.
Time for action – how to configure shipping by weight
The first thing to do is to tell PrestaShop the weight of each of your products so that it can 
sum it up together. So let's get on with it:
1.	 During the setup of your products, we discussed the weight property in the product 
configuration page. If you didn't define the weight then but now if you have decided 
to calculate shipping by weight, then click back into your products and configure the 
weight before continuing.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 162 ]
2.	 Click on the Shipping tab. Put zero in the handling charge box unless of course you 
want a handling charge on top of the delivery charge. Clear the box labeled Free 
shipping starts at for the price because we are not interested in order price in this 
tutorial. Finally, put a weight you want free shipping to start at, if any, in the box 
labeled Free shipping starts at for the weight.
3.	 Now we will define some weight ranges. Click on the Weight ranges subtab and then 
on Add new.
4.	 Type in the starting value of your first order weight range. Almost certainly the value 
of From weight will be 0. Enter the upper limit of the first range. So if you wanted 
to charge a specific amount of shipping for orders from 0.01 kg to 4.99 kg, enter the 
value 5.00. Click on Save.
5.	 Now click on Add new again. Enter the starting value of your range in the From box. 
This should be the same as the To value from the previous range. This is because the 
actual value you enter in the From field is inclusive but the value you enter in the To 
field is not inclusive. So if you define the second range as From: 5 and To: 10, then 
the following will apply. All orders weighing up to 4.99 kg will be in price range one 
and all orders from 5.00 up to 9.99 will be in price range two. Click on Save when 
you're done.
6.	 Define as many ranges as you need to. On the last range, make the To figure higher 
than you expect an order to ever be. This way you will have defined a range for 
any potential order. However, if, in Step 1, you entered a value where free shipping 
starts, then your highest ranges To value should equal the value at which free 
shipping starts.
7.	 Now that we have created some ranges, we will assign a shipping cost to each range.
8.	 Click on the Shipping tab and scroll to the bottom of the page. Make sure that 
According to total weight is selected. You can then view a summary of the ranges 
you just made.
9.	 Simply enter the delivery price of each weight range and click on Save.
10.	Go and put a few things in your basket and see how it works.
What just happened?
You have defined your shipping costs based on the weight of your customer's order.
Now we can go on to explore the PrestaShop shipping configuration options in more depth.
Shipping configuration in depth
Think about this scenario.
Bikes4u is the web outlet for a major bikes reseller. Bikes4u has a very wide range of bikes, 
from children to professional bikers.

Chapter 7
[ 163 ]
So the need for a more flexible shipping solution is apparent. For example, a private 
customer ordering a mountain bike to be delivered will raise varied different costs depending 
upon the place of delivery.
If you also consider that the products of similar weights could actually cost varied different 
amounts. This is because we need to consider the type and also the manner of their delivery 
needs to be catered. Perhaps a wheel compared to a pedal. Clearly, the latter needs much 
more sophisticated and costly transport.
Can PrestaShop be configured to offer a solution?
Part of the solution lies in offering multiple shipping options. It is possible to have multiple 
carriers and then define each carrier to use a different shipping method.
You can create an extra carrier. Hover on Shipping, then click on Carriers, and then on  
Add new.
Notice the top field in the previous form—Company. This is not necessarily for the actual 
company, it can also be for a description of the service. For example, in the Bikes4u, we could 
create a carrier called "Large parcels". This enables us to make it clear to our customers what 
the carrier is for. We can then define order value or weight ranges specific to this carrier. This 
is achieved after creating our new carrier by defining a weight or order value range in the 
normal way but selecting our new carrier in the drop-down box as we do so.
Notice also in the Add new carrier form that the option to define availability by continent. 
So you could create multiple carriers with different price or weight ranges, perhaps called 
"Small pieces Europe", "Small pieces Africa", and so on.
As you can see things can get complicated. Forget Bikes4u for a moment and consider a large 
online retailer like Amazon. Think about the vast range of weights, order values, product 
types, and destinations, not to mention the choice of different speeds within all these other 
possibilities.
The key to a successful shipping configuration, like that on Amazon, when a very simple 
price, weight, flat fee, or free model will not do, is planning. If you must introduce multiple 
carriers, think carefully about what to call them and how to configure them, because your 
customers, not us, need to understand them in order to spend money.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 164 ]
If it is not necessary to create new carriers in PrestaShop, then don't. Let's suppose we use 
regular mail for order weights up to x and a courier for x and over. Do we need to create 
two carriers in PrestaShop? The answer is that if a single carrier, perhaps "Our carrier", can 
have weight ranges defined that charge what we need to, then don't create a new carrier in 
PrestaShop. A simple explanation of when you use regular mail and when you use a courier 
on your Delivery and Returns page would probably be much better.
The new and important functionality in PrestaShop 1.5 is the fact that you can assign 
different carriers to every single product. This is really a handy feature when dealing with 
different kinds of products.
Gift wrapping and recycled packaging
On top of all these shipping options, there are two more. They can be both money makers 
and credibility builders. If you offer a product suitable to be a gift, why not offer a gift 
wrapping service and charge for it? If you have a product that is available in full packaging or 
a more minimalist, environment-friendly form of packaging, why not offer that too?
Time for action – setting up gift wrapping and recycled 
packaging options
Here is how to do it.
1.	 Hover on the Preferences tab and click on Orders.
2.	 Scroll down to what you can see in the following screenshot.

Chapter 7
[ 165 ]
3.	 Click on Yes or No for gift wrapping.
4.	 Enter a price for the service.
5.	 Enter a tax rate, if any.
6.	 Click on Yes or No to Offer recycled packaging.
What just happened?
By offering gift wrapping and recycled packaging, you can increase your turnover, and please 
your customers. This can all be done at the same time with just a couple of clicks.
Pop quiz – a refresher
Q1. How does SSL make your password safer?
1.	 Because all the banks use this way
2.	 It is the Super Secure Login mode
3.	 Because it is a protocol for encrypting information over the Internet
Q2. How are your customers' credit card details protected when using PayPal, even if you 
don't use SSL?
1.	 PayPal is like a bank, for that the use the Super Secure Login mode
2.	 Because, when the customers use the PayPal payment gateway, they automatically 
jump to the PayPal servers
3.	 That only happens if it is selected in the PayPal properties
Your PrestaShop so far
Phew, this chapter was a big one! But it is worth knowing how advanced and in-depth your 
options are.
Are you starting to get a little bit excited? Your shop is ready. It is connected and configured 
for real customers. Goodbye 9-5, hello e-commerce business.

Checkouts and Shipping
[ 166 ]
Summary
We learned a lot in this chapter about checkouts, currencies, taxes, and shipping.
Specifically, we covered:


How to choose and connect the best payment provider for your business


Some alternate payment methods


How to take multiple currencies and configure sales taxes


How to set up simple and efficient shipping options
Now that we've reached this stage, we will do a few quick checks on your checkout, get some 
family/friends' sales to make your shop look used, and then give the final push to your first 
small wave of real customers. All this and more will be covered in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.

Ready to Sell
This chapter is all about final preparations. It's a quick dry run through the 
process of making a purchase, followed by the first steps in a diverse marketing 
campaign that we will cover more in detail in the next chapter.
In this chapter, we shall:


Create a customer account and place an order


Look at the PrestaShop customer loyalty scheme


Look at how to get some feedback on your products using the PrestaShop Product 
Comments module


Tell the search engines about your cool new shop


Look at a multi-pronged marketing campaign, which includes vouchers and  
social media


Cover some functionality of the Customers and Orders tabs that we haven't  
already covered
So let's get on with it.
Before we look at the first element of the campaign, let's make sure that everything is 
working properly, such as checkouts and shipping, because we will look unprofessional in 
front of our customers if these are not working properly.
First of all, let's get ourselves a customer. Here you will need the goodwill of a friend or 
relative. We are going to ask them to make a purchase. You can obviously refund the 
purchase once the transaction is complete. I am also going to suggest that you lend or give 
away some of your products for them to use. The reasons for this will become clear as we 
proceed through the chapter.

Creating an account and placing an order
You can create an account on behalf of your willing volunteer or you can ask them to  
create it for themselves. The important thing for us here is to pay close attention to the 
details of the sign up process. We are looking to see whether we have missed something. 
Does it look easy and intuitive? If your willing volunteer is doing the form filling, did he or 
she find it straightforward?
Time for action – creating an account and placing an order
Here's how to do it. I will go through this tutorial as if you are doing the clicking.
1.	 Browse through your store and add a couple of products to your cart. Click on  
the cart link and see what it looks like. Does it all look straightforward and intuitive 
to you?
2.	 Click on the Check out button and create an account when you are prompted to  
do so.
3.	 Click on the Next button and review the shipping summary page. Does it appear as 
expected, with the right shipping options? If it does, click on Next.

Chapter 8
[ 169 ]
 
4.	 Select one of the payment options: PayPal, Google Checkout, or any other option 
that you have set up. If you have chosen to offer the cheque, bank wire, or cash on 
delivery payment methods, then I suggest that you do not choose them here. It will 
be useful (as we will see later in the chapter) to see how PrestaShop integrates with 
your chosen payment provider; we will discuss how to handle orders as well.
5.	 Complete the transaction through your preferred payment provider.

What just happened?
Now we know that the whole process is up and working. We understand first hand what our 
customers need to do in order to spend money in our store. We are now much better placed 
to serve them and turn them into long-term, big spenders. We will use this account to do a 
few things in this chapter.
Let's look at a PrestaShop feature to encourage repeat business.
If you need to change/add fields for the customer registration form, we can always edit it in 
our back office.
Repeat business with a customer loyalty scheme
The customer loyalty scheme is great. If you have enough profit margins in your products, 
consider giving a little bit back to your customers in return for some repeat purchases. 
This works especially well if your customers have lots of stores to choose from and you sell 
repeatedly purchased items.
The best way to learn about how the loyalty scheme works is by setting it up.
Time for action – setting up your loyalty scheme
Here's what to do:
1.	 Click on the Modules tab and scroll down to the Customer loyalty and rewards 
scheme. Install this module.
2.	 Click on Configure. You will see something similar to the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
[ 171 ]
3.	 Most of the fields can be left as they are, with their default values. Here is an 
explanation of the interesting or important ones. First, in the Ratio field, enter the 
number of US dollars ($), British pounds sterling (£), or Euros that a customer must 
spend to earn a point.
4.	 Underneath this field, you will have to enter the value of a single point as the 
decimal fraction of your chosen unit of currency. Do the math carefully for this 
value. For example, if you leave in the default values of $10 per point and the value 
at 0.2 per point, then for every $10 your customer spends, they will get 20 cents. If 
this is not generous enough, you can reduce the required spending per point, say, to 
5. Then they would get 20 cents for every $5 spent. Or you can make it your strategy 
to encourage a high average spend and then reward it by being a bit more generous. 
You can make the customer spend $50 per point but then give them a $5 value. 
Think carefully about what will work for you.

[ 172 ]
5.	 Enter what you want the voucher to be called in the Voucher details field. Leave it 
at Loyalty reward, or call it something else such as Fluff points or Thanks 
vouchers. It is arbitrary, leave it as it is or choose something that you like.
6.	 If you need to temporarily stop discounting, just click on the red cross next to Give 
points on discounted products.
7.	 The Points are awarded when the order is field is self-explanatory. The default  
value of Delivered is probably a good option. It means that the discount will 
become available when you mark your customer's order as delivered. But you can 
choose others.
8.	 The Points are cancelled when the order is drop-down field is important because it 
stops customers from accumulating points when they get refunds or cancel an order.
What just happened?
You now know how to offer a loyalty reward scheme.
Getting some product comments
You now have somebody who is using your products, and it is time to ask them what they 
think of these products. You can also ask for feedback on what they think about your store. 
You can ask them to log in to their account and leave some product comments. Alternatively, 
you could create the comments on their behalf.
All about comments
I strongly recommend that you do not invent comments. Such comments are really easy to 
spot and obviously show the lack of integrity. This is not the path we want to start on, right 
at the beginning of our new business. However, filling out some comments on behalf of a 
genuine user of our products is probably fine.
The benefit of this is, you will again get to see how the process works, and just as 
importantly, your future customers will have comments to view. This makes your site look 
more established as well as being useful and reassuring to a customer for the purpose of 
making decisions.
How to get some product comments
Get the feedback of your willing volunteer. Then follow this quick guide.

Chapter 8
[ 173 ]
Time for action – getting some feedback for your products
This is really easy.
1.	 First of all, we need to enable product comments. Of course, if you think product 
comments are not suitable for your store, then you don't have to do this. However, 
the benefits are great so think carefully before skipping this guide. Log in to your 
admin control panel.
2.	 Click on the Modules tab, and install the Product Comments tab. Now click on 
Configure, next to the module you have just installed.
You will see the following screenshot when you click on Configure:

Ready to Sell
[ 174 ]
3.	 Select whether you want to validate comments before publishing them. This option 
is useful if you are nervous about what people might say.
4.	 The next two options for Criterion are optional. For each product, you can create 
a grading criterion. Let me explain. Your customer will be able to choose upto five 
stars. You can suggest and specify a criterion for these stars (for example, Please 
choose 1 star for poor or 5 stars for great). You can then assign specific criteria to 
specific products in the next box. As I said, this step is not necessary; however, if 
you have a product range that would benefit from a specific criterion, then specify it 
here (for example, a site such as Bikes4U.com would use Weight or Quality).
5.	 Click on Save and visit your shop front. Browse to the first product you want to leave 
a comment for. Notice the new tab at the bottom of the screen. Click on it.
6.	 Leave a rating in stars (be honest) and a product comment. Click on Send.
7.	 Now go back to your admin control panel, click on the Modules tab, and then click 
on Configure next to the Product Comments module.

Chapter 8
[ 175 ]
8.	 Notice that you can approve or delete any of the comments. Obviously, it is not 
a good practice to delete a comment just because it is imperfect. However, if the 
comments are unfair, untrue, or abusive, then I would say that you have complete 
liberty to delete them. Approve your comment, and then go back to the products 
page to see the effect on the Comments tab.
9.	 Create and approve as many comments as you can.
What just happened?
You now know the experience your customers will have when writing comments, and you 
also have a good, ethical way to get some comments on your store before real customers 
start shopping.
Now we will look at adding a juicy incentive for all your visitors.
Putting up a discount voucher on the front page
We already know how to make a voucher. Here we will create a voucher for a very specific 
purpose: getting some sales as soon as possible and winning my 7-day challenge.
Creating the voucher (reminder)
Vouchers appear on the Price Rules tab. The things to consider here are the precise values 
for which you will create your vouchers.

Ready to Sell
[ 176 ]
I would suggest a percentage rather than a cash value, because we don't know what sort of 
order values we might get. I would suggest a modest percentage, but one big enough to be 
enticing—maybe 10 percent, if your profit margin can take it.
Set the total quantity quite high. Then the vouchers will continue to be available until  
you disable them. Define a start and an end date for the vouchers—I would suggest  
maybe a month.
I would enter something like Store opening offer for the voucher description and a 
simple, memorable code for the customer to enter during checkout.
Showcasing the voucher
Here I am assuming you have already created your voucher using the guidance provided in 
the previous section or (if necessary) by referring to the content in the previous chapter.
Time for action – putting your voucher on the home page
Do you remember the Home text editor module? We will use it here to showcase your 
opening offer voucher.
1.	 Click on the Modules tab, scroll down to Home text editor, and click on Configure.
2.	 Make sure to put your voucher, as described next, before the fold. That is, when a 
visitor arrives at your home page, they should be able to see it without having to 
scroll through the page.
3.	 I suggest entering a very short introduction to the voucher (probably one 
sentence only, such as Have a look at this great opening offer). Then, below that, I 
recommend using a graphic of a gift voucher. If you're feeling arty, you could create 
one in GIMP. If not, visit www.dreamstime.com and pick up a high quality, enticing 
voucher graphic for around US $1. Below this graphic, in big bold letters, enter the 
voucher code.
4.	 Click on the Update the editor button and visit your home page to check and 
approve of the layout.
What just happened?
Everyone who visits your home page now has a reason to explore further—a discount.
We now have a great shop. We know it works, we have entered comments to make it  
look used, and we have an enticing, special opening offer. It is time to tell the world that  
we are here.

Registering with the search engines
Some of the search engines might have found you already. Certainly, once other sites start 
to link to you, they would find you anyway. However, just to be absolutely sure, we need 
to ensure that we are considered for inclusion with all of the major search engines. We will 
spend a few minutes registering with them.
Registering
Registering with these major search engines will mean you have covered over 95 percent of 
all searches. Spend time registering with the smaller ones later if you like, but at this stage, 
this is more than sufficient.
Time for action – registering with the search engines
We will look at Google first, then Bing and Yahoo!.
1.	 Go to http://www.google.com/addurl/ and fill out the simple form. Also 
consider signing up for Google Webmaster Tools, and explore the options and 
statistics that it provides.
2.	 For Bing, you need to visit http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster; you 
will need a Windows Live ID. If you don't already have one, you can create one  
for free.
3.	 Yahoo! has merged with Bing, so if you did the previous step, this one has been 
done too.
What just happened?
You might get your site indexed immediately, or it might take months. Don't worry too much 
about it because there is no way to influence the search giants other than by creating great, 
unique content. And, of course, we have already done that.
Now let's look at getting your first sale.
Marketing your site
The information in this part of the chapter is designed to be digested in full and used  
fairly simultaneously. If you want to act on each section individually, to dip your toe in, that's 
fine, but my intention is to help you start a campaign that brings you your first wave of 
paying customers.

Ready to Sell
[ 178 ]
It is also important to realize that the brief burst of activity described here is not the end of 
the matter. We will look at some ways in which you can get visitors and links to your site. 
However, be sure to read Chapter 9, Go... to the Future to turn what you do here into an 
ongoing, effective campaign.
Let's get on with it then.
How to write good posts
You do not necessarily have to be an expert in your field, as most forums cater to users of many 
skill levels. However, it is very important to try to pretend that you are an expert even if you are 
not; if you do consider yourself an expert, do not overstate your level of knowledge.
Write at your skill level
You will certainly damage your reputation if you attempt to come across as more of an 
expert than you really are. So if you don't fully understand a topic of conversation, but 
want to join in any way, come clean about your level of knowledge. For example, you could 
start a reply to a post with "I'm no expert but if...". You can give an opinion, even one that 
disagrees with the post but in which you are hinting that you could be wrong. If you're right, 
you will come across as polite, and if you're wrong, you will not be the target of potentially 
embarrassing replies.
Social share buttons
Using social networks is the easiest way in which you can approach your future customers 
because then everyone can share your shop or certain items from your shop on Twitter  
or Facebook.
I recommend Beetailer Widget. You can download it at http://addons.prestashop.
com/en/social-commerce-facebook-prestashop-modules/2928-beetailer-
widget-facebook-plugins-and-twitter-integration.html.
Criticism
People don't like being criticized. If you absolutely must point out that somebody is wrong, 
do so in a very delicate manner.
Don't shamelessly promote yourself
If you sign up for a forum and then post "Hi, come and check out my new bike shop", you will 
be doomed to fail. At the very least, other members will make a mental note of the fact that 
you are a self-promoter and will take what you say with caution. What's even more likely is 
that your post will be removed and you might have your account deleted.

Chapter 8
[ 179 ]
The best way to promote your business is to get involved in conversations about your 
industry, which you should be genuinely interested in. You will gain respect, and you never 
know when the conversation might naturally take a course towards an opportunity to 
mention your shop. Take the opportunity if it arises, but don't keep mentioning it unless the 
conversation makes it completely natural to do so.
If the forum allows it and it is natural to do so (as discussed earlier), include a link to your 
site (if not, your web address would suffice).
The one exception to all of these rules is when the forum has a category specifically intended 
for promoting your business.
So what is the point of all these conversations if you never, or rarely, get the opportunity to 
shout out about your PrestaShop site?
Promoting your store using social media
Social media, at the moment at least, seems to be the big thing on the Web. There are many 
social media sites that allow anybody to join and communicate with millions of members. 
This is obviously an opportunity that is not to be missed. However, it is very easy to end up 
on the wrong path. It is very easy to waste time, and it is also possible to do your business 
more harm than good.
To address these potential pitfalls and to make sure you get the most benefit possible with 
the smallest investment of time, I have created a whirlwind guide to two of the biggest 
social media sites. I aim going to point out the biggest benefits of each and the most likely 
stumbling blocks, as well as some specific methods and actions that work on each platform.
If you want results in as short a time as possible, then read on.
Twitter
Twitter is my favorite because it is so quick and easy. The very nature of Twitter makes it 
really easy for you to build your network. On Twitter, you build a team of "followers". You can 
also be a follower of other Twitter users. If you want significant, fast results, Twitter could be 
for you. However, as with all social media relationships, quality informational content (called 
tweets in this case) is still vital to lasting success. Here are some quick dos and don'ts.
Branding your profile
Make sure that your Twitter page represents your brand and products well, and has your

Following others
It is a good idea to follow some other Twitter profiles. This is the essence of a network on 
Twitter. If you want people to read your information and follow your links in your tweets, then 
you need people to follow you. However, there are many advantages to following others.
For example, you can get really fantastic, really topical information by following people 
interested in and knowledgeable about your industry. In the unlikely event that there is 
nobody on Twitter who fits the bill, you have a massive opportunity to become that person. 
Another advantage of following a respected and popular user is that you can comment on 
their tweets. This, along with the fact that you appear in their list of followers, means that 
more people have a chance of finding you. The holy grail of this type of relationship is when 
the respected user decides to follow you! And when they start replying to your tweets, it will 
bring even more viewers and potential new followers to your Twitter home page.
A lightning guide to tweeting
Every tweet should be meaningful on its own or add something to the conversation. Just 
remember that everything you say is public. If you send a direct message, then even that 
could be repeated publicly. Don't reveal anything private about yourself, and if you want to be 
popular on Twitter, don't spoil anybody else's day by revealing private information about them.
Regular tweets
Just answer the question, "What are you doing now?" Make sure you are tweeting relevant 
industry information: "I am considering a new range of teddy bears for my shop. Do I want 
the giant golden teddy? Or is small best?".
A quick glance at almost any twitterer, and you will see that they tweet a lot more than just 
answering the question, "What are you doing now?". Make up your own questions and 
answer them, for example, "What is the very latest innovation in your industry?" Answer the 
question and, most importantly, give your opinion about it in a single tweet.
It takes some refining of your text, but it can almost always be done. What is the biggest 
upcoming event in your industry and what do you think about it? For example: "Looking 
forward to the teddy bears annual convention this fall—no way am I going to miss it—
anyone else coming?" Asking a question begs for a reply. And as we know, replies are good 
for business. There is no end of topics that can be thought up for even the smallest niche. 
Sometimes the topic could be an ongoing one that could justify many tweets over time. For 
example: "Just looking into how these wonderful Russian teddy bears are manufactured. Did 
you know they start with stuffing made from Siberian wool? "The lining is hand stitched blah 
blah...", and so on. You get the idea. Never lose focus on how to make it relevant for your 
audience. Be consistent, not too frequent, and keep it uncommercial (see the Sales tweets 
section a bit further on).

Chapter 8
[ 181 ]
What's your frequency Kenneth?
What tweeting frequency is right for you will depend upon how frequently things change and 
how dynamic your industry is. Test out different frequencies and look at what popular people 
in your industry are doing. What you can do, quite legitimately, is link to a very closely 
related article on your website. This is perfectly acceptable and would not put off followers. 
Just make sure that the article you link to is entirely relevant and not a product page.
Broadcasting
All your regular tweets should be relevant and personal. So even when talking about an 
event, for example, the focus is on you and how the event relates to you. The exception to 
this rule is when you just want to broadcast something really significant. For example, "Fire 
at Siberian stuffing plant kills three and puts teddy production back by six months".
This is a tweet that people might be interested in, but something that is not personal. And, 
if the timing is right, broadcast tweets will get you lots of attention. But they should not be 
the standard format for your tweets. Being impersonal all the time is uninteresting. Pick your 
broadcast tweets carefully and make sure they are relevant and topical, even more so than 
your regular tweets.
Humor
If you've got it, flaunt it. Jokes are great, and there are plenty of jokes on Twitter. A good joke 
can keep your followers keen. But if you haven't got it, it's probably best to leave the jokes to 
someone else.
Questions
Questions are great. Asking for peoples' opinions often provokes a reply and an appearance 
on someone else's timeline. By all means ask for help, but keep it occasional. The best type 
of question is one that asks for opinions. If you ask for an opinion, you can get responses 
without being socially indebted. Also, if you are lucky (or smart), you might provoke a 
discussion, lots of replies, and the publicity that goes with it. The sorts of questions that you 
can ask are almost limitless. Ask about industry, business, products events, personalities, 
organizations, or anything else relevant. Ask for feedback on a new article, product, or site 
layout. Almost anything is valid.
Achievements and events
Done something great, new, or interesting? Think your followers will care? Then tweet it. 
Attended an industry event, visited a competitor's store/site, had a nice lunch, tweet it all. 
Anything is valid. Just remember that it must be worth reading. So if you regularly tweet 
valid information about your field of expertise, then the occasional, informal nicety is cool 
and a nice contrast. But don't overdo the trivial.

Replying and retweeting
Can't think of anything to say? No problem. Find somebody who can. Search for the  
phrases you are interested in and find something relevant to post a reply to. This will  
tell all your followers what you are looking at. And who knows, the other person's  
tweet might inspire something original from you. And if you're really stuck, just retweet 
(copy) someone's message. Be sure to give credit to the other person. You can do this by 
adding RT @otherpersonstwitterusername to the beginning of the message.
Sales tweets
The simplest and most subtle way of promoting your site is by adding a link to your home 
page with your occasional tweets. The tweet does not have to suggest a purchase or 
promote a product; it should simply say what you want to say and link to your home page so 
that people can click on it and see what you are all about.
A more direct method, but still fairly subtle, is to ask people for an opinion on a very specific 
aspect of a product or service. Ask for feedback on the product itself, or the way in which 
you have described or photographed it. You could ask people for their suggestions on a 
selling price, or just ask "How much would you pay for this teddy?".
You can do this with an existing range or use the same process to get feedback on potential, 
new ranges before you purchase stock. This could generate some useful feedback and even 
some pre-orders.
If you're really stuck, promote your business by offering discount vouchers. Consider this 
very carefully before doing it, because it needs to be financially viable.
Tell your followers about special offers, but be careful. If you're sending out a tweet to a 
group of trusting followers, be absolutely sure that it is genuinely and undeniably special! If 
it isn't, you will lose credibility and probably followers as well. There are loads of people on 
Twitter sending out "special offer" tweets that have links to rubbish, spam, or pornography. 
Don't get tarred with the same brush.
Twitter summary
Build a following by following other quality users, interacting with them, and by sending  
your own quality tweets. You can probably see a trend developing here; it's the same with 
all web content—quality and useful content—don't ram your products (too hard) down 
people's throats.
Also, you can explore your Twitter community at www.socialbro.com.

Facebook
Facebook is more technically endowed than Twitter. The features and fancy gadgets on 
Facebook are far too numerous to go into any greater depth. However, there are a few really 
key places you can market yourself and one really important thing you must never do on 
Facebook.
Avoid spamming
Whenever you post something to your wall or send any other type of message, all of the 
recipients have the option to report it as spam. If too many people do this, your Facebook 
account is likely to get deleted.
So although I do recommend building your network as wide as possible, I don't recommend 
sending commercial messages to your entire group. However, there are a number of 
communication channels where you can get a bit commercial and where you shouldn't get 
reported for spam. In addition, anyone in your social group will be able to see these channels 
when they look at your Facebook profile.
Therefore, by building the biggest network possible but only marketing through very specific, 
targeted channels, you can avoid the spam problem and reach a wider, targeted audience. A 
brief discussion of my top three Facebook features for targeted communication now follows.
Start a group
There is a group for just about everything on Facebook. Have a look at www.facebook.
com/groups. You can use the search by typing in a keyword and looking for a very specific 
group or click on Browse Groups to see the huge range, volume, and diversity of groups. 
Click on Browse Groups and we will explore a little.
Anybody can create a group, and the group could be targeted at anything. When a group is 
created, its creator defines certain criteria. This includes whether the group is open, closed, 
or secret. If a group is open, (you guessed it) you can join it. If it is closed, you will have to 
put in a request to join it; if it is a secret group, you will know nothing about it unless you are 
a member.
Secret groups are all cool and funky for conversing with college buddies but have limited use in 
the world of marketing, so we will say no more about them. When you visit a group page, you 
will be able to see what they are all about and then decide whether you want to join one.
Join groups relevant to your industry, and make new friends once you join in. Start your own 
group as a really powerful, targeted marketing channel.

Start an event
Events are exactly what they say. Anybody can create an event page. The event page can 
then be visited by Facebook members, and they can interact with it. They can learn about 
the event, register attendance, or put themselves down as a maybe. The manner and 
amount of interaction is determined by the creator of the event page. Event pages, like 
regular pages, turn up on the profiles of people who have registered an interest in the event 
as well as on the profile of the person who created the event. Events can be anything from 
a presidential election to a walk in the park or a special discount day on a website. Are you 
beginning to see the potential here?
Start a page
These are web pages you can visit or create within the Facebook site. They, like any other 
web page, can be about almost anything.
When you find a page you like, you can click on a button to become a fan. You can also 
"share" a page with a friend to give them the opportunity to view and become a fan of 
the page. When you, or anyone else for that matter, are a fan of a page, the page's image 
appears fairly prominently on your profile page. This gives further visibility to the page when 
people are visiting their friends' profiles, as you do on Facebook. So where are all these 
pages? Click on the cool Facebook toolbar at the bottom-left part of the page and browse 
and create pages. Start building your fan base of targeted Facebook users.
Social media conclusion
Social media is the easiest and fastest way to be with your customers, because you can use it 
like a contact with your store and do some promotions.
Handling orders and checking payments
Any day now you're going to get an e-mail from PrestaShop saying you have a new order! 
When you have stopped dancing around the room, read on to learn about handling orders 
and much more.
Creating order messages
As you will see shortly, you have the facility to quickly send messages via e-mail to your 
customers by accessing their order. Considering that many of the messages will be identical, 
wouldn't it be useful to write those messages in advance and then, with the click of a button, 
send the message of our choice? Well, you can do that.

Chapter 8
[ 185 ]
Time for action – creating messages
Here's how you can create order messages:
1.	 Hover over the Orders tab and click on the Order Messages subtab. Then click on 
the green Add new button.
2.	 We are presented with a nice, simple form asking for the name of our message and 
the actual message itself. I suggest creating a message called Dispatch notification. 
Type in a brief and friendly message informing the customer that their product has 
been dispatched. You might like to create multiple versions of this message, perhaps 
for orders with different delivery methods, or times, or some other reason specific 
to your business.
3.	 Save the message and then create as many messages as you think you will need. 
You can, of course, come back at any time to create a new message for a situation 
you didn't anticipate. You might like to create more messages like the dispatch 
notification, such as Thanks for the cheque/bank wire. Perhaps you have special 
orders or fluctuations in stock that require you to notify a customer when their 
order or part order has arrived? Note that the Thanks for your order messages are 
done automatically by PrestaShop.
What just happened?
We have just composed some pre-prepared messages that we will use when processing 
customer orders. These can be great time savers; they help avoid a lot of typing. They also 
help us avoid errors and keep our customer contacts consistent.

[ 186 ]
Statuses
Statuses keep our customers informed of the state of an order. They can view order statuses 
when they log in to their respective accounts. Statuses are very useful for managing our shop 
as well. PrestaShop creates a number of default statuses for us. These will probably suit the 
needs of most shops. The next Time for action section will introduce statuses.
Time for action – statuses
Here we go.
1.	 Click on the Statuses subtab.
2.	 Take a look at all of the order statuses available to you by default.
3.	 Let's have a look at any one among them in detail. Click on the edit icon next to one 
of the statuses.

Chapter 8
[ 187 ]
4.	 Here is an explanation. As you can see, I have selected the Awaiting cheque 
payment status. I could, if I wanted to, browse to find a graphic to represent that 
status. I can see that the highlighted color, when an order has this status, will be 
royal blue. The next four checkboxes give you options related to the customer. 
Probably the most interesting option is the Template option. This defines the e-mail 
template used to send a message to the customer when an order reaches this state.
5.	 Click on the little eye icon to view the e-mail that the customer would receive.
6.	 Go back to the list when you're done.
7.	 In the unlikely event that you do not have enough status options, click on Add new 
and you will see the same form we were just looking at. Fill it out to match the new 
status you are after.
What just happened?
We looked at statuses and how to view at them in detail, including the message that a 
customer will receive. In the next two sections, we will actually make use of and change 
statuses as well as send some of the messages we created previously.
Checking payments
Click on the Orders tab. If you had processed a sale from your willing volunteer, you will see 
the order there. Notice the Paid status in the Status column.
This is all well and good, but how can we be sure we have the money? It is always worth 
double checking whether a payment has actually arrived and has not been reversed or 
cancelled. Also, note that with Google Checkout, the customer's card is merely verified and is 
not actually charged until the order is processed.

Ready to Sell
[ 188 ]
I suggest logging into your PayPal or Google Checkout account to verify that the list of orders 
you have in your PrestaShop control panel matches the payments received in your payment 
provider's transaction list. When you are satisfied that all is well, read on.
Processing an order
For this next guide, we will assume that the order is in stock and ready to be shipped. If the 
situation is different in your case, then simply select the appropriate status for you. Note that 
the Google Checkout terms and conditions say that you should not set the order's status to 
Processing or click on Charge until you are ready to actually ship the order.
Time for action – how to process an order
Let's process our first order:
1.	 Click on the Orders tab and then click on the order that you want to process.
2.	 Click on the drop-down box and change the status of the order, as shown in the 
following screenshot. For example, if you are packing the order and about to go to 
the post office, select the Shipped status.
3.	 Scroll to the bottom of the order details page and click on the send message link, as 
highlighted in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
[ 189 ]
4.	 Select an appropriate default message to keep the customer up-to-date or to write a 
new message.
5.	 Wrap the customer's order, or do whatever you need to fulfill the order. Notice that 
there are two addresses, invoice and delivery. Often these are the same, but not 
always. If they are different, be sure to send to the delivery address.
What just happened?
Now when you receive your first customer order, it can be a moment of joy and not one  
of panic.
Let's look in more detail at the Customers and Orders tabs to see some of your options.
More about the Customers and Orders tabs
Here is a whirlwind tour of the Customers and Orders tabs, covering the most useful 
functions that have not been covered so far.
Groups
Groups are potentially very useful. Not surprisingly, you can create groups and then add your 
customers to specific ones. The purpose is the interesting bit. You can then assign discounts 
to groups, and then all of the members of that group would qualify for that discount.

Ready to Sell
[ 190 ]
Time for action – creating and using groups
Perhaps wholesale and retail could constitute a common group. Here we will create a group 
called Wholesale, give the group 10 percent discount, and then add some customers to it.
1.	 Hover over the Customers tab, click on the Groups subtab, and then click on  
Add new:
2.	 Enter Wholesale in the Name field and 10 in the Discount (%) field.
3.	 Save your new group. Notice, in the list of groups, there is the new wholesale group 
and a default group. In this scenario, the default group would be our retail group.
4.	 Now click on the Customers tab and then click on the edit icon on one of the 
customers.
5.	 Select the checkbox to add the customer to the wholesale group, then click on Save.
6.	 The customer will now enjoy any discounts assigned to the wholesale group.
What just happened?
We now know how to use the groups feature and have looked at one possible use for it.
Customers
You just saw how we edited the membership of a group via the Customers tab. You can also 
view a list of all the customers via this tab. Notice the empty boxes above each of the fields 
in the table of customers?
We can use the empty boxes to enter dates, names, partial names, and so on. Then we can 
click on the Filter button to see a new list of customers based on the filtering requirements 
we specified.
Also, try clicking on the magnify icon at the end of a customer's name and look at the full 
customer detail summary that pops up.
Carts
The Shopping Carts tab under Customers is a very useful tool. We can see at a glance the 
carts that were created in our store and when they were created. Note that this tab is 
very distinct from Orders. Lots of carts being created that don't lead to orders could be an 
indication of a problem—perhaps something the customer didn't like that put them off, and 
it is probably worth investigating.
We can click on any of the carts and get an expanded description of it.

Chapter 8
[ 191 ]
Invoices
There are two main uses for invoices. First, our customers might want one, especially if they 
made a purchase for their businesses, and second, it is good practice to keep a copy for 
yourself for accounting purposes.
Time for action – Invoices
Make sure that you are logged in to your admin control panel and then read on.
1.	 Hover over the Orders tab and then click on the Invoices subtab.
2.	 In the Invoice options panel shown in the preceding screenshot, select Yes to enable 
invoices for your customers.
3.	 In the Invoice number box, you can specify the number of the next invoice to be 
generated. This is a great cheat for hiding the fact that your shop is brand new. 
When your first ever customer gets the invoice number 5456753, they will have no 
idea how special they really are.
4.	 Look at the button labeled Generate PDF file by date.
5.	 Specify a date period, perhaps the beginning and the end of a particular month.
6.	 Click on the Generate PDF file by date button and you can easily print all of your 
customer invoices for that month.
What just happened?
We saw how to enable and disable customer invoices as well as print invoices for our  
own records.
Merchandise returns
Here you can enable merchandise returns as well as specify the number of days after 
ordering for which this is acceptable.
Once this is enabled, you can then assign return statuses on you orders screen. This includes 
waiting for package, package received, refund given, and return denied.
Pop quiz –  Sell your products
Q1. I have a new product and I absolutely must shout out about it now. Which one of these 
is an appropriate outlet?
1.	 Talk to my family and friends about my new business.
2.	 Forums, specialized websites, search engine registration, and AdWords.
3.	 Search engine registration and AdWords.

[ 192 ]
Q2. What kind of products and shops benefit from a customer loyalty program?
1.	 Products that the customer buys only once a year.
2.	 Products that the customer often buys.
3.	 Only rare items.
Q3. How else would you market your site for free?
1.	 By having a good SEO strategy, writing good posts, and giving good customer service.
2.	 By having a good customer service.
3.	 Using SEO is more than enough.

The future of e-commerce and PrestaShop
So let's get on with it.
Why are we here?
My science teacher used to boom this question across the classroom and scare half the class 
into paying attention. But it is a good question and well worth thinking about.
What is critical, especially in this type of business, is to understand what we are trying to 
achieve. This is necessary because a deep understanding and certainty of purpose will guide 
our actions. Although our PrestaShop store might be just about done, our business must 
have a real and clear purpose, and path, in order for us to achieve the maximum we can with 
our newfound knowledge.

Go… to the Future
[ 194 ]
So why did we open a PrestaShop store? Why did you buy this book? For some of you, it 
might be simple curiosity about PrestaShop or perhaps e-commerce in general. I am guessing 
that for the majority of us, it was to start a business. And for any number of good reasons, 
you specifically chose PrestaShop.
But why did you want to start a business at all? Well, that's obvious you might say—to make 
money. But why make money? To pay the bills. It is probably obvious what I am hinting at. 
You may think here that there is some impending lecture on home-work balance—I promise 
you, there won't be.
However, I hope you have considered exactly what you would like to provide for yourself and 
your family through this business. In particular, are you doing this for the thrill of an online 
business? That's fine, I am. Or are you just looking at an online business to provide you with 
the means to give yourself and your family what you deserve? That's fine as well, me too.
I just wanted to point out one or two things that might not be immediately obvious.
The power of e-commerce and a passive income
You have, at this stage, an opportunity for a little bit more than just paying the bills. I am 
not suggesting that we should, all or any of us, try and be extremely wealthy entrepreneurs. 
There isn't anything wrong with that, though. I am not suggesting we should, all or any of us, 
be big business people and dominate our markets, although that is OK as well.
I am not even suggesting that we should consider e-commerce, PrestaShop, or any other 
e-business tool to be anything more important than just that, a mere tool. But it would be 
negligent of me, having strung you along for more than 200 pages, not to double check 
whether you fully realized the power and potential of what you just started.
The busy billionaire
I admire people who work hard. And to have a successful e-commerce business, you have to 
work very hard indeed. But unlike a high-powered job or conventional self-employment, a 
self-built e-commerce website offers the opportunity for income without the massive time 
constraints and life-dominating commitment required by most other businesses and by every 
form of employment.
I am not trying to describe an income that is necessarily big, although it can be, but an 
income that you control and not one that controls you.

Chapter 9
[ 195 ]
The rest of this chapter will go on to explain how to use PrestaShop in conjunction with 
other tools to grow your income, but with only a very minimal time commitment. Starting a 
business like this should not be the precursor to a full-time job. In fact, just the opposite can 
be true.
What I am trying to get to is this: PrestaShop, when used efficiently, can be the start of a 
significant passive income. That is, an income that keeps coming in, even when you are not 
actually working on it. Don't believe me? Read on.
Learning from competitors
If there is something that our competitors have, it is their level of learning. We could have 
the best e-commerce site in the world but we need to keep an eye on our competitors, 
because your customers will be doing exactly that.
On the Internet, it is very easy to check different stores in few minutes; you need to give 
something more to your customers. This could be very good customer service, an amazing 
design, price, items, and so on; they could all help keep the customers in your store. For that, 
you need to learn from your competitors; maybe they have the key, and you can learn it and 
improve it.
Perpetual analysis, improvement, and marketing
The key theme here is in the word perpetual, which means continuing without interruption. 
Marketing, optimizing, and improving your website is not a one-off job. It has to be done on 
an ongoing basis—it is never finished. That's the bad news. The good news is that it doesn't 
have to take long, just so long as it is done on a regular basis. And as your website becomes 
more established, I would suggest that the amount of time you spend on optimization be 
decreased, as long as the frequency is maintained. This is good news and sits well with our 
plan for a passive income.
First of all, let's look at how we can measure the performance of our PrestaShop site.
Analyzing statistics
In Chapter 5, Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics, we set up the PrestaShop 
statistics modules as well as installed Google Analytics. Now we will look at how you can use 
them to understand some areas for change and improvement in your PrestaShop store. It 
is also worth pointing out that, quite often, the statistics gathered by Analytics will overlap 
with what have been gathered by PrestaShop. However, as we will see, both do have unique 
statistics that the other doesn't. First of all, we will look at the built-in PrestaShop features.

PrestaShop statistics
Look at the huge menu of stats options in the next screenshot. We very briefly looked at 
them in Chapter 5, Tools, Newsletters, Extra Income, and Statistics. Here we will try and 
deduce how to use them in a practical way. Try and glean useful information that can then be 
used to make changes and improve our stores. You can access the menu by clicking on the 
Stats tab. The menu is located toward the bottom, on the left-hand side of the page.

Chapter 9
[ 197 ]
The actual statistics themselves are very straightforward, but sometimes their meaning 
is less obvious. We will cover the most common, useful stats, but what is useful to one 
business might not be to another. Be sure to think about all of the information PrestaShop 
gathers for you and how you might be able to use it.
Pages not found
First up is Pages not found. This happens when a visitor tries to visit a page on our site that 
doesn't exist. This statistic then records the details of pages that visitors tried to visit that 
don't exist and how often it happened.
What you are aiming for is to get the message shown in the screenshot shown just previously. 
No pages registered means there were no pages that couldn't be found. If you have one or 
more pages not found, it is probably a really good idea to find out why and fix this.
A common cause of pages not found is broken links (that is, you have made a link on your 
site and mistyped the URL). Perhaps you created a link in an article to ./teddybearf when 
it should have been ./teddybears. This would cause an entry to be created in the Pages 
not found statistics. Another cause for this is where the page was real but was, for some 
reason, removed. Then when visitors click on links to the page, which should otherwise not 
have been removed, you will get the details of this here.
When a customer comes across a broken link, it is highly likely that they will give up on  
your site. So check the Pages not found statistics regularly and fix or remove links that  
cause problems.

Best products, best categories, and catalog statistics
These three statistics pages can be used in conjunction with one another. Why not go and 
have a look at the Best products, Best categories, and Catalog statistics now. The Catalog 
statistics category has been shown in the following screenshot:
On the Best products page, there is a wealth of information. See the following screenshot:

On the Best categories screen, we can see a narrower range of statistics that tell us about a 
broader range of subjects (a whole category of products). See the following screenshot:
From this information, we can see the best selling categories and products, which of course 
is interesting, but we can deduce something much more useful as well.
On the Best products page, look at the Quantity sold and Page viewed columns. From these 
two figures, we can see how effective our product offering is. Have you received 150-page 
views without a sale? There is probably a problem.
Is the price good? If it is, then how full is the description and how clear are the images? If you 
pass the last two tests, consider taking a look at your sales copy and referring to Chapter 3, 
Merchandising for Success to see whether you are using the best possible sales copy.
A "good" conversion rate varies dramatically from industry to industry, but if you are getting 
five sales for every 100 page views, you can give yourself a pat on the back. If yours is lower 
than this, do not despair, it might just be normal for your type of product.
You can use the same technique to judge the effectiveness of categories, including the 
category page and all of the products in the category combined. Use exactly the same 
technique, but this time, use the figures from the best category page. You will often find the 
number of sales per view is lower for the category page than for the product page.
Now look at the Catalog statistics page; you will see the average sales and page views across 
the whole store. Page views to sales, at any level, are a really good benchmark to measure 
your success. It is much more worthwhile to measure your improvement than to try and 
compare with somebody else's figures (or even the figures I just gave). The figures I gave are 
just a very rough guide.
If you think you could improve, we will look at a plan for continuous improvement in a bit.

Shop search
This page is simple. It shows you the search terms being used in your search box. This is 
obviously distinct from the search terms being used on the search engines; we will come to 
them when we look at Google Analytics.
The terms that people use to search your shop can tell you many things. For example, if 
people are searching extensively for a particular term or two, it means that they are finding 
your site easily, but perhaps the specific item or article they are looking for is proving to be 
more elusive.
Visit your shop front and try out the search term. Does it take you to the page you expected? 
If not, you probably need to look at your meta tags and search weightings (discussed in 
Chapter 4, Getting More Customers). If it does give you the expected page, great! But that 
is not necessarily the end of the matter. If people are using a search term a lot, is it worth 
making the thing easier to find? You could perhaps feature it on the home page, have it added 
to your tag cloud, or make the category more prominent by moving it up the category list 
order. Not all these things should definitely be done, but should at least be considered. Don't 
rush off and do it now. Make a note, and we will look at when to schedule such tasks soon.
PrestaShop statistics summary
The statistics features that are useful to you will not be the same as those that are useful to 
everybody else. Try and get familiar with all of them and then apply your knowledge of your 
industry to make them useful to you.
Google Analytics
Log in to your Analytics account and look at the huge menu of Analytics options. Here we will 
try and deduce how to make use of them. Try and glean useful meaning from the data, which 
can then be used to make changes and improve our stores.
Like Google AdWords (more soon), Analytics is a massive topic. I will cover perhaps the most 
useful features here. However, if you find that using these features is getting results, then I 
would definitely recommend further study. For example, you can link Analytics to AdWords 
to fully explore how viable your AdWords are. But that goes beyond the space we have here. 
Let's get on with it.
Audience
The following screenshot shows the number of daily visitors to a website. This is interesting, 
and of course, we should strive to increase it. This screenshot only displays the number of 
daily visitors for a month. However, you use the buttons at the top-right corner to change the 
date range to whatever you like.

Go… to the Future
[ 202 ]
If you are a brand new store, a short date range can be very telling. If you have been open for 
a while, extend the overall date range, and look for a steady upward increase.
Log in to Analytics, select your site, and click on Audience. We will discuss some of the mines 
of precious information that you can dig up on the Audience tab.
You have options like new versus returning. This tells us how many of our visitors are repeat 
customers and how many are new. The actual figures are imperfect because the technology 
is also imperfect at detecting return visitors. But it is a very good guide.
Not enough return visitors? You need to give people a reason to come back to your store. 
Perhaps the customer loyalty scheme discussed in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell can help, or a 
discount voucher may be sent out to existing customers. If there aren't enough new visitors, 
you need to employ all the marketing tools that you can. Have a look at the following 
screenshot; it compares new and returning visitors:

Chapter 9
[ 203 ]
You can also click on Frequency & Recency to see a full breakdown of the number of 
customers who visited once or more than once.
Engagement is a great indicator of how long people stayed, and describes this in great detail. 
It shows how many stayed for 0 to 10 seconds, 11 to 30 seconds, and so on. Your aim is to 
get people to browse your site for as long as possible. If you are getting a high percentage 
of your visitors who leave in under 30 seconds, look into the pages (in detail) that they are 
viewing (and not liking). Then try and work out why, and fix it.
Have a look at your map overlay. It allows you to hover your mouse pointer over different 
regions of the world and see where your visitors live. If you're getting lots of visitors from 
countries you don't ship to or from countries that speak languages you don't cater for, it 
might be time for a rethink.
The options under Audience are immense, and exploring them is highly recommended.  
We will soon look at how to best spend time searching for and using statistics.
Traffic sources
Traffic sources refers to the manner in which our visitors arrived at our site, as opposed to 
the geographical location talked about earlier. The options are: links from other sites, the 
different search engines, and people typing in a URL or clicking on a bookmark.
If you don't have many referrals from other websites, you need to start marketing your site 
on forums, blogs, and social media. If you find that any of the major search engines are 
missing your site completely, then you need to check whether you registered. Go back and 
check Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.
Under Traffic Sources Overview, you can click on keywords and see mountains of 
information about the keywords that made search engines send visitors to your site. This can 
be very revealing. Are they what you expected? Do you need to refine your search engine 
optimization discussed in Chapter 4, Getting More Customers or do you need to start writing 
articles and creating product categories or product descriptions for a whole new set of 
keywords? Think about it, but don't rush off and do anything major until you have read the 
rest of this chapter.
Content
Content, as the title suggests, gets down to the specifics of each page. The simplest use of 
content statistics is to determine how many entrances to your site came from each page. See 
which pages had the most views overall. These are the ones that must be made as perfect as 
possible. That is, you can use the best sales copy, the best images, or if it's an article, make 
sure it is linked to the appropriate product pages. However, don't change too much; the page 
could lose its popularity if you change too many keyword attributes.

Google Analytics summary
As with the PrestaShop statistics, the Analytics features that are useful to you will not be the 
same as those that are useful to somebody else. Try and get familiar with all of them and 
then apply knowledge of your industry to make them useful to you.
Improvement
Hopefully, the discussion on statistics will enable you to identify potential areas for change. 
But perhaps most of the enhancing and updating will be done based on your knowledge of 
your industry or how it is changing. For examples, read on.
Optimizing your articles, product descriptions, and category descriptions
You should constantly be updating your articles to keep them current. If something changes 
in your industry, and that affects something in one of your articles, change the article. You 
might be surprised at how quickly the search engines pick up on it. Thought of a better way 
to describe a product? Then update that too. Can you improve your grammar in any way? 
Can you use your statistics to change or optimize the density of the actual keywords that  
you use? Did you find a new great image to use somewhere on your site? Constantly 
updating and amending your content keeps it fresh and scores big marks with search  
engines and humans.
Adding new articles
Keep looking out for new topics to write articles about. Once your articles have been indexed 
by the search engines, you might be amazed at how responsive they are. I have added new 
articles and found them in search results just hours later. And this can be true for sites with 
fairly modest profiles.
So if there is something important, topical, or controversial in your industry, write about it 
and make sure it is linked with other relevant articles on your site. Having said what I have, 
don't write articles for the sake of it. If it is not genuinely relevant, don't bother. If a once-
relevant article has become irrelevant, take it down. It is not a competition about quantity 
but quality and relevance.
Marketing
We have already talked about many different forms of marketing. The main point to make 
here is that these forms of marketing should also be perpetual. If you log in to your industry 
forum once every six months and post a hundred messages, you will be judged as a self-
promoter and there will be no benefit to your business. If, however, you post a small number 
of relevant messages or replies once a week across all the platforms, you will reap enormous 
benefits over time.

Chapter 9
[ 205 ]
It is the same with e-mail marketing your site. If you send an e-mail a day for a week, your 
subscribers will be reaching for the spam button. However, sending one well-constructed 
newsletter per month (or whatever frequency is right for you) will bring new customers and 
repeat customers.
You know how to make changes to your AdWords campaign. This too is best looked at on 
a perpetual basis, at a frequency relevant to your specific business. So if you are getting 60 
percent of all your sales via AdWords, then you should look at it with a higher frequency 
than for when you have a small spend with small returns.
Devising a routine and sticking to it
Think about all the things we have talked about. You could make some notes and then  
read on.
Time for action – making a plan
This quick guide will help you create a monthly plan for perpetual improvement of your 
website. The key is to be as efficient as possible and take up as little time as possible, but at 
the same time, making sure that nothing is being neglected.
1.	 Write down a list of all the different marketing activities you are involved in and, 
next to that, the frequency with which you think you should be doing them. Next to 
that, also write the amount of time (in hours) you think it will take.
2.	 Write down a list of all the optimization activities that you expect to engage in, and 
(like you did in the previous point) the frequency and expected time you will take for 
each activity.
3.	 Now do exactly the same as the previous step, but this time, as an estimate for 
adding new content. This includes articles, categories, and products.
4.	 Now estimate the amount of time that you will set aside for customer service and 
the handling of orders (which you will probably be doing quite frequently).
5.	 Now using that information, write out a monthly plan showing the days divided into 
one-hour slots so that you can see the spare time that you have.
6.	 Your final plan should show a very small amount of time, perhaps for each day 
(for me it is an hour per day), for customer service and packing. You will probably 
have a frequently recurring block. For me, it is half a day per week that I spend on 
marketing, optimizing, and adding. The vast majority of your monthly planner will 
hopefully, at least for now, be empty.

Go… to the Future
[ 206 ]
What just happened?
The result should show vast empty spaces, to be spent as you please. If you have achieved 
your financial objectives, this time could be spent just doing what you please. If, like me, you 
have not achieved this yet, you could spend the spare time working on new projects. More 
on this soon.
It is worth mentioning that while writing this book, I spent no more than a few hours a week 
across all my stores. But my income went up! The amount of time you spend developing 
your PrestaShop store is not that important, but what matters is what you actually do with 
the time.
Now that we have the management of our websites down to a tee, we can look at what we 
would like to do with all our newly-found spare time.
The big secret
So you have a working e-commerce business and you know how to develop and increase 
profitability. We have also discussed how to do this with the smallest time commitment 
possible. Starting an e-commerce business should not be about becoming a full-time, online 
equivalent of a shelf stacker, checkout operator, and store manager, all rolled into one. It is 
about getting technology to go to work for you.
There comes a time when any business begins to reach its full potential, and it is just as 
important to know that the development and improvement cycle we discussed earlier takes 
time, perhaps years. What if you are not making all you want from your store yet? What if 
you have successfully replaced whatever income you previously had, but you now have a 
taste of success and you want more? What should you do?
Just do what every successful business has always done. But first, a bit about conventional 
business.
High street retail
Walk down any shopping street or any modern shopping mall in almost any town or city 
around the world and you are faced with a wall of recognizable brands. McDonalds is an 
obvious example.
In 1954, a milkshake machine salesman called Ray Kroc was fascinated by why one particular 
hamburger restaurant in California, USA was so much more successful than any of his 
other customers' restaurants. There were a number of elements that made the McDonald 
brothers' restaurant better than the others, but that is not the point of the story.

Chapter 9
[ 207 ]
Ray Kroc made a deal with the McDonald brothers and started opening more burger 
restaurants using their successful formula. Every new restaurant brought a significant increase 
in sales, but without the initial risk and time commitment of the first. Why? It had been done 
before, he knew it worked, and he knew (from experience) how to get up and running very 
quickly and avoid all of the pitfalls. Ten years later, there were 700 McDonalds restaurants.
So how does this help us? You have reached this point, so you already know how to open 
an e-commerce business. You know how to run it without a significant investment in time. 
So what are you going to do next? I struggled to open my first e-commerce store. It took 
months, and it looked awful, and I mean it when I say awful. But guess what? It worked 
because I used open source software that had already been tried and tested by thousands of 
other businesses, and people purchased my stuff. Not much initially, but in time.
So I opened another. This time it was a bit smarter-looking, took only a few weeks, and was 
a little bit more successful. Can you guess what I did next? Yes, I opened another one and it 
was even easier than the last one. And I didn't stop there.
For those of you who have completed my 7-day challenge, congratulations! For those of you 
who took a bit longer, much longer, or are still waiting for your first customer, don't worry 
about it; keep going. Keep refining your PrestaShop and don't wait for it to be a hit before 
you open another one.
Duplication
The technical term for copying a successful business over and over is duplication. Think 
about McDonalds again for a moment. Why did it work for them? Two important factors 
were that first, people liked it, and second, when people went to another town or city, they 
saw the golden arches and recognized it as a brand they liked. This, of course, is how all of 
the big names on the high street succeed, with duplication—brand awareness. And brand 
awareness is where my suggested model of duplication is completely different from that of 
the high street.
If you walk through a mall, you see all the usual suspects. Go and take a look at their online 
presence. They usually only have one main web store. Why? Simple, because as we talked 
about just now, people are drawn in by brand awareness. For the high street or a shopping 
mall, they are drawn in by location and brand awareness. On the Internet, having five Circuit 
City computer store websites won't work. They are only successful because the name and 
perhaps the domain name are very well-known.
This can't help us because we don't want to spend loads of money building brand awareness. 
So how are we going to duplicate our business?

Go… to the Future
[ 208 ]
Look at it like this
When I was a very young boy, I used to love going to the local corner shop to buy a quarter 
of Cola Cubes. Sometimes, I would be sent on a short errand to get a loaf of bread or a pint 
of milk. Other times, we would all go in the car and get a whole load of things because we 
didn't have time to go to the supermarket that week. That little corner shop was a busy, 
bustling, and thriving business. It was a part of our local community, and a big part of my 
small world back then.
As I got a little older and travelled further afield, I noticed that there were other corner 
shops. Not always on actual corners, but the same type of thing. They would all specialize in 
something slightly different, but still have a core range of everyday products. There was one 
that had a great range of toys, another had books, another had baked goods, and so on.
And eventually, I realized that these places existed in the thousands all over the UK. And 
those similar businesses existed in the millions across every continent in the world. The point 
is that they were all successful businesses in their own right. How did they all succeed, so 
close to one another? Perhaps the obvious answer is that they all served their own specific 
community, defined approximately by distance from the next corner shop.
An analogy to explain
It is true that the independently owned, small-store business is in something of a decline, 
at least in the UK anyway. But only because the big companies are buying them or replacing 
them, not because that type of business has no demand. Big companies can use their 
financial might to monopolize this market just as they did for the high street, malls, and out-
of-town sites. It is hard, if not impossible, to compete.
But on the Web, the rules are very different and the advantage, I believe, is with the small 
business. Here is why. Tesco has the largest share of the UK supermarket business with 
hundreds of stores around the country. They also have an incredibly successful online 
presence through www.tesco.com, which delivers the customers' shopping to their homes. 
So if it is so successful, why don't they open another website that does the same thing and 
multiply their business? Perhaps www.tesco-two.com. I checked, the name is available. 
Simply because all that would happen is that if the site was successful, it would only get 
business from the existing site, www.tesco.com. There would be no new customers because 
Tesco's online business, like the other big names, is entirely dependent on their brand 
awareness. Herein lies the first major difference between our duplication model and theirs.
When we create another store, it must be different from the last—with a new domain name, 
new product and category descriptions, perhaps a slightly varied range, and perhaps even 
new prices. By creating an apparently unique business, we are potentially doubling our 
income. Why does this work for us but not for Tesco or other big businesses?

Chapter 9
[ 209 ]
I am well aware that at this point I have created more questions than I have answered. This 
works for us and not the big boys because we do it ourselves in a fraction of the time and at a 
microscopic percentage of the cost to them. With their unwieldy, inflexible size, they cannot 
specialize in niches. They would need designers, buyers, marketing, staff, managers, and the 
list goes on. We need a spare day or two and $5 a month for hosting, if that is the case.
The returns on such an investment would be too slow for a shareholder-owned organization. 
And the one thing that the big boys will never have, which is essential to make a success of 
this type of business, is a person with the passion for the products and a commitment to its 
success. Money can never buy this.
What about all these corner shops?
So why did I go on about the corner shops? What have they got to do with it? Simple; think 
about search engine optimization for a minute. It is a bit unclear, to say the least. What 
keywords to use, what density, page structure, formatting, whether to use meta tags or not! 
It makes my head spin.
Big organizations and others that have only one main website have to get it right—exactly 
right, or their business will fail. They have to spend fortunes researching keywords, 
buying Google AdWords, paying affiliates, and the list goes on. Most of these tasks rely on 
employing expensive outside agencies or in-house "experts" because they have no choice 
but to get it right. And guess what happens when Google or another one of the search 
engines changes its ranking formula? They start again on an endless frantic circle of trying to 
convince the search engines that they should be at the top.
Yes, we must optimize and refine, as discussed earlier. However, if we have a dozen stores 
all feeding off of slightly different keywords and phrases, all with their own slightly different 
structure, formatting, and density, then any change in the search engine ranking formula is 
just as likely to benefit some of our stores as it is to be detrimental to others. We win. Oh 
yes, the corner shops.
Our websites are just like the corner shops. They are small, well-run, highly efficient, have 
zero unnecessary expenses, and make a modest income (each) by offering genuine products 
and services, preferably to repeat customers.
Where the analogy most applies with corner shops is, by making each site unique, we end 
up placing ourselves on lots of different virtual corners created by the vagaries of the search 
engines. If I have a laptop shop, do I optimize for laptops, notebooks, netbooks, or portable 
PCs? It doesn't matter all that much because I can optimize for them all, placing myself on as 
many virtual corners as I like.
These days, when people search for my products, I am confident that no matter what they 
call them, one of my sites will appear in the organic search results. The money, when they 
buy something, all goes to the same place.

Go… to the Future
[ 210 ]
The corner shop analogy stops working when we have only a tiny financial investment per 
store, almost zero time commitment once it is up and running, and an ongoing residual 
income for the foreseeable future! So let's get duplicating.
Technical duplication tips
So we know that our stores must be different because we are not aiming for success through 
brand awareness, although you might surprise yourself and end up with one or more of your 
sites becoming well-known, but that is not our specific goal here.
Varying your payment provider
Let's say you have a dozen thriving stores, you and your family are starting to live the life you 
deserve and all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, PayPal suspends your account. Hero 
to zero, and there is probably nothing you can do about it. Even if there is, it will almost 
certainly take time to get to the bottom of what got PayPal into a tizzy. And please believe 
me, they do get into a tizzy from time to time.
When you do your second PrestaShop site, why not choose an alternative payment provider? 
There are others, as well as the few options we looked at earlier. Visit www.prestastore.
com and www.presto-changeo.com to see the list of payment modules available for 
PrestaShop.
Once you have a few stores up and running with different payment methods, consider 
installing two or more options in each store. Then, if a payment provider becomes unusable 
for any reason, you can simply disable the unwanted one and enable another. You can also 
consider having more than one enabled at the same time to give your customers a choice.
Varying your web host
Problems can arise with web hosts. Problems such as downtime can occur, they can get 
hacked, and so on. Keeping all of your websites on one host could be catastrophic. It is 
certainly okay to have a few per host, otherwise our web-hosting bill would quickly go 
through the roof, but don't keep too many for each.
The other good reason to vary your web host is that in a shared hosting environment, the IP 
address that identifies your web server could be the same for all sites. This could potentially 
cause issues with the search engines, which might object to too many related sites being on 
the same IP address.
Varying your content
This is crucial. You can save time by using your old content as a template and also perhaps 
using some of the same images, but your category, product, and article pages must be 
unique or the site will not perform in search engine rankings, because it might be considered 
as duplicate content.

Chapter 9
[ 211 ]
Also, like the corner shops, vary your products. Once you are making a profit, which should be 
almost straight away, consider adding new products or even whole ranges. Vary the products 
and ranges that you put into different stores. After a year or two, it will start becoming 
apparent as to which store is going to be your top performer; you can use this as your main 
store to try out new things and then move successful products into different stores.
Varying your cart software
PrestaShop is arguably the best. But there are loads, and I mean loads, of alternatives. The 
truth is that depending upon the criteria you use to judge the software, different products 
come out best. For example, if you are getting lots of visitors from your articles, and there 
are lots more that you could write, you definitely need to consider an open source solution 
where the focus is on the CMS, but with a shop attached. Check out www.wordpress.org, 
and get a great book on the subject from www.packtpub.com.
If you want to stick with the traditional e-commerce model but want to vary your structure 
and formatting (at the same time as getting your teeth into a new open source software title 
with different advantages and features), then go and have a look at www.zen-cart.com, 
www.oscommerce.net, or www.magentocommerce.com.
Also consider some quick and simple regular HTML websites. Make yourself a really simple 
three or four-page website. Use the template of your choice for free, from www.oswd.org, 
and put on some simple buy now buttons, which you can create in your Google Checkout or 
PayPal account.
Try something totally new
I always wanted to have my own business but I never wanted one of the traditional forms of 
self-employment. I wanted to do something a bit different. The problem is, I am risk averse. 
It never ceases to amaze me the courage shown by some entrepreneurs while financing their 
new ventures: huge loans, re-mortgages, and so on.
The problem with this type of venture, of course, is that there are consequences if the 
business is not a success. I am, for this reason, a sort of do-it-yourself e-commerce kind of 
person. If a business fails, then I have lost some time, not my shirt, and if during that time 
I was earning money from other businesses, then it is not too much of a problem. As your 
experience of different software solutions grows, something happens inside your brain. Let 
me explain.
You begin to realize just how vast and varied the world of open source is. Just about anything 
can be achieved on the Web, for nothing or almost nothing when you do it yourself, and 
you would be surprised how simple some of the things actually are, when you thought they 
would be really hard.

Go… to the Future
[ 212 ]
As this world of possibilities dawns on you, if it hasn't already, you might find, all of a sudden 
that your ideas have become much more varied and adventurous. For example, I found 
myself dabbling in the likes of education websites, product comparisons, and business 
services as well as good old e-commerce.
Once you have a virtually passive income and just a little knowledge in a lot of fields, you 
will find that ideas for new websites come faster than you can possibly use them. Why not 
diversify totally? Think through these marvelous possibilities, plan how realistic they are, and 
dive into your favorite. I have found, without exception, that there is always the opportunity 
for cross-promotion with your existing businesses.
And if the fluffy teddy or bikes business falls a bit flat for a year or two, your diversification 
will make your income more resilient. If you see yourself as an entrepreneur, I recommend 
investigating a few technologies. You do not need to master any of them, just understand 
the basics and how to use the hard work done by others to your advantage. If this is you, 
read about HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL writing for the Web and web development in 
general. You can get beginner's books on many of these topics from www.packtpub.com.
The future of e-commerce and PrestaShop
So you want to know what will be the next big thing. Well this is it. Are you ready?
We can only guess the changes that will occur in the world of e-commerce. New customer 
trends will surely come and go; new features that we can only imagine will appear in 
shopping cart software. For example, in the short time that elapsed while writing this book, 
PrestaShop went through two versions and had multiple upgrades.
As we have discussed at length, your first PrestaShop store is only the beginning. The 
possibilities are only restricted by our imaginations. All you need to decide is what part you 
are going to play. Keeping abreast of new developments in technology is the key to taking 
advantage of all the possibilities that future opportunities present. In the appendix, there is 
a list of online resources. Why not visit them all and join any forums that look interesting. 
Introduce yourself, watch the conversations that interest you, and join in the discussion 
when you can. You will quickly have your finger on the pulse of e-business.

Picture this
It's 6 o'clock on Monday morning. You are not really looking forward to another grueling 
week at work. Another five days of office politics. Another small chunk of your life dedicated 
to making somebody else rich—giving somebody else's family the finer things in life, while 
somebody else decides what you are worth by the hour!
And then you remember you don't do that anymore. You started your own online  
business about six months ago and handed in your notice last Friday. You go downstairs and 
make a coffee. It smells good. You sit in your favorite chair and switch on your laptop. You 
check your e-mails.
You see you have made some more sales overnight. You log in to your PrestaShop control 
panel and all of the payments have been confirmed. You process the orders. You check the 
news headlines as you sip your coffee. You shut down your laptop. You ponder your next  
big idea. The day is your own while PrestaShop works slavishly. What will you do and where 
will you go?

Go… to the Future
[ 214 ]
Summary
Well, that's just about it. This chapter covered:


The point of running our own e-business in the first place


How to develop your business in an ongoing manner


The big secret to multiplying your business income in whichever way you want


The future of business on the Internet—it's hard to predict but with a bit of effort, 
simple to keep up with
I wish you every success with your PrestaShop business and please let me know how you 
get on via www.tizonsoft.net/en/contact. Much more than this, I hope you take 
advantage of the huge opportunity presented to us all through open source projects like 
PrestaShop.
In a world becoming more and more dominated by giant institutions that can sometimes 
seek to control how much we earn and the type of lives that we lead, we can use the world 
of open source to take back what should be ours and find ourselves much better placed to 
provide for our families and serve our communities.

A
Control Panel Quick Reference
What follows here is a really a brief account of every tab and subtab.  
While we have already covered the tabs, I will remind you in which chapter(s) 
this occurred.
Catalog
On the Catalog tab you can quickly create, edit, and delete categories and products. Here is 
what you will find on the subtabs:
Products
Here you can list, edit, add, and delete new products in your store.
Categories
In this subcategory, you can separate your products into different groups.
Monitoring
This is a summary of your shop categories including empty categories, disabled, and  
out-of-stock products.
Attributes and Values
This is a very powerful feature that enables you define product attributes, group them, and 
then assign them to products. This can be a big timesaver as well as really useful to your 
catalog and your customers.

Control Panel Quick Reference
[ 216 ]
Features
This is a great way to add a list of product features to a separate tab underneath the main 
product description. This is a good place to put all the information a customer might want 
to know without cluttering the main product description. See Chapter 3, Merchandising for 
Success.
Suppliers
You can enter the names and extra information about your suppliers. There are a number of 
good reasons for doing this. If your supplier is a trade secret then this one is not for you.
Image Mapping
This is cool. Assign multiple clickable zones to an image so that different product pages can 
be opened by a single image. Go and have a look on the Image Mapping subtab. A full guide 
is given there.
Tags
Create tags for any or all of your products, and assign different tags for each language.
Attachments
This is potentially very useful. Here is an example. On the Attachments tab click on Add new 
attachment. An attachment is a file, perhaps an image or a PDF file. Then on your product 
creation page you can click on its attachment tab and add as many attachments as you like. 
Now on the products page that the customer sees, there will be a downloads tab. This is 
great for technical documents, instructions, large images, or anything else you might want 
the customer to have access to but do not want to actually put in the product description.
Orders
Quickly see and sort all the orders you have received. Click on an order to process it.  
Order processing is covered in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell. Here is what you can do on the 
Orders subtabs:

Appendix A
[ 217 ]
Subtab
Description
Invoices
There are two main uses for invoices. First, our 
customers might want one, especially if they made a 
purchase for their business, and second, it is a good 
practice to keep a copy for yourself for your accounting 
purposes. There’s more in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.
Merchandise Returns
Here you can enable merchandise returns as well as 
specify the number of days after order that this is 
acceptable. There’s more in Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.
Delivery Slips
Print and configure delivery slips.

PrestaShop software what is occurring with any order.

read on Chapter 8, Ready to Sell.
Order Messages
Here you can add and amend customer messages. This 
is useful for sending messages that need to be sent 
many times. Chapter 8, Ready to Sell, looks at how to 
create and send messages.
Customers
Here you will find a list of customers. Click on one to view or edit the details. Here is a 
summary of all the subtabs under the Customers tab:
Subtabs

for full details. Read the following pages for a summary of the Shipping subtabs:
Subtabs
Description
Carriers

Checkouts and Shipping, gives you full reference on this.

mentioned, installed, and configured in just about every chapter.

repository.
Positions

exceptions for pages where you do not want a module to appear.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're 
using to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books 
you have seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused 
information, giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, 
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For 
more information, please visit our website: www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order 
to continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand, 
home to books published on software built around Open Source licences, and offering 
information to anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open 
Source brand also runs Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty 
to each Open Source project about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you 
would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get 
some additional reward for your expertise.
