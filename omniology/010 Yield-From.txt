Delegating to another iterator
Often we may need to delegate yielding elements to another iterator
file1.csv
file2.csv
file3.csv
def read_all_data():
for file in ('file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 'file3.csv'):
with open(file) as f:
for line in f:
yield line
The inner loop is basically just using the file iterator and yielding values directly
Essentially we are delegating yielding to the file iterator

We can replace this inner loop by using a simpler syntax:
yield from
Simpler Syntax
def read_all_data():
for file in ('file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 
'file3.csv'):
with open(file) as f:
for line in f:
yield line
def read_all_data():
for file in ('file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 
'file3.csv'):
with open(file) as f:
yield from f
We'll come back to yield from, as there is a lot more to it!
