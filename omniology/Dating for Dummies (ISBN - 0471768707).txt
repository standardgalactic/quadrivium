Dedication
To everyone who’s out there giving it the old camper’s try — courage!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Writing is hard, lonely work, which is why this section is so often over the top
in sentiment. People who were there when you were going through the labor,
saw you sweaty and cranky, and still stuck by you are much to be valued, and
this group certainly qualifies.
Tami Booth was the midwife, if ever there was one. From moment one, she
stayed the course, even with elements that seemed part of a cruel joke. 
Kathy Welton backed the project, even if it meant taking on the gods of con-
formity and wrestling them to the ground. Tracy Barr kept the work feasible
when the effort was literally dissolving before everyone’s horrified eyes, and I
thank her husband and babies for sharing her with me for weeks of phone
calls and faxes and really dedicated work. Mary Hogan slapped life into a pro-
ject that seemed oxygen-deprived and calmed me with her willingness to help
and set limits. Kevin Thornton rode in on his trusty white horse to shepherd
the project to the final glory.
The revision team included another Tracy as well as Kristin, Alissa, Trish —
thanks unto them and Odaliz Rivera, who made sense of everybody’s
scratches.
I also want to thank all my callers who’ve shared their tales of woe or wonder;
friends and family members (you know who you are) who’ve called at 2 a.m. to
cry or celebrate; and certainly all the guys who’ve made me part of the great
dating experience. 
If you see yourself in this book, think kindly of both of us, because, after all,
when it comes to dating, we’re all dummies.

Introduction
D
ating makes everybody feel like a dummy, whether you’re 15 or 115,
going out on your first date or rejoining the dating scene after your
grandkids have started dating. “It’s still the same old story” — as sung by
Dooley Wilson in Casablanca — “a search for love and glory,” and there really
are some fundamental things that do apply. I lay them all out for you, not so
that you can be a stud muffin or the hottest kid on the block, but so that you
can understand a bit more about yourself, your date to be, and the whole
process. Then maybe the old palms will sweat less, and believe it or not, you
may actually have some fun.
After all, dating should be fun. It’s not like your whole life or livelihood depends
on one date or several dates. The purpose of dating is simple: getting to know
someone and letting them get to know you so that you can decide whether
you’re interested in spending any more time together. Nothing more, nothing
less. Put aside the notion that you’re looking for a mate or a one-night stand
or someone to please your mom. You’re just dating so that you can get to
know somebody a bit and let them get to know you.
So what are the ironclad follow-these-steps-and-you’ll-never-fail, step-on-a-
crack-and-you’ll-break-your-mother’s-back rules of dating? They don’t exist.
There are some guidelines, suggestions, and observations, but this whole
experience is a bit free form since you’re unique and so is everyone you’ll
ever date. So this book is about helping you understand who you are, what
you want — some commonly held assumptions, traits, and perils that will
allow you to be exactly the person you are. That way, if you’re having fun and
your date is having fun, you’re going to want to do it again.
So why such sweaty palms if this is supposed to be fun? Men and women have
been getting together for thousands of years after all. No, it’s not because
you’re the nerd of the universe, and everybody else is way cool. It’s because
the way people date — their expectations and assumptions and goals — have
changed with the times.
Adam and Eve were the original blind date (and we know who fixed them up).
It’s been a lot rockier ever since (ever wonder who Cain and Abel dated?).
In the caves, dating was mostly who had the biggest club (no, not that club)
and could carry off the choice woman. I don’t think flowers and candy played
a very big part. A few eons passed, and we moved from caves and plains to
hamlets to villages to towns to cities, and our courting rituals evolved, but
still dating really wasn’t allowed. Marriages were arranged by families for
political and economic reasons. Not only did women have no say, but neither
did the men.

Today, not only do we get to pick who we want to marry (at least in this coun-
try), but we get to audition them, which brings us to dating. In its purest form,
dating is auditioning for mating (and auditioning means we may or may not get
the part). Not only has dating gotten complicated (women can ask guys out),
but mating has gotten really complicated as well. And then there’s romance,
truly the plague of the 21st century. Romance has made expectations com-
pletely unrealistic.
With dating, we’re talking individual style — you and your little quirks, which
are going to change over time and from person to person, at least a bit. You’re
going to be a slightly different soul depending on whether you’re going out with
somebody you met at a bus stop or your best friend’s little sister, or your mom’s
law partner’s nephew. So don’t go for somebody else’s style. If you’re deter-
mined to mimic your incredibly cool friend, adapt the moves to your style
and your partner. The key is to stay light on your feet, be willing to improvise,
and believe down to the bottom of your shapely toes that your style is the
one that’s right for you. (And if it hasn’t worked so well in the past, this book
can help you figure out why and what you need to do to fine-tune your style
so that you’re cookin’.)
Before you find yourself hyperventilating over the prospect of dating, remem-
ber that there is no single, right way to date or to ask somebody out. And there
is no such thing as a perfect experience that will make someone fall madly and
passionately in love with you. A date is a unicorn, an imaginary beast that is
unique in every situation. But not to worry: This book helps you get it all sorted
out so that you can feel like you know what you’re doing, have some sense of
direction and some idea of what your date is doing and thinking, and even have
some fun.
About This Book
Lots of books have been written about how to be the perfect date — how to
mold yourself into a package that no one of the opposite sex will be able to
resist. I want you to resist this notion strenuously. Think about it for a minute:
If you pretend to be a stud muffin or a Barbie doll or a pretty woman or a man
in black and that’s not the real you, and if your date likes what you’re pretend-
ing to be, you have to continue pretending endlessly or, when the real you
emerges, the deal is blown. Even if you decide to be your best possible self,
are you going to be able to maintain that posture endlessly? If not, when you
let yourself unwind you may find your date hurt, angry, and confused about
how you presented yourself initially and who you are now. The whole thing
about dating is maintainability.
I wrote this book to be about real-life dating:
2
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

 In this book, I tell you where to find members of the opposite sex, explain
the difference between good and bad pick-up lines, give you pointers on
what to wear and what to avoid, describe the perfect place to begin scout-
ing for the perfect date and the perfect date place, and offer a lot of other
information, including how much happier you’ll be if you don’t worry
about the “perfect” anything. After all, a little imperfection makes the
world go round.
 The time frame of this book spans from the time you decide you want
to date (or date smarter) until six to nine months after your first date,
which is the watershed period: the time when most daters either break
up, which means they go back to the beginning, or go on to couplehood.
That’s a fair amount of leeway, and it depends on lots of factors that I
discuss in the chapters that follow.
Dating stops when couplehood begins; relationships deal with commit-
ment and the M word (marriage) and cheating and money and parents
and babies and all that sort of stuff.
Remember: The nice thing about a date is that it’s just a date. It’s an opportu-
nity, a time, a place, and a situation for one person to get to know another
person. It’s not an invitation for sex or marriage or to meet Mom or to find
someone to produce a child with or to impress your friends or to get your
folks off your back or to prove that you’re not a loner. Dating is no big deal.
But it can feel really, really scary because it has to do with big-ticket items:
the opposite sex and rejection. Yikes! I don’t promise to take all the adrena-
line out of dating ’cause that would also remove the fun, but at least I can try
to smooth out some of the panic and show you why your palms are sweating
and the origin of those tummy butterflies so you can enjoy the ride.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps.
A word as to the use of the word “we”: By For Dummies convention, the word
“we” is seldom used. When I use the word “we,” I refer neither to me and my
tapeworm nor the imperial we, but you and me, kid. When it comes to dating,
all of us face the same problems; if I use the word you, it sounds like I don’t
include myself in the same misgivings, insecurities, and problems, and I do —
believe me, I do. Hence, the word “we.”

Introduction

What’s Not Required Reading
I’ve written this book so that you can 1) find information easily and 2) easily
understand what you find. And although I’d like to believe that you want to
pore over every last word between the two yellow and black covers, I actually
make it easy for you to identify “skippable” material. This information is the
stuff that, although interesting and related to the topic at hand, isn’t essential
for you to know. (That means no pop-quiz, but I did go to a lot of trouble to
write it, so I hope you read every word. If you don’t, okay — sniff, sniff —
whatever makes you happy.)
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here
and there. They share cool ideas, personal stories, and observations,
but aren’t critical.
 The stuff on the copyright page: No kidding. You’ll find nothing here
of interest unless you’re inexplicably enamored by legal language and
Library of Congress numbers. Even I have been known to by-pass this
stuff after being sure my name is spelled correctly.
Assumptions about You
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you:
 You are straight, that is, heterosexual: Statistically, most people are het-
erosexual, and my goal is to reach the widest audience. Also, many of the
issues between opposite-sex dating and same-sex dating are similar, and
most are identical. If you find something that I’ve overlooked, write and
tell me what works and what doesn’t for you at www.drjoy.com. You can
also see current pictures of me there, find out where and when to hear
or see me on the radio and television, get my take on current movies and
theatre, and see if I’ve written anything new that might interest you.
 You are above the age of consent: This book is a grown-up look at a
subject that involves us from childhood, so in reading it, remember that
when it comes to the sexual parts, I want you over the age of consent —
18, in most cases. Sex is for adult, responsible folk. If you’re a minor, read
the stuff about sex as something you’re going to do someday, but not now
(and when you do, take it seriously and respectfully); the rest of the stuff
should be pretty useful to you now.
 You are dating in the United States: Because dating customs vary widely
in different parts of the world, writing a book on dating worldwide is a
whole different project. As an anthropologist (yeah, I have degrees in just
about everything), I, too, am fascinated by cross-cultural stuff. This book
focuses on what I know best: U.S. dating customs. If you are not from the
4
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

United States, consider this book as a sort of insider’s guide to American
dating practices, a kind of roundabout way to see how dating in the United
States works.
 You are not a predator: You genuinely care about yourself as well as
others and getting to know another human being in an intimate and
meaningful way.
 You wish this book came in a plain brown wrapper: If anybody sees
you with it, you say you’re buying it for a friend or you heard my radio
program and bought it for a giggle. Even my daughter has been tempted
to disown me when a date sees my book in her bookcase.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized this book so that you can find information easily, whether you’re
using it like a reference or reading it front to back. I’ve divided it into eight
parts, each part containing chapters relevant to that specific topic. In addi-
tion, I’ve included two appendixes.
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I?
Any successful dating experience starts with you; that’s why the focus in Part I
is you — getting you ready to begin the glorious adventure of dating. In this
part, I give you pointers on being confident, even if confidence is the last
thing you feel; getting yourself ready to venture forth into the dating world;
and uncovering some of the less than helpful patterns you may have fallen
into so that you can be aware and active and can take more control of your
behavior. Also in this part, I help you figure out whether now is a good time
to begin dating or not.
If you’re new to dating, have been away from the dating scene for a while, or
aren’t happy with the way your dates have been turning out lately, this part is
where you want to begin. Even if you read only this part, you’ll still find tons
of good information about being a happier and emotionally healthier person.
Part II: Who Do I Want?
After you figure yourself out, the next item on the agenda is figuring out who
you want, where you can find them, and how you can make your approach so
that you two can get together. In Part II, I give you the lowdown on great places
to meet a potential date and pointers on how to approach Mr. or Ms. Intriguing
once you do find them.
5
Introduction

Making the initial approach is probably one of the toughest parts of meeting
someone new — will he like me? will she turn away? will I make a fool of myself?
I share tips on what works, what doesn’t work, and how you can maneuver
gracefully through the encounter, no matter how it turns out.
Part III: Setting Up the Date
You’ve met someone, you think you click, and now you’re at the next step:
setting up a date. In Part III, you can find surefire tips on how to ask for a date
so that you get the answer you want or, if the answer is no, so that you can
bow out gracefully, with your dignity intact; how to deal with the potentially
sticky situation of getting (or giving out) a phone number; and what to look
for in the place you pick for the date.
Part IV: Date Day Preparations
It’s date day. You’re probably feeling anxious, excited, hopeful, giddy, and a
little queasy. This part takes you through getting ready, from the outside to
the inside to the last-minute things you do. In this part, I give pointers on
everything from what to wear (and what not to wear) to the things you should
carry out the door with you to how you can relax and prepare yourself men-
tally for a great time.
In this part, I also give you the information you need to make it over the first,
generally awkward minutes of a first date: things like what to talk about (and
what to avoid), how to flirt, how to listen, and how to gauge how things are
going by being aware of body language.
Part V: The Date
In this part, you can find information dealing with just about every scenario
you may encounter on a first date. I cover how you can turn an ordinary date
into something extraordinary and how you can turn that great time into date
number two. I also give pointers on how to navigate through potentially embar-
rassing or awkward moments, how to end the date, how to deal with the kiss
questions (do you or don’t you and how can you tell whether your date wants
to, and even how to), and how to step back after it’s over and gain a sense of
perspective on the evening.
Since not all dates go wonderfully, I explain how to read the signs of a date
going south, and how to handle those not-so-great dates so that you come
out looking like the prince or princess you are.
6
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VI: The Day After and Beyond
Every date — good, bad, or indifferent — has a day after, and in this part, you
can find out how to handle the next day, the next date, and everything that
can potentially come after. I also list what things you need to share (and what
things you must keep quiet) if your date is turning into a relationship-to-be
and when you should share them. I explain the differences between casual,
serious, and heavy dating, and how sex can impact the budding relationship.
If your date has turned into a relationship and things don’t seem to be work-
ing out, I explain how to read the warning signs, what you can do to try to
save the relationship, and, when all else fails, how to break up without either
of you falling to pieces and how to move beyond the breakup. Finally, a real
danger when you’re feeling vulnerable after a breakup is rebound, so I spend
a whole chapter explaining what that is and why you must avoid it.
Part VII: Playing It Safe and 
Keeping It Fresh
This part covers how you can safeguard yourself from potentially dangerous
situations, from things as obvious as letting a friend know where you’re going
to less obvious things like paying attention to your intuition. Also, in this day
and age, when people meet online or through dating services or the person-
als, knowing how to protect yourself when your first date is the first time you
meet face to face is especially important. Unfortunately, a book on dating isn’t
complete without information about how you can protect yourself from the
slight but real risks of dating’s dark side: date rape and stalkers.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
This part contains lists of tens, including “Ten Ways to Know You’re in Love,”
“Ten Tips to Happy Dating,” and more. These lists give you good information
in quick, snappy bursts.
Appendixes
At the end of Part VIII, you find two appendixes. Appendix A gives information
specific to those situations (such as widowhood, significant age differences,
and so on) that make the dating experience a bit different. Appendix B helps
you translate common lines, like “Can’t we just be friends?” or “You’re too
good for me,” so that you can understand what is really being said.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
I include some symbols to make it easier to whiz through the book at the
speed of light or to peruse it at your leisure.
You find this icon beside neat things you may want to try.
This icon indicates information that is detrimental to you, your date, or your
dating experience.
This icon appears beside information that explains the biological reasons for
why things happen. Although you don’t technically need to know this stuff,
reading it can give you a lot of insight into why humans do what they do. In
the nature versus nurture debate, consider this icon the nature side.
Whenever the information relates primarily to women, I indicate it with this
icon. This doesn’t mean, however, that only women should read this material.
In fact, you guys can get quite a bit of insight into female behavior by paying
attention to this stuff.
If the information relates primarily to men, I use this icon. (Girls, if you want
to understand men a little better, take a peek at this stuff.)
Some things just aren’t good ideas: They’re dangerous, hurtful, harmful, and

Where to Go from Here
You can read this book from front to back or treat it like a reference and hop
around, reading only those sections that apply to you. If you don’t want to read
through the entire book, here is a brief guide on where you can find informa-
tion specific to your situation (you can also use the Table of Contents or the
Index to find specific topics):
If You Are
Read
Young (13 to 17)
Whole book, but ignore Chapter 22 about sex.
Inexperienced (that

have done no serious 
dating, have dated 
fewer than three 
people, or have had 
fewer than three dates)
Divorced
During the year you are waiting to resume dating (and no
dating until one full year has passed), read Part I care-
fully, especially Chapter 4 about figuring out who you are,
what you want, what went wrong, and waiting. Also read
Chapter 24 on rebound. (It’s also not a terrible idea to do
some work on self, with or without a therapist.)
Separated
Don’t even think about dating. Follow the same advice for
divorced (see the preceding), only more so, and memorize
Chapter 24 on rebound.
Unhappily married 
Chapter 22, Chapter 23 on breaking up, and Chapter 24
or involved
on rebound. And don’t even think about thinking about
dating yet. Work on your relationship; if it doesn’t work
out, you still have to wait a year after the divorce or final
breakup becomes final.
Widowed
If you’re widowed at least a year, follow the advice for
divorced (see earlier item). If you’re widowed less than a
year, put the book aside, hang out with friends in groups,
and look at the cover once a month, but no reading until
the first year anniversary.
Senior
If all you are is older and aren’t widowed or divorced or
separated, start from the beginning and just read faster.
When it comes to dating, everyone is in the same boat,
regardless of age, so enjoy and be willing to feel inept
and young and inexperienced all over again. Is that such
a bad thing? Maybe not.

Introduction

Remember, this is a reference book, not a bible. Write in the margins, under-
line passages, dog-ear pages, and put that cool contact paper on the front if
you want.
No panicking, no whining, and no comparing. Okay. Let’s go!

Part I
The Focus: Who
Am I?

In this part . . .
D
ating is the emotional apex of who you are at this
very moment in time. The way you feel, act, walk,
talk, sashay, flirt, or dish the dirt all play a part in attract-
ing or totally turning off the ideal date. So right out of the
gate, you’ve gotta get clear on who you are because if you
can’t figure out who you are, how are you going to figure
out who you want in life?
Listen up: You, and you alone, are the beginning of any
dating experience. In this part, we’re going to take a look at
your patterns, your tendencies, your needs, your desires,
your past boo-boos, and your future hopes. Especially
when we’re talking about dating, self-awareness brings
action and power and the potential for lots of fun — which
is what truly great dates are all about.

 Recording your dating life
W
hen the For Dummies folks called about a revision to my original
Dating For Dummies book, now several years old, I originally thought
that not all that much had changed about dating: Dating, after all, is still about
two people who are interested in one another and want to get together at a
specific time and place. It’s not like we’re talking rocket science here. Since
the original fix-up — you know, the one between Adam and Eve (who had the
advantage of the ultimate Matchmaker) — dating has evolved. With the familiar
United States version less than 100 years old, the guy is often (but not always)
the one who asks and pays, and couples still face the tension of possible sex at
the end of the evening. However, after some reflection about the dating scene
I concluded that the last six or seven years have indeed significantly altered
the dating landscape, and anything that alters that landscape is certainly going
to alter dating behavior.
In this chapter, I detail those changes precisely. In addition to key points to
remember about modern dating, you can learn how to keep track of what’s
going on in a dating notebook. I promise no pop quizzes, but you’ll be amazed
at how much you can learn about yourself and the process.
Scoping Out the Changing Dating World
Believe it or not, the changes that society, sexuality, entertainment, and 
technology have engendered in the dating scene can be distilled into a
single concept: the need for speed!

Speed bumps
Admittedly, human beings, when it comes to love, have always been 
impatient — even though Diana Ross, or at least her momma, said, “You can’t
hurry love, you just have to wait!” People are under more pressures now to
race dating at the speed of light when instead they should be taking very
small baby steps, exercising due diligence, and noticing in minute detail
what’s going on. I know that the temptation is to close your eyes and just go
for it. Falling makes it seem much more fun, scary, exciting, and fast, but it’s
not very productive if you’re looking for more than just cheap thrills.
I sort of invented speed dating, accidentally, when I first had a TV show in
2000. Speed dating, as it has evolved, usually gives participants six or seven
minutes with each potential date, but I gave them three minutes to convince
somebody to go out with them, though I was there to offer encouragement or
redirect the Burger King philosophy of life: Quick, hot, juicy, and your way
work in some places, just not in dating! The need for speed is triggered by
two equal and opposite tendencies: Ironically, couples are marrying earlier
(obvious sexual urgency) and later (increasing fertility concerns), with women
feeling that if they wait any longer they won’t have the option of raising chil-
dren of their own.
Changing definitions of marriage: 
When and why
Dating has changed, marriage is changing, gender roles are changing. There
are now more single people living by themselves than ever before in the his-
tory of the world. This tendency, coupled with the reality that life expectancy
has nearly doubled in the last century, means that individuals are concluding
that they can hold off on marriage or not marry at all, options that mean that
dating doesn’t necessarily point in the direction of settling down as it once did
and settling down could mean spending many decades with one person if they
marry early, prompting them to proceed cautiously.
Statistically, more people are marrying and remarrying than ever before:
Concerns about fertility are balanced by women deciding that they can have
children without the benefit of a partner, another factor that has radically
altered the dating landscape. Some people who are raising children are dating
but have never married and don’t intend to (see Appendix A for info about
dating if you’re a single parent).
If all this makes your head spin, you are not alone.

Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

Fantasies and realities
In addition to the census, demographic data, and the changing realities, televi-
sion shows in the 21st century have significantly changed the dating landscape
since popular notions perpetuated by the media, while originally fantasy, have
a strange habit of morphing into our shared reality. Dating shows have always
been a part of the TV landscape, but the bar has been raised, or lowered,
depending on how you look at it. In addition to the traditional plethora of inane
dating shows, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?, Who Wants to Marry My Dad?,
The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and My Big, Fat, Ugly Fiancé have not only made
dating a blood sport but convinced the viewing public that hot tubs and serial
necking in front of a TV camera are normal aspects of dating. Rules about no
kissing on the first date and no sex until the third date seem laughably out of
fashion if you watch television. Dating as a competitive sport — complete with
body contact and backbiting — has cheapened, degraded, and sexualized
dating as well as increased hostility in ways we’re not even completely aware of.
Okay, so most of us probably look at television dating shows and say, “That’s
ridiculous!” We know that a lot of editing and prompting goes on. But we are
all influenced, subtly and not so subtly, by these shows in how we date, how
we view the opposite sex, our own behavior, and what’s acceptable and what’s
not. Reality TV has made competition, mean spiritedness, and just plain nas-
tiness part of the social landscape between men and women, making the war
between the sexes appear as a bombed-out landscape with few survivors and
multiple casualties. Chapters 13 and 14 may make you believe in civilization,
manners, and survival as possible goals in dating for yourself and others.
Adding to the general confusion is the fact that so many television shows sug-
gest that being gay is not only acceptable but hip and nearly ubiquitous, which
has certainly increased the potential for at least considering yourself bisexual,
or even more terrifying, having your partner consider him or herself bisexual.
Thus dating has become a question of will or won’t your date come out of the
closet after you get to know each other. Interestingly enough, the statistics on
the percentage of the population reported and reporting as gay is unchanged
since Alfred Kinsey’s studies 60 years ago. Thirty years ago, TV would have you
believe no one was gay; today TV would allow you to assume everybody is gay.
Terrorism and war
The terror attacks of September 11 have also changed the social landscape
forever. The realization that life could be so dramatically fleeting and unpre-
dictable meant folks rethought relationships suddenly: broke up, or committed
to one another foregoing — perhaps forever — the sense that we all have all
15
Chapter 1: Thoroughly Modern Dating

the time in the world. Dating in this context has taken on a level of intensity
and urgency, with people often looking for instant meaning in an inappropriate
way — make my life meaningful, make me happy, make it all worthwhile — a
heavy burden indeed for a process that was invented to be light, delicate, and
lengthy. Modern dating has always worked best as a carefree, pleasant, expe-
rience, at least initially, but that evaporated after September 11. Questioning
whether coupledom or bringing children into this world was a good idea was
offset by the questioning of the willingness to be alone if the world was about to
end. The simple question of “Am I willing to spend the rest of my life with you?”
has been altered by the fear factor in general and by the threat of terrorism
on a daily basis. Intellectually, people may have understood that anybody
could perish at anytime, but September 11 drove home that point in a dra-
matic and tragic way.
Gadgets, gadgets everywhere!
Modern technology has had an impact on all aspects of our lives, including
dating.
Computers and the Internet
Instant coffee, fast food, and instant gratification have been a part of the
social landscape for years, but instant messaging, constant access through
cell phones, caller ID, and the Internet have made it all too easy to act impul-
sively and regret at leisure. Moving at the speed of light is sexy for sound
waves but scary for human relationships, especially when it comes to dating.
Online dating
Even when Internet dating was in its infancy, I understood the advantage and
disadvantages of the computer as cupid — in a word, dramatically increasing
the pool of potential dates, as well as offering options, which is never a bad
thing. It gives people an opportunity to “meet” people from different social
circles, creating the delightful sense that somebody wonderful is just around
the corner (as long as one is able to resist endless corner peering). Then as
now, it’s important to online date for a minimum amount of time before going
in-life. My basic rule of thumb is that you should have no more than a couple
of e-mail chats and phone calls over a couple of weeks before you meet some-
body face to face.
The last time I checked, literally millions of people are online dating. On a
more personal level, I know 12 couples who met online (not all of whom
have admitted to having allowed a computer to match make).
16
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

Here’s the good news and bad news about online dating (for more info on
online dating, see Chapters 6 and 29):
 The good news about online dating is that it does increase the number
of possibilities and can be morale boosting to see how many people are
around and available, plus it gives you an opportunity to shop.
 The bad news is that it can be impersonal, time consuming, and addic-
tive, with a large dollop of fantasy, and there’s a tendency to shop.
People tend not to be incredibly honest about who they are, what they’re
looking for, their weight, age, marital history, their past, their sex, whether
they’re straight or gay, because it is fantasy. Married people have been
known to pretend that they were single; gays, straight; older people, young;
young people, older. But if nothing else, it’ll give you the sense that there
are people out there.
Instant messaging
Instant messaging has become part of the Internet scene, enabling you to get
in touch with somebody immediately and talk in real time to them in a com-
pletely artificial while seemingly urgent way. Instant messaging discourages
self-censoring, voice clues, or reality-based feedback loop. If you’re angry with
one another (or even if you’re not), you may end up typing something that
you might not have said if you had a little longer to think it through. Although
you do get an instant response, it’s not the same as a conversation, so things
like tone, sense of humor, and irony really do get lost in typing. No matter
how you cut it, communicating through the Internet really is simply typing.
17
Chapter 1: Thoroughly Modern Dating
An inherent Internet temptation: 
Long-distance relationships
A lot of people are meeting up online with people
who live very far away. I’m not a fan of long-
distance relationships because they are more
fantasy than reality. In a long-distance relation-
ship, you spend so much more time anticipating
being together than you actually spend being
together. If you’re not careful, you’ll end up only
having sex when you’re together rather than
actually slowly, carefully, and organically getting
to know each other, which will result in increased
longing for one another when you’re apart, result-
ing in sexual liaisons when you’re together, on
and on and on.

Chat rooms
Chat rooms are another part of the fantasy world of the Internet. They’ve been
known to be very disruptive to relationships even when they’re not sugges-
tive or pornographic, and when they are, Nelly bar the door! And for those of
you who view Internet porn as harmless or private, beware! Because Internet
porn is so instantly available (it doesn’t even come in a wrapper anymore),
it’s right there in front of your keyboard. Women tend to be grievously offended
by it, and men tend to think, what’s the big deal? If Internet porn is part of your
life and you’re dating, you need to think through what you’re really doing
here, what your intent is, and what happens if you get caught. Remember
that very few things are private anymore.
Cell phones
To say cell phones have become ubiquitous doesn’t begin to explain how
common they are. My daughter visited Thailand and was astonished to dis-
cover that in a country where the average income is $700, everybody had
a cell phone!
With regard to dating, the first thing that you should know about a cell phone
is that unless you’re late for a date or lost and trying to get in touch with your
date by cell phone, turn it off! A date is not the time to show how popular you
are by letting your date know how many people call you. That’s why voice mail
was invented. The worst-case scenario I’ve ever seen was a couple walking
down the street and holding hands, while both of them were talking on their
cell phones, so you know they weren’t talking to each other. This kind of behav-
ior really makes no sense. Cell phone addiction is evidence of that need for
speed and urgency thing, always having to be in touch and feeling like you
might be missing something if you’re not connected. I actually once did a story
about countries where a person having sex is more likely to answer his or her
cell phone. If this is you, stop! Get up from the couch, go look in the mirror,
and ask yourself, “What are my priorities? When did I become so addicted to
being that in touch?”
Another problem with cell phones is that everything on your cell phone bill is
going to be listed by phone number. Anybody opening your cell phone bill is
going to know exactly who you’ve been taking too, what time of day, and for
how long. Star 69 and caller ID have also made both stalking and cheating some-
thing that you really can’t do with much success anymore. If you’re dating
more than one person and being less than candid with either, chances are
you’ll be busted by your trusty cell bill (see Chapter 9).
Use the disposability and portability of cells to your advantage by only giving
out your cell number (see Chapter 9) until you’ve had a number of face-to-face
dates and then only if you feel really secure.

Money matters
The days of men expecting or being expected to pay for everything have
come and gone. It makes a women look modern, generous, and interested to
at least offer and be willing to pick up the check, especially if she’s making a
decent living. Even if not, offer to do what you can even if it’s a picnic in the
park! Guys, offering to split the check makes you look cheap — I know she
looks generous, but you’ll be labeled chintzy. Times are changing — but not
overnight.
Sex
Ah sex, the fundamental things apply, except that we’re not quite so basic
anymore when you add in earlier puberty, longer lives, sexually transmitted
diseases, birth control, hooking up, women being more sexually aggressive
and assertive, drugs, and rock and roll. Relax, go at your own pace, always use
protection, and remind yourself to be respectful of your partner and yourself
since both of you are susceptible to — but not controlled by — hormones.
When in doubt, wait! Choice is complicating but eventually empowering!
Safety
I’ve mentioned this so many times before, but be reasonable and cautious.
Dating should be fun — not a walk on the wild side — so make sure you meet
a stranger in a public place, make sure someone knows where you are, and
use your cell phone initially — don’t give your home address or business
phone number or address until you know each other really well. Wait to have
sex until you feel safe enough to give out a home number. Use protection and
floss after meals.

Chapter 1: Thoroughly Modern Dating
You need two computers in your life
Dating is a social activity, while work is about
competence. Please don’t use your computer at
work to instant message, visit chat rooms, view
pornography, or check to see whether the dating
site has gotten much action. You need to have
at least two computers in your life: one at work
and one at home. If you don’t, you may find that
you’ll only have the one at home because you’re
going to get fired from the one at work.

Meeting Your Match in 
Today’s Dating Scene
Dating is the Wimbledon of social intercourse, so you’ll be happiest and most
successful if you practice, correct mistakes as you go along, and don’t expect
to make the finals the first time out. This should be fun and interesting. If it
feels grueling, unpleasant, or exhausting, take a breath and a break and kick
back for a while. You’re fine by yourself!
Keeping a Dating Notebook
Throughout this book, I include exercises you can do to find out more about
yourself and what you want, as well as suggestions for noting your feelings
and impressions. Treat this as both an opportunity and a project to find out
more about yourself.
Buy yourself a spiral notebook and a pen and write down specifics. (Be sure
to write in ink because it’s useful to go back and see what you were saying as
opposed to erasing it, if you didn’t like it, because your musings can be a work
in progress, a reflection of who you were and who you’re becoming.) Instead
of writing in this text (I still haven’t recovered from the fact that my second
grade teacher would never let me so much as underline in my book), I want
you to provide your own notebook, but keep it with Dating For Dummies, but
make sure no one else can casually pick it up and be privy to thoughts you
might want to keep a bit more private. When you write something down, include
information that will help you remember who you were at the time of notation,
your feelings, your job, your wishes and dreams as well as the date, the time
of day, who you were dating at the time, how old you were, and where you
were living. This info can really be an ongoing log (sort of like Captain Kirk
StarDate log as if your dating is entering a strange, new world, encountering
exotic new species!). (In spite of my teacher, if you bought this book, under-
line as you see fit unless you checked Dating For Dummies out of the library.
Hey, splurge and buy your own copy and keep it around for reference.)

Chapter 2
Being Confident
In This Chapter
 Getting over your fear
 Appearing confident
 Figuring out the difference between real confidence and false confidence
You have to start with confidence. Not bravado, not bluster. This book is
as much about losing your fear as anything else. If you want to be scared
silly of being rejected and feeling vulnerable, of being too fat or too tall or too
noisy or too quiet, you’re going to be alone, because I’ll tell you everybody’s
dirty little secret: If we let ourselves, we’d all be frightened all the time. It’s not
that there are brave people and cowards; it’s that there are people who decide
their fear is too heavy and can and should be left behind. These people get
on with their lives: They focus on other people, have fun, have sex, have pic-
nics, have colds, and even have doubts. But the emphasis is on doing, not on
worrying.
Handling Fear
The T-shirt that says No Fear is probably the only profound T-shirt in the his-
tory of the world.
Fear can paralyze you; it can stop you from looking for a job, looking for love,
looking in the mirror. It can keep you from asking for what you want, saying
what’s on your mind, saying “ouch” or “hurrah.” Fear eats away at your time,
your energy, your very self, and it has no place in your life. Caution? Perhaps.
Knowledge about why something isn’t good for you? Certainly. But fear is a
waste of time; most often, it is the boogeyman of your imagination, the mon-
ster that says, “Boo!”

Fear is an awesome and formidable power that scary things don’t deserve, so
turn on the lights and look at what you fear. Figure out what you can do to be
strong and bypass or tame what frightens you. Don’t let fear have the power
to control you. Take control of your fear.
What you already know is fine and comfortable and perhaps even useful, but
if you spend your whole life with the familiar, you miss out on a lot of poten-
tial pleasure. The only way to truly appreciate what you have is to measure it
against what else is available. You’re shopping in a one-room shack when a
whole mall awaits you. To paraphrase Auntie Mame, “Life is a banquet, and
most poor dummies are feeding on crumbs.”
I’m talking about blasting off and going bravely where you haven’t been before:
a land where you rule by laughing, singing, having fun, meeting new people,
encountering new situations, finding new muscles and a sense of perspective.
Okay, okay, I can hear you now: “Blastoff is scary. What if I get blown up on
the launch pad or end up where there’s no oxygen?”
Go for it. Lose your fear, and focus on your curiosity and strength. Think of
other new experiences you’ve had: your first day of school, the time you tried
a mango, your first airplane trip, the time you let your friend talk you into riding
the giant roller coaster, and so on. Admittedly, not all new experiences are
fun, but think of what you miss when you let your fear of the unknown keep
you from trying. You may miss things like lobster or chocolate or a Jacuzzi —
and a lot of exhilaration.
Even Captain Kirk, Spock, every astronaut, and every gorgeous creature and
manly stud has been fearful. The difference between being paralyzed and
going for it is a basic faith in yourself. This faith is really what confidence is
all about. Even when you’re not quite sure, the appearance of confidence can
get you a long way. In the long run, looking like you know what you’re doing
is almost as important as knowing what you’re doing. Almost.
22
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 
Whining
You know about whining — the obnoxious, nasal
complaining that serves no purpose other than to
say, “Pay attention to me because I’m helpless
and weak and irritating, and I can’t get your atten-
tion based on strength or knowledge or reason so
I’ll drive you crazy by pitching my voice and my
grievance in such a way that you’ll do anything to
have me stop, but you’ll hate both yourself and me
in the morning.” The word actually comes from
the Anglo-Saxon word for “whizzing” — which
must have meant something different to them
than to us — so obviously the concept of whin-
ing has been around for a very long time.
If you’ve got a legitimate complaint, say it clearly
and cogently and respectfully and see what you
can do to solve the problem. Leave whining to
3-year-olds who don’t want to take a bath.

Remember the musical The King and I (which is based, by the way, on a true
story)? Anna and her young son arrive in Siam, a strange foreign country in
which they know no one. While they’re awaiting the summons of the king,
who has a nasty reputation, Anna tells her son to whistle a happy tune to fool
everybody into thinking that they’re not afraid. This isn’t just a movie moment.
The truth is, if you pretend you’re not afraid, before you know it, you’re really
not afraid.
Be afraid of not taking chances, not making mistakes. Look both ways before
you cross the street, but don’t stand in the middle of the crosswalk and trem-
ble; you’ll get run over.
The Confidence Game
So let’s talk about this confidence thing. Are some people — the gorgeous,
smooth, and successful among us — born with it? Nope! These people got
to be successful and smooth by appearing to be confident. And what about
those who were smart enough to choose the right parents or get dipped in the
gorgeous-gene pool? Well, I know some of the most stunning people on this
earth, and most of them are surprisingly insecure and frightened — of losing
their looks, of appearing stupid and superficial, of growing old, of putting on
weight, of having no one love them for any reason other than their cheekbones,
of having no one love them at all.
23
Chapter 2: Being Confident
Take two lefts . . .
I’m one of those people who give instructions
like a girl. Where a guy would say take two lefts,
go a half mile, and take a hard right, I include
lots and lots of checkpoints: Go until you see the
red barn on the left, turn at the Dairy Queen sign
just before the house with the magnolia bush —
you get the picture. (Undoubtedly, this habit’s a
leftover from being the navigator when I was a
kid and not wanting to hurt my mom’s feelings
because she was hopeless with a map. If I
sounded like I wasn’t quite sure, then my being
right wouldn’t make my mom feel so incompe-
tent. Of course, I now realize that she was
delighted to be relieved of the task.)
I almost always know what I’m talking about, but
I never sound like it when I’m telling people how to
get somewhere. And they always seem surprised
when I’m right because my tone and demeanor
give exactly the wrong message. Even though I
know what I’m talking about, I don’t sound like it.
Fortunately, this equation works both ways. Just
as sounding tentative convinces people not to
take you seriously, sounding like you know what
you’re talking about convinces them that you’re
right. In other words, to a surprisingly large
extent, how people view us is up to us. Got it? 
Good.

I’m not suggesting that you petition to be hit upside the head with the ugly
stick, just that you get on with your life, whatever you look like. Accept the
ride home with the too-cute guy from your building who you never thought
would ask you out — rather than worry why he’d ask you out. Introduce
yourself to the fascinating woman you’d really like to know better. Or at least
say “hi” to the person you see daily at the bus stop. Smart people do the best
they can with what they’ve got, and they don’t whine too much in the process.
Confidence is the ability to trust yourself and convey that sense to others,
and appearance is half the battle. If you want to appear confident whether
you feel confident or not, try the following (for more information about confi-
dence and confidence building, see Chapter 3):
 Stand up straight. Posture counts. A straight spine denotes purpose and
strength (spineless means cowardly, after all). Face forward. Think mili-
tary bearing rather than bent-over hag from Snow White, and you’ll get
the picture.
 Smile. Not only is a smile a good umbrella to the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune, but it also convinces others you’re happy and healthy
and wise. A frown makes you look like you’re worried or frightened.
 Make eye contact. It’s all in the eyes. Showing that you’re not afraid to
look someone in the eye means that you’re strong and truthful and will-
ing to meet their scrutiny.
One of the most blatant tip-offs to a lie is the liar’s inability to make eye
contact — unless we’re talking pathological liar here, and then you’re
sunk anyway. Your momma knew that when she said, “Look me in the
eye and tell me you were studying.”
 Lean slightly forward. Whether you’re standing or sitting, leaning forward
rather than pulling back denotes energy and forthrightness — and that
signals strength and willingness. It also lets your energy move forward.
Leaning forward is a bit aggressive or at least assertive rather than
defensive or passive.
 Shake hands firmly (yeah, women, too). Upon entering a new situation,
walking confidently into someone else’s space and putting out your hand
and firmly — not crushingly nor limply — offering a part of yourself in a
friendly but assertive way says gobs and gobs of good things about you:
You’re unafraid, you’re an equal, you’re friendly, you’re engaging. A firm
handshake while you look someone in the eye works wonders in business
and personal situations.
It’s okay to feel nervous or excited, especially in new situations. An actor will
tell you that unless she feels that adrenaline rush, she’s not going to give a really
top-notch performance. Make those nerves work for you. Remind yourself:
I’ve felt this way before, and I survived; what’s the worst thing that could happen,
and how likely is that? It’s okay to feel a bit edgy. I can do this. Confidence is
both that quiet inner voice and that more obvious outer show.

Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

As I’m sure you’ve figured out, the woman who wears the flashy, low cut
dress and the man who brags about his conquests may be insecure and
trying to convince other folks of his or her appeal rather than trusting the
self. Anything you use to build confidence needs to go deeper and work for
you, not against you. You don’t want to send an easily misread or misinter-
preted signal. Doing something harmful to your basic sense of self doesn’t
make any sense. On the other hand, positive activities build real self-assurance.
When you whistle, for example, you hear yourself sounding happy, control
your breathing, and entertain others. Pretending to be interested may teach
you something; after all, you are listening. Pretending to be interesting makes
you more informed; how else would you be more fascinating? Get it?
Again, be sure that you’re not buying confidence through chemistry — alcohol
or other drugs — because it’s short-lived, unproductive, and dangerous. If you
don’t believe me, try being stone cold sober around a bunch of drunks.
So how do you learn to trust yourself? You can begin either on the inside or
the outside.
Confidence on the inside
When you begin building confidence on the inside, you inventory all the things
you do well, from tying your shoelace to helping your mom cross the street
to making a great cherry pie to sneezing really well.
Everybody does something well, and the place to begin building confidence is
on that sturdy foundation of being able to do something — anything — with a
degree of proficiency.
If you can’t think of one thing you do well, then you’re probably having a
pity party, which is toxic for confidence. You’re also not looking at yourself
objectively, so have a friend help you recognize your talents. If a friend’s not
available, ask your mother, who probably loves everything you do. If that doesn’t
work, immediately turn to Chapter 3 to understand why pity parties are toxic.
If that doesn’t work, see a therapist.

Chapter 2: Being Confident
Lights, camera, action
When I have a moment to prepare folks who are
doing TV with me for the first time, I always tell
them to sit forward in their chairs. Doing so puts
them right in the middle of things, ready to go
and participate. If they sit back, just moving far
enough forward to be heard takes energy, and
then their moment in the spotlight may be gone.

Confidence on the outside
To begin on the outside, you can develop a sense of personal style — knowing
what looks good on you, your own personal statement, the attention to detail
that sets you apart. Regardless of your age or economic circumstances or
bone structure, you can make a statement that makes you feel good about
yourself, and that is the best accessory you can have whether you’re looking
for a job or a loan or a date. A fun and easy way to develop a sense of per-
sonal style is to liven up your wardrobe with clothing and accessories that
accentuate the traits you like best.
If you’re not sure what becomes you, take a trusted friend to a dressing room
or have someone whose style you admire go with you (of course, don’t try to
copy someone else’s style, but if your friend has an eye for what looks good,
he or she can probably help you). Public dressing rooms are also great places
to ask strangers whether they think a style looks good on you. Strangers are
often brutally frank and even make suggestions. You can also ask a salesperson,
but be a little careful about trusting someone who’s working on commission.
The good ones are honest, but knowing which clerks to trust is hard if you
haven’t shopped much at a particular store.
If you’re feeling a bit scared about trying something new, shop at a resale or
discount store. These places often allow you to get more bang for your buck.
Don’t spend a fortune, but be willing to experiment a bit. You don’t have to do
anything drastic to find a new look. If your wardrobe consists of dark, sober
colors, try livening things up with a bright blouse or scarf or striped shirt or
tie; if your idea of casual wear is limited to jeans and concert T-shirts, consider
getting a pair of khakis and a shirt that can be worn with or without a tie. Look
through a magazine and see what look may work for you. Trust your mirror:
Which clothes do you already own that are most you-ish and most flattering?

Handshakes and other coded messages
I learned the importance of a firm handshake
when I was 16 years old and the only woman
working on an archeology dig in southern France.
I noticed that all the men strode up to one another
and firmly shook hands by a grasp and a single
downward movement and then went off to talk.
They would politely — but dismissively —
acknowledge me first, and then they would
shake hands with one another and be off.
The first time I used this handshake, I was being
a smart aleck. I just wanted to see what would
happen. What did happen was that their eyes
widened and then they included me in the con-
versation. I’ve practiced a firm handshake ever
since.

In general, wear something you like and know you look good in for a first date
instead of something very different from the real you or something brand
new that might pinch or fall apart or chafe. Your lucky dress or tie or color
is a better choice for a first date than that brand spanking new bolero jacket
you bought because you thought it looked good on Zorro or the Jacksons
(either Michael, Janet, or Andrew). Also, beware especially of new shoes.
They can literally cramp your style faster than anything I know. It’s hard to
stride confidently into a room if you have a gigantic blister on your heel or
your toes are folded back onto each other like an accordion. Clothes should
be comfortable. Wearing something that looks good but feels lousy (a too-
tight waistband or collar) is distracting and worrisome and unproductive.
How you conduct yourself has a big impact on how other people act around
you. Think about someone who’s really fun to be around. Usually that person
makes you comfortable because he or she is comfortable in his or her own
skin. Conversely, somebody who’s nervous and fidgety and needy makes you
break out in hives. Remember, people accept your version of yourself until
they know you better or have some reason not to. So put on that smile, shine
those shoes, remind yourself why your momma loves you, and keep in mind
that everybody’s nervous on a first date. If you can allow that nervousness
to be only a tiny layer of a nice, deep coat of confidence, both you and your
date can calm down and begin the hopefully enjoyable task of getting to know
each other.

Chapter 2: Being Confident
Square breathing
One of the ways to calm yourself when things
seem scary is to understand that our bodies are
machines that were designed when our brains
were smaller and our reflexes had to be quicker.
Our lives are testimony to those of our ancestors
who possessed quick reflexes; slower folk didn’t
live long enough to pass their genes along.
Breathing is the key to calmness. The fight or
flight response — our age-old response to real or
imagined threat — depends on delivering oxygen
quickly and efficiently to muscles that need to
be ready for action. During this adrenaline rush,
your heart rate increases, the passageways to
your lungs streamline, your blood vessels redirect
blood supply, and you begin to sweat. Real or
perceived danger (anxiety) throws the body into
overdrive, literally. Calming the breathing slows
everything down.
Ordinarily, we parallel breath, in and out. To enter
into a more relaxed state, practice square breath-
ing, which is inhaling to the count of four, holding
to the count of four, exhaling to the count of four,
and holding for four. With practice, you can
increase the intervals and slow things down even
more. Not only is square breathing good for con-
fidence building, but it’s also good for relaxation,
talking to the boss about a raise, preparing for a
speech, and — ta-da! — going out on a date.

Confidence builders
This section gives you some ideas about how you can go about building your
confidence. For more in-depth suggestions about building confidence and get-
ting ready to venture into the dating world, see Chapter 3.
 Catalog traits you like about yourself. Start with a pencil and paper and
write down the things you like best about yourself. Be specific: No sen-
tences like “I’m really a nice person” — what does that mean? It may mean
that you’re really good to animals, handle a calculator like you were born
with it in your hand, make a mean burrito for your friends, have a great
singing voice, or always clean your plate. So if you mean that you don’t
fly off the handle every time something goes wrong, write that. The more
specific the items, the better for confidence building.
 Help someone else. The ability to do something for someone else builds
confidence because not only does the person you help say thank you and
appreciate what you did for him, but he appreciates you in the process.
So if you feel your confidence is a bit too soggy for serious interaction
with the opposite sex, do someone a favor, find a volunteer activity, or
deal with kids (so you can feel more powerful). The other terrific advan-
tage of volunteer work is that you’re not locked in: You can feel good
quickly and not feel like you have to stay doing something forever.
Keeping some do-good stuff in your life is a way to be connected and keep
a balance in your life, as well as maintain good feelings about yourself and
the world at large.
 Try a challenging activity. Try doing something you didn’t think you
could do. Even if you don’t do a great job, you’ll feel much better about
yourself when you try something really difficult. Even succeeding at
something easy often doesn’t feel as good as attempting something
hard. And if you succeed at the hard stuff? Well, gangbusters!

Boogie-woogie, baby: 
Letting your confidence flow
When I first moved to a new city, I didn’t know a
soul. I was working out a lot to stay sane, and
unfortunately I stumbled into the gym where
Mikhail Baryshnikov and other folks from the
American Ballet Company worked out. There I
was among world-class dancers, so I took my
own advice, stayed in the back row, and com-
forted myself with the thought, “Maybe these
folks can twirl their left legs around their right
ears, but I have a Ph.D.” And I kept going. The
point is that confidence in one area allows us to
take chances in areas where we feel like a jerk.

It is actually okay to feel a sense of accomplishment by doing something
you know you can do. It’s a good start for confidence. Just as feelings of
incompetence seem to spread, so, too, can the more positive feelings.
So get out there and get started.
When you’re confident enough to date
Nobody feels sure about every part of his life, and all of us feel most insecure
about dealing with the opposite sex because we feel vulnerable and really
want things to go well. So don’t put off dating until you feel really, really sure
of yourself, because you’ll find that, by then, you’re 90 years old. Just try to
bolster your confidence enough so that you’re not whiny or so incredibly
needy that you’re falling apart (see Chapter 3 for tips on building confidence
and Chapter 5 to find out when is the right time to begin a dating relationship).
Sweaty palms and dry mouth and a bit of anxiety are okay.
You want to know how much anxiety is okay and how much is too much,
right? Not an unreasonable request since dating really can drain the confi-
dence banks. If you’re feeling really rocky on your feet, stabilize before
you venture forth. Don’t wait till everything is ducky, although ducky times
are the very best times to get yourself out there. Clinging to someone for
dear life isn’t sexy or stable enough to work for any length of time, and the
only people you’ll attract in times of trouble are control freaks who really
want and need to call all the shots. Also, don’t look for a parent figure or
someone as a crutch to lean on when you’re starting the dating game, or
you will find that dating is not at all fun and not a game but a desperate bid
for survival. Check out Chapter 32 for a list of times when you should not
try dating.

Chapter 2: Being Confident
Asking the right questions to find your true self
I was fortunate to be working on a TV project
with a stylist who really knew what she was
doing. She stood me in front of a mirror and
began a rundown:
“Look at these two colors. Which looks better?”
“Which is more flattering? Short sleeves or long?”
“Hair in front of your ears or behind?”
“What do these earrings say about you?”
“This scarf, this cut?”
When she was done, not only did I look pretty darn
good, but I had gained a sense of what my style
was and what it said about me, as opposed to
the unthinking patterns I had fallen into. Mirrors
don’t lie if you’re willing to take a look.

You’re ready to date if
 You’ve got a stable place to live and a way to make a living.
 You have a reasonably good working relationship with your parents
(okay, so long as you’re not at war; a cease fire is good enough).
 You have a friend or two hanging about.
 You know how to make yourself reasonably happy.
 You’d really like some tension and aggravation and excitement and fun
and worry and uncertainty in your life.
If you can answer yes to the preceding conditions, well, bunkie, sounds like
you’re ready. If you haven’t passed muster in any of the preceding, it’s time
to work on your life and put off dating temporarily. If nothing else, having
accomplished these things will give you a nearly giddy sense of confidence,
and that’s not only the name of this chapter, but the name of the game.
False Confidence
Just a word here about false confidence, the kind you purchase with alcohol
or some other chemical. Don’t do it. You can’t gain confidence through some
substance. It wears off, you get hung over, and it’s absolutely obvious in the
worst kind of way. You may think you appear confident, but everyone else
just thinks you’re drunk, high, a jerk, or all of the above. Think about how
uncool you notice some people to be when you’re the designated driver —
stone cold sober — and they’re three sheets to the wind. ’Nuff said.
When I’m talking confidence, I’m talking the real McCoy that comes from
knowing and trusting yourself, knowing that you’re not perfect but trusting
that you’ll do the best you can with what you’ve got.

The secret to sex appeal
Think of the sexiest person you know. My guess
is that if you take the person apart feature by fea-
ture, they may not be as good-looking as others
you know with more perfect features but less élan
(a cool French word for confidence, style, and
poise). In any country but ours, people think of
older women as incredibly sexy because they’ve
come into their own and accepted themselves.
Sex appeal is confidence, the ability not to ask
anything of another but a willingness to offer
yourself. What can be sexier?

D
ating is anxiety-provoking, exciting, common, and individualistic as well
as potentially straightforward and simple. The best way to have a good
time dating — not just on a date, but throughout the whole process — is to
be relatively sane and happy before you begin. Notice, I did not focus on any
particular date because you have surprisingly little control over that. After
all, there is another person involved and lots of imponderables. I don’t say
this to scare you, only to prepare you for what you already know in other sit-
uations: Life is full of surprises, and even with great preparation, things can
go wrong, and sometimes, with absolutely no preparation at all, things can go
astonishingly well.
The point is not to throw up your hands in frustration, but to realize you do the
best you can with what you’ve got and be prepared to go with the flow a bit,
which gets us back to my first point: your initial state of mind and welfare. The
happier you are, the more ready you are to date. (A contradiction you say? Nay,
nay. To figure out the right and wrong times for dating, see Chapters 5 and 32.)
If your life feels terrific, but you’d just love to have a special someone with
whom to share it — in other words, if your motivation is more focused whimsy
than desperate need — you’re prime dating material. Jump right to Parts II
and III, where you’ll find all sorts of tips and advice on making dates.
If you’re unutterably lonesome, desperate, miserable, or need cheering up,
this chapter is definitely for you. I’m gonna get you in shape to date. Just as
an athlete prepares for an important event or the opening of the season, I’m
going to coach you about how to prepare yourself to begin. Yep, that’s right,
this chapter deals with preparing to date, not actually dating. But don’t get
impatient. The mission of this chapter? Creating a person who is healthy and
happy and okay, maybe a little excited, but under control and ready to put in
the time to do the job right.

I’ve divided this chapter into terrific ideas and horrific ideas. These ideas are
each given a rating, that is, a heart (what else would you expect in a book on
dating?): the higher the heart count, the more important the idea and the
more critical to your dating health and preparedness. A broken heart is self-
explanatory: Don’t go there, even if you’re tempted, even if it seems logical;
the disaster is predictable.
The ideas are presented in sequential order. To get the most benefit from this
chapter, perform the suggestions in each section, in order. Begin with the
three-heart ideas, move to the two-heart ideas, and finish up with the one-
heart ideas. (Of course, avoid the broken heart ideas.) But even if you don’t
want to read this chapter from first page to last, you can still get a lot of good
information by jumping around.
hhhThree-Heart Ideas
These tasks are the most critical to your personal understanding and dating
well-being. They may seem like the hardest because they require that you get
out into the world and make connections with other people. That can be a
scary idea, especially if you’re unsure of yourself or shy or have been hurt or
just don’t know where to begin. But the benefits derived by getting yourself
out of the house and meeting new people are definitely worth it. No guts, no
glory — and, hey, this is dating, not dental extraction.
Taking yourself off house arrest
A wounded animal seeks shelter, but animals don’t have to date, just mate.
As far as we know, animals don’t have to worry about job descriptions, well-
meaning parents who nag, and a few extra pounds that don’t look terrific in
a bathing suit. Animals don’t get hurt by misunderstandings or insecurities,
animals don’t feel self pity, and they don’t have TV as an anesthetic. In other
words, animals don’t become couch potatoes because their true loves didn’t
come along. Although seeking shelter is fine if you’re a four-legged forest crea-
ture, if you’re a human, you need to get out and about. After all, we humans
are usually not very well-served by hibernating. We sulk and obsess and ana-
lyze and feel more and more cut off.
Therefore, bunkie, if you’re spending most of your time in front of the tube,
hoping the good fairy of dating will come and hit you upside the head with an
inspiration stick, you’re wasting time. Get off your butt, turn off the tube, and
get out of the house.
32
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

Sulking is not sexy, and it’s not productive. Your vocal cords will seize up if you
don’t use ’em, and your social skills will shrivel. When you’re feeling sorriest
for yourself is when you most need to use your gumption rather than wishing
you’d inherited straight teeth, a crooked smile, and a charm gene — and when
you most need to get out of the house. Take a walk, take a course, take a hike
(literally). The more sedentary you are, the less you feel like moving, and the
less you move, the less you feel like moving. Emotionally, you can experience
extreme sludgy-ness.
If you’re not working, get a job or do some volunteer activity. If you’re still in
school, join a club. The point is to get out of your cave and visit the rest of the
tribe. Doing so will change your perspective, clear up your skin, and keep you
from brooding and thinking only about yourself.
This isn’t a way to get a date; it’s a way to get a life. Even if you’ve broken
your leg, unless you want to be in a wheelchair the rest of your life, you’ve
got to move that leg and re-energize the muscles. True, it won’t be much fun
to begin with, but it’s the only way. Don’t put yourself in the prison of your
loneliness. Nobody but you has the key. Following are a few ideas you can use
to get yourself out of the house and meet new people:
 Make a plan to be out at least three days or nights a week — that’s less
than half the time — and to talk to at least three new people on each
outing. I’m not talking about picking somebody up; a simple “hi,” or a
conversation about garbanzo beans or the weather will do.
 Try going to new places, take a different route, or check out a new store.
Shake up your world a bit. What do you have to lose? Only your sadness.
 One of the best ways to make the transition from lonely to lovely is volun-
teer activities. Because you’re not getting paid, you feel more in control,
and because what you’re offering (basically yourself) is valuable to some-
one, volunteer work is a great way to build self-confidence.
33
Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self
Dealing with depression
If you feel incapable of moving off the couch; if
you’re not sleeping well or your eating habits
have changed; if you feel sad most of the time,
it’s hard to concentrate, and you’re noticing
your body doesn’t feel well, you may be
depressed. First get a physical to rule out any
treatable underlying condition.
If you get a clean bill of health and still feel really
lethargic, it’s time to make an appointment with a
psychiatrist. Depression is the most common and
untreated illness in our world, and that’s literally a
crying shame because it is a very treatable condi-
tion. Medication and talk therapy can change your
life and give you back the person you used to be.

A note here about online “relationships.” These relationships still count as
house arrest. Face-to-face is the way human beings relate best, and if you’re
using your PC for your social life, you’re literally keeping others at arm’s
(or at least keyboard’s) length. It’s not healthy or productive. If you’ve got
flesh-and-blood contacts and want to fill in some of the spaces between
seeing each other with online friendships, fine, but don’t substitute e-mail
for emotion or mistake online for alive.
When you get out of the house, you discover that you’re in charge and valuable.
You’re wanted and needed, and you’ll feel a lot more loving toward yourself,
which is the beginning of allowing other people to love you. Before love comes
like, and liking is what friends do for one another.
Making friends
Making friends is one of the most difficult and worthwhile experiences of human
life because it requires time and effort and patience and understanding and
acceptance and honesty. Many people confuse friendship with acquaintances,
and they’re not the same at all. Acquaintances are people you hang out with;
they’re convenient but interchangeable. Friends are people you actively seek
out, people with whom you have something in common, and the link is deeper
and stronger. It is very possible for one to become the other, and everyone
who becomes a friend had to be an acquaintance first. (Friendships can be
downgraded, for example, when two people move apart geographically or
emotionally or situationally — changing jobs, marital status, and so on. Of
course, this section focuses on getting friends, not losing them.)
If you’ve taken yourself off house arrest (see the preceding section “Taking
yourself off house arrest” for pointers), you’ve begun making acquaintances.
The question then is how to turn an acquaintance into a friend.
A friend indeed
The place to start is with an acquaintance that you really like, who seems to
have some time available, and with whom you have something in common.
Adult friendships are based on characteristics that you share or with which
you’re compatible, not overall similarities, so your friend to be may be older
or younger than you, taller or shorter, smarter or slower, richer or poorer, or
more or less energetic.
Beware of using the same criteria for adult friends that you used when you
were 12. Twelve-year-old girls’ minds meld: They essentially become one
person because they have everything in common: boys, parents, braces, new
breasts, bratty sibs, geometry, and zits. Also, 12-year-olds don’t have a fully
developed personality structure intact yet either; they are still a less solidi-
fied version of the person they will become: less rigid, less defined, less sure.
You will never again feel as close to another living soul (unless you happen to
be an identical twin). If you look for that same degree of intimacy, you’re going
to spend your whole life being disappointed for no good reason.
34
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

Are you friend material?
A friend can be an important part of your life, but not the totality of your life
as it was when you were a kid, so don’t try to take over your friend’s life or let
your friend take over yours. (Just because your best pal hates your hair-do,
thinks your career is in the dumps, or isn’t as fiscally adventurous doesn’t
mean you need to change hairdressers, go looking for another line of work, or
choose a different investment counselor.) If you’re old enough to date, you’re
old enough to be self-reliant, and the same characteristics that make a good
friend make a good potential date. Not to mention, our friends sustain us
while dates often come and go. Don’t be discouraged; just understand that
making friends is important whether or not your dating works immediately.
Who couldn’t use the practice in building and maintaining relationships?
Friends grab our heads as well as our hearts, and most of us have heads that
are a lot harder to fool than our hearts. Friendships employ less chemistry
and much more sense. Good friendships are also based on give and take, with-
out preordained roles of what one should do. You might expect your date to
pay for your meal, but you certainly wouldn’t expect a friend to; similarly,
you would never expect a friend to read your mind, even though you may
expect your date to (“If you loved me, you’d know”). A good friendship is
based on reality, not fantasy; equality, not dominance; and rationality, not
romance. The healthier both participants are, the better — and healthier —
the friendship will be.

Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self
Did you hear the one about . . . ?
This is a really silly joke, but I hope it will con-
vince you to take yourself off house arrest. A
guy was in a terrible accident, and he lost his eye.
Fortunately, he was a really talented wood carver,
so he undertook the task of making himself a new
eye from wood. Although his new eye looked
real, he was understandably self-conscious, so
he put himself on house arrest. Eventually, he
realized that this was not making him very
happy, so he worked out a plan where every day
he would take a few more steps outside. The
first day, he took one step, the second day, two,
and so on until after several months, he was at
the end of the street, where he saw a huge
banner proclaiming “Come one! Come all! Free
admission! Dance Tonite!”
Now he was still understandably self-conscious
about his eye, but he decided, no guts, no glory,
and went. He stood in the doorway and was just
about to lose his nerve, when he saw a woman
across the room, sitting by herself. She was
quite attractive except that she had the biggest
ears he had ever seen (I mean she made
Dumbo’s ears look small). He decided then and
there to ask her to dance, deciding that she
wasn’t perfect so he felt a bit safer.
With his heart in his throat, he threaded his way
among the dancers and said, “Care to dance?”
She smiled delightedly and said, “Would I!”
Stunned, he hollered back, “Big ears, big ears,
big ears.”
Well, I thought it was funny. I feel sure they will
get the whole thing worked out and enjoy the
dance and go on and live happily ever after. This
joke is also a cautionary tale: You might be a bit
self-conscious and overly sensitive at first, but
you should persevere.

36
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 
Adult friendship is based on caring about someone because of, rather than
in spite of, their warts, and the best way to have a friend is to be a friend.
You don’t have to be perfect to have a friend or be a friend. Just be flexible
and loving and honest. If you’re getting the idea that friendship is a great
potential basis for romance — bravo! — you’re right. The only tricky part
is chemistry.
Take out your dating notebook (see Chapter 1) and answer yes or no to the
following questions to find out whether you’re ready to be and have a friend-
ship with another adult. Keeping a notebook lets you see what you’re doing,
where you’ve been, and where you’re going. Haven’t started one yet? Not to
worry. You can buy a spiral notebook or a three-ring binder and start one now.
Make this exercise one of your entries.
 Expectations:
• Am I able to separate who I am and what I want from who my
friend is?
• Do I accept that my friend is not just like me?
 Tolerance:
• Am I as tolerant of my friend as I would like him/her to be tolerant
of me?
• Do I apply the same standards to myself that I expect of my friend
(in other words, do I have the same set of rules for myself and my
friend)?
 Availability:
• Am I willing to put myself out for my friend (that is, the relation-
ship isn’t all about convenience)?
• Do I have the time and energy to invest in being and having a friend?
Tell it like it is, sister
I had just moved to a new city and didn’t know
anyone. One of the news anchor women shared
a cab with me on the way home, and she said,
“I don’t have any really good women friends,
and you just moved here, and I’d really like to be
your friend.” I was touched by her honesty and
her urgency, and while we didn’t have a whole
lot in common, we did become friends because
her urgency really started the ball rolling.
Although it doesn’t always work, starting off
with an honest statement doesn’t hurt because
friendships have to be honest — not brutal —
just honest to qualify and to survive.

 Honesty:
• Am I willing to be my true self?
• Am I willing to say what I feel?
 Openness:
• Am I willing to be vulnerable and intimate and share my feelings?
 Dependency:
• Am I able to stand on my own?
 Empathy:
• Am I able to look at a conflict from someone else’s point of view?
 Perspective:
• Do I like something about my friend other than the fact that he/she

• Can I be a bit unselfish and less self-centered?
You can see from this list why friendship is such a good basis for dating and
just about any other kind of relationship. If you answered yes to most or all of
the questions, you’re great friend material. If you aren’t capable of friendship,
you might think about working on that before you take up dating. Friendship
isn’t easy. It is important, and it doesn’t even have sex to heat things up.
Friendship is truly a uniquely human and undeniably valuable exercise in
being our most basic and terrific and honest and self-reliant selves. Time
spent making friends is always time well spent. When you do launch your
dating self, you’ll have your friend to commiserate or share the joy.

Same- versus opposite-sex friends
Can a man and a woman be justfriends? Well, yes
and no. Most women say yes; most men say no. It
is certainly possible for friendship to blossom into
a sexual and romantic thing. (Why do you think
When Harry Met Sally is still such a popular video
rental, and Friends and Dawson’s Creek still rule
in cable reruns five days a week?) Often exes can
be friends after the sexual passion has gone and
some time has passed so that neither is confused
by kindness or emotional intimacy. Remembering
what was or what might have been is harder
than starting from ground zero, with no history.
The advantage of opposite-sex friendships is
that you can share dating tips and insights. This
is probably why so many women have gay male
friends: They can get the insight without the
hassle of wondering about sex with one another.

hhTwo-Heart Ideas
You’ve now performed the most fundamental things: gotten yourself out of
the house and begun the process of social interaction that isn’t sexually
based. Good on ya. But how, I can hear you asking, do you go from friends
and volunteer activities to dating? Well, stay tuned, I’m gonna tell you.
Charm practice
Charm is simply the practice of making someone know that you feel good about
them without embarrassing them or asking anything of them in return, and
it’s really, really seductive. It’s being a fancy maitre d’ at a French restaurant
without the tip — making someone feel that they are the most important
person in the world to you at that moment.
 Charm has to be sincere. Charm is its most potent when you believe
what you’re saying.
 Charm must include eye contact. If you’re good at eye contact and vocal
warmth, it’s almost impossible to lay it on too thick.
 Charm may include compliments. What to say is relatively easy: Figure out
what would feel the best to you if someone were making you feel good.
This technique doesn’t work 100 percent of the time, but it works more
often than not, and because you’re tuned in to the other person (a large
part of the charm experience), you’ll be able to adjust accordingly.
 Charm is done lightly and pleasantly.
 Charm isn’t sexual; it’s just warmth.
 The trick to charm is to be selfless: You’re not asking for anything here, not
even feedback. Charm is independent of response (well, almost indepen-
dent; all of us like to feel appreciated, but with charm, being appreciated
isn’t the point).
The difference between charm and flattery is that flattery has an agenda —
I’ll give you compliments so that you’ll give me what I want. Charm is a
way of being, rather than a tool to achieve something.
 Charm at its simplest just says, “You’re terrific; thank you for letting me
bask in your glow.” Who among us isn’t going to respond to that pitch?
Like most things, charm benefits from practice. So where do you start? Any
place. Practice on your mom, your cat, your neighbor, your dad, your boss,
your teacher, the cop on the corner, the 2-year-old next door. You will also be
amazed at how charming people will be in return, the smiles you will glean,
the fun you will have.
38
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

In short, charm is a butterfly’s touch on a flower petal, the breeze of a hum-
mingbird’s wing: The key is easy does it. Charm is fun and potentially a very
profitable tool in interpersonal relationships, and it’s crucial to dating. So
practice and enjoy.
Reading the personals
In the age of disco, the Cold War, and Johnny Carson, (a mere 30 years ago),
personal ads were considered sleazy, sexual, and sometimes perverted — a
backstairs way for people to manage what they were ashamed to admit to.
These days, personals — both online and offline — are one of the most common
and accepted ways for people to meet one another. By spending a couple of
hours reading through the dating ads in whatever newspaper or magazine
you normally read anyway or at popular dating Web sites such as Match.com,
eHarmony.com, or any of the specialized dating sites, you can get a really good
idea of who’s looking for what.
Are personal ads completely accurate? Can they be useful? Good questions.
If you believed everything that was written, you’d believe that all women are
raven-haired, svelte, emerald-eyed owners of their own antiques importing
businesses, and all men are handsome, chisel-chinned CEOs looking to settle
down with a wife and kids after taking long romantic walks on the beach on
their private islands.
If you’re already feeling outclassed, if you’re not skinny, or if you don’t own
your own business, not to worry. Having done some research on the person-
als, I can assure you that people are not necessarily very accurate in their

Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self
The birth of an exercise
I discovered this technique of writing personal
ads quite by accident in therapy with a young
woman who tearfully told me she kept picking
the wrong guys. I had her write an ad. She ini-
tially focused on what she wanted in a guy, and
we looked at that together. It turned out she was
looking for a daddy to take care of her, but then
she would get aggravated when he treated her
like a child. Bingo. This discovery short-circuited
months or maybe even years of therapy.
Then we turned to a description of herself,
which she hadn’t even included originally beyond
the physical description (you know, single white
female, 28, and so on). It was a very efficient
insight into what she felt her strengths and
weaknesses were. She focused on her generous
hips while completely overlooking her gorgeous
skin — although she did realize her eyes were
her best feature.

self-descriptions. (If you don’t believe me, just spend a little time in the
cookie aisle of your favorite grocery store, or — even better — think about
how you described yourself in your yearbook.) But that’s not the point of
this exercise.
What this exercise does is help you figure out how many people are looking to
connect, how they describe themselves, and what they’re looking for. If nothing
else, this exercise helps you realize that you’re not alone, that lots of seem-
ingly normal, happy, fun people are out there looking. Once you’re ready, you
can hop right on out there and answer — or even write — an ad if you wish.
The following section tells you how.
Writing a personal ad for practice or real
When writing a personal ad, you need to consider where you’re going to place
your ad. If writing it for a newspaper, keep in mind that you have to pay per
word, so being succinct is an advantage. If you are placing your ad online, you
don’t have to worry about a per-word charge. But no matter where you’re
advertising, writing a personal ad requires the same kind of discipline that
you would use so as not to break the bank — pithy and succinct beats wordy
and rambling every time. For more information on writing a personal ad, see
Chapters 6 and 29.
Stop sweating. This is an exercise to limber you up, not a performance piece.
You don’t have to send the ad anywhere, but writing a personal ad does a
bunch of cool things for you:
 Makes you admit that you’re really ready to start looking to date
 Allows you to be specific about the kind of person you’re looking for
 Forces you to look at who you are (and that’s really, really, important)
When you write your personal ad in your dating notebook (see Chapter 1),
think about the following:
 Who you are
 Your assets and your liabilities
 What your mom loves about you
 What your friends criticize
 Your favorite thing to do (no, don’t put that in the ad just yet, thank you
very much; I mean your favorite thing to do vertically, with your clothes
on . . . in public)
40
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

When you describe your perfect companion, try to get beyond the physical
description and age to the person’s soul and consider these qualities:
 What is the person like?
 What do the two of you enjoy together?
 What do you talk about when you’re alone?
Other things that you might think about are
 Sex (come on now, no giggling) — your sex and the preferred option for
your date to be (in other words, are you straight or gay?)
 Age range
 Race, if it’s an issue
 Educational background
 Work
 Geographic proximity (don’t start with long distance unless it’s preferred,
and then you need to think about why you opted for distance rather than
closeness)
 Height and weight
 Religion
 Smoking preference
You should also think about whether you’re looking for:
 Friendship and whatever else
 A mate
 A date
 A discreet nooner
 Commitment
 Kids
 Marriage
 A prom escort
 Permanence
These lists are only the beginning of sorting through who you are and what you
want, and writing a personal ad is a cool short cut. In writing your practice ad,
allow yourself to be honest and creative (not with the facts, with your thoughts)
41
Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self

and specific, as well as flexible. This exercise should be fun and really helpful.
You don’t need a book to tell you how to write the ad, just the ability to write
out who you are and what you want.
hOne-Heart Ideas
Now that you’ve gained some confidence, some outside activities, some sense
of who you are and what you want, it’s time to do it: Take a closer look at you
and who you are. The exercise of writing a personal ad should have gotten you
a lot closer to the basics than you were before. Now it’s time to begin looking
beneath the surface, but first, the surface.
Making a good first impression
First impressions count. What do you see when you take a good look? I don’t
mean Mom’s eyes and Dad’s hairline. I mean, if you just walked into a room,
what would you see if you were looking at yourself? What do you say about
yourself?
 Look at your clothes. Do you dress age-appropriately, like your grand-
parents, or like a 12-year-old? Does your wardrobe scream rich or sexy or
uptight or casual or poor or insecure, or I hope nobody will notice me?
 Look at your shoes. Are they shiny or worn, fashionable or comfortable?
Do they match? Are the laces tied or broken or mismatched?
 Look at your hair. Is it neat and becoming, stylish or simple? Are your
roots showing? Does your part start below your ear, or are you wearing
an obvious rug?
 Look at your face. Is your makeup subtle or heavy? What’s your best
feature? What about facial hair: Are you shaved?
 Look at your hands. Are your nails clean, polish unchipped?
 What’s your look? Is it preppy or sexy? Conservative or out there?
Business-like or fun?
Considering a mini-makeover
To change your look, you don’t have to spend a lot of money or win a makeover
on a talk show. You just have to be willing to see what you want to change
without a lot of self-loathing. You can change your
42
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

 Wardrobe
 Look
 Waistline
 Hairdo and/or hair color
 Attitude
This makeover isn’t about changing your nose, height, bone structure, or par-
ents. It’s changing the seat covers, not replacing the couch, or touching up
the paint job, not selling the car.
The wardrobe department
Presumably you’re smart enough to not wear the same thing to the office that
you’d wear to the beach, but if you look through your closet, you’ll see a lot
of consistency: your comfort clothes (you may need to jump-start this part of
your wardrobe a bit) and stuff that is more costume that you wear to make a
statement. It doesn’t matter what the statement is as long as you’re aware of
the statement and it squares with how and what and why you want to pre-
sent yourself.
You can start with your closet if you like, and get rid of all the stuff that 
doesn’t make you look and feel terrific. All of us have more clothing than we
need, so if something doesn’t look and feel wonderful, give it to a friend or
Goodwill, but get it out of your closet. If your shoes hurt your feet, get rid of
’em. Nothing makes a person look worse than when their feet hurt. That’s the
easy part.

Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self
Where, oh where, has all my hair gone?
I know guys worry a lot about hair and losing it,
but most women would prefer a cool bald guy
with nice manners who’s interested in them to
a dope with a gorgeous head of hair — which
gets us to the rug question. Should you or
shouldn’t you?
Toupees aren’t usually all that convincing, but if
you want to, go ahead. What you might want to
try is just being yourself and letting your hair, or
lack of it, be. Go au naturel on vacation, and see
if you don’t feel more relaxed and happy. A
shaved head is very hip right now and bespeaks
loads of confidence, which is what true sexi-
ness is all about.
What you shouldn’t do is take that one wisp of
hair and wrap it 12 times around your head. If a
wind comes up, you’re sunk, and even if it’s dead
calm, you’re going to be fiddling with it and pat-
ting it, and you’ll look distracted and unhappy.
And remember, women don’t care nearly as
much about hair as you think.

Mirror, mirror
Take a close-up look in the mirror. We’re not talking plastic surgery here, just
a look at hairstyle, hair color (yeah, guys, you too), facial hair (yeah, gals,
you too), and makeup.
 Hair: If you hate your hair, it’s probably because you haven’t come to
grips with what looks good on you with your particular style and tex-
ture. Look through a magazine and pick out a couple of styles you like
and then make sure that the people wearing the hair have your coloring
or kind of hair or features. In fact, rather than focus on hair-style first,
look for magazine models that look like you (more or less, remembering
that even those models don’t look like that in real life), and then see
what style they’re wearing.
Don’t assume that a cool hairstyle is going to cost a fortune. Find some-
body who knows and likes your kind of hair, and make sure that everybody
they do doesn’t look exactly the same. Also be willing to experiment a
bit: Remember, it’s only hair, and it grows back.
 Flattering colors: You don’t have to spend gobs of money getting your
colors done. Go to a large department store with good lighting (not fluo-
rescent), pick up the same shirt in a bunch of different colors, and see
which color looks best with your skin and eyes. Then decide which color
looks worst. Avoid the latter and focus on the former.
All of us grow up with notions of what we hate about our bodies, and we
unconsciously try to cover up even when the problem is gone or the
cover-up only emphasizes the problem. So it may help to have an astute
salesperson or a friend with a good eye stand you in front of a mirror and
show you what looks good and why, and show you what you should avoid
like the plague.
As long as you’re preparing to launch yourself, you might as well look
and feel your best.

Snow White and Rose Orange, 
a story of two sisters
Two-thirds of all women and one-third of all men
color their hair. I learned a lesson very early on
with two sisters, one of whom had gorgeous
white hair and the other of whom had bright
orange hair, which was obviously not any color
momma nature had invented. I thought they
were 20 years different in age. They were three
years apart. (Oh, please . . . of course Ms.
Prematurely Orange looked much younger!)
Lesson learned as far as I’m concerned.

 Makeup: Makeup is a strange and wonderful thing. Men all say they hate
it ’til they see us without it. What they hate (and what we hate, too) is
looking like someone who has just walked off stage or out of the circus.
Makeup can enhance what you’ve got and hide a bit of what you wish
you didn’t have, but in the same way that men who try and hide a bald
spot can end up showing it off, too much makeup can actually empha-
size the very things you were trying to hide.
Remember, your face is you. A good makeup person can show you how
to look your best rather than someone else’s not so good. Often depart-
ment stores will do your makeup for free (although they try to sell you
the products afterward). Pick out someone whose makeup looks good —
especially if she’s got your skin, hair, and eye coloring as well. But don’t
try to look like her. You just want to look like you, only better.
 Physical fitness: All this stuff — the hair, the colors, the makeup — is
the stuff someone else can do for you. A bit harder is the stuff you have
to do for yourself. You can’t change your bone structure or your eye
shape, but you can lose ten pounds if you’d feel better (joining a health
club or jogging also gets you out of the house, and physical exercise is
its own happy pill) or put on ten pounds.
If you can figure out something to do that makes you happier with yourself
physically — whether it’s gaining or losing weight, changing your hairstyle,
or buying high heels or cowboy boots or a Wonder Bra or Spandex swim
trunks — then do it.
After you deal with the easy, outside stuff, it’s time to dig a bit deeper.
Learning from past experiences
None of us sprang from the head of Zeus fully armored. We all have a past,
things that made us happy or unhappy as a child or a youngster, previous
experiences with people of the opposite sex, parents, teachers, employers,
next-door neighbors, crushes, loves, lovers, maybe even spouses. If you can
pinpoint something making you unhappy, you can begin working on it. If you
feel you are the problem — and have felt that way for more than a couple of
weeks — it’s time to think about getting some professional help. Therapy is
a very good investment in you, especially if you’re really, really unhappy
(then I definitely am not only suggesting it, but ordering it). For most of us,
getting out a pencil and paper is the first step to better mental health. Just
as you wouldn’t go out on a date with a raging virus, a runny nose, and a 
temperature, starting to date with an unhappy head doesn’t make much
sense either.
45
Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self

Because the focus here is dating, start with your earliest boy-girl stuff. Don’t
edit or prettify — just write ’em down as they occur to you.
 When you were younger, even in kindergarten, what characteristics were
you drawn to? Has your taste changed? (Okay, I know you’re not interested
in preschoolers; let’s get focused here.) Do you like high energy or quiet
types? People like you or your opposite? Athletes or scholars?
 What personality types draw you? What constellation of characteristics
attracts you? Warriors or scholars? Introverts or extroverts?
 Are you passive with the opposite sex or more aggressive? Do you like to
be in charge or told what to do?
 Do you make decisions easily or do you prefer that someone else take
the responsibility?
 Are you drawn to high or low energy, quiet or bubbly, shy or outgoing?
 If you had to make a list outlining a perfect date, what would head
up your list? Is sense of humor important, being well-read, talking, 
or listening?
 What have been the best parts of your interactions with the opposite sex?
 What goes right the most often, and yeah, what goes sour? The point here
isn’t to fix blame, but to understand what your patterns have been since
your first crush. You can’t control chemistry, but you can understand it
and try to compensate for it because you can control behavior, at least
your own.
 Are there situations in which you shine or fold?
 What makes you happy, anxious, ambitious?
 What challenges you?
Yeah, I know these are personal questions, but dating is pretty personal stuff,
and the more you know about yourself, the more confident you can be, the
better the presentation you can make of yourself, and the more successful
the experience will be for the both of you. So dig away.
46
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 
Looks good to me. . . .
Presumably one of the reasons we are so influ-
enced by what we see is that animals, when
mating, have to determine healthy characteris-
tics so that the line will survive. While survival is
still pretty basic, a cute nose or a full head of
hair is a lot less crucial to good breeding genes
and survival than it used to be (unless you’re a
wolf or a sheep or a saber-toothed tiger). Just
one more of those charming contradictions of
being human these days.

If you’re reading this book because you’ve never had a date, don’t worry.
You have patterns to discover with your friends, your crushes, your fan-
tasies. If you’re a veteran of the dating wars, the more reconnaissance the
better. Knowing yourself is the best possible preparation for getting to know
someone else.
Turning your fantasy self to reality
Fantasy is a terrific indicator of the difference between what we have and what
we want. In our fantasies, we can do and be anything, and understanding what
we really want allows a perspective on who we are and how we should proceed.
Don’t misunderstand me: Fantasies aren’t exclusively or even primarily about
sex. They’re just about what you want without hearing your mom or your
Sunday school teacher or your big brother saying no. Fantasies are just feel-
ings given form, and they are safe if understood.
In this exercise, you write down the words that best describe your fantasy self
and see how those words compare to who you are and what you’re feeling at
this moment. Figure out what matches up and what doesn’t, and then think
about what you can do to bring your fantasy self more in line with the real you.
Answering the following questions in your dating notebook (see Chapter 1) is
the place to start. Then you have to decide whether you want to do the work,
practice different behaviors, learn new skills, be more honest. Change isn’t
easy, but it can be very worthwhile to lighten up, become more informed,
become more assertive, tune more into others, be more (or less) aware of
yourself, and so on.
 Who you are:
• Who are you?
• Who would you like to be?
• How can you bring the two together?
 What you want:
• What do you want?
• What do you have?
• How would you go about making one into the other?
 How others respond to you:
• How do people respond to you?
• How do you wish they’d respond?
• What can you do to get the preferred response?
47
Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self

Are the fantasies just frustration, and what can you learn from frustration?
(Frustration is probably the only true trigger to learning because it’s bumping
up against something that doesn’t feel good, which makes you look for new
pathways.)
After you’ve taken a good look at your fantasies about yourself, imagine
what your fantasy partner is all about. Okay, okay, indulge yourself for a
minute (I mean with clothes on):
 How does this person act, talk, think, respond to you?
 Would you be happy with this person for any length of time?
 What could you offer in return?
 How would you attract this kind of person?
 What would this person be likely to want from you?
Don’t allow yourself to spend too long thinking about the purely physical.
All things being equal, we would all probably prefer attractive to unattractive,
but you’d be surprised how many people, both men and women, aren’t all
that turned on by in-your-face gorgeous. When it comes to physical beauty, it
is seldom that all things are equal. Pretend for a moment that you are blind,
and describe your perfect date. Interesting, yes. It’s quite possible that you
didn’t mention even one physical characteristic. Why do you think they say
48
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 
Fantasy and frustration
Fantasies offer us an insight into the discrepancy
between what we are and what we have and what
we want. I used to do a program where I would
ask people if they had only a year or a week or a
day to live, what would they do. Since none of us
know whether we have any more or less than that
amount of time, thinking about these things is a
good way to get a clearer take on what we want.
If you won the lottery, what would you do? If you
could do anything in your life, what would you do?
I often loan people my magic wand for a couple
of days (no more than a week or the magic goes
away). Now I’m offering it to you to borrow.
Instead of whining about what you don’t have,
set yourself free to figure out what you want.
Then you can settle down and do the work of
figuring out how to get it.
When things are going well, we’re foolish if we
don’t just enjoy; it’s when we hit a bump that it’s
time to figure out what to do differently. In that
way, frustration is really the doorway to fantasy
and a better way of doing things. Start with the
dream and then figure out how to make it
happen.

love is blind? It’s because sight is probably the least important sense we bring
to the table when our hearts get involved. (To find out how important first
impressions are, see Chapter 11.)
When you think about fantasies, think about both long- and short-term time
frames: your perfect lunch vs. your perfect vacation vs. your perfect home
vs. the school you’d like your unborn children to attend. What would you and
your fantasy date do on your first date, your second anniversary, your second
decade, your second grandchild?
HBroken-Heart Ideas
Sometimes the best way to understand conclusively how to do something is
to understand very specifically what not to do. All of us have committed at
least several of the no-nos listed here, but if you can minimize them, you’ll
save a lot of wear and tear on yourself and everybody else.
Comparing yourself to others
This is not about entering the Miss USA or Mr. World contest. This is about
comparing yourself to Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie or anybody you see on a
billboard or a magazine. Those photos have been retouched to a fare-thee-
well (trust me, I’ve met and interviewed bunches of these people). They’ve
been powdered, primped, airbrushed, oiled, and lit so their own moms
wouldn’t recognize ’em. Besides, if you read any of the fan magazines, you
know that beautiful people don’t have all that easy a time dating either. So
cut it out.
While you’re at it, don’t compare yourself to the homecoming court either,
male or female, or to your next-door neighbor or your older or younger sibs
or your parents’ wedding picture. You are who you are, and if you want to
do a little fine-tuning there, fine. (That’s not to say, of course, that you can’t
change and grow, and I’m not even against plastic surgery, but not before
your first date, please. Know yourself, like yourself, and work on yourself.)
But you’ll only make yourself miserable for no reason if you continue to com-
pare your own light to someone else’s bulb. You can choose to be either a
pale imitation of how someone else looks or a vibrant, one-of-a-kind you.
Guess which I suggest.

Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self

Throwing pity parties
You can see how viewing your life as a beauty contest is hopeless and self-
defeating and just a short step away from a pity party — you know, woe is me,
no one likes me or loves me, I can’t get a date, I’m doomed to spending the rest
of my life alone diapering cats, I think I’ll go eat worms. The self-loathing can
move from face and body (I’ve got a zit farm and a spare tire that any sports
utility vehicle would envy) to heart and soul (I’m not a worthwhile person) with
incredible speed. If you really feel you absolutely must throw a pity party, stay
in bed for a day, play sad music, feel incredibly sorry for yourself, and then cut
it out. It’s boring and no fun to be around and very counter-productive to dating.
Why would anyone want to spend time with you if you are so self-centered
and sad? . . . And if you’ve been saying the same thing to yourself — quick! —
think of three cool things about yourself. If you can’t, call a therapist now.
I’m not kidding. Pity parties you can decline; depression is another thing
completely. See the earlier sidebar “Dealing with depression” if you’re not
sure whether you’re just momentarily down on yourself or truly depressed.
Vowing never again
I have nothing against your taking a vow of chastity if you plan to enter a
life of service and quiet contemplation, but why then did you buy a book
about dating? This book is Dating For Dummies, not Dating For Those Headed
For the Priesthood or a Convent, so cut it out. Don’t disguise a pity party in
clerical robes. It’s okay to take a break from dating if you wish, but don’t kid
yourself as to the reasons. Deciding that you’ll never date again may be a
thinly veiled hatred of the opposite sex: Poor little you is just too fragile to
get mauled by “them.”
Hey, if you’ve got a leaky pipe and you call a plumber and she doesn’t fix it,
does that mean you just let your basement fill up? I think not. You call another
plumber. (All right, smart aleck, I can hear you saying, “Okay, I’ll fix it myself.”
Yeah, yeah, that’s the problem about analogies, not to say plumbing. What if I
made it an electrical problem?) The point is, no need to blame, just figure out
what’s going on.
Swearing off the opposite sex so that you can catch your breath or if you’ve
just come out of a tough situation is not only fine, but wise. But don’t confuse
this break with fear or hatred. You need to be aware of your feelings so that
you can use that big fancy cortex on top of all your other organs — including
your heart — to figure out what’s going on.

Beating yourself up
Beating yourself up is a waste of time and painful, and because you’re the
only person you are guaranteed to be with your whole life, why hurt your-
self? I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take stock when something has gone
really wrong (see Chapter 23). Who needs to walk into a propeller blade more

Instead of beating yourself up, why not ask yourself what you could do differ-
ently next time? Make sure your answer is very, very specific.

I’ve already told you not to blame yourself and not to blame the entire opposite
sex. Unfortunately, these days, I may need to remind you not to blame anybody
else either: not your parents or your first grade teacher or your baby-sitter.
If you think you’ve got a problem because of something that someone did or
didn’t do at an earlier time in your life, ask yourself whether there is anything
you could ask of that person now — other than an apology — that would help
you. (Styles of parenting change every ten years or so, which means everybody
gets caught. Most of our parents did the best they could with what they had,
and the rules keep changing.)
If you think your mental health and dating abilities would be helped if you
had a better relationship with your dad, get baseball tickets and invite him,
but don’t expect him to apologize for the person he is. He may not have been
the perfect dad, but you may not have been the perfect kid, either, so let it
go. Or find a therapist.
If talking to your mom about the things she told you about sex would help —
and if you can manage such a discussion without making her feel defensive or
guilty — go for it. If you can’t manage it without making her feel bad, you’ll
end up feeling awful, too. Then what have you accomplished?
Blame locks you in the past and makes someone right and someone wrong,
which means it’s likely that someone’s going to fight you if you’re blaming
them, or if you’re doing the “it’s all my fault” routine, you’re making yourself
unhappy. Who needs it? So go to a therapist or go to a ball game, but what-
ever you do, get on with it. Figure out what to do differently and let’s go.

Chapter 3: Polishing Your Social Self

Putting yourself under house arrest
If the first way to get on with this dating stuff is to get out there, don’t put
yourself in prison, even if it’s homey and comfortable to begin with. It is very
unlikely that someone is going to come up to your door and ask you for a date
(and even if they do, think about what you’d be wearing . . .). Don’t allow
yourself to fall into the La Brea Tar Pits in front of your TV. Get out and be
active — and that doesn’t mean finding a neighborhood bar as a substitute
home away from home either. Bars aren’t the best place to find anybody other
than lonely people drinking in the dark. Let’s make a deal: Avoid any place
with bars — they’re all a kind of lock-up and confining. Let yourself be free.
Whining
Whining is the vocal manifestation of house arrest, pity parties, blaming, and
comparing. It’s hard to listen to, will give you wrinkles, and is social suicide.
Nobody likes a whiner, which makes it so remarkable that all of us do it from
time to time. The worst of it is, the more we whine, the whinier we feel, so
make a big sign with a goblet inside a circle and put a slash through it. Get it?
No whine (or wine, as the case may be).
Occasionally whining is okay — that’s what friends and family are for — but
the amount of time you spend whining should certainly be no more than the
amount of time you’re willing to spend listening to someone else whine.

Chapter 4
Finding Out What Makes You Tick
In This Chapter
 Understanding how Mom and Dad affect your dating decisions
 Figuring out your dating patterns
 Taking a close look at who you are and what you want
 Finding a match
W
hether you’re going to build a house, a patio, a hot fudge sundae, or a
garden, you would never start a project without figuring out what you
hope to accomplish, what tools you have on hand and what tools you need,
how you’re going to proceed, and when you’re going to start. Same with a date.
One of the reasons dating seems so scary and so magical is that you focus on
the endpoint instead of breaking the process down to manageable (even baby)
steps. Not to worry. That’s exactly the point of this book, and believe it or not,
this chapter starts with the most important part of the equation: you.
You may think that you know how to date, but unless you’re viewing dating
as a process rather than a make-it-or-break-it one-time event, you’re missing
the point. Sure, the date itself is fun and exciting to think about, but important
things come before the date and important things come after. To date success-
fully, you have to think about the whole shebang. Thinking about only the
date itself is like thinking about a dinner party without working at the menu,
the ingredients, the preparation time, and the cost and then trying to put the
whole thing together so that the food looks terrific, tastes yummy, is all ready
at the same time, and is enough to feed everyone.
The crucial factor isn’t getting someone else to like you or to go out with you;
it’s making sure that you sorta like yourself. This isn’t a book about saying,
“I’m a great person, and everybody should love me,” because I have no idea
who you are. By the time you work through this section, you’ll have a much
better notion of your strengths and weaknesses. Although examining your
weaknesses may not sound like much fun, some things are better to know
than ignore. It’s that ignored stuff that makes you really anxious, because
only part of you can really ignore it anyway; the other part — abetted by the
slight feeling of unease, the quick flashes of anxiety, the scary dreams — is
whispering or shouting in your ear, “Listen up!”

Not to worry; we’re all products under construction anyway.
Starting with Mom and Dad
Okay, where to start? How about at the very beginning: parents? Who you are,
especially in relationships, is determined by watching your own personal Adam
and Eve, alias Mom and Dad. Even if you didn’t grow up with both, how each
parent acted and talked about the other — and how each related to you —
influences you.
How Mom and Dad can still ground you
The purpose of this exercise is neither to prove that there is a terrific set of
parents who would have sent you forth with all you needed nor to prove that
the parents you got have emotionally maimed you. The purpose is to show that
anything your parents did has some positive and some negative possibilities.
Once you understand the consequences of parental influence and behavior,
you can emphasize or compensate for them. Consider the following examples:
 If you felt your parents never had time for you, you’re probably self-reliant
but find it difficult to trust and are a bit brittle on the outside. What you
most want is someone to hug you and tell you that you’re great.
 If your parents were really lovey-dovey with each other, you may have
felt envious and excluded. As a result, you may look for a date who ignores
everybody and everything but you.
 If one or other of your parents doted on you — and I mean really doted —
you may feel an overwhelming need to perform or be perfect. A date who
asks what you were doing last night may make you feel claustrophobic,
as if you’re being monitored or graded again.
Once you know that, you can look for someone who isn’t like the parent, who
is self-sufficient, and who is not overly sentimental. Unfortunately, most of us
choose someone who’s like the parent who didn’t do whatever we wanted
them to do when we were kids, and — voilá! — because we pick the same
kind of person, they act in the same kind of way.
Escaping parental haunting
The solution to parental haunting is to figure out how your parents acted, figure
out what you wanted them to do differently, and determine how, logically, you
can fix it so that this pattern of behavior doesn’t control your dating behavior.
54
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

Because you’re doing an inventory here, keeping a notebook in which you can
jot down thoughts and impressions is a great idea (see Chapter 1). Make sure
your notebook isn’t left around for other folks to read; it’s personal and just
for you and your work.
1. Start with a heading called “Mom and Dad,” leaving a page for each,
and write down any thoughts that occur.
On Mom’s page, you might write, “Neat-freak, warm laugh, takes care
of the finances, whines,” and so on. On Dad’s page, you might write,
“Rarely home, drinks too much, loves fishing, gives good hugs.”
It’s a good idea to leave lots of space so you can let your mind roam.
2. Now go to a new set of pages, again one each for Mom and Dad, and
try to organize your thoughts into positive and negative.
For example, on Mom’s page, you might put her warm laugh and the fact
that she’s in charge of the finances on the positive side and “neat freak”
on the negative side. Of course, if you’re being honest, warm laugh might
be positive, but “doesn’t take me seriously” might be the downside of her
sense of humor. See if you can use your grown-up self to look at things
fairly.
3. Once you’ve got a good list going, begin to relate the items on your
list to dating behavior.
For example, a sense of humor may be important, but so, too, may be
someone who won’t laugh at you. Which is more important: having
someone who listens a lot or someone who talks a lot? Make sure that
the characteristics you want aren’t mutually exclusive. For instance,
on one hand you want a man who is really successful; on the other,
you want someone for whom you come first. Nope! Doesn’t happen
that way.

Chapter 4: Finding Out What Makes You Tick
Dr. Joy’s mini self-esteem quiz
Question: Self-esteem is created by:
a. Your parents when you’re young
b. Your parents all your life
c. Your brothers and sisters
d. Your aunts and uncles
e. Your teachers in school
f. Your friends
Answer: None of the above. Self-esteem is not
mom-esteem, or dad-esteem, or sib-esteem, or
friend-esteem; it’s self-esteem, and it’s created
by you.
While a loving home and joyous childhood make
loving yourself easier, you build self-esteem by
feeling pride in something you’ve done — an
accomplishment. So if your self-esteem is at a
low ebb, do something you value and you’ll build
it back up.

When you understand which of your feelings about the opposite sex are directly
related to Mom and Dad, you may be able, with your grown-up mind and paper
and pencil, to free yourself of some of the knee-jerk responses that all of us
have. Consider these examples:
 If your Dad always beat you at checkers, you may go for the kill in games,
taking all the fun out for both of you, or you may be unwilling to play at all.
Finding a game at which you can best your Dad might free you, but at
least understanding the cause and effect helps.
 If your Mom was a worrywart, you may feel great anxiety before you leave
the house. Your adult self can understand Mom’s fears and separate them
from your own.
Looking for Patterns
Since you’re old enough to read and think about dating, you have some pat-
terns to go on. Even if this is your very first dating experience, you’ve talked
to the opposite sex, fantasized, and interacted. In this section, you look at
those patterns (this is also good information to put in your dating notebook):
 Who you choose: Are you drawn to blondes, bullies, actors, athletes,
people who hold you too tight, or people who seem to disappear?
Are you talking down-to-earth or mysterious, bubbly or reserved, 
serious or silly?
 How you act: All of us act in characteristic ways, and once we understand
those ways, we can see our behavior and the effect it has. Understanding
this, we can then begin to see alternative ways of behaving — what to
do more of and what to change — before our emotional bruises become
permanent.
In your notebook, put down what works really well for you and what
bombs. Are you really a good listener, or are your jokes terrific? Do you
dance well or help everybody with homework? Can you remember your
first grade teacher’s name? Do you do well at Trivial Pursuit? Do animals
love you? Are you great at crossword puzzles?
 How you react: Where are your buttons? What makes you blow up —
what words or phrases or situations? We all have them, and they’re
often connected by a long, sturdy thread to our past. I hate being told
to shut up. “Keep quiet” is okay; “stop talking” is okay; but someone’s
saying “shut up” makes me see red and purple and black and blue.
Don’t get hung up on the belief that some people are just naturally good at
dating and some are awful; it’s basically not true, and even if it were, it has
nothing to do with you. The goal of this book is to help you figure out how to
build relationships in a way that makes some sense to you and is effective
and honest and sincere and fun.
56
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

Don’t assume that everything you can do, everybody else can do. It’s just not
true, and the beginning of any good relationship is the relationship you have
with yourself. Don’t be shy and don’t be overly critical or overly kind. Paper
and pencil can help you to focus on your strengths.
When you’re done, you’ll probably have a pretty detailed list of the most super
New Year’s resolutions of all time: how you’re going to polish, trim, highlight,
and embrace who you are and who you are cheerfully and enthusiastically
becoming. The more specific the list, the more obvious the path and the more
straightforward the task.
Who Am I?
All of us are the products of our gene pools (that’s why this chapter begins
with parents); our experiences (that’s why the preceding section looks at 
patterns and fantasies); and our choices, intellect, and emotions, which is
what this section looks at. By now, you’re beginning to understand that there
are no perfect people and no perfect characteristics. Almost anything can
have a plus and a minus. You can’t begin to work on emphasizing the good
stuff and downplaying the icky until you know exactly what and where each is.
So to work:
1. List the things you really love about yourself in your dating notebook,
and be very specific.
What you love about yourself is the basis of everything else, but for
heaven’s sake, don’t write, “I’m a really nice person.” What does nice
mean? Instead, write that you are patient with your little brother, impatient
with a check-out clerk, likely to snitch a candy bar if no one’s watching —
well, actually, that part goes in the next step; so carry on with the good
stuff, or if you can’t separate ’em, begin the “what I’m not crazy about”
list and come back to this one after you’ve purged yourself.
Make sure that this list is long enough to withstand the next task, which
is to list what you don’t like about yourself. If you can’t come up with at
least ten specific good things, you’re having a pity party or you need a
therapist, seriously. We are each responsible for fashioning ourselves as
likable by our own standards, at the very least. If you can get other folks
to agree, terrific; if not . . . well, we’re not talking crazy here.
2. Now complete the I’m-not-crazy-about-these-things-in-myself list.
Just bedrock — who you are and what you can change and what you’re
going to have to learn to live with yourself — goes here.
Some of the things you’re proudest of often have a downside. For exam-
ple, if you’re independent, you may not be as attuned to others’ feelings
as you would like. If you’re sensitive, you may be too dependent on others’
opinions.
57
Chapter 4: Finding Out What Makes You Tick

The point of this exercise is to emphasize the positive and either downplay
or obliterate the negative. The very act of thinking about yourself in this way,
being specific, and taking inventory is the first step toward taking responsibil-
ity and changing what you can and want to change about yourself. Then you
can begin to repattern your behavior: Snap that rubber band against your
wrist when you lose your temper or fine yourself when you gossip; focus on
your great posture and ability to put others at ease.
Describing an Ideal Match
Now that you know who you are, what would you like in a partner? I’m not
necessarily talking about the rest of your life — after all, you may very well
want different things in someone at one stage or another of your life — but it
makes no sense to date someone who loves kids and animals if you want a
lifestyle of travel and high adventure and risk with a partner. Similarly, if sex
is crucial in your life, dating someone who thinks sex is dirty is somewhat
counterproductive.
Look at a specific list of the characteristics that would balance your good and
bad points. For example, if you’re shy, would you be happier with someone
who is more outgoing or shy like yourself? There is no right or wrong answer
here, just good questions.
58
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 
Love, hate, ads, and dating
It’s amazing how most of us are much more able
to list the things we loathe about ourselves rather
than our assets. I’m convinced it’s because we
live in a capitalist society that creates a desire for
things we don’t really need by convincing us that
the way we look and smell and taste and live isn’t
really all that cool. If you can’t value yourself,
how and why should anyone else? Confidence
isn’t conceit. In fact, it’s the opposite. Conceit
says, “I’m better than you.” Confidence says,
“I’m good.” It isn’t competitive or comparative.
Think about what most ads promise: that if we
use this mouthwash or beer or drive this car,
then some hunky guy or gorgeous babe will love
us — which is why we all break out in a sweat
when it comes to the idea of dating. We’ve all
been convinced that whatever we are isn’t okay
and that somebody else is going to beat us out
(that old capitalistic urge to win so somebody
loses crops up).

Start with the fantasy list describing your ideal partner, and compare that list
to the list describing your characteristics. See if there is a fit, a match. Are you
looking for security or excitement, domesticity or adventure, stability or thrills?
Are you looking to balance who you are or find someone just like you?
Being the real you
Once you’re aware of who you are, you can begin working on how you’re you.
You can look at your body language, your wardrobe, your vocabulary, your
tone of voice, your fears, and your desires and make sure that there is some
consistency between what you truly want and what your behavior indicates
you want. It’s amazing how often we all give out the wrong clues in an attempt
to pretend to be someone we’re not. When you’re more knowledgeable about
yourself, you can hold a mirror up to your behavior and see what others see —
and respond to. Think about how you present yourself and determine whether
you send out signals that are consistent with what you want.
59
Chapter 4: Finding Out What Makes You Tick
Friendly and not-so-friendly ghosts
When you begin thinking about who you want in
your life, the kind of person who makes sense, you
may be influenced by a ghost — not Casper and
not necessarily friendly, but someone who haunts
you without your even being aware of it. This
ghost is someone who rearranged the emotional
furniture in your room and is likely to be someone
who you cared about but who didn’t turn out as
you wished. It may be a first grade teacher who
seemed to like your best friend best, a best friend
who moved away, or someone who didn’t give you
a Valentine. It could also be a traumatic experi-
ence, like overhearing a remark from a supposed
friend that hurt your feelings. And just like ghosts,
who are assumed to be souls who haven’t found
peace, your emotional ghosts are fueled by lack
of resolution in your head or heart.
Because this chapter is about laying the
groundwork to go and do something that’s scary
and fun and exciting (that is, date), it’s a great
idea to have as much of your energy at your dis-
posal as possible. Therefore, an exorcism is in
order. You don’t need holy water, incense, or a
priest, just a bit of courage and a paper and
pencil. If you’re haunted by an emotional ghost
(what an image!), write down the specific char-
acteristics of the ghost — turn on the light of
your intellect and understanding. Ghosts need
darkness, fear, and tension to survive. You may
not be able to get rid of all the thoughts, but you
can probably keep yourself from being haunted
by just getting all those thoughts out into the
open and into your notebook. Ghosts can only
haunt you in the dark, so turn the light on.

Are you timid and looking at the floor or confident and covering up sweaty
palms with a bit of swagger? Are you noisy because you’re fearful no one will
listen to you, or do you whisper so that people have to stand close because
you’re afraid of your own power? Do you stoop to appear short or fluff your
hair to appear bigger?
A personal ad with no purse 
strings attached
In Chapter 3, I talk about writing a real personal ad. Here I want you to use
the gimmick simply to get in touch with you. The major distinction between
a real personal ad and this exercise is that real ads are limited in number of
words and just focus on the tip of the iceberg. Without these restrictions, you
can look well below the H2O level.
One of the quickest ways to make sure that what you’re advertising for and
what you want are the same is to write a personal ad that is just for fun and
practice and that will, most likely, never see the light of day. A personal ad
can tell you very quickly whether what you want and how you’re advertising
are out of whack. If you’re looking for someone with whom to settle down, for
example, then looks should be less important to you than stability, sincerity,
and fertility. If you love to travel, you shouldn’t be trolling for a homebody.
To use your personal ad for this exercise, look at what you said you wanted
in your mate (your fantasy) and what you said about yourself (your reality).
Look for compatible or complementary traits. For example, if you listed that
you want stability and commitment in your About Me section but listed
adventurous risk-taker in the About Him/Her section of the ad, you’ve got
some work to do in order to achieve some semblance of compatibility.
In determining whether the lists are compatible, look for overlap in words
or ideas. If you see “fun-loving” in your list, you probably want to see 
“fun-loving” — or a concept like it — in the fantasy date’s list, too; be care-
ful if your fantasy date’s list includes qualities that conflict with yours, like
“down-to-earth and serious.” You’ll think of them as a stick-in-the-mud, and
they’ll see you as frivolous, flirtatious, and untrustworthy.
You may be saying to yourself, “Hey look, I’m only talking about a date.” But
don’t go off in a direction that makes no sense (why date someone of another
faith if you would never allow yourself to fall in love with that person or marry
out of the faith? Why date someone who smokes if you hate smoking?) unless
you simply want a diversion, which is expensive in terms of time and energy
and emotion. Of course, if you want to do that, it’s fine with me. Just make
sure that you make your intentions clear upfront to all parties concerned,
including yourself.
60
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

If you’re not sure what you want, it’s okay to experiment, but make sure that
your uncertainty isn’t based on an unwillingness to face up to who you are
and what you want. That’s an expense none of us can afford.
Because this ad isn’t going anyplace, don’t worry about how many words you
use, but do make sure that you’re not avoiding reality by tap-dancing with a
lot of words. Are you looking for romance or companionship or commitment?
Don’t tell me all of the above, because they’re really not the same thing.
If your ad sounds like every ad that you’ve ever read, start again. This is you.
The real you, the honest you, the specific you. No one ever has to see what
you really want, but doing this exercise can focus you in a very helpful way.
What you’re looking for in your personal ad is something that really says you.
The fact that you love grape jelly and Bob Dylan and are allergic to cats says
a lot more than that you like moonlight and long romantic walks on a beach.
Puhl-leeeeze. If there was ever a time not to be trite, it’s when you’re talking
about yourself and who you are and what you want.
Don’t worry that you’re being too specific. If your ad seems too picky, you
can always modify it and try that approach for a while or rely on the Fates
and chemistry to steer you. Keep in mind, though, that a little bit of that
unwillingness to take responsibility goes a long way. So do be careful.

Chapter 4: Finding Out What Makes You Tick
Mixed messages and other near disasters
A close friend of mine wants nothing more than
to be married and have a vine-covered cottage
and a collie and a station wagon and a bunch of
kids. Even these days, she’s a throwback to the
1950s. Unfortunately, she presents herself by
going to bars in tight, low-cut dresses, and she
attracts guys who respond to her overt sexual-
ity. She scares off the very kind of guy that she
would really like, who probably wouldn’t be in a
bar in the first place, would be terrified by her
sexual aggressiveness, and would be unwilling
to fight through the guys drooling over her
cleavage. She is convinced that men are no
damn good and just users, which certainly isn’t
true of all men. It’s just that how she is presenting
herself and who she really is don’t have much
of an overlap. This is a woman who hasn’t done
her inventory of what she likes about herself
(not what others notice) and what she is look-
ing for. This is an extreme example, but it’s
extraordinary how often all the rest of us do a
variation on the same theme.
I also knew a guy who used to date gorgeous, tall,
blonde women, saying he was looking for great
breeding material. Understandably, many of these
gorgeous women were not all that thrilled about
settling down and having gobs of kids anytime
soon. They tended to treat him badly and leave
him after getting what they wanted from him. He
decided all women were leeches. Again, not
really the case. It’s just that what he wanted
deep down and the women he was choosing
had nothing in common. When he finally showed
up with a short, less-than-gorgeous woman
who adored him, I knew he was in love.

Do not be tempted to send this ad anywhere. Personal ads can certainly jazz
up your social life, but don’t waste the time or the money on a personal ad
until you have a bit of conventional dating under your belt. You want to make
sure that you have most of the details worked out before you take the act on
the road.
Tuck the ad away in your notebook for a while and go on to the next chapter.
If, after dating for a year or so, you feel like you know what you’re doing but
would like to widen the dating pool, you’ll be prepared. Do read the ad again
to make sure that everything is accurate in terms of how you see yourself and
your prospective date. (Of course, it certainly should have changed a bit once
you’ve been out there — nothing’s quite as valuable as a bit of experience.)
You’re now most of the way through armchair dating. Just a bit more and you
can get out there and strut your stuff.

The hairdresser, the psychic, and the cue ball
When I had just moved to San Francisco, I
noticed that my first hairdresser was wearing a
hunk of an engagement ring. I was suitably
wowed and said so, to which she said she was
getting married the following week. She was no
spring chicken and explained that she’d been
about to give up on men; then she’d gone to a
psychic who told her to write down everything
she wanted in a man. She’d written that she
wanted someone who was intelligent and kind,
who had a sense of humor, and who already had
kids and was ready to settle down. Three days
later, she’d met the guy she was about to marry
(don’t panic, they’d known each other for almost
two years). She laughingly noted that next time
she was going to put “full head of hair” on her
list because he was as bald as a billiard ball.
It wasn’t the psychic who did it, but the speci-
ficity of the hairdresser’s list — or more likely,
her being aware of what was important to her
and what wasn’t. She no longer allowed herself
to be diverted by the irrelevant, like a full head
of hair.

Chapter 5
Making Sure You’re Ready
In This Chapter
 Knowing when to avoid involvement
 Figuring out when to take the plunge
T
iming is crucial in many things in life, and dating is certainly no exception.
Finding the right person at the right time increases the probability of a
cool experience. Finding the right person at the wrong time is going to be a
problem. And finding the wrong person at the wrong time? — well, heaven
help us all.
For the wrong person, there is no right time. Trust me on this.
So how do you know when it’s the right time for you, the right time to launch
yourself into someone else’s orbit and try to convince that person to ride
your trajectory (and no, I’m not talking dirty)? As is true of much in life, not
only can understanding the wrong time give you insight into what to avoid
and the warning signs, but it can also help you tell when the right time is just
about to arrive so that you can be ready.
The Wrong Time
The wrong time is any time when you’re feeling blue and lonely and sad and
sorry for yourself — which is, of course, the time when all of us decide, “Okay,
I need to find someone.” You may be particularly susceptible to this type of
thinking when your boyfriend just dumped you, your girlfriend told you she
just wants to be friends, you’ve just moved to a new city and are lonely, or any
other time when attaching yourself to someone else sounds easier than being
alone. (See Chapter 32 for a list of the ten worst times to begin a relationship.)
I know the songs all talk about “I want you, I need you, I love you,” but need
means dependency, and if that’s how you set things up, you’ll distort any
potential future you could have with someone. Either you will be nurtured
(and thus less needy) and the whole reason for being together evaporates, or
you’ll continue to be needy. What a drag — literally! Need is a lousy basis for
anything other than employing a nurse; need won’t hold up for any length of

time, and breaking up is always the pits. So pull yourself together and get
yourself better before you even think about hooking up with someone else.
When you’re needy,
 Your feelings are so clouded by your pain that you can’t make sound
choices regarding what you want.
 You ask another person to make you okay.
 You can’t see objectively what the other person is able or willing to give.
 Dating leaves you in a worse situation than you were in before.
 You can camouflage or ignore growth areas (for a while) that need and
require your concentration.
When this relationship ends (which it’s bound to do), not only will you not be
better off, but you’ll actually be worse off because you’ll have all your original
issues to deal with in addition to anything that came up in this last relationship.
If depression and anxiety were attractive and neediness were sexy, it would
be okay to whine on a date, and everybody would fall madly in love. But you
know that’s not the way the world works. Believe me when I say that the need
to find another is the world’s worst reason to try to find another.
Following are some especially bad times:
 The death of a parent, a dog, your best friend, or anybody you feel
close to. The human psyche needs to reaffirm its mastery over death, so
the impulse not to be alone and sometimes even to mate can be really
strong when you’re feeling bereft. Unfortunately, another person can’t
act as a human bandage. You need to be able to embrace the sorrow of
loss and let it go before you can resume your normal life. Not only can
beginning a dating experience with someone before you’ve healed mess up
a potentially good situation, but it can slow the healing process as well.
 You’ve just lost your job. First things first. You need to find another job,
not a date. Because both a new date and a new job take time to find and
time to get used to, stabilize before you add a complication. Because
you won’t starve without a date and you may starve without a job, get
the job first. Additionally, getting fired feels lousy, and finding a job feels
good. You want to feel stable and healthy, not like somebody’s charity
case, before you begin dating.
 The loss of a place to live. This may seem like a really good excuse to latch
onto somebody who has a place to live and a bed and a stable existence,
but that n word (need, for those of you not paying attention) has to be a
tip-off. Need is not good to put on another soul. I want you. Yes! I love you.
Yes! I need you. No, no, no! If you don’t have a place to live, you don’t have
a place to take a date, a place to sleep, a place to get phone calls at night —
all that’s pretty basic. So take care of the basics and then go for it.

Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 

 You’re depressed. There are times when all of us feel lost and alone and
out of tune with the Universe. The priority at that moment is to get back
in tune, not to find a human teddy bear to keep the monsters at bay. Being
depressed doesn’t mean you’re hopeless; it just means that dating is going
to tax resources that are stretched pretty thin already.
If you’ve been feeling really sad and bummed for more than a week or two;
if you can’t eat, sleep, or concentrate; if you cry easily and feel hopeless
and tired all the time; and if things that used to make you happy really
don’t anymore, the cure isn’t a date — it’s a therapist and medication. No
kidding. Those are signs of a serious, but very treatable, illness. However,
the prescription isn’t a hug; it’s some important work so you won’t feel
like that again.
 You’ve just broken up with someone. There is a piece of folk wisdom
that says if you’ve just been thrown from a horse, the best cure is to
get right back on. That may work really well with horses, but don’t even
think about applying it to dating situations. If you’ve just broken up with
someone, don’t use another person as proof that you’re still lovable.
It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the human aspirin you’re using to
make your headache go away, at least temporarily.
Think of going to your bank and trying to borrow money. If you go in looking all
raggedy and dirty and seedy, do you think the bank is going to loan you money?
No way. If there isn’t some indication that you’ll be able to pay back the loan,
the loan officer may feel sorry for you but won’t loan you money. Relationships
are based on surprisingly similar theories. Somebody looking to get involved
with you expects to give but also to get something back, and expects you to
show a little interest (pardon the rather obvious pun). If you’re getting the
idea that misery is not a very good motivation to date, you’re exactly right.
The Right Time
The best time to begin dating is when your life is really in gear, your friends
think you’re swell, you’re relatively content with the way you look, work is
going well, you’re even on speaking terms with your parents, and you can think
of exes without raising your blood pressure. Hey, you’re ready. If you’re so all-
fired happy, why go through the hassle of dating, you ask. Good question, I
respond. Because, let’s face it: The right person can make a good day great and
a great day simply fabulous, and there is something about that chemistry thing.
Following are some scenarios that may motivate you — happy, well-adjusted
person that you are — to jump into the dating arena:
 Your friends are involved. Often the trigger to get you going is that all
your friends are involved, and they seem really happy. Equally important,
they also don’t have a whole lot of time for you these days, or at least not
as much free time as you find yourself with — good motivating factor.
65
Chapter 5: Making Sure You’re Ready

 You’re feeling great. Feeling much better about your life than you have
for a long, long time — cheerfully assuming you’re stone cold sober and
not high when you notice the feeling — is also a great time to begin.
Remember, it’s always easiest to borrow money when you seem to not
really need it, and the same is true with relationships. You’re your coolest
self when you’re happy and relaxed. If you could bottle it, you’d be rich.
You don’t have to bottle it, but you may want to spread it around.
 You’re in a new city. You’ve made new friends, you’re not on house arrest,
there are new restaurants to experience, new parks in which to picnic, new
museums to explore. Don’t substitute a search for dates before friends,
but once the friends are in place, it’s quite kosher to mention that you’re
new in town and looking — talk about your clean slate. Moving to a new
city is a really good time to get in the swing. You’ll learn the city faster
and have someone to share it with, someone who knows the sites taking
you around. Be sure to leave some time for you to be by yourself. Although
having someone along is great, time alone to explore your new surround-
ings is important, too. When you’re alone, you get to concentrate on the
parts of the city that really interest you.
 It’s New Year’s Day. Although a New Year’s Eve party is a really treacher-
ous first date experience, New Year’s Day itself can be a good reminder
that time is marching on, and if you want someone marching with you in
your parade, it’s a good time to push yourself a bit. (A New Year’s Day
introduction also can make a great opening line: “I decided meeting you
was going to be the first terrific thing I did for myself this year.”)
 A big event is coming up. A big deal event coming up in your life — a
wedding, a party, an anniversary — can be a useful motivation to offset
your lethargy or fear and inertia when it comes to dating. It can be a good
opening gambit. If you feel compelled to take a date to the big event, do
be a bit careful about making the big event the very first date. It’s quite
possible to have a couple of date-ettes to break the ice before the big
event. If possible, give yourself enough time to have a couple of dates or
even a couple of months before the event.
66
Part I: The Focus: Who Am I? 
The girl, the guy, and the dining hall
I was president of my freshman literary society
(sorta like a sorority, only less prestigious), so I
had to go to the formal. I was shy enough that I
undoubtedly never would have asked anyone if
it hadn’t been a must-do event. I ended up asking
the guy who washed dishes in the college dining
hall. He had sense enough to ask me to a movie
and take me for a walk the week before the big
date so we weren’t complete strangers. We had
a ball, and I ended up marrying him. Moral of the
story: no guts, no glory; if you need an excuse
to pony up your courage to ask someone out, it’s
okay to go for it.

The Final Word
If you’re getting the idea that the best time to begin dating is when you’re
feeling happy and terrific and cheerful and confident and busy and happy,
whether for the first time or after a hiatus or break from the action, you’re
right on target. The happier and more stable you are, the more attractive, the
more confident, and the more able you are to assess want you want while
presenting an accurate picture of who you are.
If you’re going through a rough time, don’t despair; it happens to all of us.
Keep in mind that dating isn’t the cure; it’s a complication. If you’re feeling
great and stable and happy — and most of all ready for an adventure — it’s
your time.
67
Chapter 5: Making Sure You’re Ready
Uncovering motivation
The night before a big party, I found myself wall-
papering my bathroom with a friend. Things
were getting a bit testy, and he said, “Your
friends won’t care whether or not the bathroom
wallpaper is new.”
I said, “You don’t understand. I’m not wallpa-
pering because of the party. I’m having the party
so that I’ll get the wallpapering done.”
In other words, you can use a big-deal social
event to motivate yourself to get out there — to
date or wallpaper or whatever.

Part II
Who Do I Want?

In this part . . .
Yeah, I know. You want Brad Pitt or Yasmine Bleeth or
Paul Newman or Whitney Houston. Or you’re looking
for the next Einstein or Madam Curie. But if you’re hanging
out at Joe’s Pub or sitting on your fanny in front of the tube,
the perfect date — someone who lights your fire, rings your
chimes, or at least doesn’t make you nauseous — is gonna
remain the stuff of fantasy instead of reality. 
In this part, we’re going to get real. You’ll find out how to
look for love in all the right places. What to say to Mr. or
Ms. Maybe Right. Which pick-up lines work and which
send a potential date screaming from the room. Most of
all, you’ll discover how to dip your toe gracefully into the
dating waters without falling flat on your face.

Chapter 6
Finding a Date
In This Chapter
 Dating with the right attitude
 Heading for the right places to find a date
 Steering clear of the wrong places
O
kay, if you started in Part I, you’ve done the hard work: You’ve looked
at who you are and what you want. You’ve examined those cute little
quirks that your Auntie Gertrude loves but that seem to drive your roommate
to distraction. You’ve been realistic about the kind of person you’re looking
for, and you’ve thought about how this hypothetical person would merge
with you to make a divine duo or at least a viable date. So what now?
In this chapter, you go hunting for Mr. or Ms. Right. (And if that’s too much
pressure, you can scout out Mr. or Ms. Maybe or Mr. or Ms. Right Now.) There
are terrific places to look, places to look with caution, and places where you
absolutely, positively don’t want to look (I’ll bet your first three choices fall
into the don’t-even-go-there category). So if you’re looking for information on
where, and where not, to go to meet people, you’re in the right place.
A Word about Attitude — Yours
Before I begin listing some of the good places to find somebody fun, let
me encourage you to be open — not open-minded about what I’m going to
suggest, but open to spontaneity. If you’re in Macy’s and a great-looking
person asks whether a particular color looks good with his or her hair,
you should hear bells and whistles: potential date, potential date, potential
date. Potential dates are everywhere, once you start looking. Just keep a few
things in mind:

 Be aware. Both men and women are understandably cautious about
being picked up by strangers, so if you’re the one doing the approach-
ing, the hallmarks of your approach have to be gentility, civility, humor,
and gentleness. Otherwise, somebody’s likely to call the cops on you.
I know — so what’s the problem? Cops are cute. Pay attention here;
I’m being serious.
 Be considerate. If someone has found the courage to approach you and
you’re not interested, unless they’re really, really scary, say no civilly.
You don’t have to be nasty.
 Don’t panic. If I were to promise you that you would meet the person of
your dreams in ten years, and the two of you would be wildly happy for
the rest of your lives, would you be willing to wait that ten years? Of
course you would (unless you’re already 110 years old — more about
that in Appendix A). So assume that meeting your dreamboat is just a
matter of time and, in the meantime, have fun, which definitely increases
your chances of being appealing when you run into that date-to-be ten
minutes, months, years, or decades from now.

Part II: Who Do I Want? 
Overcoming shyness
Most people are a little shy around new people,
especially people to whom they’re attracted. A
little shy is okay. A lot shy can keep you from the
three fundamentals of dating: 1) getting out there,
2) taking chances, and 3) enjoying life. These are
the three fundamentals to dating, so it’s impor-
tant to shake that shyness if it’s getting in the
way. To do that, here’s some stuff you can try:
 Meander around a busy public place for an
hour or two so you get used to being around
people.
 Practice smiling and making eye contact.
Lift your chin off your chest and nonverbally
connect with people who seem nice and
interesting to you. (No touching; just look
and smile.)
 Decide to chat with one new person a
week. You can do this in the grocery store,
the school cafeteria, or the line at the bank.
Nothing breeds success like success.
 Act “as if.” If all people waited until they were
totally comfortable before trying anything
new, no one would do anything new! Pretend
you’re not shy and act “as if” you’re full of
confidence.
 Calm yourself by telling yourself over and
over again that you’re safe and everything’s
going to be okay. Say it aloud in private and
in your head in public as often as necessary.
 Identify the worst-case scenario. What’s
the most hideous thing that could happen if
you walked up to someone you liked and
said, “Hi”? Putting a face on your fear helps
reduce it to a manageable size. For exam-
ple, the worst thing that might happen is the
person turns around and walks away. Yeah,
rejection hurts, but you’re not going to die
from it. Acceptance feels great, and you’ll
never experience it if you don’t take a
chance.
 Have fun! Shift the focus away from your
own fears and zero in on what makes some-
one else tick. Before you know it, you’ll
forget all about being shy.

Searching for the Best Places 
to Meet Someone
The best places to meet people are ones in which
 You can see clearly, hear clearly, and respond honestly.
 You have an interest in what’s going on, increasing the likelihood that
you’ll have something in common with anyone you meet there.
 The atmosphere feels safe and familiar.
It makes no sense to hang out in places where you hate the activity. Doing so
is kind of like people who feed their babies Gerber’s veal and then are surprised
when their kids like only veal, which the parents never eat. Hang out in places
where you would be happy even if you weren’t searching, and — bingo! —
you’re happy.
A place you enjoy, where you feel comfortable and safe, solves the problem
of what to talk about. The key is to be lighthearted about approaching a
stranger. The situation is similar to baking a soufflé. You need to tread gently
and avoid loud noises, early peeks, or banging doors. Otherwise, you’ll end
up with a dessert that nobody wants — flat, ugly, and unappetizing — despite
the effort and right ingredients you put into it.
The halls of academia
High schools, colleges, and adult education classes are all dating mills. You
can sit next to somebody in class for weeks, smile shyly, and eventually get
up the nerve to say, “Hi” or “Can I borrow your notes?” or “A bunch of us are
going for coffee.” So number one on the list of places to meet somebody is a
classroom: high school, college, traffic school, cooking school, power squadron
course, art history course, computer course — you get the point.
Find something you’ve always wanted to learn about and take a course. Even if
you don’t see any datables in your classroom, you’re out of the house, learning
and relating, and your chem partner may have a cute sibling who’s single.
The people in your neighborhood
You may find some very datable people in your own neighborhood. Familiarity
breeds comfort, and feeling safe and making the other person equally com-
fortable are important. So somebody you frequently run into or who knows
the people you know works for both of you.
73
Chapter 6: Finding a Date

Dating a neighbor has some advantages:
 You may already be acquainted with each other, and therefore, the 
situation isn’t as scary as approaching or being approached by a
stranger — and making somebody feel safe is a priority in this exercise.
 You probably run into the person often, giving you plenty of opportuni-
ties to take the bull by the horns (so to speak).
 You probably know many of the same people.
The only reservation about dating someone in your neighborhood is that you
should be careful about next-door neighbors. If the thing doesn’t work out,
the possibilities of being spied on increase greatly. Even if they don’t own
binoculars, the “bump intos” could feel uncomfortable, awkward, painful, or
embarrassing.
Parties, vacations, and other fun stuff
Fun places are some of the best places to scout out datables. Everybody’s
relaxed, open, less uptight, and prepared to be happy and smile (it’s the reason
for so many vacation romances). Here are a few of the best places to look:
 Parties: In terms of comfort, meeting someone at a party offers one of the
same advantages that meeting someone in your neighborhood offers:
You both know somebody in common.
 Cruises: Cruises can be the perfect vacation if you’re single, especially if
you don’t emphasize the need to meet someone. Cruises meet the criteria
for comfort and safety and, after a day or so, familiarity. Just be aware
that vacation atmospheres are more fantasy than reality, but don’t over-
look the potential here.
 Movies: Not everybody in line is coupled up; lots of singles go to movies,
so the line into the movie, especially if it’s a long line, is not a bad place
to get to know somebody. If you have the time to get to know each other
before the movie begins, offering to share popcorn can work, too. (Yeah,
I know the old joke about the chicken in the popcorn box. Puh-leeeeze.)
But if you talk in the movie, I’ll give you a piece of my mind.
 Dances: Folk dancing is great, as is square dancing, because the caller
tells you what to do, and you’re always changing partners. Ballroom
dancing is a bit iffier in that there is a huge premium put on doing it
well, and you’re pretty up-close and personal with someone. But if you
love to dance and you’re good at it and you don’t mind your feet getting
stomped occasionally, dancing does meet the something-in-common,
sorta nonthreatening thing.
If the music is loud, it’s often hard to talk when you’re dancing. If it’s
disco, forget about it — you’ll never hear a word each other speaks, but
then again, at least you don’t actually have to follow your partner.
74
Part II: Who Do I Want? 

Grocery stores, bus stops, and 
other public places
Ordinary places can be extraordinarily effective as meeting and greeting
grounds:
 Grocery stores: Buying food in the local market has that comfort/
familiarity/nurturing thing going. It’s a (usually) nonthreatening envi-
ronment, you’ve probably been there before, and if no one datable 
happens to meander in front of your grocery cart or pause invitingly in
the produce section, you can still pick up your milk and Ding-Dongs.
 Bus stops: Waiting at the same place and at the same time every day cre-
ates a sense of community. You see each other — and every other regular
passenger — here all the time, and you can sit together. The trick here is
to go slowly (pun intended). Don’t worry unless the person you’re inter-
ested in moves or switches jobs; you have plenty of time.
 Laundromats: What’s more domestic than airing your once dirty, now
clean, laundry in public? Always carry extra fabric softener and change
(you never know who may need to borrow something) and under no cir-
cumstances mention underwear.
 Bookstores: In some bookstore chains, you can curl up in a big comfy
chair and listen to jazz quartets — and even be tempted to chat each
other up. And if you happen to spy some cutie perusing your favorite
author’s latest, discussing the finer points over a soy latte in the book-
store café seems fun, savvy, and safe. Somehow being picked up in a
bookstore seems really smart, dontcha think?
 Restaurants: Asking to join someone sitting alone is a bit iffy. If the person
says yes, you don’t have to eat alone, but if the person says no, you may
lose your appetite. I once got up the nerve, after I’d finished my meal, to
ask someone if he would like company, and he said no; he really liked
eating alone. I was so rattled that I left the restaurant without signing my
bill, and the waiter came running after me. But if you have nerves of steel,
go for it. My experience is mercifully unusual. Most folks would be both
charmed and charming!
 Airplanes: You’re both together, going to the same place, side by side,
with a flight attendant to take care of everything you need — in addi-
tion to the hint of being united against a common danger in the clouds.
Hey, don’t miss the opportunity. Buses and trains have much of the
same criteria, but a little less cool of the factor. (Still, some pretty cool
movies have focused on train trips; think about the possibility of meet-
ing a Cary Grant, Mimi Rodgers, Gene Hackman, or Ingrid Bergman in
the dining car.)
75
Chapter 6: Finding a Date

Spiritualism and altruism — a dating duo
The tips in this section can be good for a two-fer: good works and good vibes —
a cool dating possibility:
 Places of worship: Many churches, mosques, temples, synagogues, and
other places of worship or spiritual activities have special singles ser-
vices and events, figuring that they’re safe and familiar and spiritual and,
with any luck at all, have the potential to increase the wedding business.
The only problem here is that you can’t date lots and lots of folks at the
same place of worship, or you’ll get a bad rep. So either be selective or
plan to change congregations should the need arise.
 Volunteer activities: Being your most altruistic self is hard to resist, and
having something in common with another altruistic soul gives you lots
to talk about. Just make sure that you like the activity itself. After all,
you don’t want to end up licking hundreds of envelopes to save sperm
whales because you heard fishermen have great poles.
 Political campaigns: Political campaigns offer a nearly perfect environ-
ment because volunteers share a common goal, campaigns don’t go on
forever, and the atmosphere is exciting and intense.
Good sports win big
You’ve probably always known that physical activity is good exercise and
great for your heart. You just didn’t know how great until now. Attention
couch potatoes: There are dating benefits to being even a spectator at a
sporting event, but active is best!
 Sport teams: Even if you’re a klutz, find a sport to play. It’s generally
safe, it’s fun, it’s physical, and team members almost always get together
afterwards — especially if they win. Even if you view yourself as the ulti-
mate klutz or hated gym, more and more leagues are demanding co-ed-ness
(please don’t tell my English teacher I used that word).
76
Part II: Who Do I Want? 
Heading to the “meet” market
When I lived in San Francisco, the Marina
Safeway was a famous place because you could
wander the aisles and talk broccoli, and those
really clever people would hang out at the meat
counter and offer to split the special large orders
that were “much too much for someone living
alone.” Cool, huh? You see the grocery store
theme at work here.

 Health clubs: Health clubs have a lot going for them: You’re among other
people doing essentially the same thing. You see the same familiar group
of people all the time. Keep in mind though that most people are in span-
dex and therefore often a bit shy, so be willing to go slowly.
 Individual sports: Even if you embrace the loneliness of the long-distance
runner, skier, mountain climber, shot putter, or cycler, there are clubs that
support your individuality while having great parties, useful Web sites,
and like-minded souls. If you run into the same person daily as you scoot
around the reservoir or walk your dog or peddle uphill, smile as you gasp.
 Sporting events: Most people are really relaxed when they watch sports —
unless it’s the playoffs — and they are quite willing to explain what’s going
on or to argue about who’s best. So asking the cute person next to you,
“Why did the ref call that penalty?” will likely result in a smile and an
explanation.
Friends, relatives, and — 
believe it or not — exes
The less strange the stranger you’re finding to date, the easier and more com-
fortable the early stages. People you both know and trust are a great bridge.
Whom can you trust more than your friends, your Mom, or your ex (assuming
that you two are still friendly)?
 Friends: Fix-ups are good news/bad news. On the good side, your friends
presumably wouldn’t fix you up with Jack (or Jackie) the Ripper, and
they probably know you well enough to know what you like. On the bad
side, often they want to know specifics, may choose sides, and will likely
be miffed if you don’t treat their friend right, don’t come up with the
details, or don’t spend as much time with them as you used to because
you’re seeing the friend. All things considered, fix-ups are often worth
the risk of somebody knowing your business, especially if your friends
are perceptive and know cool people.
 Relatives: Isn’t it fascinating what people who love us think we’ll love?
This outlet has all the problems of a friend fix-up with the added prob-
lems of gossip and the inability to ever go home for Thanksgiving if it
doesn’t work out. On the other hand, presumably they do love you and
will have to answer to your Mom if they come up with a real loser.
 Exes: Allowing your ex to fix you up with someone can be a bit dicey
(after all, an ex with an ax to grind can come up with a doozy of a loser).
On the other hand, who knows ya, baby? Whether you agree to such a
fix-up or not probably depends on the comfort of the break-up. If it was
super icky, you’re probably not speaking anyhow. But if your ex is still a
friend and other signs seem right, go for it. If your split-up was marked by
scream fests and flying fur, and you still refer to each other by unprintable
expletives, my advice is to politely decline.
77
Chapter 6: Finding a Date

The personals: Online and off
If you’re going to write a personal ad, find a journal, newspaper, or magazine
that reflects your interests and is available in your geographical area. For exam-
ple, if you enjoy sailing, then (“Hi sailor, new in town?”) a sailing magazine
may be a great place to place an ad. Or if you have a publication that you
read regularly — whether it’s the Times, the Mirror, a daily or weekly paper,
or a special interest magazine based on skills, industry, geography, sports,
interests, or income — a personal ad allows you to connect with readers with
whom you have something in common. As long as you’re going to the trouble
and expense of placing a personal ad, be specific and pick a publication that
reflects who you are, not who you’d like to be.
If you write well and can be very specific about who you are and what you
want, personal ads can work out well. The main thing is to play it safe:
 Don’t provide any identifying information (such as an address or phone
number) in the ad.
 Meet in a public place.
 Tell someone where you’re going and when you plan to be home.
 Don’t let anyone bring you home.
If you exercise reasonable caution in using a personal ad, there’s potential
here. For information on how to write a personal ad, see Chapter 2.
78
Part II: Who Do I Want? 
Picking the perfect date by birth order
If you want to know more about a guy or girl
you’re dating, the family tree is a good place to
look. Certain personality traits, unique to birth
position, tend to show up again and again in
family after family. For instance:
 The oldest child: He or she will tend to be
bossy, super-responsible, competitive, and
assertive.
 The middle child: A people pleaser, he or
she will often “make nice” in an effort to
keep things calm. Middle kids tend to be the
diplomats in the family and in life. It’s hard
to get them to take a stand or figure out
what they really want, and they can be a bit
manipulative.
 The youngest child: Adventurous, creative,
and confident, youngest children also tend
to be hyperemotional and needy at times.
They like being babied.
 The only child: After a childhood of being in
the spotlight of their families, only children
tend to crave attention and will aggressively
and charmingly seek it from you. They tend
to be disproportionately successful.

A personal ad is a good way to jazz up your social life, but remember that
this person is a stranger. Use the same caution you would with anyone you
don’t know and see Chapter 26 for information about dating someone you
haven’t “officially” met.
The same general rules that apply to print personal ads apply to online dating.
It’s in the same way that 20 years ago, the personals were considered fringe
and then moved into mainstream. Although five years ago the Internet was
considered marginal and overtly sexual, primarily for kinky liaisons or ques-
tionable activities or participants, these days Internet dating is pretty darn
mainstream and popular, encompassing literally millions of people. Although
some people may still be a bit shy about admitting to online dating (how come
I can’t find a date the “usual” way?), millions of folks view the Internet as a great
way of increasing the pool of eligible possibilities. (To maximize its potential
and minimize heartbreak, let alone catastrophe, see Chapter 29 for the list of
ten do’s and don’ts of online dating.) In a nutshell, your profile should look very
much like the one that you would put in a magazine or newspaper: Pretend
that you’re paying by the word (even though you’re not) so that you are suc-
cinct and specific. There have been studies that suggest that the longer the
personal ad (when wordage is charged) the greater the response implying the
author’s vast and unlimited bank account. Because there is no per-word charge
for online ads, the green effect is less likely, and going on and on may make you
look desperate, lonely, and disorganized. Be succinct, by giving an idea of
who you are and what makes you unique, as well as specifically who you’re
looking for. For more info, check out Online Dating For Dummies, by Judith
Silverstein, MD, and Michael Laskey, JD (published by Wiley).
By using some sense, sensitivity, and specificity, online or offline, personals
can energize your dating possibilities.
Avoiding Certain Places Like the Plague
You may be sorely tempted to go scouting for a date at the office, at a bar, or
online at work, but don’t. Trust me.
 The office: I know, you think, “Well, it’s nonthreatening and familiar.” Yeah,
and everybody will know about it, and one of you will very likely get fired.
Work is about competence, and anything that interferes with that is poison.
Most of us succumb to the M*A*S*H philosophy of life, based on the
popular TV series, but think about it this way: Want to lose your job and
your love at the same time? Dating someone from the office confuses your
work life with your love life and makes you a likely target of office gossip.
You may be tempted to date friends, sibs, or exes of people you work
with, but doing so is still not a good idea, so don’t, at least unless you
plan to change jobs — voluntarily.

Chapter 6: Finding a Date

 Bars: “What can she possibly be thinking here?” you may wonder. How
about it’s dark, almost everybody has been ingesting substances that
alter perception, and who needs a relationship based on blurred sensi-
bilities? Plus bars are too noisy to talk in, and you can’t see what the
person looks like. If nothing else, how do you answer, “Come here often?”
 Online: Even though I’m a fan of online dating, there are four caveats here:
1) Never use the office computer — it’s not private, it’s not smart, and you
could get both busted and fired. 2) Don’t spend too long online before you
actually meet in a safe, controlled environment. 3) Because it’s so easy and
private, the resultant false sense of intimacy can allow you to divulge too
much too soon. 4) The accessibility gives rise to a “shopping” mentality —
“I’ll just keep looking; I wonder who else might be out there. . . .”
Online is primarily about fantasy. It’s the illusion of intimacy while still
being at arm’s length. When you do meet face to face, there is all that
expectation. Even with a blind date, you know that you don’t know.
It’s okay to chat, but online is the ultimate long-distance relationship.
You’ll think you know much more than you really know, and that’s really
tricky. So get off-line quickly.
 Singles dances: The air of desperation is palpable, but if you can go and
have fun, you’ll probably do okay, because you’ll stand out as the only
person really having a good time.
 Singles weekends: These weekends mean too much stress and expecta-
tions that are too high. You’re better off spending the same money and
taking a cruise; at least that way you can feel your money is well spent
even if you don’t fall in love.
Singles activities are designed to pair you off, but you may have nothing in
common but desperation or loneliness, which won’t work and doesn’t make
you look anything but pathetic. If you’re going to adopt this approach, at least
build up some experience and confidence by doing some of the preferred
activities included in the earlier sections.

Part II: Who Do I Want? 
The breakfast of ex-companions
A guy I dated, but with whom I felt no chemistry,
and I hosted a series of brunches with all of our
“rejects.” Not only were they fun and low-key,
but both he and six other couples found each
other and actually ended up married. Exes have
a history in common with you; there’s a common
link, so it’s not strangers meeting (you can both
talk about old Joey); and brunch is a pretty non-
threatening meal.
Of course, you don’t have to have a brunch. You
can organize singles parties at a Chinese
restaurant, a progressive supper (one that trav-
els from house to house), or a picnic in the park.
The ticket of admission is a covered dish and a
same-sex friend who you think is quality mater-
ial but who doesn’t make your heart beat fast.
Just make sure you have the same number of
men and women.

Chapter 7
Planning a Cool Approach
In This Chapter
 Making eye contact
 Approaching someone without scaring him or her away
 Giving compliments that work
 Using pick-up lines
O
kay, person who’s ready to begin dating for real, we’ve discussed who
(both you and other, in Chapter 4) and we’ve talked where (both places
to look and places to avoid, in Chapter 6). Now, you with sweaty palms, let’s
talk how: how to turn possibility into opportunity, how to go for the gold, how
to make the sale — in short, how to get a date.
The Eyes Have It
First rule: Eye contact is crucial. If you can’t connect with eye contact, you
can’t connect. Eyes are not only the window to the soul, but being connected
directly to the brain, they’re the primary information gateway for human beings
(and we know that everything comes from the brain, in spite of your humming
hormones). Make eye contact. No looking down at your shoes. No checking
out buns or breasts or legs.
Focus your baby blues on the potential date’s baby blues. But for heaven’s
sake, don’t stare (and remember to blink). You want to be perceived as soul-
ful, not psychotic. The goal here is to show that you’re interested and sane.
From Your Mouth . . .
After you make the contact with eyeballs, you need to verbalize what your
eyes are telegraphing.

Using what works
When you approach someone, take this advice:
 Be sincere. The key to being sincere is to mean what you say. Pleeeeze
don’t practice sincerity in front of the mirror. For sincerity to work, you
have to focus on the object (person, please) of your desire and believe
what you’re saying. In the most basic sense, you are selling yourself, but
the soft sell works the very best.
 Be honest. If you’re a rotten dancer, say in a self-effacing, engaging way
that you have two left feet. Don’t try to make yourself someone you’re
not to impress someone you may or may not like. Don’t pretend to love
jazz, collect Porsches, or own a yacht. On the other hand, telling the
truth isn’t the same as baring your soul. To find out what you should and
shouldn’t divulge, see Chapter 20. Also, when it comes to discussing the
other person, remember what your momma said: If you can’t say some-
thing nice, don’t say anything at all.
 Be friendly. Who doesn’t like friendly people? When you’re friendly, you
smile, you’re open, and you’re fun to be around.
 Be positive. I’m not talking goody-two-shoes here, just pleasant and
upbeat.
82
Part II: Who Do I Want? 
How to flirt
Successful flirting is all about fun and confidence
and playfulness and sexiness. Unsuccessful
flirting is about being too out-there, too sexual,
too self-absorbed, and too eager to flirt with
anyone. Basic rule: Flirt with your date, not the
waiter, hostess, your date’s best friend, or her
mom. That said, you can find more about flirting
in Chapter 13, but here’s some info on how to flirt
with style:
 Be interested. Few things are sexier than
someone who’s totally into you. Paying gen-
uine attention is a great place to start.
 Lock eyes. Don’t stare, but connect with
your eyes and you have a better chance of
connecting with your hearts.
 Play. Good flirting is fun. Don’t be afraid to
giggle and tease.
 Touch. Brush arms, bump knees beneath the
table, tweak noses.
 Flatter. A sincere appraisal of what you
really like about this person is a turn-on.
False praise, however, is a total turn-off.
 Take a chance. Flirting, by its very nature, is
active. Sitting back and waiting for some-
one to flirt with you may mean you put in
more couch time than flirt time. Take a stab.
Unless you drool all over your date or flirt-
mate, you have nothing to lose. Who doesn’t
like a little flirting?

Avoiding what doesn’t work
When you’re approaching someone, don’t be any of the following:
 Cute: Unless you’re 6 years old, the Little Bo Peep routine gets pretty
annoying pretty fast.
 Slick: When you think of slick, think of snake oil salesmen. People don’t
trust slick.
 Obscene: Nothing is a bigger turn-off than lewd or disgusting gestures,
jokes, and personal observations. Remember you’re in civilized society;
if that doesn’t work, pretend your mother can hear every word you say.
 Silly: Straws up your nose and lampshades on your head have never
been attractive, so give it up and act like an adult.
 Stupid: Acting stupid puts you in a catch-22: I mean, really, you act stupid
to attract someone’s attention, but do you really want the attention of
someone who finds stupid attractive?
 Negative: Gossiping about someone brings up the very real possibility
that you would gossip about present company.
 Whiny: Please . . . I really don’t have to explain this to you, do I?
A word on compliments
It’s okay to be complimentary as long as the compliment is sincere and at
least fairly reasonable and stays away from body parts below the neck and
above the ankles. Saying to a fat person, for example, that he doesn’t sweat
much isn’t even in the compliment ballpark. Saying “You remind me of my
grandmother” (for either sex) isn’t too hot, either.
83
Chapter 7: Planning a Cool Approach
Love and negotiations at first site
One of the most focused first dates I ever heard
of happened between the people from whom I
bought my apartment. They had met in passing
at a seminar years earlier. Then they bumped
into each other at a party. He got her phone
number and called her. He said that he had to
go out and check on his summer cottage to see
whether there had been any hurricane damage
and asked if she’d like to come along. She said
she was looking to get married and have kids
and had no interest in “casual dating.” He said
he wouldn’t even consider that kind of serious-
ness unless he’d had sex with a woman first.
Before the first date, they’d negotiated a week-
end together, sex, and a potential for marriage
and kids. While I’m not sure I would recommend
this approach to everyone, it worked splendidly
for them; they were married within six months
and pregnant shortly thereafter. Being this
focused certainly makes a statement. Like my
mom says, “You don’t ask, you don’t get.”

It’s okay to compliment men on their:
 Hair: Thick, shiny, wavy, healthy locks, a nice cut, an attractive color.
Talking hair is pretty safe. But don’t talk about receding hairlines, bald
spots, early graying, or anything else that may be a sensitive topic.
Don’t make even a casual reference to dandruff; avoid the words flake
and flaky for at least five minutes after talking about hair.
 Eyes: Blue, green, black, or brown, all God’s children love to hear that
they’ve got nice eyes. Some particularly good adjectives? Try bright, clear,
beautiful, expressive, warm, laughing, and sensitive. Avoid sexy until the
third date.
 Neck: If he’s got a neck like a wrestler, tell him. If it’s a chicken neck, let
it pass.
 Tie: Cut, color, style. But don’t say you want to use it to tie him to a 
bedpost — at least not yet. Make sure it’s patterned and not grease
stained before you comment on the unusual design.
 Socks: Some men take a lot of care picking their socks. Stun — and
impress — him by noticing, but never lift his pant leg without asking.
 Smile: Men love to hear that they’ve got a charming, handsome, alluring
smile.
 Teeth: A bit more personal. Shiny is good, but big, dangerous, or sharp
should not be noted.
Women find praise for essentially the same things really cool:
 Hair: Women spend a lot of time on their hair, and they like the effort to
be noticed. But don’t touch without asking, be careful about noting an
unusual color (two out of three women in America color their hair), and
never say “dye.”
 Eyes: The same rules apply for women that apply for men. Like I said
before, everyone likes to be complimented on his or her baby blues
(or greens, etc.).
84
Part II: Who Do I Want? 
Just when you think a compliment’s safe . . .
Believe it or not, even conservative compli-
ments can occasionally get you in trouble. I was
working on a TV show and a very well-known
actor was in make-up with me.
I said, “Love your hair.”
He said, “It’s a piece.”
“Nice teeth,” I responded.
“They’re caps,” said he.
“Beautiful eyes?”
“Contacts.”
At that point, I said, “Nice package,” and left it
at that — and I wasn’t even flirting.

 Neck: Complimenting a woman on her neck can often be a bit iffy — unless
it’s long and slender. If her neck is as thick as a linebacker’s, though, you
can comment on skin unless she’s wearing something really low cut.
 Smile: Women love to hear that they’ve got a warm, engaging, sweet smile.
 Teeth: If you don’t know how to give a compliment on teeth without
coming off as an oral surgeon, go for the smile instead.
Stay away from body parts — even muscles (in either sex). Also, compliment-
ing women’s shoes can be a bit tricky, raising the possibility of a foot fetish.
It’s just not worth the risk this early on. Avoid the killer b’s: buns, breasts,
briefs, bazooms.
Admitting you’re not perfect
Given the reality that making the acquaintance of a stranger is tricky stuff
(even if you believe that a stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet), the
idea is to be nonthreatening without looking like a complete wimp. That’s
why being vulnerable really works. Consider the following:
 Asking for help, directions, or an opinion. Most people are more than
willing to jump in and help out, so take advantage of that tendency. Helping
others brings out the best in all of us and also feels safe. At that moment,
you’re in control. (Supermarkets are a natural; see Chapter 6 for details.)
 Admitting that you’re nervous. Admitting that you’re nervous because
you think someone is so cool is complimentary and sweet and honest. But
once is plenty; more than that is whiny and makes you sound like an over-
strung bundle of nerves. Panic isn’t sexy, and it’s sometimes contagious.
 Admitting that you don’t normally do this but you’re so inspired that
you’ve ignored your usual shyness, fear, or sense of propriety. Think
about it: Aren’t you impressed when someone puts in extra effort and
seems to be doing something for the very first time and you are the moti-
vation? Heady stuff.
85
Chapter 7: Planning a Cool Approach
Do or dare: Making the approach
I was once at a wretched party in the back room
of a bar in San Francisco. To make matters
worse, the women outnumbered the men 10 to 1.
But in the front part of the bar, there were all
these cute guys. So I said to the hostess, “Why
don’t you invite them?” She snottily replied,
“Why don’t you?” I took it as a challenge and
meandered up to a group of five guys and said,
“Somebody just bet me a dollar I couldn’t con-
vince the five cutest guys here to come to the
party, and I could use the money.” Not only did
they laugh and join the party, but three of ’em
asked me out. This is something I never would
have considered doing if I hadn’t been “dared.”
Remember what Helen Keller said: “Life is
daring risk, or it’s nothing at all.”

Being persistent is okay as long as your persistence can’t possibly be mis-
taken for stalking behavior (see Chapter 27).
Perking up pick-up lines
Don’t even think about using lines like these:
 “Come here often?”
 “What’s your sign?”
 “I must have died and gone to heaven, because where else would I see
an angel like you?”
 “If I told you that you have a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?”
The danger with overused, hackneyed pick-up lines is that they generally end
up sounding like the equivalent of “Oh, baby, baby, hmm, hmm, hmm.”
So rather than practicing a pick-up line, follow these two guidelines:
 Focus on the situation and your feelings. “I couldn’t help myself; I just
had to come over and tell you your smile was keeping me from concen-
trating,” is ever so much better than “New around here?” “Do you know
the hostess?” “Heard any good jokes?” and so on.
 If the line sounds like a title to a country song, don’t use it.
Of course, an original pick-up line can be memorable. I have never forgotten a
guy who said he knew I wasn’t from around here (I was in Alaska at the time)
because I didn’t smell like fish. While I’m sure this line probably worked for
him once or twice, I just giggled and remembered the line, not him.
Never say, “My wife doesn’t understand me” or “You’re the best-looking person
in the room” or “Want to spend the night with me?” on the assumption that if
you don’t ask, you don’t get. We’re talking about finding a date, not spending
the night in jail.
86
Part II: Who Do I Want? 
Nice line, but no sale
The best pick-up line I ever got came from a guy
who explained to me that he always compli-
ments beautiful women on their brains and
smart women on their beauty. He then paused,
looked at me soulfully, and said, “And you’re so
darn smart.”
I was smitten but decided he was probably too
slick for me.

Part III
Setting Up
the Date

In this part . . .
P
opping the question “Will you go out with me?” is
scary and thrilling and sweat-producing and a whole
lot like leaping backward off the high-dive if you don’t know
what you’re doing. How do you up your chances of getting
a yes while leaving enough room to bow out gracefully if
the answer is no? Good question, and one that will be fully
examined in this part — as well as the dreaded phone
number thing (yours, mine, or ours?), transportation con-
cerns, and, of course, date location, location, location.
Not to worry. You’ll get all the info you need to sail
smoothly over each hurdle . . . or at least be able to pick
yourself up off the blacktop, brush off your knees, and
walk with dignity back to the starting line, to a bandage,
or to the locker room to gear up for the next race.

Chapter 8
Asking for a Date
In This Chapter
 Rejecting fear
 Getting to “Yes!”
 Doing it (not that “it”)
 Coping with the answer
W
hether a date’s spontaneous or planned, the first or the last date, or
you’re young or old, sooner or later, going out with someone comes to
this: Somebody has to ask for the date.
No matter how much or how little you plan (and regardless of your reputation,
your Aunt Sylvia, the knot in your stomach, the advice of your friends, your
New Year’s resolution, or your success with dating or lack thereof) nobody,
with the possible exception of Adam, ever made a date without asking for it. I
bet that even with God as the go-between, sooner or later Eve expected Adam
to pony up and find the courage to ask if they could take a walk in Paradise,
and if he didn’t, well, it explains a lot about the snake, don’t you think?
Face it, the only thing scarier than the first date is asking for the first date.
But if you can remember that you’re not looking for a cure for cancer, that
you won’t die even if he or she says “yes,” and that life as we know it will con-
tinue no matter what your potential date’s response, you may relax enough to
actually (gulp) ask for a date.
Gazillions of perfectly normal (and lots of less than normal) people have all
gotten nervous about asking for a date. You and I and everybody else are con-
nected to a long line of sweating, nervous, stuttering, tongue-tied souls, and
even the slick ones feel anxious on the inside about asking for a date. Do you
feel better? No? Well, I was afraid of that. Never fear — in this chapter, I tell
you some things that should comfort you in the asking, help you in the con-
summation, and protect you from any possible devastation beyond a teensy
pinch on the ego.

Risking Rejection
The First Rule to asking for a date is this: No guts, no glory. The worst-case
scenario is that the prospective date says no. At that point, you’re no worse
off than you are at this very moment.
Rejection is definitely not fun, but a rejection is only one person’s opinion of
you. You don’t like everyone, and not everyone is going to like you. If some-
one says no, then he or she misses out on getting to know how truly terrific
you are.
Rejection can be the beginning of opportunity. Scads of hugely successful
people just wouldn’t take no for an answer. Think about Fred Astaire: When he
first went to Hollywood, a talent scout wrote, “Big ears, too skinny, big nose,
can dance a little.” Many famous beauties and stars in many fields had to cope
with someone’s negative opinion of them — nobody hasn’t faced rejection.
The question is: Are you going to let it get you down? Of course not! Alexander
the Great probably conquered the world by the age of 30 because some short-
sighted lass turned him down — maybe because he was too intense or short
or something. Maybe that rejection made him want to make more than most
Grecians earn. (It’s a pun; say it out loud — but definitely don’t use it until the
fourth or fifth date or after you’re married or your last kid leaves for college
or your hearing has gone.)
Rejection means that that person says no but not that everyone will. You
need to realize when no is no, when someone’s showing absolutely no inter-
est. If someone consistently says no when you ask for a date, it’s okay to say,
“Look, I hear that you’re not interested, and I don’t want to be a pest. If you
ever change your mind, here’s my number,” or “I’ll call you in a year,” but
then for heaven’s sake, don’t call any sooner than that. With time, the sting
really does go away.
Conversely, if you really don’t want to go out with someone, don’t say, “Maybe”
or “Call me next week.” Just say, “Thank you for asking, but it’s just not possi-
ble.” Remember that the world is a very small place. You may change your
mind, or that person you turn down may marry your best friend or be in a
position to hire you someday. There is no reason to ever hurt someone whose
only sin is being interested in you, so be gentle but firm.
Rejection isn’t gender specific. It’s not any easier for guys to face rejection
than it is for women. We’ve just programmed men for power, and asking
someone out is boss, even if the whole experience is tinged with fear. Either
sex can feel more powerful by taking the initiative and asking someone out.
90
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

Biology has nothing to do with the ability to tolerate possible rejection. Women,
if you’ve never asked a guy out, you should do it for your own liberal education.
Guys love it. However, they may think you’re hotter to trot (sexually) than you
really are, so take that into consideration.
If you’re afraid of rejection, you may miss out on a lot in this life, which is pretty
darned short as it is. See if you can put that angst away, take the chip off your
shoulder, and go for it.
Improving Your Odds
When asking for a date, having a plan is crucial, but you’ve got to stay a little
loose. The more structured you are, the more dependent you are on meshing
well with a stranger. Therefore, you need to read the signs, stay loose, and
keep things light, flexible, and open. You can seriously improve the chances
of getting a yes if you keep these tips in mind when you ask for a date.
Never ask for a first date for a 
Friday or Saturday night
These two main, big, serious date nights are too important a place to start.
Asking for a first date on a Friday or Saturday is like playing at Wimbledon with-
out a tennis lesson or having ever played on grass or at all. Even people who
don’t have dates and haven’t had one for ages are often loathe to admit their
plight to a stranger (and if you haven’t had a first date, you’re still strangers).
Start off with a Wednesday or Thursday night, which are nights when people
generally don’t have much planned. Also avoid Mondays like the plague.
Everybody hates Mondays.
91
Chapter 8: Asking for a Date
A brush-off with style
The coolest rejection I ever got was from a guy
who told me that he’d just gotten a call from an
old girlfriend. He said, “She’s reemerged in my
life, and I need to see where it goes. I’ll either
marry her and invite you to the wedding, or I’d
like to finally put it to rest. No matter what hap-
pens, I’d like to be able to call you.” Cool, huh?

Never say, “Would you like 
to go out sometime?”
If you phrase the invitation like this and the askee says “no,” you’ve left your-
self absolutely no out except to be swallowed up by a prayed-for earthquake.
If the person says “yes,” you still have to ask him or her out. Yikes.
Instead, be specific. It’s much better to say, “I’d love to see the new exhibit at
the museum. Any interest in going either Wednesday or Thursday?” You offer
a specific opportunity (as well as alternative days) and at the same time, you
give your potential date a great deal of room in which to negotiate without
sounding wishy-washy or desperate. Giving specifics also allows your poten-
tial date a couple of seconds to think about it, rather than getting caught
completely off guard.
Always offer options about the date
Options can include the day, time, activity, and transportation. Options make
you sound organized without being bossy or rigid, as long as you keep them
limited. Offering a few choices at the outset makes you sound less panicky
than you would if you were to offer them after the potential date says no to
your initial suggestion.
If you’re specific about the date and your potential date doesn’t like the sug-
gested activity but does like you, you can modify your plan.
Also, although a plan with several separate possibilities requires more work
on your part, it offers a better chance of success — and a chance to figure
out whether your potential date has any interest in you. After all, if you’ve
offered all options regarding place, time, date, activity, and so on and the
answer is still no, the problem is as clear as the writing on the wall, and
you’ve hit the wall. Take a deep breath and move on. It’s not the end of the
world, just this potential date. Scary but efficient.
By offering to meet there, go in separate cars, or pick her up, you instantly show
yourself to be considerate, capable, and sensitive to the fact that females have
heard horror stories about being abducted by a date and never seen again.
Although you’re not Jack the Ripper, understanding that she may feel a little
uneasy about being in a car with a stranger makes you a liberated and cool
guy for thinking like a modern woman. You will score major points.
In the initial stages of dating, people sometimes want so much to be liked
that they agree to things at the expense of their integrity. If your potential
date has enough sense to say, “I’d love to do something with you, just not
92
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

mud wrestling,” then give that person a gold star. Don’t be offended — be
pleased. You have just found someone with brains, courage, and honesty.
Remember that timing is everything
Don’t ask for tomorrow or next year. A basic rule is to ask for a first date a
week to ten days in advance, but you can break this rule with impunity as
the need arises. You can ignore these guidelines if the spirit moves you to be
spontaneous. For example, “Hey, got time for an ice cream cone?” can get you
an immediate yes; you can also expand this invitation to a “maybe next week”
if you get a no.
Now is always a better time to ask than later because your courage may
diminish over time. There are some obvious exceptions to this rule: Don’t ask
someone who is in a crisis (never ask for a date at a funeral), just getting out
of a relationship (never ask for a date at a divorce hearing, even if the person
isn’t one of the parties involved; it’s bad karma), or going through any other
experience when you may appear to be exploiting a weakness. You need to
take the other person’s life situation into account as well.
Always go for it if you’re having a 
good hair or anything else day
You’re cuter when you’re happy, and self-confidence is sexy. Don’t get into
the “well, today is a write-off, I may as well ask, get rejected, and make it a
perfect score” mentality. You can tolerate being turned down more easily
when you’re feeling strong — not to mention that rejection is a lot less likely.
Asking someone out for a first date isn’t the time to trot out your best anything,
including your imagination, checkbook, or best friend. This is a time to think
KISS: Keep it Simple, Sweetie. All you want to do here is send a clear and gentle
but important message: I’d like to spend some time getting to know you better.
Are you interested?
The Invitation: Sending the Message
You have several options when actually asking for the date. The choices may
be influenced by circumstances (like distance), personality, and personal style.
In general, the closer you are when you ask, the better. When you’re close to
the person, you get more information, you appear more courageous, and you
get some practice for the date.
93
Chapter 8: Asking for a Date

You can adapt any of the following methods for sending the message to your
level of comfort. But be careful that you’re not hiding behind your comfort
level — sooner or later, you’re going to have to get out there and actually date.
 Asking in person: When possible, this is the best way to ask by far
because seeing the person face-to-face gives you the most information.
You can read body language and see whether the potential date looks
pleased, terrified, God-forbid-revolted, or delighted. Based on the other
person’s reaction, you can then modify your behavior accordingly or
run. The disadvantage with asking in person is that it’s also the scariest
for the exact same reasons. But it’s still preferred and also the friendliest
technique.
 Asking on the phone: This method gives you less information, but if you
get panicky, you can always hang up before they answer (although caller
ID has made hanging up without saying anything a great deal trickier).
When you ask over the phone, nobody can see your palms sweating; but
then again, you also can’t see your potential date’s reaction.
Never ask an answering machine for a date. It’s cowardly, sends the
wrong message (you’re manipulating them by making them call back
before you ask them out), and occasionally, the machine actually eats
the message. You never know if your potential date got the message or if
it was intercepted by a protective parent, a jealous ex, a careless room-
mate, or the Fates.
 Asking through a third party: In elementary school, you may have asked
your best friend to ask her best friend if someone liked you. You may
have even eventually gotten an answer, but after Suzy told Peter, and
Peter told you, were you really 100 percent sure about the answer?
Third parties are a very unreliable method of information flow.

Part III: Setting Up the Date 
Answering machine etiquette
An answering machine message, unlike an off-
the-cuff remark or rumor or discussion, can be
saved and replayed and misinterpreted and
overanalyzed and overreacted to and thrown
back in your face. Not only that, but you never
know who’s going to be listening on the other
end. Here are six messages never to leave on a
date’s machine:
 You’re the best I’ve ever had.
 I never want to see you again.
 It’s me. Give me a call.
 Next time, we’ll go out.
 Your mother is hot.
 Can I have your friend’s phone number?

When other people get involved, sometimes they add their two cents to
your message. For example, what if your best friend liked me and wanted
you to ask me if I’d go out on a date with him? Can you see lots of room
for sabotage and miscommunication?
Remember the story of our Pilgrim forefathers, John Alden and Miles
Standish? Miles was the governor who asked his best friend John to
intercede on his behalf with Priscilla Mullens. Priscilla decided she liked
the messenger, and Miles was left out in the cold. Don’t ask somebody
else to ask for your date. The messenger may end up taking your poten-
tial date, and then not only do you still need a date but you also need a
new friend.
 Asking with a note: Even though computers have made notes faster and
sexier, notes don’t offer you much information and feedback, whether
they’re e-mail or snail mail (through the post office).
When you ask with a note, you also don’t know the mood your potential
date may be in. In addition, a note opens the opportunity for intercep-
tion, misinterpretation, a delay in feedback, and a lack of flexibility. Ask
anybody who’s asked for an RSVP to a written invitation, and you begin
to understand the problem with asking for a date through a note.
If you’re absolutely determined to ask for a date in writing, I suggest a
handwritten note via the post office because it’s classier and implies
more effort and concern.
A brief note here on sending a note with flowers, cigars, wine, a baseball
hat, a ticket, or any gift: Sending gifts with the note is cute but tricky.
You don’t want to appear to be bribing your potential date on the first
date. Gifts can be a token of respect and admiration and are okay and
even valuable as you’re getting to know each other, but they can be too
much too soon. Besides, you don’t want to have to top yourself later and
end up buying your potential date a small country by the fourth date.
Start out simply.
Getting an Answer
Okey, dokey — you’ve made plans, offered options, and asked for a date. Now
what? Well, either the answer is yes, you have a date, or no, you don’t.
If the answer is yes, you’re flying and ready to go on to planning the old 
date-aroony.
95
Chapter 8: Asking for a Date

Dealing with a no
If the answer is no, you have nothing to lose by asking if another day, place,
time, or event would suit them. Listen to the response carefully. Often people
really are tied up working late, taking care of a sick parent, getting out of a
relationship, studying, or being distracted and would be willing to consider
an invitation in the future, just not now.
If you’re feeling brave, you can say, “If not now, how soon?” If you’re feeling a
bit vulnerable, you can say, “Let me give you my number, and you can give
me a call when you’re ready.” The middle ground is to say, “Why don’t I give
you a holler in a week or two and see how you’re doing?” If your potential
date says fine, then do it. If he or she says “I’ll call you,” don’t hold your
breath. Who needs to turn blue?
Getting some feedback
If you get a no, you may want to take a minute to try to figure out why. Make
sure you haven’t gotten into some bad habits. You may need to ask yourself
some tough questions. Are you too eager, too desperate, too whiny, too silly,
or too tense? Is your breath okay? Do you make eye contact?
No matter how honest you think you are, give yourself some balance by asking
a willing friend to critique your approach (you’ve seen it in a million movies
where the hero or heroine practices in front of a mirror — no, not Travis
Bickle’s “You lookin’ at me?” line). Balance your friend’s feedback with your
own opinion so that you’re not being too easy or too harsh on yourself. If you
mess up your careful scenario, your friend can give you some tips and hints
on improving it, and you can make sense of what you meant to say or do.
Practicing can help you get a grip on your nerves. A little nervousness is flat-
tering to the potential date because it shows that you really want to get to
know him or her. Too much nervousness can panic both of you. All things
considered, it’s probably even better to be a little bit nervous than so non-
chalant and cool that your potential date has the sense you couldn’t care less
if he or she accepts your invitation or not, because if he or she isn’t interested,
no biggie, it’s not them, you’ll just move on to someone else. It’s not a terrible
idea to start a first date on an honest basis. I know — don’t tell anybody I told
you, and we’ll try to keep it our dirty little secret.

W
e live in a society that is both more open and more frightened than
any that has ever existed before. In the United States, the idea of the
chaperone has become a quaint part of our history. What we’ve forgotten is
that a chaperone served a very distinct purpose: A chaperone allowed two
people to get together, while keeping an eye on things. Sure, you couldn’t
hold hands, or kiss, or — heaven forbid — do anything more intimate without
being tsk-tsked to kingdom come, but it also meant that you didn’t have to
worry about improper or uncomfortable advances or fret that your date
would interpret your intentions as less than honorable.
Having a chaperone along on a date may have felt restrictive, but it also
meant safety. Today that restriction — and that safety — are gone. Now
you’re faced with the same urge to merge but with few guidelines and no one,
other than yourself, for protection.
If the two of you are ever going to have a date, you have to be able to connect.
Of course, you could agree to meet on a specific street corner or at a party or
restaurant or after a class. But sooner or later, it will occur to one of you that
being able to get in touch if plans should change would be nice — and that
means a more personal way to connect, and that means a phone number.
Getting a phone number means that the two of you have moved from being
strangers to at least being acquaintances, and that can be a very large and
somewhat scary first step. To compound the problem, men and women have
different senses of times and different sensibilities. Men often feel they have

to ask for a number even when they have no interest, and women often feel
they have to give out a number even if they have no interest. To help you,
this chapter covers how to both get and give a phone number — with the
minimum wear and tear on both of you. It also covers what to say during the
call, and if you’re hesitant to hand out your home phone number, you can
also find phone number alternatives.
Asking for a Number
Whether you were introduced by friends, ran into one another on the street,
or met at a party, unless you believe that the two of you share a karma that
will cause you to run into one another again and again, you’re either going to
have to depend on blind fate or you’re going to have to get a number: a home
phone number or a cell number (a great option because it allows you to give
out a number without having to transpose one of the last digits for someone
you don’t really want to give your phone number to.) If you really don’t want
to give a phone number, don’t do it. Give a street address, an e-mail address,
a business card, or something. (I know there’s always the mutual friend route,
but you’re not in 7th grade any more — I hope. Plus, if you contact the other
person directly, you get a lot more — and more reliable — information.)
There are only a limited number of reasons why you might ask for a phone
number:
 You want to call the person.
 You’re not sure whether you want to call the person but want the
number just in case.
 You know you don’t want to call, but you don’t want to appear rude.
The following sections give you tips for handling each of these scenarios.
You want to get in touch with the person
When you know you want to call someone, obviously you need to ask for the
phone number. One of the best ways to approach getting someone else’s
number is to demonstrate your good faith and to show that you’re not Jack
or Jacqueline the Ripper:
 Smile, talk softly, and make eye contact. See Chapter 7 to find out how
to approach someone without scaring the daylights out of them.
98
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

 Ask for the number in a friendly, nonthreatening way. For example,
instead of saying, “So, can I have your number?” try something like, “I’d
really like to stay in touch. Is there a number where I can reach you?”
Giving out your phone number if you want to is certainly okay, but doing
so puts you in the position of waiting for his call. The best way to offset
this position of passivity is to ask for his number as well. Or you can
take his and not give yours. (Of course, if you have no intention of call-
ing him, don’t ask for the number. It’s just as nasty for you to ask for
his number and not call as it is for him to ask for your number and then
not call you.) See the section “Giving Your Phone Number” later in this
chapter for advice on how to take an active role in getting together.
 Offer your own number. Offering your number is a great way to deflect
suspicion by putting the proverbial ball in the other person’s court.
Offering rather than asking also allows you to be vulnerable first.
You can win sensitivity points by saying, “Look, I know these days, a 
gorgeous woman like you has to be careful, so if you would prefer, I 
can give you a way to get in touch with me. I’d love to court you the 
old-fashioned way and call you, but I don’t want to make you feel 
uncomfortable by asking you to give me your number if you’re not
ready.”
You want to keep your options open
In a perfect world, you could actually say, “I’m not sure I want to call you, but,
what the heck, give me your number just in case.” Of course, a line like that
isn’t exactly flattering. You’re probably better served by expressing an inter-
est but giving yourself an out by saying something like this:
“Look, I’d really love to call you, but I’m . . . (pick one)
really busy at work
traveling a lot
getting out of a relationship
covered with herpes
feeling poorly (not poor, which means you’re in the midst of pecuniary
strangulation)
scheduled for surgery
about to be drafted
99
Chapter 9: Getting a Phone Number

. . . so if it’s okay, I’d like to take your number and call you in a month or 
so.” (Of course, if you use the herpes line, don’t expect them to be too 
enthusiastic.)
When you take this approach, you’re not misleading anyone or setting the
other person up to hang by the phone waiting for you to call. You’re simply
keeping your options open without doing so at someone else’s expense.
If you’re feeling really ambivalent about asking for a phone number, you can
always offer yours, saying, “Why not take my number?” Then if the other
person calls, you can go out on his or her nickel and enthusiasm. After all, all
of us like to be courted.
You’re not interested in the other person,
but you feel it’s expected of you to ask
for a number
If you’re not interested, don’t ask for the number. If you ask for a number, the
assumption is that you intend to use it. Don’t spread misery like peanut
butter. If you have absolutely no interest in the other person and have no
intention of calling, just don’t ask.
Men especially feel that not asking for a phone number is really rude, but if
you can just confine yourself to “See you around” or “Nice seeing you again,”
you’ll spare yourself and the other person some wear and tear.

Advice from the animal kingdom
Yes, even at our most well-behaved, we’re still
animals — human animals, but animals nonethe-
less. As a result, the same rules that apply to
the larger animal kingdom sometimes apply to us.
Lionel Tiger, an anthropology professor who has
done a lot of work on animal behavior, reports
that, to show that their intentions are honorable,
animals bare their necks, the most vulnerable
part of any animal’s body. Where do you think
we got the phrase “Go for the jugular (vein)”?
And you thought it came from a Dracula movie.
Therefore, the best way to show how honorable
your intentions are is to bare your neck metaphor-
ically: In other words, to get a phone number, offer
your own.

Giving Your Phone Number
You’ve been enjoying the conversation (or not), have been flattered by the
attention (or not), and now you’re in the spotlight: Your phone number has
been requested or his/her phone number has been offered. Now, whether
you’re wildly euphoric or praying that the floor will open and swallow you
whole, you have to respond.
If someone wants to contact you, you may be tempted to give your phone
number for these reasons:
 You want him or her to get in touch.
 You’re not sure that you’re interested, but you want to keep your
options open.
 You wouldn’t spit on him if he were on fire, but you don’t want to 
appear rude.
The following sections help you maneuver gracefully through these scenarios.
You’d like to see the person again
If you’re interested and want to stay in touch, give out your number, but also
get the other person’s number. If you only give your number and don’t get a

When not to “cell”
Somehow cell phones have allowed folks to forget
basic manners and common sense. If the follow-
ing list of times not to use cell phones doesn’t
seem absurdly obvious and straightforward to
you, you need a basic attitude adjustment. If the
list seems like silly fun and you suspect that my
tongue is parked firmly in my cheek — bingo!
 At a wedding
 At a funeral
 At the altar
 On a date
 During sex
 In the shower
 When comforting someone who is crying
 When celebrating birthdays or anniversaries
 When breaking up
 When making up

number in return, you’re setting yourself up to hang around the phone, wait-
ing for a call. So make a deal. Say, “I’d love for you to have my number, and I’d
love to have yours as well.” Exchanging numbers has the following benefits:
 You can give the other person a jingle if he/she doesn’t call on your
timetable.
 You don’t have to be passive or nasty, just a co-equal. No more waiting
around for a call, and no more fuming because you never heard from
Prince or Princess Charming again.
 If the person turns out to be a bozo, you have something to fantasize
about pasting on bathroom walls — “For a good time, call. . . .” (But
don’t do it! Paybacks can be really harsh.)
You’re not sure whether you’re interested
When you’re not sure that you want the person to call, you can always say
you’re about to change your number because you’ve received too many
hang-ups; the number used to belong to an escort service; or you want a
cuter number.
If you decide that you want to give out your number and then, upon reflection,
decide that it was a mistake, you can get an answering machine or a call block
machine so that you can screen your calls. If it turns out that the person is
more persistent than you’d like, you can change your number.
Another alternative if you’re not sure whether you want to give out your
phone number is to get the person’s number instead. Of course, doing so
means you have to call the person. (See the section “Asking for a Number”
earlier in this chapter to find out why.)
Don’t ask for a phone number as a defensive measure, as in, “I don’t want you
to have my number, but if I ask for yours, you’ll be less intense about getting
mine.” Then you’re just being creepy.
No way, Jose
If there is no way that you’d ever want to see this person again, don’t be
tempted to give your number. Doing so may be easy for the short term, but it
actually makes the situation more uncomfortable because you’ll end up caus-
ing yourself and the other person heartache not very far down the line. Even
though it’s difficult, it’s better not to mislead them or give false hope. If
you’re not interested, be (gently) upfront about it and say, “Listen, I’m going
to be very busy,” or “You’re very nice, but I’m going through a tough time
102
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

right now,” or “I’m about to move,” or “I’m joining the French foreign legion.”
The main point is don’t give someone your number if you don’t want the person
to call you.
Don’t you dare give a wrong number (and yes, deliberately mixing up any two
numbers in the sequence counts as a wrong number) or your mom’s — or
your best friend’s or an old boyfriend’s — number. Come on, this is dating,
not terrorism.
Home phone or not?
Many women are reluctant to give out home numbers for safety’s sake and
are much more willing to give out work numbers because they’re not alone at
work and they (generally) work during the day. Work phone numbers create
their own problems, however:
 At work other people are around, which feels safer, but it’s also less 
private.
 Many if not all businesses frown on personal calls during the workday. If
you’ve been given or are giving out a work number, understand that the
conversations have to be shorter than they would be if you were using a
home number.
Of course, not all home phone numbers automatically eliminate these prob-
lems. Sharing your home phone number with roommates or family can limit
the length of the calls. If the phone has extensions, you may find that you
restrict the content as well because you never know who may be listening in.
Life-saving cells
When it comes to dating, cell phones are really lifesavers, allowing you to
remain coy about home and work numbers. Giving out a home number is
giving an awful lot of information to a stranger. Giving a work number may com-
promise you at work because when they call, the timing may be unfortunate
due to lack of privacy, running afoul of company policy, or any one of a number
of constraints. An operator or a voice mail may identify the name and/or
address of your workplace, which may be more information than you want a
stranger to have about you initially. Ta-da — cell phones to the rescue! Among
other things, cell phones have caller ID and are mobile, thus not identifying any
geographical location where you can be found. The disadvantage of a cell over
a land line is you can’t block a cell number, but you know who it is before you
have to answer. Also, if someone is sneaky enough to use “restricted,” you can
just let it ring through to voice mail. In a worst-case stalker scenario, it’s a lot
easier to change your cell phone number than your home or office phone.
103
Chapter 9: Getting a Phone Number

As long as we’re talking cell phones, just a note of caution here: If there’s
somebody in your life who has access to your cell phone bill, your entire life
will be laid out, chapter and verse. Ma Bell has single handedly wiped out
adultery as we know it with the combination of itemized bills, star (*) 69, and
caller ID.
Phone number alternatives
There are a number of ways to give out a phone number without actually
giving out a phone number:
 I’m listed. If you want the person to get in touch, make sure you’ve
made the listing clear as it appears in the phone book. In many cases,
though, directing someone to the phone book means you’ve given out
your home address as well. You can be a bit suaver but if your name is
hard to spell, you may have blown the deal.
 Business card. A business card usually has a work phone number, often
a fax number, a business address, and an e-mail address.
If you don’t have a business card, for very little money, you can have one
printed up that gives out whatever information you want to share. (You
can usually get around 500 business cards for between $15 and $25 or
less.) If you are self-employed or work at home, having a business card
can make you feel a little more professional as well.
 Home address. Giving out a home address is a bit risky. Of course,
sooner or later, if the two of you hook up, you’re very likely to exchange
home addresses. The question is, sooner or later? My advice is later —
when you’re sure this is someone you trust to behave respectfully and
appropriately after he or she knows where you live. If you have even the
most minor inkling that this person may surprise you by lurking on your
doorstep, trust your instinct for heaven’s sake, and don’t give out your
address.
 E-mail. For many folks, giving out an e-mail address is a safer alternative
than giving out a phone number. Of course, you have to balance your
sense of safety and your need for intimacy. I may be old-fashioned, but I
think that actually hearing a voice is a nice way to begin to connect with
someone.
Decoding Girl Time versus Boy Time
Girl time is quite different from boy time. When a guy asks for a girl’s number,
she assumes that means he’s going to call on the way home from the party.
She checks her machine twice an hour, has the phone company check to
104
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

make sure the line is okay, and won’t take a bath for fear she’ll miss the call. If
Mom calls to talk about Dad’s surgery, she’ll politely mention that she’s
expecting an important call and will call back.
Guys, on the other hand, will almost never call on the way home from the
party or even the next day. They think it makes them look too needy. Because
nobody ever calls near a weekend for a first date, the better part of a week
may pass before a guy even thinks about calling. If he left the number at
home or gets busy or gets a cold, well, it may be two weeks before he calls.
By this time, the woman is just plain furious.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
If you really like a woman, it’s okay to call the next day. It’s also okay to make
a date. Just don’t stay on the phone too long and keep the patter light.
Cool your jets a bit. You’ve been smart enough to get his phone number, so
you can wait this one out a while. If he hasn’t called in a week or so and you
want to give him a ring, fine. Just keep the conversation light and short and
don’t ask why he hasn’t called.
Talking Once You’re on the Phone
Talking on the phone is a nice way to begin getting to know one another. It’s
personal without being overly intimate: You’re at arm’s — or, literally, at
phone’s — length from one another.
During the first conversations, keep things short and casual. Those let’s-put-
the-phone-on-the-pillow-and-listen-to-each-other-breathe-as-we-fall-asleep
things come much, much later. So don’t worry about the sweaty palms (as
long as the phone doesn’t slip), don’t hang up, and don’t try too hard.
Never make a date with a machine. Whether it’s the first date or the fiftieth,
unless it’s an emergency, get in touch with the person mouth to ear so that
you know the message has been received loud and clear.
Rules in a Nutshell
The following are the rules for getting, giving, and using phone numbers:
 If you want a number, ask and be willing to offer your own.
 If you don’t want to see the person again, don’t ask for a number and
don’t give a number.
105
Chapter 9: Getting a Phone Number

 If you’re not sure, build a time frame into your response so that nobody
is sitting around waiting for you to call.
 Exchanging phone numbers is the fun, easy part, so relax a bit and don’t
get too involved before you’ve even had a first date. It’s not worth the
stomach acid.
 Calling and hanging up is not okay; neither is driving by. All states now
have anti-stalking laws, and they are enforced (see Chapter 27 for infor-
mation on stalking). Playing games can get you into serious trouble, so
don’t be silly here. Plus, caller ID has made hang-ups traceable. You don’t
need police on your doorstep as part of your dating experience.
In a nutshell, a phone is quicker than pony express, less traumatic than a
telegram, more personal than e-mail, more fun than smoke signals, and the
first major step toward moving from strangers to something much bigger and
better.

AAARGH!
If this is how you envision a first date, add “disappointment,” “ulcers,” and
“financial ruin” to your list, because you’re setting yourself up for disaster.
The ideal first date should let you get to know the other person and let the
other person get to know you, without doing irreparable damage to your ner-
vous system — or bank account or stomach lining — in the process.
First Things First
A first date may never be a relaxing experience (after all, no matter how
down-to-earth you are, you’ll still worry about the broccoli in your teeth), 
but it doesn’t have to be ulcer material either. This section outlines the basic
rules. In fact, these rules are so basic, they sound silly, but you’d be surprised
how often they’re disregarded, with dire consequences. So a word to the wise:
To make your first date as comfortable as possible, follow the ten rules out-
lined in the following sections. Doing so will increase the probability that
you’ll have fun — not teeth-clenching, knuckle-biting, stomach-hurting agony
that may (or may not) get you to either date two or heavy sedation.

Rule 1: Pick an activity that you enjoy
A first date should be something that you like to do. Do not pick something
you hate just because you think your partner will enjoy it. Although this may
be a good strategy later on, the goal during the first date is to set the tone. If
you choose something you like, at least you have that in common with your
date (presuming, of course, that your date accepted the invitation because
he or she likes the activity, too). If your date hates the idea, hopefully he or
she will say something like “I really would like to spend time with you, but I
hate jazz” or “I’m allergic to Chinese food” or “I get claustrophobic (car sick
or whatever) in submarines.”
Picking something you enjoy has a few advantages: First, it ensures that at
least one person will be having a good time. Second, it offers an insight into
who you are — you know, that honesty thing. Third, it means that you’ve set
the stage for something you can afford — since only a phony or a masochist
or a nincompoop would break his or her own bank on a first date.
Rule 2: Pick an activity that
you can easily afford
Don’t try and snow somebody on the first date by spending gobs of money.
First of all, how do you keep that type of spending up? The dangers of throw-
ing money around are that it makes you look cheap later, when you scale
back your spending to accommodate your budget, and you never know
whether your date likes you or your wallet. Also consider your date’s finances
before suggesting an exclusive new restaurant, any formal event, dinner and
dancing, or a weekend for two in the Bahamas. Even if you are footing the bill,
you don’t want your date to feel like she’s out of your league.
I have a friend who likes to rent a limo and take first dates to the opera and
then out for a fancy dinner. All this works out to a $500 first date. Then he
wonders why women are always using him. Puh-leeeze. It’s much better to
start small and build so that your date assumes you’re more invested in both
of you together instead of showing off.
Rule 3: Do something that doesn’t
require new clothes
New clothes are often uncomfortable, and can unexpectedly bunch, rip, or
gap. Besides, why add the worry about spilling red wine on your new outfit to
the other stress of a first date? Why worry about clothes when there are
108
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

more important things to worry about, like the broccoli between your front
teeth or whether your date really likes you or is just being polite. Wear your
happy, easy-to-wear, good luck, appropriate-to-wear clothes.
If I ran the world, I’d make sure that on first dates, everyone would wear his
or her oldest, most comfy clothes; women would not shave their legs; men
would not buy new after-shave; and all men and women would be who they
really are, right from the get-go. Obviously, I’m not in charge. Shoes should
always be shined, cuffs unfrayed, and everything neat and clean — not rigid,
new, starched, and impressive.
Rule 4: Go where you can talk
without getting thrown out
I know America’s favorite date is a movie, but if you talk in a movie, I will per-
sonally come and haunt you. Not only is it rude to the other customers, but it
puts your date in the awkward position of either siding with the people who
are trying to shush you, or talking with you and getting the usher to evict you
both. See the section “Good places for a first date,” later in this chapter, for a
list of places that are cheap and fun and where you two can chat happily
away. When in doubt, take a walk.
Rule 5: Go to a place that’s easy to get to
Long car, bus, train, and — God forbid — plane trips may be fun once you get
to know one another, but for a first date, it’s really risky. Although these trips
have occasionally worked out as a way for two people to get to know one
another (at least you can talk), you run the risk of using up your tolerance for
one another before you arrive at your destination, and then, boy, are you both
stuck. If you’d just gotten to know each other in smaller doses, however, you
may have been okay.
Rule 6: Do something that isn’t 
competitive
Avoid arm wrestling on the first date. Although some relationships thrive on
tension, it’s hard to put competitive feelings in a context when you don’t know
each other. Even if you’re not competing with each other, how you deal with
someone trying to beat you while the date you’re trying to impress is watching
gets pretty dicey. Beating someone on a first date means that one of you feels
like a winner and one like a loser. Not a cool idea.

Chapter 10: Plotting the Place for Your First Date

I walk fast. For years it was my primary form of exercise, and I still use it to
keep in shape. When I say fast, I mean fast. Often, without realizing it, I’ve left
my companions no choice but to carry on a conversation with the back of my
head. Oops. The point is that different people are comfortable with different
levels of activity. Bear this in mind before you suggest a Saturday hike,
rollerblading, break dancing, or bungee jumping from a hovering helicopter.
Rule 7: Pick an activity that doesn’t
involve a lot of alcohol
Alcohol has been, is now, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future
the major drug of abuse in this country (more Pilgrims drowned in the canals
after getting drunk and falling overboard on Saturday nights than were killed
by Native Americans). Both of you are going to feel a bit nervous anyway.
Why add the temptations and problems of alcohol, especially if you have to
drive home?
Rule 8: Leave time to get to know
each other
A date that is chock-full of activity keeps you busy, but if the purpose is a
chance to get to know one another, some quiet time is a great idea. Without a
bunch of distracting noise, activity, or an audience, you can talk to and get a
sense of one another.
Rule 9: Do something that doesn’t
involve high-ticket others
High-ticket others include friends, family, exes, kids, animals, or colleagues.
Audiences are fine if you’re an actor giving a performance. They are tricky
if you’re trying not to perform and just be, which is the point of a date. If
your first date involves your parents, sibs, workmates, or people who know
you and love you, the date is going to feel like an audition. You don’t need
other people’s opinions at this point. (If you don’t have enough confidence
in your abilities and think you do need the opinions of a bunch of other
people, you ought not to be dating yet.) Later on, when the two of you
know each other and feel a bit more solid, showing each other off and 
getting feedback from your friends (always a bit dicey) may be cool, but
for heaven’s sake, not yet.
110
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

Rule 10: Find an activity that doesn’t
last more than a couple of hours
Brevity is not only the soul of wit, but it is also the essence of a good date. In
Chapter Two, a Neil Simon play, the male lead (played by James Caan in the
movie version) tells the female lead (played by Marsha Mason), after a ten-
minute introduction, that he’s really enjoyed their time together and thinks
it’s time to plan a second date. He leaves and knocks on the door. When she
answers, the two begin their second date, much more relaxed.
The key is to leave ’em wanting more. If you both had a good time, you’ll both
eagerly anticipate date two. If one or the other of you didn’t have a good
time, keep in mind that one of the ways to limit the damage is to limit the
time. If the date was only mildly troublesome and not prolonged agony, you
may well recover and be willing to try a second date.
Exploring First Date Ideas
Some places and events lend themselves to successful first dates, and others
practically scream, “What could I be thinking?!” To help you tell one from the
other — would you believe that Valentine’s Day is a first date no-no? — read
the following sections.
If your first date is fun and relaxed, you’re home free. Worst-case scenario,
you may end up friends rather than potential lovers, but a casual approach
decreases the probability that the two of you will be unhappy enough with
each other to end up enemies.
Places and things to avoid
Following are occasions and places you want to avoid as a first date. As a
rule, these events create unrealistic expectations and involve too many 
other people. If it’s fireworks you want, get thee to a wienie roast in a gasoline
jumpsuit.
 Wedding: Going to a wedding as a first date violates just about every
single one of the ten basic rules listed earlier. If you want to quibble
about Rule 6 (Do something that isn’t competitive), are you really so
naïve as to think your date isn’t trying to figure out how to beat you out
111
Chapter 10: Plotting the Place for Your First Date

the door when the ceremony’s over? The stakes are just too high at wed-
dings. Avoid them at all costs as a first date. In fact, because weddings
are such a bad idea for a first date, I’ve made it the standard by which all
other bad first date ideas are judged.
 New Year’s Eve party: Oh, puh-leeeze, New Year’s Eve is the scariest
night of the year for a first date. New clothes, high expectations, lots of
booze, high-ticket others — consider this a mini-wedding. Just about the
only thing it lacks is a weeping mother-in-law and a crazy uncle who
thinks the ladies’ room is the coat check. On second thought, it just
lacks the mother-in-law.
 Valentine’s Day: Valentine’s Day has all the anxiety-producing elements
of a wedding, all the over-blown expectations of New Year’s, plus the
paper-Cupid-induced hope of true Romance. Valentine’s Day is so poten-
tially explosive that even couples who’ve been together for years
approach it warily.
 Thanksgiving dinner: Think of how many traumas you’ve experienced at
your family’s Thanksgiving get-togethers: Uncle Harry getting plastered;
Sister Susie crying into the crystallized yams; brother George coming 
out; Mom burning the turkey; and cousin Jim wanting to bring the TV to
the table to watch football. Even if your family doesn’t behave like this
(what, you’re from Pluto?), it still violates Rule 9 (Don’t involve high-
ticket others) big time. In short, Thanksgiving is truly a family holiday —
all the more reason to avoid it as a first date.
 Beach: Although a great date for later on, the beach isn’t first date stuff:
too much skin, do you or don’t you apply suntan lotion, and if you do, to
what and to whom? A first date on the beach also violates Rule 5 (Go
to a place that’s easy to get to), Rule 10 (Find an activity that doesn’t last
more than a couple hours), and often Rule 3 (Do something that doesn’t
require new clothes).
So-so ideas
The ideas in this section, although very common, aren’t necessarily your best
choice for a first date. Of course, they aren’t your worst choice either.
 Movies or plays: On the not-so-good-as-a-first-date side, going to the
movies or a play doesn’t give you much of an opportunity to talk, and if
your tastes differ, you may have a hard time finding a show that pleases
you both. On the other hand, having seen the same movie or play gives
you something to talk about afterward, and, well, it is kinda fun sitting
together in the dark worrying about whether or not to hold hands. It can
also give you time to calm down a bit before you actually have to talk to
or look at each other.
112
Part III: Setting Up the Date 

Make sure your date hasn’t already seen the planned event or loathes
the genre. If you plan to go risky — horror flick, avant garde perfor-
mance piece, or nude review — check with your date or save the shock
technique for date four or five.
 Dinner: A dinner out is a classic, but as the focus of a date, there is too
much potential for an upset tummy: deciding what kind of food, the
potential to spill, and that old broccoli-in-the-teeth thing, for starters. If
you’re not the one footing the bill, figuring out what to order that’s not
too expensive is also a challenge. If you’re going to eat, make it a side
activity rather than the date itself, or try a casual approach rather than
the Ritz. Any place that has headwaiters is going to be too expensive,
emotionally as well as financially. See the section “Doing the restaurant
thing,” later in this chapter, for more info.
 Party: How good a party is as a first date depends on who’s hosting the
party and where it is. If your date will be the only person who doesn’t
know everyone, and you don’t know your date, it’s a bit tricky. My
advice is to make other plans for your first date. Of course, going to a
party is a great date for later on.
Good places for a first date
Following are the cream of the first-date-ideas crop: All can feel wholesome
and nonthreatening during the day and only slightly sexier after dark.
 Museums: At a museum, you get to meander through the halls, look at
exhibits, and chat about anything that inspires you. It’s a great place to
get to know each other and to see each other’s tastes in art — or what-
ever. Also, most museums are usually easy to get to and offer a place to
eat (even if overpriced for what you’re getting, they won’t break the
bank). A museum is relaxed, easy, and inexpensive and doesn’t bump
into any of the ten rules for first dates.
 Amusement park: Unless it’s really hard to get to, going to an amuse-
ment park is usually fun and makes everybody feel young and carefree.
The only real problems? Sticky fingers from cotton candy and rides that
make you so queasy you’d give up your firstborn for an antacid tablet,
but all-in-all, a good choice.
 Walks: You can take walks (almost) anywhere: parks, zoos, botanical
gardens, and so on. It’s cheap, fun, and pressure-free. Plus, you can often
hold hands.
 Street fair: You’re outside, nothing costs very much, you’re around
other people, and there are a lot of things to talk about. In the winter,
you can substitute county fairs, car shows, boat shows, antiques shows,
113
Chapter 10: Plotting the Place for Your First Date

and even zoos and botanical gardens, all places where you can move
around, nothing is very expensive, you’re outdoors, and you can talk
without interrupting people.
 An auction: An auction is a fun date as well as long as you don’t get car-
ried away and resist the temptation to bid. I actually had a great time at
both a livestock auction and a farm machinery sell-off although I did buy
a cow at the former once for a guy I was seeing — but that’s another
story.
 Outdoor activities in general: Sporting events, concerts, county fairs,
zoos, and picnics are great ideas for first dates. You can talk, and
because you’re outside, everything feels less claustrophobic. It’s easy
and relaxed, and figuring out what to wear usually isn’t a problem.
 Miscellaneous indoor events: When the weather turns ugly, consider
car shows, boat shows, art shows, antiques shows, planetariums, and
aquariums. You can talk to each other with no worries about being
shushed!
It may seem that in a big city there are more options, but an awful lot of people
that live in big cities don’t know how to act like tourists. Don’t assume that if
you are living in a small town that there is nothing to do. Even if you live in a
small town, my guess is that there is an obscure museum or park that you
haven’t been to, a historic monument, a fun and unusual event, a local sporting
tournament. You can certainly look into special exhibits at museums or art
fairs, traveling carnivals or dances work too, because what you want a first
date to be is a little unusual, a little fun, but not to make either one of you feel
uncomfortable. If you know everyone in town, what you may want to do is go
to the next town over so you don’t feel like your first date will appear in the
local gazette. There is no such thing as an area that doesn’t have special
events, and what you need to do is become a little bit like a detective and look
in the Friday or Saturday paper and see if there is an art festival going on, or if
you live in a college town find out if there is something going on at the school.
Don’t assume that you’ve done everything that there is to do; I guarantee that
with a little bit of energy and ingenuity you’ll find something remarkable.

Part III: Setting Up the Date 
Proust, present, and future: A film moment
On a first date from hell, a guy took me to
Remembrance of Things Past, a film, based on
the Proust novel, that had full frontal nudity
(both male and female) and was nearly unintel-
ligible other than body parts. My date and I both
just sat there blushing, with our eyes glued to
the screen, afraid to even acknowledge the
presence of the other. Tough stuff for a first date
if you can’t make eye contact after the movie
due to the subject matter. Sigh.

Doing the restaurant thing
Going out to eat is one of the most common first date activities. But it doesn’t
have to be routine. To make your date a notch above ordinary, put a spin on
the restaurant theme:
 Go to a coffeehouse. Unless you’re meeting at a Starbucks and ordering
two grande skim lattes and roasted pepper and goat cheese sandwiches
(which is about the same price as the national debt), compared to a 
traditional restaurant, this is a pretty cheap date. It’s the ’90s version
of a singles bar: relaxed, casual, and no time pressure.
 Go to an interesting restaurant. Food is good. Good food is even
better. Good, unusual food is the best and often less pricey than the
usual, boring steak or fried chicken. It doesn’t have to be the culinary
experience of your life, but fun and interesting food (maybe ethnic,
but easy on the spices) on a first date is a cool idea. I’m partial to 
weekend lunch and brunch dates, myself. It’s relaxed, liquor’s not
required, there’s plenty of time to get to know each other, and it’s in
the daytime.
Food can be incredibly sexy and fun, as Hollywood readily attests: Rent
the videos Like Water for Chocolate, Babette’s Feast, Big Night, or even 
91⁄2 Weeks.
There are some way cool ways to enhance the enjoyment of a restaurant
date. First, for any restaurant you consider, think about the following:
 Noise level: You got together so that you can get to know each other. It
makes sense to be able to hear what your date has to say and talk with-
out seriously harming your vocal chords.
 Price: Go to a place you can afford. You can’t enjoy yourself if you worry
about your date ordering an appetizer and a dessert.
 Service: You want the service to be attentive, without hovering. And
who wants to be rushed out the door?
 Spaciousness: Adequate space is an animal need (see the related side-
bar, “You’re invading my space” in this chapter). That’s why we all feel a
little uneasy in a packed elevator or an overcrowded restaurant.
 Lighting: You don’t want it too dark or too light. Too dark and he can’t
see the great job you did on your makeup, or she won’t notice that your
tie matches your eyes; too light, and no matter what you did, you’ll still
end up looking like a delivery to the morgue.
115
Chapter 10: Plotting the Place for Your First Date

After you narrow your list of potential restaurants down to those that meet
your economic and ambiance requirements, narrow the list down even more
by doing the following:
 Pick a place you know. Menu familiarity reeks of confidence. You’ll
sound like Cary Grant if you lean over and say, “Try the duck. It’s out of
this world.” Also, knowing a restaurant well means that you’re comfort-
able with the service, the all-important table spacing, the lighting, the
wine list, the taste, the presentation, and payment procedures. It’s the
way to ensure you’ll have a good time. And if you’re happy, your date
stands a better chance of being happy, too.
Avoid trendy new hot spots. Number one, they are often very difficult to
get into, and number two, they can be very expensive — you don’t want
to put your MasterCard into meltdown. Number three, these days, they
tend to be noisy! It isn’t the type of place you want to be on a first date.
Save the trendy, expensive hot spots until the two of you know each
other better. Scout out some very nice quiet restaurants that will not
keep you waiting. Getting drunk at the bar while waiting for your table
will not make you look suave. Another added advantage of by-passing
the bar wait is that you’ll find yourself with money left over for your col-
lege education or braces on your eventual children’s teeth. Most impor-
tantly, make it someplace quiet where you can talk.
 Pick a place that knows you. What could be cooler than a maitre d’ smil-
ing widely when you walk in or a waiter saying, “Nice to see you again!”?
Better, though, is the fact that regulars usually get the best tables and
most prompt service — both of which go a long way in creating a great
first date.
116
Part III: Setting Up the Date 
You’re invading my space
Reconnaissance is valuable: Scout out the
locale to make sure that you’re closer to your
date than the dude at the next table. Turf counts.
Like all other cultures, Americans have well-
defined territorial areas:
 Intimate space is about 18 inches away
from our heads. According to anthropolo-
gist Edward Hall, you’ll only let close com-
panions and pets into this private area for
any stretch of time.
 Personal space is two to four feet all around
us. Friends are allowed in this space, but
that’s it.
 Social space expands to about four to eight
feet away. Co-workers or acquaintances at
a party are invited in.
 Public space is all areas beyond.

 Pick a place where your date can eat. There’s the obvious (don’t take a
vegetarian to a steak house) and the more subtle (if his cholesterol
count is above 300, steer clear of the Wisconsin Cheese Fest). Chances
are, unless you already know each other well, you won’t know the intri-
cacies of your date’s dietary preferences. Simple solution: Ask ahead of
time. Less simple: Keep everyone’s options open by selecting neutral
territory, such as a restaurant with a large menu or a coffeehouse with a
small one.
Who Pays?
In deciding who pays for the date, follow this two-part rule:
 The person who asks, pays. This ensures that whoever does the inviting
knows what things will cost and has budgeted accordingly. As the
person extending the invitation, if you can’t afford the activity, scale
down and figure out something else to do.
 The other person offers but doesn’t insist on helping out. No empty
gestures please. Don’t offer to pay unless you can and are willing to do
so. No fights to the death. It’s charming to offer, but don’t push it, and be
willing to treat next time.
117
Chapter 10: Plotting the Place for Your First Date
My part of the bill is . . .
Used to be easy figuring out who paid, because
men paid for everything (of course, they were
the only ones doing the asking), and women
kept their mad money tucked neatly in their little
velvet purses and paid for nothing. Of course,
after so many eons of men feeling that they had
to pay and women feeling that men expected
something for their money, women got a bit
more aggressive about paying their share
(rather than being fearful that the guy would
“take it out in trade”). But it gets pretty tedious
figuring out what your fair share is when you
order the salad and your date orders the prime
rib, and you still have to figure in the tip.
My solution was to play liar’s poker, which is a
game played with the serial number on dollar
bills in which bluffing is allowed until you are
called. Whoever lost had to pay for dinner. I got
really good at offering and really good at liar’s
poker, which seemed to cover all bases.
These days, it’s okay to offer to pay the tip, buy
the popcorn, pay for the next date, bring the
picnic, pay for the gas, and so on, not only on
the first date but as an ongoing statement of
equality, friendliness, and generosity unless it
drives your date nuts.

In this part . . .
I
t’s been said that God is in the details. While that may
or may not be true, I can guarantee that successful
date preparation certainly is. No matter how many dates
you’ve had in your life, each new D-Day is a big day.
Feeling a bit nervous, excited, giddy, hopeful, and scared
is par for the course. Pretending it’s just another ho-hum
Saturday night can be a recipe for disaster — or at least
lost potential, which can feel even worse.
This part will help you chill out, get ready, and plan to
have a fabbo time. I’m gonna hold your hand, help you get
dressed, give you a last-minute checklist, a rundown of
things to talk about (and things to avoid like the plague),
and a bunch of quickie relaxation techniques to tide you
over until you’re relaxed enough and confident enough to
fly solo.

T
hink of the astronauts suiting up for launch, your first day of school, the
moment just before the curtain rises — we’re talking the thrill of possibil-
ity, and with it, adrenaline, anticipation, action. Even though your palms get
sweaty and your tummy may hurt a bit, you feel alive and ready, especially if
you’ve practiced your landing sequence, packed your lunch, and learned
your lines. If so, anticipation is a wonderful thing. It’s the perfect imaginary
meal you can almost taste when your growling tummy notices it’s been a
while since you last ate. It’s the white sands of Tahiti that inspire you to see
your boss about that raise, the bacon you can see sizzling when that first
whiff wakes you up in the morning.
If you handle it right, anticipation is not only a motivating factor (“I think I’ll
call a friend for lunch, write a memo to my boss, haul myself out of bed”) but
also a way to enjoy an experience twice: You can enjoy it in your imagination,
and you enjoy it again when it’s real. That’s really good news. An emotional
twofer. Two for the price of one. The not-so-good news is that anticipation
can backfire if you’re careless with the way you handle it.
It’s up to you: You can poison a neutral or even positive situation by being
negative, by building up the dreaded worst-case scenario. Or you can choose
to be delighted about your upcoming date and focus on doing what you can
to make things click. You can choose to label your nerves “excitement” and
look forward to having a great time.

Once you’ve decided to enjoy the tingle rather than let your nerves become
hives, the adrenaline-jazzed anticipatory period before your first date is the
perfect time to get yourself, your mind, your body, and your soul into the
“date state.”
In this chapter, referring to “date state” focuses not on cosmetic surgery
before a first date (can you say overkill) or why your wardrobe doesn’t need
an immediate major overhaul but why your teeth, hair, and pits need to be
squeaky clean. It also includes advice on what and what not to wear. Time,
transportation, money, and directions require the same attention before you
head out. Finally, tada, a handy checklist of smart things to do during those
final ten minutes before your date arrives.
Considering Cosmetic Improvements
Before we focus on the prosaic of what you can do to get your outside ready,
let’s talk for a moment about a rather alarming, expensive trend: the idea that
somehow a person is not going to be lovable unless completely and forever
wrinkle and cellulite free, gorgeous, and hard-bodied with an adorable
upturned nose and a full head of luxuriant hair. Okay, before you accuse me
of being hopelessly old-fashioned, if you have a bump on your nose that
you’ve always hated and you’re deciding that now you have the time and the
money to get it fixed, so be it. It’s cool with me. But if you think changing that
bump on your nose is going to help you find love, forget about it. You’re likely
to be disappointed in not only your nose job but the rest of your life.
Plastic surgery is no longer only for movie stars and international socialites;
today people in all socioeconomic classes are undergoing cosmetic surgery.
The largest number of people getting plastic surgery make less than $30,000
dollars a year, which I find vaguely terrifying. If you want to have plastic
surgery, it’s okay with me, but please don’t do it to increase your chances of
finding a date. If you want to think about a chemical peel to make your skin
look better, no problem, but it won’t make you more lovable or a better con-
versationalist or less angry with your mom while looking for a date. If a cos-
metic surgery procedure — or Botox injections or hair replacement
treatments — makes you feel better, so be it, but if your entire sense of self is
based on the smoothness of your skin or more hair, we need to talk.
Before you decide that I’m the spokesperson for ugly, I’m the first to admit
that confidence is attractive and that a good haircut, a flattering outfit, or
gaining or losing a couple of pounds can boost your confidence. Well, terrific,
and I am actually in favor of a couple of new cosmetic procedures that are rel-
atively inexpensive, noninvasive, and easily available, including those that lit-
erally put your money where your mouth is: tooth whitening or, if the enamel
122
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

is hugely discolored, veneers for your teeth, both of which are becoming
more popular and both affordable and available. One of the top turn-offs for
both men and women is bad teeth. If you haven’t had those choppers looked
at and cleaned recently, start with a routine checkup and cleaning; it’s cheap-
est, easiest, and healthiest place to start. If you’re feeling that your smile isn’t
as vibrant as you like, teeth whitening is a relatively inexpensive and
common procedure. Inner beauty is truly something that may need work and
can’t be bought, but giving Ma Nature a minor shove in the smile department
is quite kosher.
First Impressions Count
You can visually absorb someone’s appearance in two seconds. Two seconds!
Talk about your once-over. That’s exactly what’s going to happen in the
vibrating, potential-packed few moments between the time you open the
door, flash those pearly whites, and say “Hi.” Ba-da bing, ba-da boom. An
impression has already been burned into your date’s brain, so you may as
well make sure it’s a great one. Even if you’ve seen each other before, the
context has changed. Now it’s official. It’s a date.
That two-second stare, called the copulatory gaze, triggers a primal reaction in
the person being gawked at: advance or pull back. It’s a biologically buzzed
moment. Pupils are dilated, and heart rates are up. Staring too long is threaten-
ing, so take it easy. Take a look and then look away before your date runs away.
Suiting Up
Because your date evaluates your appearance from the outside in, I’m start-
ing with the least important part of you, but the most important part of an
initial impression: how you look — what you’re wearing, how you smell, your
haircut.
What you wear — your “costume” — counts. A person dressed as a clown is
seen as silly; a clown dressed as a judge is taken seriously. Think about the
clichés that apply: You are what you wear. Clothes make the man. Beauty is in
the eye of the beholder. There’s a reason these clichés, hackneyed as they are,
stick. Though everyone hates to admit it, we’re an externally-oriented soci-
ety. So expecting (hoping, praying, making a deal with the dating gods) that
your date will look beyond your favorite sneakers with the toe hole or that
muumuu you bought at the souvenir hut in Hawaii, to the deep, spiritual, real
you hidden within is spitting into the wind. In other words, you’re all wet. Get
over it. Looks matter . . . no matter how much you wish they didn’t.

Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready

You can do something quickly and easily without working out, consulting a
plastic surgeon, or spending a fortune. The place to start is with your own
sense of yourself — your personal style — your statement about yourself.
Yeah, you do have one. Your handwriting, laugh, and sleep position are all
uniquely you. Guess what? Creating an external, aware style can be really fun.
See Chapter 2 for tips on developing and revealing your own style.
When you think about what you plan to wear on your date, keep the following
points in mind:
 Comfort is key. Even if your attire makes a fabulous first impression,
avoid any outfit that pinches, binds, rides up, or threatens to burst at
the seams. Believe in the Law of Murphy: All these things can and will
happen at the worst possible moment.
 Plan to perspire. Even the coolest cat sweats on a date. Even in winter.
It’s nature’s way of lowering your overheated body temperature. Choose
clothes that are loose in the armpits and on the back. Let air get in there
and dry you out before the fabric presses to your flesh like a wet tissue.
 Save the skin show. Your date doesn’t need to know if you’re an innie or
an outie just yet — unless, of course, your date is at the beach (see
Chapter 10).
 A date is about getting to know you, not your outfit. Yes, what you
wear is right up there with remembering to brush your teeth, but if the
first thing he sees is your ostrich feather, or she has to don sunglasses
to look at your day-glo polyester pants, your outfit may never be asked
out on a second date.
 Avoid “get-ups.” If your mother would dub your date outfit a “get-up”
(as in, “You’re going out in that get-up?”), play it safe and get up and get
something else on. Moms, after all, do occasionally know best. This is no
time to test the truth of the theory.
Now is the time to control your urge to splurge. I know it’s tough. (My
favorite four-letter word is “sale.”) But beware of the 50-percent trap (if you
wouldn’t buy it for full price, don’t buy it at half price). Ostensibly, this is the
first of many dates. You don’t want to rope yourself into a lifetime of revolv-
ing debt or watch your date’s face fall after your horsemen have turned back
into mice and your carriage is one big fat pumpkin again.
Dressing for real-world dates
When it actually comes time to choose an outfit, what do you put on? Well, if
it were up to me, everybody would have a first date in their grubbiest, most
comfortable clothes (grubby in terms of well-worn, not dirty). Men wouldn’t
shave, and women’s legs would remain bristly, and new clothes wouldn’t
124
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

even be contemplated. This non-dress code (or dress non-code) would com-
plement the activities planned, which, if it were up to me, would be active
and fun and casual. None of this fancy restaurant stuff, worrying about prices
and the right fork and not dribbling and stray bits of broccoli between your
teeth and a snooty waiter and tight shoes or collars or tables. But, since I’m
not in charge of the universe, I promise to help you get through getting
dressed for your date in the real world.
Understand that no one, not even cute little ol’ me, can or should tell you
exactly what to wear on a first, second, or fifth date. You already know. Just
trust yourself. Use that three-pound blob of gray matter sitting atop your
neck (no, you don’t have something large caught between your teeth). In
other words, if you use your head — and not your credit card or your Vogue
or your MTV or your rose-colored glasses or your mom — you’ll look and feel
just fine. But don’t panic. I know it’s hard to keep your head on straight, let
alone your wardrobe pulled together, when you’re prepping for a date. But if
you keep the following in mind, you’ll do just fine:
 Rule 1: Preparation before, comfort during. Worry a lot about what
you’re wearing and how you’re smelling and looking before you leave the
house so that you never have to waste a moment thinking about it after
you’ve left.
 Rule 2: There is no one right way. Creating a look is very different from
the way you would sound out a word or learn to dance or memorize
French verbs. It’s not like “Put your left foot here and your right foot
there.” Dressing yourself up to go out is a recognition of who you are,
your personal style, what you want to say about yourself, how you want
others to see you, and, in a way, a reflection of your unique sense of
yourself. You go, guy. You go, girl. If you’re thinking this is a mini exer-
cise in Relationships 101, you go to the head of the class. You’ve been
paying attention.
A surefire way to make sure you end up in the right outfit is to think about
your outfit in terms of what looks and feels good on you, how appropriate the
outfit is for the activity, how your date is dressing, and so on. The following
sections lead you through this examination.
What do I look good in?
A date is a time for the tried-and-true: the outfit you already know inspires
everyone to ask, “Have you lost weight?” — or the male equivalent, “Have
you been working out?” If you find yourself musing, “You know, I’ve always
wanted to try spandex,” immediately do the following: Drop this book, run to
the bathroom, turn the faucet on cold, and shove your face beneath the icy
stream. If no water is available, a gentle, but firm, slap on both cheeks will do.
Save your experimental urges for dark, stormy nights full of lightning when
you’re trying to jolt a green-faced monster with a giant flat-top back to life.
125
Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready

If you’re not sure what you look good in, put on a potential outfit and stand in
front of your mirror. Then really look at yourself, from head to toe to the back
of your heels. You’ll be tempted to be judgmental. Don’t. This is a time for
honest appraisal, not nit-picking.
If you’re not good at figuring out what looks terrific and what qualifies you for
arrest by the fashion police, ask a best friend to be brutally honest (if one
isn’t handy on the day of the date, do this beforehand). Friends see stuff
you’ve been overlooking for years.
 Select substance over style. Style is great, and great style is truly fabu-
lous. Often though, the latest, latest, latest style is a tad too trendy for
anyone other than the very young and very hungry. Again, go for it only
if it looks good on you.
 Pick the right color. Yeah, I know. You guys aren’t about to hold an
orange scarf up to your face to tell whether you really are an “autumn”
instead of a “winter.” I don’t blame you. Who needs the devastation of

Just an average quiz
What would you say is the average height and weight of the average American man or woman?
The average height of a man is
The average height of a woman is
a. 6'
a. 5'6''
b. 5'10''
b. 5'5''
c. 5' 9''
c. 5'4''
The average weight of a man is
The average weight of a woman is
a. 150 pounds
a. 120 pounds
b. 160 pounds
b. 130 pounds
c. 170 pounds
c. 140 pounds
Answer: C . . . for all of them.
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the average man, between 18 and 74, is 5'9''
and weighs 170 pounds; the average woman is about 5'4'' (actually 5'3.7'') and weighs about 140
pounds. The point is, hardly anyone looks like Brad Pitt or Halle Berry. Striving for such an image,
and/or wishing your date would, too, is not only a losing battle but not much fun for either of you.

discovering you’ve spent your life as the wrong season? Yet, a little color
savvy goes a long way. Often, it’s hard to tell if a color really does look
good or the salesperson was pulling your leg when she said, “Puce is
you!” Once again, a trusted friend can come in handy. One quick rule:
If your skin has a yellowish cast to it, you probably look best in soft
browns, golds, and reds. If your skin is more pinkish, try grays, blues,
and purples. When in doubt, hey, there’s always basic black.
 Consider the breadth and scope of the entire date, not just the sashay
to the car or to the table in the restaurant. If there’s dancing after
dinner, for instance, that jacket’s going to come off, so you’d better
make sure it isn’t the cornerstone of your look (or at least that your
shirt is ironed).
 Choose fabrics that wear as well as you do. Satin? Linen?
Fuhgettaboutit unless you’re dating a Shar-Pei who loves wrinkles.
What do I feel good in?
Comfort is crucial. You’ll have enough emotional turmoil to grapple with
without fussing over a shoulder pad that keeps slipping or a silk shirt that
suddenly feels like a plastic bag.
 Select cozy fabrics. Cotton or velvet or any other material that feels soft
against your skin is a good choice.
 Make sure that the fit is fabulous. Take the penny test: Drop a penny
on the floor; then pick it up. If your waistband is too tight, heels too
high, skirt too narrow, slacks too snug, shirt too short, or gold chains
too heavy, rethink your look until you can easily scoop that penny off
the floor. If your outfit doesn’t pass the penny test, put it back in the
closet.
 Wear what you already own. The temptation to rush out and buy the
perfect outfit will be strong. Resist it. You don’t want to take chances
with an outfit that hasn’t already proven itself at least once. “New” 
doesn’t necessarily mean “flawless.” Hems fall, button threads unravel,
perspiration shows. Again, play it safe and go with what you know.
Where am I going?
This point is simple, but often overlooked. Ask yourself, “Did she really
mean it when she said, ‘We’ll grab a bite to eat’?” If so, case closed: Wear a
catcher’s mitt. But if you’re not entirely sure, there’s no harm in asking, “Is
this a casual affair?” — only, leave out the word “affair” so he won’t get the
wrong idea.
127
Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready

Did I pay attention to detail?
Shine your shoes. Press your collar. Check for errant threads. Rub the lipstick
off your teeth. Tuck in the tag. Clean under your fingernails. Sniff for exces-
sive aftershave or perfume. Unstuff your purse. Freshen your breath. Match
your socks. Check out the rearview in a full-length mirror (don’t forget the
back of your hairdo). In short, pretend you’re going to Sunday school and
grandma’s watching.
 Department store dressing rooms are notoriously overlit. If you look
good in there, you’ll look good anywhere.
 Bathroom mirrors are typically underlit for bright, daylight makeup. If
you can, apply daylight makeup close to a window flooded with natural
light. If you can’t, recheck your makeup once you get outside and blend
in any areas that look a little thick.
 Unless you’re covering surgical scars or other major skin care challenges,
you should always be able to see your skin through your makeup.
Foundation is designed to improve Mother Nature, not replace her.
Have I figured my date into the equation?
Dressing for your evening out is primarily about making you feel like a million
bucks, but while you’re at it, throw a few cents of sense your date’s way. Tom
Cruise and anybody aside, most short guys feel a tad shy with an Amazon
woman at their side — especially if he has a bald spot previously seen only
by birds or passengers in low-flying aircraft. Date night may not be the right
night to break out those four-inch heels. Grungy rock stars aside, most

The light fantastic
I was once on a canoe trip with a very beautiful
female friend who arrived for our wilderness
vacation in full makeup: foundation, powder,
shadow, eye liner, lip liner, mascara. The works.
From afar, she looked as gorgeous as ever. Up
close, however, in the blinding glare of sunlight,
she looked a bit like a Kabuki dancer. Once we
got rowing and sweating and sprayed with
white water, her makeup ran faster than two-
dollar pantyhose.
The moral of this story? Lighting is everything.
Makeup is not just makeup. You need to know
how you’ll be seen before you can create the
best look. Before your big date, know how the
setting will be lit and apply makeup accordingly.
This may require a little research, but believe
me, it’s worth it.
If you’re . . . ahem . . . a certain age — and worry
about it — it’s to your distinct advantage to file
a few softly-lit hang-outs in your mind for future
reference. When he asks, “Where would you
like to go?” you can toss off candle-lit venues
with aplomb. Note: There’s nothing wrong with
blowing out that votive candle in the center the
table. Who needs to set a menu on fire?

women prefer a guy who at least ran his fingers through his hair — unless, of
course, he’s been working on the car or in the garden or out in the stables
and his shower is broken. (In that case, the whole date will be a wash, so you
might as well reschedule.) The point is, a date is a twosome. Some considera-
tion on your part can help make it one heck of a great time.
Think about what your date will probably wear. If you’re beaching it, lose the
tie. If you’re going to a barbecue, don’t wear something suitable for a funeral.
Dress age- and place-appropriate so that you’re not likely to be taken for her
father or his baby doll. This is also not the time for gender-bending outfits.
When in doubt, think about both your comfort and your date’s. Remember
that it’s easier to remove a tie than wish you’d worn one, and overdressing
makes you look elegant, and underdressing makes you look sloppy, so if you
can’t hit it exactly right, try a bit over rather than under. My aunt has always
maintained overdressing will get you taken to a better restaurant.
Bearing other factors in mind
Here are a few other things to keep in mind as you prepare:
 Allergies: Many people are sensitive to a whole lot of allergens; it’s no
longer just the cat or dog. One biggie: perfumes and colognes. To some,
wearing a strong scent in a public setting is tantamount to lighting a
giant stogie in a doctor’s waiting room. Play it safe by either going au
naturel or, before you get dressed, spritz your scent into the air and walk
into it instead of squirting perfume or cologne directly on your skin.
 Sore spots: Although you can’t avoid offending all of the people all of the
time, you can avoid stepping on potential toes by considering what your
date may think about fur, cleavage, big hair, smoking, drinking, drugs,
and photographs of Mother pinned to your lapel. Because you don’t
know each other at this point, pretend that you’re dressing for a job
interview or a meeting with a bank to consider a loan. You can make
political statements on date three.

Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready
Thanks, but no thanks
I was once asked out by a guy I had seen at my
gym, who said, “I’ll swing by after I work out.”
Silly me. I pictured a freshly shaved and show-
ered stud, muscles lithe, the glow of endorphins
still rosy on his cheeks. What I got was a
grubby, sweaty grunt who asked whether he
could use my shower. The basketball grime was
still on his hands as he reached out to (unsuc-
cessfully) give me a hug.
“My shower isn’t working,” I said, smiling. “Why
don’t we postpone?” In my nightmares, I can
still see the drip of perspiration dangling from
the tip of his nose — bad first date karma.

Putting together an emergency repair kit
Hey, life happens. But that doesn’t mean you can’t be ready for any eventual-
ity. Keep a shoebox of the following items in your closet at home so you
won’t be searching for them at the last minute, and keep a mini version in
your car or pocketbook for a quick trip to the restroom if necessary.
 Safety pins (small, medium, and large)
 Needle and thread (white, black, and brown)
 Styptic pencil (men and women)
 Extra pair of pantyhose (women)
 Band-Aids
 Clear nail polish to stop a run in pantyhose or repair an earring, a
broken acrylic nail, or loose lens in your glasses
 Hem tape
 Tweezers for that splinter, or a pesky hair that just popped up
 Antacid tablets (optional)
 Breath mints
Cleanliness Is Next to Dateliness
Good hygiene is an essential element of attraction. Most people have five
functioning senses, after all, and use them liberally to evaluate a potential

Profile of the politically correct date: A joke
DON’T
 Drink more than two glasses of red wine . . .
if you drink at all.
 Eat meat (fish and chicken are okay).
 Set your hairstyle with hair spray from an
aerosol can.
 Wear fur, leather, perfume, cologne, or
chemicals of any kind (includes sunscreen
and antiperspirant).
 Discuss politics (unless you met at a rally).
 Call her “babe” or him “sir.”
DO
 Ask for bottled water in the restaurant.
 Discuss whale watching and spotted owl
spotting.
 Praise family values.
 Insist on splitting the check.

mate. In fact, your sense of smell is intimately involved in your choice of a
mate. In essence, proper hygiene is attractive. Or, at the very least, it helps
you avoid being chased by wild dogs and shows that you care not only for
yourself but for others as well.
When you smell an aroma, any aroma, it stimulates the olfactory nerves
which, in turn, activate the limbic, or emotional, center of the brain. Heady
stuff. That’s why certain smells make us feel luscious (think freshly baked
chocolate chip cookies) and other odors make us grimace (think freshly
minted cow patties). Scientists now believe we all have an “odor print,” or
pheromones, that silently lure the opposite sex. These pheromones are
released through natural secretions of the body. Poor hygiene, therefore, can
interfere with our natural “smell” selection.
Don’t sweat it
Sweat is the Stooge Factor. You know, the thing that really separates men
from women. Men love the Three Stooges; women just don’t get it. A few
weeks ago I was loading my sweaty ’tards into a laundry bag at the gym when
a cute fella walked by and started to chat with me. I cautioned him that he
was standing dangerously close to the rather ripe scent of my exercise gear.
He got a dreamy look on his face and said, “Yeah, smells like sweat, baby,
baby.” Like I said, a difference between men and women.

Oral exam
Bad breath is most often caused by:
a. Stomach acid
b. Tongue bacteria
c. Plaque between the teeth
d. Poor oral hygiene
e. Sinus problems
f. All of the above
Answer: b.
Surprised? The latest research on halitosis has
found that by-products of bacteria called Volatile
Sulfur Compounds (VSC), usually found on the
back surface of your tongue, cause nearly all
cases of bad breath. Everyone has these little
devils in their mouths. In fact, they help with
digestion. But the 25 million (yes, million) men
and women with chronic halitosis have an over-
abundance of the critters. No one knows pre-
cisely why, and on D-Day, who cares? The best
temporary solution is a good tongue scraping
after you brush and floss. Then contact a spe-
cialist (breath clinics are popping up in many
places, often associated with dental schools) to
eradicate the problem for life.

Men think sweat is sexy; women think it’s fairly disgusting. Maybe sweat
reminds men of all the sexy ways they can get sweaty, and women get embar-
rassed by the same thoughts. We don’t have to convince one another, but
guys beware: Women find stale sweat smelly and quite uncool. Got it? Good.
Blotting papers, which you can buy in many cosmetic departments, are
handy inexpensive makeup aids to absorb facial oil so you don’t have to
repowder or wash your face and reapply makeup. They also work on sweaty
hands. If you don’t happen to have them with you, not to worry. In most
public bathrooms, those paper toilet seat covers work just beautifully.
(Please use them before you put them on the toilet seat.)
Blotting papers work for you, too!
Hair apparent
At one time, our whole bodies were covered in hair. Hair, once merely a protec-
tion against the harsh elements of nature, is now symbolic of everything from
virility to athletic prowess to financial status to sexuality to sensuality to youth
to creativity to gang affiliation. All for a mass of dead protein cells with emo-
tional impact on the mating ritual we call a date. If your hair looks great, you
feel great. If it resembles road kill, you’ll feel just about as flat and lifeless.

The sweat guide
Sweating, when you’re nervous or hot, is natural.
Excessive sweating, called hyperhidrosis, can be
problematic. It happens when your sympathetic
nervous system is out of whack — working
harder than it needs to in regulating your body
temperature. Sweat appears on the palms of
your hands, your face, feet, and torso, as well as
your pits. Remember the Albert Brooks flop
sweat scene in the movie Broadcast News? No
one wants that to happen on a date. If you sweat
profusely (or even just a little), here are things
that can help:
 Antiperspirants: The active ingredient in
most antiperspirants is aluminum zirconium
trichlorohydrex (or tetra-chlorohydrex) GLY.
Some people do apply antiperspirant to the
soles of their feet or the palms of their
hands, but most use them on their armpits.
The purpose of an antiperspirant is to stop
sweat from reaching the skin. A deodorant,
on the other hand, is used to mask perspi-
ration odors.
 Powders: Brushed on the hands and feet,
talc, cornstarch, and baking soda-based
powders absorb perspiration as it reaches
the surface of your skin.
 Relaxation: Particularly before a big date,
sweat may be more of an emotional
response to stress than a physical problem
with your armpits or hands or forehead. Take
several deep breaths and try to chill out.
 Surgery:In severe cases of sweating, surgery
is possible to remove axillary sweat glands,
or the sweat glands under the arms — but
don’t try this at home.

Women: One way to tell that you’re not ready to go all the way is if you don’t
shave your legs before a big date. Men: One way to tell that you’re not ready
to make out with a woman is if you don’t shave your stubble.
Don’t get a haircut on the day of the date. Men always have a harsh white
scalp line on the back of their necks, and women can’t stop staring at their
hair until they’ve lived with it a day or two. Getting your hair done is a differ-
ent story. If it’s a big date (wedding, formal, dinner at the White House), a
professional do will do quite nicely.
Women lose about as much hair as men do — they just lose it all over their
heads instead of the more obvious pattern of male baldness.
Let your hair dictate the style, not the other way around. Go, literally, with its
flow instead of your own. Your hair will fall into its own place by the end of
the evening anyway, so why fight it?
D-day hygiene checklist
To make sure you covered all the bases, check out this D-day hygiene checklist:
❑Shower.
❑Wash your hair.
❑Wash your ears (inside, out, and behind).
❑Brush and floss.
❑Clip or file your nails (don’t forget your toenails — hey, you never know).
❑Shave (face, legs, armpits). Note: “Hairless” is not a synonym for “clean.”
Personal preference rules.
❑Pluck. (Guys: pay special attention to the bridge of your nose and ear-
lobes; women: don’t skip the chinny chin chin.)
❑Apply deodorant (go for the gold; use an antiperspirant).
❑Wear clean underwear (Mom was right again).
❑Wear freshly laundered clothes.
Taking Care of Business: Practical

133
Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready

Time
Most people have a thing about time. Some people, like me, are always early
and hate being kept waiting. Tardiness can feel really insulting. (I’ve always
been prompt, but being a broadcaster makes me especially careful. If you’re a
minute late, you can lose your job. The “on air” light waits for no one.) Some
people always keep you waiting as a sign of power. They feel important when
they make people wait for them. What’s really important, though, especially
in the beginning of a relationship, is to show consideration for each other and
be on time. It lowers the adrenaline and anxiety in an already tense situation.
For those of you who are always late, remind yourself that you’re late for
your mom or your little brother because you can be. You know they’ll put up
with it. You’re probably not late for your boss, because she won’t put up with
it and will can you. Ask yourself whether you’re using time as a way of arm-
wrestling for attention. If so, figure out a better way to get attention.
Promptness is the courtesy of kings, and isn’t that how we all want to be
treated?
I know it’s considered cool to keep your escort waiting downstairs for your
descent, but think about it: Is it any more acceptable for you to keep him
waiting than for him to keep you on ice? It’s rude and can really throw plans
and stomachs into turmoil.
If you want to make sure you’re on time, try these techniques:
 If you’re not sure where you’re going, plan a dry run the day before.
Getting lost will make you late and nervous.
 If you always tend to be late, give yourself an extra half-hour to get
ready. This is a great idea even if you’re not dating!
134
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 
Time on my side
I once had a business associate who taught me
an incredibly powerful lesson. (She was 6'2'',
which may have had something to do with her
willingness to assert herself.) I took a phone
message for her one evening from someone who
said he was going to be late. The next day, I
asked her whether they had hooked up. She said
no, he was too late. She told me that she would
wait 15 minutes for anyone, but 20 minutes for no
one. Her reasoning was that after 20 minutes,
she was so irritated that she was unfit company.
Hmm, I thought. I think she has something there.
Apparently, so did everyone else. Folks were
always on time for her. Being a broadcaster, I’m
always on time, so people know that if I’m not
there, something has happened, and once I
share this story with tardy friends, it definitely
lessens my waiting time. Which is exactly the
way I want it.

 Decide to be on time. Clocks are simple to read if you actually look at
them.
 Don’t overbook. If you can’t easily make it to the cleaners on your way
home from work so that you have enough time to walk the dog before
you shower, shampoo, shave, and blow-dry your hair, make a later date
or get a cat.
Transportation
No, you don’t have to pick your date up in a stretch limo to be impressive.
What you do need to do is gas up and clean out your car (especially if you
still smoke). Empty the ashtray, wipe down the dash, and pick up the lipstick
that rolls to the front every time you hit the brakes. Use all five senses. If
your auto smells like a locker room, spritz air freshener after you clean up. If
it looks like you pass through a fast food drive-thru each time you hit the
road, vacuum and scan for shriveled french fries and errant ketchup packs in
the crevices beside your seat.
Unless you want your date to think you moonlight as a cab driver, take that
dangling air freshener (and anything else that dangles above your dash) off
the rearview mirror.
Many city folk, some youngsters, and future billionaires who’d rather spend
time in front of a computer screen than behind the wheel don’t have a car. If
you’re in that category, you can do the following:
 Have a (clean, undented) cab waiting.
 Plan to meet at the date destination.
 Rent a car.
 Borrow a car.
 Go somewhere within walking distance.
 Hire a car service for the night.
 Okay, impress your date with a stretch limo (but not on a first date).
There’s no shame to having no wheels. Where a reprimand creeps in, how-
ever, is when the “autoless” treat the “autoed” like chauffeurs. Don’t go there.
Most importantly, don’t make your date go there to pick you up.
Money
The time to swing by the ATM is the day before your date. Nothing kills the
illusion of a together, take-charge person faster than fumbling with your PIN
while your date waits in the car.
135
Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready

If you ask, you pay. So be sure to do the following:
 Stash plenty of cash. If you can’t afford where you’re going, go some-
place else.
 Don’t assume the place you’re going takes credit cards. If you don’t
know (meaning you haven’t called in advance to make sure), bring enough
cash to cover the most expensive item on the menu or at the venue. Or
better, call in advance to both the place and your credit card customer
service to make sure that your card will be accepted there (or anywhere).
 Have a few dollar bills handy for tipping valets, and so on. For a rough
estimate on how much you’ll need for tips, use Table 11-1 as a guide.
Table 11-1
Tipping Guide
Service
Amount of Tip

Directions
Take a deep breath, guys. I’m not going to suggest that you ask for directions.
But, what I will say to both men and women is this: Know where you’re going
and the best way to get there before you pick up your date. In addition, know
how to navigate the location once you arrive: Know where to park the car,
where the front door is, and (if you really want to impress your date) where
the restrooms are.
I know you would never not know where you’re going, but heaven forbid you
get lost and have to look at a map. Until you know each other really well,
beware these seven words: “A map is in the glove compartment.” This seem-
ingly innocent statement sends shivers of fear through otherwise normal
people. Orient the map may mean “find China” to one of you and “get out the
compass and find true north” to the other. One person reading a map while
the other is driving in foreign territory is asking for trouble: One of you help-
lessly watches highway exits whiz by while the other frantically searches for
the name of the city you’re in. If (heaven forbid) you must consult a map, do
136
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

you and your date a favor and pull over, pull the map out, and leave the radio
on something soothing. Never, even when you do know one another really
well, utter these nine words: “Let’s find a gas station and ask for directions.”
One Final Checklist
The best way to appear casual and relaxed is to have done your homework.
The Boy Scouts are right: Be prepared. Preparation creates calm and secur-
ity. There’s nothing like knowing you have it all under control and the bases
are covered. Conversely, what’s more anxiety producing than being caught
short? Besides, preparation is the realm of grown-ups. Only little kiddies fran-
tically dash around at the last minute trying to tie up loose ends. To not only
appear grown-up but to be way cool:
 Know where you’re going.
 Know how to get there.
 Make sure you have enough gas.
 Know how much (more or less) thing are going to cost.
 Make sure you have enough money.
 Make sure you have $20 tucked somewhere for emergencies.
 Make sure your watch is working.
 Check the following:
• Breath
• Teeth
• Wallet
• Condom (always be prepared!)
• Pits
• Wardrobe

• Curfew (when appropriate)
• Calendar (make sure you’ve got the right day, date, and time)
• Date’s phone number (for emergency traffic snarls, lost directions,
and so on)
• Date’s address
• Tickets (for time and date)

Chapter 11: Getting Your Outside Ready

Fellas, if you want to win a huge number of points, make sure you always have
two clean, ironed handkerchiefs on hand. You can buy them very cheaply at
street fairs or discount stores. Keep a bunch around because nothing will stun
a woman more than offering her a clean, white, pressed, unscented handker-
chief when she gets something in her eye or when she’s crying at a movie. You
instantly become the man. Tissues will not work.
Ten Minutes to Lift-Off
The final ten minutes while you wait for your date can either resemble a tor-
nado or the calm eye of a hurricane. It’s up to you. Again, advance planning is
the significant factor. Table 11-2 shows you how to gracefully straddle the fine
line between getting ready and being ready in ten minutes flat.
Table 11-2
Countdown to Date Time
Time Remaining
What to Do
10 minutes
Scan your reflection in a full-length mirror. Check
for hanging threads, lint, and cat hair. Note: If you
see a thread dangling from a button, don’t pull the
thread. It’ll fall off as sure as leaves vacate trees in
autumn. Instead, wrap the thread around the
button and make a mental note to sew it on before
date two.
Important: Don’t panic if a button, hem, seam, or
anything else lets loose. See the section “Putting
together an emergency repair kit,” earlier in this
chapter.
9 minutes
Use the restroom. If you don’t have to go now, you
probably will in ten minutes, so give it a shot.
8 minutes
Double-check your purse or wallet. Make sure you
have your driver’s license, cash, credit cards, lip-
stick, tissues, keys, and breath mints. Stash your
purse near the door and your wallet near your
heart.
7 minutes
Give your shoes a quick buff with a shoe shine
brush or soft cloth (not the back of your pants —
that’s for emergencies only).

Time Remaining
What to Do
6 minutes
If you’re going to wear an overcoat or jacket, take
it out of the closet and drape it over a chair near
the door. It’s rarely wise to let a date see behind
any closed doors until you at least know the
person’s middle name.
5 minutes
Grab a hand mirror and check out the back of your
head. Make sure your hair looks as good going as
coming.
4 minutes
Quick tooth check. Lipstick? Dried spittle in the
corners of your mouth? Parsley? Chocolate? Take
care of it immediately.
3 minutes
Quick breath check. Because no one can smell his
or her own bad breath, play it safe and pop one of
those breath mints you’ve stashed in your purse or
pocket.
2 minutes
Deep breathing. Shut your eyes, inhale, hold, blow
it out through your minty-fresh mouth. Repeat for
the full minute.
1 minute
Guided imagery. Close your eyes again and picture
a calm person answering the door with an easy,
inviting smile. (You can find more details about
controlling your stress in Chapter 12.)
Now, the only thing left between you and your successful date is the door.
But before the door opens, take a few moments to open an interior door to
yourself, explained in Chapter 12.

 Deconstructing stress
 Calming your mind
 Relaxing your bod
 Affirming calm
You know that delicious feeling when you’re with someone who knows
you, has seen all those ugly warts, and loves you, not in spite of but
because of the real you? Like your Mom or your best bud or your Great Uncle
Louie who swallows you in a giant bear hug and makes you feel special. When
you’re with them, the real you shines so brilliantly, it’s blinding. You’re insight-
ful and charming and intuitive and unbelievably profound. Completely at ease.
That’s how I want you to feel on a first date.
Yeah, right. And I might as well ask you to memorize War and Peace so that
you have something literary to talk about! I know it sounds like a trip to fanta-
syland to imagine you could actually be so cool, calm, and collected that
your date would see the real you from the first hello, but that’s exactly what
I’m going to explain how to do. Relax, it’s simple — not easy, but simple.
Realistically, it’s unlikely that anybody would ever feel that secure, but what
to be sure not to do is to offer a brittle, unrealistic, misleading picture of who
you are and that’s what panic is likely to do for you.
Understanding the Psychology of Stress
In previous chapters, I discuss the physiology of stress: how your body shifts
into the fight-or-flight mode and pumps you up with adrenaline when you
face a tense situation. Later in this chapter, I give you step-by-step instruc-
tions on how to calm those heart-racing, stomach-churning, mouth-drying,
palm-sweating symptoms. Now, though, I want you to explore the other side —
the psychology of stress.

Stress is your system’s response to being overtaxed by anxiety due to excess
drink, sun, food, work, or even fun — too much of anything, even good stuff,
stretches the boundaries. Stress is a spring that’s wound too tightly. It’s your
body’s equivalent of a flashing yellow light, a Caution sign, or a Slippery when
Wet warning.
When you’re just getting to know someone, your senses rally all their resources
to help you evaluate whether this human being is a friend or foe. Intuition, past
experiences, present observations, your ability to trust — they all come into
play and keep cooking as new “cues” come your way. Until you’ve had enough
positive cues to convince you that — whew! — this person is okay (he or she
isn’t going to hurt me, humiliate me, or leave me holding the check), you’re
going to feel a tad stressed, and the yellow light continues to flash, meaning
you’re not ready to let your guard down just yet.
You can reduce your anxiety by understanding that stress is a natural and
useful response to an unknown and potentially scary situation. Instead of dis-
missing your stress, you can leave yourself on guard and then, as you feel
more confident, allow less and less of a barrier between the two of you,
which is the whole point of dating. It’s okay to leave this wall of protection in
place for a while, while you peek around to see what’s on the other side.
The stress wall
A stress wall is a barrier most people build to keep strangers from getting too
close too soon. It keeps others at arm’s length. Like small talk, the walls we
construct to protect ourselves have gotten a bum rap. When built properly
(out of movable and removable building blocks rather than cement), emo-
tional walls serve a very handy purpose. They keep dashing, yet deadly,
Attila the Huns from jabbing a spear into the center of your heart, or nine-
headed Hydras from swimming across your emotional moat and slithering
into your life. The notion that instant vulnerability is a desirable trait is dan-
gerous, indeed. After all, we’re not in Eden anymore.
What I’m trying to get at is the sense that some feelings of stress are a normal
and essential part of being alive, and — dare I say it? — of staying alive. Dating,
by its very nature, is one big, fat unknown. It’s okay to feel a bit of trepidation.
It’s good to drive cautiously with your eyes on the road and your hands at “ten
and two” on the steering wheel. What’s not productive, however, is to work
yourself into a tizzy because you’re suddenly convinced a serial killer must lurk
in the soul of anyone who would date you or that a vengeful ex in an eighteen
wheeler is about to cross the median and obliterate you.

Chapter 12: Getting Your Inside Ready
Stress history
I’ll tell you one of my secrets as a psychologist:
I’m trained to evaluate patterns of behavior
more than single incidents. You can always tell
more about a person by examining what they do
repeatedly than by holding a magnifying glass
up to one mistake or one incredibly romantic
moment. Unless this is your first ever date (in
which case, you can look at your behavior in
other stressful situations like final exams, sports
try-outs, school play auditions, and so on), think
back to other first dates you’ve known. Did you
feel the same way? Act in a similar manner? Call
everyone in your address book and obsess for
days? My guess is the answer is yes. And
there’s a very simple explanation why.
When stressed, we regress, which means that
we revert to an earlier form of behavior that’s
familiar and comfy. It’s why kids become unpotty-
trained when they get a new sib, or why most of
us become childlike when we get sick. Often, you
return to the way you behaved with your family
when you were growing up. This doesn’t mean
the circumstances were always good, just famil-
iar. Remember that old joke about the man who
wouldn’t stop banging his head against the wall?
When asked why, he responded, “It’s the only
thing I know how to do really well, and it feels
really good when I stop.”
We all learned really well how to respond to
stress. This does not mean we all respond really
well.
Think back to the morning of one of your childhood
family vacations. Or just before Thanksgiving
dinner at your house. Or watching your parents
get ready to go out. Pick the scenario that best
describes the scene:
 Serenity reigns. The bags were packed the
day before and are lined up at the front door.
The kids are lined up, too, ready to march
single-file into the station wagon. Or, the table
was set the night before. Roasted turkey
smells fill the calm air. Your mom relaxes on
the couch watching her kids play tiddlywinks.
Or, the baby-sitter is early, Mom is dressed
and waiting, Dad has the directions in hand
and made the reservation weeks ago and is
always so efficient Mom never once has to
ask him, “Did ya remember to . . . ?”
 Chaos reigns. You’re riffling through the pile
of dirty laundry in the corner of your bed-
room searching for your favorite T-shirt to
stuff into your suitcase. Dad keeps yelling, “If
you don’t get into the car now, we’re leaving
without you.” Or, you’re polishing silver as
the doorbell rings, the kitchen looks like
Hurricane Andrew blew through, and your
mother vows, “Next year, Thanksgiving is at
Grandma’s!” Or, Dad is yelling at Mom, who’s
been in the bathroom for the past 45 minutes,
“If you don’t get in the car now, I’m leaving
without you!” When Mom is finally ready,
she asks your dad if he has the address
where they’re going, and he says, “I thought
you had it.”
If you picked the second scenario, your family
is like almost everyone’s family. If you picked the
first, your parents were probably hatched from
an alien pod. In most families, chaos is a part of
all big events, at least to some degree. Your
family life was the school in which you learned
how things are “supposed” to be before a big
event in your life right now.

The goal of this section is to show you how to manage your stress and make
it work for you, not wear you out. First, ask yourself the following questions:
 Was I sober and of sound mind when the date was originally arranged?
 Have I spoken to this person since the date was made?
 Is excitement buried beneath my feelings of stress (as opposed to dread)?
 Is this someone I would unhesitatingly introduce to my mother?
If all or most of your answers are “yes,” your stress wall will probably start
lowering a bit as soon as your date laughs at your first joke.
Creating chaos
If your family life was a roller coaster ride (see the sidebar “Stress history”),
you’re probably feeling the same sort of thrill/terror right now as you get
ready for your date to begin. You’re likely running a teeny bit late, you’re not
totally sure what you’re going to wear, and you think you know where you’re
going. What you’re doing, in essence, is re-creating the same chaos you expe-
rienced as a child because that’s familiar. In this time of stress, you’re
regressing to the comfortable days when, even though your family life was
nutty, you knew your way around.
I can hear you now: “Just a minute, Dr. Joy . . . I’m running late because my boss
called me into her office just as I was leaving.” You haven’t settled on an outfit
because you weren’t sure what the weather would be. For heaven’s sake,
you’re a grown-up. You don’t need to pin the directions to your sleeve — you’re
pretty sure you know where you’re going!
All fine and accurate, but irrelevant. They’re cool excuses, but excuses
nonetheless.
You don’t have to do this anymore. You don’t have to replay your old family
scenes in your current life. You can tell your boss you have an appointment,
you can wear a jacket if the weather’s cold, you can drive with confidence
because you know where you’re going. You can feel cool, calm, and collected
before a date. It’s a choice you can make a little more upfront so that you can
sweat a little less later. Your choice: cool short-term or cool long-term (Hint:
always go for the long-term — it lasts longer). If you want to never let ’em see
you sweat, sweat when they’re not around. Nothing comes easily to every-
one. Trust me on this.
Easing Your Mind
Stress is overtaxing the system — in this case, a physical response to an emo-
tional state. One way to minimize the physical symptoms (discomfort, sweaty
144
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

palms, rapid heart beat, anxiety, queasy stomach) is to ease your mind, and
your body will follow suit. Dealing with your emotions, fears, and worries is
probably your best defense against freaking — you know, that state in which
even the smallest inconvenience or most insignificant problem can send you
over the edge.
Mind over what’s-the-matter
Stress can be a snowball. If you’re not careful, it’s easily an avalanche. If one
thing goes wrong when you’ve let yourself become really tense, you’re sud-
denly tossing your hands up in the air and ready to forfeit the whole game.
Don’t go there. Instead, it’s time for a reality check. Ask yourself the following
questions:
 What do I really feel? Have I jammed a couple of unrelated memories
and fears together to make a stress sandwich? Stop and ask yourself
what’s the worst that could possibly happen? Believe it or not, allowing
your fear to be specific rather than abstract, putting a face on your fear
as it were, can really help because doing so defines, and then lessens,
the fear. The bogeyman thrives in the dark.
 Are my nerves talking, or am I? How many times have you tripped over
your tongue or your good manners and said to yourself, “I can’t believe I
just said that!” If it should happen to you on your date (and it happens
to everyone), ’fess up right away. Apologize. Tell your date you were
momentarily possessed. Just don’t let one faux pas fester into an ugly,
giant, oozing ball of stress.
145
Chapter 12: Getting Your Inside Ready
Stress busters
Here are some cool gadgets and gizmos on the
market that can help chill you out before a date
or anytime you need to kick back a bit:
 Rain chimes (the sound of falling rain)
 Aromatherapy pendants
 Relaxese Glasses (calming flickering lights)
 Herbal pillows
 Tub Tea (giant herbal tea bags for the bath)
 Meditation tapes
 Electric foot massager
 Flexaball (giant ball on which you roll
around)
 Indoor fountains
 Shower massagers
All this great stuff is widely available in New
Age stores or catalogs such as Stress Less
(800-555-3783 or www.stressless.com).

 Am I trying to make sure my date doesn’t get too close? Intimacy is a
scary thing. If you find yourself running for the dugout before the sev-
enth inning stretch, get back in the game and see how it ends up.
 Is this just old family baggage I’m keeping alive? If you notice that you
seem to be falling back on tired old patterns left over from childhood to
make you feel comfortable, give yourself a good talking to. Take a deep
breath and tell yourself you’re safe. It’s okay to feel a little afraid. Don’t
worry — you’ll hold your hand every step of the way.
Looking at every dater’s fears
Everyone who dates feels anxiety or stress sooner or later (usually sooner).
After all, dating isn’t meant to be boring. In earlier sections, I explain the
source of stress and give you techniques for coping with it. In this section,
I identify the fears experienced by anyone who has dallied in the dating
world so that you’ll know that you’re not the only one beset by insecurities
and worries. Then I give some tips for dealing with these fears.
 I’ll say the wrong thing. If you worry that you’ll say, “I see,” to someone
with really bad vision or, “I’m in a really foul mood,” to someone who
looks like a duck, or make a Freudian slip or burp or blurt out the wrong
name when addressing your date, join the club. It happens all the time.
Just take a deep breath, apologize once, and explain that you’re nervous.
 I’ll do the wrong thing. You set your menu on fire by the votive candle
or swallow down the wrong pipe and spend the next five minutes chok-
ing, gasping, and wiping your eyes; ask an usher for a program only
to discover she’s really another audience member who, for some
reason, thought wearing a black-collared red vest to a play would be
a good idea; or mispronounce the name of something on the menu.
Everybody periodically makes mistakes — and sometimes very silly
ones. So why obsess about it? Relax. You’re human. If your date is cool
about it, it can become part of your lore; if not, aren’t you glad you
found out now?
 Broccoli will get stuck in my front teeth. You could avoid smiling all
evening just in case, but what’s the fun in that? Run your tongue over
your teeth occasionally, check the mirror in the restroom, or don’t
order anything green. And relax. Better to take your chances with stuck
broccoli rather than fidget all evening, unless you’re dating a broccoli
bigot.
 I’ll get an erection. Most women won’t notice, and if your date does,
she’ll likely be flattered. Don’t try spilling a glass of water on yourself
as a distraction.
146
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

 I’ll get my period. Only if you wear white — just kidding. The point
is, nerves rev the system. It’s natural and normal. Carry change or 
protection and don’t sweat it. If you’re worried, wear a panty liner
just in case.
 I hate my date. You’re going out because you hope to have a nice time
and good company. But what happens if your date turns out to be a huge
boor, intolerably arrogant, or — eek! — the spawn of Satan. You remem-
ber that it’s only one night and see Chapter 16 to find out how to handle
this situation.
 My date hates me. As charming and warm and funny and wonderful as
you are, you’re occasionally going to stumble across a few people who
just don’t like you. As hard as it may be to imagine, that’s life. If you
want tips on extricating yourself from this situation with the minimum
of pain, skip to Chapter 15.
Regardless of what your fear is, try to put it in perspective and then put it
behind you. Even the most embarrassing blunders are seldom fatal. Plus they
make great stories later.
Relaxing body and soul
Just before your date begins, I want you to try the following relaxation tech-
nique to make sure your body and mind are in a relaxed state. Later, as a sort
of “booster shot” during your date, I want you to periodically do a relaxation
“spot check.” (It’s okay to go to the restroom to relax.) You may want to
scribble a few of these steps on a piece of paper to tuck into your pocket
or purse.
147
Chapter 12: Getting Your Inside Ready
If the right outfit makes you look like a million bucks,
what does the wrong outfit make you look like?
I have a friend who went to a seafood restau-
rant wearing an outfit that, unfortunately, was
nearly indistinguishable from the uniforms that
the waitresses were wearing. On her way back
from the restroom, she was stopped by an
elderly couple who wanted more tartar sauce,
another guy who wanted lemon for his tea, and
so on. By the time she made it back to her table,
she had handed out condiments to nearly half
the people in the restaurant. Her date thought
she’d taken a powder and couldn’t understand
why everyone tried to tip her as they left the
restaurant.

1. Check your breathing.
Look down. Is your stomach expanding with every breath? If not, stop
worrying about your waistline and breathe deeply.
2. Relax your shoulders.
Do they look more like earrings than shoulders? Lower those babies!
While you’re at it, gently swivel your neck in a figure eight.
3. Look at your hands.
If you have fingernail marks in the palms of your hands, you’re a little too
tense. Lay your hands flat on your knees (you can do this under the table,
and no one will be the wiser) and stretch your fingers and your palms.
4. Check your face.
Particularly if you’ve been smiling non-stop, your face can freeze into an
uptight mask. Open your eyes and mouth as wide as you can. Hold.
Release. Note: Don’t try this at the table in the restaurant or in the front
row of the play. After your date is underway, excuse yourself to the pri-
vacy of the restroom stall.
5. Check your mind.
After your date is in full swing, ask yourself whether you are “scoring”
the evening. You know, one point for you when your date laughs at a
joke, one point for your date each time his or her fingertips brush your
arm. If so, cut it out! Bring your mind back to the present moment, stop
overseeing the project, and, hey, enjoy yourself!
Relaxing Your Body
The great thing about emotional stress is this: Because your self is uncon-
sciously telling your body how to respond, it can consciously tell your body
to cut it out. After you decide you want to connect to a quieter, calmer, more
centered part of yourself, peace of mind is only a few minutes away.
Step 1: Heavy breathing
Breath is, quite literally, the essence of life. Deep breathing is the essence of
relaxation. Breathing is the cornerstone of almost all meditation. It’s chi in
Eastern philosophy. Energy. Life force. If you watch a pitcher on the mound, a
gymnast before she leaps onto the balance beam, or a professional bowler as
he stands, ball in both hands, staring down the pins, they all do the same thing:
take a deep breath and blow it out. Which is what I want you to do right now.
148
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

On the day of your date, before you get dressed, block out ten minutes for
your peace of mind. Turn the answering machine on and the volume down.
There’s nothing that can’t wait ten minutes — even if it turns out your date
was lost and calling from a gas station — especially if it’s your mom calling to
tell you she wants (or doesn’t want) grandchildren. They can call you back.
For now, here’s what to do:
1. Pick a quiet room that isn’t too dark, too light, too hot, or too cold.
2. Select a comfortable chair, one that supports your back, arms, and legs.
3. Make sure your clothes are comfortable.
Take off your shoes. Wiggle your toes. Remove your belt. Loosen your
collar.
4. Sit down and let your eyes fall closed.
5. If random thoughts enter your consciousness, allow them to gently
float away like a fluffy cloud.
6. Tune in to your body.
Listen to your heart pumping, your breath inflating and deflating your
lungs, and the blood pulsing in your ears.
7. Feel very heavy in the chair.
8. Breathe deeply in through your nose for a count of four, hold for a
count of four, and exhale for a count of four out through your mouth.
Then hold for two counts of four.
9. Begin again. Repeat four times.
Now, you’re ready to move on to a deeper phase of relaxation.
Step 2: Progressive relaxation
You can banish stress from your system in several ways, including exercise,
meditation, Tai Chi, Pilates, and Yoga. But one of the quickest and most effec-
tive ways is a technique called progressive relaxation. It focuses on each muscle
group, from your toes to your head, and releases tension. I walk you through
the process, step by step. Still seated in your comfortable chair, with your eyes
gently closed, start with the tips of your toes. Repeat each muscle group
sequence twice.
1. Make a fist of your toes. Squeeze. Hold. Release slowly. Repeat.
2. Roll each foot slowly, all the way around from the ankle, clockwise.
Then roll each foot slowly counterclockwise. Point your toes, then
flex them. Repeat.
149
Chapter 12: Getting Your Inside Ready

3. Tense and relax your thighs. Repeat.
4. Make a fist of your buns. Hold tight. Relax. Don’t forget to inhale
deeply through your nose, exhale through your mouth. Repeat.
5. Tighten your stomach muscles. Relax. Repeat.
6. Lift your shoulders up to your ears as high as you can. Now, a bit
higher. Slowly lower both shoulders as far as you can, pushing them
down gently, using only your shoulder muscles. Repeat.
7. Make a fist with your hands. Clench your biceps. Slowly extend your
arms out. Relax. Repeat.
8. With arms extended at shoulder length, flex your hands, palms facing
the far wall, fingers reaching straight up to the ceiling. Press out.
Relax. Repeat.
9. Turn your head all the way to the left and then all the way to the
right. Be sure to keep your shoulders pressed down. Repeat.
10. Scrunch your face up into a ball. Slowly relax it. Repeat.
11. With your eyes still closed, slowly rotate your eyeballs clockwise.
Then counterclockwise. Repeat.
Your whole body should feel very heavy. That’s good. Now, before you
open your eyes, you need to do one final thing: Visualize.

Part IV: Date Day Preparations 
The sounds of the universe
Since I originally wrote this book, both Yoga and
Pilates have become even more popular. I prac-
ticed Yoga years ago and then switched to
Pilates, which is really good for strengthening
your core and square breathing. I now combine
the two and freely integrate the mind-body con-
nection not only in my personal life but on the
air as well. I have been describing square
breathing as a relaxation tool for years as well
as dabbling with Yoga at various times in my life.
My switch to Pilates was partially because,
while I’m not particularly flexible, I’m strong and
have a lot of endurance, so Yoga is hard, and
Pilates is easier for my body type. After
September 11, 2001, when I was at the World
Trade Center for five and a half weeks helping
people out, I really needed a place to go to
regain my equilibrium. I found a nearby Yoga
retreat and spent a week doing yoga for eight
hours a day. The Yoga not only grounded me
and made me able to take a deep cleansing
breath and deal with the Universe in a much
calmer way but also really re-affirmed my com-
mitment to the mind-body continuum.
Deciding to try either Yoga or Pilates right
before a date for the first time is unlikely to have
much of a calming effect. But if you decide to
incorporate either technique in your life on a
long-term, regular basis, you may find that
you’re better able to center your self before any
stressful event. You’ll discover breathing tech-
niques and ways to focus, which are helpful
when you’re dating, asking your boss for a raise,
or trying to sleep at night. Several studies have
found that women who practice Yoga are more

Step 3: Visualization
The mind is an incredibly powerful tool for turning stress on and off. To turn
stress off, you want to create a safe place in your head where you can always
retreat when the going gets tough. The best way to do that is through visual-
ization. With your eyes still comfortably closed, take another deep breath in
through your nose, out through your mouth, and then do the following:
151

content with their bodies regardless of their
weight, so women, maybe this is one of those
things to get your inside matching your outside.
You can find many varieties of Yoga, an ancient
discipline that was practiced in both India and
China. Its migration to the New World, specifically
the United States, has resulted into a transmogri-
fication of a regular buffet of possibilities.
Depending on your personality, strength, body
type, and commitment there are a myriad possi-
bilities. Make sure that you opt for one that will
reduce not increase your stress level by making
you competitive or nervous. The term ‘Yoga’ can
include tapes, studios, practices, gear, mats,
wardrobe, props, and Christy Turlington. In alpha-
betical order, here’s a list of options:
 Anusara Yoga: An aerobic Yoga that
stresses alignment while increasing the
heart rate. It’s a lot faster paced than tradi-
tional Yoga, but less of a cardiovascular
workout than a step or high-impact class.
Purists hate it, but if you’re looking to work
up a bit more of a sweat, give Anusara a try.
 Ashtanga Yoga: A more fundamental Yoga
that utilizes a sequence of postures involv-
ing synchronized breathing, so you basi-
cally have one breath to do any particular
movement. If you’ve done Yoga before and
you’re looking for a challenge, this may be
your particular cup of tea.
 Bikrum Yoga: Done in a very hot room; pop-
ular because you can lose a lot of weight
due to excessive sweating and become
light headed due to dehydration, which can
be mistaken as altered consciousness.
Many folks swear by it, but it seems to me
overly taxing, and weight loss due to sweat
is offset at the drinking fountain.
 Hatha Yoga: Considered classic or basic
Yoga, this is for those who are looking for
inner peace rather than panting, sweating,
and weight loss. You hold postures for a long
time, and the emphasis is on deep breathing.
Beginners get a taste of basics here.
 Iyengar Yoga: Emphasizes procession and
purity of form. (To be quite honest, this is my
favorite because it really does focus on
holding a posture for a long period of time
and doing it absolutely correctly.)
 Jibamukti Yoga: Combines physical practice
with foundations in spiritual teaching.
Jibamukti means “liberation from limitation.”
 Kundalini Yoga: A style of yoga that specif-
ically focuses on energy flow and is recom-

1. Think of a place you’ve been that makes you feel happy and 
comfortable.
You may think of the seashore, a forest, or your childhood bedroom —
wherever you remember feeling totally content. “See” that place in your
mind’s eye. Smell the smells. See the colors. Hear the sounds. Be there.
See yourself in that blissful environment.
2. Think about a special person in your life: someone you love uncondi-
tionally, someone who cherishes you.
See the person slowly walk toward you as you stand in your joyous
place. Feel suffused with comfort and well-being and happiness. Feel
delighted to see this person and feel how delighted the person is to see
you. Let the person’s love wash over you as he gets closer and closer.
Finally, when the person is right next to you, look in the person’s eyes.
Don’t say anything, just look in their eyes. Everything you need to know
and say to one another is said in your eyes.
3. See a pinpoint of pure, bright, warm light.
Watch it expand until it fills the entire space. Feel its warmth. You and
your special person are bathed in the glow of that special light. You have
no cares, no worries. You feel comfortable and warm and loved and
accepted. Experience what it feels like to be surrounded by that light.
4. It’s time for your special person to go, but you don’t feel any sadness.
Feel the love remain as the person leaves.
5. It’s time for the light to recede, but you feel no loss or sadness.
Instead, you still feel the warmth and well-being the light gave you.
6. It’s time to leave your wonderful place. But you’re really not leaving
for good; you’re taking it with you.
Now and forever, this spot, this feeling, will be available to you whenever
you want to go there. It’s you. In you. Always.
7. With your eyes still closed, slowly become aware of your surroundings.
Feel the chair, hear your heart beating. Feel happy, warm, accepted, 
content.
8. Slowly open your eyes. Sit for a moment.
Know that the calm you feel now can be the calm you feel throughout your
entire date . . . if you let it happen.

Pre-Date Affirmations:
Sweet Talking to Self
An affirmation is a positive statement about yourself made in the present
tense. A few kind words to yourself can calm you instantly, as well as quell
any surges of anxiety you may feel as lift-off draws near. Repeat after me:
 “I’m a fun, interesting, worthy person.”
 “I deserve success and happiness.”
 “A date is only a date — it’s not do-or-die time.”
 “I’m calm and fearless.”
 “I will enjoy myself tonight, and my date will, too.”
You’re now internally and (if you’ve read Chapter 11) externally ready to have
a wonderful time.

T
a-da! You’re there. On the street where your date lives. Or you’re tucked
into the back booth of the restaurant where you agreed to meet. It’s full
steam ahead. In a few minutes, your date officially begins. So, too, begins the
task of letting someone in, of being yourself, of allowing someone you don’t
know very well to get to know the real you. It’s okay to be a little nervous.
Most everyone is under the circumstances.
So what do you say when you want to make a smashing first impression, how
do you look, what do you talk about, and how do you act? That’s what this
chapter tells you. You’ll also find a list of topics you should avoid and a help-
ful primer on body language.
Before You Begin
First, try to relax. I know, name a quarterback who’s relaxed on game day. But
truly, the key to letting others in on who you really are is lowering the barri-
ers you construct to keep from getting hurt. Vulnerability is irresistible. You
don’t want to be a puppy’s belly, but the last thing you want to resemble is
Fort Knox.
Second, get three questions ready — three things you want to know. Only
three. You’re not auditioning for Barbara Walter’s job. You’re breaking the ice.
You’re launching communication, not preparing for Interrogation 101.
Third, prepare three things about yourself you want to share. Be ready to talk
about the work you do, movies you’ve seen and liked (and why), and a current

event or two. Again, this isn’t the time for in-depth analysis; you’re not defend-
ing your life’s work here. Still, you want to stimulate a dialogue instead of
listen to a monologue (or dead silence!), and that takes two.
Finally, take a couple of deep breaths and tell yourself you’re safe and deserv-
ing of love and that no matter what happens, Mom will always be there with a
plate of brownies and a hug. Hey, life is good!
Say What? Knowing What to Say
Opening lines, small talk, topics of conversation. Unless you have a real gift of
gab, it’s not a bad idea to have an informal list of things to talk about.
Opening gambits
Because everybody’s most nervous at the beginning — once you get past 
“hi” — an opening line can give you some confidence. There is a universal
opening line that’s guaranteed not to fail: Tell your date she or he looks fabu-
lous (beautiful, handsome, delicious, ravishing, divine . . . you choose the
adjective). The more specific, the better — but stay away from body parts
between the neck and the ankles. Such a compliment as an opening line
immediately puts both of you at ease: Your date knows the preparation
wasn’t in vain, and you fly past the first hurdle with several inches to spare.
Plus, there’s a bonus: Your date will probably return the compliment, and
you’ll both feel your confidence surge.
Of course, a great opening line is only the beginning of an entire date full of
conversation. After all, you can’t keep telling your date that he or she looks
fabulous (stop after 20 or 30 reps). Eventually, you’ll have to actually talk to
one another. That doesn’t mean you have to initiate a discussion of nuclear
physics or the meaning of life as we know it. Start small with small talk, dis-
cussed in the cleverly named “Small talk” section later in this chapter.
The last thing you want to do in the first five minutes is let your date see you
cower. Gobs of nerves are contagious, and so is serenity. This isn’t the final
round of the National Cool Talk Competition. Relax. Take deep breaths and
say what’s on your mind, unless it’s one of the following:
 How are you? The question is trite (“Fine, thank you. How are you?”) or
too personal, depending on the response, especially on a date when a
truthful response probably sounds like, “I’m feeling a bit nervous,
slightly sweaty, a tiny bit nauseous, excited, filled with anticipation, and
hoping we end up really liking one another.”
Yikes!
156
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

Even a clever response (like “I’ve never been better” or “I worked out
today, and I’m on an endorphin high” or “I’m looking forward to our won-
derful evening tonight” or “I’m starved and raring to go”) is kinda cute
but a waste of time.
 Why are you late? If there was a ten-car pileup, it will be the first thing
mentioned. If your date overslept, he or she may or may not tell you. I
know you were kept waiting, worrying, and wondering if you’d written
down the wrong date, and I know that’s not okay, but the first five min-
utes of a date is a tough time to begin sounding like an angry parent.
Make a decision. If your date’s too late for you to forgive and forget,
cancel the date and explain why. If the tardiness is slightly irksome but
you’re willing to overlook it, let it go. I mean really let it go. Don’t bring it
up. Not now, anyway. (When you make the next date, explain that you’re
a bit compulsive about being on time.)
 How do I look? When you’re nervous, it’s easy to fall into the trap of
focusing on yourself and your insecurities. Don’t go there. The quickest
way to ease date-stress is to get out of your head and into the moment.
Assume you look fab and try to relax yourself and your date. No fishing
for compliments.
 Mind if I smoke? Believe it — most people do mind. Unless you met in a
cigar bar, this question is far too risky to even attempt. I know, you
smokers out there are thinking that one puny puff would sure take the
edge off the first moments of a date. You may want to light up so much
your fingers are twitching. But there are two reasons to give your addic-
tion a rest right now: First, smoking is like taking out a billboard ad
announcing you’re nervous. Guys on their way to the guillotine were
offered a final cigarette! Do you want your date to feel as though you’ve
been sentenced to death? Second, cigarette smoking inspires passionate
feelings on both sides of the issue (I know lots of folks who wouldn’t go
out even once with a smoker). The first five minutes of a date are time
for vanilla ice cream, Wonder Bread, and sensible shoes. In short, don’t
even go close to controversy.
No matter what your question is, make sure you don’t make the same mistake
one famous interviewer often makes: You get so involved in the elaborate
question that you pay no attention to the answer. Also, make sure your date
can’t answer your questions by a simple yes or no; otherwise, you’ll feel like
you’re in a batting cage with an automatic pitching machine.
In times of stress, we tend to regress to childhood behaviors that might have
calmed us or felt safe. Many women slip and fall into a sort of “mothering
mode” when they feel anxiety tighten their chests. Questions like “Do you
need a sweater?” “Do you have the directions?” and “Are you sure we have
enough time to make it?” just make your date feel like an inadequate little
boy. Even if he freezes his buns off or doesn’t have the directions or botches
the reservation, keep quiet and let him work his way out of the mess he
made. Remember: You’re not his mom; you’re his date.
157
Chapter 13: Polishing the Act

Okay, so you know what not to ask. But what are some good opening gam-
bits? These are:
 What did you do today? (The focus on the other person shows interest,
and presumably everyone did something.)
 What book (movie, TV show, and so on) is your favorite?
 Are you a cat person or a dog person?
The point here is that you’re gathering the building blocks of a conversa-
tional bridge, a way of getting from no knowledge to important stuff. You
can’t go from “Hi, my name is Fred” to “What do you want in life?” Talking
about weather, books, friends you have in common, and so on is a way to lay
the foundation across the chasm that separates strangers so that they can
meet in the middle or comfortably go back and forth.
Small talk
Small talk has gotten a bum rap (excuse the pun). Mistakenly linked with air-
headedness, the assumption is that those who engage in small talk only
chitchat about life’s piddling moments without a concern for the deeper,
burning issues underneath. Poppycock.
Small talk is a necessary and important part of our social fabric. It’s a way to
adjust to one another, get comfortable, and find your conversational seat.
Without small talk, we’d all be walking up to acquaintances and saying, “Hi.
How would you create peace in the Middle East?” or “Nice to see you. My
father is an alcoholic.”
Getting good at small talk, or at least comfortable with it in small doses, will
hold you in good stead not only on a date, but in life as well. Small talk is just
a means of chatting easily and comfortably about day-to-day issues without
rancor or intensity. Big talk is about politics, religion, family, gun control,
abortion, and whether chocolate should be a controlled substance.

Social Skills 101
It’s not that some people are born charming and
the rest of us are losers. Social skills are
learned, and you can learn the basics by watch-
ing others. It’s okay to pick someone to mimic to
begin with — just like a child copies a parent.
After you learn the basics, you can begin to add
personal variations and style — a sense of
humor, characteristic ways of speaking. Each
social situation is a new opportunity to practice
being you, a social creature. Don’t be a hermit.
You won’t learn anything except how to be
alone.

Safe subjects
Words can knit a warm blanket or cause an explosion. Your directive here is
to create a conversational comfort zone by having a group of icebreakers
ready. These tidbits are designed to put both you and your date at ease:
 Weather: I know, this is so trite it’s almost a national joke. However,
comments about the weather have more to do with presentation than
subject matter. The old chestnut, “Nice weather we’re having,” is a
waste. But confiding that the sky was so clear and beautiful you spent
your lunch hour barefoot in the park is another story entirely. (Besides,
that data gives you a great chance to talk about a great old Neil Simon
movie, Barefoot in the Park, starring Jane Fonda and Robert Redford —
and right there you’ve taken your budding relationship to another level.)
 Location: Where you are right now is a great subject for conversation.
Commenting on the colors, smells, sounds, and tastes in a positive way
(no griping allowed) allows you to share the experience.
 Friends in common: Beware of gossip, but establishing links is a very
good idea.
 News events: Be up-to-date; read the paper, a news magazine, People,
whatever.
 Popular culture: Talk about plays, movies, concerts, rock stars, and so on.
Avoiding Taboo Topics
You want to get (and keep) the conversational ball rolling without a flurry of
true confessions or 20 questions. Taking a sudden vow of silence is a major
faux pas. You want to be open, not transparent. Friendly, not needy. Witty, not
desperate for a laugh. To ease you over dating’s conversational speed bumps,
here’s a primer on the four deadly taboo topics to avoid like the plague.
159
Chapter 13: Polishing the Act
Are we speaking the same language?
Men and women communicate differently:
Women are taught to create intimacy through
talking; men view conversations as negotiations,
a way to jockey for position. Neither style of com-
municating is better; they’re just different.
If your conversation with your date begins to
resemble a sparring match, take a breather and
try to figure out what’s really going on. Your prob-
lem may be different styles of communicating.

Sex
Even if sex is the first thing on your mind, let it be the last thing on your lips.
This covers past, present, and future sexual encounters (both real and vir-
tual). Ditto your sex drive, appetite, and online liaisons.
Talking about sex before you know someone fairly well is not only threaten-
ing, but it’s also confusing. “What did he mean by that?” “Is she coming on to
me?” The last thing you want on a first date is ambiguity. You’re trying to
build trust here, not test it. Even animals know there’s a ritual involved
before mating. Don’t try to short circuit eons of evolution on a first date.
(Which is not to say that your date has to seem like opening day at Celibates
Anonymous. Flirt. See the section “Flirting Fun” for pointers on flirting.)
Exes
If you’re not over your ex enough to avoid mentioning him or her on a first
date, you’re not ready to date (see Chapter 4). Even if you were married to
Jack or Jackie the Ripper, or dated Jack or Jackie Kennedy, let past relation-
ships come up naturally another time. Talking about a former lover dredges
up a c word even more feared than commitment: comparison. Who wants to
start off a relationship wondering if you measure up? Or worse, whether
you’ll ever be able to erase the sins of another? Besides, on a first date, three
is always a crowd.
Politics
Current events are good conversational fodder. But your position on the
death penalty? Abortion? Welfare reform? The president? National health
insurance? The Teamsters? Gun control? A bit risky.
The potential payoff isn’t worth the risk. If your date shares your political
views, is he being truthful or just agreeable? Do you really want a full-scale
argument on your first date?
If you show up in a red tie, navy blue blazer, button-down white shirt, khaki
pants, and brown penny loafers (or wearing suspenders, a belt, and a bow
tie), she’s going to assume that you’re a Republican no matter what you say.
Political hot potatoes to avoid at all costs:
160
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

Religion
If the word “Christmas” or “Hanukkah” slips out while you’re relaying a funny
family story, so be it. If the Bible or the Torah or a Jehovah’s Witness
brochure slips out while you reach for your wallet, that’s a bit over-the-top.
Religion and your relationship (or non-relationship) with whomever you may
or may not believe in is your own business — at least for now. You don’t want
to put your date on the spot. If your date puts you on the spot by asking, say,
whether you believe in God, simply change the subject by asking her whether
she believes O. J. was guilty.
Flirting Fun
Remind yourself that you’re here to have fun, and your jaw unclenches, your
shoulders drop down, your eyes sparkle, your breathing slows, and you’re
ready to flirt.
Flirting is a delicious, low-budget, irresistible, safe-sex sort of way to make
you and your date feel tingly all over. The essence of flirting is interest. No
one ever flirts with anyone they don’t want to know a little bit better. That’s
why flirting on a first date can be so alluring. You’re showing your date you
didn’t make a mistake. You’re interested and ready to go. What could be
sexier that that? (Okay, I know, but not yet.)
Here’s a quick list of what to do (and not do) when flirting with your date:
 Use your whole body. Talking the talk without walking the walk is
utterly ineffective. Don’t believe it? Try telling a woman she’s beautiful
or a guy he’s hunky and then shift your eyes away, and see if you’re
believed. Flirty body language begins with the eyes and works its way all
the way down to the tips of your footsies. Lean forward, make eye con-
tact, smile, bend your knees a bit, and untense your hands and arms.
Remember to relax a bit; this should be fun, not like defusing a bomb.
 Make eye contact. Looking someone in the eyes is very compelling. It
makes a person feel like they’ve got your undivided attention, which
they should.
161
Chapter 13: Polishing the Act
 Police brutality
 Immigration
 National health insurance
 Women in the military
 Any current war or conflict
 September 11 (Geographic location
may come into play here.)
 The designated hitter rule
 Spanking
 Body piercing
 And, of course, Elvis

 Smile, don’t smirk. There’s a reason why synonyms for smirk include
sneer, leer, and grimace: Smirking is an unattractive and unpleasant
expression. Avoid it. Smile openly and sincerely — it’s irresistible.
 Pay attention. No looking like you’re trying to remember if you fed the cat.
 Lighten up; don’t bulldoze. Telling your date he or she is incredibly hot
isn’t flirting; it’s steering your dating experience directly into a mountain.
 Focus on your partner, not yourself. Without slipping into a Barbara
Walters–type litany of prefabricated questions — such as “Whom do you
most admire?” or “If you were a farm animal, what kind would you be?” —
make your date feel as though every word is a pearl of wisdom.
 Don’t think you can’t do it. Anyone can flirt . . . even if only a little.
Flirting is a sign of confidence, and even if you’re feeling a teensy bit
shaky, give it a try. Practice makes perfect and flirty. You don’t have to
be smooth — just sincere.
 Enjoy yourself. Fun is the flirter’s playground. Once you’re having fun,
getting others to play is easy.
Interpreting Body Language
Your body speaks louder than words. So does your date’s. How many dates
will tell you flat out that they’re having a rotten time? Few, if any. Yet how
many will catch periodic glimpses of their watch? Hopefully, not many.
162
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 
Flutter those lashes, girl
A German scientist, Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt,
once studied women’s flirting behavior and
found that nearly all women make the same
facial movements when they flirt, in the exact
same order. They
1. Smile.
2. Lift their eyebrows in a fast, jerky motion.
3. Open their eyes wide (a sign of sympathetic
system arousal, which means that the “Hey,
pay attention!” part of our nervous system
has kicked into gear).
4. Lower their eyelids.
5. Tilt their heads down and to the side (a uni-
versal sign of submission in the animal 
kingdom).
6. Look away.
Sound like anyone you know? These flirting ges-
tures are so universal that Eibl-Eibesfeldt
believes they’re innate sexual signals evolved
from the beginning of human history.

In the mating game, women use their heads, and men use their chests.
Literally. Women toss their hair or sweep their heads back as a sign of attrac-
tion; men simply puff out their chests. It’s a throwback to our primitive pasts
when big, burly Cro-Magnon men and savvy Cro-Magnon women were the
kings and queens of the veldt. Now, in our modern jungle, the signs are still
there. You just have to know what to look for.
If you spend all your time looking at nonverbal cues, you’re not going to be
focusing on what your date is saying and you’re not going to be doing your
part about spontaneously responding. So chill out here and don’t spend more
than a millisecond of your precious time together “studying” your date. If you
do, you’ll both be miserable.
Reading body language is far from an exact science. It’s one part observation,
two parts interpretation. People cross their arms when they’re cold as well as
closed off. Look for consistent groups of gestures or a suddenly inconsistent
movement. Look for patterns, but don’t get hung up here. Focus on what you’re
saying verbally to one another and look to nonverbal clues only when in doubt.

Positive signs
If your date is using a lot of the following signals, you can take it as a good
sign that he or she is interested and having a good time. Congratulations!
 Good eye contact: Gazing (not staring) into someone’s eyes is a good sign.
 Leaning forward: Making the space between you two smaller and cozier
signals that interest is on the way up and walls are on the way down.
 Relaxed posture: Sitting or standing comfortably and breathing
smoothly indicates that your date is open and non-defensive.
 Palms up: Open hands indicate a warm and receptive heart.
 Touching: If the touching is warm rather than suggestive, you’re making
contact.
 Nodding: If your date nods periodically as you speak, you’re on the
same wavelength.
 Mirroring: Unconsciously reflecting each other’s behavior — leaning
forward at the same time, breathing in sync, crossing the same leg over
the other at the same time, speaking in the same tone — says that you’re
attuned to one another.
 Synchronization: Simultaneous breathing, blinking, and shifting in your
seat means you’re in sync.
Negative signs
Your date may not be finger-drumming the tabletop, but displaying any of the
following signals can be a warning:
 Frequent nodding: The Yin and Yang of body language, a little nodding is
a good sign; continuous head-bobbing means you’ve lost the connection.
 Open mouth: If your date always seems to be trying to break in, you
may be too long-winded and have lost your partner’s interest.
 Hands on mouth: This is a censoring mechanism, literally stopping the
words as they come out of the mouth — not a good sign.
 Arms crossed: Any type of closed-up body posture indicates a barrier
between the two of you (unless the room is cold — look for goose bumps).
 Arms behind the head: On a first date, this is a classic sign of 
dominance . . . or the attempt to gain it.
 Yawning: You guessed it — bored to tears.
We’ve all been learning to interpret nonverbal cues since the first time our
mothers cradled us; survival depended on spotting Dad’s mood or Grandma’s
pride or our sister’s sulking. Studies have shown that kids who can easily read
164
Part IV: Date Day Preparations 

subtle facial cues survive the perils of grammar school far better than their
more obtuse peers. If you suspect that your date is annoyed or bored or impa-
tient, it’s okay to test the waters. See whether changing the subject works or
even, egad, say, “I seem to have turned you off.” Then ask, “Was it something I
said?” You’ll score points for sensitivity. But ask only once. No nagging!
Okay, now that you know all this stuff, should you become Sherlock Holmes
or just enjoy your date? Elementary, my dear. Relax and enjoy. However, if
you want a way to check out your own unconscious reactions, you don’t need
to study a videotape to see if you’re mirroring.
Mirroring
You know that great feeling when you and another person are totally in sync?
You laugh at the same jokes, love the same food, both thought The English
Patient was way too long? Similarity is the essence of connection, and connec-
tion is the essence of trust, and trust is the foundation for true love.
You’re mirroring each other if you’re
 Duplicating your date’s body language.
Are you both leaning forward at the same time, each sitting with legs
crossed?
 Adopting the same speaking rhythm.
Are you both talking softly, going back and forth conversationally, shar-
ing the same pacing?
 Echoing style or energy level.
Are you both mellow or energized, calm or hyped?
Subtlety is the essence of good mirroring. You don’t want to get caught mim-
icking your date. The trick is to have your date feel connected, not pick up on
a monkey-see, monkey-do act. You’ll naturally either fall into — or out of — a
sort of relationship sync, which you can’t fake for long. Rather than direct
yourself to do it, see whether mirroring just occurs normally.
165
Chapter 13: Polishing the Act
Lying eyes?
Is your date telling the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, or is he or she fibbing? The
nose knows. Called the Pinocchio Syndrome
(really, it is), liars tend to rub their noses when in
the throes of a fib. Under stress, the erectile tis-
sues in the nose become engorged with blood
and sort of tickle.

Listening Attentively and Effectively
Trust me on this — I make my living listening to others — your date will tell
you everything you need to know about him or her in the first 15 minutes.
Not 50. 15. Train yourself really to hear what your date’s saying (and believe
it). Of course, therein lies the rub: While love may be blind, dating is almost
always deaf.
My friend Elaine “bought” a date with a soap star at a charity auction. She
could scarcely afford her winning $250 bid, but she had such a crush on the
guy she was willing to brown bag it for the half year it would take to make up
the deficit. They met at a trendy New York restaurant. He looked incredible.
She was flushed with the thrill of it all. Their first minute of conversation, as
she later relayed it to me, went a little something like this:
HE (laughing): I can’t believe you paid so much for me. I’m not worth it.
SHE (also laughing): It went to a good cause — me.
HE: I’m really not into the dating scene. I barely have time to learn my
lines and go to bed.
SHE: Thank you for squeezing me into your busy schedule.
HE: I barely made it. I’m leaving for L.A. tomorrow.
SHE: Business?
HE: Hopefully. I’m up for a series.
SHE: Good luck. I hope you get it.
Of course, she was lying, and he was telling the honest-to-goodness truth.
Elaine thought their date went smashingly well and was devastated when he
didn’t call her again — which she could have known he wouldn’t do if she’d
listened with open ears instead of a too-wide-open heart. He’d told her flat-
out he wasn’t worth it, didn’t date, and was going to move 3,000 miles away.
And he’d said it all in the first 30 seconds of their evening together.
Learning how to listen is not easy, but it is simple. You have to train yourself to
focus on the present moment only — not on your witty comeback, the follow-
up question, the stupid thing you can’t believe you just said, the parsley you
can feel lodged in between your teeth. You have to be in the now. Period.
If you want to be a good listener, you have to
 Train yourself to stay with the talker, word for word, until he or she is
finished. Simple concept, but really difficult to practice.
 Suspend judgment and open your heart and head, as well as your ears.
Listen to what the person is actually saying — not what you want to
hear; it’s crucial not only to dating but to all human interactions.

The Date

In this part . . .
L
anding the date is only the beginning. Now you’ve got
an afternoon, evening, lunch hour, or coffee break to
fill with witty repartee. You want to have a good time as
much as your date does. Not always a done deal. So to
make good dates even better, so-so dates okay, and awful
dates endurable, this part offers pointers on all kinds of
dates: the good, the bad, and the holy-nelly-was-this-a-giant-
mistake ugly. I’ll help you minimize awkward moments from
the first hello to the last-minute kiss question (lips? cheek?
air?) so that you can maximize your chances of having a
wonderful time that naturally morphs into date number
two and beyond.

P
resumably you’ve planned your date carefully and are fully prepared. (If
not, flip to Chapters 11 through 13 for a refresher course.) At this point,
I’m confident you not only know where you’re going, how to get there, and
about how much it’ll cost, but you’re dressed appropriately, and you’ve fully
factored your date into the equation. You’ve selected a destination you both
will like and haven’t decided that now would be a good time to start smoking,
wearing fur, or pinning a campaign button to your lapel.
Now you’re all set to have a good time. This chapter tells you how to make
the most of your date, how to deal with the unexpected catastrophes that
may creep up, and how to end the evening gracefully.
Not-so-great expectations
There are 365 days a year — at least 52
Saturday nights, at least 52 Friday nights, and an
abundance of after-school afternoons and
after-work evenings. One date that doesn’t send
you soaring is precisely that — one date.
Expecting more is asking for trouble.
Keeping your expectations in check is perhaps
the best way to have a reasonably good time on
almost any date. There’s always something
interesting about anybody. Even if you know
immediately that your date is not “the one,”
what have you got to lose if you relax and enjoy
whatever it is he or she does have to offer? You
never know . . . the person may be the perfect
match for a friend.

Enjoying Yourself
It doesn’t have to be the Fourth of July for you to have a great time on your
first date. The sky doesn’t need to erupt in fireworks for you to consider your
date a winner. What does need to happen is that you create an environment
that allows both you and your date to relax a little, let your hair down, get to
know one another, and have fun. The basics of enjoying yourself are fairly
straightforward:
 Be relaxed.
 Be yourself.
 Be prepared to talk — and listen (see Chapter 20 for conversation 
pointers).
 Be prepared (think Boy Scout — money, time, place, way, and so on —
and see Part I).
 Be okay about silences (if they don’t go on too long).
 Be realistic about expectations.
Don’t sweat it — it’s pretty hard to really screw things up. Besides, it’s only
one date. With a bit of pre-planning on your part — which is, essentially, what
all the earlier chapters have been about — this date can be a really cool one.
Pace yourself. A date has a beginning, a middle, and an end. You’re not on the
clock. Your date doesn’t have to love you in the first five minutes or it’s the
ejector seat. You don’t have to love your date instantly either. Keep remind-
ing yourself what a date is really all about: getting to know one another.
Relax. Enjoy yourself. And take it easy.
Making the Most of the Place You Picked
In Chapter 10, I talk about great places to take a first date. My general feeling
is this: Why add one more worry with an unknown location when you can
boost your confidence by going someplace you already know is terrific? It
just makes good sense.
Restaurants
Food is part of a time-honored traditional date activity, so figuring out how
you can make eating out a delicious experience is time well-spent since eating
“in” is for later on — after you get to know each other.
170
Part V: The Date 

Order food you eat with a fork
Forget about sandwiches (unless that’s all there is — in that case, the fewer
ingredients, the better). Food you lift with your hands can easily fall from your
hands. High-rise sandwiches are notorious for collapsing on the way up to your
mouth. Stringy pizza cheese dangles from your lips like you just swallowed
twine, sushi is rarely served in petite bite-sized portions, and tacos spill.
Don’t drink
I know, I’m going to lose a lot of you here — if you’re nervous you might be
trying to relax yourself. But Miller Time can become mildew time before you
know it. Be very careful about alcohol. If you’ve ever had a problem with
alcohol, fuhgettaboutit — don’t drink. I can already hear you muttering, “Hey,
a drink or two will relax me. I can handle it,” but it’s you that I’m talking to
here. Moderation when you’re nervous is difficult to achieve, so err on the
side of caution here and believe that alcohol on a first date is dangerous for
several reasons:
 Nerves magnify the effects of alcohol. You get drunk faster.
 Alcohol has been proven to dismantle your appetite control. While
one of you is ready for the check, the drinker is ready for a second
round of desserts.
 Too much alcohol creates a sort of “tunnel vision.” You can’t see or fully
comprehend anything that’s not right in front of your face. That’s why it’s
so dangerous to drive, handle heavy wallets, or — heaven forbid — open
up your body and soul.
 The risk of drinking and driving is huge when you’ve been drinking . . .
and nonexistent when you haven’t.
 Alcohol is the solvent of the superego. Suddenly, you’re saying, doing,
and feeling things you’d never say, do, or feel if you were sober.
 All your guards are down when you’re tipsy, including your sexual
judgments. The chances that you’ll say “yes” when you really mean “no”
or hear “yes” when you’re told “no” are much greater.
171
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time
Nine foods to fear on a first date
Stay away from these foods unless you have
breath mints, dental floss, and guts:
 Corn on the cob
 French onion soup
 Fried chicken
 Garlic
 Popcorn
 Poppy seeds
 Ribs
 Watermelon
 Whole lobster

Eat!
Okay — so I’ve put alcohol off-limits, but it’s okay to indulge in dessert calories.
Most men are much more comfortable with women who eat reasonably
rather than the “Oh, I’ll just have a small salad with the dressing on the side”
syndrome. (Surveys show that women put much more pressure on them-
selves to have a “perfect” body than men ever put on them.)
It’s okay to share a dessert. First of all, you’ll find out if he works and plays
well with others. Secondly, it sends a loud and clear message that you’re not
anorexic or obsessed with your weight. Watching your waistline is one thing,
entering a convent is another. Eating is a sensual, pleasurable experience
that’s meant to be savored. I’m not saying you should throw calories to the
wind and use date night as an excuse to imitate Miss Piggy, but enjoying your-
self means letting go enough to enjoy your date, the conversation, the loca-
tion, the colors, the smells, the sights, the sounds, and the meal — the whole
enchilada or creme brulée.
Tip well
I’m talking 20 percent. At least. Generosity is attractive. Trust me, the miser
never gets the girl. He may keep a few extra dollars, but a person who is tight
with money is unlikely to be generous with time or self.
Mind your manners
Good manners count. Make no mistake about it. Nothing is a bigger turn-off
than seeing food churning round and round inside your date’s open mouth.
Ugh. Or being rude to waiters, talking too loudly, picking up peas with a knife
172
Part V: The Date 
Mister Smoothie
I once dated a man who nearly knocked me
over with his James Bond–type style. Smooth
as silk. He took me to a nice restaurant, one that
he’d obviously been to before. After we finished
our cappuccinos and dabbed our lips with our
pink linen napkins, he asked, “Ready to go?”
Noticing the check had neither arrived nor been
paid, I replied, “Shall we make a run for it?” He
laughed and told me it was all taken care of.
Later, I found out that he’d gone to that restau-
rant the day before, given them his credit card
number, and instructed them to add 20 percent
for the tip. A slight nod from the waiter (which I
never saw) let him know the whole money thing
was a done deal.
Is that cool or what? What struck me most was
his effort and advance planning. He confided in
me later that the check arrival and tip calcula-
tion had always felt awkward to him so he
worked out a way around it. Smooth move.
I actually used the same move later on him for
his birthday so there would be no awkwardness
about my treating him.

and sliding them down your throat. Think Jane Austen or Masterpiece Theater
or that guy who pulls up in his Rolls and asks, “I say, have you any Grey
Poupon?” You want to be prim and very proper. At the very least, do these
things:
 Chew with your mouth closed.
 Be polite to the waiters.
 Talk softly.
 Use your napkin.
Movies or plays
This dating venue is a double-edged sword. On one side, you’re creating a
“shared experience.” Good for bonding. One of the stepping stones of inti-
macy. On the other side, most of your date will be spent in the dark staring
not at each other. Not the ideal way to get to know somebody. To make the
most of a movie or play, be open to discussing it afterward. You can talk about
the plot, the casting decisions, the money it cost to make it, other movies
you’ve seen that you like better, childhood memories this movie evokes —
anything. If it was horrible, you can talk — and laugh — about that as well.
I know I already mentioned this in Chapter 10, but it’s worth checking to
make sure that your date approves your choice. Surprises will be more effec-
tive once you are more certain of each other’s tastes!
Concerts
A concert lets you relate to each other while the music plays, or in the midst of
a break. So relate already: Bob back and forth together with the beat, scream in
each other’s ears to be heard over the noise, and, when your ears are ringing
afterward and you can’t hear anything anyway, just smile dopily at one another.
Besides, if you aren’t having a good time, you can leave a concert mid-stream
without wondering all night if you missed the really good part. Simply buy
the CD.
Sporting events
It’s often much more fun attending a live sporting event than watching it on
TV. Even if you’re not into football, you can get into nachos and peanuts. It’s
outdoors (usually) and in daylight, and you can even paint your face the
color of your favorite team.
173
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time

Special events
If you have two tickets to a Beatles reunion tour, you’ve got a great first date
on your hands. Once-in-a-lifetime events are your basic date shoe-in. If Paul
and Ringo do decide to go on tour, I’m available. (I once turned down a cruise
for two on the QE2 because I had Rolling Stones tickets.)
A Word about Silence
Everybody worries about not having anything to say, but if you can remind
yourself that you’re the “you” expert and you’re curious about your date,
then you’ll be able to maintain the conversational flow without panicking
over silences. In general, you want to reveal who you are without confessing
every flaw, being sexy without being sexual, funny and light without being
desperate for a laugh. If you’re not sure what to talk about once you get
there, check out Chapter 12.
174
Part V: The Date 
Lip service
To do it, or not to do it? You know what I’m talking
about — it’s the ghastly decision every woman
must make at the end of a restaurant meal. Does
she reapply her lipstick at the table, excuse her-
self to the ladies room, or just sit there, a lipless
wonder, hoping her date has the class not to
stare at the thin beige lines that were once her
luscious pout? Alas, there is no simple answer.
Etiquette pros cringe at the notion of a woman
pulling out a compact and rolling up a tube of
ruby red and applying it meticulously at the table.
Such things are a private affair, best suited to the
restroom. I have to agree . . . at least to a certain
extent. On a date, three is always a crowd. You
don’t want to end a fabulous meal with him and
you and your reflection. However, a quick swipe
(sans mirror) seems to me to be a perfectly
acceptable compromise. I don’t believe in leav-
ing your date languishing alone at your table,
staring into space, twiddling his thumbs, just so
you can retreat to the restroom to properly apply
lip liner before your lipstick. It’s not nice.
That said, here’s what I do: In an accessible
pocket of my purse, I stash a neutral-tone lip-
stick just for such occasions. In two seconds
flat, I whip it out, swipe it across my lips (hey,
I’ve had these same lips for years — I know
where they are), and return it to my purse,
barely missing a beat. The neutral tone makes
sure I’ll still look okay even if I accidentally
cross over a lip line or two. Use a neutral color;
save the Evita red you wore on the way in, or
you run the risk of looking like Baby Jane (not a
soothing sight after your date just ate).
If I do have to use the facilities, I can do both
simultaneously. But if we’re lingering over decaf,
I’d rather feel happy and with non-chapped,
freshly colored lips than get up and leave.

Fielding the Curve Balls
A curve ball (or two or twenty) is waiting for you on this first date. You can
take that to the Dating Bank. No matter how well you prepare, something may
go amiss — or at least, not according to your Pentagon-perfect plan. It’s
Murphy’s Law of Dating. The trick is to prepare for the worst and then relax
and field whatever may come your way.
Surviving dating’s most
embarrassing moments
One of my best friends remembers her first big high school dance as bitter-
sweet. It was a formal affair (as they were in those days), the guy she’d had a
crush on all year had asked her to go, and her dress was to-die-for. That’s the
sweet part. Her bitter pill was waking up the morning of the dance to find a
giant pimple perched on the tip of her nose like Mount St. Helens. The more
she fussed with it all day, the worse it got. That evening, as the doorbell rang,
my friend was squirreled away in the bathroom frantically powdering the tip
of her nose — which by now rivaled Bozo the Clown’s. A bona fide disaster.
She left for the dance with one white-gloved hand hovering over the front of
her face. Perhaps, she consoled herself, her date wouldn’t notice. He did.
After all, her uncomfortable behavior was as plain as the nose on her face.
175
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time
Big date do’s and don’ts
It’s prom night, your sister’s wedding, your 30th
birthday, New Year’s Eve, a retirement party at
the firm . . . whatever. When it comes to a BIG
date, as in not-just-any-old-Saturday-night date,
these guidelines help you have a great time:
 DO plan ahead. Big dates are almost always
dates you know are coming weeks in
advance. Arrange your date as soon as
possible so he or she can mark a calendar,
rent a tux, buy a great present, etc.
 DON’T make a first date a big date. It’s too
risky and too loaded. See Chapter 10.
 DO ask someone with whom you’re really
comfortable. Big dates tend to be longer
than your average date and often include
family members. The last thing you want is
a high-maintenance date.
 DON’T make your big date such a big deal that
your companion feels like it’s a pre-marital
date, too. It’s okay to go out on a big date with
Mr. or Ms. Kinda Right or Right Now.
 DO substitute a platonic date when a great
date isn’t in the cards. It’s better to have a fun
time with a friend (or alone!) than have a mis-
erable time with a date who doesn’t work out.

“So you’ve got a pimple on the end of your nose!” her date finally exclaimed.
Apparently, he was tired of gazing into a glove. “Is it the end of the world?” Of
course, the answer was “no” (it only felt like it), and the lesson was learned.
From that moment on, she heaved a huge sigh of relief, held her date’s hand,
and had a great time. Which is what you can do, too, as soon as you master
the perfect remedy for the following dating disasters.
The first rule: No matter what the problem, ’fess up immediately. Your date
will sense something is wrong and think the problem’s her or him. And
remember, no matter how bad it gets, really, is it the end of the world?
Table 14-1 offers some ways to deal with potential mishaps.
Table 14-1
Solving Dating Dilemmas
Disaster
Solution
Your pants (skirt, shirt, bra) split.
Tie your jacket or sweater around your
waist; buy or borrow a jacket or sweater to
tie around your waist.
Borrow a safety pin from the waiter.
You forgot your wallet or billfold.
Throw yourself on the mercy of either your
date or the manager (if you’re a regular
there). If your date likes you, at least he or
she will know there will be another date —
one for which you pay in full.
176
Part V: The Date 
Tarzan to the rescue
One of my all-time favorite cool/horrible date sto-
ries was told to me on a dark and stormy night in
Colorado by my Girl Scout advisor when I was
interviewing to be an international spokesperson
(little did they know I’d convinced a couple of Air
Force cadets to chop down a tree in a national
forest for a campfire . . . I digress). She told me a
terrific tale of being asked to her senior prom by
her next-door neighbor because neither had a
date and they’d been friends forever. Her mother
made her a strapless formal dress, and the last
butterfly was alighting on the bodice when he
rang the bell.
As they danced their first dance, he suddenly
pulled her to him and held on for dear life. She
was suitably impressed and figured, hey, me
Jane, you Tarzan — until he hissed, “Waltz
toward the ladies room.” Her dress, it turned
out, had fallen down. In a moment of true
chivalry, he figured it would be less noticeable
if he held her tightly all the way into the ladies
room. What a cool guy. Only 18 years old and
such presence of mind.

Disaster
Solution
You get carded.
Be grateful for it. Sooner or later all of this
will come to an end. But make sure you do
have identification with you. Don’t be trying
to sneak into a movie or order a drink if
you’re too young. I promise you, this problem
will clear itself up in the long run.
You get sick.
Hey, sick happens. Just don’t deny it so long
that you get sick right then and there. Tell
your date you’re not feeling well and need a
few minutes in the restroom. If you really
don’t think you’re going to make it, ask your
date for help. Passing out in a bathroom stall
will only make a bad situation worse. It’s
okay to ask for a rain check — or a barf
check or a nasal drip check.
You pass wind.
Most importantly, avoid breaking out in a 15-
minute nervous laughing jag. Apologize once
and then (if possible) open a window.
You run into an angry ex.
Remind yourself that you are not responsible
for anyone’s behavior but your own. Stay
calm and let your ex be the only person in the
room who makes a fool of himself or herself.
Your car breaks down.
Presumably you belong to an auto club so
you won’t have to flip through the Yellow
Pages looking for a reputable tow. Best thing
to do is make the best of it. Don’t sink into a
quicksand of self-blame. See whether the
tow truck can drop you off at the restaurant
on the way, take a cab home, and deal with
your dead car tomorrow.
Remember: A little reconnaissance means
you won’t run out of gas or get a flat without
a spare.
If you’re old enough to date, you’re old enough to understand menstrual
cycles and periods and accidents. Should your date experience such an
unfortunate mishap, it’s up to you to help diffuse her mortification. Don’t
make light of it (believe me — she won’t think it’s funny), but don’t use this
opportunity to “bond” with her by confessing your horror, either. Try what’s
been known to work well before — tell her you’re sorry it happened, then lov-
ingly add, “Hey, it’s not the end of the world.”
177
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time

Lighten up
No matter what happens, the biggest thing to bear in mind is this: It’s a date —
just a date. Not brain surgery or the cure for cancer or the Bill of Rights or
Macbeth. It’s not serious drama with dire consequences. It’s a date. So while
you’re in the midst of it all, why not lighten up?
The punsters weren’t kidding when they said, “Laughter is the best medi-
cine.” Several studies have found that jovial belly laughs not only improve
circulation and work muscles all over the body, but they relieve stress much
in the same way aerobic exercise does. Even in our darkest moments, laugh-
ter can instantly make things seem, and feel, much better. Though I don’t rec-
ommend tossing one-liners non-stop, looking on the bright side of a dim
moment can mean the difference between a disaster date and one that’s the
beginning of a great relationship.
Picking Up the Check
The moment has arrived. You dab the corners of your mouth with a napkin
as the waiter strategically positions the check halfway between you and your
date. Now what? I provide the answer in Chapter 10, but it’s worth revisiting
here: You asked, you pay.
178
Part V: The Date 
Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen . . .
If we’re talking dating disasters, I may well be
the poster girl. I had a dress that came com-
pletely apart: First the hem fell; then one of the
sleeves dropped off; then the other wouldn’t
budge. The cummerbund came apart, and the
dress weighed more than I did. (Mom thought it
would be cool to make my dress out of drapery
material.) By the time I got home after my date,
I looked like I’d been attacked.
Another time, my date’s car horn got stuck in a
hospital zone, and the car broke down so I
missed curfew. (Of course, this was also my
first date with the guy who became my hus-
band — but not that night.) My elegant white
gloves demonstrated capillary action by draw-
ing coffee up the absorbent, white cotton fin-
gers like a straw when I didn’t have enough
sense to take them off before they got too close
to my coffee cup into which I was pouring an
envelope of sugar. (My first cup of coffee,
formal, white gloves, sigh. . . .) My science
teacher would have been proud; my mother
would have fainted.
I’ve also constructed glass towers that crashed
and caught sugar bowls on fire and lived to
write a book telling other people how to date.
The moral? Never despair.

I know I’m going to catch a little heat, but my rule for the first date, at least, is
the asker (male or female) forks over the dough. After that, you can negotiate
other arrangements. Or you can let the check sit there and stew.
What paying means:
 You’re investing in this relationship . . . no matter how briefly.
 You’re not cheap . . . on any level.
 You’ve got class and style and a little jingle in your pocket. Everyone
loves all three.
What paying doesn’t mean:
 You’ve just bought sex, too.
 You’ve bought yourself another date.
 Your date now owes you.
Ending the Date Gracefully
At first glance, it would seem easy to know when a date is over. The empty
dishes have been cleared off your table, the check is paid, the theater lights
are up, or the sun has risen. There are definitely markers. But a date is an
emotional event. What’s an empty restaurant and five glaring waiters when
this could be true love? Plus, if things are going well, you’re also battling your
biology.
When you’re in the throes of infatuation, a chemical in your brain called
phenylethylamine (PEA) causes those tingly feelings of euphoria. Other neuro-
chemicals, namely norepinephrine and dopamine, may also play a part in
your “lover’s high.” These natural “uppers” are what cause lovers to stay
awake all night gazing into each other’s eyes or talking into the wee hours of
the morning. Sadly, or perhaps thankfully, this chemically induced elation
fades. Your brain can’t stay in a revved-up state forever!
Pacing yourself may seem like a waste of time if you and your date have
clicked from the start. But in the long run, it’s always better to leave them
wanting more than feeling like it was just this side of too much. Assuming
your date has gone well (if it hasn’t, see Chapters 15, 16, or 17), you want the
end of your first date to be the beginning of a beautiful relationship, not the
grand finale of one memorable night.
Lots of details on various dating outcomes are coming up in the next few
chapters. For now, though, here are some general rules on how to end the
date gracefully.
179
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time

Successful date
If your date is going well, mention date number two before date number one
is over. You don’t have to fish out your PDA or whip out a cell phone to check
with your secretary or your mom or your boss, but the subject can be
broached. This is important: Be honest (don’t say you’ll call just to be nice).
When the date ends, do any — or all — of the following:
 Make out: You know, share soulful kisses and tender caresses — but
don’t have sex. (See Chapter 31 for info on the sex question.)
 Follow up: Call, e-mail, fax, beep.
So-so date
Sometimes you’re not sure how you feel until the excitement dies down and
real-life takes over and you regain your perspective. That’s perfectly fine. Just
’fess up. Tell your date you had a good time, your head is spinning, and you
need a little time to sort out your feelings. It may sound a tad insensitive, but
it’s much better than the “Hey, baby, I’ll call you” line if you’re really not sure
you will.
If your date says to you he or she needs a few days to digest it all, smile
sweetly, say “Great” and go home. Not go phone. Simply go home and live
your life. Remember, a watched phone never rings.
So if you’re not sure about the date:
 Wait for follow-up — but live your life: Don’t spend all your time wait-
ing next to the phone.
 Give yourself a week or so to ponder: Upon reflection, the scales usu-
ally tip one way or the other.
 Don’t have sex: If you’re not sure how you feel about the date, you are
definitely not ready to have sex.
Disaster date
If you don’t want to see each other again, don’t say you’ll call. If you’re bored
to tears, don’t say, “Yeah, that would be fun,” when your date suggests a
follow-up day at the beach. It’s icky, it’s awkward, it’s painful, it makes your
forehead sweat, but honesty is ultimately the best way to go.
180
Part V: The Date 

If you have no intention of seeing what’s behind date number two, say it now.
Be polite, be firm, be honest, be brave. Do the right thing. You can say, “I’ll be
busy for the next six months,” “I feel a migraine coming on,” or “I’m taking
final vows on Thursday.” They’ll get the message. Just don’t say, “I’ll call” or
“Maybe we can do this again” if you have no desire to do either.
 Don’t say you’ll call, fax, e-mail, beep. It’s not nice to be dishonest
about what you intend to do.
 Don’t have sex. The reason is pretty obvious, right?
The Kiss Question
Speaking of intimacy . . . the all-important question looming large at the end
of almost every date is as simple and as complicated as two pair of lips.
Should we kiss?
Kissing is an intimate act — at least, intimate kissing is. You’re literally open-
ing up to someone. Your eyes are (usually) closed, and your neck is exposed.
Physically (and primally), it’s a very vulnerable position. Emotionally, it’s
incredibly vulnerable. How many folks have lain awake at night, dreamily
remembering their date’s kiss?
181
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time
Ten signs it’s a disaster date
Your date:
1. Goes to the bathroom and never returns.
2. Stiffs you with the bill after ordering the
most expensive thing on the menu.
3. Sits at another table.
4. Flirts with the waiter or waitress.
5. Says, “I just forgot, my father’s having
surgery,” “I’m having a root canal,” or “I’m
taking final vows,” when you suggest get-
ting together again.
6. Asks to borrow your car keys and doesn’t
return.
7. Asks to practice your signature and then
steals your credit card.
8. Calls a parent to come pick them up without
telling you.
9. Calls the police.
10. Buys an attack dog.

A college friend of mine once confided that if she kissed a man, she’d sleep
with him. I was shocked at such a confession, until she explained it further.
Kissing is such an intimate act, she said, perhaps the most intimate act, that
she’d never kiss someone unless she was ready to go all the way. Others feel
kissing is foreplay, and lots of folks like kissing all by itself.
It’s in his (or her) kiss
According to Boston College professor William Cane, author of The Art of
Kissing, there are 25 different ways to smooch. 25! There’s the eye kiss, the
wet kiss, the butterfly, the friendly, and the ever-popular lip-o-suction. That’s
just naming a few. Unless you plan to end your date with a “see ya” peck on
the cheek, it’s important to know the difference between a quick kiss, a seri-
ous kiss, and seriously making out:
 Handshake: If your date extends his or her hand instead of lips, it means
one of two things: One, he or she is trying to do the right (as in respect-
ful) thing and not move too fast. Two, the moment is awkward, and your
date isn’t sure what to do. A handshake isn’t necessarily a brush-off. A
kiss-off is a brush-off. If you want more, try a gentle, friendly hug and see
what happens.
 Hug: Since your entire body is involved, a hug can be the gateway to
more intimacy. It’s also what Uncle Wally and Aunt Mildred do to you just
before they pinch your cheeks. The duration of the hug determines what

Hug index
A hug is a many splendored thing. It’s intimate, motherly, fatherly, consoling, sexual, and casual. The
manner in which the hugger hugs and the huggee hugs back may communicate a lot about the way
they feel about each other. Take a look.

accompanied by a kiss

happens next. If it’s a quick body-pressing, take it as the equivalent of a
quick kiss (see the next item). If your date holds you close, and you like
it, a simple tilt of the head and, voilá, you’re in perfect kissing position.
 Quick kiss: Quick kisses are everywhere. People who barely know one
another quick kiss on the cheek when they meet. In France, the double-
cheek quick kiss is part of the national identity. If your date leans for-
ward at the end of your time together and quick kisses you on the cheek,
say a quick goodbye. Though a major smooch session may be coming
later, it’s the last thing on your date’s mind tonight.
If, on the other hand, your date quick kisses you hello, especially if it’s
more sweet than scary or sexy, you’re picking up on some fairly serious
chemistry.
 Serious kiss: This is a kiss you can see coming. Your date has been
preparing the proper approach in his or her mind, and there’s a thrilling
tingle of anticipation in the air. A serious kiss is one of intention. It’s sen-
sual more than sexual and takes time when done properly. A serious kiss
is one of the best signs that your date can’t wait to see you again.
 Making out: All about lust, making out is an earnest lip-lock intended as
a prelude to something more — not always sex . . . though the promise
and possibility of sex are definitely part of the scene. Making out is char-
acterized by a full-body experience. Your lips are only the initiators.
Making out uses the hands, hot breath on the neck, bodies pressed
together. Warning: Don’t make out with a date you don’t want to see
again. It sends out a mixed message, as well as a mess of hormones that
have nowhere to go.
In general, men view kissing as a prelude to the main event: sex. For men, a
woman who kisses well promises to be a tiger in the sack, too.
Women often see kissing as a perfectly good activity in and of itself, rather
than a means to an end. Women could kiss all night, and then say goodnight
without feeling “cheated” out of sex. For women, a guy who’s a “great kisser”
is a guy who takes his time, a guy who’s capable of love as well as lust.
The signs
First kisses are so loaded with possibility, expectation, sexuality, sensuality,
tenderness, and emotion, it’s a wonder people don’t explode on the spot.
Before you get to the door, or to the moment of truth, I want you to make
sure your date is sending all the right signals that he or she is ready to take
your relationship to level two.
183
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time

Her signs
You can tell that a woman is interested in a kiss if
 She’s facing you, arms down, body relaxed.
 Her head is tilted upward.
 She doesn’t appear to be ending the date with some definitive remark
like, “Thanks. I’ll call you.”
 Her lips are parted.
 She gazes into your eyes.
If she’s not interested, she’ll
 Clamp her jaw shut.
 Fumble for her keys.
 Won’t look you in the eye.
 Glue her chin to her chest.
 Hold out her hand and say, “Thanks.”
His signs
A guy looking forward to a little lip action will
 Position his body between you and the door.
 Act nervous.
 Show no visible signs of leaving or ending the date.
 Tilt his head upward.
 Lick his lips.
If he’s not interested, he’ll
 Walk you directly to your door or car, without hesitation.
 Keep his hands in his pockets.
 Look at his feet.
 Avoid eye contact at all costs.
Remember, kissing is not a mandatory end to every date. You can hug, shake
hands, wave at each other. There are other perfectly acceptable alternatives.
It’s your date, and you can kiss if you want to . . . or not kiss if you don’t.
184
Part V: The Date 

What about sex on the first date?
On a first date, sex should be out of the question. You’re just getting to know
each other, emotions are running hot, your head may be swimming in infatua-
tion hormones — not an ideal time to take such a dramatic physical and emo-
tional step. Which is what sex really is.
There are several really compelling reasons not to have sex on a first date:
 Health: In addition to AIDS, there are a lot of sexually transmitted dis-
eases, or STDs, running rampant out there: chlamydia, genital warts,
syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes (a virus you’re stuck with for life).
Another STD you don’t hear too much about is hepatitis C, an incurable
virus that causes a liver infection.
185
Chapter 14: Having a Way Cool Time
How to kiss
A first kiss, whether you’re 15 or 50, is thrilling,
sweet, nerve-wracking, intimate, awkward, and
incredibly vulnerable — all in the first five sec-
onds. Forget about what you’ve seen in the
movies (show biz kisses are well-rehearsed —
mostly so the kissers don’t cover up each other’s
faces) or on stage (actors sometimes skip the lips
and kiss between the lower lip and the chin to
preserve the actress’ lipstick!). You’ll bump noses
and knock teeth and giggle nervously as well as
feel tingly all over — which is all perfectly okay.
Though there is no “right” way to kiss, here are
a few pointers to help you successfully land a
lip-lock:
 Check out your date’s body language.
Some signs your date is kiss-ready: head
tilted up, eye contact, uncrossed arms,
body facing you.
 As soon as you decide to go for it, do it.
Hovering near some girl or guy’s lips will
only make both of you freak out.
 Maintain eye contact on the way to your
date’s lips. Don’t shut your eyes until you
arrive, or you may get lost on the way.
 Start gently. Press your lips sweetly against
your date’s. Save the tongue action for later.
 Pull back. Gaze into your date’s eyes. If it’s a
go, you’ll know by the way he or she looks
longingly back at you. If not, smile and say
goodnight, and your face will be nicely saved.
 The second lip-press is when you can go
French. This means tongue. This doesn’t
mean gagging your date or thrusting home
or swallowing his or her tongue as soon as
it darts into your mouth. Instead, gingerly
part your lips and venture forth.
A light, flickering touch with your tongue
can produce major results. The tongue is a
cluster of nerve-endings. Imagine “caress-
ing” your date’s tongue and lips and mouth.
 Don’t overdo it. Variety — kissing the eye-
lashes, neck, nibbling on the lips — is the
spice that flavors all great kissing.

 Translation: Sex doesn’t always mean the same thing to men and
women. You may think it’s no big deal but your partner is mentally pick-
ing out china patterns. You simply need more than one date to make
sure you’re both headed in the same direction.
 Exposure: On nearly every level, sex is about exposure. You’re (at least
partially) naked. You’re opening your body and a piece of your soul to
another person. Major stuff, not to be entered into lightly.
 Intimacy: Sex is a very intimate act. Even if it feels more physical to you,
it’s a primal union that opens up all sorts of emotional nooks and cran-
nies you may not even know you had. The intimacy of sexuality is a pow-
erful, loving, amazing thing. It’s to be nurtured and cherished, not taken
lightly.
For more info on the timing and impact of sex on a relationship, see Chapter 22.
Post-Datem
You said goodnight and locked the door behind you. Her sweet kiss is still on
your lips, or his whisper of affection is still warm in your ear. This was a first
date that will go down in the annals of dating. It was so delicious you can still
taste it. It’s now time for the post-datem.
Gaining a little perspective
Every date has one — a sort of “after” date where you relive each moment
that happened in the hours before. Think Sandra Dee in baby-doll pajamas
writing passionately in her diary. Or Frankie Avalon singing to the stars on a
moonlit beach. This is the post-datem. I must warn you, it’s a very precarious
time. Memory can magnify both the good and the bad. By morning, you’ll
believe you were out with either Adonis or The Monster from the Blue
Lagoon or one of the Desperate Housewives or just somebody desperate. Or
worse, you’ll be convinced you single-handedly ruined what was potentially
the love match of your life. None are true.
A date is a series of moments, looks, exchanges, sighs, touches, blunders,
brilliance, possibilities, disappointments, and delights. It’s subliminal, on the
surface, conscious, and unconscious. It’s the apex of your past experiences
and the launching pad for the future. It’s an emotional and intellectual stew.
No single moment either made or broke your date. Even if your date swears
it’s true (“The moment you said you like pizza, I knew it was love”), it’s not.
186
Part V: The Date 

I know it’s hard to do, but in your post-datem, I want you to put your date
into perspective. You don’t have to squash your lover’s high just when you’re
feeling so good, but remember what I mentioned earlier: A date is just a date.
If you take it too seriously, you’re in for both heartaches and headaches.
Instead, when you get home from your date, I want you to take a deep breath
and relax. Don’t decide that you blew it — or that you want your best friend
to be your maid of honor at the wedding.
Chilling out
Take ten minutes to calm down. Give yourself the same gift you gave yourself
before your date — a toe-to-head wave of relaxation. Clench and release
your body parts in this order: toes, calves, thighs, buttocks, abs, biceps,
shoulders, neck, and face. Progressively tighten each muscle, then release,
and do it twice. (See Chapter 12 for details on this technique.)
If you think it’s going to be hard to sleep, write down what you’re feeling
and, later, you can burn, flush, or preserve the record for your unborn 
grandkids.
Doesn’t that feel good? Now you’re ready to go to sleep and dream and wake
up tomorrow to evaluate your date in the cold light of day and decide where
you want to go from here.

L
et’s face it — everyone isn’t going to like you; you’re not going to like
everyone. That’s life. Admittedly, it doesn’t feel terrific when someone
would rather not see you again, but it’s only one person, one person’s opin-
ion, one date on planet Earth. The ground doesn’t have to tremble or swallow
you up to put you out of your misery. Lighten up. Actually, a semi-awful date
can be a gift from the gods of dating, an opportunity to take a look at your-
self, your expectations, the signals you send out, the people you pick to date,
your behavior, your level of relaxation, and your ability to communicate who
you really are.
This chapter is a look at the stomach-churning, gut-wrenching, queasy possi-
bility that you haven’t knocked ’em dead — that the whole thing has turned
deadly for them but not for you. The trick is not to become overly sensitive
or obtuse. The last thing I want you to do is sit across from your date scan-
ning his or her body language to determine if the date is a dud. Dating
requires a leap of faith that the two of you can have a good time together for
an hour or two. Think positive. Enter any dating situation with the expecta-
tion that a fun time will be had by all. Reevaluate, if necessary, if evidence to
the contrary bubbles up.
Life isn’t a mood ring. I’m going to give you some warning signs, but context is
everything when evaluating whether your date is having a good time or would
rather be home with a pint of Häagen-Dazs. A yawn can be the end of a really
tough week as well as boredom. Looking at your watch doesn’t always mean
you can’t wait to get the heck out of there — it can be an old habit or a new
watch. Lack of eye contact may mean your date is shy rather than sneaky or

unwilling to let you see how much fun they’re not having. A stumbling conver-
sation may simply be faulty social skills or nerves rather than an unwillingness
to expend air or thought on you. Use all your senses — including your sixth
sense, intuition — to evaluate what your date is really trying to convey. Relax
a bit.
Me, Paranoid?
Should you sense that your date is less than thrilled with you, undoubtedly the
question will arise, “Am I right, or am I paranoid?” Good question. Dating is an
emotional experience. You’re vulnerable. You’re letting someone you barely
know see the real you. Pretty scary stuff. It’s only natural that you might feel 
a little insecure. You may misread nuances or misinterpret a yawn or a glance
at a watch as a sure sign that you’re on the verge of a dating meltdown — 
especially if you’ve had any dating disasters in the past (who hasn’t?). But this
may not be the case at all. Sometimes a yawn really is just insomnia. Glancing
at a watch — well, some people need to get up early the next morning, even
when they’ve had a great time the night before. So before you write this date
off, find out if you really are being paranoid by asking yourself these questions:
 Was I dreading this date?
 Did I figure it probably wouldn’t work out before the date even started?
 Am I trying to decipher the “hidden meaning” in everything my date says?
 Am I obsessed with how I come off?
 Does my date keep protesting that he or she was misunderstood?
 Has anyone ever told me before that I’m oversensitive?
 Has anyone ever called me “paranoid” before?
 What’s reality and what’s delusional — do I need a new date or serious
medication?
If you answered “yes” to most of the questions, you may need to do a reality
check before you dismiss this date. Or you may be too fearful to date at all.
See whether the answers you yourself give would make sense if your best
friend were telling the story. Would you be calm or dialing for the para-
medics? If you wouldn’t see anything all that alarming in these answers if
they were your friend’s, you’ve probably passed your own test, and it’s time
to shift the focus from you to your date.

Part V: The Date 

Reading the Signs
It’s easy to tell when someone hates your guts. They sneer, they scowl, they
scoff, they storm off in a huff. They won’t make eye contact, they mace you,
they call their Rottweiler and the fashion police. Unless we’re talking major
meltdown or atomic winter, it is really unlikely that the clues will be so obvi-
ous. What is much more likely when a date goes sour is a slow process of dis-
connection, a major lack of chemistry that becomes more apparent as the date
ticks on, rather than dramatic magnetic repulsion. Here are the six warning
signs of potential date disaster:
 Lack of eye contact: Eye contact is the very essence of connection, the
“window to the soul.” If your date won’t make eye contact — nothing
else will connect.
 Sullenness: Your date is unresponsive and says as little as possible. Make
sure that you’re not monopolizing the conversation or asking too many
personal questions, but if your date consistently responds with “Yeah,”
“No,” and “Don’t know,” you have a pretty clear sign that things are not
going well. This doesn’t mean there will never be a gap of silence (or two
or three), but when the gaps yawn like the Grand Canyon, something isn’t
working.
 The “I” focus: If your date’s conversation is focused exclusively on him-
or herself, without any apparent interest in you, it’s a sign of either no
interest in you or a pre-occupation with self. Yech.
 Emotionally out of sync: Have you ever been with somebody who
totally “gets it?” Every nuance, every joke, every raised eyebrow? You’re
in tune. Conversely, if you find yourself laughing alone a lot during your
date, explaining punch lines, or finding humor where your date finds
horror (or worse, nothing), you and your date are likely really different
and are going to have a rough time finding any common emotional
ground.
 Physically out of sync: A body speaks volumes of feelings. Connected,
interested people lean in toward each other or sit close to one another. If
one body consistently says, “I’m out of here,” or “Not interested” and
remains aloof throughout the date, it’s a fair bet the head feels the same
thing.
 Edgy or anxious or sad: A wee bit of nerves are understandable, but if
your date is in an obvious emotional turmoil that doesn’t let up, it’s a
sign that your time together is in the dumps, too.
191
Chapter 15: Your Date Hates You

Getting More Info
When you feel disaster in your gut, or see it in your date’s response, bring it
to your lips. I don’t pretend this is always easy to do, but, trust me on this:
It’s better to know than to stumble around in ignorance. If you feel like your
date is not going well, here are some things you may want to say:
 “I’m sensing you’re not having a good time. Is this true?”
 “I’d appreciate your honesty. Are you having fun?”
 “Is there something I’ve said or done to offend you?”
 “Are we not quite clicking here?”
The truth isn’t always fun to hear. Sometimes it’s downright painful. But,
when you give people the chance to be honest with you, they usually will in a
kind and gentle way. You don’t want to date someone who doesn’t want to
date you. It’s as simple as that. You don’t want to have to convince someone
to like you, or ask them to hang in until chemistry kicks in. This is not an
endurance test or some dating karmic reincarnation where you’re doomed to
repeat every awful experience and where your cosmic score in each category
is added up and totaled at the end before you can escape.
A date is an organic process as much as it is planning and prep work. Mother
Nature is in there orchestrating the event, right alongside your careful blue-
print for the perfect outing. Sometimes you just have to chalk it up to fate —
this date wasn’t meant to be. Find out what went awry — don’t blame your-
self or your date. Then move on. Don’t obsess about why it didn’t work out.
Try not to take it too personally. Most importantly, no whining.
No Whining!
If you’ve ever been in a long line on a hot, sweaty day, with a bunch of tired
little kids, you probably know what whining is all about. It’s annoying, cloy-
ing, tiring, and, most of all, unproductive. Whining never gets you anywhere
but on someone’s nerves. Don’t do it. If your date tells you he or she is
having a rotten time, suck it up. Yeah, you’re right. It hurts, but no whining. It
isn’t the end of the world. All of the following constitute the whine response:
 “Just my luck.”
 “My last date dumped me, too.”
 “Boy, I sure do know how to pick ’em, don’t I?”
 “This always happens just when I start liking someone.”
192
Part V: The Date 

If you feel these words — or their ilk — bubbling to the surface, stop immedi-
ately, press your lips together and refuse to speak again until you’ve shed
that whole sackcloth-and-ashes routine and are ready to respond like the
mature person (not victim!) you are. The time to lick your wounds is later,
when you’re home running a hot bubble bath, or calling your mom for a hug
or a best friend for support or the bakery to see if they have any double
fudge brownies left.
Ending on a Positive Note
Your job, when your date isn’t dazzled by you, is to listen gracefully and non-
defensively and smile sweetly and make a swift exit as soon as the coast is
clear. No need to prolong a bad date.
One of the biggest pitfalls to a date that feels like it’s heading downhill is the
“snowball effect” — you sense something’s wrong, you panic, you clam up,
you overreact, and it just makes matters worse. Suddenly, a not-great date is
on its way to disasterville. If things are really awful, it makes more sense to
call a polite and gentle halt rather than hurt someone’s feelings for hours or
waste your time or your date’s time. It really is okay to say, “You don’t seem
to be having a good time. Shall we just chalk this up to experience?” Be
honest. ’Fess up. Stop the snowball before it becomes an avalanche and
buries you both. Ignoring an overwhelming feeling; trying to hide, squash,
cover up, or pretend it isn’t there; or wishing it weren’t there isn’t going to
change the reality. You’re not responsible for your feelings, just your behav-
ior. If you can gently acknowledge your feelings, you can deal with them.
193
Chapter 15: Your Date Hates You
Don’t I know you from somewhere?
A male friend of mine was fixed up on a blind
date by a couple he’d known for ten years. He
was excited. Divorced two years, he’d only
been on sporadic dates since. So he got himself
all spiffed-up and showed up at the woman’s
front door precisely on time. As soon as she
opened the door, however, the date went south.
Taking one look at him, her face fell. Even
though she made a quick recovery, he saw 
her disappointment. Conversation was stilted,
which made him feel even worse. When she
excused herself to make a “quick phone call,”
he was convinced she was complaining about
him to their mutual friend. Dinner was agony as
his insecurities mounted. Finally he blurted out,
“What have I done to make you hate me?”
She admitted that it wasn’t his appearance, but
the fact that she had coincidentally been in
group therapy with his ex-wife. My friend’s date
recognized him immediately from her descrip-
tion of the unusual color of his eyes and height
and felt that she knew too many intimate details
of his previous marriage to approach the rela-
tionship with an open heart. Both would have
been spared some anguish if she’d blurted out,
“Weren’t you married to Mary Jo?”

A lousy date isn’t a reason to inflict pain on either of you. It isn’t necessary to
hang in there and finish what you started. It’s okay to say, “I think we should
call it a night.” It’s also okay to use that universal come-down line almost all
daters have heard at least once, “I think we should just be friends.” Not every
couple has chemistry. That’s what dates are for — to find out.
Hey, chemistry happens, or it doesn’t. It can’t be faked or manufactured. The
feeling is out of your hands. If your date says he or she just doesn’t feel any
chemistry between the two of you, don’t take it personally, but also don’t
assume a few more hours will make a whole lot of difference. While it’s true
that a deep love can develop slowly over time, this is a date, not an arranged
marriage. Chemistry up-front is helpful on both sides for future promise; it
gives you both motivation to explore further — unless it’s so overwhelming
that you both ignore every other part of what might be going on between the
two of you. Overwhelming initial passion can move you both at the speed of
light past things you ought to be assessing slowly and carefully (see Chapter
21 on taking things slow). Don’t worry too much if you’re not turned on as
long as you’re not turned off.
Tuition for Dating 101
If your date goes down the drain, give yourself a break. It happens. Life is a
curve ball, an off-speed pitch, a fast ball low and inside. Even Ted Williams
struck out more often than he hit a home run. It may feel lousy right now, but
remind yourself, once again, it’s only one date. You’ll have tons more nights
on which you can strut your stuff. Use the experience to learn something 
so it won’t happen again. An autopsy is a great idea. The date died — figure
out why. Answering the following questions in your dating notebook (see
Chapter 1) can help you figure out what went wrong.
Answer these questions as soon as you can after the date ends, when your
impressions are still fresh. By keeping these notes, you can begin to look for
patterns in your behavior (see Chapter 4).
Tomorrow, after a few hours have passed between tonight’s date and the rest
of your life, I want you to reread your responses and see if they say anything
to you. Don’t pass judgment; don’t look for hidden meaning. Simply read
through and see what it says. If you haven’t already, read Chapter 6 for tips
on how to attract great dates into your life. For now, give yourself a nonchem-
ical treat (unless it’s chocolate), take a deep breath, prop your feet up, and
chill out.
First, at the top of a sheet of notebook paper, write your date’s name, the
date (day, month, year) and time of the date, and where you went. Also note
when and where you first met. Then on a scale from 1 to 10 (0 = meltdown; 
10 = divine), rate the date as a whole.
194
Part V: The Date 

From there, reflect on the date and answer the following questions. Make
sure you’re being really specific here (for example, nice smile when we met,
good table manners, well-groomed).
 What positive stuff happened? In what ways did the date go well?
 What was icky poo poo? In what ways did the date stink?
 What were your expectations? (Tip: See if you can make yourself aware
of what disappointed you, which will instantly focus on what you
expected.)
 Were your expectations based on how someone acted before?
 What patterns emerge that you have noticed on previous dates, in the
other relationship? Is this déjà vu all over again?
Now reflect on your current feelings.
 How are you feeling right now?
 What do you want to do? For example, do you want to try again, talk to a
friend, join a monastery, reread the whole book, take a vacation from
dating?
 What can you do differently on your next date to offset this problem and
change the pattern?
 Did you feel that your date saw the real you, yes or no? If no, why not?

Chapter 15: Your Date Hates You
It’s chemistry
Chemistry is mentioned a lot when two people
click. “I just knew,” “It was love at first sight,”
“We were destined to be together,” “Soul
mates” . . . 
Beware. While some couples feel an instant and
powerful pull to one another (which isn’t always
sustainable or prolonged), for most, the response
is slower and subtler. An interest. A tingle. A thrill.
A desire to get closer. In a word: chemistry.
A number of physiological changes take place
in your body when you encounter a person who
turns you on. Your pupils dilate (you want to see
more of them), your heart races, your palms get
sweaty. You feel energized, like you could stay
up all night. And you probably could — that’s
what the expression “turned on” really means.
Physically, your body is totally awake, alert, 
and raring to go — basic biochemistry 101.
Hormones turn you on — lust in its most basic,
uncomplicated, thrilling form. Your body is
saying, “Let’s party.”
Unfortunately, as convenient as it would some-
times be to be able to bottle it, chemistry is either
there, or it’s not — and it’s impossible to fake.

Answering these questions after every not-so-hot date and/or journaling
about your experiences can help you learn from rather than focus on less
than successful dates. But please avoid sending a “this is why you shouldn’t
have treated me badly” letter to your date, which falls into the whining cate-
gory I address earlier in this chapter. Every once in a while, in an effort to
save face and salvage some remnant of dignity, you may be tempted to con-
tact your date explaining why you deserve better or how the creep hurt your
feelings. Resist this urge. You should never put anything into a letter or e-mail
that you are not willing to have advertised on the front page of The New York
Times. Even something like “have a nice life” can sound sarcastic. I know you
may be hurting, but don’t write down your feelings anyplace, except for a
diary that no one else will see.

T
he assumption in this chapter is that your date seems to be having a
good time and you are definitely not (see Chapter 15 if the situation is
reversed — that is, you’re having a good time and your date isn’t — and if
both of you are miserable, see Chapter 17). Hey, it happens. Though there’s
always at least some fun to be had on a date with anyone, not every date you
go on will be one for the scrapbook. That’s okay. You can learn as much
about yourself and your likes and dislikes from a date that fizzles as you can
from one that’s sizzling hot. Dating, by its very nature, is getting to know
someone better. Naturally, you’re not going to hit it off with everyone, nor
will everyone hit it off with you. That’s just human interaction. Learning how
to bow out gracefully, that’s human kindness — and the topic of this chapter.
Making It to the (Not) Bitter End
Doing the right thing and letting your bad news date naturally run its course
will score you several Brownie points with the great Datemaster in the sky. If
you believe in karma, an act of generosity will be returned to you someday.
Don’t get me wrong — I’m not saying you should grit your teeth and bear it
until the clock strikes twelve and you can safely call it a date. What I am
saying is that there are ways to make the best of a not-so-hot situation.
Deploying survival strategies
If you’re not having a good time but your date is, give these strategies a try.
Not only can they get you through the evening, but they give you the oppor-
tunity to discover interesting and worthwhile things about your date and
yourself — and that’s never a waste of time.

 Identify three things you like about your date. Everyone has at least a
few interesting and unique qualities.
When a date starts to slide downhill, we tend to magnify the negative
moments in our minds and discount the positive. Reverse this trend:
Find three things you like about your date. They don’t have to be big
things. You don’t have to suddenly realize you love this person’s person-
ality. Start small. Do you like her hair? His hands? Her laugh? His quirky
sense of humor?
 Become a good listener. View this as a great opportunity to sharpen
your listening skills. Stay in the moment. Don’t second-guess what you
could have possibly done here or worry about what you’re going to tell
your friends or how you’re going to get a good night’s sleep. Really listen
to what your date has to say — without judgment. You may hear some-
thing interesting.
 Relax and tune in to your surroundings. Enjoy the food, the atmosphere,
the popcorn, the movie, the biscotti, the sunshine, the snow, the sound of
bowling pins falling each time you score a strike. Shift your focus away
from a date that’s not working out to all the things that are perfectly fine.
Avoiding blame
Understandably, you’re going to feel disappointed when you first get the
inkling that your date isn’t working out. Either people click, or they don’t.
When they click, their communication is like a tapestry — each shared 
experience and similarity intertwines. Each giggle, stare, brush of a hand
is a gossamer thread, one on top of the other, until a beautiful scene is
depicted. When folks don’t click, the date is more like a wrinkly paper bag —
uninteresting, unappealing, and just plain un-wonderful. When you discover
that the situation has gone south, don’t be tempted to blame your date or
yourself for the unpleasantness — no need to accuse your date of
 Using you
 Being an idiot
 Being ungrateful
 Being uncivilized
Sometimes two perfectly nice people can just not mesh very well. If you take
that perspective, you don’t have to take offense or blame or a position — just
take a deep breath.
Being polite
Your mom has explained the need for good manners: to avoid making another
person feel bad. Well, your date may not be going as well as you wanted, but
198
Part V: The Date 

now is not the time to abandon all those skills that your parents spent a life-
time drilling into you. The basics of being polite include the following:
 Stay put. No leaving out the back door, faking a headache, or spending the
entire date in the restroom reading phone numbers carved into the wall.
 Have a conversation. Sitting stone-faced is the ultimate slap in the face.
Find something to talk about even if you discover you two are worlds
apart. Seen any good movies lately?
 Maintain eye contact. You don’t need to gaze into your date’s eyes, cer-
tainly, but staring up at the ceiling is rude.
 Listen. Your date may not notice that things aren’t going swimmingly.
Tuning this person out will only cause him or her to try harder to reach
you, and panic isn’t pretty.
 Make nice. As Elvis said, “Don’t be cruel.” Your date didn’t kidnap you. If
things aren’t going well, so be it. Without being overly encouraging (you
don’t want a bad date hoping for bad date number two), be civil and kind.
 See your date home. It’s impolite to abruptly end your date the moment
the check is paid, the ending credits roll, or the coffee cup is empty. You
don’t need to prolong it, but you do need to finish what you both started.
If you drove, drive your date home. If your date drove, accept a ride home.
Share a cab, a subway, a bus ride. No bolting or escaping is necessary.
 Behave as you’d like to be treated. Show common courtesy. Smile,
laugh at jokes, and avoid rolling your eyes to the back of your head. The
goal here is to be kind without being dishonest.
The key to being polite is to think of yourself as Lord or Lady Bountiful —
much too well-bred to let on that your bunions pinch or your fine sense of
smell has just discerned that something has died. The goal of being polite is
not to lead your date on, but to treat your date with the same kindness and
respect with which you’d treat anyone.
Proclaiming Truth: Honesty Is
a Tricky Policy
There you are sitting across from a date who’s eager and hopeful and try-
ing her or his best to engage you. This person is perfectly nice. Perfectly
acceptable. Perfectly wrong for you. For whatever reason, you know it’s not
going to work out. How, then, do you let your date down easy? Be honest . . .
without harming the poor, unfortunate soul unnecessarily.
Truth-telling is a tricky bit of business. In the guise of “truth,” many a hurt
has been inflicted. Do you really need to tell someone he or she is fat, even if
that is the case? Do you need to say, “No, your nose isn’t big; it’s huge”?
199
Chapter 16: You Hate Your Date

Using tact
The difference between hurtful truth-telling and honesty is four letters:
tact. The best way to be tactful is to put yourself in your date’s shoes. If you
wouldn’t want to hear it, your date most likely won’t want to hear it, either.
To help you out of any potential corner into which you might paint yourself
during a date gone sour, Table 16-1 provides a list of some tactful translations.
Table 16-1
Tactful Translations
How You Really Feel
Tactful Translation
I want to go home now.
Gee, it sure is getting late, and I’ve got an
early morning tomorrow.
You bore me to tears.
Please excuse my yawning; it’s been a really
tough week.
We have nothing in common.
You’ve led such a different life than I have!
You sure seemed nicer when 
There are so many sides to your personality.
I asked you out.
What a waste of time!
I’ve been in such a time crunch these days, I
never have time for the fun stuff.
You look nothing like your picture.
Your photo doesn’t do you justice.
Why don’t you say something 
You seem quiet — are you okay?
instead of just sitting there?
Are you ever going to shut up?
You’re so full of energy!
I never want to see you again.
Tonight has been an experience. Thank you.
Telling the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, sort of . . .
The one time you really do want to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth is when your date asks, “Can I call you?” — or worse, “Will you
call me?” The phone thing is fraught with nearly every conceivable emotion —
hope, fear, anxiety, trust, excitement, rejection, and anticipation.
Now is the moment to take a deep breath and tell the truth. It’s not fair to
leave her waiting by a phone that refuses to ring or have him logging on to
check his e-mail every few hours. If you’re not going to call, now or in the 
200
Part V: The Date 

millennium, don’t say you will. Period. It’s not cool. It’s not fair. It’s not what
polite, respectful people do. That said, here are a few tactful ways to get the
message across:
 “Though I had fun tonight, I don’t think it’s going to work out between us.”
 “To be honest, I see you as more of a friend.”
 “We’re just too different, you and I.”
 “I don’t want to mislead you by telling you I’ll call. I’m sorry, but I proba-
bly won’t.”
 “I’m going to be really busy at work for the next couple of months.”
 “Family concerns are going to keep me tied up.”
It’s tough. No two ways about it. Everyone wants to believe in love and union
and two souls who were meant to be together. But if this isn’t that scene,
don’t make it even worse by lying and leading your date to believe it might
one day be.
Handling Hurt Feelings
Rejection is just someone’s opinion. You don’t like everyone, and not every-
one is going to like you. Don’t allow your discomfort to make you mean.
Stringing someone along, pretending you like him or her when you really
don’t, is cowardly and cruel. In the long run, you’ll inflict more pain by pre-
tending, which is really to protect yourself. Pretending is much harsher than
saying upfront that this isn’t working for you. If your date is smitten, the truth
is going to pinch a bit but for less time or intensity than if you lie.
You’ve been honorable, have asked your date out, or have been asked out on
the assumption of potential good stuff. You’ve now discovered things aren’t
working out. No need to push the guilt button. No one likes to hurt anyone’s
feelings. It’s important to be humane and human: When the news is hard to
break and hard to take, be aware of what you’re feeling and why, and be spe-
cific about why it’s not working for you without being judgmental. Unless you
are incredibly adept at letting your date down gently (how did you get so
much practice? We may need to talk), you’re very likely going to hurt feel-
ings. When you do:
 Acknowledge your date’s rights to feelings. Don’t pretend everything is
okay or get defensive if your date lashes out or is upset. Listen quietly
and patiently.
 Don’t try to fix it. These are your date’s feelings, not yours. You deal
with your feelings, and let your date do the same.
201
Chapter 16: You Hate Your Date

 Apologize for the hurt, not the fact. Not liking someone isn’t a crime.
You didn’t do anything wrong. As a human being, you feel bad when
another human being feels bad, but when you start down the “sorry”
road, the next thing you may find yourself doing is trying to make it up
to your date. Don’t start down that slippery slope.
 Let go. Ultimately, you have to make peace with the whole situation by
realizing another fact of life: Not every date is terrific any more than
every meal is wonderful, every sunset grand, or every flavor chocolate.
Chalking It Up to Experience
You can learn something from every experience. Sometimes the tuition is
high, and sometimes it’s not. If you view this date as a learning experience
rather than dashed hopes, a waste of time and money, or a night you could
have spent watching ER, the entire date will feel very different. After all,
 It’s only one night (day, afternoon, hour).
 It never has to happen again.
 This date can help you figure out what you want or don’t want next time.
The best way to avoid making another mistake is to figure out specifically
what went wrong this time. After the date is over, after you’re home and reliv-
ing the scenario in your mind (or trying to get it out of your mind), take out
your dating notebook (see Chapter 1) and make two columns on a piece of
paper: “What I was originally attracted to” and “What totally turned me off.”
List everything you can think of in each column. Be honest. No one is looking.
You can burn or flush this list later. Even if what originally attracted you was
her Baywatch bod and what turned you off was the fact that Baywatch is her
favorite TV show, write it down. Write it all down. When you’re finished,
you’ll have a much clearer picture of exactly what went awry . . . and how to
avoid making the same mistake next time.
202
Part V: The Date 
Please, don’t do me any favors!
I know a man in his 50s who’s been dating a
woman in her 50s for the past three years. Their
relationship perplexes everyone who knows
them. They seem miserable together: always
snipping at each other, forever on the verge of
breaking up. But they never do.
One day, when the man was telling me about his
latest lover’s spat, I finally asked him why he
didn’t just leave her. “I don’t want to hurt her
feelings,” he said.
It stuck in my mind so clearly because, just the
day before, his girlfriend had told me he was the
most hurtful man she’d ever known. “He only
pretends to care about me,” she said.
Life seems awfully short for this kind of nonsense.

B
ad dates happen. Just as a movie trailer sometimes looks so good you
can’t wait to see the film and then the film is a real stinker, bad dates
can look great in preview and then pale in reality. It’s nobody’s fault. This
date just wasn’t in the cards. Time to shuffle on to the next date.
Really, this is the second-best dating scenario. Optimally on a date, the two of
you hit it off and have a great time. Barring that, it’s much better that both of
you realize your date was a washout. No one gets hurt. No one has to be the
rejector or the rejectee. You can shake hands and say, “Good luck,” and go on
your merry way, which is perfectly fine.
Facing Facts
A date is a level three experience: Level one is meeting someone, talking on
the phone, chatting online, staring longingly at the back of his or her head all
semester in class. On level one, there’s enough of a connection and attraction
to warrant venturing into level two. Level two is a little pre-date interaction
(see Chapter 7), which gets pretty quickly to level three, the date.
Unless this is a totally blind date, meaning you’re set up with someone you’ve
never even spoken to before, it’s safe to say there are at least some good feel-
ings passing back and forth between the two of you before your date begins.
Once the date gets going, however, the connection and attraction will be
tested and tried on for size — from both sides. Liking or not liking each other
is rarely an instant evaluation. Luckily, most of us are willing to give somebody

a bit more time because we’d like them to give us a bit more of a chance, too.
Deciding whether you want to invest a bit more time and effort in getting to
know someone is a process of evaluating lots of verbal and nonverbal cues.
Speed bumps
Everything you and your date say and do from the moment you meet is
recorded and processed and filed in both of your brains. Unless you turn
each other off from the get-go (see the later section “Total turnoffs”), a sense
of dissatisfaction, disappointment, and unease usually builds until you real-
ize, “Uh-oh, this date isn’t working out. I’m definitely not having fun, and I
don’t want to be here.”
The tricky thing is making sure it’s not just nerves or fear or shyness or arro-
gance that’s convinced you guys you’re having a rotten time. So first — a
quick reality check. Ask yourself these questions:
 Am I relaxed, or am I tense and fearful?
Being vulnerable and letting another human being get close can be very
scary stuff. Just like any other animal, scared humans sometimes lash out
to keep other “threatening” animals at bay, or they retreat to the safety of
their cave or shell. Perhaps this is what both of you are doing right now.
If you’re so tense that your true personality is hidden beneath a mass of
knotted muscles, your date may dislike the tension, not you. You’re not
allowing the real you to emerge. If you feel completely stressed-out, take
a few deep breaths or excuse yourself to the restroom and do three min-
utes of square breathing (see Chapter 2).
 Is my date relaxed?
The same standard that applies to you (see the preceding item) applies to
your date. Your date may be so wracked with nerves that every response
is stilted, every laugh forced, every reaction pretentious. Stress doesn’t
make anyone likable. Do what you can to make your date feel comfortable:
Be friendly, initiate conversation, pull back a little. Try not to judge the
success or failure of your date until things get a bit more relaxed.
 Is it something my date said?
Sometimes, one careless remark can send a whole date careening down-
hill. A friend of mine, who’d just changed the color of her hair, had a
date attempt to make a joke. “Did they have a sale on red?” he asked her.
Understandably, she was insulted, but she didn’t say anything. Later her
date told me he found her “cold and distant.” She thought he had the
class of a slug. Both were probably just really nervous. Human beings
are complex creatures. One dumb remark does not a personality make.
Make sure there’s sufficient evidence to write the whole thing off. It’s
perfectly okay to say, “Wow, that comment seemed kind of hostile.”
204
Part V: The Date 

Make sure you’re not letting other, relatively minor things like imperfect table
manners, height, weight, sense of humor, style, driving habits, or dancing
ability (or lack thereof) trigger a turnoff. You’re both in a heightened emo-
tional state, and your behavior may be exaggerated. Let things settle down
before evaluating the whole date.
Total turnoffs
Although, theoretically, loathe at first sight should be no more or less
common than love at first sight, loathing isn’t always a slow-build. Here are
ways to completely turn each other off in an instant:
205
Chapter 17: You Hate Each Other
 Neglecting to shower
 Eating like a pig
 Dressing like a hooker
 Talking only about yourself
 Abusing the waiter or clerk
 Whining
 Drinking too much
 Showing up stoned
 Talking about sex
 Insulting each other
 Insulting anybody else
 Acting superior
 Being a bigot
 Copping a feel
 Taking your shoes off in the car
If you discover that you really can’t stand the person you’re with — and you
have a pretty good idea that the feeling is mutual — face the moment of truth
without wasting another moment of your precious life.
Acknowledging the Moment of Truth
So there you are. Sitting across from your date, or next to him or her, or in
the bathroom staring at your reflection, afraid to face the truth. Don’t. Face it.
If you feel unhappy and sense that your date is miserable, too, denial only
makes matters worse. Instead, do this:
 Trust your instincts. If it feels all wrong, it probably is — even if both of
you are smiling and making nice.
 Ask. There’s nothing wrong with asking your date whether what you’re
sensing is actually the truth. I wouldn’t go so far as to blurt out, “Do you
hate me as much as I hate you?” but asking if the discomfort in the air is
real is really a good start.

 ’Fess up. If your date is having as lousy a time as you are, he or she may
ask you what’s the matter. Tell the truth. Admit that things aren’t zipping
along as well as you’d hoped and ask if your date feels the same way.
 Let it be. Now is not the time to muse over what’s going wrong. If there’s
no spark, this date’s never going to jump-start, no matter how carefully
you peer under the hood.
Exiting with Style
The moment has arrived. You’ve finally faced up to the ugly truth: You’d both
rather be anywhere but together, and a root canal is sounding better by com-
parison. Resist the temptation to duck out the back, make a mad dash for the
door, or order a cab instead of dessert. The true measure of your soul is how
you handle disaster. We can all be classy when the going is good. True style
and honor come from handling bad situations well.
Don’t worry. You don’t have to sit there and imagine gnawing your foot
off so you can escape the trap. You can call this one off — but do it with
panache. Say:
 “Let’s skip coffee and chalk this up to experience.”
 “I’m ready to call it a night. You?”
 “The show (dinner, lunch, brunch, exhibit, walk) was fun. Thank you for
sharing it with me. Can I give you a lift home?” (No need to be ugly.)
 “I’m sorry things didn’t work out.”
 “Let’s toast this valiant effort and get the check.”
Again, don’t lie. Don’t say you’ll call. Don’t say you had a great time when you
didn’t. Just end the date quickly and cleanly.
206
Part V: The Date 
Five signs you really do hate each other
 A piece of cilantro is stuck to your date’s
chin, and you don’t bother to mention it.
Your date knows it’s there and doesn’t
bother to remove it.
 You both could describe every detail of the
door but don’t know what color your date’s
eyes are.
 If it were videotaped, your conversation
would make it on America’s Most Boring
Videos.
 You have to keep explaining punch lines.
 Your mouths are killing both of you from all
that fake smiling.

Reviewing Expectations
One bad date doesn’t mean much; a string of bad dates may mean a lot. If you
keep thinking this one is “the one” and are wrong again and again, it may be
time to stop, look, and listen. 
When you get home, evaluate your expectations and examine your dating
patterns. Only then can you stop making the same mistakes over and over.
Answer the following questions in your dating notebook (see Chapter 1) so
you have a basis on which to begin analysis, understanding, and change.
 What qualities must your ideal date absolutely, positively have?
 What must your ideal date not be?
 Why was this date a disaster?
 Think back to the last disaster date you had — what things went wrong
then? (If this is your first bad date, skip this question.)
 Looking back over your lists, are there any similarities between what
you put on the “My date must not be” list and the (one or) two “disaster
date” lists? If so, nail those little suckers and write them down.
Is there a pattern? Is there a pit into which you keep falling? If your ideal date
must not be rude, obese, or boring, and your disaster dates were rude, thin,
and boring, perhaps you didn’t look too far beyond the outer package when
the date was first set up. Or if all your disaster dates turn out to be so self-
involved they may as well be out with themselves, perhaps you don’t know
how to spot a narcissist early on. Don’t worry. You don’t have to keep falling
in. Tables 17-1 and 17-2 can help you spot danger signs upfront (be aware that
some pitfalls can be less than obvious).

Starting Over
The most important thing about a really bad date is making sure you don’t
obsess to the extent that you vow, “Never again.” Becoming a hermit is not
the antidote to a lousy date. Problem solving is. Figure out what you can do
differently next time and get back in the race. Figure out what went awry and
learn from the experience; you won’t have to join a religious order with a vow
of silence, solitude, and celibacy.
Don’t rush into another date with just anybody, but do put this experience in
perspective. Hey, it was one crummy date — no need to be bummed out about
it endlessly. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and get ready to date all over
again. Be thankful you both agreed on at least one thing — it didn’t work.
Beware of the Groucho Marx School of Life that says, “I wouldn’t want to
belong to any club that would accept me as a member.” In the world of
dating, this if-they’ll-have-me-I-don’t-want-them mentality translates into two
unappealing possibilities: “If they hate me, they must be really cool and have
figured out the real me” or — even worse — “Nobody rejects me first. I’ll
charm them so they’ll like me, and then I’ll reject them.” Take my advice: If it’s
lousy for both of you, let it go and be done with it. Amen.

In this part . . .
H
ang on — you’re now launched into that great gray
area between a first date and a relationship. Whoa,
boy. The day after date number one is 24 hours of fantasy,
instant replays, post-mortems. It’s a time of wonder . . . as
in “I wonder what I should do next?” The day after date
number two is similar but a bit more intense . . . as in
“What’s going to happen now?” No need to fret. I’ll help
you navigate these murky waters.
In this part, you’ll find out how to open up without con-
fessing, how to ask questions without interviewing, how
to listen without nodding off, and how to let your date get
to know the real you without scaring the dickens out of
you both. I’ll also give you a few tips on nipping this bud-
ding relationship in the bud if things aren’t meant to be.
Yeah, breaking up is hard to do, but not breaking up when
you should is much harder on everyone. So buckle up.
Hopefully, you’re in for a long, fun ride.

In This Chapter
 Making first impressions — again
 Perking up after an icky date
 Regrouping after a so-so date
 Following up on the perfect date
A
fter a first date is over, there are feelings both men and women share:
excitement (if the date went well), disappointment (if it went poorly),
and anticipation (if it went well enough to ensure date number two). And
that’s about where the similarity ends.
Forgive the sexual stereotypes, but guys really do have a whole different take
on the post-date period than women do. The difference is a fantasy thing, a
time thing — not a biological thing. It’s a part of our sociology, meaning that
guys are socialized differently than girls are. Neither side is right or wrong.
It’s just what is. Therefore, the minutes, hours, days, and weeks after a first
date are loaded with the potential for misunderstanding, miscommunication,
and mistakes from both sides.
Clearing the air by understanding what’s really going on, from both the male
and female points of view, after the first date’s over and before a second one
occurs — that’s what this chapter is all about.
Second Thoughts on First Impressions
A date-long first impression is different from the two-second once-over your
date gives you when you initially meet. It’s more than a primal, visceral thing.
Throughout the time you spend together, your date’s five senses are working
overtime — taking it all in. Processing every nuance, every sigh, every touch.
Even the stuff your date isn’t aware he or she sees, hears, smells, touches,
and tastes is seen, heard, touched, smelled, and tasted. Above and beyond

the five senses are your date’s sense of style, appropriateness, manners,
space, self — you name it. Every part of your date’s past and present being
comes into play when evaluating you and how he or she feels about you.
Yikes! No wonder we all get nervous on a first date!
What you can do if you don’t want your first impression to last a lifetime is to
create another one. As simple as that. It’s okay to call your date and say, “I
was a bit jittery last night. What do you say we try again next week?” Or you
can lay your cards right on the table by saying, “I feel like I didn’t show you
who I really am. I’d like another chance to do so.”
Honesty is appealing. Vulnerability is sexy. Unless you’re a mass of quivering
insecurity, few people can resist someone who’s human enough to admit they
didn’t show you a true picture and would like a second shot.
If your date was fantastic, no need to redo anything. If the date didn’t go as
well as expected, maybe a bit of remedial work is in order. If you have just
experienced the Guinness Book’s lousy-date record, you need to give yourself
some first aid.
After an Icky Date
The day after a disastrous date can be full of blame, guilt, shame, and copi-
ous amounts of chocolate — if you let it. Or you can take a deep breath and
call it like it is: one date that didn’t ring your chimes. Period. What I don’t
want you to do is
 Bad-mouth your date.
 Call and beg forgiveness.
 Berate yourself all day (week, month, year, life).
 Vow never to date again.
 Quickly arrange a date with just anybody to prove it’s not you that’s icky.
 Avoid feeling disappointed by overeating, over-drinking, over-drugging . . .
overdoing anything.
Look, feeling disappointed is okay. It’s a letdown when things don’t work out
as you hoped! But you can feel it without wallowing in it. You can experience
a disappointment without draping yourself in black. Most importantly, you
can forgive yourself and your date for not being a perfect match. It’s nobody’s
fault. It’s life.

Paying life’s tuition
Life is an education. At every turn, if your eyes and heart are open, you learn
about yourself, about others, about love, about survival. Your not-so-great
experiences are the tuition you pay for education; your so-great experiences
are merit scholarships.
Hideous dates, if kept in perspective, are just another lesson in your on-
going education. A lousy date isn’t the end of the world; it’s the beginning
of Dating 102.
Restoring your confidence
The worst side effect of a rotten date is the potential for ego devastation.
How can you hop back on the horse when your date said you looked, acted,
and brayed like one? What you may need the day after the date from hell is a
real confidence booster. Even if you have to work the next day, set aside at
least a teeny bit of time to do something you know you do well. Some possi-
bilities are (this is also a good list to keep in mind if your date was so-so or
even fabulous — or even if you’ve just resigned from dating forever):
 Get outside and take a walk or go golfing (even if it’s miniature) or hiking
or climb a mountain (even if it’s a molehill).
 Get some exercise — you’ll liberate endorphins, the feel-good chemicals.
 Make a gourmet meal.
 Make your mom laugh.
 Teach your old dog a new trick.

Five ways to put a hideous date in perspective

2. Thank technology for VCRs and DVD

thing while you were out.
3. Count how many days you’ve been alive.

4. Look at your watch — it just seemed like

5. Check your pulse. You survived!

 Impress your boss.
 Eat chocolate.
 Call a friend.
 Splurge on a magazine, CD, or book.
Whatever you do, make sure it’s life-affirming, fun, and filling — as in filling
you up with pride. Then forget all about your lousy date and look forward to
the next great one.
After a So-So Date
Obsessing about all the ways you could have made your so-so date so, so
much better is a waste of time. Monday-morning quarterbacking only works
in the NFL — not the dating game. The date’s over. Let it be. Unless it was a
bona fide disaster (see the preceding section), you’re probably going to get a
second chance to spiff up that first impression.
Valium for the soul
Often, when things don’t quite go as well as they could on a date, the reason
is nerves. Nerves make you laugh too hard or too little, pre-judge every word
you utter, or beat yourself up for every little faux pas. Your date was likely
nervous, too. It’s hard to be charming when your date is tense. It’s also hard
to put someone else at ease when you’re stiff and uncomfortable.
When you get home from a so-so date:
1. Sit down in a comfy chair.
2. Shut your eyes.
3. Take five deep breaths in through your nose, out through your mouth.
4. Visualize your date floating up and out of your consciousness like a
soft, fluffy cloud.
5. Repeat after me:
I am not perfect.
I don’t need to be perfect to be loved.
This was only one date.
There will be another date.
Next time I will feel safe enough to reveal more of myself.

Now, refer to the waiting-period guidelines in the section “Nine hints for
limbo and surviving the wait” later in this chapter, and get some sleep.
All the right moves
The day after a so-so date can be confusing. Do you call? Do you sit tight?
Apologize? Swear you’ll never wear that puce pantsuit again? Knowing pre-
cisely when to be passive and when to charge is hard. My general rule is this:
If your date derailed because of something you said or did, call and apolo-
gize. Everyone makes dumb mistakes. Everyone understands. It’s saying noth-
ing that leaves a bad taste with everyone.
If, on the other hand, your date just didn’t sizzle like you hoped it would for
some reason you can’t pin down, let time shed a little light on the situation.
Don’t call the next day (or that night). In fact, don’t call at all until you’re sure
of these three things:
 You want a second date because you like the person, not just because you
want to make sure they like you.
 You’ve identified what you may do differently next time, like relax, go to
a place where you can talk, not bring your mother, and so on.
 You’re not feeling so guilty and responsible that your second date
becomes a “make-up” date instead of a second chance to get to know
one another.
After the Perfect Date
After you’ve said goodnight and the ideal date has come to a close, both of
you are high on life, awash in good feelings. You grin, sigh, kiss your dog on
the top of his head, or nuzzle with your cat. If you’re a girl, you want to do
what girls do — talk about it; you want to lie down on your dorm bed or curl

1. Ask your parents if every date they ever had
was stellar.
2. List how many good moments you had.

4. Count how many Saturday nights you have

5. Rent When Harry Met Sally.

up with the phone and tell a good friend every glorious detail. If you’re a guy,
you feel all warm and fuzzy, too, but you probably carry those feelings more
internally and quietly; you do your homework, turn on the TV, wash the car,
read the paper, dribble a basketball, burp — your normal life stuff — all very
satisfied that your date was a success. You don’t need to fret. You’ve won.
Inside your heads, however, a lush fantasy is brewing. Or, I should say, two
lush fantasies. One female, one male. This is where things can get a little
sticky if you expect your date to have the very same vision that you do. See
Table 18-1 for what I mean:

See the communication problem here?
216
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Testosterone versus Estrogen Central
Really, the biggest potential for post-date communication glitches involves
time. Guy time and girl time, that is, baby. They’re not the same. Einstein was
right. It’s all relative. Here’s what happens: You go out to a great dinner or a
concert or the movies. You giggle, share popcorn. You both have a fabulous
time. Sweetly kiss goodnight. Then he whispers, “I’ll call you soon.” Or she
whispers the same. You both nod and head home.
Now, she assumes that soon means on the cell phone on the way home, at a
pay phone the next morning, or at the very latest, within the next two days.
Soon to him means “if I have a minute in my busy schedule,” “when I get that
new job,” “when I have my fall class schedule in order,” “when the football
season is over.” Or soon can mean “never,” “if my mom pressures me,” or “if
the Knicks are out of contention.” Problem city:
 Female is hovering by the phone; male is flipping channels on the
remote control.
 If she calls right away (as she said she would), he thinks, “Whoa! She’s
really into me. Sex city!” She’s really just saying, “I had a nice time and
I’d like to see you again.”
 If he calls when he gets around to it (as he said he would), she’s an ice
queen because so much time has elapsed (a week, a month, a year, a
decade). How dare he leave her hanging! Suddenly, she’s too busy to see
him again, and the budding relationship blows sky-high.
What’s wrong with this picture? In a word, the word soon.
Guys: Don’t say “soon” when you’re whispering in her ear or any other time.
Girls: Don’t believe it if he should slip. (And your being vague doesn’t help
much, either. Take it to the bank — he’ll expect a much longer passage of time
than you, most likely.) If he does say, “I’ll call you soon,” try one of these
responses:
 “I’ll be out of town for a couple of days. Could you call me after that?”
Even if you’re not leaving town, this blows that whole “waiting by the
phone” thing right out of the water.
 “How ’bout I call you in a week or so?” Then be sure to add the reason
(when finals are over, after work lets up, as soon as I accept the Nobel
Prize) so that it doesn’t sound like a brush-off. Mark at least ten days to
two weeks on your calendar and call him then.
217
Chapter 18: The Next Day

 “Instead of calling, let’s e-mail each other from work.” This narrows the
call time to 9-to-5 and takes some of the intensity out of the exchange.
E-mail is pretty public, so neither one of you can get too hot and heavy
with the boss watching.
 “What does soon mean to you?” Though this question may sound a bit
overeager, asking for a definition is okay. Your date’s response tells you a
lot about the future of this relationship. Whatever you hear, be calm;
don’t panic or get hysterical.
If you’re a guy: Don’t wait quite as long as you ordinarily would. If you do
intend to call her “soon,” you’ll score major Brownie points if you make it
more sooner than later. Women eventually write off the guy who never calls,
but they never forget the man who calls right away.
If you’re a girl: Wait at least twice as long as you ordinarily would. Give the
guy a break. When he does call, warm up that cold shoulder, or he’ll never
call again. The appropriate response to a guy who calls a week after a great
date is, “Hi. How are you?” — not “Hi. Who died?” He’ll be so pleased with
you he just may call later that night for more of your tender, loving accep-
tance. Stay cool. Don’t notice. Life is long; phone calls can be short.
The best way to avoid the whole call/don’t call scenario is to arrange date
number two before date number one ends. Plan to get together again no
sooner than a week, no later than two weeks. If your date doesn’t bring it up,
you can. No gender rules here.

Nine hints for limbo and surviving the wait
There’s a reason the first streamlined, easy-to-cradle-beneath-your-chin tele-
phone was called a “princess” phone. It was designed to be talked on for
hours in comfort — something little princes just don’t do. Sure, guys call
their buddies, but let’s face it — they look like amateurs when it comes to the
real phone talkers: girls. Girls grow up on the phone. So the day after a great
date, the telephone in a girl’s room or house or apartment or car or office
takes on a sort of golden glow. Women, if you’re not vigilant, the phone will
take over your life. Don’t let it.
Assuming you’re waiting for this great guy you met to call you for date
number two, don’t panic, don’t write him off, don’t obsess. Instead, follow
these nine guidelines for handling the waiting period:
 Don’t stop showering. I know, I know — the phone could ring while
you’re all sudsed up, and baths are quieter. But changes in lifestyle and
hygiene don’t need to begin quite so early. There are answering
machines and voice mail. People call back. Hygiene is more important.
You never know — he could drop by.
 Don’t call the phone company. If you hear a dial tone, the phone is in
perfect working order. Besides, the phone would be engaged while they
checked the line anyway, and are you willing to take that risk?
 Don’t go shopping for new equipment. You don’t need a new phone,
answering machine, beeper, doorbell, or e-mail server just because
yours refuses to ring, beep, or announce, “You have mail!” Be patient.
 Don’t put yourself on house arrest. This is not the time to develop a
deep and lasting friendship with the pizza delivery guy. Get out. Get air.
The phone will be there when you get back.
 Don’t change your answering machine message. Your old voice
sounded sexy enough. Detailing on tape exactly where you are and
where you’ll be each day is an invitation to burglars, not daters.
 Stare at something else. A watched phone never rings.
 Stop watching the 24-hour news channel. If he really was abducted by
an alien or caught in a 20-car pile-up, you’ll hear about it soon enough.
 Get a life. If you don’t have one already, now’s the time to live. Go to a
museum, volunteer, enroll in NASCAR driving camp, whatever. Carry on
with any version of existence other than an amoeba life form sitting by
the phone.
219
Chapter 18: The Next Day

 Don’t worry, be happy. Even if it’s your mom each time the phone rings,
hey, at least it’s a human voice. Remember Dr. Joy’s prescription on
dating: It’s one date. Take it easy. Nothing, besides nuclear holocaust, is
the end of the world.
Remember, women crave intensity; men crave comfort. Carry that thought
throughout your life and you’ll always understand why the other side
behaves the way it does.
Men’s ten-day rule
This ten-day rule explains why guys wait ten days to call, even if the date’s
terrific.
Assuming your first date is on a Tuesday or Wednesday night:
 Guys don’t call the next day; they see it as too needy. Girls don’t call the
next day, either; they see it as too desperate.
 Now you’re butting up against the weekend. You don’t want to appear
dateless. No one calls Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.
 Now you’re at Monday. No one calls anyone on a Monday.
 Tuesdays or Wednesdays are good days to call, but if work gets too busy,
you leave the number at home, or you’re out of town, then forget it —
you’re already to Thursday.
 Thursday. Too close to the weekend. It’s too late to ask someone out for
the weekend or to admit you don’t have a date. Besides, a second date
on a weekend rather than a weekday ups the ante too much.
 Now it’s Friday. Calling on Friday is the same as Thursday.
 Ditto Saturday.
 Sunday is still the weekend and a refocus on work, not play.
 No one makes any important calls on a Monday.
 Tuesday. Ahhh. That feels about right. Work is calm, your head is calm,
your heart is calm, and your conscience is still clean. Now pick up the
phone . . . ’cept it’s now been nearly two weeks. Yikes!
Guys: Win many more Brownie points by calling before ten days. Girls: Chill.
The problem is the pattern, not you.
220
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Believe in fate
Believing in fate helps you chill out a bit. It gives you perspective. If the rela-
tionship is meant to be, it’ll happen. If your parents hadn’t decided to have
another kid and your dad hadn’t been transferred to a new town and you
hadn’t skipped second grade, you two never would have met. If it is meant to
be, if the two of you are meant to be, relax — it’ll happen.
Nix the gossip
The temptation to blab about your great date will be intense, especially as the
clock ticks while you wait for the call (or wait to call). But be very careful here.
Bragging to your buddies about your date’s bod or huge libido or exaggerat-
ing her affection for you is totally uncool. What if the two of you end up
together? There’s no way to erase an image once it’s planted in someone’s
head, and your friends won’t treat her respectfully if you don’t.
221
Chapter 18: The Next Day
The farmer’s daughter
When a friend of mine was stationed overseas
in the army, he met the young daughter of a
French farmer. The generous farmer offered my
friend, Brian, a home-cooked meal, and he
accepted. That evening, and several evenings
after, he dined with the family and slowly
became smitten with the young girl. But she
was only 14, and only Elvis Presley was allowed
to indulge such fantasies.
Fast-forward 30 years. Brian was back home in
the States, divorced, and the father of two girls.
On a vacation to France, he decided to look up
the farmer who was, by now, an elderly man, but
he still remembered Brian and invited him over
for dinner.
“How’s your daughter?” Brian asked casually,
as they were sipping port in the family vineyard
after dinner.
“You can ask her yourself,” the farmer said.
“She’s dropping her son off later this evening.”
Which she did, and she nearly lost her breath
when she saw Brian standing in her father’s
doorway. She, too, was divorced and had never
forgotten her first crush. The years melted
away, and now as two adults, they fell in love.
This summer marks their 20th wedding anniver-
sary. “It was just meant to be,” Brian often says,
sighing.
So leave the phone alone. Get out of the house.
Get on with your life and be pleasantly — and
genuinely — surprised when he or she really
does call.

Sharing every intimacy is also uncool. Give your date a break. He’s entitled to
get to know you without all your friends getting to know him first. Keep your
expectations limited.
This is a fragile and vulnerable time for both of you and any potential future.
An audience ups the ante, the intensity, the curiosity — and you’re better off
without it. You’ll be glad you didn’t blab too much about your date before
your date began once you experience the emotionally charged post-date wait-
ing period. Who needs everyone and their mother asking you if he called yet
or if she left you any messages on your e-mail? All the way around, it’s best to
keep info close to the vest until your relationship really gets going. Even then,
discretion is the mother of true trust.

T
he first date jitters are out of the way, and it’s on to date number two.
Your emotions are still in a whirl but for entirely different reasons. No
longer are you worried about knocking the shoes off your date with a daz-
zling first impression. That’s done. You did it or you didn’t. Not to worry.
Even if you weren’t James Bond or Kim Basinger, you impressed your date
enough to secure a second shot. Now the stakes are higher. If your first date
was a rousing success, the next one better be fantastic. If date number one
was so-so, date number two better score higher on the dating scale.
Understandably, you’re going to feel a bit stressed as well as excited, hopeful,
flattered, challenged, optimistic, and even giddy. That’s okay. Everybody feels a
smorgasbord of emotions when the flicker of a potential love match has been
ignited. What you want to do is chill out, keep your expectations in check, and
make sure this budding relationship doesn’t burn out before it even begins.
Is It Really a Second Date?
The first thing I want you to do is make sure you’re dealing with a bona fide
second date. In Dr. Joy’s Perfect World of Dating, you met your date through
friends, asked him or her out to lunch, had fun, and arranged to meet again.
In the imperfect world we all live in, you may have met your date in class, at a
party, on the street. You said, “I’m going to Starbucks for a cappuccino.
Wanna come?” He went, bought his own cup of coffee, chatted with you, had

a few laughs, and gave you his phone number when you offered yours.
Technically, you had a date. But who deals in technicalities when dating is
concerned? In reality, you had more of a date-ette than a date.
Dates versus date-ettes
A date lasts at least three hours, is planned ahead of time, and takes place after
noon in ironed clothing. A date-ette is spontaneous, can last a few minutes or an
hour or two, takes place day or night, and doesn’t even require a shower.
This distinction is unimportant until we begin speaking about second dates,
because you have to know when the first date occurred. So first get clear in
your own head what your first date really was. If it was indeed a date, good
for you: Your second date is an authentic second date, and you’re right on
track. If your first get-together was really a date-ette, however, then the next
time you two go out, you’re really on official date number one — or maybe
one and a half. That’s okay. There are no hard and fast rules here. But you
may want to flip back to the chapters on first dates and take it from there if
you’ve only had a date-ette. This chapter is for solid second-daters, not
second-date wannabes.
First dates can be date-ettes, but second dates have to be dates. The progres-
sion flows naturally. If it doesn’t — if you keep spontaneously grabbing a bite
to eat or a cup of coffee — you’re not dating. You’re hanging out.
Anatomy of a true second date
A first date is takeoff — your seatback is in the upright position, your tray
table is stowed, you’ve buckled your seatbelt and are listening intently to
make sure that the engines are on full throttle. A second date is climbing to
cruising altitude. You’re on the way to your destination. You’re up in the air.
You hope the pilot didn’t have a martini with her lunch, the flight attendant
didn’t have a fight with his girlfriend, and the skies are not cloudy all day. In
other words, a second date is the beginning of a settling-in period.
Sometimes, a second date is wishing you were there already. Mostly, it’s
trying to sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight. Whereas your first date is about
fantasy — getting your hair done, being on your best behavior, and looking at
your date through rose-colored glasses — your second date is the beginning
of reality. You let your hair down a bit; you reveal the real — or realer — you;
and you see your date through a magnifying glass, if not reading glasses.
Table 19-1 continues the discussion about what a second date is and isn’t.

Obsessing about yourself
The beauty of a second date is that real personalities can begin to emerge.
Your date’s nervous laughter mellows into a great sense of humor; his or her
personal résumé becomes a story of a life. Of course, the potential downside
is that real personalities emerge. The date you thought was a friendly over-
tipper who dressed impeccably and arrived on time suddenly morphs into a
flirtatious spendthrift who is narcissistic and obsessive. Oops. The important
thing here is to take a second date for what it really is — namely, the next leg
on your journey toward getting to know someone better. Period.
225
Chapter 19: The Second Date
When distraction is your best option
I am not a happy flier. Intellectually, I understand
the aerodynamics of lift and speed and air pres-
sure and that flying is the safest, quickest, and
easiest way to travel. Emotionally, I’m not
thrilled to be strapped into that small space with
all those people. Once we’re up there, flying flat,
I feel more secure or at least more distracted —
the movie is on, the peanuts have arrived, the
club soda bubbles tickle my nose — until we hit
turbulence or are in a holding pattern.
But because I have to fly a lot for work, I figure I
have two options: I can make myself truly miser-
able and dig my fingernails into the armrests or
my fellow passenger on takeoff, or I can bring my
own distractions to keep me busy until the movie
and peanuts and seltzer bubbles take over. To
every airline’s major relief, I choose the latter. I
never fly without an engrossing paperback, a
crossword puzzle, or an unfinished book chapter
my editor is waiting for me to finish. I distract
myself before my mind can get carried away on
all the “what ifs.”
Should you find yourself on a second date fan-
tasizing about gene pools or doodling your first
name and his last name, stop immediately and
distract yourself. Though I wouldn’t recommend
whipping out a crossword puzzle, you might
want to try doing what you initially set out to do:
Get to know your date. Not your future marriage
partner or the potential mother of your kids or
even the guy you want to take home to meet
Mom. Just relax and realize there’s no substi-
tute for time, no excuse for shortcuts, and no
way to really know someone without listening,
learning, caring, sharing, and being there.

On a second date, there will be more . . .
 Communicating: You move from neutral conversational territory, like
census data, to more personal stuff like family history, favorite movies,
the school you went to, school you go to, hometown, work life — stuff
you’d put in a personal ad, stuff your next-door neighbor knows but not
the ultra sensitive stuff you tell only your best friend. It’s also a good
time for follow-up. You asked the opening questions on your first date;
now get a bit more detail.
 Testing the compatibility waters: You want to make sure you and your
date are a good fit. Your attention shifts away from how you look, act,
feel, talk, eat, and slurp to the kind of person your date is.
 Probing for shared interests: While you want to express yourself on a
first date, a second date is for allowing, encouraging, desiring, and listen-
ing to your date express what he or she likes and dislikes.
 Sexual innuendoes: Nothing overt, but playful flirting is good.
 Gazing into each other’s eyes: Most importantly, a second date is one
step further along on the intimacy scale. It’s about stripping away the
outer layer of superficiality and beginning to know your date’s soul.
Few things are more intimate, or soulful, than prolonged eye contact.
Don’t stare. But don’t be afraid to connect with the window to your
date’s soul — the eyes.
Good places for a second date
Given that a second date is about delving deeper, getting to know someone
better, flirting a bit more, and just plain being more intimate, pick a place that
lets you do those things:
 Quiet restaurant or café
 Public park
 Sporting event
 Museum
Following are some not-so-good places to do those things:
 Noisy bar
 Quiet bar
 Movie marathon
 Your parents’ house
 Your date’s parents’ house
 Your place
226
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

In Between One and Two
Everything that happens between the first date and the second has an effect
on date number two:
 If it was lust at first sight and you both have been whispering sweet
nothings over the phone all week, your second date will look much dif-
ferent than it would if your date took ten days to call you again. Bear
that in mind when you embark on date number two.
Your second date may seem either more intense or more subdued than
it actually is. There’s simply no substitution for time when it comes to
really knowing someone and understanding how he or she will (or
won’t) fit into your life. Don’t short-circuit the time you really need to
tap how you really feel.
 If more than two weeks have passed between date number one and date
number two, your second date is likely to feel more like a first date.
Adjust your expectations accordingly.
Date Expectations
One of the biggest differences between any first date and second date is
expectation. Be very careful here. You don’t want your expectations to be
sky-high any more than you want them to be so low you’re grateful for the
slightest crumb your date flicks across the table. I know it’s hard trying to
enter a date with a blank slate, but you really owe it to yourself and your date
to try to enter with your eyes, heart, and mind open.
Expectation is no simple matter. The dictionary defines expectation as look-
ing for what’s “due, proper, or necessary.” Interestingly, the word comes from
the same root as “spectacle,” the Latin spectare, meaning “to gaze at.” What
this all means is that you form your expectation of any event by instanta-
neously “gazing at” your past experiences, stuff that’s happened to your
friends or your parents or your family, what the media has convinced you is
proper, and what your peers have convinced you you’re due. So you walk into
any situation with at least some expectation as to how it would, could, or —
worse — should turn out.
Trouble is, your date doesn’t have your same history. Your date isn’t carrying
the same baggage. He has a whole different set of luggage. That’s when expec-
tations can get a bit dicey. You expect your date to think and feel as you do.
When it doesn’t happen as you anticipated, feelings get hurt and tempers
flare and the whole experience takes a kamikaze nosedive.
227
Chapter 19: The Second Date

Don’t fall into this trap. You can’t erase expectation completely — it’s okay to
expect to have a good time with someone you already like — but try to iden-
tify what your expectations are before your second date begins. That way,
you’ll recognize immediately when (or if) your expectations are dashed, and
you can put the whole thing in perspective. You may want to refer to Chapter
17 to understand your dating expectations.
Mind over what’s-the-matter
Getting all stressed-out is easy if your second date doesn’t measure up to the
notion you had of the way things should go or if you put so much pressure on
yourself that nothing you do or say is going to be good enough. Don’t go
there. You won’t have any fun. Your date won’t have any fun. Everybody
loses. Instead, if you start to feel tense, take a breather (literally) and do a
quick reality check. Ask yourself the following:
 What’s really bothering me here? Am I blaming my date for my expec-
tations? Am I bringing up past history? Have I jammed a couple of unre-
lated memories and fears together to make a stress sandwich? If so, pull
yourself back into the moment and deal with the here and now.
 Am I trying to make sure my date doesn’t get too close? Intimacy is a
scary thing, particularly in a second date where, presumably, you two
are revealing more about yourselves. If you find yourself mentally run-
ning for the dugout before the seventh-inning stretch, get back in the
game and see how it ends up.
 Is this just old news? If you notice that you seem to be falling back on
tired old patterns to make yourself feel comfortable, knock it off. Tell your-
self you’re safe, that it’s okay to feel a little afraid, and not to worry —
you’ll hold your hand every step of the way.
Old patterns, new people
Behavior patterns — acting in a characteristic way — begin to take hold on
the second date. If you tend to be a relationship sprinter rather than a long-
distance runner, you’ll continue to quickly fall in and out of love with each
new person unless you do something to change it. If you typically scare the
dickens out of your dates by confessing true love on the way to the car, you’ll
probably act it out again unless you do something to change the pattern. Or if
you’re so scared of intimacy that it takes you ten years to trust someone, you
probably won’t change unless you make a conscious effort to do so.
228
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

If you don’t already know your dating patterns (everybody has patterns of
behavior), I want you to pay attention on the second date so you can uncover
your tendencies and know what to watch for in yourself. If you’re already
aware of patterns and like what you see in yourself, don’t change a thing. But
if you’ve noticed a destructive dating style in the past and want to change it,
follow these steps:
1. Identify the behavior.
As soon as you experience one of those there-I-go-again moments, pre-
tend you’re a school kid at a crosswalk: Stop, look, and listen to yourself.
2. Define the behavior.
Mentally describe your behavior in a specific sentence like, “Whenever
I’m nervous, I tend to be sarcastic” or “As soon as it seems like someone
really likes me, I get turned off.”
3. Place it in the moment.
Try to pinpoint what set you off this time. Was it her arm brushing up
against yours? Was it something he said?
4. Put it on hold.
Patterns don’t change overnight. They especially don’t change smack in
the middle of a date. What you want to do, once you’ve nailed down a
behavior pattern, is to relax, file it away in your brain, and look at it later
on when you’re alone.
The First Fifteen Minutes
of a Second Date
Unlike the extensive pre-planning that goes into a first date, less is needed for
a second date. But there’s a lot more at stake, so a bit of forethought will help
you and your date relax. You want to solve any potential problems involving
the first 15 minutes of your second date before you get underway. The imme-
diate decisions to be made are these:
 Question: Do you kiss your date on the cheek when you first meet?
On the lips?
Answer: Cheek, okay. Lips, no way.
 Question: Do you take your date’s hand? Put your arm around his or
her shoulder?
Answer: No hand, no arm, no proprietary touching just yet. Handshakes
are okay if you opt for no kiss.
229
Chapter 19: The Second Date

 Question: Do you talk about your last date together? Or stick to the
present moment?
Answer: Continuing a previous conversation or asking about the status
of something you already talked about is great. It’s a real intimacy-
builder and lets your date know you were listening.
 Question: Do you go to someplace different from the first date?
Answer: Yes. Especially if date number one was a date-ette. The location
reflects a lot about you and how you feel about your companion. You
don’t have to spend a bundle, but if your goal is getting to know what
makes your date tick emotionally and spiritually, a loud concert may not
be the best way to go.
 Question: Does money matter?
Answer: Money always matters to some degree. But don’t let a lack of
the green stuff freak you out or keep you from asking someone out. A
walk in the park can be a better second date than dinner at the Ritz.
What’s most important is picking a place that lets you feel free to be you
and lets your date feel free to get to know you. Just don’t look cheap —
make sure you have enough to cover any expected expenses, plus $20
tucked in a secret compartment.
Getting to Know You
The info-exchange process on a second date is fun and exciting and interest-
ing and a bit tricky. Unlike a first date, which is pretty superficial, a second
date delves a little deeper. You already know you like each other enough to
find out more. How much more remains to be seen. For now, you want to be
vulnerable enough to let your date see who you really are without showing all
your warts at once. (A wart or two is okay.) You want your date to feel comfy
enough to share a wart or two with you.
To get the good stuff, you’ve got to give it. Trust me — your date won’t open
up if you just sit there with your arms crossed. Though a second date usually
shifts the conversational focus away from you and onto your date, striking a
balance between being a good listener and an interesting and sincere talker is
crucial — and not always easy or comfortable right away.
First, know your personality type before the second date even starts. Are you
the strong, silent type? A Chatty Cathy? Knowing who you are can help you
tone down your natural tendency to clam up or blab on and on.
230
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Second, periodically gauge how things are going. Here are some basic rules:
 If you feel you know everything about your date and your date knows
nothing about you, it’s time to open up.
 If your date has been nodding for the past hour, it’s time to hush up.
 If your time together seems more like a stand-up routine than a conver-
sation, take a deep breath and focus on getting more insight, less laughs.
 If your date sounds more like a job interview than a chat, it’s time to get
a bit more personal.
 If your date blushes each time you ask him or her a question, it’s time to
get less personal.
 If the conversation on your second date keeps grinding to a screeching
halt, ask yourself if it’s you or your date. One of you is uncomfortable. It’s
okay to flat-out say, “We had such fun the last time we went out. Is some-
thing making you uncomfortable?” If the answer is no and the conversa-
tion still limps along, you may be looking at a second, and final, date.
Trust or Consequences
Trusting someone instantaneously can be just as devastating as suspecting
an ulterior motive behind everything he or she says. True trust takes time.
No shortcuts allowed. Remember: Your date is just your date; he or she isn’t
your friend. Even if you’ve been chatting for months online, trust still takes a
lot of together time. If your date wants you to give more than you’re willing to
give at this early stage, don’t be afraid to say so . . . and stick to your guns.
If, on the other hand, you don’t want to “slip” and divulge any clues as to
where you live or work, what you do for a living, or what color your hair really
is, you may be a touch paranoid. Yeah, the world can be a dangerous place.
But if you trust someone enough to agree to a second date, it’s only fair to let
him or her get to know you. This isn’t a CIA investigation. It’s a date. Chill out.
Particularly if you’re over 30, avoid what I call the Blitz School of Dating.
That’s when you’ve been there, done that, and you don’t want to waste any
time. You want to book a table in a quiet restaurant where the waiter won’t
bother you for the two hours you take to chronologically pour out your life
story, hear your date’s, and determine if this union has legs. While the Blitz
approach has been known to work on occasion, I don’t recommend it. Part of
the mystery and magic of getting to know someone is getting to know some-
one, not hearing how well they know themselves.
231
Chapter 19: The Second Date

Finally, resist the temptation to ask yourself the $64,000 question: Is this the
one? Is this second date with the person with whom you’ll spend the rest of
your life? Have babies with? Rock on the porch with? Watch go gray? While
the urge may be there to weigh every second date on the “forever scale,”
don’t give in to it. Distract yourself. It’s too soon. A relationship hasn’t even
taken flight yet.
If your worst enemy knew what you’re telling your second date, could he or
she use it against you? If the answer is yes, keep it under wraps for now. If
not, go for it.
The Last Fifteen Minutes
of a Second Date
Two words: No sex.
Two more words: Too soon.
Even though you feel like you’ve known each other all your lives, it’s really
only been two nights, or an afternoon and an evening, or ten minutes and
lunch. You get the picture. You don’t know each other — don’t get to know
each other under the sheets.
Physical intimacy blurs the emotional intimacy of a relationship. It’s hard to
see things clearly when hormones are involved. A second date isn’t even a
relationship yet, so sex confuses the whole deal. Making out is okay. Making
out passionately is cool. Just don’t go any further than that until you know
each other better. Ask yourself if you’d be embarrassed the next day if the
previous night of lovemaking turned out to be a disaster. If the answer is
“well, yeah,” then the answer to sex has to be “well, no.”
Never have sex with anyone whose middle name you don’t know.

Chapter 20
Learning about Each Other
In This Chapter
 Knowing which things to tell and when
 Knowing which things to keep quiet
 Asking questions
I
once had a guy appear at my house for a first date with a bouquet of
daisies and a résumé. He thrust both at me and said, “Read this. I’ll be
back in 20 minutes to answer any questions.” I pointed out to him that I was
going on a date with him, not looking to hire him, and that anything I wanted
to know, I could ask. Although I prefer the I’ll-talk-to-you-and-you-talk-to-me
approach to getting to know someone, he seemed to prefer the here’s-my-
curriculum-vitae approach. So I ended up knowing a bunch of stuff that I
didn’t necessarily want to know, like his work history — and the fact that he
wanted to duck out on any messy, emotional stuff, which of course, like most
of us, is what I wanted to know. Talk about a guy who has a hard time talking
from the get-go. As you can imagine, things went downhill from there.
Not all dates begin with such a gap between what you want to know (or share)
and what the other person wants to tell you (or hear), but they do all begin
with the desire to share some information. After all, without an exchange of
something, the two of you remain strangers; if you weren’t interested in learn-
ing about each other, you wouldn’t be on a date in the first place. If that’s not
your motivation, if you’re just tired of your own company or want a free dinner
or a warm body, we need to talk! The job here is to figure out what to ask, what
to tell, and what to finesse. The list changes as the two of you get to know each
other, but the basic guidelines remain in place.
Volunteering Information
What information you share — and when — depends on who you are and
your level of comfort with openness and who your date is. If your date is
open and friendly and accepting, you most likely feel comfortable sharing
more. If you’re dating someone reserved, you’re likely a bit less forthcoming.
This is called mirroring (see Chapter 12) and survival and common sense.

Some people are quite comfortable sharing some parts of their lives and less
comfortable sharing other parts. What you’re trying to accomplish early on
is compatibility — a good fit. So volunteer what you’re comfortable having
most people know about you. The rest you can slowly divulge as the relation-
ship progresses; in other words, you don’t have to produce an autobiogra-
phy, complete with a slew of your opinions — or your most awful secret or
family scandal — all in the first couple of dates.
Most people who date have a mini-scenario worked out in their heads of what
they want someone to know about them. You, too, can create a mini-script —
what you’d tell someone on a long airplane trip, for example, or someone at a
party is a place to start:
 Include a little bit about your factual life: You know — things like
where you’re from, where you went to school, how many brothers and
sisters you have, what hobbies you like, what kind of work you do, and
how you spend your free time. In other words, this script can more or
less include the stuff you’d put in a personal ad if you had unlimited
space and money. (In a way, the early days of dating are a personal 
ad — you share who you are and what you want — with the advantage
being that your date gets to respond immediately, without writing to a
post office box.) Age and weight are optional.
 Share feelings: Worries, music groups that you like, whether you’re a
baseball, opera, or chocolate fan, and how the weather is affecting you.
 Keep the script positive and realistic: Your comments shouldn’t be too
negative or make you sound like the best thing since sliced bread. Self-
effacement works only for Woody Allen, and a braggart isn’t much fun to
be around.
When you share information, keep the following in mind:
 As the two of you get to know each other, remember that you really
don’t know each other. If the date doesn’t turn out well, this person is
going to have all the information you’re now blabbing.
 Make sure that you’re not using information as a way to bind some-
one to you too soon and too tightly. This tactic usually doesn’t work
anyway, and you’ll hate yourself in the morning for telling someone you
don’t plan to see again that your family’s completely dysfunctional and
you’ve been in therapy since third grade.
 Exchanging information is like dancing — you have to move together,
or it doesn’t work very well at all. Some people are comfortable volun-
teering some things; others are comfortable volunteering other informa-
tion. Just because you describe the house you grew up in doesn’t mean
that your date has to blueprint his family homestead. The key is to make
sure that you’re not doing all the talking or all the listening.
234
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Once the two of you really get to know each other and have moved from first
date to first month to first year, the ratio of what you don’t talk about to what
you do does — and should — shift dramatically. After all, you don’t want to
not tell anything that, after being found out, will shake the pillars of your rela-
tionship. But too much too soon is without a context for understanding.
The following sections give you guidelines on what type of information is
important to tell and when you should share this information.
Things to tell immediately
If there’s something about you that you think can affect any long-term
prospects and that more than two people know, you may as well ’fess up on
the first few dates — especially if you feel that it may blow things. You can try
to create an environment that makes sense, but keeping that big of a secret
from the get-go adds pressure and nervousness at a pressurized time. If you’d
tell a same-sex potential friend, tell your date. If your date is cool about it,
you’re relaxed. If not, at least you haven’t invested much already.
Information that more than two people have isn’t a secret. If your date is
likely to find out sooner to later, you may as well tell sooner rather than jeop-
ardize the relationship once it progresses and the additional factor of trust is
introduced (as in, “If you’d lie about this, what else haven’t you told me?”).
Any long-term relationship is based on trust. If you can’t trust someone, you
can’t love that someone, so don’t start off hiding important facts.
The list of things you definitely must share includes most of the biggies in
life. You should share this information by the third or fourth date. Any earlier
is unnecessarily brutal; after all, if you really don’t fancy one another, why
parade the skeletons from your closet? Any later is viewed as a breach of
trust (plus, not having shared can get you in more trouble than any upset
that telling may now create).
 Previous marriages: How many times you’ve been married, how long
you were married, and how long you’ve been apart. But don’t go into too
much detail. See the later section “Keeping Mum.”
Notice that you should confess previous marriages, not whether you’re
married or separated or in the process of divorce. The reason? If you are
married or separated or in the process of a divorce, you have no busi-
ness dating at all — not until one full year after the divorce is final. I’m
not kidding here. If you fit into one of these three categories, you can
hang out with friends, work out, paint your house, become a temporary
workaholic, take courses, volunteer — but you can’t date. If you want to
find out why, hop to Chapter 5 or Chapter 30.
235
Chapter 20: Learning about Each Other

 Previous convictions and parole violations: What crime you were con-
victed of and how long you were in prison. (I’m sorta kidding here, but
stuff happens.)
 Previous bankruptcies: How long ago you filed for bankruptcy and why.
 Previous kids: How many, how old, whether they live with you, and if
they don’t, how often you see them.
 Previous sex change operations: What can I say?
When should you share this information? You don’t necessarily have to share
it when you first lay eyes on one another, but before the end of the third date
at latest. Confessions of any kind — even “I think you’re swell” — need to be
seen and heard in context. The best rule for when to tell is when you’d want
to know if you were the one about to hear what you have to say.
Things to tell eventually
Sooner or later, the I’ll-do-anything-you-like-to-do phase has to stop; not only is
it boring, but it’s also not entirely honest. After all, you must have some likes
and dislikes. They’re what make you the person you are, and jettisoning them
all in the interest of harmony is a short-sighted perspective. At this point (I’m
talking date three or four, max), you want to be honest about who you are and
what you enjoy doing. This information is not first tier — it doesn’t need to be
understood as the bedrock facts of the relationship on date one — but it is
important enough to be risked even if the result is mild turbulence; otherwise,
you run the risk of being trapped by your pretenses.
If you can’t keep up the ruse forever (and you can’t), it’s best not to keep it
up at all. But realistically, at the beginning of a dating experience, we all res-
onate a bit; we want to be liked and likable and agreeable, and so we soften
our own preferences because we want the relationship to endure. But sooner
or later, the real you has to come out, and the sooner the better. After all, you
want as few unpleasant surprises as possible.
Almost everyone has strong feelings about something. See if I push any of
your love or loathe buttons with the following:
 Aerobics
 Football
 Ballet
 Bullfighting
 Boxing
 Sky diving
236
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

 Types of food (Chinese, Mexican, French, and so on)
 White-water rafting
 Your date’s
• Perfume or aftershave
• Temper
• Drinking
• Sense of humor
• Socks
Note: As you get seemingly closer to the loath side of the list, it becomes
even more important to temper your firm opinions with gentleness.
As you share your likes and dislikes in the name of honesty, be gentle. Telling
someone you’re not crazy about football may be jarring to a die-hard fan, but
you need to be especially careful about mouthing off about your date’s
 Best friend
 Parents
 Dog
 Hair color
 Haircut
 Height
 Weight
 Religion
Things to tell before sex
I can’t say this often or strongly enough: You must have a frank and honest dis-
cussion with your clothes on and no alcohol or other mood-altering substances
coursing through your bloodstream before you hit the sheets. If you’re not sure
what this frank and honest discussion should include, take a look at the fol-
lowing list and keep in mind that if you’re not ready to talk about these
things, you’re not ready for sex:
 Condoms: Who’s supplying them? Don’t even think about not using one,
even if you use something else for a contraceptive. Nowadays, a condom
is as much a safety issue as it is a contraceptive issue.
 Contraception: What type and who’s providing it?
237
Chapter 20: Learning about Each Other

 Medical sexual history: Be sure to mention AIDS test results, herpes,
and any other sexually transmitted disease that you currently have or
are being treated for.
Unless you’re on medication whose primary side effect is impotence (for
example, blood pressure medicine and some anti-depressants), the fact
that you’ve occasionally had problems with impotence need not be dis-
cussed here unless the problem has been going on for quite some time.
If so, get professional medical treatment; otherwise, keep in mind that
impotence happens to all guys sooner or later. If you explain to your
partner that you really want to impress her and that’s a lot of pressure
for the little guy (okay, big guy), you can turn what seems to be a prob-
lem into a compliment.
 History of sexual abuse, if you think it’s relevant: For example, if you
can’t tolerate certain positions or words, say so. Also, you need to work
these issues out in therapy with a professional — not on a date.
 Past relationships: This is not a time to get into long, drawn-out discus-
sions of the misery of your past relationships (see the later section
“Keeping Mum”), but if these relationships are going to affect how you
behave with one another, you may as well get it out in the open now. The
it’s-not-you-it’s-me-dear defense is much more credible if you’ve brought
up the subject before the problem occurs.
 Fears: Claustrophobia and fear of pillows, dogs, heights, oral sex, pink
lights.
 Excitement: What turns you on.
 Positions and fantasies: Eventually, it really is okay to talk about
favorite positions and fantasies, but see if you can lay some groundwork
of trust before you go technical on one another.
 That you’re just not ready yet to be sexual either in the relationship
or at the moment: Just because you’ve been sexual together before
doesn’t mean either of you can’t say no now.
 That you want to wait till you’re married, engaged, or surer: See
Chapter 21 to find out how to say no gracefully.
Given this list of topics, you can understand why putting off having sex until
a relationship can really take hold makes sense. Knowing and trusting and
liking one another makes these issues loom a lot less large.
Things to tell if asked or pushed
The preceding sections outline the type of information you should share at
some point in the relationship. But what about the information that you’re not
obligated to share but have been asked for? You know the type of questions:
238
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

the ones — like “How many relationships have you been in?” — that come out
when you least expect it and leave you sputtering in your dessert. Do you
avoid answering? Subtly change the subject? Look at your date like it’s none of
his or her business (which it isn’t, really)? Or just ’fess up? Although historical
accuracy isn’t required in answering a question like this — in other words,
you can avoid giving too much detail (think of Andie MacDowell’s character in
Four Weddings and a Funeral) — if you stonewall completely, you’re likely to
make your date think you have something to hide. So the best answer is to
give a brief history — more or less what you’d put on an entry in who’s who in
American dating circles — and then move on without editorial comment that
includes who, how long, how many, or preferred positions.
Some questions are so hard to answer that you really should feel compelled
to answer only if you’re pushed — that is, if your date won’t let the subject
drop and not answering is likely to hurt the relationship more than a tactful
but honest answer would. Some questions that fall into this category are
 Why didn’t you have an orgasm?
 What is wrong with me?
 Why don’t you like my friend?
Sharing Feelings
Setting guidelines on when to share feelings is a bit trickier. Admittedly, the
coin of the realm for dating is feelings and intimacy, but in the early stages of
dating, everything is a bit fragile. What you’re trying to do at this point is to
set a firm foundation for everything to follow — but what this everything
entails is almost impossible to predict.
A new dating situation is an investment between the two of you. You need to
establish the ground rules together and get a feel for who both of you are and
what you want all the while watching the interest mount, getting a return on
your investment, and trusting the stability and reliability of the institution
(that is, the idea that neither of you is going to rip the other off). Building this
kind of trust takes a bit of time. Just as if you were to borrow money from a
bank and be late on your first payment, the bank very well may see you as a
bad credit risk and recall the loan. But if you’ve had the loan for years and
have never been late or missed a payment, being late or missing a payment in
year three will feel very different to both you and the bank.
When you share feelings, follow these basic rules:
 Be a tad cautious. Over exuberance (for example, taking a pledge of
undying love) can feel pretty scary if it’s in the first 15 minutes of a date.
No, you don’t have to be Gary Cooper, strong and silent, or Mata Hari,
239
Chapter 20: Learning about Each Other

the keeper of mysterious secrets, but blurting out unformed and unex-
amined feelings à la Pee-wee Herman can scare the daylights out of both
of you.
 Live with a feeling a bit before you express it. Make sure that what
you’re saying is true for more than the moment. If you’ve just tripped
over your date’s tennis shoe and you’re feeling angry, saying “I hate you,
you slob” probably reflects emotions stronger than you’ll be feeling in
ten minutes. If the sentiment isn’t going to be true for more than ten 
minutes, stifle it.
 Get some perspective on your own emotions and some control over
your mouth before you speak. Otherwise, you can mislead yourself and
your date. Saying “I love you” when you mean “Thank you” or “I’d like to
have sex,” for example, isn’t fair or kosher, and it misleads both of you.
As the two of you get to know each other better and feel safer and more
comfortable with one another and develop some history, your words
will have a context and can be evaluated that way. You’ll have a track
record together and will have enough experience to know what is char-
acteristic and what isn’t.
 In deciding what feelings to share and when, think about what would
be reasonable to expect at any given time. A promise of undying love
and devotion on the first date might feel kinda cool until you think it
through. All of us long to be loved and appreciated, but on the first date?
Nice — sorta — but completely unbelievable except in movies or
romance novels or from folks who are a bit unbalanced, really needy, or
really manipulative. So although “I really had a great time with you and
I’d like to do it again. How about you?” isn’t quite as flamboyant as “Will
you marry me? I knew from the first moment (five minutes ago) that you
were the one,” it is a lot more believable. If you want to tell your grand-
children “We knew from the very first moment” 50 years from now, okay,
but when in doubt, go slowly.
Guys’ proposing marriage on the first date is sorta cute and makes a girl
feel really special. It also offsets the notion that all men are commitment-
phobes who love ’em and leave ’em. But it is pure fantasy at best and
blatant manipulation at worst. Dating should be fun, not a mind game or
delusion.
So do share your feelings, but beware of temper and elation. Make sure they’re
feelings you’ve been feeling for more than one second and can live with in an
hour or two or a day or two. If you really must say it, finesse a bit — for exam-
ple, “I know it’s too soon to be feeling this, but it sure feels good to me right
now” — and then laugh sweetly. Trust is a fragile thing. You need to trust not
only each other, but yourself.

None of us are completely honest. If you told everything, you wouldn’t have
time to do anything but confess, and your conversations would be riddled
with lines like “Who in God’s name told you that puce is your color?” or “The
bunion on my toe is driving me insane” when you’re asked “How are you?” On
the other hand (and other than the kindly social prevarication), lying isn’t an
acceptable alternative either. The solution? Keep quiet.
People do things for reasons. Before you confess something, write it down on
a piece of paper, even if you have to make a quick trip to the bathroom to see
whether it makes any sense. Also evaluate why you’re about to spill these
particular beans. Are you looking for absolution? Trying to put the worst

Chapter 20: Learning about Each Other
When to say “I love you” (and when to keep quiet)
Few things are more memorable than the mag-
ical, angst-ridden, fingers-crossed, breath-held,
passion-filled moment when either you or your
date says, “I love you.” The phrase is much
more than three little words. It’s also a silent
question. As in, “Do you love me, too?” Properly
managing this moment can spell the difference
between euphoria and humiliation. Tips:
 Wait at least several months, a minimum of
three but preferably longer, before confess-
ing your true love — even if you feel it on
the first night. It takes a while to gain and
build trust. Zooming ahead too fast can
easily backfire, and it’s really embarrassing
to find out you changed your mind and you
don’t really love ’em.
 If your date says, “I love you” and you don’t
love your date back, don’t say “Love you,
too” just to be nice. You’ll open a can of
worms that’ll only make a gigantic mess.
 If you’ve been together a while and you’re
just waiting for your date to spill the beans
first, take a chance and tell him or her how
you feel. Your date may be waiting for you
to take the plunge.
 Realize that “love” doesn’t always mean the
same thing to everyone. For some, the word
“love” is followed by the word “marriage.”
For others, “love” is always followed by
“ya.” Make sure you’re clear on how you
feel before putting your feelings into words,
and give a thought to the way your date
might receive what you’re about to say.
 Understand that true love implies commit-
ment. If you’re not ready to be monoga-
mous, connected, open, and loving, don’t
say “I love you” just yet.
 If the only time you’re tempted to confess
love is during sex or when you’re apart,
close your mouth, open your eyes, and see
what’s really going on.

foot forward? Trying to get the person to go away because you’re not really
interested? Setting up a test to make your date prove intentions (don’t even
think about it — manipulation isn’t a pretty sight)? Ask yourself why you
want this person to know what you’re about to tell. If the only reason you
can come up with is “I’m just being honest,” look harder or keep your mouth
firmly closed.
Following is a list of topics you should keep to yourself unless you have a
compelling reason to do otherwise:
 Details of past loves
 If you’ve cheated
 Sexual stories
 Your own inexperience
 Your own incredible experience
 Your bank account
 Your poverty
 Gossip
 Your innate superiority or inferiority
 Your friends’ feelings about your date
 Previous hospitalizations (until month four, at least)
 Your parents’ bigotry
 Your bigotry
Past sexual experiences
When in doubt, keep your mouth shut. If there was ever an area about which
to draw a blank, it has to do with past sexual experiences. Over, done with,
irrelevant. Don’t ask; don’t tell, even if tempted. You’ll both regret any depar-
ture from this policy.
All of us want to be loved not in spite of our warts but because of them. You
want to feel that someone knows and loves the real you, but confessing
sexual issues feels good for you for the moment but bad for the person who
has to listen, and it will come back and haunt you both.
242
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

See any pattern in the following list? You should. All these topics relate to
past sexual experiences to keep a lid on:
 Previous love affairs
 Previous one-night stands
 Previous indiscretions
 Flings with the boss
 Flings with your best friend’s significant other
 Sexual preferences
 Ménage à trois or more
If you have fantasies of being with someone else, remember that you’re not
the only person who has occasionally thought about an old love or a movie
star when you’re with your current date. The question is not “Is it okay?” but
“How often does it occur, and how necessary does it feel?” If this type of fan-
tasy happens most of the time, you’re not ready to be with this person. If it
happens only occasionally and, in general, you’re pleased with your date,
keep your mouth shut and enjoy the once-in-a-while forbidden pleasure of let-
ting your mind wander.
You’re an adult, and human beings aren’t perfect. Learn from your mistakes
and move on. Like everybody else, you’re a compendium of everything that’s
come before: the people you’ve known (teachers, parents, sibs, the kinder-
garten bully, Sunday school teachers), the things you’ve done (your first kiss,
dance lessons, strike-outs), and the things you’ve experienced (getting bad
haircuts, developing crushes, receiving a favorite Valentine, getting a bloody
nose, adoring favorite rock stars, losing report cards), and so on. Your sexual
history is part of you, but the more you talk about it, the larger it’s likely to
loom. And a looming sexual history does nothing but taint your current
dating situation. If you need to confess about past sexual experiences, find a
priest or a therapist, but with everyone else, adopt the Clinton plan: Don’t
ask, don’t tell. You’ll both be happier and wiser.
243
Chapter 20: Learning about Each Other
The perils of being a good listener
Admittedly, the fact that I’m a psychologist and
a really good listener means that dates tell me
more than I really need to know. On first dates,
I’ve been told about autistic offspring, severed
and reattached limbs, spy networks, and psy-
chiatric history. I probably would have found out
about all these things eventually, but early dates
seem to me to be a gentle unfolding of the rose-
bud that is all of our lives, not a confessional
dumping ground that says, “Now that you know
the worst, any interest in continuing?” It’s an
interesting technique but a little hard on the
stomach lining.

Past relationships
In general, talking about past relationships is a really bad idea. They’re over
and done with. When you talk about them, the tendency is to paint either
your ex or yourself as a bad person. If you paint yourself as bad, you may
plant the question in your date’s mind, “Why waste time with this loser?” If
you paint your ex as bad, you can end up looking paranoid and unintention-
ally bringing up the uncomfortable question “How would this dude talk about
me behind my back?” Talking about exes is just too much negativity.
If you can’t find something better to talk about than your exes, you need a
therapist, not a date.
Showing Interest
The earlier sections deal with information you must or must not share. But
presumably, at some point, you’re going to be curious. What questions are
okay to ask? Which ones need to be avoided?
Good questions to ask
It’s important not only to be interested but to seem interested in your date by
asking cool questions like the following:
 What do you do?
 What sports do you like?
 What’s your favorite free-time activity?
 What movies have you seen?
 What restaurants do you like?
 Do you think the president’s doing a good job?
Avoid questions like the following:
 Do you come here often? Trite, silly, and demeaning leading nowhere.
 How’s your food? The most common response is “Fine.” Complaining is
tacky, and what are you going to do about it? If you want to focus on
the food (I wouldn’t suggest it), you can offer to share. You can find
out gobs about your date very quickly by his or her willingness — or
unwillingness — to share.
 Can you believe the weather? Pleeeze try harder than this. It’s a dead-
end question that runs the risk of making you sound desperate.
244
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Good questions are those that draw your date out without putting him or
her on the spot. The goal here is to learn about one another, not scare the
daylights out of your date with your investigative prowess. You’re trying to
show interest, not terrorize. Talk, explain, find out what makes your date tick
a bit. It’s fun, so lighten up and follow these easy guidelines:
 Be prepared to talk about a lot of things. You can see why keeping up
with current events, the latest movie, a local political scandal, or (in a
pinch) your horoscope is a cool idea. If all you can talk about is work or
your exes, it’s going to be hard to begin building those conversational
bridges that give you the feeling that you’re getting to know someone
and letting him or her get to know you.
 Don’t worry about your next question. Listen to your date’s response.
It’s even okay to be quiet for a minute or two.
 Don’t fall into the Spanish Inquisition phenomenon. See the next sec-
tion for all the gory details.
The Spanish Inquisition phenomenon
The Spanish Inquisition was established by the Catholic Church to root out
heretics in 1480. The inquisitors’ methods were brutal, employing, among
other horrible torture devices, the rack, thumb screws, and boiling oil. You
do not want your date to be reminded of this historical era as you tastefully
peel away the protective layers and find out who this person is.
Any question can feel like an intrusion, so make yourself and your date 
comfortable:
 Share some things about yourself without dominating the conversa-
tion or showing off. The best way to elicit information is to offer some.
I’ll show you me if you’ll show me you.
 Ask thoughtful, nonaggressive questions. Doing so shows that you are
genuinely interested and paying attention.
 Avoid the enough-about-me-what-do-you-think-about-me? approach.
Remember, the trick is seeming interested enough to ask gentle questions
that show interest rather than reportorial zeal.
Avoiding Pitfalls
“Tell me a little about yourself” can always be countered by “What would you
like to know?” which can be sidestepped by “Whatever you’d like to tell me.”
245
Chapter 20: Learning about Each Other

Don’t be tempted to lie, even for effect. If you don’t plan to see this person
again, stay on neutral subjects, talk about the weather, or — okay, okay — go
to the movie where, at least, you won’t have to talk.
Another pitfall to avoid is the tendency, when you hear a problem, to move in
to fix it, becoming parent, therapist, or confessor. It’s awfully early to become
a fixer.
If you do plan to see each other again, don’t worry that everything has to be
said now or forever hold your peace. You have time, so relax and be as much
yourself as you can. Pretend that you’re talking to a friend who doesn’t know
you very well but likes you and isn’t going anyplace.

T
he time span between the end of date number two and the beginning of
the rest of your love life is a sort of “like/lust/love” limbo. It’s all about
potential. You’re in the what’s-going-to-happen-next? mode. It’s not a relation-
ship yet. It’s not a full-fledged friendship, either. It’s an exciting, sexy, mysteri-
ous, scary, thrilling sort of thing — which is just what this stage is supposed
to be. It’s a time to take it slowly, take stock, keep it all in perspective, and
accept your topsy-turvy emotions for what they really are: a natural reaction
to what potentially, plausibly, conceivably, hopefully, fingers-crossed, if
everything works out, may one day (possibly) be.
This is an especially important time to stay in the moment. Enjoy and don’t
get too far ahead of yourself. Take time to smell the roses, the coffee, the per-
fume, the cigars, and the wind. Slowing down: That’s the focus of this chapter.
Women are particularly prone to begin planning the color of the bridesmaids’
dresses, practicing writing his name as theirs, getting into the prince-on-a-
white-stallion mode. It’s too early to think about riding off into the sunset.
Chill, girl!
Just as you’re getting comfortable, understand your date may begin planning
ahead. Playing dumb and/or oblivious will cost you more than it’s worth in
the long run.

Scoping Out the Four Stages
of Attachment: The Gospel 
According to Dr. Joy
Although each dating situation is unique, each progresses in a fairly pre-
dictable way. This progression from first date to budding relationship is what
I call the four stages of attachment:
 Stage One: Ignition (from first date to first month): Your interest is just
starting up. Hopefully, there’s enough fuel on both sides to ignite a
spark. You’re on your best behavior, wear your best clothes, shine your
shoes, wear clean socks, pluck your eyebrows, thin your sideburns, and
stash breath mints in your pocket.
 Stage Two: First Gear (from 1 month to 3 months): If all’s well, you
didn’t pop the clutch and kill the engine or flood the carburetor. You’re
getting to know each other and checking the rearview mirror a bit, but
mostly you’re keeping your eyes on the road ahead, trying really hard to
mesh those gears without going too fast. You’re relaxed enough to be
real, to fumble with the check, to wear a shirt straight from the dryer
without ironing it, perhaps even to wear something comfy rather than
spiffy. You offer your date a breath mint, too, instead of just sneaking
one for yourself.
 Stage Three: Acceleration (from 3 months to 6 months): Foot on the gas
pedal, you’re raring to go. Physical and emotional attraction are steaming
up the windshield. You like each other a lot. You feel so comfy you invite
your date over to your place even when you haven’t picked the news-
paper off the floor. You order extra garlic on the pizza. You feel a sense
of give and take. Some of the nervousness about whether you’re on the
same page, map, or galaxy or in the same car has lessened a bit — okay,
mostly a lot.
 Stage Four: Cruise Control (from 6 months to 9 months): Sit back,
relax; you’re on the freeway. It’s a bona fide relationship-to-be. You love
each other, though you may not have said it yet. You’ve seen each
other’s flaws and find them adorable. You ate cold garlic pizza for break-
fast, and your mate asked you to, please, brush your teeth. Happily, you
complied. Not only are you in the car together, you can take turns dri-
ving (right . . . ), choose destinations together, and really enjoy the trip.
Applying the Brakes
Remember when you were a kid, and your parents were driving the whole
family to Disneyland or Magic Mountain or Lion Country Safari? As soon as
248
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

you saw the signs on the highway telling you there were only a few miles left
to go, you hopped up and down on your seat and squealed, “Faster! Faster!”
You couldn’t wait to get there. Remember what your parents said in
response? “Calm down. It’ll still be there when we get there.”
The same holds true for this thing you’re on the verge of experiencing. Calm
down. It’ll still be there when you get there. You’re still in the ignition stage.
As you read through this chapter, I want you to envision a flashing yellow
light. Proceed cautiously. Don’t come to a complete stop, but slow down and
look both ways. Enjoy the scenery. I know it’s hard chilling out when you
can’t wait to arrive. (I have a daughter. We’ve been to Disney World.) But
there are lots of really good reasons why it’s a good idea to take a deep
breath and gently apply the brakes, or at least be a little less lead-footed with
the gas.
In previous chapters, I talk about the chemistry of love. What you’re dealing
with in this early stage of dating is the chemistry of lust, which can be much
more compelling and much more confusing. When your dates go well, your
brain becomes flooded with natural amphetamines, or uppers, that make you
feel — literally — high on life. You’re full of happiness, energy, optimism. If
you were on an old Mary Tyler Moore Show episode, you’d toss your hat up in
the air. It feels like this excitement will last forever, which is lust’s practical
joke on us all. It doesn’t last. Eventually, the chemicals fade, and if deeper
feelings haven’t developed, your fledgling “relationship” fades as well.
When you race into a relationship instead of meandering along the scenic
route, not only do you miss out on all the good stuff you’d never see other-
wise, but you also set yourself up to drive straight off a cliff if things don’t
work out. It’s hard to see all those Dead End or Detour or Slippery When Wet
signs when you’re speeding, so the ultimate crash and burn takes you com-
pletely by surprise.
249
Chapter 21: Speed Bumps on Life’s Highway
Love at first sight
Phil Donahue once asked me about love at first
sight in the presence of three couples who had
fallen madly, passionately in love with one
another upon the initial locking of eyes. Not
wishing to rain on their parades and be seen as
the Wicked Witch of the West, I declared love at
first sight to be “lust with potential” — nothing
wrong with it unless you confuse it with any-
thing else like love, like, knowledge, reality, or
reason. (FYI: Within a year, a follow-up of the
program reported that all three couples were
either separated or divorced.)
On the other hand, 32 percent of couples mar-
ried more than 25 years report that they felt love
at first sight, which may be attributable to
impaired memory, luck, or willingness to do the
work of getting to know someone. Love at first
sight isn’t bad if you remember what it really is:
Lust with potential, not a reuniting of soul mates.

Moving slowly is as much about self-preservation as it is about laying a
proper foundation. Like I emphasized in Chapter 20, trust takes time. As in
months. As in lots of face-to-face, nose-to-nose (not lip-to-lip or hip-to-hip)
communication. Put in enough trust time and ask yourself some major soul-
searching questions:
 Focus: Why do I really want this person in my life? Is it about liking him
or her or how good it feels to have this person like me?
 Motive: Is this a romance or a rescue mission? Do I need or want this
person?
 Rationale: Do I think I’ll lose him or her if I don’t give all I’ve got right
away?
 Function: Is this more about getting into bed rather than getting to know
someone?
Be honest. It’s important to know what’s truly lurking in your head and your
heart. Misleading a date is uncool. Misleading yourself is unwise.
Putting Off Sex
Chapter 22 explains everything you ever needed or wanted to know about
sex and dating in this modern, complicated, out-there, in-your-face, Baywatch,
boob tube, wonderful, memorable, virtual day and age. For now, I want you to
understand the emotional reasons why waiting is a good idea. Not forever.
Just until you know each other pretty well.
Sex changes everything. Trust me on this — it just does — which is reason-
able, if you think about it. Sex is, after all, how human beings are created. If
sex meant nothing, what would that say about all of us? Still, no matter what
you believe about premarital, post-marital, extramarital, or even marital sex,
there is always an emotional metamorphosis after two people make love.
250
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 
Five ways to say no gracefully
 It’s too soon. I’d rather wait.
 I’m not that kind of guy/girl.
 I have a ten-date rule. If you want to know
what it is, ask me out again . . . and again.
 I’ll know when the timing’s right. It’s not
right, right now.
 I’d rather have something to look forward to
than back on.

Always. The relationship is never the same again. It can be better or worse,
but it’s never the same. Just look at the vocabulary. For instance, here are
some synonyms for the word naked:
 Bare
 Defenseless
 Exposed
 Helpless
 Raw
 Revealed
 Stripped
 Unprotected
 Vulnerable
Now, take a look at some synonyms for the word dressed:
 Adorned
 Bedecked
 Covered
 Decorated
 Embellished
 Guised
 Spruced up
The point is, sex is ultimately about exposure: physical, mental, spiritual, and
emotional exposure. There’s no more covering up. You’re letting it all hang
out, exposing a very intimate part of yourself to another human being, not to
mention the potential health exposure as well. All of this is why sex at this
point is so dicey. If you’re not ready to be that vulnerable, you’re all the more
vulnerable to getting hurt the next day or a bit farther down the road.
Baring your soul
The early stages of relationships — getting to know one another, tingling in
each others presence, daring to think this might be the one while steadfastly
trying to stay in the moment — should be savored and enjoyed, not rushed.
This is the time when you want to start baring your soul, not your body. It’s a
time to tiptoe into vulnerability, not leap into bed. The potential emotional
251
Chapter 21: Speed Bumps on Life’s Highway

cost is simply too high. Why risk it? Your mom was right. If he or she is worth
waiting for, he or she will wait. For now, I want you to relax and focus on let-
ting your date begin to see who you are inside. Most people wish they’d
waited just a bit longer to get sexual — not because of the sex but because
sex moves you at the speed of light past things you ought not to be moving
past at all. Don’t ever go to bed with someone if you have the slightest notion
that it’s too soon, that you’re feeling pressured, that you don’t really know
each other well enough, that you’d be devastated if they didn’t call or you’d
feel used – please wait.
Trusting your emotions
I once met an artist who sculpted these incredible horses out of marble.
Some were ebony, some a sort of salmon color. Others were a pearly white.
Each one, horse after horse, had a distinct look, a personality that literally
leapt off the pedestal where he’d mounted them. It was stunning. I asked him
how he did it.
“Did what?” he asked back.
“How do you create such unique beauties?”
He grinned and told me it was simple, really. “I don’t create anything,” he
said. “I just free the horses.”

Will the real Barbie please stand up?
The entire American culture conspires against
our getting real with who we are. Look at the
images all around us. On TV. In the movies.
Mannequins at the mall. If Hollywood were an
accurate reflection of who we are, most women
would look like giant Barbie dolls, and most men
would have full, lush heads of hair and wash-
board abs. Everyone would sit around at work
in $1,000 suits tossing barbs at one another, and
kids would solve all their problems in 22 minutes
or less.
The media’s portrayal of even the dark side of life
is distorted. Ask people if our country is more vio-
lent than ever, and most will say yes. The fact is,
that’s not true. According to the FBI, violent crime
has consistently decreased every year since
1993 and shows no indication of leaping up any
time in the near future. Yet the number of murder
stories broadcast on the network news rose 721
percent from 1993 to 1996, according to a study
done by the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
Get the picture? What we may think is real, right,
just, or the way everyone else is simply isn’t true.

When he began chipping away at a block of marble, he explained, he focused
on getting out of the horse’s way. “It’s all in there,” he said. “You just have to
figure out how to open the stone and let the horses out.”
At this early stage of dating (I’m talking about the first several weeks or
months), I want you to forget about sex for now and “free your horses.” Be
yourself. Let your date see the real you. Get out of your own way and reveal
your unique beauty. Instead of making love, make another date to do some-
thing that will bring you closer emotionally, such as:
 Taking a walk along the beach
 Going bird-watching in the woods
 Taking a drive
 Strolling the mall
 Having a picnic
 Sipping high tea together
 Snuggling up in front of the fire
 Baby-sitting
 Baking
 Visiting a museum
 Helping deliver food to shut-ins
 Visiting a nursing home or hospital
 Gardening
Not Getting Ahead of Yourself
Nailing your heart, head, and toes to the present moment is what you want to
do here. The temptation is strong — to fantasize about your glorious future;
to dump your desires onto your date, to project that your date feels the same
way about you; or to imagine that this is the person who will solve your past
relationship problems. Resist it. Bite the inside of your lip, if necessary, to
remind yourself, “Hey, I’m dealing with one person now, one moment in time,
one original situation.” It’s hard to do, I know, but you owe it to yourself and
your date.
253
Chapter 21: Speed Bumps on Life’s Highway

Getting real about the person you’re dating — and leaving your own Fantasy
Island — is important if you want to build a relationship that lasts. The way
you do that is to keep your attention on the here and now, on the date before
you, not on other people you’ve dated before. Here’s how to identify some
warning signs that you’re at risk of judging your date based on a past, future,
or fantasy life. Ask yourself these questions:
 Does my date remind me of anyone? Old girlfriend? The guy who got
away? My mom?
 Do I spend a lot of time thinking about my date’s potential (like, he or
she would be great if only . . .)?
 Do I obsess about what my date meant by something he or she said or did?
 Do I ever feel uneasy when my date says or does something my old girl-
friend or boyfriend used to say or do?
 Do I assume my date feels the same way about me as I feel about him
or her?

Smokey says . . .
Remember the 1989 movie Always, with John
Goodman, Richard Dreyfus, and Holly Hunter
playing forest rangers? (I know it’s based on the
remake of A Man Named Joe, but that movie
was before my time.) At one point, John
Goodman is explaining love to Holly, using the
metaphor of the two kinds of forest fires — one
that is explosive and burns hot and bright and
then burns itself out, and the other kind that is
quieter and less noticeable and dramatic, but if
you put your hand to the ground, you can feel its
heat. It’s the kind of fire that will burn forever.
We’re all enthralled with the idea of love being
the first kind of fire because it’s so dramatic and
beautiful and scary. But if you think about it, it’s
wiser to be drawn to the second kind because
it’ll keep us warm forever.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Remember the song from Guys and Dolls about
marrying the man today and changing his ways
tomorrow? I’m convinced women view men as
clay. They fall in love with them and then decide
to dress ’em differently, teach ’em to talk, to like
ballet, and to be nice to their moms. Men, on the
other hand, want women never to change — to
remain the same size, weight, IQ, and sophisti-
cation she was when they met.
Wow, how do relationships ever work out?
Miraculously, they work out when both people
decide to accept the basics and understand
that change happens but that the most suc-
cessful change is self-generated.

Feeling these things is okay. Judging new folks based on the old folks you
know is understandable. But I want you to be aware of what you’re doing so
you don’t make the mistake of misjudging a date based on something that has
nothing to do with that person. Take it one date at a time, one moment at a
time. Evaluate what’s there, not what could, would, or should be.
Don’t talk about your date with other people until you’re in the Acceleration
Stage (you’ve dated 3 to 6 months and are pretty comfortable with each
other). The fewer people who know you’ve passed the second-date thresh-
old, the better — and that means (especially) your mom and casual friends.
It’s okay to tell your best friend, but the last thing you want is an audience
who can’t wait to hear every juicy detail. Same rule applies to asking your
friends about their post-second dates. Give the thing a chance to get going
before asking how it’s going. With an audience, everything — the good stuff
and especially the bumps — will be exaggerated. I know this is really hard,
and it’s tempting to want to blab in the early first stages, but keeping the
whole thing secret is tantalizing and a lot safer.
Being Patient: You Can’t Hurry Love
Diana Ross was right: You can’t hurry love. You just have to wait. No two
ways about it. True love is a slow-burn. Lust is spontaneous combustion that
soon burns itself out. Here’s how to tell the difference:
 Like: When you like someone, you’re still in checklist mode. You’re keep-
ing a mental scoreboard — plus one for showing up on time, minus one
for taking a call on the cell phone, plus one for laughing at your dumb
joke, minus one for biting fingernails. “Like” is an evaluation of compati-
bility — literally, seeing if you two are enough alike to get along. Think
about how you describe a friend. You go through a list of attributes; it’s
all in sharp focus.

some slack here): A gorgeously dressed man
strolls into in a lovely room with white gossamer
curtains gently blowing in the wind and a can-
delabra with flickering candles; he moves sinu-
ously toward a beautiful woman in a lovely
white gown as she expectantly waits for him to
come to her. The whole scene is beautiful and
blurred in soft focus. Suddenly, he trips on a
tablecloth and spills wine and knocks over a
flower arrangement and breaks the china. The
ad is for a carpet stain remover, but it could just
as easily be an ad for understanding the blur-
ring reality and unrealistic expectations in
dating and the unquenchable need for romance
to the detriment of reason, sanity, and reality —
and your fine china.

 Lust: More physical than mental, lust is tingling fingertips, sweaty palms,
pounding hearts, and breathless kisses. Lust is wanting to engulf some-
one with a bear hug and make out (or more) till the sun comes up. Lust
is powerful and fickle. It’s a sexual faucet that can seem to turn off
almost as quickly as it turns on — pure energy.
 Lust with direction: After date two, before date twenty-two, the LWD
phase is sexy with street smarts. You’ve lost your head over this person
but not your mind. Not only do you desire to whisk him or her off to bed
in a cascade of kisses, but you want to read the morning paper together,
too. And not just the funny pages, either.
 Love: Soft-focus in the best sense of the word. You can see clearly, but
it’s pretty and mellow and pleasing. Most of all, love is about trust and
time — and the time it takes to really trust someone fully. Love isn’t a
mad dash; it’s a slow stroll. It’s compatibility, acceptance, giving as well
as getting, warmth, fun, and shared interests and goals. It’s caring for
someone, not in spite of their flaws but because of them.

Dr. Joy’s love tip
If your date says “I love you” on the first date,
it’s lunacy.
If your date says “I love you” on the second
date, it’s lust.
If your date says “I love you” on the third date,
it’s still lust.
If your date says “I love you” in the fourth
month, it’s lust with direction.
If your date knows your soul and your weight
and your childhood scars and your adulthood
scars and your parents and your most embar-
rassing moments and your dreams and your fail-
ures and says, “I love you, not anyway but
because,” congratulations, it’s love.

Casual, Serious, and Heavy Dating
In This Chapter
 Understanding the differences among casual, serious, and heavy dating
 Understanding what sex is and isn’t
 Determining when to say yes and when to say no to sex
 Evaluating your relationship
W
hen does dating move from the casual phase to the serious phase?
Obviously, the answer is different for every couple and often for both
participants. One of you may view the dating as serious from day one; the other
may never view the dating as serious (which obviously creates lots and lots of
problems for both of you). In this chapter, I give you guidelines from which you
can begin to evolve your own personal perspectives and discuss them together.
Casual vs. Serious vs. Heavy Dating
Any relationship can survive if you’re both on the same wavelength, and any
relationship is going to run into problems if you’re not. Like anything else,
heavy dating may best be defined by what it is and what it isn’t: It’s not
casual dating, and it’s a step beyond serious dating.
Casual dating
Casual dating means that neither of you is taking the relationship terribly
seriously because one or the other of you is
 Dating others: You like each other but see other people as well.
 Living far away from each other: You live so far away that you can see
each other only occasionally.
 Only in town temporarily: This is similar to a holiday romance; you
know that the relationship will last only as long as the business trip,
vacation, or whatever does.

 Not interested in a commitment: You want the relationship to be without
long-term expectations.
 Not being sexual: You’re abstaining.
 Not being seriously sexual: You’re not being monogamous (not a terrific
idea).
 Seeing each other less than twice a week: You get together less than
twice a week, either because you’re not interested in seeing each other
more frequently or because proximity keeps you apart.
Even though no one is crazy about auditioning for the role of significant
other, casual dating has much to recommend it: It allows both parties to get
to know one another without the pressure of exclusivity, and it allows for
comparisons that are natural and not necessarily odious.
Serious dating
Serious dating is a transition between casual dating and heavy dating. With
serious dating,
 Your relationship is exclusive.
 You see each other once or twice a week.
 You live in the same city.
 You are possibly sexual, possibly not.
258
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 
What do men and women really want?
“What on earth does the other sex want?” a lot
of people ask me on my radio program. The
answer is simple. While men and women aren’t
the same, they’re not from different planets,
either. What they all want is this:
 To be accepted for who we are . . . not for
who you think we should be.
 To be known . . . warts and all.
 To be heard . . . even when we say some-
thing you don’t want to hear.
 To be appreciated . . . for small things as
well as big.
 To be cherished.
 To be needed.
 To be wanted.
 To be liked.
 To be loved.

Heavy dating
The idea of dating is to see who’s out there and to keep do-si-doing and
switching off until you find someone who seems a cut above the rest, some-
one worthy of additional time and effort and consideration. Once you decide
that you have someone who is worth abandoning all others for — at least
temporarily — you’ve moved into exclusivity, which is a precursor to heavy
dating. Heavy dating involves:
 Being mutually exclusive by design: You discuss and consciously agree
to see only one another.
 Having three or more dates a week: You take time and effort to be
together often.
 Dating on weekends: You spend weekends together rather than with the
guys or girls, and when you do have to be with others, you often go as a
couple.
 Living in the same area code: Living relatively close to one another
makes it possible to see each other often.
 Often being sexual and, certainly, practicing sexual exclusivity: In
other words, if your relationship includes sex, you are monogamous.
Sexual intimacy, although not necessary to a committed relationship, is often
one of its hallmarks. Whereas some think the key is the “sex” part, the real
key is the “intimacy” part: a connection deep enough to involve body and
soul. But intimacy depends on a number of factors, not just (and not neces-
sarily) on the sex act. If you think that you can achieve intimacy solely
through sex, you’re mistaken.
The Role of Sex in a Relationship
In our society, sex is a big deal. It’s commercialized and romanticized; it’s
used to sell everything from toothpaste to chewing gum, cars to condos,
jeans to Jacuzzis; and it’s wrapped in ribbons and adorned with hearts and
flowers. No wonder there are so many mixed messages. For example:
 Everybody seems to be doing it on sitcoms, afternoon talk shows, the
news, the movies, and the soaps . . . but it’s sacred and special (according
to your pastor and papa).
 To be a great lover, you’ve got to have many partners . . . but save your-
self for the right person.
 Sex is wholesome and natural . . . but venereal disease is a punishment.
259
Chapter 22: Casual, Serious, and Heavy Dating

Wow, if we used the same criteria for words, we’d all stutter all the time, and
sexually we are a stuttering society.
What sex isn’t
I can’t tell you what sex should or shouldn’t mean to you, but I can tell you
what it’s not. Sex is not AIDS, commitment, necessary, wicked, beautiful, ugly.
In its most basic form, it’s scratching an itch. Everything else is something
we project on a very simple act. It’s the psychology, not the biology, that’s
complicated.
What sex is
But sex can be all of those things listed in the preceding section and much
more. It’s you and your body and a way of feeling close to another person.
Whether sex is wicked or beautiful, intimate or ugly, depends on you and
your partner and all the perceptions and feelings and intentions and expecta-
tions you both bring to the party. Whether sex makes you feel close to
another soul depends on you and your partner and timing and position and
the ability to laugh or cry.
Sex occurs everywhere. After all, it’s how little birds and buffaloes and
Bobbies happen. Of course, for most animals and plants, there is a season; in
other words, their sex drives are controlled purely by biology. But although
we humans still have the monthly reproductive cycle, we let our heads and
our hearts and our genitals completely overtake it. Add to that the fact that
sex has various social and economic connotations, based on the societies in
which we live, that affect the meaning and variety and acceptance and rules
of sex. Yeah, the equipment is all the same, but the meaning and variety and
acceptance and rules are all governed by heads and hearts, not genitals. The
point is that we all live in a society that has rules about sex; what’s important
here is what sex means to you and your partner.
260
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 
Virtual sex
What virtual sex and virtual dating often mean
these days is logging on to the Internet and
clicking into an online image gallery, cyber
chats, sex links, virtual sex clubs, or a video
conference call. Most of this stuff is little more
than an online peep show. You have to be at
least 18 to enter, and the costs can really rack
up — they usually charge by the minute.
Be very careful here. It’s expensive, addictive, and
no substitute for the real thing — dating someone
you can actually see, touch, and talk to in person.

If you’re getting the feeling that sex is tricky stuff, you’re right. So what does
this mean to you and your partner?
It means that first and foremost, you have to decide what you want and what
sex means to you. Are you ready to be that open and vulnerable to another
person? Are you ready to be gentle enough with someone who trusts you not
to intentionally harm him or her? Are you prepared for the responsibility of
sexuality with another person? I guarantee you, your body will urge you well
before the rest of you is ready, and that’s the rub, so to speak.
The Thing about Sex
The thing about sex is not that you’re naked physically, but if you do it right,
that you’re naked emotionally. The whole point of dating is to feel connected
and less alone. Sex can certainly accomplish that if both of you are careful. If
you’re only horny, you’re going to either hurt someone or get hurt, and then
you’ll feel lonelier and less connected than before.
In some ways, it’s quite convenient that the urge to merge should be both
sexual and emotional, physical and mental, but we all know that it isn’t
always this way, that sex isn’t necessarily intimacy. Think of the friend you
love but with whom you have no “chemistry”; conversely, think about the
sexy thing you know who is unprincipled, self-centered, and mean and who
has the attention span of a gnat. I know I sound like your cranky Aunt
Mathilde, but if you have to give up one for the other, it’s a better bet to give
up the sex and go for the intimacy. (I hear you — you’re saying “girl thing,”
but guys get tired of meaningless, impersonal sex, too.)
261
Chapter 22: Casual, Serious, and Heavy Dating
Sexual mores
Sexual mores (spoken and unspoken rules) vary
greatly from society to society. Although the
equipment is all the same (regardless of what
you may have heard or would like to believe),
your sexual conduct is governed in large part by
the culture in which you live. The perception of
an exposed female midriff in the Middle East is
vastly different from the same midriff exposed in
the United States, and most Americans would be
aghast at the things exposed on a nude French
beach. The back of a woman’s neck is sexy stuff
in Japan but ignored in America. (Side note:
Sexual mores of a society are often indicated by
the mode of dress or undress of its female citi-
zens because women have historically been sex
objects, while men have embodied power.)

Identifying the right time
The right time to have sex is when you aren’t asking anything more than sex
from your partner. You know this person, like and trust him or her, and aren’t
using sex to get power, presents, or a date or as a sign of anything other than
mutual interest. If you’re looking for signs, read tea leaves or traffic lights. It’s
never the right time until
 You’ve talked about it. By talking about sex, you find out what each of
you thinks (that’s why before you can talk, you have to know your own
mind). If you can’t talk about sex, it’s too soon to have sex; if you don’t
trust each other enough to talk, why would you take your clothes off in
front of the other person?
It’s best to have this conversation about sex when you’re both dressed
and sober.
 You know each other’s middle name. If you don’t know each other’s
middle name, you probably don’t know enough about each other for
this kind of trust and intimacy. (Of course, this doesn’t mean that you’re
ready for sex just because you swap middle names halfway through
your first date.)
 You feel passionate about this person. Sex is urgent. If it weren’t,
who’d go to the trouble? (It is a physically vulnerable position if you
think about it.) If the point of sex were merely species survival, for 
example, why do we humans spend so much time talking and reading
and writing about it?
262
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 
Anticipation
I once did an on-the-air poll about whether
people wished they’d had sex earlier or later in
their lives. Most — 93 percent, in fact — said
that they wished they had waited longer both in
terms of age of first sexual experience and time
in the relationship.
Waiting isn’t so terrible and can even be fun.
Anticipation is a powerful aphrodisiac. The
longer you wait to have sex, the better the foun-
dation, the more you know about each other,
and the easier it is to talk about sexual things
when the time comes.
And even if the sex isn’t great initially, you both
have something to fall back on, so to speak. You
know and like each other, so one mediocre time
in bed doesn’t make either of you bolt. Friends
talk; strangers don’t. When it comes to sex,
friends give you a much safer place to feel 
vulnerable.

But is urgency passion? It can be, but not necessarily. To understand the
difference, think about a full bladder or an excruciatingly tight pair of
shoes. Both situations are urgent, but neither is passion. Now think
about your favorite meal. Yeah, hunger is an urgent need, but passion is
when you care about what slakes your thirst or fills you up. You’re going
for passion here, not urgency.
 You’ve had more than three or four dates. No, this doesn’t mean every-
body has to have sex by the sixth date, but certainly, have it no sooner
than the fourth date. How can you trust your judgment, let alone know
your heart, before that?
 You love touching each other and being touched. You’ve played kissy
face, and there’s a lot of hand-holding going on here. You talk a lot in
person and on the phone.
 You see each other more than once a week. This moves you into seri-
ous and heavy datingland.
 You’re not having sex with anybody else, and your date isn’t either.
You know because you have talked about it together.
If either of you is having sex with someone else, you don’t necessarily
have to stop seeing each other. But good sex feels preemptive, and if
either or both of you are involved sexually with others, that situation
sets up loads of conflicts. It increases the probability of lying, which isn’t
a great idea when you’re trying to develop some intimacy and trust, and
you’ll probably have to deal with jealousy and possessiveness before
you’ve established a basis of knowing and liking and respecting one
another.
 You’re ready to practice safe sex. You are prepared to make sure that
nobody gets pregnant, hurt, diseased, or misunderstood. You have to be
prepared for the responsibility of safe sex — safe medically, emotionally,
and prophylactically. Men and women must both be prepared, so carry a
condom, everybody.
 You’re both ready and having fun. Nobody feels put upon or martyred
or co-opted.
 You’re both willing to deal with the reality that the sex may not be
great for either of you. Men often experience impotence or premature
ejaculation with a new partner, and women often don’t feel comfortable
enough to have an orgasm. If either of these common occurrences would
blow your relationship out of the water, wait until the relationship has
more stability outside the bedroom.
When sex is right, you’re physically and emotionally naked. If your goal is
sexual release and not an emotional connection, seriously consider mastur-
bation. If you still decide to have sex, at least promise yourself to be honest
upfront so that you don’t mislead your partner. Remember, one of the
263
Chapter 22: Casual, Serious, and Heavy Dating

assumptions of this book is that you are not a predator — that is, you’re not
someone who uses or exploits another person just for your own pleasure.
The bottom line is that you have to wake up with yourself every day of your
life, so don’t do something in a fit of sexual heat that is going to make you dis-
like yourself. Lecture is temporarily over.
Saying yes
Saying yes to sex is easy and should be fun once you’ve had the discussion; if
you’re not sure what discussion I’m referring to, see the earlier section
“Identifying the right time.” There is one and only one reason to say yes to
sex: because you honestly and sincerely want to have sex with this person.
The following are not reasons to say yes:
 You want to lose your virginity.
 You want to tell your friends you’ve done it.
 You want to prove you’re not gay.
 You want to prove you’re over your ex.
 You’re afraid that if you don’t say yes to this person, someone else will.
 Dinner was good.
 You’re high.
 You’re low.
 You’re tired of saying no.
 You’re afraid.
 You want him or her to call you again.
 You never want him or her to call you again.
 You feel sorry for him or her.
If the sex is good, I don’t need to give you hints. Enjoy. If the sex isn’t so good,
keep in mind that some things take getting used to. Remember the first time
you danced (probably no one mistook you for Fred or Ginger) or played
mixed doubles (maybe you both ran to the net when one should have stayed
behind). Getting in sync physically with another person takes time, patience,
and a little practice, unless you’re really lucky.
Keep a couple of things in mind about saying no:
 When you want to say no, just say no. It’s okay to explain why it’s not no
forever but no for now because “I want to wail until . . .”
• “We’re married.”
• “We’re engaged.”
264
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

• “I’m sure.”
• “I know you better.”
• “You know me better.”
• “My infection clears up.”
• “I’m sure I’m straight.”
Remember: Saying no has always been okay. See the next section for
tips on how to say no.
 Just because you said yes once doesn’t mean you have to say yes again,
this time or ever, to that person.
Saying no
Saying no is everybody’s right and privilege. Lots of folks say no all the time.
Just make sure that you never say no when you mean “convince me” or
“maybe.” Regardless of the circumstances, no means no, no ifs, ands, buts,
or I-thought-you-wanted-it, or I-know-you-want-it, or I-promise-I’ll-stop-when-
you-want-me-to, or any of the other responses to no. No means “Stop! Go no
further.” Period. Just so there is no misunderstanding on what part of no you
understand
 No means no. If you want to be convinced, say so.
 Women own their own sexuality as much as men. Guys, you can say no
for any reason. Gals, you can say no for any reason.
 If you know you’re going to say no eventually, make that point
upfront so you don’t mislead anyone.
 If you change your mind either way, say so.
Soul Mates: Fact or Fiction?
Everybody’s looking for a soul mate, a carbon copy of feelings, thoughts, and
values. We have been brainwashed into thinking that somewhere there is a
mirror image of who we are, who is as much like us as a pea in a pod, which
means we never have to change a thing or adapt or compromise. You can see
why this is such a seductive thought but also completely silly.
Be careful of assuming the two of you are destined to be together. Doing so
can make you overlook important distinctions, like that one of you is a morn-
ing person and the other is grumpy; one of you loves rare steak, and the other
is a vegetarian; one is in the National Rifle Association, and the other is for
265
Chapter 22: Casual, Serious, and Heavy Dating

gun control. Believing in soul mates can also make you much more vulnerable
to the all-or-nothing school of relationships, where someone must be exactly
like you in all things or completely unworthy of your time.
Relationships aren’t made in heaven or previous lives. They are living,
breathing entities that require the same care and nurturing that any other
living thing requires. If you buy into the soul mate nonsense, you’re much
less likely to do the work and have a reality-based relationship.
Fish or Cut Bait: Relationship Evaluation
There comes a time in any dating situation where you have to decide whether
to go to the next stage or the next relationship. Going to the next relationship
is exciting and can re-create the fun early days of getting to know someone.
But if you’re not careful, you may find yourself doing only dessert and never
the meal, because in dating the dessert part comes first. If you’re looking
exclusively for excitement, it always makes sense to move on. If you’re look-
ing for intimacy and even semipermanence, sooner or later, you have to trade
off novelty for depth. How can you tell if you’re settling or steering?
The following questions help you evaluate your relationship. The list of ques-
tions is divided into particular areas. Answering these questions can help
you decide whether it’s time to move on or move up. Keep track of your
answers in your dating notebook (see Chapter 1).
 Compatibility
• How much time do you spend together?
• How much do you enjoy your time together?
• Is your time together increasing or decreasing?
• How much do you have in common?
• Do you fight a lot or a little?
 Common interests
• Do you like to do the same things?
• Do you have friends in common?
• Do you like each other’s friends, family?
• Are you each willing to try something new together?
• Are your religious convictions and behaviors compatible?
• Do you like the same kind of music, sports, and so on?
266
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

 Goals
• Do you have the sense that you want the same things in life?
• Are you at the same stage of life?
• Are you both headed in the same direction?
• Do you want the same thing from a relationship?
• Do you have similar ideas about money and time?
 Background
Note: While opposites can attract and then aggravate the daylights out
of one another, common backgrounds allow the two of you to respond in
similar ways.
• Are you equally comfortable talking about feelings, friends, work,
external events, and so on?
• Do you both come from screamer families or sulker families?
• Do you share religious, educational, and economic backgrounds?
• Do you both spend about the same amount of time and energy
with your families?
• What part do family traditions play in your interactions, and are
they compatible?
• Do you both feel essentially the same about alcohol, smoking,
drugs, sex, and rock and roll?
 Fun
• Do you share a sense of what’s fun?
• How high do each of you rate leisure time?
• Do you do fun things together?
• Do you share a sense of humor, adventure?
 Energy
• Are both of you morning people? Night people?
• Are you both couch potatoes or exercise freaks?
• Are you both hyper or laid-back?
• Are you both healthy?
 Problem-solving
• Are either of you control freaks?
• Do you listen to one another?
267
Chapter 22: Casual, Serious, and Heavy Dating

• Are you able to negotiate?
• Do you ever disagree?
• Are you afraid to be angry or make the other person angry?
• Are you possessive?
• Is jealousy clouding your discussions of other things?
• Are you able to solve problems and move on?
• When you argue, do you insult each other?
The purpose of these questions is not to tally up points so that you can fit
your relationship into one of three categories, like the two of you are okay,
need a couples’ counselor, or are toxic for one another. The purpose of these
questions is to help you understand what you should be asking when you
think about your relationship. When you evaluate your answers, try for the
middle ground:
 Don’t settle for a lousy dating situation because you’re afraid to be
alone. Being lonely because you’re not seeing someone is one thing;
being alone in a bad relationship is a lot worse and even lonelier.
 Don’t jettison a perfectly good relationship because it’s not perfect.
There aren’t perfect people, so it stands to reason that there aren’t per-
fect relationships. If you took a job and never learned new skills and
kept doing the same old thing, you’d get either bored or fired or both.
Why should relationships be any different? You need to grow and change
and work to make love rich and powerful and rewarding.

Breaking Up
In This Chapter
 Knowing the warning signs of a relationship in trouble

 Scoping out causes of a breakup
 Saving your relationship
 Ending with dignity
 Healing after a breakup
D
ating is usually about wanting to make sure that the time and effort
being invested pay off, so the hope is that the relationship will last for-
ever (assuming it’s wonderful and positive). The reality is that relationships
don’t always last. You may be comforted to remind yourself that people are
put into our lives for one of three purposes: a reason, a season, or a lifetime:
 A reason may be a specific need to be met, a lesson learned, assistance,
guidance, or support — something that we haven’t been paying attention
to. It’s the Universe’s way of saying, wake up! We may have decided that
we’re too old or too unlovable or that we’re fine by ourselves. Someone is
then put in your path to remind us of the fun of having somebody with
whom to share our life and by definition, once that support has been ten-
dered, lesson learned, guidance given, it’s time to move on, however
painfully.
 A season offers us the chance to share, to grow, to learn a lesson that
hasn’t yet been learned. The lesson may be to be patient, more outgoing,
or a bit more generous. Once we’ve learned or taught that lesson, the
person who teaches or was taught is no longer necessary or relevant, so
he or she moves on.
 Then there’s the wonderful category in which most of us invest
heavily, which is a lifetime and beyond, a person with whom we build
a foundation.
Because a relationship didn’t or doesn’t last doesn’t mean that it’s not valu-
able, productive, positive, or even anybody’s fault.

Like the song says, breaking up is hard to do. You’ve invested time and effort
and emotion, but the relationship is just not working. Most people know well
in advance when things aren’t working out, but the world is divided into two
sets of people: those who hang on too long and those who don’t hang on long
enough.
Aha, you’re asking yourself, what about people who get out at the exact right
time? Theoretically they exist, but knowing the exact time to split is generally
something understood in retrospect.
Painful as it may be to contemplate, it’s likely that all of us will face a breakup
or two in our lifetime, so we may as well be prepared. In this chapter, I detail
the warning signs of a breakup, the how and when of discussing an impend-
ing breakup with a partner, and include a list of the most common reasons
causing splitsville. Before you are completely bummed out, there is a first aid
kit of things to do that may save a relationship and advice on how to say it’s
over and what to do after you’ve called it quits.
Decoding Warning Signs
People stay in relationships that aren’t working so that they don’t have to be
alone, don’t have to be alone for the holidays, a wedding, a vacation, a birth-
day, Mom’s anniversary. They may think “This relationship isn’t terrific, but
it’s better than the last one — or better than none at all.”
But how do you know it’s time to call it quits? You can count on a few warn-
ing signs:
 You fight over nothing.
 You’re not as affectionate.
 You don’t see what you ever saw in this person.
 You decided all your friends were right and have been all along.
 Your parents absolutely adore your date and that really frosts you.
 If there was ever sex, it has stopped.
 More time passes between dates.
 There are longer and longer silences.
 You start mentally (and maybe verbally, but I hope not) comparing your
date unfavorably to others.
 You are more tempted by others.
270
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

 You’re looking for excuses to be alone but not together.
 You’re looking for excuses to hang out with other couples.
 You have no long-term plans.
 You take separate vacations.
 You buy a car, house, or pet without consulting or informing the other
person.
 You’re never there when he/she calls.
 You don’t return your date’s phone calls.
 You get a post office box.
 Your date moved, neglected to inform you, and didn’t leave a forwarding
address.
 You have your number changed and don’t tell.
 A love child has been left on your front porch.
Hey, look, hopefully it hasn’t gotten as bad as all that, but some people have a
hard time letting go. You might convince yourself that just a little more effort
or time or a good therapist would do the trick. The first thing you need to do,
though, is figure out whether you’re the only one who has noticed that things
aren’t going well or whether both of you seem to be miserable. If you feel that
most of the preceding warning signs apply to you, it’s time to call a halt. If your
partner seems to be the unhappy one, it’s perfectly reasonable to sit down in a
public place (without alcohol) and say, “I’ve noticed that we’re fighting a lot or
not spending much time together. Do you want to see whether we can fix
things, or do we have a dead fish here?”
Look, if your relationship gives you more misery than pleasure and more pain
than fun, sit down with a pencil and paper and figure out what you want and
what you’re willing to offer to get it. If you discover that there is nothing the
other person can give (or anything you’re willing to relinquish), that should
tell you something. Similarly, if you’re in a relationship that used to work but
has now turned rancid because one of you has moved or changed or cheated,
you can’t go back, but you can evaluate whether there is anything your part-
ner can offer that has value to you and anything that you’re willing to offer to
get it. If so, get busy and figure it out and offer it. If not, it’s time to do that
grown-up thing and break up without bloodshed or nastiness.
Breaking up is as important a skill as any other part of dating. It’s not fair to
just disappear without a word. The world’s too small a place, and you’re too
big a person, so don’t even think about it.

Chapter 23: Breaking Up

Dealing with Evidence of Problems
While it usually takes six to nine months for a couple to decide whether or
not a dating situation has the potential to become a relationship with a capi-
tal R, the bad news can become much more evident much sooner:
 If you’ve been out on only a couple of dates, there can be any number
of reasons why things aren’t working, including things beyond either of
your control — work, family, finances, health problems — and it’s some-
times hard to admit your confusion or unhappiness to someone you like
but don’t know very well.
 If the problem is just that the two of you have gone about as far as you
can go, it’s probably pretty apparent to you both. If you’re really brave,
you can talk about the specifics, which are listed in the next section. A
cowardly no-no is to weasel out by not asking the person out and seem-
ing to be really busy. The problem with this approach is twofold: First, it
isn’t very good communication (or very honest). Second, if the other
person is really nice, he or she may be very understanding about how
busy you are, and that makes you feel even worse. It’s better to explain
that the dating scenario just isn’t working out and why.
 If both of you seem to be mutually uncomfortable, the problem is a lot
easier to handle, and if you’re honest without being brutal, you may
even become long-term friends and go on to introduce each other to
future dates.
The problem occurs when one person is seemingly content and the other is
miserable. (But don’t be fooled by a difference in styles. If one of you is really
miserable, chances are the other person isn’t having all that much fun either
but may have a less confrontational style, be a better actor, be clingier, or have
a worse track record, which tends to make people hang on for a longer time.)
 If you’re the one having the problems, I encourage you to be honest and
ask for help or a time-out rather than act aloof or uninterested. If the
relationship has some potential, it’s a lot easier to resume if the other
person doesn’t feel trashed.
 If you’re the one who wants out, you have an obligation to be kind but
honest. If you’re the one who’s being dumped (pardon the expression),
you have a right to ask why, if you can do it without whining.
 If your partner seems to be having the problem, it’s all right to say,
“Seems to me you’re a bit distracted these days. If you feel comfortable
talking to me about it, maybe I can help, or if you’d rather not, I under-
stand if you need to take a break right now.” These days, most people
feel they’re better jugglers than they really are, and just having someone
acknowledge that you don’t have to be perfect can feel really good and
be quite a relief.
272
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Okay, it’s obvious nothing is working: You’ve talked and tried, but it’s just not
much fun anymore and seems more trouble than it’s worth. Get out your dating
notebook (see Chapter 1). No, you’re not going to write a Dear John or Jane
letter; you’re going to do some soul and relationship searching. Do an inven-
tory of what’s working and what’s not by being very, very specific. For exam-
ple, maybe you can talk (good) but the sex stinks (not so good). Weekends are
okay, but you snarl at each other on Wednesdays; his mother is great, yours is
driving you both nuts. The more specific your list, the cleaner the path. And
don’t ever be tempted to say, “we can’t communicate.” Communicate about
what?!
Understanding the Break Up
People do things for reasons, and dating works or doesn’t work for a surpris-
ingly limited number of reasons: timing, incompatibility, money, geography,
and so on. The following sections look at how each reason can and does
impact the intimacy and time involvement necessary to move a dating situa-
tion forward.
Timing
This factor tops the list because if you both have time, everything else can be
sorted out. If you don’t have time, even the most compatible of couples is
going to hit the wall.
Your timing can be off because one of you isn’t out of a relationship, isn’t fin-
ished with school, or isn’t old enough or young enough, or you should have
met earlier or later in your lives. This is the stuff of which heartaches and
country songs are written. If not now, maybe later, and if not later, maybe
your next life or last life.
273
Chapter 23: Breaking Up
Trading up
I once interviewed a man who said each of us
should get in touch with exes who had dumped
us. His position was that we should thank them
because we could not go on and date more
wonderful people until we had gotten out of a
non-workable relationship, and some people
are just better at noting the handwriting on the
wall, even if it is graffiti. He contended that we
never go backward: The next person is always
better than the last because we know that
someone at least that cool and good and kind
and smart and cute exists, so we’ll never settle
for less.
An interesting, optimistic, and comforting
notion.

Timing is a huge stumbling block, but it is not very negotiable, at least for the
time being. If one of you is at one stage of commitment and the other isn’t
there yet, a classic way of dealing with the timing issue is to let some time
elapse and see whether anything changes. I recommend six months apart
with a ten-minute phone call on a designated day once a month so that no
panic sets in. If you’ve been together less than six months, dispense with 
the phone call and agree to meet for lunch in six months, provided both are
interested.
Incompatibility
Sometimes perfectly nice people just want completely different things in life,
have different rhythms, different energies, different belief systems. These
incompatibilities aren’t necessarily instantly obvious, so it can take time to
unearth them, but once they’re out in the open, they’re really hard to negoti-
ate. Following are examples of significant incompatibilities:
 One of you wants to travel; the other one wants to settle down.
 One of you wants kids now; the other wants to finish a college degree.
 One wants a Porsche; the other wants a poodle.
274
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 
The six-to-nine-month itch
Perfectly viable relationships hit the watershed
area around the sixth through ninth month. At
this point, it’s no longer just a brand-new thing,
and nobody can keep up the pretenses for that
long. You’re both seeing who you really are. It’s
about this time that you either fish or cut bait,
either move on to becoming a full-fledged rela-
tionship (my next book) or remain in dating 
purgatory, having neither the fun and excite-
ment and awkwardness of getting to know
one another nor the richness and serenity of
moving to a deeper level of involvement and
commitment.
You and I both know couples who seem to stay
in six-month relationships forever and ever. Not
a cool idea. If somehow you’ve gotten yourself
in a relationship that has become long distance,
unless you’ve known each other for a year or
more and have been apart for a short period of
time with intent to resume the relationship
within a month or so, follow the rules for long-
distance relationships. Long-distance relation-
ships are primarily based on fantasy (you’re
apart a lot more than you’re together) and have
to be managed in completely different ways
than traditional dating, which moves into seri-
ous and then heavy dating patterns.

Some things are negotiable, but if the basics aren’t in place (those things that
are hugely important to the two of you — shared goals, attitudes, values),
you’ll spend all your time negotiating, leaving very little time or energy for
true crises because everything seems like a crisis.
Obviously the two of you connected on some level, or you wouldn’t have
gotten this far. Being incompatible doesn’t mean that one of you is right and
the other wrong; it just means that you’re wrong for each other. The more
specific and honoring of the differences you can be, the easier the split is —
making it bittersweet rather than just bitter.
Hauntings by ghosts
Old loves leave impressions. A song, a smell, a look, a place can conjure up a
love that was. This is why the time rule, so the ghosts can find a resting place
that’s not actively in your head or heart.
But sometimes someone from the past pops up and completely disrupts a per-
fectly good relationship. It’s not that anything’s wrong; it’s just that the prior
situation seems more right, no matter how careful you are about waiting until
someone is completely out of a relationship (the one-year-past-divorce rule,
for example). These things happen. If it happens to you (whether the resurfac-
ing former love is yours or your partner’s), believe in kismet and don’t take it
personally — and don’t be sneaky or vindictive, either. Sometimes we just
have to bow to Fate. Fortunately, it doesn’t happen all that often.
Geography
Long-distance relationships stink. They have too much of a fantasy compo-
nent with too little reality. If you are dating someone you see less than a
couple of times a month because of distance, you need to adopt the Clinton
plan: Don’t ask, don’t tell — what the other person is doing, whom they’re
with, where they were when you called — and don’t consider it a “real” rela-
tionship until the two of you live within the same area code and can see each
other at least a couple of times a week. (Browne doctrine also dictates you
don’t live together, and both of you get jobs and date each other “normally”
and see what develops.)
This is another case of not no, just not now.
275
Chapter 23: Breaking Up

Sex
Initial attraction can wear thin even if you’re not hitting the sheets, and
because we’re talking dating and not friendship here, a complete waning of
sexual interest or attraction doesn’t bode well for the dating part. You may
turn out to be great friends, but dating assumes some sexual interest.
Obviously, some minor change in the initial excitement is not unusual, but
what you hope for here is a deepening of the interest and immersion in the
other person’s soul — as well as body — rather than ennui or boredom.
If you’ve become a sexual predator who is just interested in conquest, it’s time
to get some help, not a date. Not only will you be hurting other people who
are silly enough to love you, but you’ll view yourself, with some accuracy, as
a creep, and I guarantee that the only person you’ll always end up in bed with
is yourself. Hating yourself isn’t a good basis for dating or anything else.
Money
A huge discrepancy in financial resources can cause problems, especially if
you didn’t know about the discrepancy up front or if someone’s situation
has changed. Even winning the lottery is surprisingly hard on relationships.
Losing a job or having a car stolen or major medical problems all create emo-
tional problems, but then having to deal with the money factor is also very
difficult. Do you borrow money, loan money, talk about money, ignore it?
When you get down to it, money isn’t just inert, wrinkly, green stuff; it’s
power and lifestyle and freedom and self-definition. One person getting or
losing a lot of it undoubtedly changes things.
276
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 
Kismet kiss-off
One of the nicest brush-offs I ever got was from
a guy I’d been seeing for a week or two who
explained to me a ghost had reappeared in his
life, someone he hadn’t seen or heard from in
years, and he felt he needed to pursue the ghost
so that he could either put the whole thing to
rest or marry her. He ended up marrying her and
inviting me to the wedding. I remember it as
being a classy way to tell me not to wait by the
phone.

Friends and family
The approval or disapproval of important people in your life about your date
matters very little at the beginning but more and more as time goes by. It
matters not only because the juggling that is necessary becomes more char-
acteristic of longer term relationships but also because a longer-term rela-
tionship gets taken more seriously by all parties. Friends who may have been
amused or stunned are now actively and vocally worried, and parents who
didn’t know one way or the other or thought it was a passing phase are now
weighing in with their two cents’ worth. Tricky stuff.
If you’re old enough to be reading this book by yourself, you’re old enough to
make your own decisions, but support from friends and family is a lot easier
than active opposition. If nothing else, it’s important to listen to their con-
cerns. After all, they do love you. That doesn’t mean that they know what’s
best, but they do have a different perspective. It is never okay to say, “I’m
breaking up because my friends hate you,” but it is okay to listen to your
friends’ concern and see whether it squares with that quiet little voice in
your own head that you’ve been ignoring.
If you’re dating someone just to make people you love miserable, you’re a
mean, self-involved child, and you should go to your room and repent now.
There are better ways to show your independence — like moving out, getting
a job, and making a success of yourself and your life — than finding someone
to serve as a symbol of your rebelliousness. Grow up.
Kids
One of you wanting them and the other not is not very negotiable, and hope-
fully you sorted this out before the two of you got involved. (If not, make sure
you do the next time.) If you’re sure you don’t want kids and have absolutely
no doubt, get yourself sterilized, get a T-shirt that says as much, and never
take it off: You’ll save yourself a serious amount of heartache. If you’ve
changed your mind, be honest about it; people do change. Still, it’s a hard
issue to compromise.
A major cause of breakups of otherwise promising relationships is someone
else’s kids. If you or your date has kids from previous relationships, it’s a
good idea to make sure your relationship has legs before you get the kids
involved. Once the kids are involved, they become attached, and the relation-
ship between the adults becomes that much trickier. If the two of you are
really cooking, but the kids hate the idea, you may want to seek out some
good couples’ counseling before you call it a day. Kids can be incredibly dis-
ruptive, but adults owe kids even when it’s hard on a social life.
277
Chapter 23: Breaking Up

Work
The M.A.S.H. philosophy of life is the assumption that you can find all of your
goodies in one place: your father figure, your social and sex lives, your work,
your neighbors, your meals, and anything else your little heart desires. Both
men and women are spending more time at work these days — an average of
45 hours (out of 168) per week plus commute time — resulting in a serious
proportion of awake time devoted to work. Most of us see more of our col-
leagues and bosses than we do our families. So there is a tendency to make
colleagues our surrogate family — always a bad idea because work is about
competence. Anything that gets in the way of competence is the enemy at
work. Believe that there is nothing that gets in the way of competence more
than an office romance. Even though you may think that no one knows,
people always do. (Think about it. You always know when somebody is get-
ting it on.) These days the law not only forbids sexual harassment but also
sexual acting out at the office. I have a friend who got sued because she was
having an affair with the boss. Her co-workers sued because they felt the
affair was creating an overly sexualized environment and suspected that she
got special privileges. In the bad old days, when office affairs occurred, the
woman traditionally was fired because the man was usually in the position of
more power; however, these days, men are getting fired as well.
Whether the law gets involved or not, having all your eggs in one basket is a
lousy idea. And should the two of you break up, you’ve got a real disaster on
your hands because throwing ourselves into work to get over an unhappy
love affair is a standard response to heartache, and if it is all happening in the
same place, you’re very likely to lose your love, your job, and your marbles.
So although having your work life and your love life in the same place may
seem efficient initially, it can be incredibly dangerous. So don’t even think
about it.
In addition to the pitfalls that work can present to both sexes in terms of
temptation and distraction, guys have an added burden. Most men between
the ages of 25 and 55 are defined by their work. Is this reasonable or right?
Probably not, but it’s true. If you try to get between a man and his job, you’ll
lose, even if you win. When a man feels his work is getting away from him, he
feels he is dying, and he will jettison everything else to save this part of him-
self. Unfortunately, as more and more women enter the work force, they are
taking on some of the same characteristics.
Traditionally, women have defined themselves in terms of their love, and men
have defined themselves in terms of their work. It’s changing, but not all that
quickly. Hopefully we can learn from each other, but a man whose work is in
trouble is a man who is going to have a hard time balancing a relationship.
Freud said it all when he said, “We all need work and love.”
278
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Health
A major illness can scare the daylights out of anyone. It’s not only the scare,
but also how the partner responds, that impacts a relationship. Health prob-
lems sap energy and humor and time and money, and a serious illness can
either cement a relationship or give both people pause when thinking how
the other would respond in the future.
No one likes to think of himself or herself as a fair weather friend, but before
“I do,” not everybody is in it for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health.
Substance abuse
If you’re in a relationship with someone who has a drug problem, whether the
drug is alcohol or cocaine or marijuana or prescriptions or crack or any of
the other ways people have invented to make themselves temporarily happy
and truly miserable for the long term, you need to think about bailing. Getting
clean and sober is hard work and doesn’t leave any time for anything other
than that task.
If you’re the person with the problem, do yourself a favor and get yourself
straight before you inflict yourself on someone else. Your partner can’t love
you if you’re high, and you won’t even know who the real person is.
If you love someone with a drug problem, you don’t really know the person
and you can’t trust him or her. You don’t have to hate them, but you do have
to leave until he or she straightens out.
If someone’s drowning and you don’t know how to swim, don’t go in after the
person. You’ll both perish, and if someone comes along to help, the rescuer
will have to choose which of you to save. Save yourself, and let your partner
do the same.
Lack of trust
You can’t love someone you can’t trust. Once trust has been breached, it
takes time and effort to repair the tear, and it’s never like it was before. When
trust has been broken, the wounded party has the right to ask why, how the
transgressor can promise both of you it won’t happen again, and what the
penance is for the next time. Without that kind of three-part understanding,
being together is hard.
279
Chapter 23: Breaking Up

Both of you need to be aware of what the understanding was and why the
breach happened. Taking time off can allow some of the pain to diminish, but
it still takes a lot of work to put things back on some kind of even keel.
Violence
If you are in a violent relationship, get out now.
 If you’re the violent one, get away from your target and get some help.
 If you’re the target, get away now. You’re not doing anybody any good by
allowing yourself to be used as a punching bag.
Making Last-Ditch Efforts
When you know the relationship is in trouble, for whatever reason, you may
not be ready to give up on it yet. This section gives you some ideas of things
to try that may make a difference.
Apologizing
Unless you’re completely sure that your relationship is toast, the end bitter
or not, you may want to try the greatest cure for couple misery ever
invented: the apology. An apology is only really useful if it’s sincere, specific,
and timely. If you did something wretched and thoughtless and selfish —
look, you’re human, not perfect — be specific and grovel. The bigger the boo-
boo, the larger the apology. If the mistake hurt your partner, the apology
should pinch your soul, your pocketbook, and your conscience. This isn’t
about buying your way out but rather reminding yourself and your partner
that you are truly sorry. If repentance is expensive enough, it may give you
pause the next time you’re tempted to blunder in that direction again.
It does no good to say “I’m sorry” if you’re not: It means you’re lying, and
you’ll only make the situation worse. If you don’t feel you did anything wrong,
try problem-solving, not apologizing. Also, saying, “I’m sorry you feel that
way” is not an apology. It’s sniveling and self-serving and mean, so don’t even
think about it.
280
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Taking responsibility
Sometimes you get caught, and try as you may to wiggle out of it, you find out
it’s just too late. Too late is when your partner’s anger and tears and passion
have all been replaced by bland uncaring. You may think this indifference is
easier to deal with, but it signals that you are closer to the end than you want
to be.
If your latest boo-boo meets with resignation rather than rage, you’re in trouble
and maybe out of chances. When what you’ve done in the past simply doesn’t
work anymore, your apology may be too little, too late. What this means is
that, when in doubt, don’t try and get away with something important. Face
up, apologize, and take responsibility, because once your partner doesn’t care
anymore about your mistakes or your apologies, your partner doesn’t care any-
more about you.
Keeping your fantasies to yourself
Look, there are always temptations in this life: a dollar to pocket that’s not
yours, a tax form to cheat on, a cute face at work, a stolen kiss or drink, a
broken promise, a sense of who will ever know. There is a part of all of us that
finds temptation sexy (otherwise, it wouldn’t be called temptation), but if
you’re tempted to stray, at least be smart enough not to be tempted to con-
fess. If your partner has received no pleasure from your behavior, your part-
ner shouldn’t have to suffer any pain.
If you find yourself constantly tempted by another person, maybe it’s time to
sort out whether you are looking for an excuse to bail from your current rela-
tionship, and if so, you need to take a good look at your relationship and
either fix it or leave it. Whatever you do, don’t complicate it by cheating. In
the long run, cheaters cheat themselves first and foremost. There are better
ways to get out of a relationship than being thrown out for being a liar and a
cheat.
There is nothing wrong about feeling tempted as long as you don’t act out the
temptation. Remember, fantasies can be useful pressure valves if you keep your
mouth shut. Part of the reason it makes sense to toe the line is to have a clear
conscience and not have to confess or apologize or hurt someone you love.
Avoiding ship-sinking mistakes
Never move against your own best interest. If you want the relationship to
last, work on it. If you feel it’s beyond redemption, leave because you feel it’s
281
Chapter 23: Breaking Up

over, not because you think the other person will leave if you don’t. If you
want the relationship, work on it; don’t leave something you think is still
viable.
No one likes to feel foolish, but doing something absolutely stupid to save
yourself from the imagined pain of being left by someone is not a terrific idea.
First of all, the person who leaves always feels guilty, at least for a while, and
it’s hard to feel guilty when you feel justified. So don’t problem-solve by doing
the following:
 Having an affair
 Pretending not to care
 Getting violent
 Getting the kids/friends/relatives involved in a who-do-you-love-better
contest
 Playing the martyr
None of it will work and is guaranteed to make everything even messier.
Taking time out
It’s okay to take mini-breaks if you think you can gain something by doing so.
Sometimes both partners can use the perspective of missing one another,
and decreasing the day-to-day aggravation and unhappiness. Maybe one or
the other of you is going through a tough time and needs some space. Maybe
outside factors make it impossible to give the relationship the time and effort
required for it to thrive. As long as both of you can agree on what the pur-
pose of the time apart is, what the rules are, and why you both think it’s a
good idea, time can really be used to your advantage.
 If the two of you are crazy about each other, and one wants a break and
the other doesn’t, take a break.
 If the two of you are crazy about each other and can’t get along, take a
break and think about doing some couples’ work together.
 If one of you is ready for the next step and the other isn’t, take a break.
When you reconnect, you may have moved closer together in your
thinking.
 If both of you are bored or violent or uninterested, take a permanent
break. See the section “Making a Clean Break,” later in this chapter.
Time apart is the hole in the donut: It is defined by what goes on around it.
Because you can’t make someone love you more, you can give both of you
a breather to figure out what’s going on in your head and heart and other
282
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

organs. A breakup can be mini or maxi, temporary or permanent, but if you
work it right, it can be a really important learning experience.
As is true of most things in life, timing is crucial. Be willing to see whether
your relationship can stand time apart as well as time together.
Making a Clean Break
Okay, okay, the relationship isn’t working for you. It really is the end. Now the
goal is to end it with minimum blood loss, nastiness, and pain. When you
finally decide to make the break, how do you actually go about doing it? This
section gives you some ideas.
Avoiding blame
The first temptation to be avoided is the need to blame somebody or some-
thing. Because there are only the two of you, it’s logical that you will decide,
heroically of course, to make it all your fault, even though you know it’s not
true: “You’re too good for someone like me,” “I don’t deserve you,” — both of
which mean you want out now. Or you could blame your partner: “You never
loved me enough,” “You cared more about your work than you did me,”
“You’ve never really gotten over your first love,” “You’ve put on weight, lost
hair, gotten moody. . . .” Yada, yada, yada.
It’s not necessary to fall into either trap. All you have to do to be dignified
about this whole unpleasant thing — breaking up is never easy — is to be
specific about your feelings without laying blame. It really doesn’t matter in
the long run whose fault it is, and avoiding blame spares you both a lot of
bloodshed.
To avoid the blame game, try saying, “I feel . . .” rather than “You are . . .” and
no, it isn’t kosher to say, “I feel you’re a rat.” The “I feel” rather than “You are”
scenario is only okay if you follow up with something about yourself, like, “I
feel neglected when you work weekend after weekend.” (Of course, if you had
been able to say this when you were feeling it, the relationship might not be
beyond redemption at this point.) If you’re specific now, at least both of you
can look at the data as dispassionately as possible rather than feel that either
of you failed.
Don’t ask why
Once a relationship is over, the “why” is less relevant than the “how” — how
are we both going to walk away and be able to live our lives without scars or
283
Chapter 23: Breaking Up

regrets? Let me reiterate that trying to read someone else’s mind and motiva-
tion is a waste of time — understanding your own is crucial! Sometimes a per-
fectly good relationship is only a perfectly good relationship for a while. That
doesn’t mean it was bad, only that it wasn’t long-term.
If the two of you are specific, you’ll know what went wrong and what, per-
haps, either of you could do differently next time. The why may be lost in the
mists of time or be a proper subject for therapy, but when you’re going your
separate ways, getting stuck in the past feels incredibly painful. The why is in
the past, often clouded and sometimes unknowable. Once you’re reduced to
asking why, you’re both sunk, and there are no comforting reasons to be had.
Beyond the Breakup
You probably thought that the hardest part of breaking up was getting up the
nerve to tell your partner why and actually doing it. Yes and no. Because
you’re not a robot and you cared about this person, it’s very likely that you
have at least one or two teeny, tiny reservations. Maybe a part of you even
wanted your partner to argue with you and explain why you were all wrong
and everything was going to be fine and you’d both be happy again. This may
be especially true if your partner agreed that it was time to pull the plug and
call it quits, thereby depriving you of the opportunity to prove your case. All
of us believe much more strongly if we can convince ourselves by stating our
case against opposition.
Now you’re broken up. You’ve gone through the first hard part, the misery
has ended, but another kind of misery is about to begin: the unhappiness of
doubt, the “did I do the right thing” second-guessing. You’ll do this whether
or not you’ve got someone waiting in the wings (if you do, it’s important that
you not only read, but also memorize Chapter 24 to save yourself shame,
grief, and gobs of misery).
This section gives you tips on how to make the aftermath of a breakup a pro-
ductive time.
Looking for patterns
If this isn’t your first breakup — and if you’re old enough to read, chances are
it isn’t — take this opportunity to privately examine whether your relation-
ships are following a pattern, beginning with your first love in second grade
who hit you with the teeter-totter.
Do you pick unavailable people and then feel neglected when they’re unavail-
able? Do you need to be in control all the time or else you feel anxious? Do
you take care of people and then get angry when they don’t take care of you,
284
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

even though you’ve set yourself up as the caretaker (which is really just a
variation on being a control freak)?
Looking for patterns is a really good thing to do for yourself because most
people get involved again eventually (and, usually, much too soon, before
they’ve sorted out the last disaster). You’ll most likely want to get involved
again, too, and knowing your patterns may help you avoid making the same
mistakes.
Talking to your partner about the patterns you see in yourself isn’t very pro-
ductive. And puh-leeeze don’t, under any circumstance, point out the pat-
terns you see in your partner’s behavior. You’re not the parent or the
therapist, and no matter how keen your insight, your remarks will be viewed
as self-serving. So keep those deathless pearls for a hundred years from now
when you’re the best of friends, and even then, best swallow them.

Parental influence and self-fulfilling prophecies
One of the most important places to look for the
genesis of any dating breakup is with your par-
ents. This doesn’t necessarily mean your par-
ents didn’t approve, although that may offer
some insight, but the real question is, were you
being rebellious or trying to get attention or
punish old Mom and Dad for not loving you
enough? I’m talking about something a bit more
psychological and buried, not only how your
parents treated each other — after all, watch-
ing Mom and Dad is the place we first learn how
men and women behave to one another — but
also your relationship with both of your parents.
If you felt Dad was never there for you, are you
picking a date who is aloof like your dad and
hoping if you can just make this aloof person
love you then your relationship with Dad will be
okay? This tendency may or may not be con-
scious, but if you look for it, you may find it. And
of course, you’re dooming yourself because
you’ve picked a person who has a hard time
showing affection again, and those folks always
seem aloof. Talk about your self-fulfilling
prophecy.
It isn’t always about Dad either. If you felt Mom
always loved your brother best, have you picked
a nurturing person who will be a good parent to
your children in the future but who will then
make you feel that you are second best to your
own offspring?
No matter who our parents are or how they
raised us, the rules get changed every ten or fif-
teen years, so parents, by definition, are always
wrong. You don’t have to get caught here, but
the breakup of a relationship is a good opportu-
nity to go back and do some psychological
archeology and dig up those buried skeletons
that Mom and Pop helped create. This isn’t
about changing your parents or even your atti-
tude toward them, but freeing yourself from the
need to repeat unproductive and negative past
patterns.
For more information on how your parents influ-
ence your dating behavior, see Chapter 4.

Accepting that things don’t last forever
Just because something doesn’t last forever doesn’t mean it’s not good. A
smile on the street as you pass is a good relationship. A cheerful person who
bags your groceries is a relationship. Unfortunately, many people have the
sense that if something doesn’t last as long as they wanted or expected it to,
somebody must be blamed, someone has to pay, and it wasn’t a good rela-
tionship at all. (If you haven’t gotten the idea here that it takes a while to get
to know someone and even perfectly nice people can find that there just isn’t
that much cooking between the two of them after some time passes, then you
haven’t been paying much attention.)
If a relationship that doesn’t go on forever doesn’t have to be bad or a failure,
then neither party has to be the bad guy or at fault. The only perspective by
which you can evaluate whether the relationship made any sense or was a
good or not-so-good investment of your time is with time. And time takes time.
If you think of every experience as being tuition in the school of life and love,
then you can understand that some tuition is higher than others, and some
classes are more fun or stick with you longer or teach you more than others.
But it’s only after time passes that you gain the perspective to see which
things you really benefited from.
Always looking forward
It is humanly impossible to go backward in a relationship. Once you know
that someone can be both kind and smart, you’ll never settle for one without
the other again. Therefore, every breakup is an opportunity to go forward,
and after a while, you may even be able to say thank you to the one who gave
you your walking papers, even though it felt awful at the time.

A wise woman’s words
At one point in my life, I was involved in one of
those situations that was fraught — and I do
mean fraught — with lots and lots of misery. I
can remember confiding to my grandmother,
whom I loved dearly and with whom I shared
secrets, that the relationship really wasn’t going
very well at all and that when he wasn’t around,
I felt a part of me was missing.
She said, “Oh honey, that’s wonderful.”
“Wonderful?” I said. “Gram, whose side are
you on?”
She said, “Darlin’, people live their whole lives
without feeling that passion. Be glad that you’ve
had it.”
Even after all these years, my head understands
exactly what she meant, even though my heart
still has a bruise with his initials on it.

If you feel someone has done you wrong, it’s pretty hard to have the perspec-
tive that someday you’ll thank them for this, even though that line comes up
in movies a lot. One of the reasons it comes up so often is that it’s basically
true. You are the product of all of your experiences, good and not-so-good,
and sometimes it’s hard to tell the one from the other without a scorecard,
20/20 hindsight, and some time.
Scrutinizing the details
I’ve said it a gazillion times before, and I’m sure I’ll say it at least that many
more: God, genius, and salvation are in the details. If you can pare things
down to basics, you can problem-solve, and if you can problem-solve, you
can free yourself from the need to blame and hurt yourself or someone else.
If you can give up the need to be right or be martyred and just think things
through, you’ll know exactly what to do next. You may not like it, but you’ll
know, and in that knowledge is salvation and serenity.
Spending time alone
Time is a great healer. The nerve endings get anesthetized, and the pain
becomes a memory. (Fortunately, human beings have very little capacity to
remember pain, which isn’t to say that vengeance isn’t a real human emo-
tion.) So take the time you need.
Don’t immediately begin another relationship. Rebounding feels logical, but it’s
really not (see Chapter 24 for details). It’s only a way to postpone dealing with
the issues you have to deal with if you want to be a happy, healthy person.
Sidestepping emotional pitfalls
It’s certainly okay and appropriate to ask yourself whether you can live with
your decision over time. But be aware of the emotional seductions that are
part and parcel of this experience; they go directly for the gut or the jugular
and completely ignore that grown-up, smart part of you.
Our song
Music is as old as human history and is part of each of our personal his-
tories. Lullabies your mom sang you; the first time you heard the “Star
Spangled Banner” or “Yesterday” or “Heaven Help Us” or “Feelings”; singing
“The Itsy-Bitsy Spider” in kindergarten, hymns in Sunday school, and fight
songs at football games; the first musical you saw; and so on. If the two of
you were together more than ten minutes, you probably have a song that is
287
Chapter 23: Breaking Up

linked to your first date, kiss, fight, and make up. It is wise to avoid this
song when you’re alone for at least a year. You will not believe how quickly
you can be reduced to quivering jelly upon the opening chords. If you want
to get back together, fine, but do it for reasons other than musical ones.
Think about why you broke up and whether anything has changed or is
likely to, but don’t put yourself back in a dicey situation based on a ditty.
Our place
Memories can certainly be evoked by going to that special restaurant or
beach or woods or park bench. Hopefully, the masochistic part of you is
under enough control not to be seduced by revisiting your past before it is
really past, and you’re certainly smart enough not to try and take anybody
new there. If you find yourself back in an old haunt, at least try a different
table, order something outrageous, or fake an attack of poison ivy. You’ll
know that the relationship is truly in the past when you can revisit without
nostalgia or nausea, but don’t try the test too soon.
Being friends
Inevitably the person who was the dumper says, “I love you — I’m just not in
love with you. Let’s be friends.” The dumpee, grasping at straws, is tempted
to accept the morsel, hoping it will morph back into love — note to dumpee:
don’t be tempted. The only way to go from dumping to friendship is with
time, a lot of time, so that kindness won’t be misinterpreted as interest,
sexual feelings can be neutralized, and longing can dissipate. Time (I’m talk-
ing at least six months, more likely a year or more) allows for a perspective
on whether you even like each other. In many ways, liking is much harder
than loving since we do one primarily with our head, the other with our
heart, and hearts are more easily fooled!
Pity parties
This little experience is mentioned throughout this book because it is one of
the most common social (or antisocial) experiences on human calendars. We,
as a species, have an enormous capacity to feel sorry for ourselves and
indulge in lavish celebration of our misery. I am all in favor of 24 to 36 hours’
worth of misery after a breakup. If you wallow in self-pity for a day or two,
pulling out all the stops, visiting the old haunts, listening to your song, look-
ing at the pictures, stubbornly reviewing all the good times and great things,
and assuring yourself there will never ever be another love like this for you,
you will likely get bored and then you can begin healing.
But don’t invite other people to your party because they will get bored
sooner, and you might still have some residual pity left that can ooze out for
months and months. Other invitees might also divert attention to their own
misery, and misery doesn’t love company or competition. Worst-case sce-
nario, your friend may want to talk you out of your pity, which simply won’t
do at all.
288
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Have a pity party and get it out of your system so that you can escape the
gooey quagmire of self-indulgence and get a perspective and get on with your
life. If you find your party going on for more than two days, or you can’t stop
crying or obsessing, it’s time to get some help.
Stalking
You may have a tendency to see how your partner is doing without you.
Especially if you feel that your ex is seeing someone. There is a wish to spy
and keep an eye on what you may have viewed as yours (which is a problem
that needs to be addressed before you try and move on to another relation-
ship). But these actions can be characterized as stalking, and stalking is both
dangerous and illegal (see Chapter 27 for more on stalking behavior).
Possessiveness and jealousy are poisons that must be lanced and exorcised if
you are ever to have a sane, happy, serene relationship. If it’s over, it’s over,
and spying on someone is demeaning and dangerous and destructive. If the
relationship couldn’t work, it didn’t work between the two of you; whatever
else is outside of the two of you and therefore can’t be affected by you. Making
someone feel afraid is a statement of your need to be in control, to punish, or
to hurt. It’s not nice, and it’s not legal. So don’t sit outside their house, follow
them, call them at work, ask friends about them, or call and hang up.
Phone companies offer a caller ID feature, which tells you who’s calling and
documents who and when and how often someone calls. Harassment is illegal
as well as irritating, and who wants to end up in jail where you aren’t allowed
to call anyone without permission? Letting go is almost as hard as breaking
up, but it’s necessary, and police involvement isn’t going to make your life
easier or more pleasant.

Chapter 23: Breaking Up
Rats and relationships
At one point in my career as a psychologist, I
actually had to run rats through a maze. The
reason to run rats (yech) is to study learning
theory. You place a piece of cheese in the maze
and wait until the rat consistently goes to the
cheese. Learning theory begins when you move
the cheese and figure out how long it takes the
rat to relearn the maze. For a while, the rat will
continue to go to the place it went before, look-
ing for the reward. After a while, depending on
how smart the rat is, it will begin to look else-
where, finally discover the cheese, and then go
there consistently.
Human beings, on the other hand, won’t try to
relearn the maze because they are convinced
they are right, even though there is no cheese.
In relationships, you can either be right or you
can go for the cheese. I would heartily recom-
mend going for the cheese.

Violence
I hesitate to even mention this because it is so distasteful. Understand that it
is not unusual to feel angry and want to lash out when you’re hurt. You just
can’t do it. Being violent is both dangerous and illegal. If you’re feeling partic-
ularly nasty, write a poison pen letter but don’t send it. Write a story of death
and dismemberment and send it to a magazine to publish (lots of best-selling
authors have gotten revenge and rich simultaneously with this technique),
draw a picture, dream of destruction, dump on your diary. But stay away
from your ex and guns, baseball bats, arrows, pills, and razors.
Violence toward your ex or toward yourself isn’t a way to solve your
heartache. It will compound your misery and keep pain alive for much longer
than necessary. If you feel you can’t control the impulse to damage yourself
or someone else, get yourself to a therapist or, if need be, a hospital, and take
yourself out of harm’s way.
Trust me, everyone has had these feelings. It’s just a matter of controlling
them or controlling yourself, and if you can’t, put yourself in a position (like
a hospital) where you don’t have to control them because someone else is in
charge. The anger and hurt do pass, and most people learn to control their
negative impulses so that they don’t have to be afraid or make others afraid
of them. They learn to love and feel close and trust. In the final analysis,
that’s what Dating For Dummies and life as we know it are all about. Take a
deep breath and relax and understand that coming together and coming
apart is the dance people do until they find the right partner.

In This Chapter

 Giving a potential partner time to heal
I
absolutely guarantee you’re going to hate this chapter, but I also absolutely
guarantee that if you understand it and can discipline yourself enough to
heed the dire warnings and stay clear of big league emotional involvement that
I detail here, you can save yourself some serious wear and tear on your head,
your heart, your soul, and your psyche. (If nothing else, think of all the cool
ways you can spend the money you would have otherwise spent on therapy or
a good lawyer to get yourself out of the results of not paying attention to the
rebound rules.)
When I say rebound, I’m not talking about Shaquille O’Neal and the skill it takes
to dunk someone else’s shot amid fierce opposition. I’m talking about a much
more dangerous sport that involves catching yourself or someone else on the
bounce from another relationship whose momentum hasn’t stopped enough
for the person in question to come to rest after the tumult of a breakup.
Rebound is easiest to understand when looking at someone else’s behavior
and hardest to apply to oneself because the end of a dating situation, espe-
cially if it’s gone on for more than a month or two, hurts; it’s natural to want
to get some relief from that pain. Unfortunately, time is crucial, especially if
that time is spent in active recovery, trying to figure out what happened, why
it happened, how it happened, and what you can do about it next time. (Note:
Asking someone else or the universe “why” is a waste of time, but asking
yourself why you behaved a certain way is always time well spent.)
In this chapter, I discuss several aspects of rebounding, including how to
recover from a breakup and what to do while you’re healing from the end of
a relationship. I also warn you about the dangers of dating newly divorced
or married people.

Loosening the Ties That Bind
People get involved and enmeshed with one another. No news flash. We smile
at someone we see every day on the way to work. We say, “Hi,” to a neighbor
who lives down the block. We chat with someone in our aerobics class. But
once we’ve dated a person, we’re into the foothills and heading toward the
Mt. Everest of human interaction; the involvement and entanglement are that
much greater.
We’re humans, not robots. The feelings we invest can’t be unplugged or
turned off like a faucet. When you see someone you like, you put out a fragile,
wispy tendril. If the person shows interest, they too put out a thread, and so
it goes. The longer the involvement, the deeper the commitment, the more
levels on which there is communication and caring and interaction, and the
greater the number and the stronger the ties.
When a relationship starts to break down, the result is often more tendrils
rather than less. The reason is that you up the energy because fear and anxi-
ety increase the strength and intensity of the threads in an attempt to bring
the other person closer, pretend that everything’s okay in order to try and
return to the good old days, or continue the illusion that you are cared for
and adored even with evidence to the contrary.
When enough is enough and one or the other of you calls the whole thing off,
those tendrils aren’t like retractable cords on a vacuum cleaner that quickly
whip back into the socket. There is no instant shut-off valve. Even when the
two of you don’t see each other, the heart, the brain, and the mind remember.
You can be haunted in your dreams, your memories, your fantasies. And each
of those remembrances has tendrils. Because these tendrils are not based in
reality, often they are particularly stubborn and hard to get rid of.
If you’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, there aren’t going to be gobs
of connections between the two of you. If you’ve been going out for months,
it’s going to be harder to pull away because of the increased number and
strength of those ties; even the thought of severing them may seem really
painful. Sometimes rather than begin the painful procedure of pulling away,
couples just let things drag on in the futile hope that things will either improve
and there will be no need to break off or things will get worse and it will be
easier to walk away. But anybody who’s attempted this Cleopatra technique
(Queen of Denial . . . get it?) can tell you how ineffective it is. The idea that it’s
easier to leave something if it gets worse overlooks the fact that staying in a
lousy relationship takes time and energy and that even diseased tendrils are
tendrils and can be amazingly tenuous. (People can convince themselves to
stay and nurse a nasty relationship rather than admit the problems and either
make things better or get out because sometimes it feels easier to ignore prob-
lems than to solve them.)
292
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

Connection is connection. If the tendril thing doesn’t work for you, try another
analogy or metaphor. Two people in a relationship become intertwined, like
two saplings that are planted in the same pot, which is one of the reasons why
it’s hard to leave a situation that was once good: Uncoupling is truly the pits.
As each tree grows, its limbs and roots become tangled around the other. Even
if one of the trees dies or is cut down, the other tree’s shape has been changed
forever, and unless the tree wants to die as well (don’t even think about it),
it will take time and soil and sunshine for the remaining tree to regain its
strength, to be straight, and to find the sunshine on its own. The ending of the
best relationships leaves us a bit shaken but able to function on our own even-
tually, to find the light and the soil we need to grow, and to not have to worry
about sharing nutrients or water or shade or space or sun with another until
we’re sure we can survive.
People are resilient and crave intimacy and involvement, but any dating situa-
tion works best when two little saplings choose to be together rather than
have to be together to survive. When a dating situation works, the strength
of both contributes to a greater strength as a couple, but uncoupling is truly
the pits.
Defining Rebound
Rebound isn’t slam-dunking a ball. It is feeling like you’ve been slam-dunked or
even that you’ve slam-dunked someone else and aren’t real proud of yourself
about it. Either way, you’re going to feel wounded or guilty, and asking another
person to tell you that you’re okay is too much of a burden for another soul
and too needy on your part.
Rebound is one of those useful words that says exactly what it is: It is a
recoiling — yeah, like a gun — a springing back from a disappointment.
Those of you who are physicists know that for every action, there is an equal
and opposite reaction. The greater the pain, the bigger the bounce. You don’t
want to catch somebody when they’re still bouncing around because who
knows where they will land. For the same reason, it’s important to resist the
temptation to use someone to slow your own flight. People get hurt and
bruised and feel used when used as a backstop.
How then do you regain equilibrium after a disappointment? You allow yourself
to bounce around a bit without getting other people involved in the motion.
You’re dangerous to yourself and to them. Just allow the motion to continue
until it’s stopped, and then wait a little longer until you’re absolutely, positively
certain there haven’t been even teensy, tiny bounces for a couple of months.
293
Chapter 24: Rebound

Bounces are really tricky and deceptive. Our head stops bouncing well before
our heart does. Even if you’re convinced the breakup was for the best and
both of you will be better off, the sense of being a bit woozy, a tad shell
shocked, less than your most stable self takes a bit of time to get over.
Everybody wonders deep down if the breakup is really their fault, if they are
completely unlovable or capable of loving. The simplest short-term solution
is to go find an emotional Band-Aid quickly so that you can put those panicky
feelings aside. Don’t do it. Having somebody waiting in the wings is a short-
term solution to a long-term problem. If you’ve catapulted yourself into a
brand-new relationship, where is the time or energy to figure out what went
wrong in the old relationship going to come from? If you take the time from
the new relationship to figure out the old relationship, your new love will be
understandably miffed; if you don’t take time, you increase the probability
that you’ll do the same thing again. If it happens over and over, you’re going
to be one unhappy or unfeeling cookie.
Beware the bounce. Take the time to let the motion stop before the emotions
start again.
Using the Time Productively
What now? I won’t let you date, so are you supposed to become a hermit?
Nah, that just makes you vulnerable, and you lose all that hard-won poise.
Time is really the only cure for healing emotional bruises, and the healing
can’t go on if you’re busily diverting yourself with growing new tendrils and
sending them out. If you don’t take time to heal, those tendrils will be super
sensitive, not very healthy, and very, very needy — not an auspicious begin-
ning, and beginnings are hard enough as it is.
The first rule is to stay away from romance. How can you convince your
heart and your bruised ego to avoid flirting back or using that soft or strong
shoulder of that person you sorta had your eye on to cry on? Stop it — and
divert yourself. Here are some suggestions on how to use the rebound in a
productive rather than destructive way:
 Work on same-sex friendships. Friends are those people who sustain us
through breakups and traumas and share our good times. I’m sure
you’re sensible enough to not ignore or neglect your friends when you’re
in a love relationship, but now is a terrific time to really work on and
polish the part of you that is a terrific friend.
 Shift through the ashes of the old relationship. This is the time to
become an emotional archeologist. No one is completely to blame when
294
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

a relationship tanks, so get out that trusty paper and pencil and see
what you can learn. This exercise isn’t much fun, but it’s truly time well
spent. If nothing else, it should absorb enough time and energy tem-
porarily to put you off dating until you’ve figured out what to do next
time to avoid the bruises.
 Stay away from one-on-one. That well-meaning buddy can easily turn
into a wrongheaded fling if you’re not careful, and what an icky thing to
do to a friend. There is strength and safety in numbers. Hang out with
friends, large groups, small countries.
 Work out. This is a good time to join a gym or a softball team or play
some b-ball at the local high school. Take tennis lessons (avoid the cute
pro) or learn to swim. Keeping physically active helps cure the blues
and the blahs, and once you’re ready to get back in the swing, you’ll look
fabbo.
 Paint your house, clean out your closets, trim the hedges. Taking care
of those chores you never have time to do when you’re involved will
make your living environment that much more pleasant and give you a
real sense of accomplishment. Planting a community garden, cleaning up
a park, or helping construct a home for Habitat for Humanity also gets
you being physical and social with a specific goal in mind without pair-
ing off or staying alone.
 Become a workaholic, temporarily. In the flush of a new dating situa-
tion or one that is going poorly, work often suffers. Now is a great time
to spend that available time at work, which allows you that much more
time and money to lavish on yourself once you begin dating again.
Taking the rebound time to work on yourself and your world pays gobs of
dividends: You’ll sleep better, look better, and act better (and the alternative
is really awful to contemplate). If you don’t give yourself time to get out from
under the shadow of your bruises, you’re going to go postal (overreact and
blow everyone away) or batmobile (put up impenetrable shields that will
deflect any potential incoming hazard). For example, if your old date was
always late, the first time your new date is three minutes late, you’re going to
be convinced that you’re the last polite person left on the planet and start
ranting and raving. Very nice, right? Wrong! — and so much fun to be around.
Not exactly the frame of mind conducive to getting to know someone and let-
ting them get to know you, which is the only purpose of dating.
The person on the rebound either clings for dear life or begins to run through
dates like Kleenex tissues on the assumption that there is either something
wrong with everyone else or something desperately wrong with them.
Disposable or cement — not a nice choice.
295
Chapter 24: Rebound

Waiting It Out
Please, please, please do yourself a favor and give yourself enough time to
recover. How long does the process take, you ask? Some who are stricter than
I am think you need to wait one month for every two you’ve been involved. I
think formulas are a bit rigid here.
A good rule of thumb is to double or triple the time you think it will take, and
no fair cheating. The basic idea is to wait until you can think about the ex
without pain or embarrassment or sadness, and you can avoid talking about
them. There is nothing more tedious than having to listen to your date’s
recitation about why their ex was terrific or terrible. If you still need to talk,
find a therapist, not a date.
The longer you dated, the longer the recovery period. If you talked about the
L word (love, not lust) or even the M word (marriage — don’t you dare break
out in hives), or you dated for more than six months, the ratio gets closer to
one-to-one — it will take as long to get over it as it did to get into it. Sad, but
true (it’s the tendril thing). If you were talking about the M or the L word, and
the relationship had been less than six months, you were rushing things and
that may be part of your problem. It takes six to nine months to get to know
anybody.
If you dated for over a year, the waiting period is at least a year. One whole
calendar sequence so that you know you can make it through your birthday,
Christmas, New Year’s, Thanksgiving, the Fourth of July, Easter, Passover, the

Projects under construction
I was walking down the street beside a building
that was being rehabbed. As I stopped at the
light, the foreman came over, took my arm, and
said, “Projects under construction are danger-
ous. Things can fly off and hit you. Why do you
think we’re wearing hard hats? Anytime you see
a project under construction or rehab, cross the
street. It’s dangerous.”
I think his advice works for situations that aren’t
new buildings in the literal sense. Any dating sit-
uation is an attempt to build something on a firm
foundation. If it feels dangerous, you’ll end up
wearing a hard hat for your heart. If one of the
pillars of the relationship (you or your date) is on
the rebound — the person is unstable and
trying to rebuild their own life — walk away until
the rehab is done, and there’s time and energy
to work on your new project together.
Remember, lives under construction are unsta-
ble and therefore dangerous foundations on
which to build a new structure.

ex’s birthday, the anniversary of your first date, the anniversary of your first
kiss, and so on. Once you know you can do it by yourself, any future relation-
ship will be based on choice, not need, and that’s a much healthier beginning.
Dependency offers a really useful short-term basis for a relationship, but it
simply doesn’t work for the long run. Any good relationship nurtures, and in
a nurturing relationship, the dependent one becomes less needy. This leaves
the powerful person in the position of feeling useless or trying to make the
other person still need them, and the best way to make someone needy is to
belittle them. In psychology, the tendency to use power to make someone
dependent is called the Bad Mother Syndrome: You’re a bad, ugly, nasty child,
and no one will love you but me, so you had better never leave me. It’s bad
mothering, and it’s lousy relating.
The need to go back to the good old, needy days is destructive and danger-
ous, like ouch.
If the person you’re thinking of dating has been married or you’ve been mar-
ried, the rules get even stricter. The waiting period is one whole year after the
divorce has become final. This is such a crucial and important point, I’m going
to say it again: WAIT ONE FULL YEAR AFTER THE DIVORCE HAS BECOME
FINAL! No exceptions.

Advice for the friend of a friend
One day on the street, I ran into a friend who
introduced me to his friend who was just
divorced. My friend explained who I was, and I
explained that I was writing this book. The guy,
without taking a breath, launched into a feverish
account of his date last night. He had mentioned
that he wouldn’t buy an apartment until he found
the right woman, and he’d want her to help him
pick it out to make sure that it was big enough to
have kids (this was a first date). Fifteen minutes
later she said, “I really don’t want to have kids.”
He was offended, couldn’t understand why she
was making such a big deal of it, and then he
immediately said, “My ex-wife always. . . .”
I said, “How long have you been divorced?”
“Three months,” he said.
I said, “You ought not to be dating at all right
now.”
He said, “You don’t know my situation; there
was no emotional. . . .”
I interrupted, “I know everyone’s situation.”
“I’m different,” he said.
Yeah right. This guy could be the rebound poster
boy. He’s an accident actively seeking a place
to happen. He thinks a woman being honest
when she hears something that doesn’t suit her
is overreacting. I told him to buy the book.

Everybody universally hates my one-year rule, but instead of viewing it as a
prohibition issued by the Wicked Witch of the East (cute lil ol’ me), what if
you view it as a gift to yourself: a gift where for a whole year you don’t have
to be altruistic, thoughtful, generous, or compromising. You can do exactly
what you want to do, when you want to do it, how you want to do it, without
explaining it to anybody. What a gift! That way, you can get it all out of your
system, and you understand a lot more of who you are and when it’s time to
start dating. Then when that year is over and you start dating again, the idea
of compromise or doing it someone else’s way is going to feel like a novelty
and a pleasure as opposed to a burden. So please give yourself the gift of the
one-year rule.
Avoiding the Still Married, Separated,
and Newly Divorced
Assume that you’ve taken all my warnings to heart and you’ve waited the
appropriate period of time. One of your friends at the office tells you his ex-
sister-in-law has just moved to town and thinks the two of you will be terrific
together. Your first question is not “How old is she?” or “Can I see a picture?”
or “Does she have kids?” It’s “How long has she been divorced?”
The only people who are eligible for sane dating situations are people whose
divorce has been final for at least one year. You know how crucial that wait-
ing time was for you, and you can do the world, your potential date, and
yourself an enormous favor by immediately asking the question, “How long
has the divorce been final?”
The following words and phrases are all fancy or not-so-fancy ways of saying,
“Still married”:
 Separated
 Staying together for the sake of the kids
 Living like brother and sister
 Waiting for her mother, brother, aunt, or dog to die
 Can’t afford to live separately right now
 In the hands of the lawyers
 Have almost everything worked out
 Working on an annulment
298
Part VI: The Day After and Beyond 

 Only until I find another job, apartment, or reason to live
 I’m not sure if I’m straight
Don’t date married people, and if you’re married, don’t date. Married people
who date are unhappy, dishonest, and confused, or they’re people who use
other people. Who needs to be in that kind of situation? And even if you’re
tempted, maybe I can convince you not to if you realize that
 You will be alone every Christmas, New Year’s, weekend, and holiday.
 Married people who date lie. If this person really does get divorced, they
either need recovery time, or they are the kind who will cheat on you
since the pattern has already been established.
 You’ll be viewed either as someone who cheats (if you’re the married
one) or as someone who has so few scruples that you’d date someone
else’s spouse.
Who needs to date someone who is already proven to be capable of adultery,
bad judgment, or both? Who needs the heartache? Walking into a propeller is
just plain dumb, and dating someone who’s still married is walking into a pro-
peller. Even if that someone hasn’t been living with his or her not-really ex,
what makes you think the person doesn’t use his or her legal purgatory as a
way to keep potential dates or mates at arms’ length? You truly can’t win. You
can only lose.
The proper response to finding out that your prospective date has not been
divorced the required one year is, “I’ve read (or I know) how crazy that first
year is. I think you’re special enough to wait for because I think we might
really have something here. I’ll call you in (fill in the blank) months, and we
can celebrate the anniversary of your divorce together.”
Anniversaries of separations are not to be celebrated. If you’re feeling like
you really want to be the emotional Red Cross, go take a cold shower. Once
you’ve dried off, donate some time to a worthy cause, but not to a walking
disaster area that is a person freshly out of a relationship. I promise you will
be an emotional Band-Aid, and we all know what happens to used Band-Aids.
You deserve better.
You don’t have to walk away forever, but you do have to walk away. Everybody
needs to regain his or her equilibrium after being on storm-tossed seas.
Whether the boat sank or floundered on the rocks or was commandeered by
pirates, get your breath and your sea legs back. Give yourself some time. It will
be time well spent even though it’s hard to do.

Playing It Safe and
Keeping It Fresh

In this part . . .
R
emember when your mom and dad taught you to
look both ways before crossing the street? It’s not
that they wanted you to fearfully cling to the crossing
guard, but they wanted you to land safely on the other
side. That’s what I want for you, too. I want you to be
adventurous, open to meeting new people, trusting — but
careful. I want you to keep your eyes wide open so you
can see what’s coming down the road. In this part, you’ll
learn how to date smart. Without scaring yourself silly or
putting yourself under house arrest, you’ll find out how to
have fun without being foolish and how to take risks with-
out engaging in risky behavior.

Chapter 25
Safety First
In This Chapter
 Letting someone know where you’re going
 Finding out your date’s full name and address
 Getting to the date location
 Tucking $20 in your shoe
 Meeting in a public place
 Following your intuition
D
ating can be scary and fun and exciting and challenging, but you want it
to be all of the above for all the right reasons — not because you haven’t
taken reasonable precautions about your own safety. Crossing a street is per-
fectly valid and the only way to get to the other side; it’s safe, too, if you’re wise
enough to look both ways before you venture forth. This chapter is about look-
ing both ways, not under the pavement or being so terrified of traffic you need
to hold someone’s hand as you cross. Just looking both ways.
If you’ve been frightened by the unprecedented number of stalking and dating
victims, don’t become a hermit or assume that dating is a high-risk behavior.
Just take the issue of safety seriously at the beginning. Never give out your
home phone number. Don’t tell strangers where you live or work. Use your
cell phone. If somebody is calling you a lot or you’re getting a lot of hang-ups,
or if somebody is trying to cut you off from your family and friends and tells
you that they’ve never loved anybody like you and they can’t live without you,
do not be flattered by this; be terrified by this. This is stalking behavior.
News stories always focus on Jack the Ripper — or a modern-day monster —
who preys primarily on women. But guys, it makes sense for you to be a bit
cautious, too. (Please tell me you look both ways before crossing . . . macho
doesn’t keep you safe from Mack trucks, fella.) Don’t feel you can skip this

chapter or skim through it. You’ll feel better and safer if you’ve been sensible,
too. Besides, it’s good to know what your date may have on her mind other
than batting her baby blues at you.
Telling Somebody Where You’re Going
Always let someone you trust know where you’re going when you go out —
and with whom. Unless you went to kindergarten with your date and every
grade since, it makes sense to let someone know where you are, especially
these days, when people meet through the personals and blind dates and
online chat rooms. Even if you’re both safe from each other, what if the car
breaks down or there’s a storm at the beach or your roller blades are
hijacked? Not only is it smart to be safe rather than sorry, you’ll feel more
relaxed as well.
If your mom or your big brother is likely to grill you about your date for
weeks afterward, pick someone else to tell — a friend who gives you the
same kind of info. If you don’t know a soul, the next best thing is to leave a
detailed note of where you are and who you’re with posted in an obvious
spot in your home or apartment, such as on the refrigerator door. It just
makes common sense. If you should stumble into trouble, speed and accu-
racy are essential.
Particularly if you’re a single woman living alone, tell a friend what you’re up
to. While it may feel like a pinch on your freedom, it’s a gift you and your
single girlfriends can give to each other.

Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 
It was a dark and stormy night . . .
I was once on my way to a speaking engage-
ment and missed my connecting flight due to
bad weather. Having no other choice, I hired a
car to take me the 200 miles I needed to go. The
driver did nothing to make me feel comfortable
by asking me if I wanted to sit up front and
telling me about his 12-step recovery. After we
had gone 300 miles or so, I realized he was
hopelessly lost. There were no lights and no
cars and no signs. It also occurred to me that he
knew I had the cash to pay him because we’d
discussed it ahead of time. In my most tactful
voice, I soothingly asked if I could find a phone
and reconfirm to my hosts, whom I had told
about his car.
This was, of course, untrue. But to this day, I’m
convinced that the knowledge that someone
knew where I was and with whom saved me
from getting dismembered by the roadside. I
only wish I’d had enough sense to make
the phone call I fantasized. Be smarter than I
was — but have since learned to be.

Getting Your Date’s Name, 
Rank, and Serial Number
While researching this book, I asked several single friends, both male and
female, to tell me how often they knew the home address of a first date who
was picking them up or meeting them somewhere. The answer I most often
heard was “rarely,” which stunned me at first. Then, the more I thought about
it, the more I realized it was logical — though not terribly sensible. Most first-
date arrangements these days sound something like this:
“You want to get together sometime?”
“Yeah. Sounds great.”
“Great! Can I call you?”
“Sure. Here’s my office number, my fax, my e-mail address, my beeper
number, and my cell phone number.”
“I’ll give you a buzz.”
When he or she does call, a specific home address simply doesn’t come up in
conversation unless it’s needed for directions.
That’s what I’d like you to change. During your rundown of numbers and let-
ters and e-mail addresses, I’d like you to ask one simple question: Where do
you live?
Your date-to-be may or may not want to give an exact address — which is
okay — but if someone is reluctant to give any clues, you may want to ask
why. And while you’re at it, make sure you know your date’s last name (and
how to spell it).
If he or she is hesitant to freely offer any of this information, consider it a red
flag because there are precious few reasons for not making a full disclosure:
 The person is married.
 The person lives with his or her mother.
 The person is embarrassed by his or her neighborhood.
 The person lives in a car.
305
Chapter 25: Safety First

Getting There Can Be Fun
Depending on the part of the country in which you live and your age and eco-
nomic situation, your date may offer to pick you up in a cab, a limo, a scooter, a
wagon, a bus, or not at all. Although a car, especially if it’s yours or your dad’s
or your older sib’s or your granny’s, may sound fun, and there’s something
lovely and promlike about the ritual of leaving your home on a first date and
walking together to the car (will he hold the door open? will she unlock the
inside?), I want you to consider other safer and potentially saner alternatives.
Meeting there
Meeting there is a good option for several reasons:
 You are in control of your arrival and departure times. There’s no nail-
biting if your date’s late, or frantic rushing around if they’re early. And,
if the date turns out to be a dud, you’re outta there in seconds flat.
 Realistically, you may not be so comfortable giving a near-stranger your
address just yet. That’s okay. If he or she insists on coming to your
house, that’s another red flag right there. (But remember, you already
worked out the address deal; see the earlier section “Getting Your Date’s
Name, Rank, and Serial Number.”)
 You don’t have to count on your date staying sober when you drive your
own car. You do, however, have to make sure you don’t drink (unless
you’ve been dropped off by a friend, parent, cab, bus, or so on).
 Unless you invite your date to follow you home at the end of the evening,
the sex question is definitely out of the question.
 Meeting at the location lends a slightly businesslike air to the date —
which can be ideal for a first meeting where you’re still checking each
other out.
Meeting at the office, workplace, or school
After-work or school dates have advantages as well as a couple of pitfalls:
 Unless you work in a one-man operation, you’re meeting in a public
place and can keep your private home address to yourself for now.
306
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

 Presumably your co-workers will still be around. It’s a great opportunity
to see how well your date relates to others.
 You can still exercise the option to provide your own transportation
from work — you can leave your car there and call a cab from the
restaurant or theater.
 One disadvantage is that it ups the pressure for your date to offer to
escort you home if you haven’t left a car at your meeting place.
 Now your date knows where to find you eight hours a day. At home, at
least you can leave the machine on or change your phone number if the
situation gets too dicey (for instance, your date won’t take no for an
answer). In some working environments — a store, restaurant, driving
a city bus — it can be much harder to avoid a too-ardent admirer.
 The major disadvantage of meeting at work — blowing your cover —
can be offset by meeting somewhere near work.
Meeting in your ’hood
Your neighborhood is your territory. It’s where you feel comfy and known.
Meeting at some nearby landmark — the fountain in town, the gas station,
the Piggly Wiggly (I could have said grocery store, but my childhood res-
onates when I mention the Piggly Wiggly — a real grocery in Colorado and
the West) — has several advantages. It’s public and close to home, and
chances are, you’ll be seen by neighbors who care about you.
307
Chapter 25: Safety First
Mom versus my favorite restaurant
I took my mom to one of my favorite restaurants
when she came to visit. She asked me if I ever
took dates there. I said, as a matter of fact, I
often did because it was close to home, all the
guys there knew me, and I felt safe. Mom said,
“Bad idea. They treat you like a princess here.
It’ll scare the poor guy to death.” I told a friend
this story, and she said, “Mom’s wrong. It’s the
perfect place. They might as well start treating
you like a princess from the get-go.”
The moral of this story is, it’s good to feel comfy
as long as you don’t make your date feel too
uncomfy. If there are either emotional or verbal
references to dates past, I might forgo the expe-
rience for a while.

Taking Cash
Always make sure you have what my mom calls “mad money.” It’s enough
cash to get yourself home should you decide to walk away in a huff. Tuck
20 bucks inside your shoe. Just remember to take it out at the end of the
evening or you’ll have a closet full of cash.
Achieving Safety in Numbers
My number one criteria for a safe date is to meet in a public place. When you
do, you’re creating your own safety zone. Essential for not only feeling relaxed
emotionally, but for releasing your body from guard duty as well. Your shoul-
ders drop, your eyes stop darting left and right, your breathing deepens and
slows. Isolated, dark, quiet places may be great for romance, but on a first
date, the goal is to get comfortable with each other. And comfort comes with
safety. And safety comes in well-trafficked public places where you can let
your guard down.
Here’s a list of safe things to do on a first date (go to Chapter 10 for more
information on great date locations):
308
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 
Safest
Outdoor concert
Rollerblading in the
park on Saturday
Going for ice cream
Doing lunch
Doing brunch
Meeting for coffee
Going dancing
5K run in the park
Museum
Less Safe
Meeting at a bar
A private party
(unless you know
the party-givers)
Seeing a drive-in movie
Sporting event (testos-
terone levels can go
sky-high if it’s a violent
sport)
Unsafe
Going for a drive
Midnight walk on the
beach
Weekend in the country
His or her home alone
A hike in the woods
Times Square: New
Year’s Eve after 
midnight
Again, this list is not intended to scare you into joining a monastic order.
Certainly, a midnight stroll on the beach can blossom into one of the most
memorable dates of your life, but a midnight stroll doesn’t have to be a first
date. Mom was right: It is better to be safe than sorry. In the dating world,
avoiding iffy situations in the first place is better than trying to figure out
how to get out alive and intact. This is dating, not undercover work.

Paying Attention to Your Intuition
You know that old chestnut, “If it seems too good to be true, it probably is”?
Well, I want you to memorize a slightly different version: “If it feels all wrong
to you, it probably is.”
In fact, if you ever feel the niggling of intuition telling you that something’s
not quite right, do this:
1. Listen to your gut.
2. Do a reality check.
3. Get out and sort through your intuition later.
Intuition is . . .
The word intuition comes from the Latin tuitionem, which means “guarding or
protecting.” Your natural intuition is a sort of sixth sense that allows you to
“feel” something you can’t see or touch or define. It’s a way of processing
information emotionally as well as intellectually that makes you feel every-
thing is okay — or not.
Intuition is also what bonds you wordlessly to a person you don’t know well. “I
just have a good feeling about them,” you say. You’re probably right. It doesn’t
take a rocket scientist to realize that the tingly feeling you have as you walk
through a deserted parking garage or the urge to walk on a well-lit street is sen-
sible and will keep you safer than ignoring your body’s warning signs.
Women’s intuition, a common notion in the American vernacular, is actually
true. Women do have a more finely tuned sixth sense than men. Perhaps it’s a
throwback from the Stone Age when women had to be hyper-alert not only
for their own safety but for their little cave babies, too.
Intuition versus paranoia
The trick is to distinguish between true intuition and the paranoia our soci-
ety so easily fuels with all the in-your-face crime images on TV and in the
papers. How do you do it? The best way is to start with trust. Trust your own
instincts first. Tap into how you really feel, in your gut. If those gut feelings
turn out to be wrong again and again, you’ll know your intuition needs a little
adjustment.
309
Chapter 25: Safety First

When I lived in Boston, I often took the shortcut through the Commons (a
large, manicured park in which the earlier citizens of Boston were — and still
are — allowed to graze two head of sheep or cattle) on my way home. If I ever
felt the least bit spooked, I went around rather than through. I never ques-
tioned my feelings or berated myself for being a baby. I also noticed that
when I carried my umbrella over my shoulder like a rifle, I was less likely to
be spooked. Body language says a lot.
It’s okay to get the heck out
Before your first date begins, I want you to make a conscious decision. If, at
any point, your date feels not quite right to you — if there’s a look that gives
you the willies or a remark that sends the hairs on the back of your neck
standing on end — immediately do the following:
1. Do a reality check. Flat out ask, “What did you mean by that?”
If your date shuffles his feet or she blushes scarlet, you’ll know it was
probably just a faux pas and not a sign of something more sinister.
2. Look at body language, and if your date’s body language makes you
uncomfortable, move yourself away.
Is your date standing in an aggressive manner (hands on hips, feet
planted, staring) or sitting too close? You’re entitled to feel absolutely
comfortable.
3. Survey your surroundings.
Are people around? Is the lighting sufficient? Does the location put you
on alert?
310
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 
If you don’t believe me, try this
If you view intuition as so much gobbledygook,
I encourage you to try this experiment the next
time you’re at a party. Stare at someone’s back
and see how long it takes them to turn around.
It’s even more potent if a number of you do the
focused staring. I think the longest it ever took
anybody to turn around was about 10 seconds,
and the average is right around four.

4. Listen to your own body.
Sometimes your body knows what your head may be denying. Listen
to your heartbeat. Is it a smooth, steady rhythm or a deep, resonant
pounding? Do you feel yourself running out of breath even though you’re
sitting still? Decide whether you’re excited because you’re turned on or
terrified. There is a difference even though the clues are quite similar.
5. Evaluate all the cues, listen to your gut, and, if you still feel uneasy,
get yourself out of there.
Plead illness, a headache — it’s okay to be a fraidy-cat. Dating is sup-
posed to be fun and exciting, not scary!

 Playing it safe with online love connections
 Using personal ads wisely
 Handling blind dates with the minimum of trouble
T
here are a lot of ways to meet people (in fact, I list about a zillion in
Chapter 6). You meet someone at a friend’s house; you catch someone’s
eye in class; you both volunteer at the same homeless shelter. You meet, you
talk, you make plans to get together.
When you get together online or through personal ads or through a blind
date, you’re really not meeting at all until the actual day of the date. While
you may have chatted, if you’ve never laid eyes on each other, you are com-
plete strangers. Believe it.
This chapter can allow you the freedom to indulge in this high-risk behavior
with a safety net when your first date is the first time you really meet face to
face. But please be really, extra, especially careful, and if you’re feeling the
least bit chancy, pass for a safer method of meeting someone.
Online Connections
Every week on my daily program, I receive at least one call from someone
who met someone online. I’m going to tell you what I always tell him or her:
This person you meet online, however familiar he or she may seem to you, is
a stranger. Repeat after me: a stranger. My callers always protest this, as I’m
sure you will, too, if you’ve met someone in the vast world of cyberspace.
Think about the circumstances realistically for a moment:

 Each of you is sitting in front of a computer screen, alone, in your home
or office.
 No one is speaking. You’re writing to each other. Although you feel like
you’re talking, online is an entirely different form of communication.
Many tongue-tied people are elegant, soulful writers.
 You have no way to verify that what he or she is telling you is true. You
may well be communicating with a fiction writer.
 Your intimacy appears more intense because all of your senses, sensors,
and censors are not engaged. Your online companion can (and will) tell
you things he or she would never tell you to your face — for better and
worse.
This type of false intimacy is misleading. You feel as though you know this
person better than you do. Even if he or she is completely honest, you have
only a partial picture. If you do decide to meet someone you’ve “met” online,
be very careful and follow these guidelines:
 Exchange recent photographs first. Not touched-up, Hollywood ver-
sions of yourself, but the real McCoy. The fewer surprises, the better.
 Meet in a public place. No exceptions . . . no matter how well you
“know” them.
 Schedule a short date that has a built-in end to it. Go to lunch on a
workday or meet for a quick cup of coffee.
If the initial meeting goes well, it’s still critical to proceed with extreme cau-
tion. After all, you’re partaking in a sort of “backward” relationship — one
that begins with intense revelations and pulls back from there. The potential
for heartbreak is magnified. If things don’t work out, you may feel as though
you’ve revealed your soul online and were rejected on the basis of how you
look. Devastating, indeed. Take it very, very slowly.
Personal Ads
As I discuss in Chapter 3, personal ads have become an acceptable way of,
at the very least, jazzing up your social life, providing that you are specific,
honest, and careful. Different from an ongoing online exchange, a personal
ad is literally an advertisement for yourself. It’s usually well thought-out in
advance — few people just dash out a personal ad. At the very least, a per-
sonal ad tells the reader what the “advertiser” wants in a date. At most, it
offers a real insight into the way the person who wrote it feels about himself
or herself and about others.
314
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

There’s nothing wrong with either placing or answering a personal ad. It’s a
good way to get very specific about who you are and what you want in a date.
And it can be a great way to get that all-important introduction to someone.
Once that happens, a natural unveiling of your fleshed-out personality can
take place. I know tons of happy couples who met in the personals and later
married. Of course, I know many other couples who did not. That said, there
are very specific ways to protect yourself when writing and responding to a
personal ad:
 Never include your full name, phone number, or address in the ad.
 Be honest. Why waste time, effort, and money misleading someone with
whom you want to develop a lasting relationship?
 Meet only in a public place, for a specified amount of time.
 Keep your expectations in check. Yours may be one of several ads your
date responded to.
 Exchange recent photographs ahead of time.
 Have fun. Remember . . . it’s only a date.
Blind Dates
One step up from a personal ad, a blind date can be either a godsend or the
last time you ever speak to the “friend” who set you up. Married people are
notorious for trying to fix up their single friends, with all the best of inten-
tions. If nothing else, a blind date is a crash course on what your friends
think you’d be interested in. Keep these rules in mind:
 Rule 1: Know the intent of the person who’s fixing you up. If your mom
wants you to meet her friend’s son who “doesn’t get out much,” ask
Mom whether she’s met the dude and whether going out with him is
likely to help or hurt her friendship if the two of you don’t hit it off. If
your best friend wants you to meet this great woman who just moved
into his building, ask yourself what your friend’s taste in women is like.
Are you willing to give it a try? Before you do, be sure to follow Rule 2.
 Rule 2: Get to know your blind date (at least a little) on the phone
first. You can save both of you some time and money by getting to know
each other a little first (see Rule 3 for the type of info you want to get).
Or you can drag the fixer-upper along on the first date. Having the fixer-
upper come along works really well because it takes both the anxiety
and the danger out of the situation. Worst-case scenario: You had fun
with at least one person.
315
Chapter 26: Dating Sight Unseen

If you’re the fixer, one of the coolest and least painful fix-up scenarios
occurs when you ask both of your candidates to go out with you. Not a
double date, just the three of you. If they seem to be getting along, you
can scram and get the good skinny later. If it seems like a disaster, hang
in there until one of them decides to leave.
 Rule 3: Conduct a pre-date “interview.” At minimum, this interview
covers the basics: Who? What? Where? and Are you married? It’s also one
way to feel more secure about somebody who someone else knows but
you don’t. In a friendly, breezy, conversational way, ask the basics:
• Do you work? Go to school?
• What are you studying? What do you do for a living?
• Where do you live? (Don’t necessarily press for an address, but a
neighborhood or area can be helpful.)
• Are you married? (Unless you already know . . . for sure.)
• Are you recently out of a relationship?
• What are your interests?
• How do you know the person who fixed us up?
• Don’t you hate the term “fixed up,” as if we’re broken?
It’s a lot easier to get this stuff out of the way on the phone before you’re
face to face.
 Rule 4: Once you’ve agreed you like each other enough to actually
meet, meet in a public place for a specified amount of time. For more
guidelines on protecting yourself when you’re dating someone you don’t
know, see the earlier sections, “Online Connections” and “Personal Ads.”

Eight ways to tell if your date’s married
 He gives you only an office or beeper
number.
 She’s never home when you call.
 Your dates tend to occur outside city limits.
 He often excuses himself to call the “office”
well after office hours.
 Spur-of-the-moment dates are out of the
question.
 She picks only darkly lit, out-of-the-way
places.
 He’s never available on weekends or 
holidays.
 She has a mysterious rash (or white mark)
on the ring finger of her left hand.

obody goes on a date expecting trouble, but as your mom pointed out,
an ounce of prevention will save you some serious heartache. While
predatory behavior is relatively uncommon, you don’t want it to happen to
you. So arm yourself with information.
Dating is supposed to be fun and exciting. By being aware of potential dan-
gers, you can be alert and informed and confident rather than naively obtuse
or frighteningly paranoid. The Boy Scouts said a mouthful — be prepared. I
add, be careful and be aware.
You can prepare yourself by knowing what date rape and stalking are and
how to protect yourself from these behaviors, so I discuss those topics in
this chapter.
Date Rape
No dating book would be complete without a discussion of the darkest side
of dating: date rape. Also called acquaintance rape, both terms are misleading
and contribute to the misunderstanding of this very serious crime. Rape is
rape — a violent felonious assault that is about power, not sex, and that trau-
matizes and injures the victim, perhaps even more so when the victim knows
his or her attacker.

The definition of date rape is confounded by the pervasive sexual stereotype
in our society that men should be the aggressive sexual initiators and women
should “play hard to get.” Both are dangerous assumptions. When mixed with
alcohol and other controlled substances (often a factor in date rapes), they
can be seriously destructive to both parties.
 Rape isn’t about sex; it’s about power.
 Rape is anything after the word “no.” Anything.
College campuses are particularly vulnerable. According to a controversial
1985 study funded by the National Center for the Prevention and Control of
Rape, 25 percent of women in college were victims of rape, and almost 90 per-
cent of them knew their assailants. Of those rapes, 47 percent were by first or
casual dates or by romantic acquaintances.
Myths and facts about date rape
There are a lot of inaccurate perceptions of what date rape is. Some people
(unfortunately, too many) think that date rape is a boys-will-be-boys sce-
nario, or a case of her saying no when she really means yes, or a lover’s dis-
agreement, or a sample of over-reaction, or a meaningless offense. It’s not.
Those and other myths and misperceptions end up clouding the real issue:
that date rape is rape. No exceptions.
MYTH: Lots of date rape accusations turn out to be false reports.
FACT: Most incidences of rape are never reported, particularly in cases of
acquaintance rape where the victim feels guilty or somehow responsible.
According to a survey of reported rapes in Los Angeles County, for example,
fewer than 1 percent were found to be unsubstantiated — less than the false
report rate for either robbery or homicide.
MYTH: Acquaintance rape only occurs between two people who don’t know
each other very well.
FACT: Rape is a violent crime that has nothing to do with how long the
attacker has known the victim. It’s not uncommon to be raped by a longtime
acquaintance, former lover, or spouse.
MYTH: Rape is a crime against women.
FACT: Men are sexually assaulted as well — and not just by gay men. Rape
is an act of violence and brutality, not sexuality. One survey of convicted
318

rapists found that about half didn’t care what sex their victim was; they
raped both men and women.
How to protect yourself if you’re a man
It can be confusing to be a guy out there navigating the treacherous waters of
the dating scene. Some women do send out mixed signals. No doubt about it.
Some guys are a bit blinded by their desires. Still, to protect yourself, as well
as the women you’re dating, I want you to consider the following points
before your relationships progress to the sexual stage:
 If your date is sending a mixed message, assume “maybe” means no.
You don’t want to make love to someone who is unsure about making
love to you. Talk about it. Clarify how she feels. Proceed only when both
of you are ready.
 Assuming you both want the same amount of intimacy at exactly the
same moment is a mistake. Your date may be interested in sexual con-
tact other than intercourse. I know it’s hard to do, but it’s important to
continuously check on each other’s desires rather than just making con-
venient or self-serving assumptions that may be very dangerous.
 A woman who says “no” to sex is not necessarily saying “no” to you as
a person. She may just want to pursue being physical more slowly.
 Just because she’s in your room doesn’t mean she wants to be in
your bed.
 Your size and physical presence can be intimidating to a woman. If
she doesn’t struggle, it may be because she feels too afraid.
 Intoxication (either yours or hers) is not a legal or moral defense for
rape.
 No matter what has transpired, “No” means “Stop now — go no fur-
ther.” That’s not only the moral definition, but the legal definition as
well. I don’t care what’s happened up to this point.
How to protect yourself if you’re a woman
It’s true that anybody can say no at any time: at hand holding, kissing, pet-
ting, right up to penetration. If you say no, that means that your partner must
stop, but you have to be smart, too. You have to avoid sending mixed signals,
like protesting one moment and then coyly relenting, purposefully trying to
turn him on and off like a faucet, or agreeing to an intimate dinner at his place
319
Chapter 27: Dangerous Dates: The Dark Side

when you have no intention of becoming intimate, or making suggestive com-
ments in public and turning cool once you’re alone. That’s game playing, and
it’s dangerous. You abusing your power is no more attractive than him abus-
ing his. After all, if you’re not clear on what you mean, how can you expect
him to be? Be smart and follow these guidelines:
 Avoid situations that put you at risk. Don’t go up to his room if you
really don’t want to be there.
 When you say no, say it with a period instead of a question mark. No
means no, not “maybe” and not “convince me.” Don’t be stupid.
 Never cry rape as a way of getting even or getting attention. This is
serious, serious stuff and can ruin both of your lives if it’s not true. A
false allegation of rape is illegal.
Other things to keep in mind:
 Don’t invite trouble by inviting yourself into a compromising situation
and then playing dumb. “What kind of girl do you think I am?”
 Understand, men have been taught that if they don’t make a pass, you’ll
think they’re gay, so no fair baiting them.
 Rubbing against a man’s penis is going to get him excited, and he’ll feel
you should finish what you started, so don’t get started.
 Using alcohol as a way of excusing yourself from responsible behavior is
misleading to him and dangerous for you. Nobody ever does anything
drunk they don’t wish they could do sober.
How to protect yourself from 
the date rape drug
In the late ’90s, an alarming rise in the use of a drug called Rohypnol or
“roofie” was reported across the country. Known on the street as a “love
drug,” a roofie is a potent tranquilizer — several times stronger than Valium.
As originally formulated, it was tasteless and odorless. When sprinkled in
someone’s drink, sedation occurs in about 20 minutes to half an hour and
lasts for several hours. The effects are similar to alcohol: muscle relaxation,
slurred speech, slowing of motor skills. But there is one notable exception:
The drug produces amnesia as well. There were numerous reports of young
women waking up in frat houses or other unfamiliar surroundings, without
clothes on, having been sexually assaulted but not remembering a thing. (As
of the writing of this book, the manufacturers of Rohypnol have added a sub-
stance that makes the drug give off a blue tinge when dissolved in liquid.)
320
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

Roofies, also called ruffies, roche, R-2, rib, and rope, are known on the street
as the date rape drug of choice even though statistically they’re present in
the bloodstream in less than 3 percent of all reported rape victims. (Alcohol
is still the major drug of abuse in this country — especially in date rape.) The
dangers don’t stop there. When mixed with alcohol and other drugs, roofies
can kill. Your breathing slows to such an extent that you stop breathing at all.
To protect yourself:
 Don’t take any type of drug handed to you at a party.
 Refuse a drink offered by a stranger.
If you should “wake up” and not remember where you’ve been, report it to
the police immediately.
Even at the height of the “roofie” scare, alcohol was and is still the number
one date rape drug. More people have found themselves in dangerous situa-
tions due to alcohol than all other substances combined.
The current hot drug is methamphetamine, which is passed around as an
aphrodisiac, and also is not dropped unknowingly but used consensually to
heighten sexual pleasure. It is known as crystal meth, ice, crank, speed, glass,
and chalk. Methamphetamine comes in many forms and can be smoked,
snorted, orally ingested, or injected. Meth is a stimulant on the central ner-
vous system and has a high potential for abuse and addiction. Users can stay
awake for long periods of time and then eventually crash, feeling tired and
depressed, leaving them worse off than before they used the drug. Even small
amounts of meth can produce serious negative effects, including hyperther-
mia and convulsions, which can result in the death of the user. The use of
methamphetamines also increases the user’s risk of heart failure, stroke, and
brain damage.
Stalking
We’ve all heard about celebrity stalkers, but stalking affects an estimated 1.5
million ordinary men, women, and children in the United States each year.
Though more and more states are passing anti-stalking laws, many statutes
define stalking as the “willful, malicious, and repeated following and harass-
ing of another person” and add that an imminent threat of violence must be
made for law enforcement to take action.
Rarely will someone march up to you and verbally threaten to do bodily
harm, but stalking always has an implied threat of violence. Stalking is often
much more sinister and insidious than a stated threat. So that you can take
steps to protect yourself, you need to understand what goes on inside the
stalker’s head.
321
Chapter 27: Dangerous Dates: The Dark Side

Remember the movie Fatal Attraction, in which Glenn Close plays a gorgeous,
sexy, smart, available woman who was willing to be the Michael Douglas
character’s love slave for a weekend? You can just see him thinking, “This is
just too good to be true.” As it turns out, he was right. She was not only a
stalker but a resourceful women who tracked him down, threatened his
family, and killed his daughter’s bunny rabbit.
Someone who is overly attentive, overwhelmingly thoughtful, and wants to
be with you all the time — especially in these days when people seem to fear
commitment — may seem terrific, but there may be a dark side. Believe me, if
someone is too good to be true, believe it: It’s not true.
A person who is too attentive can be rationalized as a product of a match
made in heaven, someone who finally appreciates the real you, but it’s breed-
ing grounds for a stalker. A stalker is someone who craves that closeness in an
addictive sense and whose own sense of self is so fragile the instant bonding
with another is the only way he or she can quell the loneliness. A stalker will
try to cut you off from your friends and wants to have all of your time because
this is somebody who craves control rather than somebody who craves you.
With most stalkers, the seeds of the trouble are there from the beginning, but
since we all want to be loved, we write this initial clinginess off to infatuation
that is engendered by our wonderfulness. You may have been in relationships
with people who didn’t have time for you (and who hasn’t), so you may be
seduced by the notion that somebody really wants to be with you all the time,
but beware: If there’s any question in your mind, then back off.
Understand that the unbelievable instant closeness is just that — unbelievable.
Obsession is not love. It is need, and the object of the obsession is nearly irrel-
evant. You make yourself safer from a stalker by not letting things get started,
because once a stalker gets started, he or she is really hard to stop.
Profile of a stalker
A stalker is incredibly needy and unable to carry on the give-and-take neces-
sary in longer-term dating. They can be quite charming initially but turn ugly
when everything isn’t going exactly as planned for them. Stalkers are:
 Obsessed with the object (you) of their desire: Stalkers are looking for
attention. If they can’t get this attention in a positive way, negative atten-
tion will do.
 Out of touch with reality and able to hear only what they want to hear:
For instance, “I’m sorry, I’m not ready for a relationship” translates as
“Wait for me.” “I have a boyfriend or girlfriend” means someone is in the
way of the two of you getting together.
322
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

 Nothing if not persistent: If you let the phone ring 30 times before pick-
ing up, the stalker assumes it takes 31 rings to get through to you.
 Self-involved: Stalkers are unable to see things from any perspective
other than their own.
How to protect yourself from a stalker
First and foremost, the moment you sense someone is overly persistent in
pursuing you, take it seriously. Denying the problem only makes the stalker
try harder to get your attention. Instead, do the following:
 Sever all communication. Don’t try to let him or her down easy. Be firm
and be specific. “I am not interested in having any type of relationship
with you, now or in the future.” I know it sounds harsh, but it’s impor-
tant to extinguish even the faintest glimmer of hope.
 Change your regular routine. If you usually leave for work at 8:15 to
catch the 8:30 bus, carpool it some days, or get to the office early.
 Don’t react. If the person who’s been following you suddenly shows up in
the cafeteria at school, try not to look scared or shocked. That’s exactly
the reaction they want. Instead, ignore them entirely and sit with a group
of friends.
 Let people know what’s happening. Tell your co-workers, teachers,
friends, parents, doormen — anyone you trust who sees you on a regu-
lar basis. When you’re being stalked, everyone needs to be on the look-
out for your safety.
 Carry a cell phone. You want help to be three numbers away: 9-1-1.
 Plan ahead. Know where police stations are. Park only in well-lit areas.
Hang with friends more than alone. Don’t give a stalker any opportunity
to have some private time with you.
 Keep your old phone number but get a second number. Experts sug-
gest getting a second phone number and hooking an answering machine
up to the first. That way, you can document threatening phone calls and
you never have to answer no matter how many times the stalker calls.
 Never meet the person for one last time. It could be your last date ever
with anyone if the person feels there is no hope and therefore nothing to
lose by harming you.
 Finally, if the stalking seems to escalate rather than dissipate, call the
police. Ask to speak with one of their stalking specialists who is trained
to evaluate cues to determine if the threatened violence is indeed real.
323
Chapter 27: Dangerous Dates: The Dark Side

Stalkers don’t necessarily look like something out of a horror flick or wear 
T-shirts saying I’M CREEPY, so you need to be aware of the warning signs:
 Someone who wants to spend every waking hour with you
 Someone who calls or e-mails you dozens of times a day
 Someone who demands to know where you are and who you’re with
every moment
 Someone who waits outside your job or home for you all the time
 Someone who monitors your cell phone bill
 Someone who wants to know your password

I
don’t want to end our discussion of dating on a sour note by talking about
the dangers, even though I would be remiss if I didn’t include Chapter 27.
But whether you love dating or view it as a necessary process, I want you to
have the option to retire yourself from the search by concentrating on and
enriching your — dare I say — relationship so if you choose, you can date
each other after the wedding, the kids, the cocker spaniel, retirement, senior
housing, and beyond.
Being romantic in the early days of dating is a no-brainer, but how can you
keep the fun, energy, interest, and, yeah, romance alive on an ongoing basis?
We’ve now taught you how to figure out who you are, what you want, and set
up a date. You’ve gone on your first date, had an incredibe time, and have
survived the early stages of a relationship. What you want to do is not start
this whole process all over again.
We’ve spoken about casual, serious, and heavy dating and here is the step-by-
step, how-to to turn heavy dating into a potential (drum roll . . .) relationship.
Think of your relationship as a budding plant complete with aluminum foil
and a big bow. You can’t put that fabbo plant in a window and ignore it — it

needs pruning, watering, and nurturing as well as the proper environment so
the wonderful plant can continue to grow and thrive and make you happy.
Your cool new relationship needs the same care, consideration, and knowl-
edge. The following sections suggest ways to keep that relationship alive,
wonderful, and terrific!
Send Flowers for No Reason
St. Valentine’s Day conjures images of candies in foil hearts, boxed roses, and
a romantic dinner. But the real romance of Valentine’s Day isn’t the food or
the flowers: It’s the feeling of being important enough to someone else to be
remembered and fussed over and loved and cherished. It’s sharing a loving
(not necessarily sexual) experience; picking out a scent together or choosing
warm, woolen mittens or a perfect scented candle or a fuzzy warm blanket or
a CD you both like. It’s a shared ice cream cone.
Well, I’ve got news for you: You don’t have to wait for February 14 to get or
give that feeling. Just as you can have Christmas in July, you can make any
day Valentine’s Day. Just try a few of the ideas in this chapter — any day of
the year — and I’ll bet you can melt your date’s heart faster than chocolate in
August, with a lot less mess.
Flowers remind us of Mother Nature at her most lovely, which is always help-
ful when dealing with romance. Plants are lovely, but not nearly as romantic.
If sending your date flowers worked initially, then flowers will also work even-
tually (and basically flowers always work). Sending flowers to your soon-to-
be or is already incredibly significant other for no reason is a great idea.
Women, this idea works for you, too, except if you are sending flowers,
make sure that they vaguely look like something a guy would enjoy receiving,
which means no long-stem roses (especially if it’s for no reason), but maybe
an amaryllis, (the so-called boy flower) chrysanthemums, or anything exotic,
even a plant. Be sure that you choose something vaguely “manly,” which
means forget the teddy bears, kissy faces, or cherubs, especially if you are
sending it to his office. Getting teased unmercifully may not make him all that
pleased, amorous, or grateful.
Guys, all of this advice can be completely ignored when it comes to sending
women flowers. We all get completely gushy about almost anything, and if
guys knew the real impact of flowers, they’d keep a florist on retainer. Just be
careful not to send the same flowers for birthdays, fights, or special events.
Roses are romantic, but don’t get in a rut.
326
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

Even though we all know that flowers come from seeds and take work and
care — they need to be watered, weeded, fertilized with just the right amount
of manure, dead-headed, and so on — a beautiful flower reminds us of the
bounty of life and the possibility of artistry. What better symbol than a flower
to represent the birds and the bees (even Belle in Disney’s Beauty and the
Beast is transfixed by the glow of a frozen flower that can be melted and
brought back to life by love).
327
Chapter 28: Keeping It Fresh, Alive, and Healthy
A rose by any other name . . .
Flowers symbolize new life. It’s no wonder suit-
ors give their loved ones flowers to show the
blossoming of their love. Interestingly, flowers
also symbolize purity and virginity. Hence the
notion of “deflowering” a young bride. Specific
flowers have specific meanings, as well.
Though it’s open to interpretation, here’s a con-
sensus of what certain flowers mean.

Trust me, anything that works on the designated holiday works even better
on a random day and is scads cheaper. The bouquet can be hand delivered
by you or sent if you’re feeling flush or shy; you can send a dozen roses or a
single stem, orchids or violets, seasonal or hothouse. The point isn’t the lav-
ishness, but the thoughtfulness.
Write a Love Note
Just as flowers speak volumes, putting pen to paper bespeaks extra effort,
something from the heart. Those little love notes that you wrote when you
were first getting involved or maybe after you first hooked up, the sort of
“what I like about you” romantic thoughts, are always a good idea.
You don’t have to rhyme, be Bill Shakespeare, or be flowery. Cards are fine,
but struggling through on your own is even better. Don’t try to be cute or
funny. Your words don’t have to be poetry (although poetry’s cool), and if
you’re really talented at drawing, terrific, add a sketch or two. But the point
here isn’t so much about artistry as sincerity. Just write a sweet sentiment
from your heart, something gentle and touching — and try not to make it a
mash note (body parts shouldn’t be too graphically mentioned).
Buying a nice sheet of paper is much better than ripping something out of
your notebook, and post ’ems are to be avoided just this once. Don’t even
think about typing the note. If your handwriting is lousy, print — and no
pencil, please. Also, try not to misspell a whole lot. Just make sure your
note’s legible, and don’t worry about points off for punctuation (after all,
your love isn’t your English teacher — I hope). Understand that the real value
in writing a love note is that it’s hard to do. We’ve all been talking a lot longer
than we’ve been writing, so sometimes you can really get to the heart of the
matter (get it??) a bit more quickly by putting pen to paper rather than word
to mouth.
A love note is hand written, never typed, and don’t even think about 
e-mailing — old-fashioned is romantic, thoughtful, and special.
One last word about love notes: Make sure it doesn’t fall into the wrong
hands. No passing it out in class. It may make as much sense to leave it on a
pillow (without breaking into his or her house) and leave it someplace pri-
vate rather than someplace public. X-rated notes may come back to haunt
you; we’re talking love notes, not smut notes here. If you send a note to work
with someone, make sure that somebody else won’t discover it. So having it
fall out of a briefcase at a business meeting is not a good idea.
328
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

Reminisce about Your First Mutual Date
Even if it was a disaster, thinking back to how you two got started is fun.
Sharing your history with each other can give you both a perspective that
allows you to weather temporary glitches on the radar better, because of the
sense of shared past. Nothing is more romantic than the sense that you’ve
come through troubled times together. It’s the metaphorical equivalent of
being cozied up in front of a roaring fire together with a cold wind blowing
outside.
Reminiscing in a note or conversation can help remind each other of some of
the landmarks in your relationship — your first date, your first kiss, or the
first time you both just knew it was serious — any of the things that make
you feel closer to one another.
Share Baby Pictures and Stories
Your mom trots out your baby pictures for a reason: You were really cute and
cuddly and sweet and innocent, and there’s something elemental and basic
and charming and nostalgic about seeing who you were then. I know you’re
feeling a little silly about this, but if you’re willing to show your love a little
about who you were then, your love will know a bit more about who you’ve
become. Just don’t make this sharing time a chapter meeting for the dysfunc-
tional and abused victims of the world. No harsh episodes or horror stories.
You don’t actually have to wait to visit your family to trot out old pix of the
former you (as if visiting parents wasn’t traumatic enough).
If you can’t conjure up any pleasant memories from your childhood, you
probably need to think therapy, not dating. It’s really true that it’s hard to
love anyone else until you can love yourself. And if you can’t love your baby
self, get some help so that you can.
Do make sure that neither you nor the family have a hidden agenda here by
conjuring up the recently dumped miscellaneous love — no manipulation —
just mushy sharing and no reminiscing about first loves, wild vacations of
youthful indiscretions. What seems like intimacy when it comes to sexual his-
tory can come back to haunt you.
329
Chapter 28: Keeping It Fresh, Alive, and Healthy

Give a Massage
There are ways of being physical that don’t require sex. Certainly dancing,
holding hands, and massages are sensual and sexy.
What you’re going for here is a way to celebrate sensual intimacy indepen-
dent of sexuality. A massage isn’t necessarily seduction — we’re not talking
“complete release” here — but pleasure; it’s sensual — good feelings that
aren’t genitally centered, feeling warm, happy, contented — not sexual. Also,
the idea isn’t you do me and I’ll do you. Treat the massage like a gift; you can
get your own massage at a later time.
For a massage, you can either splurge on some good massage oil, use baby
oil, or put a drop of almond extract in mineral oil for a lovely scent. Find a flat
surface in a comfortably warm room (okay, yeah, a bed will work, but we’re
going for sensuous, not sexual here — just keep telling yourself that), and
make sure that you’re not messing up your best sheets or towels. Find some
soothing music and soft lighting. Too bright isn’t relaxing, and too dark
makes it hard to find each other.
If you’re giving a full-body massage, remember to include the hands and feet.
Because you’re going for intimacy and closeness, not sex here, it’s a good
idea to exclude genitalia, and always offer the option of underwear kept on.
(If the two of you aren’t at that stage of your relationship, offer a hand and
foot massage as an alternative to a full body massage or scout up a profes-
sional masseuse or masseur. The gift of massage is always lovely but even
more special if it’s you personally laying on hands.)
Take your time — at least an hour — and warm up the oil in your hands first.
If you’re still not sure about how to give a massage, look for a good book
about massage and practice on a friend first (who will undoubtedly love you
forever).
Shampoo and Bathe Your Love
From earliest times, from the Romans to the Japanese, baths have had ritual
status as a way of not only purifying, but also of preparing and relaxing and
celebrating.
Geishas have it right. There is something very loving about washing someone:
warm water, soap, bubbles. The sensations take us back to being cared for and
pampered and loved. A long, careful, gentle shampoo is lovely enough to have
a very sexy movie named after it, starring Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn. If
you can find some scented candles and soft music, so much the better, but
resist the notion of a quicky shower; vertical just doesn’t quite do it.
330
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

Bathing together (especially when there is a hygiene problem) and shampoo-
ing one another as part of lovemaking can be fun and a nifty way of by-passing
those less than romantic odor discussions. You can also make it independent
of lovemaking. In fact, all of these things are probably most romantic when
they are independent of sex. Playing geisha girl or boy to your loved one is a
loving basic thing to do; primates groom one another. It is relaxed; it slows the
pace down of a hectic existence. To set the mood, you can use rose petals or
bubble bath, light candles, or play music. Giving each other the time, the
space, and the energy to tune in to one another is the ultimate gift.
If your relationship hasn’t moved to a sexual level, it’s okay to wear bathing
suits. The idea is fun and pampering and sensuality, not seduction.
Clean Your Love’s Place
If baths are sexy and sensual, shampooing a rug (no, not his toupee, silly)
and cleaning her sink (don’t even think about it) can certainly drive some of
us into a frenzy of appreciation and love. The idea of someone we love doing
something we loathe just for us is really cool. Besides, cleaning someone
else’s place isn’t nearly as icky as digging out your own.
If you are going to clean someone’s apartment, make sure that this isn’t inter-
preted as “you are a slob, and I can’t stand the clutter around here anymore.”
Don’t even think about throwing away things that your friend loves and will
kill you for throwing out. It’s not about changing someone else’s behavior by
manipulating them, but about showing how much you care about the person.
Polishing the chrome in the bathroom or waxing the floor is okay, but throw-
ing things out is not okay.
Remember, no fair peeking into drawers, and giving a gift certificate good for
doing the laundry, cleaning the oven, moving the lawn, or waxing the car or
floor is probably better than risking being arrested for breaking and entering
by trying to do it as a surprise.
Give a “Generous Soul” Gift Certificate
In an ongoing relationship, after the initial months of proving how much we
love love love anything our date wants to do, sooner or later, it will occur to
you both that you’re not identical and actually enjoy some activities the
other one loathes.
Even though the best relationships are based on communality of interest,
into every relationship a certain amount of difference falls. She loves profes-
sional wrestling, he loves ballet; he loves horses, she gets starry-eyed over
331
Chapter 28: Keeping It Fresh, Alive, and Healthy

drag racing. But going someplace you loathe because you love someone who
wants to be there is a sign of not only being in love, but also of being a gener-
ous, considerate, empathetic, and sensitive adult as well. So no whining!
Being a good sport is way cool — especially if you keep reminding yourself
that karma is a boomerang.
Rather than being dragged kicking and screaming, offer an ollie, ollie home
free good for one date, to any event you usually loathe, without complaint,
and with no strings attached. Not only is it good karma, but it’s also an
opportunity to stop being a pain in the neck and experience something volun-
tarily that you may actually learn to like or at least tolerate because it was
your idea in the first place.
The willingness to do something you hate because someone you love loves it
is one of the true signs of love.
Or give a gift certificate saying “here is a night out with the girls or boys” with-
out recrimination, without recompense, and without whining. This is saying “I
really care about you and I really want to make you happy, and even though
we do lots of things together, we don’t have to do everything together.” It is
also a good practice to remember that, if you are talking about a long-term
relationship, the two of you do not have to be joined at the hip. Obviously, I’m
not suggesting you spend all your time apart from each other, but there is
some indication that couples who have time away from one another actually
do very well.
Remember this is a gift, not a contract.
Plan a Mystery Date
Instead of falling back on the old stand-by or the “So what do you want to
do?” ploy, take the time and care to plan and prepare a special date. Don’t
make your date responsible for anything other than showing up. You pick the
place, choose the activity, buy the tickets, arrange for the dinner — you get
the picture.
It’s important to settle on the time ahead of time so that you’re not trying to
whisk your love off to Paris for the weekend just before a major presentation
is due on Monday or to a romantic picnic on the day the corporate boss is
scheduled to come in for a review. Your feelings will be hurt at their likely
response, and this is Romance 101, not Guilt for Fun and Profit. But once
you’ve agreed on the day or the hour or the weekend or the month, let your-
self get really creative. Pretend you are planning the world’s most spectacular
experience to delight the head and heart of the one you love.
332
Part VII: Playing It Safe and Keeping It Fresh 

You can pick something lavish or low-key, romantic or rustic, close or far
away. Just make sure that you are planning something your love will enjoy,
not your fantasy date and place. Focus on making a date, with all the trim-
mings, to delight your love. The date doesn’t need to be expensive, just imag-
inative: A picnic can work as well as a cruise, a home-cooked meal as well as
a catered affair. We’re talking heart, not wallet. Just taking responsibility in
doing something that you know will please the other person can be very
romantic and very lovely.
Take a Hike to Someplace New
The beginning of a relationship is always about new and different. But if the
two of you have been together enough to consider each other exclusive —
you’re in the heavy dating stage and six months into a relationship — you
may find that you are repeating activities. For example, you frequently drop
into your favorite neighborhood restaurant, you have a Saturday night movie
date, or you hang with your posse. Spice up your relationship and show your
special someone that you care about them by doing something new that you
haven’t done before such as taking a walk to a new place.
By putting some effort into the new and different activities, you are demon-
strating that your honey is worth putting yourself out for. The local weekend
section of your newspaper is a great source of ideas.
Yeah, I know this sounds like a metaphor, and it probably is, but we are influ-
enced by our own behavior. A walk makes a slower pace, together in a larger
world, exploring a place neither of you have ever been before. Look, don’t be
silly. I’m not talking about walking through a dark park at midnight and wor-
rying about whether or not you’re going to get mugged, and getting lost isn’t
necessarily romantic. Use caution and sense and your head. Go for a walk on
a new beach or a national park in daylight, a hike through the woods, or even
a stroll around the block. The idea is experiencing both something new and
part of the greater world together. A picnic lunch is optional.
Other cool places to experience together:
 Aquariums: Water is always romantic, just don’t go out for seafood 
afterwards.
 Zoos: Don’t go on a Sunday unless absolutely necessary or you’re very
fond of small kids.
 Amusement parks: Beware of rides that make you nauseous.
 Water parks: Fun and water are seductive.
333
Chapter 28: Keeping It Fresh, Alive, and Healthy

 Beaches: I love the water; I’m prejudiced.
 Museums and sculpture gardens: You can walk, hold hands, and talk.
 Botanical gardens: Make sure it’s not hay fever season.
 Churches: The air is special, and candlelight is always flattering.
 Rowboats: Being on the water is lovely if you can row.
 Mountains: Don’t get caught unprepared.
 The desert: Being outside is almost always lovely, and a desert is 
austere and basic. Bring water.
 Paris: Okay, so I love spitting cherry pits and walking on the Champs
Elysee.
 Redwood forest: Being around something that’s been around that long
puts things in perspective.
 New York at Christmas: What can I say?
 Carriage rides: Lots of cities have them.
 Fireplaces: Gets us right back to the caves and our ancestors.
 Country lanes: Beware of traffic.
Gazillions of dollars are spent every year on Valentine’s Day when lovers con-
spicuously demonstrate their affection and commitment to one another. It’s
ironic that the original Valentine was an imprisoned soon-to-be martyred early
Christian saint who sent messages to his followers or performed a marriage
ceremony for his jailers (depending on whose story you believe). You can
make any date Valentine’s Day by showing the same concern and love without
being either imprisoned or martyred. In fact, it should make you both giggle!
The point of St. Valentine’s messages was thinking about the concerns of his
friends even though he was imprisoned. You’re not imprisoned or a martyr,
and we’re talking more than friendship here, but you get the point.

he Internet has both broadened and widened the playing field for dating.
There are literally thousands of folks out there just waiting to circle or be
clicked on — so how do you enjoy and profit from this brave new world?
Listen up and read on.
The To-Do List of Online Dating
Many of us just love lists as a way of being organized and encouraging a
sense of accomplishment as just generally feeling we are in control of our
own destiny — so here is a way of condensing a complicated, multifaceted
process into succinct, comprehensive, forward-moving steps.

Be precise
When writing an Internet personal ad or filling out an online dating question-
naire, it’s useful to pretend that you have to pay by the word, whether you
actually have to pay for it or not. Be as specific as possible. Think about who
you are and what makes you unusual and list both your successes and your
failures. Don’t allow yourself to wander into abstractions or use trite phrases.
No moonlight strolls, walks in the park, or I’m a true romantic; these descrip-
tions of yourself are meaningless, overused, and silly. Remind yourself that a
very focused intent is time saving, practical, and useful, so be thoughtful and
specific. For example, you might say, “I’m a homebody who really loves cook-
ing, but also likes camping.” That description gives somebody a clear idea of
your snow-flakicity, your unique self: Saying, “I’m looking for someone who is
not afraid of snakes, but also is not a carnivore” sets you apart as a vegetar-
ian camper with a big vocabulary.
The trick here is to be focused enough to winnow the field and be honest and
compelling without being so narrow that nobody on the face of the earth
could ever meet your criteria. You want your ad to be honest, compelling, eye
catching, sane, reflective of who you are, and different from everybody else’s
efforts.
Even if you don’t post your personal ad, figuring out who you are and what
you want is a wonderful exercise.
Make your English teacher proud
Check and then double-check your grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
Nothing will make you look more like a doofus than misspelled words or
incorrect grammar in your ad. Have somebody proofread your ad even if
you’re doing this on the QT and you’re trying to be very clever and have
nobody know. Ask a discreet friend to read your listing over to make sure it
makes sense and has no major lapses of logic, taste, or grammar. Always do
a spell check.
Keep the fibs to a minimum
Okay, I could say be completely truthful, but no one ever is. For those of you
who know me, I think people are allowed to lie about three things in life: their
age, their weight, and their sexual history. Unfortunately, on an Internet dating
site, those things tend to be the minefield.
338
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

 Your age should certainly be within several years of your actual age.
Everybody is allowed to shave a year or two, but no decade reductions.
Beware of saying things like “salt and pepper hair,” when you haven’t
had any hair on your head since dirt was invented.
 Make sure any physical description roughly correlates with what your
mirror reflects, not what your heart desires.
 Beware of women who use “code” and say they’re “voluptuous,” which
translates into “35 pounds overweight.” Be honest about who you are. If
you’re a little heavy, then say, “I’m a little heavy. I can live with it, can
you?” This is a much better thing than lying about your weight.
 As for sexual history, don’t go there! Your indiscretions are best forgot-
ten or dealt with in the confessional or therapy, but certainly not on the
Web site with strangers.
Use an appropriate photo
You don’t necessarily have to post a picture with your description, but the
number of responses increases dramatically if you do. Here are some tips on
using a picture:
 Use a fairly recent picture.
 Don’t be tempted to use your cute friend’s picture or your brother’s bar
mitzvah picture.
 Avoid unduly flattering, glam shots because you want very little discrep-
ancy between the picture and what you really look like (you don’t want
your date to receive any nasty shocks!). It’s much smarter to elicit a
comment such as “My goodness, you’re much better looking in person”
instead of “Oh my God, is this what you really look like?”
 Don’t even think about using a picture of yourself with your arm around
somebody of the opposite sex (duh), and if you’re thinking about cutting
the person out or pasting someone else’s face on the body, fuhgetaboutit.
 Be careful about using props like dogs, boats, or a fancy car. This is
about you, so it should be a good head shot of you alone.
 Women, don’t be tempted to be too sexy in your picture because unless
you’re looking for a one-night stand, you’re going to send the wrong mes-
sage. The same type of info applies to guys: Keep your shirt on.
339
Chapter 29: Ten+ Do’s and Don’ts of Internet Dating

Provide only a cell phone number
There’s a joke about the guy who gives his baby doll wife a cell phone for
her birthday with instructions to keep it turned on whenever she leaves the
house. To test her, he calls her, and she is thrilled: “Honey this is wonderful.
I just love my new cell phone, but how did you know I was at the mall?”
Joking aside, you need to remind yourself that a person who found you on
the Web is a stranger. So don’t give your home phone number, which some-
one could track to your address. Practice safety first by giving out only your
cell phone number, which also offers the protection of caller ID, an off switch,
and mobility. A cell phone allows you to be anywhere without anyone know-
ing where you are. In case of a lunatic or a stalker, in the worst-case scenario,
you can get rid of it if you need to.
Date within a 25-mile radius
You may be one of those people who looks for potential dates on vacations or
planes, or with someone who is traveling through town. Be careful, however.
Long-distance relationships are initially thrilling, but soon become poisonous
because they’re often more fantasy than reality. Have people met other
people on bike trips through Provence? Yes, but leave that happenstance to
happenstance. When you’re investing in the specific intent to find somebody,
be reasonable and sensible and play the odds. Find somebody who is in your
zip code if possible, your area code preferably, and your time zone certainly,
so that you can actually get to know each other without the constraints that
a long-distance relationship places on things. Make it as easy on yourself and
your date to be as geographically close as possible, to allow for emotional
and physical intimacy as an organic, unfolding project.
Meet publicly and make sure someone
knows where you are
Remember that the person you meet online is a stranger. Let me say this
again: This person is a stranger! If you wouldn’t meet a blind date at your
house, if you wouldn’t get into a car with a stranger, if you wouldn’t give
someone you’ve never met before your phone number, don’t do any of these
things with someone you meet online. Please reassure me that in fact you
wouldn’t do any of the above. Meet in a public place, and make sure that
somebody you know and trust is aware of your whereabouts. Practice a mod-
icum of sensible behavior. In real life, you wouldn’t go off with strangers, and
this is indeed still real life — with the computer as intermediary.

The Never-Do List of Online Dating
If common sense were common, I’d be out of business. I’m just reminding you
what you already know when you’re thinking with your head — consider me
your favorite Aunt Mathilda who’s looking out for you.
Don’t stay online too long before a meeting
Studies show that looking at a computer screen gives a false sense of inti-
macy with a resulting loss of inhibitions. When you’re dealing with strangers,
as you are in online dating, inhibitions serve a valuable and healthy function.
So if you lose your inhibitions without knowing to whom you’re making your-
self vulnerable, you put yourself in a careless and dangerous situation.
I know that receiving those first e-mails from an online dating prospect is a
thrill. What’s not to love about coming home to hear, “You’ve got mail!” A
week or two of fantasy fun is sufficient, but then it’s time to bite the bullet
and actually meet face to face, with a brief pit stop at phone calls so you can
at least be assured of gender and voice recognition. If you spend any more
time in fantasyland, you’re creating an artificial sense of intimacy, which is
very difficult to overcome. Remember that you want dating, not danger, as
the eventual outcome.
Never online date on an office computer
I know you have a computer at your office, but if you don’t have one at home,
invest in a cheap laptop or a used computer, but don’t online date at the
office. Keep your personal life and your office life separate. You may think
that you’ve covered your tracks or that online dating after hours doesn’t
count, but the headlines and dockets are full of folks who believed that e-mail
and computers are secure. Not only will most companies object strenuously
to doing personal stuff (strangely enough they expect you to do their work if
you’re being paid), but they have access to anything done on their equip-
ment. If I need to explain this any further, you need either a therapist or a
parole officer.
As long as I’m on the subject, allow me to vigorously caution you to avoid
dating people at your office or even going into elaborate detail on your online
dating life. Work is always about competence, and everyone will know if some-
thing is going on. Sexual harassment is a legal issue. Flirting is a potential, if
somewhat risky, way of waiting until one of you has a going away party and
then you can pounce, but not before and never at the company Christmas
party.
341
Chapter 29: Ten+ Do’s and Don’ts of Internet Dating

Don’t get seduced in online “shopping”
One of the most dramatic good news/bad news scenarios of Internet dating
is that there are just so many options. Certainly that’s the major reason to
indulge, but beware the seduction of the “Gee, I wonder who’s around the
next e-mail corner” phenomenon. If you find somebody you like and you’ve
had half a dozen dates, you may want to consider going offline for a while.
Beware of juggling too many people at the same time. While it’s perfectly
okay to go slowly and initially see more than one candidate, especially if your
dates are continuing also online, the giddiness of “so many profiles, so little
time” can be self-defeating. If you do find somebody who you think may be a
keeper, both of you can agree to take your profiles off the Internet, allowing
for a more normalized dating environment. Both of you always know that you
can resurrect your profiles if things don’t work out.
Don’t rely on humor or sexual innuendo
I can hear you saying that this heading must be a misprint: “My sense of
humor is the best thing I have, and dating is all about sexy!” Take a deep
breath here. You don’t know how strangers will interpret something as indi-
vidual and personal as humor. Senses of humor can differ greatly depending
on a person’s gender, age, culture, mood, or ethnicity or the context in which
the humor is used. Given the fact that you’re not going to be privy to any of
this up front, err on the side of safety by being as straightforward as possible.
You can be charming and witty, but be careful of innuendo or humor until you
have eyeball-to-eyeball contact. That way, you can look each other in the eye
and make sure that what you’re saying is going over. Humor and innuendo
are intended to soften, lighten, and divert — you’re trying initially for clarity
with very little possibility of misinterpretation. The bottom line in all this is
to stay focused: Remember what you’re doing — this should be fun, but you
do need to stay focused. Make sure what you’re doing makes some sense.

L
ove. Amour. Amore. In popular fiction, the signs of true love tend toward
the melodramatic: heart palpitations, loss of sleep, loss of appetite, blow-
ing curtains, fireworks. But let me tell you: If you feel these things, you’re not
so much in love as lust — or you’ve gotten a hold of new cheese or old meat
and need a good internist or a stomach pump.
Here is a list of the undeniable signs of true love — and good (emotional)
health. And, romantic that I am, I will concede at least one heart flutter.
You Actually Want to Meet the Parents
Even if you’re a thousand years old, the idea of explaining yourself to your
love’s parents is terrifying: After all, they’ve known and loved the cherub
longer than you have, and they’ll question your motives, your intentions,
your behavior, your lineage, your table manners, your bank account, your
morals, your intelligence, and your commitment. If you’re willing to put your-
self through this kind of scrutiny to move into further intimacy, it has to be
love — or masochism. I’m definitely willing to give you the benefit of the
doubt.

You’re Willing to Explain Why You
Don’t Want to Date Others
With all the nasty little diseases around, the idea of sleeping around is a lot
less attractive than it used to be — and I’m not sure that sleeping around was
ever all that attractive — so the issue here isn’t a willingness to be exclusive.
It’s a willingness to talk about and explain being exclusive. A surprisingly large
number of men and women are surreptitiously monogamous, feeling that
their willingness to forgo all others gives power to the partner. But when
you’re willing to admit that you’re willing to share the power and admit your
vulnerability (I really like you and hope you like me as much), not only are
you in love, but you sound like a rational, fairly adult soul in the bargain.
You’ll Ditch Your Little Black Book
This is a statement of not only exclusivity but future plans for exclusivity,
essentially saying that no one of your acquaintance holds a candle to your
beloved. Your willingness to get rid of the book gives tangible proof of that
reality. Getting rid of the black book also says that you’re unwilling to revisit
past loves and that, in this relationship, there is no going back; you can only
go forward.
No fair throwing the book into the fire but keeping the database on your
trusty laptop. A commitment is a commitment, and this is as much about self
as other. If you pretend to throw away your black book, then you’re also pre-
tending that you’re committed. Grow up; if you’re old enough to be taken
seriously by someone you like, you’re old enough to take yourself seriously.
Committed adult relationships don’t have room for manipulative games.
Throwing away the book is also a realistic acknowledgment that once you
discover someone as wonderful as your beloved, you can only go on from
that person anyway; there is never a reason to go back. People we love have
an effect on us. We grow because of the intimacy of the relationship, and we
become entwined so that even if the relationship ends, we’re different from
how we were before.
344
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

You Breathe Easier When 
He or She Is Around
Please don’t misinterpret here. I’m not saying you can’t breathe when your
beloved isn’t around. I’m saying that the world seems a bit brighter, and you
feel a bit better about yourself. When you feel this way, you’re also past the
infatuation stage, which is the stage where you actually do have a hard time
breathing when the other person is around (those hormones are murder on
lungs) and you’ve gotten past the limerence, the phase where you’re addicted
to love or you love the idea of being in love. You’ve settled into a wonderful
but manageable phase where you work hard to please but not at the expense
of yourself or your beliefs. You’re content and happy and energized and
sleeping well and eating okay — hey, it must be love.
If you can’t breathe when your beloved isn’t around and feel like you’re going
to die, you’re talking serious dependency. If you feel that way, check yourself
into the respiratory therapy unit of your local hospital or a twelve-step pro-
gram with a local therapist.
You Hum Love Songs under Your Breath
Your sense of well-being and happiness is so deep and so easy and so com-
fortable that even when you’re not thinking about your beloved, your sense
of fulfillment permeates your being. You actually concentrate better, work
more efficiently, and are more resilient, but your unconscious is aware that
something very cool is happening, and those love songs just go directly from
your unconscious mind to your lips without ever having to disturb your intel-
lect. This love stuff is working for you on all cylinders.
When you do realize you’re humming a love song, you smile, think of the
words for a moment, remember to mention it to your beloved, and then get
right back to work. Freud was right: All we need is work and love. Good on ya.
You’re Full of Energy
I’m not talking about the kind of energy you feel in the early stages of dating,
when you’re sure your date is “it” and you’re sure you can float on air. I’m
talking about the kind of energy that comes when you know you’ve just hit a
345
Chapter 30: Ten Ways to Know You’re in Love

home run or your recipe for turnip soup is actually edible or those jeans that
were a struggle actually fit or when someone smiles at you on the street on a
sunny day and you feel connected to the universe. This is the energy you feel
when you accomplish something, and in many ways, allowing yourself to be
in love (not fall in love) is a terrific accomplishment. You’ve trusted yourself
and another person, and you’re taking the time and care and risks to build
and maintain an intimate relationship.
When an intimate relationship works — and has been working for a while —
it can truly light up your life. It may not be forest fire, fireworks, explosive,
dramatic stuff — which is really fun but really short lived — but it is the long-
term, this-is-going-to-last-and-I-want-to-nurture-it kind of glow. It may be less
dramatic, but it can burn forever.
You’re Willing to Go Somewhere
You Hate
I think of this as the ballet/boxing phenomenon. The willingness to go some-
place you actually hate with someone you actually love — and not be a pain
in the neck about it — is one of the hallmarks of love.
When you first start to date, you’re tempted to do whatever it takes to get the
date off the ground because you’re blinded by the possibilities. During the next
phase of dating, you stand up for yourself and don’t do the activity you hate.
This is a necessary evolution because if there is to be true love, it has to be
based on who you are, not who you think your beginning-to-be-significant other
will like. But once you actually get to love, your need to constantly assert your-
self is softened by your beloved’s influence and the sense that you can give
because your love will reciprocate your generosity.
You don’t need to keep track on a day-to-day basis to make sure everything is
50-50. (I went to her ballet; now she has to come to the Three Stooges Fifty-
Hour Marathon — how tiresome would that get?) But the sense that there is
fairness and equality and appreciation and respect means that your reluc-
tance to do something you’re not crazy about gets overwhelmed by your
desire to do something with the person you love. In other words, the person
becomes more important than the event.
Yep, looks like love to me.
346
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

You’re Willing to Save If You’re 
a Spendthrift and Spend 
If You’re Chintzy
The point of this section isn’t really about money at all, but a willingness to
examine fundamental beliefs as a direct result of valuing another person and
his or her perspective and opinion. (Yeah, the same phenomenon can happen
with friends, but because friends generally tolerate and celebrate differences,
there’s less motive or incentive for change.)
Any good relationship changes you. If being around your beloved makes you
examine or change some fundamental part of yourself, it may not be love in
and of itself, but it does indicate respect, a willingness to learn from another,
and a relationship in which you feel safe enough to try something foreign and
scary.
I’m not talking flattery or hypocrisy here; I’m talking about having the
courage and strength and energy to examine and experiment with a funda-
mental belief system, be it your view on religion, politics, gun control, abor-
tion, Chinese food, travel, having children, gardening, money, or any other
position you used to consider inviolate. (Money? you say. Yep. It’s hard to
think of any one commodity that is more basic than money. If you think
money is just green stuff that just sits there, you’re wrong; it’s power and
lifestyle and control and options and freedom and interaction and a whole
lot more.)
The Idea of Doing Nothing
Together Sounds Terrific
In the early stages of dating, you’re hungry to discover who the other person
is, but this time also feels scary because he or she may not be what you
thought or — even worse — you may not be what your date is looking for.
Even though the stakes aren’t very high at the beginning, you feel they are, so
you play at dating, and one of the easiest ways to play is to do something at
all times — either publicly or privately. The dating ritual is about finding
places to go and things to do. Once a couple is sexual, the thing to do is
347
Chapter 30: Ten Ways to Know You’re in Love

sexual, and everything else seems just a holding action until the couple can
hit the sheets. Then when the initial flurry of sexual activity is over, there is a
tendency to want to show each other off because you’re feeling connected
and proud and flushed (this can occur before sex and even when a couple is
sexual . . . although hopefully not at exactly that moment), which means
spending a lot of time around other people.
When the idea of doing nothing together is the coolest thing either of you can
come up with, you’re very likely in love, because you’ve gone through the
other stages of terror, sex, and showing off. Now, the relationship is just
about the two of you, not to the exclusion of everyone or anything else. In
fact, your “normal” life has expanded to include each other, but the idea of
simply being together is the most wonderful thing either of you can figure out
to do — even out of bed.
You’re Willing to Risk Being Yourself
Being yourself is really the big enchilada. Everything else on the how-you-
know-you’re-in-love list hints at being yourself, but when you truly love some-
one, you want him or her to know who you are and love you for all that you
are, not just for who you pretend to be. When you’re in a truly loving relation-
ship, you can be honest and direct and take chances.
The tricky part of being in love is that it can encourage you to be yourself but
ups the risk that if you show the real you, someone whom you really want to
stay will change his or her mind and leave. You want your beloved to be happy
now and forever, and the only way to do that is to be who you really are.
Sustaining an illusion over time is almost impossible, and because you are now
truly in love, you wouldn’t want to hurt your beloved by living a lie. But you
also need to be a bit careful of what you confess (see Chapter 20 for advice on
what you should share and what you should keep under your hat). Remember
that between honesty and duplicity is silence. If you’re old enough to be in
love, you’re old enough to understand the occasional use of silence.

n the old days — when dating meant hanging out with a chaperone and
the person your parents had arranged for you to marry when you were
still in diapers — people could pine away for each other, and there was no
risk of sex too soon. If you had sex before you were married, you were road
kill, literally and figuratively. Now we’ve done away with chaperones, arranged
marriages, and parental influence (who was the last date your parents liked?),
and sex is still hanging there, tempting and dangerous.
Which is just fine! After all, sex is powerful stuff: basic, primordial, fun,
messy, seductive — and therefore dangerous. The risk doesn’t mean you
have to avoid sex; it simply means you should treat sex carefully and with
respect, kinda like fire. You want it to warm you, not harm you (the burning
up part I leave to your own personality structure).

Don’t Get Naked Too Soon
The problem with sex is not being physically naked but — if you’re doing it
right — being emotionally naked. Being emotionally naked with a stranger is
really tricky. Sex moves you at the speed of light past things you ought not to
be moving past at all, the getting-to-know-you stage.
There are several ways to know when it’s too soon for sex: when you don’t
know each other’s middle name, when you haven’t talked about protection,
when you’re doing it ’cause you think it’s expected, when you’re just trying to
show your parents they can’t boss you, when you’re afraid the guy won’t call
unless you do, or to prove that you’re not gay.
There is only one real reason to have sex: because you really want to and you
can accept the consequences (and then, for heaven’s sake, be responsible
and make sure nobody gets hurt, sick, or pregnant). You can see why it’s
often wise to wait.
No House Calls Until Sex
Being in somebody’s house unchaperoned for any length of time is, at best, a
mixed message. Home is an intimate place, and coming up to use the bath-
room, have a nightcap, check your machine, or watch a video is ambiguous.
A home-cooked meal is nice, but you had better be willing to be dessert
unless the entire family is gathering for the occasion.
If you’re ready to have sex, a house with a bed is a real comfort. If you’re not
ready to have sex, a house with a bed is either a temptation or a tease.
Careful here.

Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
If you could do it over again . . . ?
I used to do a program in San Francisco in which
people could vote on various questions — yes or
no, pro or con. One day, I asked the question, “If
you knew then what you know now, would you
have waited longer to have sex?”
Fully 93 percent of both men and women
resoundingly responded yes, they would wait!
The reasons varied from “It was too distracting”
to “I hurt too many people” to “I had to sneak
around” to “It committed me too soon to some-
one I really didn’t like” to “I never learned how
to do it right.”
Sobering thought, yes?

Slow Down
Know the song about wanting a man with a slow hand (and we’re not talking
poker here)? Well, almost everything about sex and intimacy can be improved
if it’s slowed down and savored. Anticipation is heady stuff, and your most
erogenous zone is the gray matter between your ears. If you’re not convinced
that going slow has much to recommend it, think about the difference between
gobbling a hamburger at a fast food restaurant and dining out. You get the
point.
Make sure you know what you’re doing and what you want. I know sex wasn’t
designed to be thoughtful: It’s an urgent, fast response, but you’re not an
animal at the mercy of your hormones. You’ve got that big, fancy cortex on
top of all your other organs for a reason.
Not only is it a good idea to go slowly in launching the initial sexual encounter,
but once you’re sexual, going slowly is a great turn-on (think of the good old
days, when waiting until you were married made the wedding, the wedding
night, and sex very special). Even if you decide to be sexual, the longer you
wait and the longer you take, the happier, in general, both of you will be.
No Sleeping Together Until 
You’re Ready for Sex
Think about it this way: You wouldn’t go to a restaurant and then not order
anything. Restaurants are primarily for eating.
You may be rereading this rule to make sure you read it right. After all, why
else would two people who are dating climb into bed together if it isn’t for
sex? Well, I can give you lots of reasons: they’re tired, too cheap to get two
rooms, want a cuddle, are cold or scared — the list goes on. The problem
with all these reasons to get into bed together (and the words “I promise not
to do anything until you’re ready”) is that they sound perfectly reasonable at
the time. But being in bed together is not fair to either of you. If he makes a
pass, he’s an untrustworthy brute, and if he doesn’t make a pass, you’re con-
vinced he’s gay. Once you’ve launched the relationship and you know each
other very well, being in the same bed without either of you wanting sex may
be possible, but the situation is still complicated and needs to be discussed,
which is a lot of hassle if you’re just starting out.
351
Chapter 31: Ten Sexual Commandments of Dating

Don’t Have Unprotected Sex
Oh, puh-leeeze. If I have to explain this to you, you need to put this book
away for a couple of years. You must protect yourself and your partner not
only from sexually transmitted diseases that can ruin or end your life but
from unwanted pregnancy as well.
The only way to be completely protected is to abstain; but if you decide to
have sex, understand that although a condom and a degree of caution is safer
sex (is there really anything even remotely safe about sex? — truly a contra-
diction in terms), the parts of your body that really need protection are your
heart and soul and mind. Make sure you’re aware enough of your emotional
needs and your partner’s emotional needs to be responsible. Otherwise, fan-
tasize, masturbate, and wait.
Women have been worried about getting pregnant since the caves, but men
should worry, too. The idea of having to support and care for a child for the
rest of your life because you were feeling amorous one night and had too
much to drink is a terrifying one. You get a woman pregnant, you’re a father,
ready or not. If you’re not ready, then make sure you use a condom every
time, period (and make sure you put it on and take it off right). Then when
you and your beloved decide to have kids (and legalize your union for the
kids’ sake), you won’t have to worry about any surprises knocking on your
door someday and asking you to take a paternity test and attach your pay-
check. Do you understand me? Good!
Don’t Assume Your Date 
Is Responsible Sexually
Assumptions about sexual responsibility can be literally fatal and at best,
embarrassing. So talk about what you’re about to do and what it means to
both of you. If this conversation seems to get in the way of spontaneity, talk
about it when both of you are dressed, sober, and maybe even in public.
Basically, don’t assume anything at any time if you don’t absolutely have to.
As my used car salesmen taught me when I was writing my dissertation,
“Never assume. It makes an ass of u and me” (Get it? a-s-s-u-m-e). You wouldn’t
assume a gun wasn’t loaded before you pulled the trigger (enough Freudian
imagery there for us all?).
352
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Beware of Back Rubs
I am a sucker for a great back rub, but in a dating situation, if you haven’t
launched yourselves sexually, a tempting back rub has to be viewed as part
of a package with a front rub. In other words, lying down, taking off your
shirt, and letting somebody touch you is pretty darn sexy, wouldn’t you say?
Don’t tease.
If you want sex, a back rub may be a great prelude, but both of you need to
understand that that’s what’s happening. If you want a back rub without sex,
go to one of the storefront, great American back rub places or find a same-sex
masseuse or masseur.
Don’t Confess
Possibly the only behavior more fraught with potential disaster than sex is
talking about previous sexual experiences. At least sex usually feels good and
is fun for both; confession feels good only for the confessor. Blabbing about
your sexual past is a good example of trading off short-term comfort for long-
term pain — not such a terrific idea.
If you want to confess past indiscretions, find a priest or a therapist, not a
date. Thinking that “I’m just being honest” is a terrible reason to inflict past
experiences on a date. Confession is good only for the soul of the sinner, and
it can wreck a perfectly good relationship. If what you want to confide is a
problem, solve it yourself; if it’s guilt, get over it; if it’s bragging, tell your
friends or your diary. Anything else will come back and haunt you. (See
Chapter 20 for advice on what and what not to share.)
If you’re about to do something that would be hard to confess, you may want
to consider not doing it. This isn’t to say you have to pretend that you’ve just
sprung fully armored from the brain of Zeus or that you’re the last vestal virgin
or that you have to lie. It’s time to adopt the Clinton plan: Don’t ask, don’t tell.
Anything you are or aren’t sexually is about here and now. If there is baggage,
find a therapist, find a priest. Not only will confessing add absolutely nothing
positive to your relationship, but it’ll come back to haunt you. Comfort yourself
with the thought that between honesty and duplicity is silence.
Don’t Fake It
Faking interest or orgasms is a short-term solution to a long-term problem
(and simultaneous orgasm is a myth of romance novels and Hollywood). If
you’re faking it, you’re giving out misleading information. Nothing will ever
353
Chapter 31: Ten Sexual Commandments of Dating

change or get better, and sooner or later you’ll be found out, and the if-you’ll-
lie-about-something-as-fundamental-as-this-what-else-will-you-lie-about? ques-
tion rears its ugly head. Sex is about intimacy, and intimacy is about trust,
and trust is about integrity, and integrity is about honesty. And most of us
aren’t all that great at acting. (Remember how your mom always knew when
you were lying? Probably hasn’t changed all that much.)
If you’re enjoying the sex, enjoy it honestly; if it’s not working for you, figure
out what you can do differently or what you can instruct your partner (gently
and tactfully) to do differently.
Don’t Compare
I’m absolutely sure that no one who has the good sense to read this book
would ever be tacky enough to compare sex partners out loud, not to a
friend, not to a locker room acquaintance, and certainly not to a current date.
(If you are tacky enough to do this, please don’t tell me about it — I definitely
don’t want to think of you like that — and clean up your act.)
Equally importantly, don’t compare partners in your own mind. Then was
then; now is now. Some folks have a great backhand, some dance well, and
some tell a great joke. All of us want to be loved and appreciated for more
than the sum of our parts. We want to be loved for the unique creature that
each one of us is. If you don’t want to be compared, don’t compare. Love isn’t
a race to be won; it’s not a competition: It’s an experience to be savored and
nurtured and enjoyed. So no checklists, please. You’ll cheat yourself big-time.
354
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
Male and female sexuality
Sex in humans is much more of a learned
response than in other species. In fact, there’s a
great monograph that describes two primates
raised in captivity who had to be shown stag
films to be able to mate. The conclusion was
that their hearts were in the right place, but that
was about all. But I digress. Female genitalia is
hidden, and the message that society gives
women is to basically ignore any sexual
impulses that women may have but to use sex
to entrap men. Balderdash. Everybody is sexual
from the seventh month of gestation onward. It’s
how society teaches us to feel about our bodies
that affects us. The best way for a woman to
enjoy sex is to trust her partner, know her body,
feel comfortable in her own skin, and be an
active participant in her own life, pleasure, and
sexuality.
Most guys will admit that there are different
kinds of orgasms and that ejaculating and
having an orgasm aren’t always the same thing.
Feeling emotionally involved makes things a lot
more intense. Feeling close to your partner
makes men (and women) much more willing to
please and feel vulnerable. While it’s harder for
men to “fake” it, it’s just as big a mistake. All
God’s children have the right to feel good.

Ten Times Not to Date
In This Chapter
 You’ve lost your job
 You’ve lost your housing
 You’ve lost a friend
 You’ve lost a parent
 You’ve lost your dog
 You’re lost
 You’re married
 You’re still involved
 You’re separated
 You’ve been divorced less than a year
T
he purpose of this list is to let you know when not to begin dating. The
following is a list of ten minefields that are terribly dangerous when
you’re thinking about dating. Anybody in his or her right mind has enough
sense to steer clear of minefields.
You’ve Lost Your Job
Freud said that humans need two things: work and love. The connection
between feeling appreciated and valued for how we behave is obvious, but in
the long run, finding a job is usually a lot easier than finding love, so don’t
decide, “Well, because I’ve just lost my job, wow, more time to date!” or “I can
lose myself in someone’s arms and let him (or her) keep me happy (or pay
the bills or divert me).”
Focus on first things first: Use your time and energy to stabilize yourself and
focus on getting a new job. Although dating and getting a job do have a surpris-
ingly lot in common, money issues aside, losing a job is a confidence buster,
and dating works best when both of you are stable and confident and happy.

You’ve Lost Your Housing
I’m continually surprised by the number of people who are living together
because when they first met, one had just been evicted or lost housing for
some other reason. If you think this means I’m advocating this approach as a
good one, fuhgettaboutit. No way. When these people call me, they’re in trou-
ble. Need is not a good long-term basis for a relationship. The decision to live
with another person is a serious one, should not be entered into lightly, and
should not be based solely on the need to find digs somewhere.
Get an apartment or a roommate and forget about dating until you’ve got a
home base, which gives you one of the basics of life: shelter, from which you
can go forth and deal with the world. Without it, you’re going to feel more
stressed than healthy and useful. Period.
You’ve Lost a Friend
Friendship is a totally different deal than dating (although the best long-term
dating situations are based on liking as well as being turned on by someone),
but any kind of loss is a bad rationale for dating. If your friend moved away,
join a club to stay busy and meet new people. See whether an acquaintance
356
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
Taking a break from dating
If you’re already in a dating situation and any of
the scenarios in this chapter apply to you, things
may get a bit sticky. Just knowing that — and
being able to tell your date what’s going on and
why — may save you some pain. Sometimes,
being honest and taking a break from dating
makes more sense.
You can say, “Look, I really like you, but I have
some stuff going on here that I need to sort out,
and I really don’t want to inflict it on you,” to
which there are several possible responses:
Smart souls will say, “Okay, I understand. Call
me when you’re ready.”
Really smart souls may say, “If it’s okay, I’d like
to check in on you by phone every once in a
while.”
A sweet but somewhat misguided soul may say,
“Feel free to call if talking would help.” (Keep in
mind, though, that recovering from this kind of
unilateral soul searching is really difficult: This
kind of conversation can either bring you closer
or embarrass the daylights out of either or both
of you.)
A sweet, misguided, masochistic soul may say,
“Oh, don’t worry about it. I’ll be here for you,”
having no idea what the person really may
need — because the unhappy soul probably
doesn’t even know at that moment.
Be careful about trying to play shrink. If anybody
knows the pitfalls, it is I, your cheerful author.

can be upgraded to a friend, or write to your friend (you can even go online),
but don’t try to substitute oranges in a recipe that calls for prime rib. Different
issues, and the whole thing won’t taste very good.
You’ve Lost a Parent
One of the predictable traumas of adult life is the death of a parent. Losing a
parent means becoming an orphan, and no matter how old you are when it
happens, it throws you for a loop for a while.
Parents are especially important in the dating landscape because they’re the
first and maybe even most important people from whom we learn to be male
or female. We learn by watching how Mom and Dad act, and we practice by
imitating what they do. Their loss can really touch some basic issues about
being male or female, and all of us need to work those issues out before
taking our act on the road.
Anytime you’re off balance is a time to try to regain that balance without rely-
ing on a stranger as a crutch. Depending so heavily on someone else you
don’t know is just too dangerous when you’re so fragile.
You’ve Lost Your Dog . . .
. . . or cat or parakeet or fish or boa constrictor. In psychology, animals are
called love objects because we give them characteristics that make it easy to
love them and cuddle them and depend on them. But dealing with a pet is dif-
ferent from dealing with a person (no matter how demanding a pet, it can’t
talk, nag, praise, or argue with you or complain to your mom about you), and
it’s important not to confuse the two, even if some people really like being
tickled behind their ears and purr if you scratch their bellies. Dates are not
animals, and animals are not dates. Don’t even go there.
You’re Lost
If you feel your life is chaos and you don’t know who you are or what you
want, there is an enormous temptation to hide. One of the best ways to hide is
to throw yourself into someone else’s life. The problem with this tactic is that
sooner or later, you must get your own life back in order. Putting it off just
means that the problems you’re hiding from are stale (they didn’t go away,
they just got older), and you now have the additional problem of trying to pry
yourself out of the life of someone who thought you were there because you
liked him or her. Sigh.
357
Chapter 32: Ten Times Not to Date

Each individual must steer by his or her own internal compass. While you
may be able to temporarily borrow someone else’s, their compass may be
leading them in a direction different from the one that makes sense to you.
You’re Married
Listen up. Married people don’t date. Let me repeat that. Married. People. Don’t.
Date. If you want to date, don’t marry. If you’re already married, then either
work on your marriage or get out. Complicating a marriage that is obviously
not doing well with another soul is mean, nasty, manipulative, and pointless.
One of the traditional ways married couples deal with the need to flirt, be
appreciated by the opposite sex, and have a bit of social variety is to hang
out with other couples, but sexual exclusivity is part of the marriage con-
tract. If you’re married, give this book to a single friend. If you’re single and
are even thinking about getting involved with someone who is married, ask
yourself why you would want to waste your time with a cheat. Married daters
can be exceptionally charming because they’re not available, but they’re not
very nice; they can use charm as a way of seducing the unwary. Don’t buy it.
When in doubt, ask — and then run for your life.
You’re Still Involved
Dating is about learning who you are and what you want. But dates aren’t
trapezes: You don’t hang onto one until another comes along. In the early
phase of dating, before the two of you decide on exclusivity, it’s perfectly
legitimate to see more than one person as long as you don’t lie about it.
But involvement implies something quite different from casual dating (see
Chapter 22). Even if you feel that you’re in the last phase of dating someone
you’ve been seeing for a while, you’re still better served to chill and get out
of one situation before you launch into another.
Having sex with more than one person you’re dating gets confusing. It’s also
often something that’s difficult about which to be honest. Do you have to tell?
Not necessarily, but don’t lie and don’t imply exclusivity where none exists.
You have the right to do what makes sense to you, but lying demeans you as
well as the person to whom you lie. Lying says that the listener is stupid and
you’re bad. Why bother? If you’re found out, trust gets trashed, even if you
didn’t say you were being monogamous. There are also the nasty little com-
plications like pregnancy, disease, betrayal, and so on.
358
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

You’re Separated
You thought I’d let you get away with this one, huh? Not a chance. Separated
is just another word for married. A separation is like a hole in the donut. It’s
defined by what’s around it, and a marriage is what’s around a separation.
Walking away from a long-term commitment is very hard, but using someone
else to pry you out emotionally simply doesn’t work, and it’s not really very
fair or nice to use another person in that way. I’m sure you’re much too nice
to even think about starting anything on such slippery footing.
You’ve Been Divorced Less Than a Year
I know, the two of you were separated, and you’ve been emotionally out of
there for ages. Yada, yada, yada. It takes time to get over the trauma, the love,
the hate, the guilt, the tears, the sleepless nights, the ex-in-laws, the parents,
the best man . . . the list goes on and on. The best way to be whole and make
sure you don’t repeat the whole thing all over again is to wait one whole cal-
endar year after the divorce becomes final before you begin dating again.
One calendar year, first and most importantly, gives you the time to know
that you can live on your own. You can use the time to figure out how what
seemed so right could go so wrong, so that you don’t have to feel guilty about
it anymore — or feel terrified that it could happen again. A year without
dating doesn’t mean you have to be on house arrest: You can have same-sex
friends, work, work out, take courses, take walks, take seminars, and so on.
This is time you can invest in your future. When the year is up, you’ll have
your confidence and your equilibrium back, and you can be your best self.

Ten Tips to Happy Dating
In This Chapter
 Be realistic
 Be specific
 Take responsibility
 Be active
 Don’t settle
 Reevaluate often
 Write stuff down
 Be creative
 Be aware
 Analyze fear
W
hen you think of dating happily, you may think of spending time with
an interesting and neat person, doing lots of fun and exciting things
together, and connecting intimately. Yet those are only a few of the things
that go into a groovy dating experience. In this chapter are ten more things
that, although they may not pop immediately to mind, are also keys to having
rewarding and fun dating experiences.
Be Realistic
We live in a society in which an artificial need is created to sell everything
from toothpaste to cars to hot dogs. The need that advertisers create is the
need to smell great and look great and be perfect. In short, it’s the need to be
loved, and they convince us that by buying this product — voilá — we will
find true love.

My favorite example of this nonsense is a commercial in which a woman with
perfect teeth, perfect hair, and who’s wearing a beautiful white dress, is being
approached by a handsome stud in a tuxedo. Filmy curtains blow in the back-
ground, a beautiful chandelier throws off flattering light, and violin music fills
the air. As he strides confidently across the room toward her, he loses his bal-
ance, bumping into a table, knocking over the wine goblet, and pulling off the
tablecloth as he — and everything else on the table — goes flying. The ad is
for a carpet stain remover. The creators of this commercial took our most
profound fantasies and turned them on their head. Unfortunately, when it
comes to dating, we often don’t have a slick Madison Avenue dude with a
sense of humor to remind us of the treachery of the romantic ideal: This fan-
tasy is not real, and it’s not life, and it’s not us.
If you’re looking for the perfect date or mate or state, you’re in trouble for
two reasons: First, perfection is unlikely, if not impossible. Second, if a per-
fect person were to exist, he or she would most likely be looking for a perfect
person, too. Yikes! Heaven knows, I’m not perfect, and neither are you.
So ask yourself about your expectations: Are you being reasonable? Are you
asking too much of yourself, too much of your date, or too much of the situa-
tion? Best friends are really helpful in the reality check department, so when
in doubt, it’s okay to say, “Am I being realistic here, or have I overdosed on
romance pills?”
Be Specific
Often, when people talk about the opposite sex, they either go all gooey and
soft focus or become harsh and judgmental. Neither stance is particularly
helpful. Look carefully at the details. Being specific is one of the best ways
not only to problem-solve but to be realistic as well.
Abstractions are almost always trouble. Saying, “This relationship isn’t work-
ing for me,” makes everybody unhappy and anxious. Saying, “It makes me
nervous when you’re more than five minutes late while I’m waiting on a street
corner for you because I once saw a pedestrian hit by a car,” is much less
threatening and much more helpful in terms of offering a problem and solu-
tion. In this approach, you can agree to wait inside, your partner can promise
to be early from now on, or you can get some therapy about the pedestrian
trauma. My point is that specificity gives everybody a place to start with a
minimum of blaming or value judgment.
362
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Take Responsibility
This is a way cool rule for life as well as for dating. Nothing makes people
angrier than the “who me?” routine. All of us make mistakes — sometimes
because we’re thoughtless, sometimes because we’re clueless, often out of
ignorance. But when it’s clear you blew it, even though every instinct is
saying play dumb, accept responsibility: If you’re late, ’fessing up — “I’m late,
I’m sorry, and I didn’t leave enough time” (or “I got caught up and lost track
of the time” or even “You’ve kept me waiting; I thought I’d try payback”) — is
still much better than playing dumb.
Besides, playing dumb is an expensive defense: Think back a few years to
when you got caught with chocolate on your face, and your mom said, “Who
ate the ice cream?” and you said, “I don’t know.” Remember her response? “It
was bad enough you ate the ice cream, but I’m going to punish you twice for
lying.” Ouch. Not taking responsibility when you know ya done it is the mom-
and-chocolate-ice-cream scenario all over again.
On the other hand, if you are genuinely baffled or completely innocent (yeah,
right), saying, “I don’t know what the problem is, but I’m sure it’s my fault
’cause — it always is,” is a particularly odious way of not taking responsibil-
ity by seeming to take it. ’Fess up if you’re sure; think about it if you’re not;
and if you’re genuinely baffled, say, “I feel really dumb, but I truly don’t know.
Are you willing to help me out here?” There really can be honest differences,
and if you’re known as somebody who takes responsibility, folks cut you a lot
more slack than if you’re a slacker.
363
Chapter 33: Ten Tips to Happy Dating
Speaking specifically
When I was working for the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I was asked to evaluate
intellectually challenged citizens and draw up
individual plans for each person that parapro-
fessionals could implement. This assignment
really taught me a lot about being specific. I
learned that saying “the goal here is to help the
person become more self-sufficient” doesn’t
give any clues about where to start or what to
do. Even saying “this person needs to learn to
feed himself” is too abstract. I learned to be
focused in my thinking and task definitions:
“Hold a fork between the thumb and index
finger and extend the forearm from the elbow
while leaning forward from the hips in a
chair seated at a table” is a much more helpful
statement.
Get the point? When I say be specific, I mean
be specific. Don’t talk bodies or faces or noses;
talk about the upper-right quadrant of the right
nostril.

Be Active
In our society, we seem to have become a nation of crybabies and busybod-
ies. We’ve all become professional victims. The best way not to feel victim-
ized is to do something, (almost) anything. Don’t wait for someone to call
you. Either make the call, take a walk, scrub the floor, scrape gum off your
shoes, or jog. Don’t wait for someone else to make your day or make you
happy or get the ball rolling. This is your life, not a dress rehearsal.
Nobody likes to be around someone who has no opinions, no energy, no per-
sonality. Do something and watch the world watch you.
Don’t Settle
A life is a series of compromises — going left when you wanted to go right
because the taxi cut you off, taking the chicken on the buffet table because
the prime rib was all gone, going to the prom with your best friend because
you thought your dream date would turn you down. There’s nothing bad or
wrong about being flexible. The trick is knowing when to compromise and
when to go for it.
To do that, you have to know what’s really important to you, and once you
know that, don’t settle. If you don’t have what you want, make sure you do
know what you want — being both realistic and specific — and then go for it.
You can always reevaluate. What most people regret is not the mistakes they
made but the chances they didn’t take.

Depression and activity
A really cool study, just completed, showed that
even clinically depressed people do a lot better
when they exercise 20 minutes a day. They need
less medication, sleep better, and report feeling
better. If a little exercise each day works for
folks who are really, really unhappy, think how
well it should work for those who are just
romantically challenged. Don’t sit around and
have a pity party (or at least not for more than a
day or two). Do something! You’ll be amazed
how much better you feel and how much better
the relationship works.

Reevaluate Often
Something that made you happy or behavior that pleased you or someone
who rang your chimes once may or may not be in for the long haul. The only
way of knowing the short term from the long term is to be willing to take your
own emotional pulse from time to time.
If you’re happy and you know it, not only clap your hands but enjoy, and if
you have a few extra moments, try to figure out why you’re happy (although,
to be quite honest, most of us don’t know; we just let the good times roll and
rule). But if you’re miserable (or even if there seems to be just a tiny pinch),
for heaven’s sake, take a moment and see whether you can figure out alterna-
tives and understand cause and effect (what makes you feel the way you do).
Don’t waste time blaming; just try to be specific and active and responsible
and problem-solve.
Write Stuff Down
Most human beings have been talking for a lot longer than they’ve been writ-
ing, which is why a blank page seems so intimidating, but when it comes to
being honest and keeping track, writing stuff down is an instant combination

Foreign relations
I was on a beach in Hawaii a couple of years
ago when I ran into two Canadians who I had
met my first day there. I was feeling particularly
vulnerable because I had planned this trip with
a friend who backed out. (Okay, so lots of this
book is based on my personal experience as
well as my professional insight: I’d been stood
up by the guy I was seeing, who had a habit of
calling at the last moment to attend the funeral
of a friend. After six or seven supposed funer-
als of supposed friends, I decided it was unsafe
to be his friend. I digress.) Back to the romantic
getaway for two by myself. . . .
The Canadians had adopted me and vetted an
Austrian count and an Australian health club
owner as appropriate potential escorts for me
in my sad and lonely state. When my fairy god-
fathers saw me on the beach with both their and
my second choice, they took me aside and
asked why I was with the count. I said, Mr.
Aussie hadn’t called me. The guys pointed out
that Mr. Aussie wouldn’t be able to get ahold of
me, so why was I settling for second best?
I decided they were right, made polite apolo-
gies, went in search of my first choice, and had
a great couple of days getting acquainted with
someone who is still my friend to this day. Score
one for my friends from the north. I’ve never for-
gotten them or the lesson.

shortcut and mirror. You don’t have to write an essay or poetry, and no one’s
going to be grading for spelling or punctuation. This is simply your way of
keeping track. (Little girls often begin the habit of writing thoughts around
7 or 8 when an auntie gives them a diary with a lock and little key.)
A log (not a Captain James T. Kirk kind of log, but a feelings log) can be really
useful and helpful to pinpoint important times, beginnings of issues, and
changes in the relationship. It’s a great way to keep us honest and focused,
and as long as you don’t leave it around for someone to find and read, there
is no downside here. A log also is a way of taking responsibility privately so
we can practice before we take it publicly.
Be Creative
You’re not like anybody else on the planet, and neither is your date, so why
do the two of you have to follow anybody else’s rules or precedents about
what you want, how you act, where you go, or how you communicate? If it’s
okay with the two of you — and it’s not illegal — then why not?
I’m not talking necessarily sex here. I’m talking the two of you being original
about how to talk and how to act and finding the courage as well as the fun
to be whoever the two of you are, individually and together. For example, is
strawberry jam a great Valentine’s gift or not? I don’t know. Whether it’s a
great V-day gift depends on how the two of you feel about it. Be willing to
experiment and be your best, most original self.
Of course, this doesn’t mean you have to startle or shock, but you may sur-
prise yourself at how interesting you can be when you follow your own heart.
(And your originality can be a great catalyst to your date’s creativity as well.)
If it works, zowie! If it doesn’t, the two of you can talk about it, figure out why
not, and come up with alternatives — or decide that you’re really not a great
match.
When it comes down to it, isn’t the point to fashion our lives, individually and
together, as something precious and rare and meaningful to each of us?
Be Aware
Somebody is always calling up my program and saying, “Everything was
going really well and then all of a sudden . . . ,” and I say, “Nonsense. You’re
either dealing with a psychopath or somebody who deserves an Academy
366
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Award, or you weren’t paying attention.” Guess which of these three it most
often is. That’s right: You weren’t paying attention.
Socrates said, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” and I say, “The unex-
amined date is a waste of time.” Pay attention to your date and to your own
responses. You don’t have to constantly monitor as though your date were in
dating ICU and liable to expire at any moment, but be willing every once in a
while to step out a bit and see what’s going on. How are you? How does the
date seem to be doing? Are you happy? Is it fun? Are you being attentive? Do
you need more sleep? Are your senses being dulled? Being dense is a tough
way to lead your life and dangerous when you’re dealing with someone else
who wants you tuned in.
Listen up. Look up. Live it up. Love it up.
Analyze Fear
Fear. It’s buried and it’s old and it’s kinda nasty and it’s pretty familiar. If
you’ve followed the advice in each of the preceding sections, you may have
bumped up against a really uncomfortable feeling. Its names range from the
blue meanies to the boogeyman, our demons, our dragons, our baggage. It’s
that part of ourselves that we shield like crazy because we hate it about our-
selves, and it makes us really, really unhappy and scared. It may be that we
fear we’ll be abandoned or that we’re too fat or too stupid or too smart or too
tall or too short or too thin or too fat. Whatever our fear, it’s likely gotten
moldy because it’s been around for so long. It’s often left over from childhood
or adolescence and pops up at the most inconvenient times — like when
we’re trying to let down our guard and feel close to someone and let them
know the true us so we can feel loved.
It is impossible to be completely without fear, and that’s okay: Fear warns us.
After all, it would be stupid to cross the street without looking or do a header
off the Empire State Building. But we can look at our fear, our assumptions,
our anger, our patterns and decide to try to do something different. The
moment we do that, our fear no longer controls us. We’re in charge of our
own life, and paradoxically, these moments are most likely to happen when
we let another person into our intimate life.
There’s a great scene in the movie The Mission with Jeremy Irons and Robert
De Niro, who play Spanish missionaries who have come to South America to
convert the natives. De Niro has brought elaborate carved chairs and tables
and silver chalices and armor and all the things that he felt were necessary,
367
Chapter 33: Ten Tips to Happy Dating

but in the New World, even though he’d tied this stuff up so that he could
carry it easily, the slope is too slippery, and it’s raining, and he has to make a
decision. Are these things from another life important enough to him to hold
on to, even though he won’t be able to keep going and may even have to go
back to where he was, or can he cut them loose and reach his goal? Often in
a relationship, you’re given that opportunity to see your fear, see the things
you feel you need to make you safe and comfortable and realize that they’re
just not working. At that point, you can decide to let them go or to park them
for a while to see whether things work better without them.

xplaining how to make yourself or someone else happy depends on per-
sonality, age, temperament, history, experience, time of the month, phase
of the moon, job security, personal insecurity, commitment, versatility, imagi-
nation, and a gazillion things too numerous to mention but fun to imagine.
This whole book is about understanding yourself and what you want, taking
control and taking chances, getting out into the world and having fun with
another person, and growing. In other words, this book is about nice stuff,
happy stuff — emotionally healthy stuff — except this chapter.
In this chapter, I’m going to show you how to make yourself and somebody
else really, really miserable. “Why?” you ask. “Can’t I do that by myself?” Well,
maybe, but I’m going to make things so obvious that I cheerfully assume you’ll
avoid these pointless and destructive behaviors like the plague and thereby
move a step closer to the really neat things you can do to make yourself and
everyone around you much happier.

Whine
While happiness may or may not be contagious, misery certainly is. If you are
miserable and negative and nasty and can always find something negative to
say about anyone, you’ll find that even the most energetically happy person
gives up on you, gets angry, walks away, or converts to misery — and the
mess doesn’t take very long at all to occur.
If you want misery to ruin your relationship, think to yourself, “Why be miser-
able alone when I can make others miserable, too?” and then show your
misery — don’t keep it bottled up. The hallmark of misery is the whine —
you know, that high-pitched, grating noise you make when your shoes are too
tight, you’re cranky and tired and coming down with a cold, and you want
everyone to know? So whine, whimper, whatever it takes, and for heaven’s
sake, don’t ever be constructive or specific, because somebody might actu-
ally be able to help then.
If you want to be miserable, be as abstract and unpleasant as possible, using
phrases like, “No matter what I do, it’s not enough,” “Why was I born?” (or its
ever-popular cousin, “I wish I were dead”), “That’s okay, even my mother
doesn’t like me,” “Go ahead and leave me; everyone I’ve ever loved has.”
Before you know it, you’ll be alone again with no one to blame but everyone.
Whining doesn’t accomplish anything except aggravate and annoy the people
you’re around. So instead of whining, figure out what’s making you unhappy
and then try to really talk about it. You may be surprised how far real com-
munication can take you.
Blame
Instead of problem solving and figuring out what went wrong so that you can
ensure it doesn’t happen again, assign blame; doing so assures that your date
will fight you, run, or meekly admit that, yes, it is all his or her fault.
Dating will be maximally miserable if you get one whiner and one blamer
together. They can make each other miserable for long periods of time. We
all know at least one married couple like that, don’t we? We know what keeps
them together: mutual misery. We know they had to have gotten their start
somewhere: Dating.
When things don’t go well or as you expected, instead of assigning blame, try
to figure out what went wrong so that it doesn’t happen again.
370
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Compare
Whatever you do, don’t live in the present; living in the present is a good pre-
scription for happiness and therefore contrary to your plans if your goal is
being miserable or spreading misery. Instead, compare your date or yourself
to others. By doing that, you move out of the moment and the intimacy the
two of you are sharing and widen the circle in an unpleasant, judgmental way.
Comparisons are by definition a statement of expectation, and expectations
are the death of serenity. If you’re just beginning to date, you can always com-
pare your date to other people’s dates or your parents or your sibs or your
classmates. Even if your current date compares favorably, it will probably
occur to him or her that sooner or later, he or she is going to suffer by the
comparison, and your date just may get the idea to compare you to someone.
There is a great story told by a world famous journalist who was interviewing
a world famous playboy who was handsome, smart, wealthy, accomplished,
and unmarried. She said, rather rudely actually, “Why is it you’ve never mar-
ried?” He replied, “I was looking for the perfect woman.” “Never found her?”
“Au contraire, I did, but unfortunately she was looking for the perfect man.”
Few of us are perfect. The need to compare self or other is an exercise in futil-
ity and misery that is a glorious waste of time.
Pout
Disagreements inevitably occur between two people who are trying to func-
tion, no matter how temporarily, as a unit. Each has different experiences,
background, expectations, skills, strengths, weaknesses — even different
sexes. The question is, what happens when there’s a problem? One option is
to say nothing and let the problem fester and build and mold. In other words:
Pout.
Why engage in constructive, helpful conversation when you can demonstrate
your unhappiness without taking responsibility by acting sullen, sulking, and
being unwilling to discuss the matter?
Pouting is akin to emotional terrorism: It’s a way to walk away emotionally
while staying in the same room. By not saying what’s wrong and not working
toward a solution, you hold your partner hostage.
371
Chapter 34: Ten Ways to Make You and Your Date Miserable

Holler
Pouters always find hollerers to hang out with. Opposites attract and then
aggravate the daylights out of one another. When it comes to undermining a
relationship, hollering is almost as effective as pouting. The only real advan-
tage is that there is some verbal communication occurring; of course, it
occurs at a decibel level that can be frightening, especially to a pouter.
Hollering is usually saying very loudly, “What about me?!” In the face of hol-
lering, most people shut down (if for no other reason than to save their 
hearing), holler back, get sullen and pout themselves, or walk away.
So to aggravate the situation, avoid constructive conversation, and to scare
the daylights out of anyone who startles easily, shout. Keep in mind that
shouting as an intimidation tool usually works a little better if you can also
make the veins in your neck pop out and your face turn beet red.
Getting angry is normal, okay, and even part of good communication, but
take a deep breath, pretend you’re angry at your boss or the pope, and 
quietly explain what’s vexing you.
Swear
People who holler almost always end up swearing because their noise feeds
on itself and becomes angrier and angrier and more and more incoherent.
Incoherence means the cool words won’t come, so the cuss words emerge.
Cuss words are meant to wound and shock. So forget about trying to solve a
problem or develop an atmosphere of trust in which intimacy can occur, and
cuss up a blue streak. String together one incoherent, objectionable word or
phrase after another until you either end up alone or sputtering for the next
word.
One way to curtail the temptation to swear is for the two of you to draw up a
list of forbidden words and then decide that the first one who uses one of the
words on the list has to pay the other $50 for every swear word, every time. I
guarantee the swearing will either stop very quickly, or somebody is going to
get very rich very quickly — which at least makes the verbal nonsense a little
easier to take.
372
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Say “You Always . . .” 
or “You Never . . .”
If you want the real problem to remain unsolved so that it will come up again
in another fight, say “you always . . .” or “you never . . . .” What makes either
of these phrases so effective at circumventing constructive interaction is that
the other person instantly thinks of a counterexample, and then the two of
you are off on a tangent, and the whole point of the disagreement is lost.
Using “you always . . .” or “you never . . .” is the quickest way to escalate a
disagreement into a war.
Arguments are inevitable, but be specific, stay in the present, and look for
solutions, not blame.
Complain
Complaining is such fun to listen to, dontcha think? It’s especially pleasant if
you complain about your date to people who know him or her — you know,
parents, friends, coworkers. Then you can start gossip and rumors, which
inevitably get back to your date. Of course, you’ll discover that you lose not
only your date but your friends as well. Congratulations. You’ve moved from
misery to abject misery.
Females, you have all cut your eye teeth on chewing on problems and talking
them over, but guys hate the thought that you might be sharing really intimate
things about them with your best friend or sister or mom. The problem is that
you gripe when things aren’t going well, but you feel better when you hang up
the phone, so you give him a call and make up. Then when things are going
well, you don’t have the time or inclination to talk about him as much, so your
mom and sister and friend are left with only the bad stuff and are convinced
you’re dating a nasty combination of Hitler, Jack the Ripper, and the Antichrist.
No wonder they can’t be civil to him. So if you want to make him truly uncom-
fortable, talk about him with people who know him. To push him over the edge,
tell him you’re blabbing and don’t hold back any information from those (like
your mother or sister or very best friend) who you want to like him in the long
run. If you follow this advice, you’ll stress out the people you’re close to and
embarrass your date. In the misery charts, that’s a win-win situation.
It’s best to complain to the person who’s making you unhappy; then there’s
actually some chance something will change. If find yourself overwhelmed by
cowardice, at least complain to someone who doesn’t know and will never
meet your date — ever.
373
Chapter 34: Ten Ways to Make You and Your Date Miserable

Be Passive
Passivity is a very controlling behavior. You control by withholding — words,
love, sex, information, and so on — and it can inspire a frenzy in the more
active partner.
Forget that this is your life, your date, your chance to do something. Don’t
think, don’t talk, don’t act, don’t make mistakes. Keep letting your partner do
everything until he or she gets tired of your doing nothing and move on to
someone else. After all, the best way to feel like a victim is to do nothing.
During part of my career, I spent a lot of time with people who were dying.
The most striking thing that they all had in common, when they were review-
ing their lives with very little time remaining, was what they regretted: It
wasn’t the mistakes they made but the chances they didn’t take. Mistakes are
life’s tuition. Not doing, not risking, is a waste. It makes me think of Helen
Keller, whose philosophy was that either life is daring risk, or it is nothing at
all. Don’t be tortured by what might have been.
Find Fault
Finding fault is sort of the crème de la crème of all the ways to make yourself
and your date miserable: It incorporates blame, whining, being judgmental,
complaining, and if you’re really good at it, you can really be infuriating by
seeming holier-than-thou at the same time.
Ignore the fact that people blossom in the face of praise. Overlook all the
things your date does right and focus on the thing he or she does wrong. Be
on the lookout for mistakes, faux pas, and any other missteps; then make
your date feel downright lousy by keeping the negative feedback coming. It
works only if you’re sincere, but it really does work beautifully.
Catching your date doing something right and well will lighten up the rela-
tionship, your posture, and your life. It makes everything — including you —
more fun.

Appendix A
Specialized Dating Situations
T
he purpose of Dating For Dummies is to give you the basics on dating;
think of it as the foundation for beginning heterosexual interaction —
the alphabet for opposite-sex sentences. But there are a lot of situations that
make the dating experience a bit different. The point of this appendix is to
explain the things that can impact specialized dating situations. To use this
appendix, find your special definition and then integrate those rules with the
basic rules for a custom fit.
You’re Married
If you’re married, you cannot, must not, dare not date — or I’ll haunt you. Got
it? Good. If you don’t want to be married, get a lawyer and a divorce, but under
no circumstances are you allowed to date.
You are married unless you are divorced or widowed. Period. Separated?
Still married. Staying together for the sake of the kids? Still married. Getting
through the holidays? Still married. Waiting for the kids to go off to college
(your collie to die, your parents to move to Florida, your stock option to be
exercised)? Still married. If you’re married, you don’t date, and if your date is
married, don’t date your date.
Not only can you not date one another if either of you is married, but you
have to wait one year until the divorce — let me repeat, the divorce — is final,
one full year. Not the separation, not when sex stopped, not when one got
sick. (If separation was the same as divorce, they would both be the same
word, “sivorce” or “deparation” or something. Two different words mean two
different things.)
If there is any question in your mind as to why waiting a full year is terribly
necessary and important, read Chapter 24, and it will become painfully clear.
I know the temptation is common and strong, but resist. Your relationship
and your soul and your conscience will be the better for it.

There is one exception: If you are married, you may date one and only one
other married person — the person to whom you are married. In fact, not
only is dating your spouse allowed, but it’s encouraged. If you spend the time
and effort to woo one another, to pretend that it’s a first date, to spend the
time and energy that is implied and detailed in the early chapters of this
book, I guarantee your marriage will benefit. If we took a job and then never
worked hard at it or changed any of our work habits and did the same thing
day after day, year after year, we would get bored and fired. So don’t treat
your marriage that way. Date each other if you are married.
One of You Is a Lot Older or Younger
In theory, an age difference is the thing over which you have the least control
in a relationship. It’s the given from day one and shouldn’t matter all that
much. The younger one of the partners, the more any age difference matters.
High school freshmen dating seniors makes parents nervous, and that’s only
three years. The difference between a 15-year-old and an 18-year-old may be
the difference between a jail sentence, whereas the difference between a 70-
year-old and a 73-year-old is irrelevant, so part of the issue with age is the
starting point.
The issues between age-challenged partners fall into six distinct categories.
376
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
The undivorced
This is an increasingly growing category of
people who are not living together, but not yet
divorced. If you haven’t already done so, read
Chapter 32 on dating no-no’s. I don’t care if your
prospective date has been separated for
decades; the person is still not divorced, and
believe me, there’s a reason. Do you really need
the aggravation of finding out why?
A lot of folks who are really commitment-shy
find the limbo of separated but not divorced
quite comfortable because it means they are
unable to commit to someone new — “I’m not
able to marry you because technically, I’m still
married.” Do you really want to take up with
someone who is unable to fish or cut bait, either
be married or be divorced? Not a great idea and
often a great recipe for heartache down the
road.

Tradition and actuarial tables
Traditionally, in our society and many others, older men marry younger
women, which perpetuates the daddy school of relationships — that a man
should be older, wiser, smarter, better educated, stronger, more powerful,
richer, and, in general, higher on the food chain.
As women act more responsible and mature, these distinctions become less
relevant and politically viable, but the tradition remains. There is a wonderful
movie called Harold and Maude in which an 80-year-old Ruth Gordon is pur-
sued by an amorous 18-year-old Bud Cort. No, that wasn’t a typo. The woman
is 80; her suitor, 18. The movie was made as satire to demonstrate how rigid
our rules are for dating, and it’s as relevant today as when it was made more
than 25 years ago (rent it on video; you’ll love it).
Movies and tradition aside, age can and does make a difference. If we all
mated on a logical basis, women would marry men at least seven to ten years
younger so that everybody would end up living their lives out together since
men’s life expectancy is still that much less than women’s.
Sexual viability
One of the major drawbacks of large age differences deals with the age-old
problem of childbearing years. An older woman who is through childbearing
with a younger man who decides he wants children is going to create chaos,
as is a younger woman who wants children with an older man who doesn’t.
377
Appendix A: Specialized Dating Situations
Tradition, tradition: “I do” (and “I don’t”)
The divorce rate has remained steady at around
40 percent (the 50 percent statistic was a com-
putational error that was admitted in 2005
because it divided the number of marriages by
the number of divorces without taking popula-
tion fluctuations into account), but folks are still
marrying like crazy — at a rate of two and a half
million per year in the United States. Either way,
the numbers have remained fairly constant for
the last several decades.
People are marrying later: The average age for
a man’s first marriage is 27; for women it is 24.
The average age of remarriage after divorce is
42 for men and 39 for women.

Since we know that men can procreate until their last rattly little breath, and
women for the years between about 13 and 50, men who are interested in
procreating should choose women in this age bracket. Of course, most states
appropriately frown on dating between adults and children, so if we wipe out
the lower end of the spectrum up to 18 or so, we’re talking viable dating part-
ners between the ages of 18 and 50. Biologically we know that birth defects
are more common at both ends of the spectrum, the very young and the very
old eggs (not women, just eggs), so we’re talking 20 to 40 here, more or less.
Many men on second marriages decide that they can trade a 40-year-old in
for the proverbial two 20-year-olds, which makes some biological sense, but a
40-year-old man with a 20-year-old woman will be a 60-year-old man with a 40-
year-old wife, and if you go on to the next section, you will see the potential
problem with that formula.
Sexual compatibility
Sexually, men are at their peak at 18, women around 40 or so. So if sexual
compatibility were the issue, women should marry significantly younger men.
A woman named Anne Cummings, known as the Randy Granny (a Brit no
less), actually advocates this kind of pairing — although not necessarily 
marriage — so that young men can learn about sex from an experienced part-
ner who is less likely to get pregnant and more likely to be able to be sensible
rather than lust driven.
If sex were all there was to it, maybe. (In case you’re gasping for breath here,
remember that a 40-year-old man with an 18-year-old woman would be con-
sidered a stud.) Beyond sex is a wider look at biology.
Health
These days, when people are taking better care of themselves and living
longer and more productive lives, the idea of an age difference resulting in
obligatory nursing duties at the end of one partner’s life has diminished. I
refuse to deal with the idea of serial marriages here, the idea that you marry
one person for one stage of your life and another for another. Since none of
us is able to see the future, in theory, it is possible that the older person in a
relationship may outlive the younger, but it is wise to at least consider issues
of health, energy, and life stages when dating.
378
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Common interests
One of the often overlooked issues of major age differences is what the two of
you have in common, not only in terms of life experiences, but friends, per-
spectives, and whether one of you thinks that the Beatles are bugs or that
Nine Inch Nails refers to a Chinese emperor’s hands.
These differences at the outset of a relationship can seem charming and fun
and don’t have to be divisive if the two of you can find some areas of commu-
nality to share that are likely to last the length of the relationship. But be
aware of pitfalls that can be predicted but that aren’t always initially obvious.
I know one couple with major age differences who ran into trouble when he
retired and wanted to play and she was just hitting her career peak and
wanted to spend a lot of time at work.
Personal preference
Issues of control and crushes on mommy figures or daddy figures are going
to enter into the age equation. Obviously, all other things being equal, simi-
larity of ages probably makes the most sense, but all other things are never
equal. People are as individual as snowflakes and likely to be just as flaky
when it comes to matters of the heart. Be aware of the advantages and dis-
advantages, the potential fun stuff and pitfalls of major differences in birth
years. If one of you is ten or more years older, you’re talking half a generation
here, but at 80 who cares? At 18, everyone will.
Fortunately — or maybe unfortunately — we don’t fall in love with birth cer-
tificates but with flesh and blood individuals. If you’re looking to date some-
one who is significantly older or younger than you are, ask yourself why and
does it make any long-term sense. Are you looking to shock or advertise, brag
or control? As long as you know what you’re doing, you’ll get no argument
from me, but make sure you’ve taken your own emotional pulse here; I don’t
care how old you are.
You’re Different
In theory, the more similar you are, the more you have in common and the
easier the relationship, assuming you can avoid competition. I view relation-
ships as Velcro: The more points of contact that the two of you have with one
another, the more likely the relationship is to survive the sort of storm-tossed
379
Appendix A: Specialized Dating Situations

seas of the tempest of life together. The more points of contact, religion, eth-
nicity, education, social class, and community of interests, the more likely the
relationship will survive. Does this mean that you have to date only people
who have the same religion, ethnicity, social status, education, or income you
do? Of course not. But it means that you need to be aware of the differences,
the importance, and the ramifications of the differences if the two of you are
going to survive together.
Some foolish souls believe that dating is all about soul mates. You’ve undoubt-
edly figured out that I am certainly not one of them. Working on the assump-
tion that opposites attract and they aggravate the daylights out of one another,
I explore some of the more common differences. This is one area that may be
obvious or subtle, clear or obscure, depending on your own convictions.
Religion
In theory, in the early stages of dating, religion can be finessed and therefore
can be benign, especially if you both assumed the relationship was pretty
casual. But as the two of you get to know each other better and begin think-
ing on a long-term basis, religious differences may begin to be disruptive.
First, let’s be painfully honest. If you feel strongly that you will absolutely not
marry outside of your religion, do not date outside of your religion! The heart
often has its own rhythms and paths and doesn’t really understand casual
dating. So if you are absolutely certain that you will not marry someone of
another religion, please don’t date outside of your religion.
On the other hand, if you have a preference but no strong commitment and
are willing to entertain long-term involvement with someone practicing
another faith, try taking turns going to each other’s synagogue or mosque or
church, take turns sleeping in while the other trots off to services, or sched-
ule golf dates or brunch while your friend is in synagogue. If the two of you
can tolerate compromise while dating, you may be able to do so in the future,
until at least the wedding or children require more clarity.
You can and should discuss religious differences instead of making the
assumption that the differences will go away. Depending on how important
religion is to you or your date, there are multiple possibilities. If your two reli-
gions are not far apart, you may want to experience each other’s religious
customs and festivals as a pleasant part of getting to know one another. Or
maybe you’ll find a third mutually accepted religion. On the other hand, you
may find absolutely no room for compromise — meaning that neither one of
you will convert (actually or informally) or attend the other’s place of wor-
ship. Even if the two of you are relaxed about your religious differences,
remember that your parents may or may not be as open minded, so be pre-
pared to explain the situation to them.

Ethnicity
Living in a country that prides itself on being a melting pot means that differ-
ent ethnicities are common almost everywhere you go — reflected in jokes,
sitcoms, and songs: the Irish man and the Italian woman, the French man and
the German woman, all the way back to Pocahontas and John Smith. The
Internet, colleges, big cities, and dating bars are all venues in which different
ethnicities can meet, greet, and hook up. Again if you’re certain that you’re
unwilling to marry outside your tribe, do yourself and everyone else a favor
and don’t convince yourself that it’s okay to date but not marry outside of
your own ethnic group. This is a prescription for heartache for all concerned,
including a whole lot of problems with your parents.
The lure of the exotic may be initially attractive, but don’t overlook the poten-
tial fallouts, including traditions and inborn racial conflict, because even
though the two of you may feel very much in love, the people who are in your
sphere of influence (your family, friends, neighborhood, grandparents and
country of origin) are going to influence you. To what extent is not entirely
obvious, but it is something to be aware of.
We were talking about differences that you were born with that you may take
for granted; the next three issues that I’m going to talk about are ones that
you achieve.
Social status
I know that the United States pretends that it has no class system. If you
believe that, I have a bridge to sell you. The good news about class in this
society is that it doesn’t go back very far, probably only a couple of hundred
years, opposed to other countries where it goes back thousands of years.
The idea that somebody comes from a completely different background
socioeconomically than you do and has been in that situation for generation
after generation very well may influence how you view friendships, vacation,
money, child rearing, naming of your children, and traditions. The notion that
money is the great leveler — even more so than love — is the stuff of media
pipe dreams, but the notion doesn’t work very well once the cameras stop
rolling. However, be aware that people have all sorts of different expectations
depending on their socioeconomic background. I am not suggesting that
people from different socioeconomic backgrounds not marry, but understand
that there are going to be repercussions, perhaps within the relationship
eventually, and certainly within the general society. I have no particular
reason to uphold the social order by making sure that people of a certain
socioeconomic class marry only one another. But be aware that there are dif-
ferent expectations including whether it’s true love or greed, the ability to fit
in, community acceptance, being snubbed at Thanksgiving.

Appendix A: Specialized Dating Situations

Education
As a radio psychologist, I often remind callers that traditionally American
women marry men who are father figures: older, wiser, taller, richer, and
better educated than they are. But that is changing, and even though it is the
social norm now, historically it certainly has created some problems along
the way, with men feeling that they outgrew their wives, even those wives
who may have put them through school.
Although more subtle than race, religion, or age, differences in education in
the long run may be something that are divisive because one of you is going to
feel inferior to the other, and that inferiority may make you feel defensive or
angry or argumentative. Certainly the nice thing about living in this country is
that education is something that is available. Don’t misunderstand. As a seri-
ously educated woman, I am a great fan of education, but face it: Some really
smart people aren’t well educated, so having matching degrees isn’t necessar-
ily a requirement for compatibility. The respect you have for one another’s
intelligence is part of the equation, but your friends and associates can also
complicate things as well. I have a friend who is a lawyer, whose boyfriend is a
high school dropout. They’re having massive problems, not within the rela-
tionship itself but because he refuses to accompany her anywhere and keeps
referring to her friends as “those lawyer jerks,” who are in fact her friends. He
feels intimidated and defensive, which translates into rudeness and unpleas-
antness toward them, and in return she is defensive. This difference is defi-
nitely one of those things that can undermine a relationship.
Income
Our society has been set up to accept the fact that as men got wealthier, they
could get more beautiful — not necessarily brighter, but more beautiful —
younger women. As women have entered the work force and become more
successful, the fact that a woman earns more than her partner is no longer
remarkable. We know that while these well-heeled women may be thought of
as desirable and sexy while dating, once married, the relationship can be
threatened by the very financial discrepancy that was enchanting during
courtship. This is much more disruptive than the converse, which is much
more in line with the expectation that the man provides for the woman. When
the woman makes more money, the man may initially feel unmanly, which will
result in problems in the bedroom as well as the kitchen, living room, and
garden and may lead to arguments due to his need to “prove” himself. I’m not
suggesting that women hide their income or their power, especially in second
marriages in which women have accumulated, through hard work, inheri-
tance, or a divorce settlement, vast sums of money. That’s why prenups were
invented. If the two of you have a lot of positive things going for you, a differ-
ence in income doesn’t have to be destructive, but it will always be disruptive.
Does this mean women are limited to guys who currently or will eventually
382
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

out-earn them? Absolutely not, but it means the two of you need to be aware
of the long-term turbulence and even the short-term upset that this inadver-
tent challenging of the social norm offers.
You’re Gay
I am one of those people who thinks that we can and should be defined on
the totality of our being rather than our race or hair color or height or sex
or religion. I believe that all of us would have much easier lives if we could
choose who would turn us on (the person who is nice and is crazy about us,
our next-door neighbor, our mom’s best friend’s offspring, the boss’s son or
daughter, our best friend). Unfortunately, that’s not how sex works. We can
choose our behavior, not our feelings. It has always seemed unnecessarily
limiting to define a person’s entire life on the basis of who turns them on. I
still opt for sex as being a private behavior, and in the long run, I care more
about a person’s manners or breath than I do about their sexual preference
unless they happen to turn me on.
One of the assumptions of the book is that you are straight, that is, hetero-
sexual. I made this assumption for two reasons: First, statistically most
people are heterosexual, and my aim was to reach the widest possible audi-
ence. Second, gays and straights face the same issues with respect to dating.
In my years as a psychologist both on and off the air, I have dealt with lots of
folks who were in or out of the closet, gay or straight, and what I am struck
by is the similarities in their dating problems, not the differences. If you are a
gay person reading this book and feel that something I have said as a univer-
sal statement doesn’t apply to you because you’re gay, please write and let
me know. I may include it in a future edition or write a new book or explain to
you why I disagree.
My only real warning here is know thyself. If you’re gay, don’t date straight
people, and if you’re straight, don’t date someone who’s gay. You’re both just
asking for heartache, and there are enough disappointments in life without a
need to go out of your way to ask for that kind of trouble.
If you’re muttering, “What about bi’s?” I would say, get a therapist or a piece
of paper or a mirror and get your act together and decide who you are and
what you want. Wanting it all is okay; trying to have it all is often both greedy
and futile. Sometimes you have to decide the real you, chocolate or vanilla,
Christian or Jew, New York or California (all of which you can change), male
or female (which can be changed with great difficulty), or straight or gay, a
preordained biological orientation like curly hair or left-handedness that you
can’t change.

Appendix A: Specialized Dating Situations

You’re in a Long-Distance Relationship
You meet someone on vacation or at a friend’s wedding, and it’s instant fire-
works. Will it work? Maybe, maybe not. But if you’re more than an hour away
and see each other less than a couple of times a month, you’re talking fan-
tasy. Long-distance relationships can certainly be fun but shouldn’t be con-
fused with a reality-based relationship, which is the only way to have sanity
in your love life.
Sometimes a couple who has been together for a long time has to be apart for
a specified length of time: One has to finish school, a military commitment
has to be fulfilled, a job transfer looms. If the two of you have been together
for a year or more, you may be able to sustain the relationship over a period
of certainly not more than a year (otherwise, you will have been apart longer
than together, and people change over a period of a year). Work out the
ground rules (basically, don’t ask and don’t tell about other social engage-
ments, and don’t commit to one another until the end of the separation).
If you’ve been together six months to a year, you’re best served to believe in
fate. Plan to get together at the end of the separation and see what’s what.
But a lot of visits, if they’re less than weekly, are likely to prolong the agony
without offering much in return.
If you’re sexual, you’re both likely to feel used and spend most of the time in
bed — without acknowledging how both of you are growing and changing.
Relationships that get stuck like a bug in amber are quite brittle. If you’re not
having sex, it will be easier to maintain the distance, but what about the inti-
macy? In general, lots of time apart is hard on a relationship. It doesn’t mean
you’re doomed, but it means things will be and feel different when you
reunite. Why not start over then, without ghosts and baggage, secrets or lies,
and see where both of you are rather than have to finesse or pretend?
You’re Involved in an Office Romance
Americans believe in the M.A.S.H. philosophy of life, which suggests that we
can have all of our goodies in one place: love, family, friends, work, rivalries,
food, housing, recreation, flirtations. Nonsense. This is a TV show that hasn’t
even had original episodes since 1983. While there is a certain efficiency to
the idea of finding someone to love at work (think of how much you’ll have in
common), what is most likely is that one or both of you will lose your jobs.
Work is about competence, and dating is about compatibility. They have very
little to do with one another, and if you think no one will know, think of how
obvious it was when that secretary over in Accounting was having an affair
with his boss. Everybody knows. If for no other reason, keeping your work
and love life separate is a good idea so that, if one goes sour, you can throw
384
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

yourself into the other. If you’ve got the hots for someone at work, wait until
one of you leaves or transfers, and trade phone numbers at the going-away
party, unless it would make it a long-distance relationship. (And if that’s the
case, just confess your crush, wax nostalgic, and chalk the whole thing up to
what might have been until one of you moves back into the area.)
You’re a Single Parent
Nowadays, nearly two-thirds of all children are being raised in single-parent
households, which means there are a lot of parents dating. The number of
single mothers (9.8 million) has remained constant (84 percent of children
living with one parent are living with mom), while the number of single fathers
is growing: Men now comprise one-sixth of the nation’s single parents.
As if dating weren’t complicated enough, having your child ask you what time
you’re going to be home adds agony to embarrassment. By the way, what
time do you plan to be home?
Let me make one thing absolutely clear: Young kids don’t get dating, and even
older ones don’t when it comes to a parent. Trying to combine parenting with
early stage dating is like walking a tightrope while wrestling a dolphin: highly
slippery, inadvisable, and just plain dangerous. Take a look at the possibilities:
You like your date, your date likes you, the kids hate your date: Problem.
You like your date, your date likes you, the kids love your date: Problem
(believe it or not).
You like your date, your date hates you, the kids hate your date: No problem.
You like your date, your date hates you, the kids love your date: Problem.
You like your date, your date likes you, your date hates your kids: Problem.
You like your date, your date hates you, your date loves the kids: Big problem.
You hate your date, your dates likes you, the kids hate your date: No problem.
You hate your date, your date hates you, the kids hate your date: No problem.
You hate your date, your date hates you, the kids love your date: Medium-
sized problem.
I think those are all the possibilities, but the point is that the only times kids
and dating aren’t a problem is when everybody hates everybody. And best-
case scenario — when there is a genuine love-fest going on — can still be
385
Appendix A: Specialized Dating Situations

trouble, since this book only covers the first six to nine months of dating and
lots of things change. I haven’t even mentioned trouble with exes and the
confused roles between dating and parenting for you.
It’s a common problem that’s not going to go away, but you are well advised
to keep your kids and your dates separate until you’re sure of your date,
which takes awhile.
 Introducing a date too soon can make kids either clingy or anxious or
both, and unhappy kids do a lot of acting out, which is psycho-babble for
acting like creeps: hanging up when your date calls, telling your ex, hit-
ting, crying, clinging, telling the teacher your date hit you or the child or
kicked the dog. . . . You get the point.
 Understand, kids get attached and don’t really get hanging out for awhile
to see how things work.
 The adults need time to see if they’re strong enough to be together
before they test the do-the-kids-like-me waters.
 Adult sexuality can be really confusing for kids of any age (do you like
the idea of your parents “doing it”? — and look at how old you are).
This doesn’t mean you have to be celibate or put yourself on house arrest
until the kids are married, but you do have to be discreet and really good at
juggling time and responsibilities, and have reliable baby-sitters at the ready.
You’re Dating Your Best Friend’s Ex
You and your best friend share lots of secrets and have lots in common, but
an ex shouldn’t be one of them. I don’t advise dating your best friend’s ex
unless it’s been a long, long time, and even then, I guarantee your friend is
going to feel you’re being disloyal.
The Everly Brothers had a song about bird dogging (which is dating your
friend’s date), and the song, not the concept, was a big hit. I know it makes
some kind of logical sense. After all, you and your friend do share a similar
sense of humor, a fondness for James Bond flicks, and a willingness to cover
for each other when necessary, but sharing a love interest, even serially, only
works in Hollywood movies, and even Hollywood admits it can get pretty
sticky.
You don’t have to believe me. Just think about how you’d feel if your best
friend started dating one of your exes. Are they talking about you? Comparing
notes? What if you come in second? If nothing else, if your friend starts dating
your ex, you’ll either end up saying, “See, I told you so” or feeling that your
friend has something you don’t . . . like your ex.
386
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

If you’re bound and determined to date your friend’s ex:
 Wait at least a year or so after the break-up. Any earlier, you’re talking
rebound: You’ll lose a date, a friend, and your mind.
 Don’t ask permission. The first date can be kept quiet (after all, who
knows how things will go?), but if it seems to have some potential, tell,
don’t ask. Just explain that you bumped into one another and plan to go
out for coffee (you can finesse that first date), but keep the details to
yourself whether it’s going very well or very badly.
 Ask yourself, “Is it worth the friendship?” That will very likely be the
cost.
You’re Dating Your Relative’s Ex
This is just a specialized and potentially even more toxic case of dating a best
friend’s ex. I actually know a man who married the sister of his girlfriend of
seven years. You can imagine family Thanksgivings are more than a little
strained. Again, if the two of you feel star-crossed, at least wait a while, and
then don’t share the details but do tell the relative before they find out via
the family grapevine. If at all possible, avoid this plight. If you can’t avoid it,
make sure that your motives are pure, and you’re not acting out of some
ancient feud or competition.
You’re a Senior
As we get older and wiser, dating should get easier, but I’m not sure it ever
really does. If you’re a senior (65 or older), this book may be particularly
useful to figure out what’s changed and what’s the same old story.
If you’re divorced, it’s a good idea to keep your kids in the dark for as long as
possible. Don’t wait until the wedding or the funeral, but reading the section
on single parent dating applies regardless of the age of the “child.”
If you’re widowed, don’t be surprised to find your offspring fairly resistant to a
new date. When it comes to our parents, we’re kinda frozen in amber. If Mom
and Dad can’t be together, then the survivor can be a living monument to how
things used to be. Besides, if Mom or Dad is dating, they may be having sex . . .
yech. . . .
If you’ve never been married, ask yourself why not and what you’re looking
for now (see Part I for information on how to find out about yourself and
what you want).
387
Appendix A: Specialized Dating Situations

There are several huge advantages to senior dating:
 Women don’t have to worry about getting pregnant.
 Men don’t have to worry about borrowing the family car.
 You don’t have to ask your parents what time you have to be home
(although you may end up answering to your kids).
 You don’t have to worry about your braces locking when you kiss
(although you may have to worry about your canes knocking).
 Long-term commitment has a whole different meaning.
 You can shop together for eternal housing — a really long-term 
commitment.
 You don’t have to worry what religion to raise the kids in.
388
Dating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Serial dating
How people date has changed radically through
the years. Chaperones and arranged marriages
are things of the past. Dating a number of people
simultaneously until you could focus on one has
become much less popular due to time involve-
ment and sexual issues focusing on easily trans-
mittable and potentially fatal diseases.
The idea of dating one person for awhile until
you either marry or find a reason to move on has
become much more common than at any other
time in human history. While having some obvi-
ous health advantages, serial dating has much
more room for intensity that can be difficult in
the early days of getting to know someone,
lethargy about moving on when faced with the
daunting task of starting over, and mixed and
incompatible messages about the future of any
particular situation.
If I ran the dating world, I would have males and
females hang out in groups for long periods of
time without pairing off. Once the pairings
began, I would encourage multiple pairings (not
necessarily sexual) to allow knowledge of each
other as well as self to proceed with little pres-
sure to “decide.” Because of the emphasis on
commitment (prematurely as far as I’m con-
cerned), if things aren’t going swimmingly, there
is a tendency to move on to the next relationship
rather than the next stage of a relationship or to
remain in a relationship that has become static,
because moving on is not possible and moving
out seems too scary and uncertain.
Serial dating is moving on to the next person
rather than the next stage. Simultaneous dating
allows more time with less intensity to explore
who each of you is and what each of you wants
as long as the relationships are not sexual until
both partners are prepared for commitment and
exclusivity. This more restrained approach
allows for self-awareness, friendship, trust, and
compatibility to precede sexual involvement.

Catch Phrases
A
t one time or another in your dating life, you’re gonna hear a line. It may
not be, “Come here often?” or “Where have you been all my life?” but it’s
going to be some sort of catch phrase that, upon translation, means more (or
less) than meets the ear. Following are phrases that should set off warning
bells and whistles. I’m not saying you need to immediately dump the date
who dares toss you a line, but it is helpful to know what he or she may be
really trying to tell you. These (sort of) tongue-in-cheek translations do just
that so that you can keep your perspective, as well as your sense of humor,
while you’re out on a date. Make sure you never succumb to saying any such
trite phrase yourself. They only blanket a number of complicated meanings.
When in doubt — go for accuracy, not smoothness.
