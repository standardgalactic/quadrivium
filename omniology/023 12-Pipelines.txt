Data pipelines (Pulling)
data consumer
(sink)
pull
filter
pull
transform
pull
data source
(producer)
We've seen this before
à use yield and iteration to pull data through the pipeline
consumer
iterate filter_data()
write data to file
filter_data
iterate parse_data()
yield select rows only
parse_data
iterate read_data()
transform data
yield row
read_data
yield row
pull

data source
push
push
transformer
filter
push
consumer
(producer)
(sink)
generate integers
push
square number
