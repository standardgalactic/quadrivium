Preface
Preface
“Essential Electrodynamics” and my previous book “Essential Electromagnetism” (also pub-
lished by Ventus Publishing ApS) are intended to be resources for students taking electromag-
netism courses while pursuing undergraduate studies in physics and engineering. Due to limited
space available in this series, it is not possible to go into the material in great depth, so I have
attempted to encapsulate what I consider to be the essentials. This book does not aim to replace
existing textbooks on these topics of which there are many excellent examples, several of which
are listed in the bibliography. Nevertheless, if appropriately supplemented, this book and my
other book “Essential Electromagnetism” could together serve as a textbook for 2nd and 3rd
year electromagnetism courses at Australian and British universities, or for junior/senior level
electromagnetism courses at American universities/colleges.
The book assumes a working knowledge of partial diﬀerential equations, vectors and vector cal-
culus as would normally be acquired in mathematics courses taken by physics and engineering
students. It also assumes knowledge of electromagnetism at the level of “Essential Electro-
magnetism”, which also contains very brief introductions to vectors, vector calculus and index
notation. Some of the mathematical derivations have been relegated to the appendices, and
some of those are carried out using index notation, but elsewhere in the book manipulation of
equations involving vector diﬀerential calculus is done using standard vector calculus identities
given in the appendices.
“Essential Electrodynamics” starts with the electromotive force and Faraday’s law, the displace-
ment current, Maxwell’s equations and conservation laws. It then discusses the wave equation,
electromagnetic waves on lossless transmission lines, in empty space, and in linear dielectrics
(including reﬂection and transmission at an interface).
This is followed by electromagnetic
waves in dispersive media including dielectrics, conductors and diﬀuse plasmas, as well as in
waveguides. The book ends with radiation and scattering, using ﬁrst an heuristic approach to
derive Larmor’s formula, and then apply it to simple problems before taking up a more formal
approach using the retarded potentials in the far zone to discuss antenna radiation.
Each chapter is followed by several exercise problems, and solutions to these problems are pub-
lished separately by Ventus as “Essential Electrodynamics - Solutions”. I suggest you attempt
these exercises before looking at the solutions.
I hope you ﬁnd this book useful. If you ﬁnd typos or errors I would appreciate you letting me
know so that I can ﬁx them in the next edition. Suggestions for improvement are also welcome

1.1
Electro-motive force
The electro-motive force (abbreviation emf, symbol E, unit V ) is what drives a current around
a circuit. Examples of sources of emf include batteries, piezoelectric crystals, solar cells and
electrical generators (alternators and dynamos). In electrical generators an engine fuelled, for
example by coal, oil or nuclear ﬁssion, or a water turbine in a hydroelectric plant or a wind
turbine in a wind farm, moves conductors through a magnetic ﬁeld to produce electricity.
The purpose of a source of emf is to maintain a potential diﬀerence across its terminals. Within
a source of emf there is a non-conservative “electro-motive” force FEM acting on positive charges
and pushing them towards the positive terminal “A”, and on negative charges pushing them
towards the negative terminal “B” (see Fig. 1.1a). Integrating the electro-motive force per unit
charge EEM = FEM/q from the negative terminal through the source of emf to the positive
terminal gives the emf,
E =

Figure 1.1: (a) Source of emf: inside the source the electro-motive “force” pushes positive
charge towards the positive terminal; outside the source the electro-motive “force” is zero and
the electrostatic force pushes positive charge towards the negative terminal. (b) Motional emf:
the circuit is pulled to the right at constant velocity v through a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B
(pointing into the page) which causes current I to ﬂow.
The electro-motive force exists only inside the source of emf. Within the source it is in the
opposite direction to the (conservative) electrostatic force qEES which pushes positive charges
away from the positive terminal, and the electro-motive and the electrostatic forces cancel each

other out. Thus, if we integrate the vector sum of the two forces per unit charge, Etotal =
EEM + EES around a closed loop from the negative terminal through the source of emf to the
positive terminal then outside the source back to the negative terminal we also get the emf
because EEM = 0 outside the source and
∮
EES · dr = 0, and so
E =

Etotal · dr

From now I shall represent Etotal simply by E and remember it is in general the vector sum of
the electrostatic ﬁeld and the non-conservative electric ﬁeld associated with a source of emf.

which is entirely due to section D–C as other parts of the wire either have v × B · dr = 0
(B–D and C–A) or are outside the magnetic ﬁeld region. The emf drives a current through the
resistor which dissipates as heat at a rate E2/R equal to the work done by someone pulling the
wire through the magnetic ﬁeld (assuming 100% eﬃciency). This is the basic principle behind
electrical generators.
1.1.2
Electromagnetic induction and Faraday's law
English physicist and chemist Michael Faraday (1791–1867) discovered that the emf produced
was proportional to the rate of change of magnetic ﬂux through the circuit. For the circuit
shown in Fig. 1.1(b) the magnetic ﬂux through the circuit is
ΦB
=
∫
S
B · dS
=
Byx.
(1.4)
As the loop moves, the ﬂux decreases:
dΦB
dt
=
Bydx
dt
=
−Byv.
(1.5)
Apart from the sign (because x is decreasing) this is just the emf we found before,
∴
E = −dΦB
dt .
(1.6)
Faraday conducted experiments of the type shown in Fig. 1.1(b), as well as experiments keeping
the circuit ﬁxed and moving the magnet instead of the circuit, and experiments in which the
circuit was ﬁxed but the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld was varied. In all cases a current ﬂowed,
and the emf was described by Faraday’s law (Eq. 1.6) which is sometimes called the universal
ﬂux law, i.e. a changing magnetic ﬂux induces an emf proportional to its rate of change. The
minus sign is there because induced currents produce a magnetic ﬁeld which tends to oppose
the change in magnetic ﬂux (Lenz’ law, after Russian physicist Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz
1804–1865) – nature resists change!

Electrodynamics and conservation laws
It remained a puzzle why this same formula (Eq. 1.6) applied to the three quite diﬀerent types
of experiment carried out by Faraday, until Einstein developed his special theory of relativity.
We can write Faraday’s law as
∮
Γ
E · dr = −d
dt
∫
S
B · dS = −
∫
S
∂B
∂t · dS
(1.7)
where loop Γ bounds surface S. But, using Stokes’ theorem
∮
Γ
E · dr =
∫
S
(∇× E) · dS,
(1.8)
we obtain Faraday’s law in diﬀerential form
∇× E = −∂B
∂t .
(1.9)
We see that a changing magnetic ﬁeld produces an induced electric ﬁeld which has ∇× E as
above and ∇· E = 0. This is in contrast to the electrostatic ﬁeld for which ∇× E = 0 and
∇· E = ρ/ε0 — note that in the static case, i.e. ∂B/∂t = 0, we have ∇× E = 0 as expected.
1.1.3
Faraday's law in terms of the vector potential
The magnetic ﬂux through a surface S bounded by closed curve Γ is
ΦB
≡
∫
S
B(r) · dS =
∫
S
∇× A(r) · dS =
∮
Γ
A(r) · dr,
where we have used Stokes’ theorem to get the ﬁnal result above. Hence,
∮
Γ
E · dr = −d
dt
∫
S
B · dS = −d
dt
∮
Γ
A · dr = −
∮
Γ
∂A
∂t · dr
(1.10)
and we can write Faraday’s law in terms of the vector potential
E = −∂A
∂t .

Hence, the total electric ﬁeld, including both the electrostatic part and the electric ﬁeld due to
a changing magnetic ﬁeld, is
E = −∇V −∂A
∂t .
(1.12)
1.1.4
Mutual inductance
Since electric currents produce magnetic ﬁelds, time-varying currents produce time-varying
magnetic ﬁelds. Hence, a time-varying current in a circuit will produce a time-varying mag-
netic ﬂux through a nearby circuit loop causing an emf in that loop. The mutual inductance
was introduced in Chapter 5 of “Essential Electromagnetism” where it was deﬁned as follows.
Suppose you have two coils of wire at rest and you run current I1 around Coil 1 the magnetic
ﬂux due to Coil 1 through Coil 2 divided by I1 is the mutual inductance M of the two coils.
For the case of time-varying currents, from Faraday’s law, the emf in Coil 2 due to a changing
current in Coil 1, and the emf in Coil 1 due to a changing current in Coil 2 are
E2 = −dΦB2
dt
= −M dI1

E1 = −dΦB1

= −M dI2

Electrodynamics and conservation laws
As an example of calculating the mutual inductance we consider a solenoid comprising N1
coils tightly wound around a cylindrical rod made of a material with magnetic permeability µ,
and a second solenoid comprising N2 coils loosely wound around the ﬁrst solenoid as shown
in Fig. 1.2(a). It is easier to calculate the ﬂux due to the tightly-wound solenoid through the
loosely-wound solenoid, than the ﬂux due to the loosely-wound solenoid through the tightly-
wound solenoid.
The magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the tightly-wound solenoid is
approximately
B1(t) = µN1
h I1(t),
(1.14)
and so the magnetic ﬂux threading the N2 coils of the loosely-wound solenoid is
ΦB2(t) = N2AµN1

A circuit such as that shown in Fig. 1.2(a) could serve as a transformer in AC circuits as the
output voltage would diﬀer from the input voltage. Generally if the two coils share the same
magnetic ﬂux per individual coil element or “turn” the ratio of the voltage across the secondary
coils (Ns turns) to that across the primary coils (Np turns) is

the secondary (s). To ensure the two coils share the same magnetic ﬂux per turn, transformers
may have a core made of a high permeability material, i.e. one having µ ≫µ0 such as soft
iron. Circuit symbols for air-core and iron-core transformers are shown in Fig. 1.2(b). The core
would often be in the shape of a torus to minimise magnetic ﬂux leakage.
1.1.5
Self inductance
A changing current not only induces an emf in a nearby circuit, it also induces an emf in the
source circuit. As an example, we consider a variable voltage source V (t) connected to a solenoid
wound around a cylindrical rod made of a material with permeability µ. as in Fig. 1.3(a).

The magnetic ﬂux through the solenoid is proportional to the current ΦB = LI where L is
the self-inductance (or simply inductance) of the loop which depends only on its geometry. In
the case of the solenoid shown, with current I(t), the magnitude of magnetic ﬁeld inside the
solenoid is approximately
B(t) = µN
h I(t),
(1.18)
and so the magnetic ﬂux threading the N coils of the solenoid is
ΦB(t) = NAµN

If the current changes, the emf around the loop is
E = −dΦB
dt
= −LdI
dt .
(1.21)
Thus, changing the current through a circuit induces a “back emf” which tends to oppose the
change in magnetic ﬂux (Lenz’ law) as shown in Fig. 1.3(a).
Circuit elements designed to
have signiﬁcant self-inductance are called inductors and would usually have a core made of a
magnetically soft material, e.g. soft iron and, as with transformers, the core would often be in
the shape of a torus to minimise magnetic ﬂux leakage. Circuit symbols are shown in Fig. 1.3(b).
1.1.6
Energy stored in magnetic fields
A certain amount of energy is needed to start a current in a circuit – work is done against the
back emf to get the current going and set up the magnetic ﬁeld. The work done to move unit
charge against the back emf in one trip around the circuit is E. The amount of charge per unit
time passing down the wire is I, so the work done per unit time is

where the product rule identity for ∇· (a × b) (Eq. E.6) is used to get Eq. 1.25 and Gauss’
theorem to get Eq. 1.26. As the volume integrals are over all space, the surface integral is for
the surface at r = ∞, and with the integrand dropping faster than dS ∼r−2 we arrive at
Eq. 1.27. This tells us that the change in the magnetic energy density due to a small change
dB(r) in the magnetic ﬁeld is
d[u(r)] = H(r) · dB(r).

Maxwell's equations
Scottish theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) uniﬁed electricity and mag-
netism into classical electrodynamics. A logical development of his equations follows. In going
from electrostatics (∇× E = 0) to electrodynamics, E is no longer conservative, and ∇× E
is given instead by Faraday’s law. In a similar way, Ampere’s law needs modifying. To show
this, consider the second-derivative ∇· (∇× a) which must be zero for any vector ﬁeld a(r).
Substitution shows that E(r) satisﬁes this condition in electrodynamics, but that B(r) does not
unless Ampere’s law is modiﬁed.
The divergence of Ampere’s law
∇· (∇× B)
=
∇· (µ0J)
(1.31)
is non-zero in electrodynamics because charge conservation requires that
∇· J
=
−∂ρ
∂t .
(1.32)
Eq. 1.32 is the continuity equation.
We can gain further insight to the problem by considering the charging a capacitor as in Fig. 1.4.
Ampere’s law in integral form
∮
Γ
B · dr = µ0
∫
S
J · dS
(1.33)
should apply for any surface S bounded by closed loop Γ, such as surfaces S1, S2 or S3. The
right hand side is µ0I for surfaces S1 and S3, but is zero for surface S2 which goes between the
capacitor plates.

where
JD ≡ε0

(1.36)
is the displacement current density, and has the same dimensions as the current density. Since
JD is caused by a changing electric ﬁeld, it will be non-zero between the capacitor plates in
Fig. 1.4.
Using Eq. 1.35, Ampere’s Law can then be modiﬁed to make ∇· (∇× B) = 0, i.e.
∇× B = µ0J + µ0ε0
∂E

(1.37)
which is Ampere’s law as modiﬁed by Maxwell. From this we may conclude that currents and
displacement currents are on an equal footing in electrodynamics, and that a changing electric
ﬁeld induces a magnetic ﬁeld.
Returning to the problem of the charging capacitor (Fig. 1.4), and assuming the electric ﬁeld
is uniform between the plates and zero elsewhere, Gauss’ law gives

Hence, the total displacement current ID between the plates is identical to the current I in the

1.2.2
Maxwell's equations in vacuum and in matter
Maxwell modiﬁed Ampere’s law in 1865 to make it apply to electrodynamics by adding the
displacement current to the current.
Replacing ε0E with D and B/µ0 with H we obtain
versions applicable to matter. The sets of four equations of electrodynamics thus modiﬁed are
known as Maxwell’s equations:
Vacuum:
Matter:

∂E

∇× H

(Ampere’s law)
(1.40)
These four equations together with the Lorentz force law F = q(E+v×B) encapsulate classical
electrodynamics.
1.3
Conservation of energy
In 1884 English physicist John Henry Poynting (1852–1914) published his theorem, which is an
expression of the law of conservation of energy in electrodynamics. We shall obtain Poynting’s
theorem from Maxwell’s equations by taking the dot product of E with Ampère’s Law and the
dot product of H with Faraday’s Law to obtain
E · (∇× H)
=
E ·
(
J + ∂D
∂t
)
,
(1.41)
H · (∇× E)
=
H ·
(
−∂B
∂t
)
.
(1.42)
Subtracting Eq. 1.42 from Eq. 1.41 gives
E · (∇× H) −H · (∇× E)
=
E · J +
(
E · ∂D
∂t + H · ∂B
∂t
)
.

Then using the product rule ∇· (e × h)
=
h · (∇× e) −e · (∇× h) we obtain
−∇· (E × H)
=
E · J +
(
E · ∂D
∂t + H · ∂B
∂t
)
.
(1.44)
Taking the volume integral of both sides, and then using Gauss’ theorem on the left hand side
we get Poynting’s Theorem:
−

(E × H) · dΣ =
∫

E · J d3r +

V

(1.45)
where dΣ is the surface element, and surface Σ bounds volume V .
Take a look at the two terms on the right hand side of Eq. 1.45:
∫
V
E · J d3r — this is the power dissipated in volume V as kinetic energy (e.g. Joule heating);
∫
V
(
E · ∂D
∂t + H · ∂B
∂t
)
d3r — this is the rate of increase of ﬁeld energy in volume V .
Hence

(E × H) · (−dΣ) must be the rate of ﬂow of energy through area Σ into volume V

which gives the energy ﬂux (W m−2) carried by the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and points in the
direction of energy ﬂow.

Conservation of momentum
One can derive the equation describing conservation of momentum from the force on a particle
of charge q, as given by Lorentz force equation F = (qE + qv × B). For the charges inside
volume V this becomes
dPpart
dt
=
∫
V
(ρE + J × B)d3r
(1.47)
where Ppart is the total momentum of the particles inside V , and we have used ρv = J. Using
all four of Maxwell’s equations, the integrand can be written

(Gauss’ law and the modiﬁed Ampere’s law were used in Eq. 1.48, and Faraday’s law was used
in Eq. 1.50, and ∇· B = 0 in Eq. 1.51).

we can identify the left hand side as the rate of change of particle and ﬁeld momentum in
volume V , and so the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum density must be
g = ε0E × B = µ0ε0E × H =

c2 S.
(1.53)
The right had side of Eq. 1.52 must equal the rate of ﬂow of momentum into volume V . We
will see this more easily if we are able to re-write the right hand side as a ﬂux integral with the
help of Gauss’ theorem, but we must ﬁrst write the integrand as the divergence of some ﬁeld.
But, since the rate of increase of momentum density is a vector ﬁeld having 3 dimensions, the
quantity we must take the divergence of will have 9 dimensions. This tensor ﬁeld, Tij, is called
the Maxwell stress tensor, and momentum conservation in electrodynamics is expressed by

2.1
The wave equation and its monochromatic plane wave solutions
I will start with a discussion of the one-dimensional (1D) wave equation and its general solu-
tion before moving on to sinusoidal waves. Next, the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, wave
number, phase velocity and angular frequency will be deﬁned, and the relationships between
them given. The concept of a complex wave function with its real part representing a physical
quantity will then be introduced, the 1D wave equation will be generalised to three-dimensions
(3D), and the monochromatic plane wave solutions to the 3D wave equation will be given in
complex form.

(2.1)
(b)
f(x, t) = f(x + vt, 0) = ψ−(x + vt),

where ψ+ and ψ−could be any diﬀerentiable functions. A linear superposition of these two

It is usual to write a sinusoidal wave in terms of its wave number k = 2π/λ and angular frequency
ω = vk = 2πν,
f(x, t) = f0 cos(kx −ωt + δ).
(2.5)
In this case, if k is positive the wave travels in the +x direction, and if k is negative the wave
travels in the −x direction. Usually engineers prefer to write f(x, t) = f0 cos(ωt −kx + δ) for a
wave travelling in the +x direction.
In classical physics it is often convenient for the wave function to be complex, and to write it in
terms of complex exponentials. Then its real part represents the physical quantity. (Caution:
this is diﬀerent to the wave function Ψ(x, t) encountered in quantum mechanics whose modulus
squared represents probability density.) Then the physical quantity is
f(x, t) = |f0| Re
{
ei(kx−ωt+δ)}
= Re
{
f0 ei(kx−ωt)}
= |f0| cos(kx −ωt + δ)
(2.6)
where i ≡√−1 and f0 = |f0|eiδ is the complex amplitude. From now on, whenever we see a
complex quantity the physical quantity is to be understood to be its real part.

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
The wave functions represented by Eqs. 2.5 and 2.6 are
monochromatic (from the ancient
Greek for single-colour - in general single-frequency) solutions of the wave equation, unlike the
impulse of Fig. 2.1 which Fourier analysis would show to contain a broad range of frequencies.
Note that engineers usually prefer to use j as the symbol representing √−1, and would write
f(x, t) = Re
{
f0 ej(ωt−kx)}
for a wave travelling in the +x direction.
In reality waves travel in three-dimensions, and generalising the one-dimensional wave equation
(Eq. 2.3) to three dimensions gives the three-dimensional wave equation

to these planes of constant phase, i.e. parallel to k, are called rays (see Fig. 2.3a); a concept
useful in ray optics.

The speed v actually gives the speed at which the phase propagates, the phase velocity,
vp = ω
k .
(2.10)
If there is dispersion, i.e. diﬀerent frequencies propagate at diﬀerent velocities, then k = k(ω)
and in Chapter 3 we will need to distinguish the phase velocity from the velocity at which
wave-packets propagate, the group velocity vg. For this reason, from now on I will use vp rather
than v to represent the wave velocity in non-dispersive media. As we shall shortly see, vp = c
for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum.
Another important class of solutions of the 3D wave equation are the spherical waves
(see
Fig. 2.3b)
f(r, t) = f0 r−1 exp[i(kr −ωt)]
(spherical wave travelling outwards from origin) (2.11)
f(r, t) = f0 r−1 exp[i(−kr −ωt)]
(spherical wave travelling in towards origin).

The wave intensity is the energy transported per unit time through unit area perpendicular to
the wave direction. This is proportional to square of wave function, and for spherical waves
is proportional to r−2. In the case of outgoing spherical waves this is the well known “inverse
square law” which applies equally to the sound or light intensity from point sources. Examples
of spherical waves travelling inwards include a convex lens or concave mirror focusing light
waves to a point, and radio waves from a distant source being focused by a radio telescope dish
onto a small antenna at its focus.
2.2
Transmission lines
Transmission lines are electrical cables which consist of two parallel conductors of uniform cross
section, usually separated by a dielectric, and which are designed to transmit radio frequency
(∼kHz to ∼300 MHz) signals from one place to another. Examples include twin lead (two
parallel wires), coaxial cable and the strip line. At lower frequencies (50 Hz or 60 Hz) overhead
power lines are used to transmit electricity from a remote generating station to a city.
At
microwave frequencies (∼300 MHz to ∼300 GHz) waveguides are used, for infrared frequencies
specialised waveguides are made of layers of diﬀerent dielectrics, and at optical frequencies we
see the application of optical ﬁbres. In this section we shall only discuss transmission lines
which comprise two parallel conductors.
We will consider a section of a transmission line as if it were an electrical circuit, and so we need
to brieﬂy review the circuit rules due to German physicist Gustav Kirchhoﬀ(1824–1887). His
ﬁrst rule, the junction rule, expresses conservation of charge – it requires that the rate at which
charge ﬂows into a junction must equal the rate at which charge ﬂows out of that junction.
This is conveniently expressed in terms of currents as: “at any point, the sum of all currents
entering a junction must equal the sum of all currents leaving that junction”. For the junction
shown in Fig. 2.4(a) this implies I2 + I3 + I4 = I1.

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
Kirchhoﬀ’s 2st rule, the loop rule, expresses energy conservation, and requires for DC circuits
that the sum of the changes in potential around any closed path of a circuit must be zero. For
the circuit shown in Fig. 2.4(b) which, from Ohm’s law, has current I = V /(R1 + R2) ﬂowing
around it this implies
Vba + Vcb + Vac

0.
∴

(2.13)
In AC circuits which include inductors, the electric ﬁeld is not conservative and so the potential
is undeﬁned. However, we can still use Kirchhoﬀ’s 2nd rule if for the change across an inductor
we use the emf. Hence, for the AC circuit in Fig. 2.4(c) we have
E(t) −I(t)R −LdI

Lossless transmission line equations
We will only discuss lossless transmission lines, i.e. where there is no resistance present between
or along the conductors. Then the equivalent circuit of inﬁnitesimal length dx is shown in

For harmonic time-dependence with angular frequency ω we can use complex exponentials
V (x, t) = Vfei(kx−ωt) + Vbei(−kx−ωt),
I(x, t) = Ifei(kx−ωt) + Ibei(−kx−ωt),
(2.24)
where k = ω/vp, and Vf and Vb are the complex voltage amplitudes of waves propagating in
the forward and backwards directions, i.e. in the positive and negative x-directions (we take
the real parts for the actual voltage and current). Similarly, If and Ib are the complex current
amplitudes of waves propagating in the positive and negative x-directions.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

2.2.2
Standing waves on a lossless transmission line
Unless the line is terminated with the characteristic impedance there will also be reﬂected waves
traveling in the −x direction, and the wave amplitude will be the sum of incident and reﬂected
components. If the line is open-circuit, i.e. nothing connected to output terminals, the resistance
is inﬁnite. In this case the reﬂected wave will be inverted and the result will be a standing wave.
To see this let’s apply the boundary condition on the current, namely at the open circuited end
the current must be zero as the charge cannot move in or out of the open-circuit end of the
transmission line. If we set the open-circuit end of the transmission line to be at x = 0, then
we must have
I(0, t) = Ife−iωt + Ibe−iωt = 0.

EM waves in vacuum and linear media
Starting with Maxwell’s equations, we shall shortly derive the wave equations for the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds and show that they predict the existence of electromagnetic (EM) waves in free
space travelling at speed c. The relationships between the ﬁelds, the wave vector and angular
frequency for a valid monochromatic EM plane wave will be determined, and the energy density,
Poynting vector and wave intensity will be derived. Since monochromatic EM plane waves are
an idealisation, we discuss when this may be a good approximation for quasi-monochromatic
EM waves through introducing the concepts of coherence.
As I shall shortly show, Maxwell’s (1865) theory predicted the existence of electromagnetic

waves travelling at the speed of light. Experiments by Hertz in 1886, in which he produced and
detected radio waves, provided proof of Maxwell’s theory. At the time it was thought that a
medium was required for propagation of EM waves. This “luminiferous aether” was supposed
to be at rest while the Earth moved through it – spinning around its axis once a day while
orbiting the Sun once per year, as the Sun orbits around the centre of the Galaxy, etc.
If the aether were ﬁxed, while the Earth moved through it, then the light transit time over a
ﬁxed baseline on Earth would depend on the orientation of the baseline with respect to the
“aether wind”. In 1887 Michelson and Morley, and later experimenters, found that there was
actually no diﬀerence with orientation, proving that there is no aether and that EM waves can
propagate without a medium. This is unique, as all other classical waves require a medium to
propagate in (e.g. sound waves in air).
To show that EM waves in a vacuum are indeed allowed, we need to derive their wave equation.
We will actually derive the wave equation for a charge-free and current-free linear medium. The
results we obtain for this case can easily be specialised to the vacuum case by setting µ →µ0
and ε →ε0.

First, take the curl of Faraday’s law, giving
∇× (∇× E) = ∇×
(
−∂B
∂t
)
= −∂
∂t (∇× B) .
(2.35)
Next, using the 2nd derivative rule ∇× (∇× a) = ∇(∇· a) −∇2a we get
∇(∇· E) −∇2E = −∂
∂t(∇× B).
(2.36)
In a charge-free region ∇· E = ρ/ε0 = 0, and we can use use Ampère’s law to replace ∇× B:

.
(2.37)
Hence, for a charge-free (ρ = 0) and current-free region (J = 0)
∇2E −µε∂2E
∂t2 =0
(Wave Eqn. for E).
(2.38)
We can derive the wave equation for B in a similar way by taking the curl of Ampère’s law,
using the same 2nd derivative rule, and ﬁnally using Faraday’s law to obtain
∇2B −µε∂2B
∂t2 = 0
(Wave Eqn. for B).
(2.39)
Equations 2.38 and 2.39 are identical in form to three-dimensional wave equation (Eq. 2.7), and
this shows that Maxwell’s equations predict that EM waves are able to propagate through a
linear material with phase velocity
vp =

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
The monochromatic plane wave solutions of Eqs. 2.38 and 2.39 are
E(r, t) = E0 exp[i(k · r −ωt)]
and
B(r, t) = B0 exp[i(k · r −ωt)].
(2.42)
Although these are solutions of the wave equation, they are not valid EM waves unless they
also satisfy Maxwell’s equations. What constitutes a valid EM wave is discussed next.
2.3.1
Relationships between k, E, B and H
The monochromatic plane wave solutions must have E0, B0, ω and k such that E and B are
consistent with Maxwell’s equations. To ﬁnd the relationships between k, E and B we shall
need the time derivative, divergence and curl of E = E0ei(k·r−ωt) and B = B0ei(k·r−ωt), as given
below, which are derived in Appendix C,
∂
∂tE = −iωE,
∇· E = ik · E,
∇× E = ik × E,
(2.43)
∂
∂tB = −iωB,
∇· B = ik · B,
∇× B = ik × B.
(2.44)
Putting E = E0ei(k·r−ωt) and B = B0ei(k·r−ωt) into Maxwell’s equations (with ρ = 0 and J = 0)
we obtain
∇· E = 0
−→
k · E = 0,
(2.45)
∇· B = 0

k · B = 0,

−→
k × E = ωB,
(2.47)
∇× B = µε∂E
∂t
−→
k × B = −µεωE.
(2.48)
We see immediately that k, E and B are orthogonal vectors as k · E = 0, k · B = 0 and
E · B = E · (k × E)/ω = 0. Hence, the EM ﬁeld of a valid monochromatic EM plane wave is
described by
E(r, t) = E0 exp[i(k · r −ωt)],

Since for an EM wave B = √µε E, the electric and magnetic contributions to energy density
are equal,

Since the momentum density is g = S/c2 (as discussed in Chapter 1), the momentum ﬂux of an
EM wave is vpg. Its magnitude is just the amount of momentum crossing unit area of a surface
perpendicular to k per unit time, and we may use it to ﬁnd the radiation pressure. If a parallel

Coherence of EM waves
The monochromatic plane wave solutions are an idealisation because they are of inﬁnite extent
in all directions and are pure sinusoidal waves, i.e. the spread in angular frequencies is ∆ω = 0.
The same is true of monochromatic spherical waves. Such waves are completely coherent. Two
identical copies of such waves, say each with amplitude E0 and peak intensity I0 = (ε0/2)E2
0c,
can be made to interfere in a predictable way and show interference fringes alternating between
100% constructive interference with Imax = (ε0/2)(E0 + E0)2c = 4I0 and 100% destructive
interference with Imin = (ε0/2)(E0 −E0)2c = 0, such that the visibility of the fringes is
V
≡
Imax −Imin
Imax + Imin
=
1.
(2.61)
Real EM waves are only partially coherent, but they may display coherence at a particular
location over a limited time called the coherence time tc, due to a partially coherent wave train
of length equal to the coherence length lc = vptc passing through that location. The width

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
of the wave front across which coherence is maintained is called the coherence width dc. The
criterion for determining these paramaters is the time, or distance, over which the phase diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from that of a pure sinusoidal wave. The coherence time, length or width may be
used to determine the conditions under which a monochromatic EM plane wave may be a good
approximation to the EM ﬁeld present.
Spectral line emission can be considered quasi-monochromatic, but even then there will be a
narrow range of frequencies about the nominal transition frequency. Thus any source of EM
waves will in practice produce waves of ﬁnite extent and have a spread of frequencies. For
example, for an atomic transition the natural line width is ∆ω ∼Γ where Γ is the spontaneous
transition rate (Einstein A coeﬃcient for spontaneous emission).
Fourier theory shows that ∆x∆kx ∼1. Given that vp = ω/k, and that for a wave travelling in
the x direction kx = k, it follows that ∆kx = ∆ω/vp such that the wave trains associated with
emitted photons will have a coherence length
lc = ∆x ∼vp

Figure 2.10: (a) A ﬁnite EM wave train due to an atomic transition. (b) A phase shift resulting
from a collision during the transition. The coherence length lc is the smallest coherent part of
the wave train.
In practice, the coherence time will be shorter and the observed width of a spectral line broader.
If, for example, during the transition the atom collides with another atom then a phase shift
is introduced, and the coherence length will be reduced accordingly (Fig. 2.10b). This eﬀect
becomes more important with increasing density and temperature and is referred to as pressure
broadening. Also, because of thermal motion, the frequency of a photon emitted by an individual
atom will be doppler shifted by an amount depending on the atom’s component of velocity
toward the observer. This Doppler broadening produces a gaussian line shape with line-width
proportional to
√
T.
To determine the coherence width consider a source of diameter D, represented as an aperture
illuminated by a quasi-monochromatic plane wave in Fig. 2.11 and a screen a distance L away.
Consider the EM ﬁeld at point O on the screen. It has contributions from the entire source
(all points between A and B). These contributions will have a deﬁnite phase at O provided the
diﬀerence between paths AO and CO is much less than half a wavelength, and this is equivalent
to the condition kD2 ≪L.

There exist both artiﬁcial and natural sources of coherent EM waves. One example of a natural
source of coherent radiation is an astrophysical maser where a molecular line in the microwave
region of the spectrum is observed. Maser stands for microwave ampliﬁcation by stimulated
emission of radiation. Astrophysical masers occur in shocked regions in molecular clouds in the
Galaxy. An upper long-lived level of a molecular species is “pumped” by collisional excitation
or infrared photons giving rise to a population inversion (more molecules in the upper level
than in the lower level they decay to). This population inversion causes stimulated emission to
dominate over absorption, resulting in a negative absorption coeﬃcient.
A single photon from spontaneous decay can initiate maser action. As it propagates through
the region of the molecular cloud having the population inversion the photon triggers repeated
stimulated emission of essentially identical photons in phase with itself, as do the photons
produced by stimulated emission. There is thus a cascade or avalanche in which the number of
photons build up exponentially with distance, and because the path-lengths through the cloud
are huge the resulting brightness (intensity per unit solid angle) of coherent microwave radiation
is suﬃciently high to be observable with radio telescopes.
Artiﬁcial sources of coherent EM radiation include both masers and lasers. In the laboratory,
artiﬁcial masers using hyperﬁne splitting of the 21cm line spin-ﬂip transition of the ground state
of neutral atomic hydrogen in a weak magnetic ﬁeld (Zeeman eﬀect discussed in Chapter 6 of
“Essential Electromagnetism”) are used as a frequency standard.
The laser (light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation) has many practical appli-
cations and works on the same principle as the astrophysical maser just discussed. The main
diﬀerences are that transitions typically in the optical or infrared are used, and various methods
(depending on the medium) are used to pump the upper (metastable) level. Also, in the laser,
the enormous path lengths needed are achieved by having a laser cavity containing the laser
medium between two parallel mirrors in which the light is reﬂected back and forth, with some
small fraction escaping from one of the mirrors (which is partially transmitting) to form a laser
beam.

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
The subject of coherence (and the closely-related ﬁeld of quantum optics) is important in
physical optics and is a ﬁeld in its own right of which we have just skimmed the surface, but
suﬃce it to say here that the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the centre of a laser beam is an excellent
approximation to that of a monochromatic EM plane wave, and that many of the results I
shall derive in the remainder of this chapter for monochromatic plane waves will apply also to
partially coherent quasi-monochromatic beams.

Polarisation of EM waves
In this section linear, circular and elliptical polarisations will be described in terms of the electric
ﬁeld of a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the +z direction which can be written
E(r, t) = (E0,xeiδxx + E0,yeiδyy)ei(kz−ωt).

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
Re{E(r, t)} = xE0,x cos(kz −ωt + δx) + yE0,y cos(kz −ωt + δy).
(2.65)
Depending on the ratio of E0,y to E0,x and the relative phase (δy −δx) the monochromatic plane
wave will be linearly, circularly or elliptically polarised.
2.5.1
Linear polarisation
In linear polarisation the two phase constants are equal, δy = δx ≡δ, and so
Re{E(r, t)} = (xE0,x + yE0,y) cos(kz −ωt + δ).
(2.66)
The locus of the tip of the E vector performs simple harmonic motion along a line at angle
θ = arctan(E0,y/E0,x) to the Ex-axis in the Ex–Ey plane as shown in Fig. 2.12. This means
that the EM wave is linearly polarised (plane polarised) such that the electric ﬁeld direction
is at angle θ to the x-axis. Fig. 2.8 already showed E and B for a linearly polarised wave.
Linearly polarised quasi-monochromatic plane waves may be produced by passing unpolarised
light through a monochromatic ﬁlter and then through a polariser such as Polaroid ﬁlm, or
better still by passing a laser beam through a polariser.

2.5.2
Circular and elliptical polarisation
In both circular and elliptical polarisation the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors rotate with
angular frequency ω. In circular polarisation E0,y = E0,x ≡E0 and (δy −δx) = ±π/2, so
that the locus of the tip of the E vector undergoes circular motion with “radius” E0 in the
Ex–Ey plane and angular frequency ω, as shown in the Fig. 2.13(a). This means that the EM
wave is circularly polarised. There are two possibilities depending on the sign of (δy −δx),
usually referred to in optics textbooks as right or left polarisation, or to use particle physics
nomenclature negative or positive helicity, respectively. Note that we are free to deﬁne δx = 0.
When discussing Faraday rotation in Chapter 3 it will be useful to use new complex basis
vectors for circularly polarised waves propagating in the +z direction,
eR = (x −i y),
eL = (x + i y).
(2.67)
Note that these basis vectors are not actually unit vectors as their magnitudes are both
√
2
rather than 1 (I have deliberately omitted the hat symbol), but we shall ﬁnd them useful in
their unnormalised form in Chapter 3. Then for right circular polarisation,
E(r, t)
=
E0 eR ei(kz−ωt)
=
E0
(
x + e−iπ/2y
)
ei(kz−ωt).
(2.68)
∴
Re{E(r, t)}
=
E0[x cos(kz −ωt + δx) + y sin(kz −ωt + δx)],
(2.69)
and for left circular polarisation,
E(r, t)
=
E0 eL ei(kz−ωt)
=
E0
(
x + e+iπ/2y
)
ei(kz−ωt).
(2.70)
∴
Re{E(r, t)}
=
E0[x cos(kz −ωt + δx) −y sin(kz −ωt + δx)].
(2.71)
In Fig. 2.13(a) we are located at some ﬁxed z, and view the wave coming towards us. If you bend
your ﬁngers and point your thumbs in the direction of the source of the wave (i.e. thumbs point
in the −z direction), and if the ﬁngers of your right hand curl in the direction of rotation of the
E vector then the polarisation is “right-handed”. Fig. 2.14 shows a wave which is right-circularly
polarised. Note that this is the usual convention used in optics.

In elliptical polarisation the tip of the E vector rotates with angular velocity ω tracing an ellipse
in the Ex–Ey plane. In the most general case the major axis of the ellipse is at some arbitrary
angle with respect to the x or y direction. However without loss of generality we could carry
out a rotation of coordinates such that the major axis is parallel to either the x or the y axis
such that (δy −δx) = ±π/2 as in circular polarisation. Then

2.6.1
Laws of reflection and refraction
Consider a monochromatic plane EM wave incident on a plane boundary between two dielectric
materials. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reﬂected. From symmetry arguments,
the reﬂected and transmitted rays must be in the same plane as the incident ray and the normal
to the boundary. This plane is called the plane of incidence. Fig. 2.15 shows the ray geometry
in the plane of incidence.

We use subscripts i, r and t to refer to quantities related to the incident, reﬂected and transmit-
ted waves, respectively. We also use subscript i to indicate the material in which the incident
wave (and reﬂected wave) propagates, and subscript t to indicate the material in which the
transmitted wave propagates.
The electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves are
Ei = Ei,0 exp{i(ki · r −ωit)}
(incident wave),
(2.76)
Er = Er,0 exp{i(kr · r −ωrt)}

hold at all times, ω must be the same for all three waves.
For the boundary conditions to be satisﬁed at every point, e.g. simultaneously at points “(i)”
and “(ii)” in Fig. 2.15,
ki · ∆r
=
kr · ∆r
=
kt · ∆r.
(2.80)
∴
ki sin θi
=
kr sin θr
=
kt sin θt.
(2.81)
Since ki = kr because the incident and reﬂected waves propagate in the same medium, we have
θi = θr
(law of reﬂection).
(2.82)
Similarly, since k = ω/vp = ωn/c and ω is the same for all waves,
ni sin θi = nt sin θt
(law of refraction or “Snell’s Law”).

Electromagnetic waves in empty space and linear dielectrics
We now know what the directions of the reﬂected and transmitted waves are, but how much
of the incident intensity is reﬂected or transmitted? The reﬂectance, R, also known as the
reﬂectivity, is the fraction of the incident power that is reﬂected. The transmittance, T, also
known as the transmissivity, is the fraction of the incident power that is transmitted.
We
shall see that the reﬂectance and transmittance are diﬀerent if the orientation of the plane of
polarisation with respect to the plane of incidence, is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of
incidence.
In general, the incident wave can be treated as a superposition of two linearly polarised waves
whose planes of polarisation are orthogonal, with one wave polarised parallel to, and the other
perpendicular to, the plane of incidence. This is equivalent in quantum mechanics to the wave
function being a superposition of eigenstates of the system. The polarisation terminology to be
used is discussed in the next section.
2.6.2
Polarisation terminology for reflection and refraction
Polarisation perpendicular to the plane of incidence is written as “σ”, “s” or “TE mode”, and
in equations as “⊥”. Polarisation parallel to the plane of incidence is written as “π” , “p” or
“TM mode”, and in equations as “∥”. This confusing nomenclature comes from the German
and Greek, s for senkrecht (perpendicular) and p for parallel (parallel), and their Greek letter
equivalents. TE mode refers to transverse electric, i.e. in this case E is perpendicular to the
plane of incidence, and TM mode (transverse magnetic mode) is when B is perpendicular to the
plane of incidence. I shall not use this nomenclature here because the incident, reﬂected and
transmitted waves of both polarisations are actually all TEM waves, i.e. transverse electromag-
netic waves with both E and B perpendicular (transverse to) to k. I shall instead reserve this
nomenclature for when I discuss waveguides where there are wave ﬁeld components parallel to
k, with TE waves having no component of E parallel to k, and TM waves having no component
of B parallel to k.
2.7
Fresnel equations
In the following sections we shall obtain the Fresnel equations for the amplitude reﬂection
coeﬃcients, and the reﬂectance and transmittance vesus the angle of incidence θ for the two
polarisations.

2.7.1
Boundary conditions at interface
As an electromagnetic wave intersects the interface between two dielectrics, it is the boundary
conditions on the electromagnetic ﬁeld that determine the properties of the reﬂected and trans-
mitted waves. In the dielectric where the incident wave is present, the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are the vector sums of those of the incident and reﬂected waves. The boundary conditions
that need satisfying can be derived from Maxwell’s equations in integral form and are the same
as were derived in “Essential Electromagnetism”. The relevant geometry is shown in Fig. 2.16
together with the Gaussian pillbox and Amperian loops to be used.

Thus, for
a monochromatic plane EM wave in a non-magnetic material, for which µ ≈µ0 such that
ε ≈n2ε0, we have a set of six simultaneous equations for Er and Et to be solved in terms of
the (known) amplitude the electric ﬁeld of the incident wave, Ei, its angle of incidence θi and
the refractive indices of the two dielectrics. For the cases of polarisation perpendicular to, or
parallel to, the plane of incidence, three of the six equations are identity equations leaving three
equations (one of these three being redundant) which we will solve in the following sections.

In this case,

2.7.4
Amplitude coefficients and phase shift for external reflection
By deﬁnition, for external reﬂection nt > ni. Hence,
√
(nt/ni)2 −sin2 θi in Eqs. 2.96, 2.97,
2.103 and 2.104 is real for all θi, and so therefore are r⊥, t⊥, r∥and t∥plotted in Fig. 2.19(a)
for light incident from air (ni ≈1) on to ﬂint glass (ni ≈1.62).
Notice that for the example in Fig. 2.19(a) as the angle of incidence varies from θi = 0◦to
90◦that the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient for parallel polarisation changes smoothly from
r∥= +0.24 to −1. The angle of incidence at which the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient for
parallel polarisation is zero is called Brewster’s angle θB, i.e. r∥(θB) = 0. At Brewster’s angle
only perpendicular polarised waves are reﬂected, and this is one method of producing linearly
polarised light. We may obtain Brewster’s angle by setting r∥= 0 in Eq. 2.103 to obtain
cos θB =
1
√
1 + (nt/ni)2 ,
(2.105)
tan θB = nt
ni
.
(2.106)
The amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcients are in general complex, but in the case of external reﬂection,
r∥and r⊥are real for all θi. If r ≥0 the phase shift is zero, but if r < 0 there is a phase shift
on reﬂection by π radians (180◦) since e±iπ = −1. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19(b).

2.7.5
Amplitude coefficients and phase shift for internal reflection
The amplitude coeﬃcients for the case of internal reﬂection r⊥, t⊥, r∥and t∥are plotted in
Fig. 2.20(a) for ﬂint glass to air. There is a critical angle of incidence θc such that if θi > θc
Snell’s law cannot be satisﬁed as sin θt would need to exceed 1. For θi > θc there will be no
transmission, t = 0, but there will be total internal reﬂection, |r| = 1. From Snell’s law with
θt = 90◦the critical angle is
θc = sin−1
(nt
ni
)
.
(2.107)
For internal reﬂection nt < ni, and so
√
(nt/ni)2 −sin2 θi in Eqs. 2.96–2.104 is either real if
θi < θc or imaginary if θi > θc. Hence, for θi < θc the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcients are real,
and so the phase shift is ϕ = 0◦if r > 0 and ϕ = 180◦if r < 0, as was the case for external
reﬂection. However, for θi > θc the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcients are complex, and what is
plotted in Fig. 2.20(b) for θi > θc is actually |r⊥| and |r∥|.
Adopting the convention used in optics texts for the sign of ϕ (e.g. Pedrotti & Pedrotti, 2nd
Ed., p. 414) the amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient is deﬁned r = |r|e−iϕ. The phase shift ϕ may

then be derived by noting that for θi > θc Eqs. 2.96 and 2.103 may be written in the form
r = a −ib
a + ib =
√
a2 + b2 e−iψ
√
a2 + b2 e+iψ = e−2iψ = e−iϕ
(2.108)
and so the phase shift is
ϕ = 2 tan−1
( b
a
)
(2.109)
where b =
√
sin2 θi −(nt/ni)2, and for perpendicular polarisation a = cos θi and for parallel
polarisation a = (nt/ni)2 cos θi. The resulting phase shifts are plotted in Fig. 2.20(b).

internal reﬂection within ﬂint glass. (For θi > θc in part (a) |r⊥| and |r∥| is plotted.)
2.7.6
Normal incidence
For normal incidence the plane of incidence is undeﬁned and the results we have obtained for the
cases of parallel and perpendicular polarisations must therefore become identical as θi →0. For
perpendicular polarisation the amplitude coeﬃcients (Eqs. 2.96 and 2.97) for normal incidence
are
r⊥(0◦) = 1 −nt/ni
1 + nt/ni
,
t⊥(0◦) =
2
1 + nt/ni
.
(2.110)
whereas for parallel polarisation Eqs. 2.103 and 2.104 become
r∥(0◦) = nt/ni −1
nt/ni + 1,
t∥(0◦) =
2
nt/ni + 1.
(2.111)
From Eqs. 2.110 and 2.111 (and θi = 0◦in Figs. 2.19 and 2.20) we see that r∥(0◦) = −r⊥(0◦),
but for normal incidence perpendicular and parallel polarisations should be identical!
So what is going on? To understand, we must remember that these coeﬃcients and phase shifts
are deﬁned relative to the electric ﬁeld directions of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted

applied to the electric ﬁelds of the reﬂected and transmitted waves in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18 for a
small angle of incidence the ﬁelds are as in Fig. 2.21.

Figure 2.21: Electric ﬁeld directions for near-normal incidence for (a) external reﬂection oﬀ
ﬂint glass and (b) internal reﬂection within ﬂint glass.
For external reﬂection (Fig. 2.21a) at normal incidence the electric ﬁeld direction of the reﬂected
wave is opposite to that of the incident wave, whereas for internal reﬂection (Fig. 2.21b) the
electric ﬁeld direction is in the same direction as that of the incident wave. Hence, for reﬂection
at normal incidence there is a phase shift of 180◦on reﬂection for external reﬂection, but no
phase shift for internal reﬂection irrespective of polarisation.
2.7.7
Reflectance and transmittance
The reﬂectance and transmittance are deﬁned in terms of the rate of energy ﬂow incident on
unit area of the interface, Si · (−e1) = Si cos θi. Thus the reﬂectance and transmittance are
R = Sr cos θr
Si cos θi

T = St cos θt

is the magnitude of the Poynting vector, and the cos θ factors take account of the projected
area of the interface as seen by the incoming and outgoing waves. Hence
R = |r|2;
T = nt

cos θt
cos θi
t2 = 1 −R.
(2.114)
For the case of internal reﬂection (Fig. 2.20) we see that as θi →θc both amplitude reﬂection
coeﬃcients obey r →1, while the amplitude transmission coeﬃcients remain ﬁnite. However,
because cos θt →0 as θi →θc while cos θi →cos θc which is ﬁnite, from Eq.2.114 we must
have T →0 as θi →θc. It is straightforward to show that R + T = 1, as required by energy
conservation. The reﬂectance is shown in Fig. 2.22 for the cases of (a) external reﬂection and
(b) internal reﬂection.
Notice that for the case of external reﬂection shown in Fig. 2.22(a) and grazing incidence, i.e..
θi →90◦, the reﬂectance approaches 100% (R →1). This phenomenon is used in the design
of imaging X-ray space telescopes, and a typical design based on XMM-Newton is sketched in

Evanescent waves and frustrated total internal reflection

the the other side of the interface to satisfy the boundary conditions. This transmitted EM
wave will have wave vector

and we see that we have a wave propagating in the e3 direction (i.e. parallel to the surface) and
so is a surface wave. However, the wave is decaying exponentially in the e1 direction, i.e. with
distance away from the surface of the dielectric. Such a surface wave is called an evanescent
wave. Examining Eq. 2.120 we see that the decay distance for the electric ﬁeld is ∼c/ω, or of
the order of magnitude of the wavelength, and that the wave cannot propagate into the region
away from the dielectric as a monochromatic plane wave.
Evanescent waves may cross a small gap (as in quantum tunnelling) if a slab of similar dielectric

is brought within a few wavelengths of the dielectric in which the wave is incident. In that case
part of the incident wave tunnels through the gap and propagates in the slab as a monochromatic
plane wave in the same direction as the original incident wave, but with reduced intensity
depending on the width of the gap. This “frustrated total internal reﬂection” has practical
applications in optics with beam-splitters and optical ﬁbre junctions.

3.1
Dispersion and absorption
In general, the refractive index n(ω) is complex, as is the wave number k(ω) = n(ω)/c. Hence,
for a monochromatic plane wave in matter
E(r, t) = E0 exp [i(k · r −ωt)]
(3.1)
= E0 exp
[
i
(
Re{k}k · r −ωt
)]
exp
(
−Im{k}k · r
)
.
(3.2)
This means that the intensity I(r) = ⟨S(r, t)⟩∝⟨[E(r, t)]2⟩decays exponentially with distance,
I(r) = E2
0 exp
[
−α(ω)k · r
]
, where α(ω) = 2 × Im{k(ω)} is the absorption coeﬃcient.
3.1.1
Lorentz oscillator model of dielectrics
The molecular polarisability of atoms can be approximated by modelling the atom semi-
classically as a nucleus of eﬀective charge +e surrounded by a spherical electron “cloud” of
radius a0 ≈10−10 m corresponding to a single valence electron (charge -e). The justiﬁcation
being that the nucleus is screened by all but one of the electrons, and therefore has eﬀective
charge +e.
When an electric ﬁeld is applied, the electron cloud becomes displaced by re with respect to the
nucleus and experiences a restoring force −κre, where κ ≈e2/4πε0a3
0 is the “spring constant”
(see Fig. 3.1, and Chapter 4 of “Essential Electromagnetism”). The net force on the valence
electron is
me
d2re
dt2 = −eE −κre,
(3.3)
and in electrostatics, we set the net force to zero to ﬁnd equilibrium displacement re = −eE/κ,
dipole moment p = e2E/κ and molecular polarisability αpol = e2/κ = 4πε0a3
0.
In electrodynamics, E = E(t) oscillates, and the electrons oscillate in response. Because of
various drag forces analogous to friction, we must add a “damping term” which is proportional
to velocity,

which corresponds to frequencies in the ultraviolet. If a monochromatic plane wave (photons)
with frequency close to ω0 were incident on the atom, the work done against the friction-type
forces to allow the atom oscillate would cause strong absorption of photons. In reality an atom
is not a classical system with only one resonance, but rather a quantum system with many
resonant frequencies. Nevertheless we can use this semi-classical model to describe the essential
dielectric properties of materials.

Figure 3.2: Refractive index and reciprocal group velocity in the Lorentz oscillator model for
two resonances: ω1 = 3, (Ne2/ε0me)f1 = 0.2, γ1 = 0.12, and ω2 = 5, (Ne2/ε0me)f2 =
2, γ2 = 0.4. The yellow shaded regions show the frequency ranges where there is anomalous
dispersion. The black curve shows c/vg where vg is the group velocity which I shall discuss later
in this chapter.
The Lorentzian function has full width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to γj and is normalised
to unit area, and describes the shape of absorption and emission lines, and is found in many
physical situations, both quantum and classical, involving driven resonant systems. Heavily
damped oscillators have broad line-widths — respond to a wider range of driving frequencies
around a resonant frequency ωi. The spectral line-width depends on the Q factor, which is a
measure of the sharpness of the resonance and depends on γi.
If we wish to apply this model to real materials, we need to replace the classical oscillators with
resonance frequencies ωj with quantum oscillators corresponding to quantum transitions from
level i to level k with absorption of a photon with energy close to ℏωik = (Ek −Ei), and with
oscillator strengths fik and line-widths γik determined using quantum mechanics.

Dispersion
For EM waves in a medium the phase velocity is
vp(ω) =

Re{k(ω)} =
c
Re{n(ω)}.
(3.23)
Since the refractive index depends on frequency, dispersion will occur. Dispersion causes dif-
ferent colours present in white light to be separated when passed through a glass prism, and
wave packets to travel at a velocity called the group velocity.
3.2.1
Wave packets and group velocity
A wave packet is the superposition of a group of waves travelling together and localised in
space at some initial time. For a wave packet travelling in the z direction with its electric ﬁeld
polarised in the y direction, say, and with Ey(z, 0) being the y-component of electric ﬁeld at
t = 0, there would be a distribution of wavenumbers given by the Fourier transform
Ey(k) =
∫
Ey(z, 0)e−ikzdz.

We can recover the original electric ﬁeld by taking the inverse Fourier transform
Ey(z, 0) = 1
2π
∫
Ey(k)eikzdk.
(3.25)
Ey(z, 0) and Ey(k) constitute Fourier transform pairs, Ey(z, 0) ⇐⇒Ey(k). The electric ﬁeld of
the wave packet at a later time would be
Ey(z, t) = 1

(3.26)
We shall now derive the velocity at which the wave packets travel. For a narrow distribution

The speed of light divided by the group velocity has been added to Fig. 3.2 and we see that
provided (dRe{n}/dω) > 0 there is normal dispersion, but for (dRe{n}/dω) < 0 the group
velocity can exceed c and this is termed anomalous dispersion. Anomalous dispersion is always
accompanied by absorption, and so the group velocity is then no longer a meaningful concept
– in this case it is not the speed of transportation of energy or information – and so special
relativity is not violated. The regions of anomalous dispersion are shown by the yellow shaded
regions in Fig. 3.2.

Refractive index of a conductor
For EM wave propagation in a conductor we must include the current density J = σE, where
σ is the conductivity, when deriving the wave equation from Maxwell’s equations in matter.
Taking the curl of Faraday’s law we derive the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld
∇× (∇× E) = ∇× (−∂B/∂t)
(3.40)
∇(∇· E) −∇2E = −∂
∂t(∇× B)
(3.41)
0 −∇2E = −∂
∂t
[
µσE + µε
(∂E
∂t
)]
(3.42)
∇2E −µσ∂E
∂t −µε∂2E
∂t2 = 0.
(3.43)
Similarly, from Ampere’s law we can derive the wave equation for the magnetic ﬁeld
∇2B −µσ∂B
∂t −µε∂2B
∂t2 = 0,
(3.44)
which we see has identical form. Substituting the monochromatic plane wave solution E =
E0 exp{i(k · r −ωt)} into the wave equation we obtain
[−k2 + µσiω + µεω2]E = 0,
(3.45)
and hence the dispersion relation for EM waves in a conductor
k(ω) = (µσiω + µεω2)1/2.
(3.46)
For a good conductor σ ≫εω, and so we have
k(ω) ≈i1/2(µσω)1/2
(3.47)
k(ω) ≈(1 + i)2−1/2(µσω)1/2

where we have used i1/2 = (eiπ/2)1/2 = eiπ/4 =

(σ = 4.1 Ω−1 m−1).
As we have seen, at high frequencies EM waves cannot penetrate far inside a conductor. One
example is sea water which has a skin depth of about 30 cm at 1 MHz and 10 m at 1 kHz,
depending on temperature and salinity (see upper curve in Fig. 3.5). This causes radio com-

munication problems with submarines, and so VLF (3–30 kHz) or even ELF (300 Hz–3 kHz)
frequencies are used instead.
A related phenomenon concerns the transmission of high frequency oscillating currents in con-
ductors. These currents generate oscillating magnetic ﬁelds which induce electric ﬁelds, which
in turn produce eddy currents and associated resistive power loss. These induced electric ﬁelds,
which oppose the change in the magnetic ﬁeld, are strongest in the centre of the conductor and
eﬀectively increase the resistivity there, with the upshot that the conduction current becomes
conﬁned to a thin outer layer of thickness comparable to the skin depth. Since the inside of
a conducting wire is not used, a hollow wire works just as well and is lighter. Alternatively,
plating a copper wire with a thin layer of silver (a better conductor) reduces power loss. Finally,
EM waves (and associated energy) can be transmitted inside waveguides which, at microwave
frequencies, are suitably designed hollow metal conducting pipes.
The reﬂectance of good conductors is high, and so a thin coating ∼0.1 µm of silver or aluminium
is deposited on the front surface of a concave parabolic or spherical glass surface in a reﬂecting
telescope.
The refractive index of a conductor is complex.
However, we can still use the
amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient for external reﬂection (air/metal) at normal incidence (for either
polarisation), e.g. from Eq. 2.110, to obtain the reﬂectance (Exercise 3–1)

Data on Re{n}(ω) and Im{n}(ω) are available and have been used together with Eq. 3.52 to
calculate the reﬂectance as a function of wavelength for aluminium, silver, gold and copper
shown in Fig. 3.6.
We are also able to estimate the refractive index of a good conductor from its conductivity
using the formula we derived for the wave number (Eq. 3.48), and then use Eq. 3.52 to obtain
an estimate of the reﬂectance, which has been added to Fig. 3.6 (dashed curves). As can be
seen, clearly reality is much more complicated than our simple classical theory, and requires
condensed matter theory for a proper understanding. Nevertheless, there is good agreement
above 2µm (2000 nm) in copper, and the agreement is acceptable above 10µm (10,000 nm) in
aluminium, gold and silver.

Wave propagation in dilute plasmas
In this section we consider wave propagation in an ionised plasma comprising ne electrons and
ni ions per unit volume. In a dilute plasma we can ignore the (typically distant) ions as they
provide little damping to the motion of the electrons, and because of their much higher mass
they contribute little to the current density.
We start by deriving the electrical conductivity from the motion of individual electrons which
undergo acceleration in response to the electric ﬁeld of the wave

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

No EM wave propagation can occur below the plasma frequency which is the cut-oﬀfrequency
of a dilute plasma. Above the cut-oﬀfrequency the phase velocity exceeds c but the group
velocity is less than c.

For frequencies well above the highest resonant frequency, i.e. ω ≫ωj for all j, we can neglect

Dispersion of pulses from a pulsar
Pulsars (magnetised neutron stars) emit one or more narrow radio pulses every rotation period,
rather like a lighthouse. The interstellar medium is partly ionised and the electron number
density varies throughout the Galaxy – the average value in the Galactic plane is ne ∼3×10−7
m−3 giving νp ≡ωp/2π ∼50 kHz. Pulses travel at vg(ν), so high frequencies arrive earlier than
low frequencies, with pulses at extremely high frequencies travelling at c.
Pulsars are often observed by radio telescopes at two or more frequencies, typically at 650 MHz
to 700 MHz frequencies, well above the plasma frequency. The time delay of a pulse at angular
frequency ω from a pulsar at distance L with respect to the same pulse observed at angular
frequency ω →∞is

(3.79)
The dispersion measure can be found from the pulse delays at two or more frequencies, giving
the pulsar’s distance L if ne(r) along the line of sight to the pulsar is known. If L is known,
e.g. by parallax or other methods, the observed dispersion measures of pulsars throughout the
Galaxy can be used to reﬁne models of ne(r).
Identical physics applies to radio pulses propagating through the ionosphere between, e.g. Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and the Earth. In this case the relevant quantities are the
vertical total electron content
VTEC ≡
∫∞
0
ne(h)dh,
(3.80)
where h is the altitude, and the slant total electron content STEC=VTEC× sec θ where θ is
the zenith angle of the satellite as seen by the tracking station. VTEC and STEC are usually
measured in units of 1 TECU= 1016 electrons m−2.

Faraday rotation and applications to radio astronomy
When a linearly polarised wave propagates through a magnetised plasma (or dielectric), its
plane of polarisation rotates. This eﬀect was observed by Michael Faraday for polarised light
passing through a dielectric in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. It is caused by the phase velocity
being diﬀerent for right and left circularly polarised waves. We can most easily show this for

the case of a dilute plasma in which there is a component of magnetic ﬁeld present along the
direction of wave propagation.
For convenience let’s assume that B = B∥z and that the wave propagates in the +z direction.
Then using the (unnormalised) basis vectors for circular polarisation (Eq. 2.67), at z = 0 the
electric ﬁeld of a right-circularly polarised wave is
E(x, y, 0, t) = ER eR e−iωt = ER (x −iy)e−iωt.
(3.81)
Furthermore, let’s assume that electrons located at z = 0 will undergo circular motion in the
constant magnetic ﬁeld in response to the electric ﬁeld of the wave. For convenience consider
an electron orbiting around the origin. Its position will be
r(t)

is 102.85 pc cm−3, where 1 pc = 3.09 × 1016 m (1 parsec) is the distance unit used by

10,000.0 MHz to 10,000.1 MHz. It transmits using a dipole antenna aligned perpendicular
to the plane of the ecliptic (the plane containing the Earth’s orbit). We are just renewing
radio contact as the space probe is emerging from behind the solar limb.
The Sun’s corona is an extremely hot (> 106 K) plasma which is highly variable, and
has dynamic coronal loops of magnetised plasma. The corona is located above the Sun’s
photosphere. At the time we are observing, the base of the corona in front of the space probe
as it emerges from behind the Sun has an electron number density of ne(R⊙) ∼3×1015 m−3.
The corona’s a scale height is about H ∼108 m, such that the electron number density
decreases with height as ne(r) = ne(R⊙) exp[−(r −R⊙)/H]. Imagine that, at the time we
are observing, the Sun’s magnetic dipole moment is m = 2 × 1029 A m2 and it happens to
be pointing directly towards Earth.
(a) What is the minimum radio frequency that we are able to receive from the space probe?
(b) What is the additional delay of the pulses due to propagation through the corona?
(c) By how much has the plane of polarisation of the EM wave carrying the data signal
rotated due to propagation through the corona?
[Make what you think are reasonable approximations – do not attempt a rigorous calcula-
tion. The radius of the solar photosphere is R⊙= 6.955 × 108 m.]

Learning objectives
—
To be able to show that the boundary conditions at the surface of a perfect conductor
forbid transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves propagating inside a waveguide, but allow
transverse electric (TE) waves and transverse magnetic (TM) waves.
—
To understand that the ﬁeld of a monochromatic EM wave propagating inside a rectan-
gular waveguide with k = kz can be written
E(x, y, z, t) = E0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt),
B(x, y, z, t) = B0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt).
where the ﬁeld amplitude functions E0(x, y) and B0(x, y) can be found by substitution
into Maxwell’s equations in diﬀerential form and applying the boundary conditions.
—
To know that by using Faraday’s and Ampere’s laws we get equations for the x and y
components of E0(x, y) and B0(x, y) in terms of the z components, and that by subse-
quently using ∇· E = 0 and ∇· B = 0 we obtain partial diﬀerential equations for the
z components of E0(x, y) and B0(x, y) which can be solved by separation of variables
leading to various discrete TE and TM modes.

To be able to apply the boundary conditions to obtain the dispersion relation, phase and
group velocities for each of the TMmn and TEmn modes, and show that each mode has a
cut-oﬀfrequency ωmn, the lowest being for the TE10 mode.
Waveguides are devices used to guide electromagnetic waves. At optical frequencies these would
be optical ﬁbres. At microwave frequencies these are empty hollow metal pipes and it is these
we shall consider in this section. Examples of waveguide components are shown in Fig. 4.1.
We shall approximate the metal by a perfect conductor, and inside a perfect conductor E = 0
and B = 0, so that the boundary conditions on the electromagnetic ﬁelds at the metal surface
just outside the conductor are simpliﬁed to
E∥= 0,
B⊥= 0,
(4.1)
i.e. the electric ﬁeld at the surface is normal to the surface, and the magnetic ﬁeld at the surface
is parallel to the surface.
We shall show that the boundary conditions do not allow transverse electromagnetic (TEM)
waves such as those present in empty space to propagate inside a long (length L ≫λ) narrow
(width W ≲λ) hollow metal pipe. Either E or B must have a longitudinal component for an
EM wave to propagate. We can easily prove this by contradiction, i.e. by trying to ﬁnd a TEM
solution for, say, the case of a hollow metal pipe of circular cross section. Remembering that
magnetic ﬁeld lines have no beginning or end, and that the boundary conditions require that
the magnetic ﬁeld at the surface of a (perfect) conductor to be parallel to the surface, I sketch
the simplest magnetic ﬁeld line allowed both by the boundary conditions and by the cylindrical
symmetry, and having B transverse to the axis of the pipe (Fig. 4.2a).

Waveguides
Remembering that electric ﬁeld lines start on positive charge, the pipe is empty and the only
possible location of charge is on the surface of the conductor, and that the boundary conditions
requires the electric ﬁeld at the surface of the (perfect) conductor to be normal to the surface, I
sketch the simplest electric ﬁeld lines allowed by the boundary conditions and by the cylindrical
symmetry while having E transverse to both B and the axis of the pipe (Fig. 4.2b). There is
clearly a problem because electric ﬁeld lines must end on negative charge but the pipe contains
no charge other than on the surface.
The only way to solve the problem while maintaining both E and B transverse to the pipe’s
axis is to introduce a central conducting wire (Fig. 4.2c), but then we no longer have an empty
pipe – instead we have a coaxial cable. A coaxial cable does act to guide TEM waves, and is
therefore strictly speaking a waveguide, but is not what we usually mean by a “waveguide”,
i.e. a hollow conducting pipe. Of course one can shine a narrow laser beam along the axis of a
metal pipe of large diameter, but in this case the pipe is not actually guiding the laser’s TEM
wave. What we are really talking about is the impossibility of a TEM wave with coherence
width comparable to or larger than the width of the pipe, so that the pipe could be considered
as genuinely guiding a monochromatic TEM plane wave along the pipe.
Although our proof was for a pipe of circular cross section, we shall shortly prove that TEM
waves can’t propagate down a rectangular cross-section pipe, and it can also be proved for long
hollow metal pipes of any shape. There must be a component of either the magnetic ﬁeld or
of the electric ﬁeld along the pipe. If B has a component along the waveguide then only E is
transverse, i.e. we have a transverse electric (TE) wave. Similarly, if E has a component along
the waveguide then only B is transverse, i.e. a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.
4.1
Waves in rectangular waveguides
Rectangular cross-section metal pipes are used to guide EM waves at microwave frequencies,
say to or from a transmitting or receiving antenna. We shall consider monochromatic plane
waves propagating down a such rectangular cross-section waveguides of inﬁnite length in the
z-direction (Fig. 4.3). The electromagnetic ﬁeld of a monochromatic EM wave inside the waveg-
uide is of the form
E(x, y, z, t) = E0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt),
B(x, y, z, t) = B0(x, y)ei(kz−ωt),

Thus, if we know the longitudinal ﬁelds we can obtain the transverse ﬁelds.
We have already shown that TEM waves cannot occur in a hollow circular cross-section waveg-
uide.
We are now in a position to prove that TEM waves are also impossible in a rectan-
gular cross-section waveguide. Putting both E0

z = 0 into Eqs. 4.15–4.18 gives
B0

TM waves have Bz = 0 and Ez ̸= 0. We can solve Eq. 4.21 for E0
z(x, y) by the method of
separation of variables. We seek a solution of the form
E0
z(x, y) = X(x)Y (y)
(4.23)
and substitute it into Eq. 4.22 to get

X(x) = F sin(κxx) + G cos(κxx),

Y (y) = F sin(κyy) + G cos(κyy).

This solution gives the amplitude function of Ez for the TMmn mode; the 1st index m by
convention is associated with the larger dimension and the 2nd n with the smaller dimension.
We have now obtained the solution of Eq. 4.21 for TM waves. Note that the lowest possible
TM mode is TM11.
4.2.2
TE modes
TE waves have Ez = 0 and Bz ̸= 0. We can solve Eq. 4.22 for B0
z(x, y) by the method of
separation of variables
B0
z(x, y) = X(x)Y (y)
(4.32)
as for the case of the TM modes, and with the same form for the solutions X(x) and Y (y) (as
given by Eqs. 4.29 and 4.30). We now need to ﬁnd allowed values of F, G, F, G, κx and κy for
TE modes from the boundary conditions on the magnetic ﬁeld at the surface of the conductor
B⊥= 0 (Eqs. 4.1), i.e. at x = 0, x = a, y = 0 and y = b in Fig. 4.4.
Since the waveguide is aligned along the z direction the z-component of B is always parallel to
the conducting surface and so B⊥= 0 is always satisﬁed by Bz. To get a useful constraint on
X(x) we must instead use Bx with B0
x(0, y) = B0
x(a, y) = 0 as required by B⊥= 0. Eq. 4.15
gives B0
x in terms of B0
z and E0
z, but since for TE waves Ez = 0 we obtain

Hence,

(at x = 0 and x = a),
(4.34)
and diﬀerentiating Eq. 4.29 with respect to x we obtain
κxF cos(κxx) −κxG sin(κxx) = 0
(at x = 0 and x = a)
(4.35)
which requires F = 0 and κx = mπ/a for m = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Similarly, To get a useful constraint on Y (y) we must instead use By with B0

y(b, y) =

y in terms of B0

z (0 for TE waves). The result is that

z(x, y) is constant and Eqs. 4.15–4.18 yield

Dispersion relation, phase and group velocities
We can ﬁnd the dispersion relation from Eq. 4.28
k2c2 = ω2 −κ2
xc2 −κ2

(4.37)
∴
kc =
√
ω2 −ω2mn
(4.38)
where
ωmn ≡cπ
√(m

)2
+
(n

.
(4.39)
If ω < ωmn the wave number is imaginary, and the TEmn and TMmn waves do not propagate
(they die oﬀexponentially), so ωmn is the cut-oﬀfrequency for the TEmn and TMmn modes.
Since there is no TM10, the lowest cut-oﬀfrequency occurs for the TE10 mode and is ω10 = cπ/a.
The complete EM ﬁelds for the TE and TM modes are given in Appendix 4.36.
The phase and group velocities for TE and TM modes are

and they are plotted in Fig. 4.5. Note that vg/c = c/vp (similar to a dilute plasma).
When using a waveguide to transmit a signal at a given frequency, it is important that only one
waveguide mode is excited otherwise more than one copy of the signal will propagate along the
waveguide, each with a diﬀerent velocity. From Fig. 4.5 we see that this can be accomplished if
the frequency is between ν10 and ν20. Waveguides with diﬀerent widths are therefore designed
for use at diﬀerent frequencies, e.g. a standard waveguide for the “X-band” (8.2–12.4 GHz) has
internal cross section 2.286 cm by 1.143 cm.

The EM field and power transmitted for TE10 mode
For all the TE modes the amplitude function of the longitudinal component of the magnetic
ﬁeld is given by Eq. 4.36. We can get all the other ﬁeld amplitude functions from B0
z(x, y)
and E0
z(x, y) = 0 using Eqs. 4.15—4.18, and then multiplying by exp [i (kz(ω) −ωt)] to get the
(complex) EM ﬁeld, and ﬁnally taking the real part. In this way one can ﬁnd the non-zero EM

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds for the other TE modes, and for the TM modes, can be obtained

Learning objectives
—
To understand that an accelerated charge radiates, and to be able to obtain Larmor’s
formula which gives instantaneous power P =
a2q2

—
To be able to derive the time-averaged power radiated by an oscillating dipole p(t) =
p0 cos(ωt)z, and its radiation pattern ⟨dP
dΩ⟩= p2
0 ω4 sin2 θ
32π2ε0c3
showing the characteristic
sin2 θ dependence.
—
To be able to show that a short centre-fed dipole antenna (total length d ≪λ) behaves
as an oscillating electric dipole, but know that half-wave antennas with d = λ/2 are more
eﬃcient radiators and have radiation patterns which resemble the standard dipole pattern.
—
To understand that EM waves incident on a particle (or small object) will produce os-
cillating charges or currents causing some of the incident radiation to be scattered (i.e.
absorbed and re-radiated).
—
To learn that the total cross section for scattering of EM waves is the time-averaged
power re-radiated divided by the time-averaged incident energy ﬂux, and that for free
electrons acceleration and re-radiation according to Larmor’s formula leads to Thomson
cross section for scattering of EM radiation or photons with frequencies ν ≪mec2/h by
free electrons
—
To know that for a molecule, an EM wave induces an oscillating molecular dipole αmE(t)
and a cross section which is proportional to λ−4 thereby explaining why the sky is plue
and sunsets are red.
—
To be able to derive the inhomogeneous wave equations for the potentials, their retarded
potential solutions and to derive the vector potential for sinusoidal sources.
—
To be able to apply the retarded potential solutions in the far zone to obtain the vector
potential and EM ﬁeld for a long antenna.
Whenever you accelerate a charge it radiates EM radiation. Electrons oscillating up and down
an antenna are being accelerated and radiate radio waves. In an atom in transition from one
quantum state to another there is a superposition of the two states with the electron’s probability
density oscillating and changing shape at a frequency equal to the diﬀerence in energy levels
divided by Planck’s constant, the result being the emission or absorption of a photon.

Larmor's formula
Consider a stationary isolated point charge +q at the origin.
Its electric ﬁeld lines extend
radially outward isotropically to inﬁnity as shown in Fig. 5.1(a). Suppose at time t = 0 we
accelerated that charge with acceleration a = az for an inﬁnitesimal time interval ∆t such that
it acquires velocity v = vz much less than the speed of light v ≪c.

Electric ﬁeld lines of the charge at time t after it has been accelerated during an inﬁnitesimal
time interval from t = 0 to t = ∆t, after which it reached velocity v = vz where v ≪c.
Because information cannot be transmitted faster than light, if we look at the charge at time
t, when it has moved to position r = vtz (Fig. 5.1b), we would see that at a distances r > ct
from the origin the electric ﬁeld lines would be identical to those of the charge before it had
been accelerated. However, because v ≪c, within distance r < c(t −∆t) from the origin, the
electric ﬁeld lines at time t would closely resemble those of a stationary charge +q located at
r = vtz. The ﬁeld lines inside radius c(t −∆t) must join up with those outside radius ct. This
takes place in the spherical shell between c(t −∆t) < r < ct where there will be a kink in the
ﬁeld lines which propagates outwards from the origin as a spherical wave travelling at speed c.
By taking a close-up look at one of the ﬁeld lines in the vicinity of the kink (Fig. 5.2), i.e. in
the spherical shell between c(t −∆t) < r < ct, we ﬁnd that

Notice that Eθ ∝1/r dominates over Er ∝1/r2 at large r. For c∆t ≪vt, E ≈Eθˆθ where
the ﬁeld is kinked, and so the electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of
the kink which is in the r direction. This is characteristic of electromagnetic waves which have
k · E = 0.
There will also be an azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld in the spherical shell corresponding to c(t−∆t) <

of the charge which before t = 0 had v = 0 and after t = ∆t had velocity v = a∆tz. In fact,

which is Larmor’s radiation formula, named after British physicist Sir Joseph Larmor (1857–1942)
who derived it in 1897, and is valid for v ≪c. The restriction on v is not usually a problem as
one can often Lorentz transform to a frame in which v = 0.
Interestingly, this formula was derived using essentially this method by British physicist Sir
Joseph J. Thomson (1856–1940) in (Thomson 1904, page 58) at a time when it was still thought
EM waves propagated through a luminiferous aether! Thomson was actually explaining the pro-
duction of “Röntgen rays” (what we now call X-rays) when “cathode rays” (energetic electrons)
impinge on a metal target by a process we now describe as “bremsstrahlung” (meaning braking
radiation). In that case the charges (electrons) initially had high velocities and were abruptly
decelerated producing the EM radiation (X-rays). [Thomson, JJ, 1904 Electricity and Mat-
ter, page 58, Archibald Constable & Co., Westminster. Available at California Digital Library

Electric dipole radiation
Consider a charge q undergoing simple harmonic motion in the z-direction between z = −d and
z = +d. Its electric dipole moment is
p(t) = qd cos(ωt)z = p0 cos(ωt)z.
(5.7)
The charge q experiences acceleration

To illustrate the shape of the dipole radiation pattern, sin2 θ is plotted against θ in Fig. 5.3(a).
To better visualise the radiation pattern the same curve is plotted with polar coordinates in
Fig. 5.3(b) where the vertical axis is the z-axis and corresponds to the direction of the oscillating
dipole, i.e. charge is being accelerated in the ±z direction.
Note that there is no radiation in the direction in which charge is accelerated, and the radi-
ation power per unit solid angle is maximum in all directions perpendicular to the direction
of acceleration. As there is no dependence on ϕ there is azimuthal symmetry, and the dipole
radiation pattern could be better visualised as a 3D surface traced out by rotating the curve in
Fig. 5.3(b) around the z-axis.

Short centre-fed antennas
If an AC source I(t) = I0 cos ωt is connected to a short (i.e. total length d ≪λ) centre-fed
dipole antenna (Fig. 5.4) it becomes an oscillating physical electric dipole, and so will radiate
electromagnetic waves at frequency ν = ω/2π. The current will be maximum at the centre
(z = 0) of the antenna, and zero at its ends (z = ±d/2) because it has nowhere to go. If the
antenna is short then the current will decrease linearly between the centre and the two ends,
and the charge in each arm will be uniformly distributed along its length.

Half-wave antennas
The half-wave antenna, i.e. full length d = λ/2, has the advantage of having nearly zero re-
actance, and so is an eﬃcient radiator, as well as having a radiation pattern which closely
resembles the sin2 θ dipole radiation pattern. It also has a radiation resistance of Rrad = 73 Ω
which matches well the 75 Ωimpedance of coaxial cable commonly used in radio-frequency (RF)
applications. We shall discuss long antennas in more detail at the end of this chapter.
A related type of antenna, which is eﬀectively a dipole antenna, is the ground-plane vertical
monopole antenna (Fig. 5.5a). It comprises a single vertical conductor insulated from the ground
plane. The signal is connected between the base of the vertical and the ground plane near the
base. The electric ﬁeld of a charge placed above a grounded plane is identical (above the plane)
to that of the charge plus a negative image charge at the mirror-image point below the plane. In
a similar way, the ground-plane vertical monopole antenna acts like a dipole antenna. Usually
a λ/4 ground-plane vertical antenna is used as it is equivalent to a λ/2 dipole antenna, at half
the cost! The ground-plane need not necessarily be literally the ground. In fact the earth is
far from being a perfect conductor and is often supplemented by laying a conducting surface
such as wire netting on the ground. Car antennas are often λ/4 ground-plane vertical monopole

To transmit or receive at microwave (GHz) frequencies, a λ/4 ground-plane vertical monopole
antenna is placed inside a microwave feed-horn located at the focus of a parabolic “dish”, and
pointing to “illuminate” the dish (Fig. 5.5b). Such an arrangement with an appropriate “back-
end” (receiver/transmitter and ampliﬁers) can be used to transmit and/or receive microwave
signals. It is also the basic design of a radio telescope.

Scattering of EM radiation
We can understand scattering of electromagnetic radiation in terms of acceleration of charges by
the electric ﬁeld of an EM wave, or by the electric ﬁeld of an EM wave inducing an oscillating
electric dipole in a particle, conductor or dielectric, in either case resulting in scattered (re-
radiated) EM radiation. The strength of the scattering is determined by the total scattering
cross section σ (m2).
The angular distribution of scattered photons is determined by the
diﬀerential cross section dσ/dΩ(m2 sr−1).

Formal treatment of radiation by charges and currents
So far I have discussed in a reasonable amount of detail the propagation of electromagnetic
waves, but their generation has only been dealt with in an approximate fashion when we derived
Larmor’s formula in a heuristic manner. A more rigorous approach involves deriving and solving
the wave equations for the potentials V (r, t) and A(r, t) which include the charges ρ(r, t) and
currents J(r, t) which are their sources, i.e. the inhomogeneous wave equations for the potentials.
5.4.1
Inhomogeneous wave equations for the potentials

∴

∴

(5.26)
Equations 5.23 and 5.26 can be written in a convenient form if we use the Lorentz gauge, i.e. if
we set
∇· A = −µ0ε0
∂V
∂t .
(5.27)
Then, we get the inhomogeneous wave equations

Retarded potentials
Imagine there is a variable point charge q(t) at the origin.
Strictly, this is not allowed by
conservation of charge, but if it were we would expect the potential outside the source to be a
spherical wave solution of the homogeneous wave equation for V . Since q is at the origin, the
solutions would be of the form V (r, t) = g(t+r/c)/r (incoming wave) and V (r, t) = g(t−r/c)/r
(outgoing wave), where g(x) is any diﬀerentiable function, as may be veriﬁed by substitution.
For unbounded space only the outgoing wave is the physical solution. Comparing this solution
with the potential of a point charge q at the origin, the solution of the inhomogeneous wave
equation for V must be
V (r, t) = q(t −r/c)
4πε0r
.
(5.30)
This makes sense as it takes time r/c for information about changes in the value of q at the
origin to reach radius r. We can immediately extend these ideas to obtain the solution to the
inhomogeneous wave equations (Eqs. 5.29).

For time dependent sources ρ(r, t) and J(r, t) we need to take account of the time taken for
information to propagate from the source points r′ to the ﬁeld point r, which in vacuum takes
a time |r −r′|/c. This means that the ﬁelds at the ﬁeld point at time t depend on the charge
density and the current density at r′ at the retarded time tret ≡t −|r −r′|/c. The solutions of
the inhomogeneous wave equations, the so-called retarded potentials, are then

Magnetic dipole radiation term
A real example of an oscillating magnetic dipole is the magnetic dipole antenna which is sketched
in Fig. 5.7(b). The magnetic dipole term in the expansion for the vector potential is
A(r, t) = −ikµ0eikr
4πr
∫
(r · r′) J

(5.50)
and in Section 5.6 of “Essential Electromagnetism” I showed that

(5.51)
where
m = 1
2
∫
r ′ × J(r ′) d3r′
(5.52)
is the magnetic dipole moment. Hence, setting m = m0z = m0(cos θ r −sin θ θ) the vector
potential of an oscillating magnetic dipole moment is
A(r, t) = ikµ0eikr
4πr r × (m0 cos θ r −m0 sin θ θ) e−iωt

Radiation from quadrupole antennas
Magnetic quadrupole radiation may be produced by a pair of oppositely directed magnetic
dipole antennas, as sketched in Fig. 5.8. We may add the vector potentials of the two magnetic
dipoles taking account of the angle-dependent phase shift for each dipole. Looking at the paths
from the centres of the two AC current loops which comprise the radiating system, the wave
generated by the upper dipole travels a distance shorter by b/2 cos θ, and the wave generated by
the lower dipole travels a distance b/2 cos θ longer, compared to (ﬁctitious) waves from midway
between the centres of the current loops.

The radiation pattern for such an oscillating magnetic quadrupole is shown in Fig. 5.9 for three
values of b. For b = λ/2 we have the equivalent of a half-wave antenna and we see a fairly
standard quadrupole radiation pattern having two lobes at 50◦and 130◦. For larger b values
the radiation pattern becomes more complicated with the addition of “side-lobes”.
Electric
quadrupole radiation can be dealt with by similar methods, i.e. the superposition of a pair of
oppositely pointing oscillating electric dipoles.
5.7
Radiation from long antennas
In Section 2.2 we discussed standing waves on open-circuited transmission lines (Fig. 2.7).
Imagine pulling apart the ﬁnal quarter-wavelength of the line and stretching the ends apart
to become an antenna of length equal to half a wavelength, i.e. a “half-wave antenna” as in
Fig. 5.10. The current distribution on each line will be essentially unchanged, and so there will
be a standing sinusoidal wave on the antenna as shown. The only justiﬁcation of this procedure
is that for these current distributions on the antenna one can predict the radiation pattern
which is in agreement with that observed.

Current distributions and radiation patterns are given for standing-wave antennas for various
lengths in Fig. 5.12. Of particular interest is the half-wave antenna shown in Fig. 5.12(a) whose
radiation pattern can be approximated by that of an oscillating point electric dipole (dotted
curve).
As we move to longer dipoles (or shorter wavelengths) the antenna beam pattern
becomes more complicated and no longer resembles a dipole pattern, having only a weak lobe
at θ = 0 but having strong side-lobes.
Figure 5.12: Standing wave current distributions (left) and antenna radiation patterns (right)
are shown for antennas of various lengths. The current distributions are shown at t = 0 (red)
and at half a period later t = T/2 (blue dashed). The radiation patterns are normalised to
the maximum values. (a) d = λ/2 is the so-called half-wave antenna whose radiation pattern
resembles the sin2 θ dipole radiation pattern (dotted curve); (b) d = 3λ/2.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Fig. 5.13a) as the dotted blue curves, and is very diﬀerent to that calculated using Eq. 5.82
(red curves). The reason for this is in the use of a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the current appearing
in Ohm’s law. For the case of a short center-fed antenna the maximum current Imax is much
less than I0 which is the peak of the assumed sinusoidal standing wave — compare the peak
current Imax ≪I0 for d = 0.05λ with the peak currents Imax = I0 for d = 0.5λ and d = 0.85λ
shown in Fig. 5.13(b).
The antenna design will depend on the application, but to maximise the power radiated its
impedance Z = R + iX should ideally be purely resistive, i.e. the reactance X should be
negligible. The reactance X = ωL −1/ωC of an antenna depends on its dimensions and the
frequency, and is generally capacitive for short antennas and inductive for long antennas. In the
case where the reactance is non-zero the antenna can be made to radiate more ineﬃciently by
using impedance-matching techniques. Antenna design is an important topic in its own right
and contains many subtleties which we cannot go into in this book — here I have only skimmed
the surface.

Scattering
—
EM waves incident on a particle (or small object) will produce oscillating charges or
currents causing some of the incident radiation to be scattered (i.e. absorbed and re-
radiated).

The total cross section for scattering of EM waves is the time-averaged power re-radiated
divided by the time-averaged incident energy ﬂux.

Exercises on Chapter 5
5–1 A walkie-talkie has a short centre-fed dipole antenna 12 cm long and radiates 3 W at
450 MHz. Assume the antenna has been balanced by a suitable inductor such that its
impedance is purely resistive, and that the transmission line from the transceiver is matched
to the impedance of the antenna.
(a) What is the radiation resistance of the antenna?
(b) What is the value of the peak current in the antenna?
(c) What is the peak electric ﬁeld at the location of a receiving antenna at distance r?
(d) With the transmitting walkie-talkie held vertically, an identical receiving walkie-talkie
also held vertically at a distance of 2 km away can barely receive the transmission, i.e.
the range is 2 km. What would be the range if: (i) the transmitting antenna were tilted
at 60◦towards the receiving antenna, (ii) the transmitting antenna was vertical but the
receiving antenna was tilted at 60◦towards the transmitting antenna, (iii) the transmitting
antenna was vertical but the receiving antenna was tilted at 60◦to the vertical in a plane
perpendicular to the line of sight to the transmitting walkie-talkie?

5–4 In the presence of an applied uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = B0z a perfectly-conducting sphere
(radius a) acquires a magnetic dipole moment m0.
(a) What are the boundary conditions at the surface of the sphere? Find the magnetic
dipole moment that, together with the applied magnetic ﬁeld, satisﬁes the boundary con-
ditions.
(b) Find the contribution of magnetic dipole radiation to the cross section for scattering
of monochromatic EM waves by a perfectly-conducting sphere of radius a ≪λ.
5–5 In bremsstrahlung an energetic electron is accelerated in the electric ﬁeld of an atomic
nucleus and emits electromagnetic radiation. Consider the case of an electron of kinetic
energy 10 keV travelling on a trajectory parallel to the z-axis, and that there is a lead
(Pb) nucleus located at impact parameter b = 10−10 m (distance of closest approach to
the initial trajectory). Assume that for this impact parameter the electron’s deﬂection is
small, and that a calculation of the energy lost to electromagnetic radiation can be done
classically.
(a) By comparing b with the de Broglie wavelength h/mv, reassure yourself that a classical
calculation is valid for this impact parameter and velocity.

5–6 A pulsar is a rapidly-spinning magnetised neutron star observed at radio and sometimes
higher (optical, X-ray and gamma-ray) frequencies. Neutron stars have masses of typically
M ∼1.4 M⊙(solar mass 1 M⊙≈2 × 1030 kg), radius R ≈10 km, moment of inertia
IMoI = 2
5MR2 ≈1038 kg m2 and a wide range of surface magnetic ﬁelds. Outside the
neutron star the magnetic ﬁeld may be approximated by that of a magnetic dipole at its
centre making angle α to the spin axis. Pulsars typically emit one or more narrow pulses
at the same time into each spin period P, and measurements at diﬀerent epochs generally
show that the spin is slowing down as characterised by the time-derivative of the period ˙P.
(a) Derive formulae in terms of P and ˙P for the rotational kinetic energy Erot, the rate
of loss of rotational kinetic energy ˙Erot, the pulsar’s characteristic age τ = Erot/ ˙Erot and,
assuming the slow-down is due to conversion of rotational kinetic energy to magnetic dipole
radiation, the pulsar’s minimum equatorial surface magnetic ﬁeld Bmin.
(b) The radio pulsar PSR J0157+6212 has P = 2.355 s and ˙P = 1.89 × 10−13 (“The
Australia Telescope National Facility Pulsar Catalogue”, Manchester, R.N., et al., 2005,
Astron. J., 129, 1993, and http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/). Find Erot,

SI units and dimensions
The SI base units are: the metre (m) which is the unit of length, the kilogram (kg) which is the
unit of mass, the amp (A) which is the unit of electrical current, the second (s) which is the
unit of time, the kelvin (K) which is the unit of thermodynamic temperature, the mole (mol)
which is the unit of the amount of substance, the candela (cd) which is the unit of luminous
intensity.
In any derivation it is important to check that the dimensions are the same on both sides of an
equation. For this we will need the dimensions of electromagnetic quantities in terms of mass,
distance, time and amps, or equivalently the units in terms of the SI base units.
The units and dimensions of the major electromagnetic quantities are tabulated below. [See

formula for the Maxwell stress tensor, i.e. Tij in Eq. 1.54, which must therefore satisfy
