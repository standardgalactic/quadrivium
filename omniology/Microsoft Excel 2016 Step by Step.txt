Introduction
Welcome! This Step by Step book has been designed so you can read it from the 
beginning to learn about Microsoft Excel 2016 and then build your skills as you learn 
to perform increasingly specialized procedures. Or, if you prefer, you can jump in wher­
ever you need ready guidance for performing tasks. The how-to steps are delivered 
crisply and concisely—just the facts. You’ll also find informative, full-color graphics 
that support the instructional content.
Who this book is for
Microsoft Excel 2016 Step by Step is designed for use as a learning and reference 
resource by home and business users of Microsoft Office apps who want to use Excel 
to manage their data, create useful analyses and visualizations, and discover insights 
into their operations by using the rich business intelligence analysis tools found in Excel. 
The content of the book is designed to be useful for people who have previously used 
earlier versions of Excel and for people who are discovering Excel for the first time.
The Step by Step approach
The book’s coverage is divided into parts representing general Excel skill sets. Each 
part is divided into chapters representing skill set areas, and each chapter is divided 
into topics that group related skills. Each topic includes expository information fol­
lowed by generic procedures. At the end of the chapter, you’ll find a series of practice 
tasks you can complete on your own by using the skills taught in the chapter. You can 
use the practice files that are available from this book’s website to work through the 
practice tasks, or you can use your own files.
xiii

Download the practice files
Before you can complete the practice tasks in this book, you need to download the 
book’s practice files to your computer from http://aka.ms/Excel2016SBS/files. Follow 
the instructions on the webpage.
IMPORTANT  Excel 2016 is not available from the book’s website. You should install 
that app before working through the procedures and practice tasks in this book.
You can open the files that are supplied for the practice tasks and save the finished 
versions of each file. If you later want to repeat practice tasks, you can download the 
original practice files again.

Introduction

Adapt exercise steps
This book contains many images of the Excel user interface elements (such as the 
ribbon and the app window) that you’ll work with while performing tasks in Excel on 
a Windows computer. Unless we’re demonstrating an alternative view of content, the 
screen shots shown in this book were captured on a horizontally oriented display at a 
screen resolution of 1920 × 1080 and a magnification of 100 percent. If your settings 
are different, the ribbon on your screen might not look the same as the one shown 
in this book. As a result, exercise instructions that involve the ribbon might require a 
little adaptation.
Simple procedural instructions use this format:
1.	 On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, click the Chart button.
If the command is in a list, our instructions use this format:
1.	 On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the Find arrow and then, in the 
Find list, click Go To.
If differences between your display settings and ours cause a button to appear differ­
ently on your screen than it does in this book, you can easily adapt the steps to locate 
the command. First click the specified tab, and then locate the specified group. If a 
group has been collapsed into a group list or under a group button, click the list or 
button to display the group’s commands. If you can’t immediately identify the button 
you want, point to likely candidates to display their names in ScreenTips.
Introduction
xviii

Multistep procedural instructions use this format:
1.	 To select the paragraph that you want to format in columns, triple-click the 
paragraph.
2.	 On the Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, click the Columns button to 
­display a menu of column layout options.
3.	 On the Columns menu, click Three.
On subsequent instances of instructions that require you to follow the same process, 
the instructions might be simplified in this format because the working location has 
already been established:
1.	 Select the paragraph that you want to format in columns.
2.	 On the Columns menu, click Three.
The instructions in this book assume that you’re interacting with on-screen elements 
on your computer by clicking (with a mouse, touchpad, or other hardware device). If 
you’re using a different method—for example, if your computer has a touchscreen 
interface and you’re tapping the screen (with your finger or a stylus)—substitute the 
applicable tapping action when you interact with a user interface element. 
Instructions in this book refer to Excel user interface elements that you click or tap on

For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the Excel2016SBS\Ch01 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
When you create a new Excel 2016 workbook, the app 
presents a blank workbook that contains one worksheet. 
You can add or delete worksheets, hide worksheets 
within the workbook without deleting them, and change 
the order of your worksheets within the workbook. You 
can also copy a worksheet to another workbook or move 
the worksheet without leaving a copy of the worksheet in 
the first workbook. If you and your colleagues work with 
a large number of documents, you can define property 
values to make your workbooks easier to find when you 
and your colleagues attempt to locate them by using the 
Windows search box.
Another way to make Excel easier to use is by custom­
izing the Excel app window to fit your work style. If you 
find that you use a command frequently, you can add it 
to the Quick Access Toolbar so it’s never more than one 
click away. If you use a set of commands frequently, you 
can create a custom ribbon tab so they appear in one 
place. You can also hide, display, or change the order of 
the tabs on the ribbon.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating and modifying workbooks, creating and modi­
fying worksheets, merging and unmerging cells, and 
customizing the Excel 2016 app window.

Explore the editions of Excel 2016
The Microsoft Office 2016 suite includes apps that give you the ability to create and 
manage every type of file you need to work effectively at home, business, or school. 
The apps include Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote, and 
Publisher. You can purchase the apps as part of a package that includes multiple apps 
or purchase most of the apps individually.
By using the Office 2016 apps, you can find the tools you need quickly and, because 
they were designed as an integrated package, you’ll find that the skills you learn in 
one app transfer readily to the others. That flexibility extends well beyond your per­
sonal computer. In addition to the traditional desktop edition of Excel, you can also 
use Excel Online in combination with Microsoft OneDrive (formerly called SkyDrive).
Excel 2016
The desktop version of Excel 2016 is installed directly on your computer. The desk­
top version of the app includes all of the capabilities built into Excel 2016. You can 
purchase Excel 2016 as part of an Office app suite, as a separate app, or as part of the 
Office 365 subscription package that lets you install the desktop versions of Office 
apps for both PCs and Macs over the Internet.
TIP  Office 365 is a cloud-based subscription licensing solution. There are Office 365 
subscription levels that provide access to the full version of Excel 2016, Excel Online, 
or both. 
Excel Online
Information workers require their data to be available to them at all times, not just 
when they’re using their personal computers. To provide mobile workers with access 
to their data, Microsoft developed Office Online, which includes online versions of 
Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Office Online is available as part of 
an Office 365 subscription or for free as part of the OneDrive cloud service.
Chapter 1: Set up a workbook

You can use Excel Online to edit files stored in your OneDrive account or on a ­Microsoft 
SharePoint site. Excel Online displays your Excel 2010 and later files as they appear in the 
desktop version of the app and includes all of the functions you use to summarize your 
data. You can also view and manipulate PivotTables, add charts, and format your data to 
communicate its meaning clearly.
You can also use Excel Online to share your workbooks online, embed them as part of 
another webpage, and create web-accessible surveys that save user responses directly 
to an Excel workbook in your OneDrive account.
After you open a file by using Excel Online, you can choose to continue editing the 
file in your browser or open the file in the desktop app. When you open the file in 
your desktop app, any changes you save are written to the version of the file on your 
­OneDrive account. This practice means that you will always have access to the most 
recent version of your file, regardless of where and how you access it.
At the time of this writing, Office Online is compatible with Microsoft Edge, Internet 
Explorer 7 and later, Firefox 3.5 and later, and Chrome 3 and later for Windows. You 
can also use Office Online on a Mac if you have Safari 4 or later and on Linux with 
Chrome 3 or later. 
Excel Mobile Apps
In addition to providing versions of Excel 2016 for your PC, Mac, or for use online, 
Microsoft also maintains versions of Excel for many mobile platforms. If you own 
a Windows-based tablet, you can take advantage of the Office 2016 apps, all of 
which require Windows 7 or later. Office Mobile apps (Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, 
­PowerPoint Mobile, and OneNote Mobile) require Windows 10.
For other platforms, Office for iPad and Office for iPhone require iOS 7.0 or later. If 
you own an Android device, Office for Android can be installed on tablets and phones 
that are running Android KitKat 4.4 or later and have an ARM-based or Intel x86 
processor.

Become familiar with new features in 
Excel 2016
Excel 2016 includes all of the most useful capabilities included in previous versions of 
the app. If you’ve used an earlier version of Excel, you probably want to know about 
the new features introduced in Excel 2016, which include: 
■
■
Tell Me  Excel 2016 is a rich, powerful app, so it can be hard to remember 
everything you can do. If you want to search for instructions on how to perform 
an action, enter what you want to do in the new Tell Me box on the ribbon and 
press the Enter key to get the information you need.
■
■
New chart types  Excel 2016 introduces six new types of charts: waterfall, histo­
gram, Pareto, box-and-whisker, treemap, and sunburst. Each of these new chart 
types enhances your ability to summarize your data and convey meaningful 
information about your business.
■
■
Slicer multi-select  Slicers provide a visual reference to filters you have applied 
to Excel tables and PivotTables. In Excel 2013, you had to use the Ctrl and Shift 
keys to select multiple values. In Excel 2016, you can click the Multi-Select button 
on the Slicer title bar to enable multiple selections without using the Ctrl or 
Shift key when you make your selections.
■
■
Math entry  In Excel 2016, Word 2016, and PowerPoint 2016, you can now enter a 
mathematical formula into a file by using a stylus or a finger on a touch-sensitive 
device. Entering mathematical notation directly supplements the built-in Equa­
tion Editor and could save you significant time.
■
■
Insights for Office  Insights help you learn more about your content through 
sources such as Bing Snapshot, Wikipedia, Bing image search, and the Oxford 
dictionary.

Create workbooks
Every time you want to gather and store data that isn’t closely related to any of your 
other existing data, you should create a new workbook. The default new workbook in 
Excel has one worksheet, although you can add more worksheets if you want. When 
you start Excel, Excel displays the Start screen.
Create new workbooks from the Start screen
You can click one of the built-in templates available in Excel 2016 or create a blank 
workbook. You can then begin to enter data into the worksheet’s cells or open an 
existing workbook. After you start entering workbook values, you can save your work.
TIP  To save your workbook by using a keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl+S. For more infor­
mation about keyboard shortcuts, see “Keyboard shortcuts” at the end of this book.
Create workbooks

IMPORTANT  Readers frequently ask, “How often should I save my files?” It is good 
practice to save your changes every half hour or even every five minutes, but the best 
time to save a file is whenever you make a change that you would hate to have to make again.
When you save a file, you overwrite the previous copy of the file. If you have made 
changes that you want to save, but you also want to keep a copy of the file as it was 
when you saved it previously, you can save your file under a new name or in a new 
folder.
TIP  To open the Save As dialog box by using a keyboard shortcut, press F12. 
You also can use the controls in the Save As dialog box to specify a different format 
for the new file and a different location in which to save the new version of the file. For 
example, if you work with a colleague who requires data saved in the Excel 97-2003 file 
format, you can save a file in that format from within the Save As dialog box.
If you want to work with a file you created previously, you can open it by displaying 
the Open page of the Backstage view.
TIP  To display the Open page of the Backstage view by using a keyboard shortcut, 
press Ctrl+O.
After you create a file, you can add information to make the file easier to find when 
you use the Windows search box to search for it. Each category of information, or 
property, stores specific information about your file. In Windows, you can search for 
files based on the file’s author or title, or by keywords associated with the file.

Assign properties to help locate workbooks on your server
In addition to setting property values on the Info page of the Backstage view, you can 
display the Properties dialog box to select one of the existing custom categories or 
create your own. You can also edit your properties or delete any you no longer want 
to use. 
When you’re done modifying a workbook, you should save your changes and then 
close the file.
TIP  To close a workbook by using a keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl+W.

Modify workbooks
You can use Excel workbooks to record information about specific business activities. 
Each worksheet within that workbook should represent a subdivision of that activity. 
To display a particular worksheet, just click the worksheet’s tab (also called a sheet 
tab) on the tab bar (just below the grid of cells). You can also create new worksheets 
when you need them.
Display and create worksheets without leaving the main app window
When you create a worksheet, Excel assigns it a generic name such as Sheet2, Sheet3, 
or Sheet4. After you decide what type of data you want to store on a worksheet, you 
should change the worksheet’s name to something more descriptive. You can also 
move and copy worksheets within and between workbooks. Moving a worksheet 
within a workbook changes its position, whereas moving a worksheet to another 
workbook removes it from the original workbook. Copying a worksheet keeps the 
original in its position and creates a second copy in the new location, whether within 
the same workbook or in another workbook.
TIP  Selecting the Create A Copy check box in the Move Or Copy dialog box leaves the 
copied worksheet in its original workbook, whereas clearing the check box causes Excel 
to delete the worksheet from its original workbook.
Modify workbooks
13

Move or copy worksheets within and among workbooks
TIP  You can also copy a worksheet within a workbook by holding down the Ctrl key 
while dragging the worksheet’s tab to a new position in the workbook.
After the worksheet is in the target workbook, you can change the worksheet’s posi­
tion within the workbook, hide its tab on the tab bar without deleting the worksheet, 
unhide its tab, or change the sheet tab’s color.
TIP  If you copy a worksheet to another workbook and the destination workbook has 
the same Office Theme applied as the active workbook, the worksheet retains its tab 
color. If the destination workbook has another theme applied, the worksheet’s tab color 
changes to reflect that theme. For more information about Office themes, see Chapter 4, 
“Change workbook appearance.”
If you determine that you no longer need a particular worksheet, such as one you 
created to store some figures temporarily, you can delete the worksheet quickly.

2.	 If Excel displays a confirmation dialog box, click Delete.
TIP  Excel displays a confirmation dialog box when you start to delete a work-
sheet that contains data.
Modify worksheets
After you put up the signposts that make your data easy to find, you can take other 
steps to make the data in your workbooks easier to work with. For example, you can 
change the width of a column or the height of a row in a worksheet by dragging the 
column’s right border or the row’s bottom border to the position you want. Increasing 
a column’s width or a row’s height increases the space between cell contents, making 
your data easier to read and work with.
TIP  You can apply the same change to more than one row or column by selecting 
the rows or columns you want to change and then dragging the border of one of the 
selected rows or columns to the location you want. When you release the mouse button, all 
the selected rows or columns change to the new height or width.
Modifying column width and row height can make a workbook’s contents easier to 
work with, but you can also insert a row or column between cells that contain data to 
make your data easier to read. Adding space between the edge of a worksheet and 
cells that contain data, or perhaps between a label and the data to which it refers, 
makes the workbook’s contents less crowded. 
TIP  Inserting a column adds a column to the left of the selected column or columns. 
Inserting a row adds a row above the selected row or rows.
Chapter 1: Set up a workbook

When you insert a row, column, or cell in a worksheet that has had formatting 
applied, the Insert Options action button appears. Clicking the Insert Options button 
displays a list of choices you can make about how the inserted row or column should 
be formatted. The following table summarizes these options.
Option
Action
Format Same As Above
Applies the formatting of the row above the 
inserted row to the new row
Format Same As Below
Applies the formatting of the row below the 
inserted row to the new row
Format Same As Left
Applies the formatting of the column to the left of 
the inserted column to the new column
Format Same As Right
Applies the formatting of the column to the right of 
the inserted column to the new column
Clear Formatting
Applies the default format to the new row or column
You can also delete, hide, and unhide columns. Deleting a column removes it and its 
contents from the worksheet entirely, whereas hiding a column or row removes it 
from the display without deleting its contents.
IMPORTANT  If you hide the first row or column in a worksheet and then want to unhide 
it, you must click the Select All button in the upper-left corner of the worksheet (above the 
first row header and to the left of the first column header) or press Ctrl+A to select the entire 
worksheet. Then, on the Home tab, in the Cells group, click Format, point to Hide & Unhide, and 
then click either Unhide Rows or Unhide Columns to make the hidden data visible again.
Just as you can insert rows or columns, you can insert individual cells into a work­
sheet. After you insert cells, you can choose whether to shift the cells surrounding the 
inserted cell down (if your data is arranged as a column) or to the right (if your data is 
arranged as a row). 
Modify worksheets
19

TIP  The Insert dialog box also includes options you can click to insert a new row or 
column; the Delete dialog box has similar options for deleting an entire row or column.
If you want to move the data in a group of cells to another location in your worksheet, 
select the cells you want to move and then point to the selection’s border. When the 
pointer changes to a four-pointed arrow, you can drag the selected cells to the target 
location on the worksheet. If the destination cells contain data, Excel displays a dialog 
box asking whether you want to overwrite the destination cells’ contents. You can 
choose to overwrite the data or cancel the move.
To change row height
1.	 Select the row headers for the rows you want to resize.
2.	 Point to the bottom border of a selected row header.
3.	 When the pointer changes to a double-headed vertical arrow, drag the border 
until the row is the height you want.
Or

4.	 If necessary, click OK to confirm that you want to delete data in the target cells.
Merge and unmerge cells
Most Excel worksheets contain data about a specific subject. One of the best ways to 
communicate the contents of a worksheet is to use a label. 
Merge and unmerge cells
23

Merge and center cell contents to create effective labels
For example, consider a worksheet in which the label text Distribution Center Hubs 
appears to span three cells, B2:D2, but is in fact contained within cell B2. If you select 
cell B2, Excel highlights the cell’s border, which obscures the text. If you want to com­
bine cells B2:D2 into a single cell, you can do so by merging the cells into a single cell.

IMPORTANT  When you merge two or more cells, Excel retains just the text in the 
range’s upper-left cell. All other text is deleted.
When you click the Merge & Center button, a list of options appears. In addition to 
merging cells, you can click Merge & Center to combine the selected cells into a single 
cell and center the text within the merged cell. You should strongly consider using the 
Merge & Center option for label text, such as above a list of data where the title spans 
more than one column. You can also merge the cells in multiple rows at the same time 
by using Merge Across.
Merge cells in multiple rows by using Merge Across
IMPORTANT  Selecting the header cells, clicking the Home tab, clicking Merge & Center, 
and then clicking either Merge & Center or Merge Cells will delete any text that is not in 
the upper-left cell of the selected range.
If you want to split merged cells into their individual cells, you can always 
unmerge them.

Customize the Excel 2016 app window
How you use Excel 2016 depends on your personal working style and the type of data 
collections you manage. The Excel product team interviews customers, observes how 
differing organizations use the app, and sets up the user interface so that many users 
won’t need to change it to work effectively. If you do want to change the Excel app 
window, including the user interface, you can. You can change how Excel displays 
your worksheets; zoom in on worksheet data; add frequently used commands to the 
Quick Access Toolbar; hide, display, and reorder ribbon tabs; and create custom tabs 
to make groups of commands readily accessible.
Zoom in on a worksheet
One way to make Excel easier to work with is to change the app’s zoom level. Just 
as you can “zoom in” with a camera to increase the size of an object in the camera’s 
viewer, you can use the zoom setting to change the size of objects within the Excel 
2016 app window. You can change the zoom level from the ribbon or by using the 
Zoom control in the lower-right corner of the Excel 2016 window.

Change worksheet magnification by using the Zoom control
The minimum zoom level in Excel 2016 is 10 percent; the maximum is 400 percent.
To zoom in on a worksheet
1.	 Using the Zoom control in the lower-right corner of the app window, click the 
Zoom In button (which looks like a plus sign).
To zoom out on a worksheet
1.	 Using the Zoom control in the lower-right corner of the app window, click the 
Zoom Out button (which looks like a minus sign).
To set the zoom level to 100 percent
1.	 On the View tab of the ribbon, in the Zoom group, click the 100% button.

To zoom in on specific worksheet highlights
1.	 Select the cells you want to zoom in on.
2.	 In the Zoom group, click the Zoom to Selection button.
Arrange multiple workbook windows
As you work with Excel, you will probably need to have more than one workbook 
open at a time. For example, you could open a workbook that contains customer 
contact information and copy it into another workbook to be used as the source data 
for a mass mailing you create in Word 2016. When you have multiple workbooks open 
simultaneously, you can switch between them or arrange your workbooks on the 
desktop so that most of the active workbook is shown prominently but the others are 
easily accessible. 
Arrange multiple Excel windows to make them easier to access
Many Excel 2016 workbooks contain formulas on one worksheet that derive their 
value from data on another worksheet, which means you need to change between 
two worksheets every time you want to see how modifying your data changes the 
formula’s result. However, an easier way to approach this is to display two copies of 
the same workbook simultaneously, displaying the worksheet that contains the data 
in the original window and displaying the worksheet with the formula in the new 
window. When you change the data in either copy of the workbook, Excel updates 
the other copy. 
Chapter 1: Set up a workbook

If the original workbook’s name is Merge Cells, Excel 2016 displays the name Merge 
Cells:1 on the original workbook’s title bar and Merge Cells:2 on the second work­
book’s title bar.

Add buttons to the Quick Access Toolbar
As you continue to work with Excel 2016, you might discover that you use certain 
commands much more frequently than others. If your workbooks draw data from 
external sources, for example, you might find yourself using certain ribbon buttons 
much more often than the app’s designers might have expected. You can make any 
button accessible with one click by adding the button to the Quick Access Toolbar, 
located just above the ribbon in the upper-left corner of the Excel app window. You’ll 
find the tools you need to change the buttons on the Quick Access Toolbar in the 
Excel Options dialog box.
Control which buttons appear on the Quick Access Toolbar
Chapter 1: Set up a workbook

You can add buttons to the Quick Access Toolbar, change their positions, and remove 
them when you no longer need them. Later, if you want to return the Quick Access 
Toolbar to its original state, you can reset just the Quick Access Toolbar or the entire 
ribbon interface.
You can also choose whether your Quick Access Toolbar changes affect all your work­
books or just the active workbook. If you’d like to export your Quick Access Toolbar 
customizations to a file that can be used to apply those changes to another Excel 2016 
installation, you can do so quickly.
To add a button to the Quick Access Toolbar
1.	 Display the Backstage view, and then click Options.
2.	 In the Excel Options dialog box, click Quick Access Toolbar.
3.	 If necessary, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar arrow and select 
whether to apply the change to all documents or just the current document.

Customize the ribbon
Excel 2016 enhances your ability to customize the entire ribbon: you can hide and 
­display ribbon tabs, reorder tabs displayed on the ribbon, customize existing tabs 
(including tool tabs, which appear when specific items are selected), and create cus­
tom tabs. You’ll find the tools to customize the ribbon in the Excel Options dialog box.
Control which items appear on the ribbon by using the Excel Options dialog box
Customize the Excel 2016 app window
33

From the Customize Ribbon page of the Excel Options dialog box, you can select 
which tabs appear on the ribbon and in what order. Each ribbon tab’s name has a 
check box next to it. If a tab’s check box is selected, that tab appears on the ribbon. 
Just as you can change the order of the tabs on the ribbon, with Excel 2016, you 
can change the order in which groups of commands appear on a tab. For example, 
the Page Layout tab contains five groups: Themes, Page Setup, Scale To Fit, Sheet 
Options, and Arrange. If you use the Themes group less frequently than the other 
groups, you could move the group to the right end of the tab.
Change the order of items on built-in ribbon tabs
You can also remove groups from a ribbon tab. If you remove a group from a built-
in tab and later decide you want to restore it, you can put it back without too much 
worry.
The built-in ribbon tabs are designed efficiently, so adding new command groups 
might crowd the other items on the tab and make those controls harder to find. 
Rather than adding controls to an existing ribbon tab, you can create a custom tab 
and then add groups and commands to it. The default New Tab (Custom) name 
doesn’t tell you anything about the commands on your new ribbon tab, so you can 
rename it to reflect its contents. 
You can export your ribbon customizations to a file that can be used to apply those 
changes to another Excel 2016 installation. When you’re ready to apply saved custom­
izations to Excel, import the file and apply it. And, as with the Quick Access Toolbar, 
you can always reset the ribbon to its original state.
The ribbon is designed to use space efficiently, but you can hide it and other user 
interface elements such as the formula bar and row and column headings if you want 
to increase the amount of space available inside the app window.
TIP  Press Ctrl+F1 to hide and unhide the ribbon.

With Excel 2016, you can visualize and present informa­
tion effectively by using charts, graphics, and formatting, 
but the data is the most important part of any workbook. 
By learning to enter data efficiently, you will make fewer 
data entry errors and give yourself more time to analyze 
your data so you can make decisions about your organi­
zation’s performance and direction.
Excel provides a wide variety of tools you can use to enter 
and manage worksheet data effectively. For example, you 
can organize your data into Excel tables so that you can 
store and analyze your data quickly and efficiently. Also, 
you can enter a data series quickly; repeat one or more 
values; and control how Excel formats cells, columns, 
and rows that you move from one part of a worksheet 
to another; all with a minimum of effort. With Excel, you 
can check the spelling of worksheet text, look up alterna­
tive words by using the thesaurus, and translate words to 
foreign languages.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
entering and revising Excel data, moving data within a 
workbook, finding and replacing existing data, using 
proofing and reference tools to enhance your data, and 
organizing your data by using Excel tables.
43

Enter and revise data
After you create a workbook, you can begin entering data. The simplest way to enter 
data is to click a cell and type a value. This method works very well when you’re enter­
ing a few pieces of data, but it is less than ideal when you’re entering long sequences 
or series of values. For example, you could create a worksheet tracking each custom­
er’s monthly program savings.
Store important business data in your worksheets
TIP  To cancel data entry and return a cell to its previous state, press Esc. 
Repeatedly entering the sequence January, February, March, and so on can be handled 
by copying and pasting the first occurrence of the sequence, but there’s an easier way 
to do it: use AutoFill. With AutoFill, you enter the first element in a recognized series, 
and then drag the fill handle in the lower-right corner of the cell until the series extends 
far enough to accommodate your data. By using a similar tool, FillSeries, you can enter 
two values in a series and use the fill handle to extend the series in your worksheet. 
You do have some control over how Excel extends the values in a series when you 
drag the fill handle. If you drag the fill handle up (or to the left), Excel extends the 
series to include previous values. For example, if you enter January in a cell and then 
drag that cell’s fill handle up (or to the left), Excel places December in the first cell, 
November in the second cell, and so on.
44
Chapter 2: Work with data and Excel tables

2
Another way to control how Excel extends a data series is by holding down the Ctrl 
key while you drag the fill handle. If you select a cell that contains the value January 
and then drag the fill handle down, Excel extends the series by placing February in the 
next cell, March in the cell after that, and so on. If you hold down the Ctrl key while 
you drag the fill handle, however, Excel repeats the value January in each cell you add 
to the series.
TIP  Experiment with how the fill handle extends your series and how pressing the Ctrl 
key changes that behavior. Using the fill handle can save you a lot of time entering data.
Other data entry techniques you’ll learn about in this topic are AutoComplete, which 
detects when a value you’re entering is similar to previously entered values; Pick 
From Drop-Down List, which you can use to choose a value from among the existing 
values in a column; and Ctrl+Enter, which you can use to enter a value in multiple cells 
simultaneously.
TIP  If an AutoComplete suggestion doesn’t appear as you begin entering a cell value, 
the option might be turned off. To turn on AutoComplete, display the Backstage view, 
and then click Options. In the Excel Options dialog box, display the Advanced page. In the 
Editing Options section, select the Enable AutoComplete For Cell Values check box, and then 
click OK.
The following table summarizes these data entry techniques.
Method
Action
AutoFill
Enter the first value in a recognized series and drag the fill 
handle to extend the series.
FillSeries
Enter the first two values in a series and drag the fill 
handle to extend the series.
AutoComplete
Enter the first few letters in a cell. If a similar value exists in 
the same column, Excel suggests the existing value.
Pick From Drop-Down List
Right-click a cell, and then click Pick From Drop-Down List. 
A list of existing values in the cell’s column is displayed. 
Click the value you want to enter into the cell.
Ctrl+Enter
When you want several cells to all contain the same data, 
select the range, enter the data in the active cell, and 
press Ctrl+Enter.
45
Enter and revise data

Another handy feature in Excel is the AutoFill Options button that appears next to 
data you add to a worksheet by using the fill handle.
Use AutoFill options to control how the fill handle affects your data
Clicking the AutoFill Options button displays a menu of actions Excel can take regard­
ing the cells affected by your fill operation. The options on the menu are summarized 
in the following table.
Option
Action
Copy Cells
Copies the contents of the selected cells to the cells 
indicated by the fill operation.
Fill Series
Fills the cells indicated by the fill operation with the next 
items in the series.
Fill Formatting Only
Copies the format of the selected cells to the cells indicated 
by the fill operation, but does not place any values in the 
target cells.
Fill Without Formatting
Fills the cells indicated by the fill operation with the next 
items in the series, but ignores any formatting applied to 
the source cells.
Fill Days, Weekdays, and so on
The appearance of this option changes according to the 
series you extend. For example, if you extend the values 
Wed, Thu, and Fri, Excel presents two options, Fill Days 
and Fill Weekdays, and you can select which one you 
intended. If you do not use a recognized sequence, this 
option does not appear.
Flash Fill
Enters values based on patterns established in other cells 
in the column.

Manage data by using Flash Fill
When you manage data in Excel, you will often find that you want to combine values 
from several cells into a single value. One common data configuration is to have a 
customer’s first name and last name in separate cells.
Fill in data according to a pattern by using Flash Fill
In this example, the contacts’ names appear in three columns: LastName, FirstName, 
and Initial. Note that not every contact has a middle initial. You could combine the 
names manually or by creating a formula, but Flash Fill can figure out the pattern if 
you give it a few examples.
Flash Fill suggests values if it detects a pattern in your data
48
Chapter 2: Work with data and Excel tables

2
Note that Flash Fill did not include the middle initials in any row due to the lack of an 
initial in some of the rows. If you click in the FullName cell next to a row that contains 
an Initial value and edit the name as you would like it to appear, Flash Fill recognizes 
the new pattern for this subset of the data and offers to fill in the values. You can 
press Enter to accept the values Flash Fill suggests.
Edit a Flash Fill value to add data to the pattern
Flash Fill also lets you fix errors in your data. One common issue occurs when you try 
to enter numbers with leading zeros, such as United States postal codes, into cells for­
matted as General or with a number format. If you enter a zero-leading number into 
such a cell, Excel removes the zero.
Use Flash Fill to correct common data-entry issues
To fix this error, you would select the cells that contain the postal codes and format 
the cells as text. Then, in the blank cell next to the first postal code that should have 
a leading zero, enter the postal code as it should appear, and press Enter. When you 
start entering the postal code into the second cell, Flash Fill offers to change the data 
by adding a zero to every value in the list.
49
Manage data by using Flash Fill

Flash Fill can overgeneralize the rule it applies to your data
The logic behind Flash Fill guessed that you wanted to add a zero to every postal 
code, but this change is incorrect for any value that should start with a number other 
than zero. To correct this, after you accept the values Flash Fill suggests, you would 
move to a blank cell next to a postal code that shouldn’t start with a zero and enter 
the correct value. When you do, Flash Fill updates its logic to suggest the correct 
values.
Correct Flash Fill changes to fix your data
TIP  The error icon indicates that you have stored a number as text. Because you won’t 
be performing any mathematical operations on the postal code numbers, you can 
ignore the error.
To enter data by using Flash Fill
1.	 In a cell on the same row as data that can be combined or split, enter the result 
you want for that row’s data, and press Enter.
2.	 In the cell directly below the first cell into which you entered data, start entering a 
new value for the row.
3.	 Press Enter to accept the suggested values.
50
Chapter 2: Work with data and Excel tables

2
To correct a Flash Fill entry
1.	 Create a series of Flash Fill values in a worksheet.
2.	 Edit a cell that contains an incorrect Flash Fill value that so it contains the 
­correct value.
3.	 Press Enter.
Move data within a workbook
You can move to a specific cell in lots of ways, but the most direct method is to start 
by clicking the cell with the contents you want to move. The cell you click will be 
outlined in black, and its contents, if any, will appear in the formula bar. When a cell 
is outlined, it is the active cell, meaning that you can modify its contents. You use a 
similar method to select multiple cells (referred to as a cell range). After you select the 
cell or cells you want to work with, you can cut, copy, delete, or change the format of 
the contents of the cell or cells. 
IMPORTANT  When you select a group of cells, the first cell you click is designated as 
the active cell.
You’re not limited to selecting cells individually or as part of a range. For example, you 
might need to move a column of price data one column to the right to make room 
for a column of headings that indicate to which category a set of numbers belongs. 
To move an entire column (or entire columns) of data at a time, you click the column’s 
header, located at the top of the worksheet. Clicking a column header highlights 
every cell in that column so that you can copy or cut the column and paste it else­
where in the workbook. Similarly, clicking a row’s header highlights every cell in that 
row, so that you can copy or cut the row and paste it elsewhere in the workbook.
When you copy a cell, cell range, row, or column, Excel copies the cells’ contents and 
formatting. The Paste Live Preview capability in Excel displays what your pasted data 
will look like without forcing you to commit to the paste operation. 
51
Move data within a workbook

View live previews of your pasted data
If you point to one icon in the Paste gallery and then point to another icon without 
clicking, Excel will update the preview to reflect the new option. Depending on the 
cells’ contents, two or more of the paste options might lead to the same result.
TIP  If pointing to an icon in the Paste gallery doesn’t result in a live preview, that option 
might be turned off. To turn Paste Live Preview on, in the Backstage view, click Options 
to open the Excel Options dialog box. Click General, select the Enable Live Preview check box, 
and click OK.
After you click an icon to complete the paste operation, Excel displays the Paste 
Options button next to the pasted cells. Clicking the Paste Options button also dis­
plays the Paste Options palette, but pointing to one of those icons doesn’t generate a 
preview. If you want to display Paste Live Preview again, you will need to press Ctrl+Z 
to undo the paste operation and, if necessary, cut or copy the data again to use the 
icons in the Clipboard group of the Home tab.
TIP  If the Paste Options button doesn’t appear, you can turn the feature on by clicking 
Options in the Backstage view to open the Excel Options dialog box. In the Excel 
Options dialog box, display the Advanced page and then, in the Cut, Copy, And Paste area, 
select the Show Paste Options Button When Content Is Pasted check box. Click OK to close the 
dialog box and save your setting.

After cutting or copying data to the Clipboard, you can access additional paste 
options from the Paste gallery and from the Paste Special dialog box.
Use the Paste Special dialog box for uncommon paste operations
In the Paste Special dialog box, you can specify the aspect of the Clipboard contents 
you want to paste, restricting the pasted data to values, formats, comments, or one of 
several other options. You can perform mathematical operations involving the cut or 
copied data and the existing data in the cells you paste the content into, and you can 
transpose data—change rows to columns and columns to rows—when you paste it.

Find and replace data
Excel worksheets can hold more than one million rows of data, so in large data collec­
tions it’s unlikely that you would have the time to move through a worksheet one row 
at a time to locate the data you want to find. You can locate specific data in an Excel 
worksheet by using the Find And Replace dialog box, which has two tabs (one named 
Find, the other named Replace) that you can use to search for cells that contain par­
ticular values. Using the controls on the Find tab identifies cells that contain the data 
you specify; by using the controls on the Replace tab, you can substitute one value for 
another. 
TIP  To display the Find tab of the Find And Replace dialog box by using a keyboard 
shortcut, press Ctrl+F. Press Ctrl+H to display the Replace tab of the Find And Replace 
dialog box.
When you need more control over the data that you find and replace—for instance, if 
you want to find cells in which the entire cell value matches the value you’re searching 
for—you can expand the Find And Replace dialog box to display more options.
56

Correct and expand upon data
After you enter your data, you should take the time to check and correct it. You do 
need to verify visually that each piece of numeric data is correct, but you can make 
sure that your worksheet’s text is spelled correctly by using the Excel spelling checker. 
When the spelling checker encounters a word it doesn’t recognize, it highlights the 
word and offers suggestions representing its best guess of the correct word. You can 
then edit the word directly, pick the proper word from the list of suggestions, or have 
the spelling checker ignore the misspelling. You can also use the spelling checker to 
add new words to a custom dictionary so that Excel will recognize them later, saving 
you time by not requiring you to identify the words as correct every time they occur 
in your worksheets.
TIP  To start checking spelling by using a keyboard shortcut, press F7. 
After you make a change in a workbook, you can usually remove the change as long 
as you haven’t closed the workbook. You can even change your mind again if you 
decide you want to restore your change.

TIP  To undo an action by using a keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl+Z. To redo an action, 
press Ctrl+Y.
Excel 2016 includes a new capability called Smart Lookup, which lets you find informa­
tion relating to a highlighted word or phrase by using the Bing search engine. Excel 
displays the Insights task pane, which has two tabs: Explore and Define. The Explore tab 
displays search results from Wikipedia and other web resources. The Define tab displays 
definitions provided by OxfordDictionaries from Oxford University Press.
If you’re not sure of your word choice, or if you use a word that is almost but not quite 
right for your intended meaning, you can check for alternative words by using the 
thesaurus.

Define Excel tables
With Excel, you’ve always been able to manage lists of data effectively, so that you 
can sort your worksheet data based on the values in one or more columns, limit the 
data displayed by using criteria (for example, show only those routes with fewer than 
100 stops), and create formulas that summarize the values in visible (that is, unfiltered) 
cells. Excel 2016 provides those capabilities, and more, through Excel tables.
Manage data by using Excel tables
65
Define Excel tables

TIP  Sorting, filtering, and summarizing data are all covered elsewhere in this book. 
Excel can also create an Excel table from an existing cell range as long as the range 
has no blank rows or columns within the data and there is no extraneous data in cells 
immediately below or next to the list. If your existing data has formatting applied to 
it, that formatting remains applied to those cells when you create the Excel table, but 
you can have Excel replace the existing formatting with the Excel table’s formatting.
TIP  To create an Excel table by using a keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl+L and then 
click OK.
Entering values into a cell below or to the right of an Excel table adds a row or 
column to the Excel table. After you enter the value and move out of the cell, the 
AutoCorrect Options action button appears. If you didn’t mean to include the data 
in the Excel table, you can click Undo Table AutoExpansion to exclude the cells from 
the Excel table. If you never want Excel to include adjacent data in an Excel table 
again, click Stop Automatically Expanding Tables.
TIP  To stop Table AutoExpansion before it starts, click Options in the Backstage view. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click Proofing, and then click the AutoCorrect Options 
button to open the AutoCorrect dialog box. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab, clear the 
Include New Rows And Columns In Table check box, and then click OK twice.
You can resize an Excel table manually by using your mouse. If your Excel table’s 
headers contain a recognizable series of values (such as Region1, Region2, and 
Region3), and you drag the resize handle to create a fourth column, Excel creates 
the column with a label that is the next value in the series—in this example, Region4.
Excel tables often contain data you can summarize by calculating a sum or average, or 
by finding the maximum or minimum value in a column. To summarize one or more 
columns of data, you can add a total row to your Excel table.
66
Chapter 2: Work with data and Excel tables

2
An Excel table with a total row
When you add the total row, Excel creates a formula that summarizes the values in 
the rightmost Excel table column. You can change the summary function by picking 
a new one from the partial list displayed in the Excel table or by selecting a function 
from the full set.
Much as it does when you create a new worksheet, Excel gives your Excel tables 
generic names such as Table1 and Table2. You can change an Excel table’s name to 
something easier to recognize in your formulas. Changing an Excel table name might 
not seem important, but it helps make formulas that summarize Excel table data 
much easier to understand. You should make a habit of renaming your Excel tables so 
you can recognize the data they contain.
SEE ALSO  For more information about using the Insert Function dialog box and about 
referring to tables in formulas, see “Create formulas to calculate values” in Chapter 3, 
“Perform calculations on data.”

Excel 2016 workbooks give you a handy place to store 
and organize your data, but you can also do a lot more 
with your data in Excel. One important task you can 
perform is to calculate totals for the values in a series 
of related cells. You can also use Excel to discover other 
information about the data you select, such as the maxi­
mum or minimum value in a group of cells. Regardless of 
your needs, Excel gives you the ability to find the infor­
mation you want. And if you make an error, you can find 
the cause and correct it quickly.
Often, you can’t access the information you want without 
referencing more than one cell, and it’s also often true 
that you’ll use the data in the same group of cells for 
more than one calculation. Excel makes it easy to refer­
ence several cells at the same time, so that you can define 
your calculations quickly.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to streamlining references to groups of data on your 
worksheets and creating and correcting formulas that 
summarize an organization’s business operations.
73

Name groups of data
When you work with large amounts of data, it’s often useful to identify groups of cells 
that contain related data. For example, you can create a worksheet in which columns 
of cells contain data summarizing the number of packages handled during a specific 
time period and each row represents a region.
Worksheets often contain logical groups of data
Instead of specifying the cells individually every time you want to use the data 
they contain, you can define those cells as a range (also called a named range). For 
example, you can group the hourly packages handled in the Northeast region into a 
group called NortheastVolume. Whenever you want to use the contents of that range 
in a calculation, you can use the name of the range instead of specifying the range’s 
address.
TIP  Yes, you could just name the range Northeast, but if you use the range’s values in 
a formula in another worksheet, the more descriptive range name tells you and your 
colleagues exactly what data is used in the calculation.
If the cells you want to define as a named range have labels in a row or column that’s 
part of the cell group, you can use those labels as the names of the named ranges. For 
example, if your data appears in worksheet cells B4:I12 and the values in column B are 
the row labels, you can make each row its own named range.

Create formulas to calculate values
After you add your data to a worksheet and define ranges to simplify data references, 
you can create a formula, which is an expression that performs calculations on your 
data. For example, you can calculate the total cost of a customer’s shipments, figure 
the average number of packages for all Wednesdays in the month of January, or find 
the highest and lowest daily package volumes for a week, month, or year.
To write an Excel formula, you begin the cell’s contents with an equal (=) sign; Excel 
then knows that the expression following it should be interpreted as a calculation, not 
text. After the equal sign, you enter the formula. For example, you can find the sum of 
the numbers in cells C2 and C3 by using the formula =C2+C3. After you have entered 
a formula into a cell, you can revise it by clicking the cell and then editing the formula 
in the formula bar. For example, you can change the preceding formula to =C3–C2, 
which calculates the difference between the contents of cells C2 and C3.
IMPORTANT  If Excel treats your formula as text, make sure that you haven’t acciden-
tally put a space before the equal sign. Remember, the equal sign must be the first 
character!
Entering the cell references for 15 or 20 cells in a calculation would be tedious, 
but in Excel you can easily enter complex calculations by using the Insert Function 
dialog box. The Insert Function dialog box includes a list of functions, or predefined 
formulas, from which you can choose.
77
Create formulas to calculate values

Create formulas with help in the Insert Function dialog box
The following table describes some of the most useful functions in the list.
Function
Description
SUM
Finds the sum of the numbers in the specified cells
AVERAGE
Finds the average of the numbers in the specified cells
COUNT
Finds the number of entries in the specified cells
MAX
Finds the largest value in the specified cells
MIN
Finds the smallest value in the specified cells
Two other functions you might use are the NOW and PMT functions. The NOW func­
tion displays the time at which Excel updated the workbook’s formulas, so the value 
will change every time the workbook recalculates. The proper form for this function is 
=NOW(). You could, for example, use the NOW function to calculate the elapsed time 
from when you started a process to the present time.
78
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

3
The PMT function is a bit more complex. It calculates payments due on a loan, assum­
ing a constant interest rate and constant payments. To perform its calculations, the 
PMT function requires an interest rate, the number of payments, and the starting 
balance. The elements to be entered into the function are called arguments and must 
be entered in a certain order. That order is written as PMT(rate, nper, pv, fv, type). The 
following table summarizes the arguments in the PMT function.
Argument
Description
rate
The interest rate, to be divided by 12 for a loan with monthly 
payments, by 4 for quarterly payments, and so on
nper
The total number of payments for the loan
pv
The amount loaned (pv is short for present value, or principal)
fv
The amount to be left over at the end of the payment cycle (usually 
left blank, which indicates 0)
type
0 or 1, indicating whether payments are made at the beginning or at 
the end of the month (usually left blank, which indicates 0, or the end 
of the month)
If a company wanted to borrow $2,000,000 at a 6 percent interest rate and pay the 
loan back over 24 months, you could use the PMT function to figure out the monthly 
payments. In this case, you would write the function =PMT(6%/12, 24, 2000000), 
which calculates a monthly payment of $88,641.22.
TIP  The 6-percent interest rate is divided by 12 because the loan’s interest is 
compounded monthly.
You can also use the names of any ranges you defined to supply values for a formula. 
For example, if the named range NortheastLastDay refers to cells C4:I4, you can cal­
culate the average of cells C4:I4 with the formula =AVERAGE(NortheastLastDay). With 
Excel, you can add functions, named ranges, and table references to your formulas 
more efficiently by using the Formula AutoComplete capability. Just as AutoComplete 
offers to fill in a cell’s text value when Excel recognizes that the value you’re typing 
matches a previous entry, Formula AutoComplete offers to help you fill in a function, 
named range, or table reference while you create a formula.
As an example, consider a worksheet that contains a two-column Excel table named 
Exceptions. The first column is labeled Route; the second is labeled Count.
79
Create formulas to calculate values

Excel tables track data in a structured format
You refer to a table by typing the table name, followed by the column or row name in 
brackets. For example, the table reference Exceptions[Count] would refer to the Count 
column in the Exceptions table.
To create a formula that finds the total number of exceptions by using the SUM func­
tion, you begin by typing =SU. When you enter the letter S, Formula AutoComplete 
lists functions that begin with the letter S; when you enter the letter U, Excel narrows 
the list down to the functions that start with the letters SU.
Excel displays Formula AutoComplete suggestions to help with formula creation
80
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

To add the SUM function (followed by an opening parenthesis) to the formula, click 
SUM and then press Tab. To begin adding the table reference, enter the letter E. 
Excel displays a list of available functions, tables, and named ranges that start with 
the letter E. Click Exceptions, and press Tab to add the table reference to the formula. 
Then, because you want to summarize the values in the table’s Count column, enter an 
opening bracket, and in the list of available table items, click Count. To finish creating 
the formula, enter a closing bracket followed by a closing parenthesis to create the 
formula =SUM(Exceptions[Count]).
If you want to include a series of contiguous cells in a formula, but you haven’t defined 
the cells as a named range, you can click the first cell in the range and drag to the last 
cell. If the cells aren’t contiguous, hold down the Ctrl key and select all of the cells to 
be included. In both cases, when you release the mouse button, the references of the 
cells you selected appear in the formula.
A SUM formula that adds individual cells instead of a continuous range
In addition to using the Ctrl key to add cells to a selection, you can expand a selection 
by using a wide range of keyboard shortcuts. 
81

The following table summarizes many of those shortcuts.

After you create a formula, you can copy it and paste it into another cell. When you 
do, Excel tries to change the formula so that it works in the new cells. For instance, 
suppose you have a worksheet where cell D8 contains the formula =SUM(C2:C6). 
Clicking cell D8, copying the cell’s contents, and then pasting the result into cell D16 
writes =SUM(C10:C14) into cell D16. Excel has reinterpreted the formula so that it 
fits the surrounding cells! Excel knows it can reinterpret the cells used in the formula 
because the formula uses a relative reference, or a reference that can change if the 
formula is copied to another cell. Relative references are written with just the cell row 
and column (for example, C14).
82
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

3
Relative references are useful when you summarize rows of data and want to use the 
same formula for each row. As an example, suppose you have a worksheet with two 
columns of data, labeled Sale Price and Rate, and you want to calculate your sales 
representative’s commission by multiplying the two values in a row. To calculate the 
commission for the first sale, you would enter the formula =A2*B2 in cell C2.
Use formulas to calculate values such as commissions
Selecting cell C2 and dragging the fill handle until it covers cells C2:C7 copies the 
formula from cell C2 into each of the other cells. Because you created the formula 
by using relative references, Excel updates each cell’s formula to reflect its position 
relative to the starting cell (in this case, cell C2.) The formula in cell C7, for example, 
is =A7*B7.
83
Create formulas to calculate values

Copying formulas to other cells summarizes additional data
You can use a similar technique when you add a formula to an Excel table column. 
If the sale price and rate data were in an Excel table and you created the formula 
=A2*B2 in cell C2, Excel would apply the formula to every other cell in the column. 
Because you used relative references in the formula, the formulas would change to 
reflect each cell’s distance from the original cell.
84
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

3
Adding a formula to an Excel table cell creates a calculated column
If you want a cell reference to remain constant when you copy the formula that is 
using it to another cell, you can use an absolute reference. To write a cell reference 
as an absolute reference, you enter $ before the row letter and the column number. 
For example, if you want the formula in cell D16 to show the sum of values in cells C10 
through C14 regardless of the cell into which it is pasted, you can write the formula as 
=SUM($C$10:$C$14).
TIP  Another way to ensure that your cell references don’t change when you copy a 
formula to another cell is to click the cell that contains the formula, copy the formula’s 
text in the formula bar, press the Esc key to exit cut-and-copy mode, click the cell where you 
want to paste the formula, and press Ctrl+V. Excel doesn’t change the cell references when you 
copy your formula to another cell in this manner.
One quick way to change a cell reference from relative to absolute is to select the 
cell reference in the formula bar and then press F4. Pressing F4 cycles a cell reference 
through the four possible types of references:
■
■
Relative columns and rows (for example, C4)
■
■
Absolute columns and rows (for example, $C$4)
■
■
Relative columns and absolute rows (for example, C$4)
■
■
Absolute columns and relative rows (for example, $C4)

Operators and precedence
When you create an Excel formula, you use the built-in functions and ­arithmetic 
operators that define operations such as addition and multiplication. In Excel, 
­mathematical operators are evaluated in the order listed in the following table.
Operator
Description
-
Negation
%
Percentage
^
Exponentiation
* and /
Multiplication and division
+ and –
Addition and subtraction
&
Concatenation (adding two strings together)
If two operators at the same level, such as + and –, occur in the same equation, 
Excel evaluates them in left-to-right order. For example, the operations in the 
formula = 4 + 8 * 3 – 6 would be evaluated in this order:
1.	 8 * 3, with a result of 24
2.	 4 + 24, with a result of 28
3.	 28 – 6, with a final result of 22
88

To move a formula without changing its cell references
1.	 Click the cell that contains the formula you want to copy.
2.	 Point to the edge of the cell you selected.
3.	 Drag the outline to the cell where you want to move the formula.
To copy a formula while changing its cell references
1.	 Click the cell that contains the formula you want to copy.
2.	 Press Ctrl+C.
3.	 Click the cell where you want to paste the formula.
4.	 Press Ctrl+V.
You can control the order in which Excel evaluates operations by using paren-
theses. Excel always evaluates operations in parentheses first. For example, if the 
previous equation were rewritten as = (4 + 8) * 3 – 6, the operations would be 
evaluated in this order:
1.	 (4 + 8), with a result of 12
2.	 12 * 3, with a result of 36
3.	 36 – 6, with a final result of 30
If you have multiple levels of parentheses, Excel evaluates the expressions within 
the innermost set of parentheses first and works its way out. As with operations 
on the same level, such as + and –, expressions in the same parenthetical level 
are evaluated in left-to-right order.
For example, the formula = 4 + (3 + 8 * (2 + 5)) – 7 would be evaluated in this 
order:
1.	 (2 + 5), with a result of 7
2.	 7 * 8, with a result of 56
3.	 56 + 3, with a result of 59
4.	 4 + 59, with a result of 63
5.	 63 – 7, with a final result of 56

3.	 Enter a $ in front of a row or column reference you want to make absolute.
Or
Press F4 to advance through the four possible combinations of relative and 
absolute row and column references.
Summarize data that meets specific 
conditions
Another use for formulas is to display messages when certain conditions are met. 
This kind of formula is called a conditional formula; one way to create a conditional 
formula in Excel is to use the IF function. Clicking the Insert Function button next to 
the formula bar and then choosing the IF function displays the Function Arguments 
dialog box with the fields required to create an IF formula.
The Function Arguments dialog box for an IF formula
When you work with an IF function, the Function Arguments dialog box has three 
boxes: Logical_test, Value_if_true, and Value_if_false. The Logical_test box holds the 
condition you want to check. 
90
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

3
Now you need to have Excel display messages that indicate whether the condition is 
met or not. To have Excel print a message from an IF function, you enclose the mes­
sage in quotes in the Value_if_true or Value_if_false box. In this case, you would type 
“High-volume shipper—evaluate for rate decrease” in the Value_if_true box and “Does 
not qualify at this time” in the Value_if_false box.
Excel also includes several other conditional functions you can use to summarize your 
data, as shown in the following table.
Function
Description
AVERAGEIF
Finds the average of values within a cell range that meet a 
specified criterion
AVERAGEIFS
Finds the average of values within a cell range that meet multiple 
criteria
COUNT
Counts the number of cells in a range that contain a numerical 
value
COUNTA
Counts the number of cells in a range that are not empty
COUNTBLANK
Counts the number of cells in a range that are empty
COUNTIF
Counts the number of cells in a range that meet a specified 
criterion
COUNTIFS
Counts the number of cells in a range that meet multiple criteria
IFERROR
Displays one value if a formula results in an error and another if it 
doesn’t
SUMIF
Finds the sum of values in a range that meet a single criterion
SUMIFS
Finds the sum of values in a range that meet multiple criteria
You can use the IFERROR function to display a custom error message, instead of 
relying on the default Excel error messages to explain what happened. For example, 
you could use an IFERROR formula when looking up a value by using the VLOOKUP 
function. An example of creating this type of formula would be to look up a cus­
tomer’s name, found in the second column of a table named Customers, based on 
the customer identification number entered into cell G8. That formula might look 
like this: =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(G8,Customers,2,false),”Customer not found”). If the 
function finds a match for the CustomerID in cell G8, it displays the customer’s 
name; if it doesn’t find a match, it displays the text Customer not found.
91
Summarize data that meets specific conditions

TIP  The last two arguments in the VLOOKUP function tell the formula to look in the 
Customers table’s second column and to require an exact match. For more information 
about the VLOOKUP function, see “Look up information in a worksheet” in Chapter 6, “Reorder 
and summarize data.”
Just as the COUNTIF function counts the number of cells that meet a criterion and the 
SUMIF function finds the total of values in cells that meet a criterion, the AVERAGEIF 
function finds the average of values in cells that meet a criterion. To create a formula 
that uses the AVERAGEIF function, you define the range to be examined for the cri­
terion, the criterion, and, if required, the range from which to draw the values. As an 
example, consider a worksheet that lists each customer’s ID number, name, state, and 
total monthly shipping bill.
A list of data that contains customer information
If you want to find the average order of customers from the state of Washington 
(abbreviated in the worksheet as WA), you can create the formula =AVERAGEIF(C3:C6, 
“WA”, D3:D6).
The AVERAGEIFS, SUMIFS, and COUNTIFS functions extend the capabilities of the 
AVERAGEIF, SUMIF, and COUNTIF functions to allow for multiple criteria. If you want 
to find the sum of all orders of at least $100,000 placed by companies in Washington, 
you can create the formula =SUMIFS(D3:D6, C3:C6, “=WA”, D3:D6, “>=100000”).
The AVERAGEIFS and SUMIFS functions start with a data range that contains values 
that the formula summarizes; you then list the data ranges and the criteria to apply to 
that range. In generic terms, the syntax runs =AVERAGEIFS(data_range, criteria_range1, 
criteria1[,criteria_range2, criteria2...]). The part of the syntax in brackets (which aren’t 
used when you create the formula) is optional, so an AVERAGEIFS or SUMIFS formula 
that contains a single criterion will work. The COUNTIFS function, which doesn’t

­perform any calculations, doesn’t need a data range—you just provide the criteria 
ranges and criteria. For example, you could find the number of customers from Wash­
ington who were billed at least $100,000 by using the formula =COUNTIFS(D3:D6, 
“=WA”, E3:E6, “>=100000”).
To summarize data by using the IF function

Summarize data that meets specific conditions

Set iterative calculation options and enable 
or disable automatic calculation
Excel formulas use values in other cells to calculate their results. If you create a 
formula that refers to the cell that contains the formula, you have created a circular 
reference. Under most circumstances, Excel treats circular references as a mistake for 
two reasons. First, the vast majority of Excel formulas don’t refer to their own cell, so 
a circular reference is unusual enough to be identified as an error. The second, more 
serious consideration is that a formula with a circular reference can slow down your 
workbook. Because Excel repeats, or iterates, the calculation, you need to set limits on 
how many times the app repeats the operation.
You can control your workbook’s calculation options by using the controls on the 
Formulas page of the Excel Options dialog box.

Use array formulas
Most Excel formulas calculate values to be displayed in a single cell. For example, you 
could add the formulas =B1*B4, =B1*B5, and =B1*B6 to consecutive worksheet cells to 
calculate shipping insurance costs based on the value of a package’s contents.
A worksheet with data to be summarized by an array formula
Rather than add the same formula to multiple cells one cell at a time, you can add 
a formula to every cell in the target range at the same time by creating an array 
formula. To create an array formula, you enter the formula’s arguments and press 
Ctrl+Shift+Enter to identify the formula as an array formula. To calculate package 
insurance rates for values in the cell range B4:B6 and the rate in cell B1, you would 
98

select a range of cells with the same shape as the value range and enter the formula 
=B1*B4:B6. In this case, the values are in a three-cell column, so you must select a 
range of the same shape, such as C4:C6.
A worksheet with an array formula ready to be entered
IMPORTANT  If you enter the array formula into a range of the wrong shape, Excel 
displays duplicate results, incomplete results, or error messages, depending on how the 
target range differs from the value range.
When you press Ctrl+Shift+Enter, Excel creates an array formula in the selected cells. 
The formula appears within a pair of braces to indicate that it is an array formula. 
IMPORTANT  You can’t add braces to a formula to make it an array formula—you must 
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to create it.
In addition to creating an array formula that combines a single cell’s value with an 
array, you can create array formulas that use two separate arrays. For example, a com­
pany might establish a goal to reduce sorting time in each of four distribution centers. 
A worksheet with data for an array formula that multiplies two arrays
99
Use array formulas

This worksheet stores the previous sorting times in minutes in cells B2:B5, and the 
percentage targets in cells C2:C5. The array formula to calculate the targets for each 
of the four centers is =B2:B5*C2:C5 which, when entered into cells D2:D5 by pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+Enter, would appear as {= B2:B5*C2:C5}.
To edit an array formula, you must select every cell that contains the array formula, 
click the formula bar to activate it, edit the formula in the formula bar, and then press 
Ctrl+Shift+Enter to re-enter the formula as an array formula.
TIP  Many operations that used to require an array formula can now be calculated by 
using functions such as SUMIFS and COUNTIFS.
To create an array formula
1.	 Select the cells into which you want to enter the array formula.
2.	 Enter your array formula.
3.	 Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. 
To edit an array formula
1.	 Select the cells that contain the array formula.
2.	 Edit your array formula.
3.	 Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. 
Find and correct errors in calculations
Including calculations in a worksheet gives you valuable answers to questions about 
your data. As is always true, however, it is possible for errors to creep into your formu­
las. With Excel, you can find the source of errors in your formulas by identifying the 
cells used in a specific calculation and describing any errors that have occurred. The 
process of examining a worksheet for errors is referred to as auditing.
Excel identifies errors in several ways. The first way is to display an error code in the 
cell holding the formula generating the error.
100
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

3
A worksheet with an error code displayed
When a cell with an erroneous formula is the active cell, an Error button is displayed 
next to it. If you point to the Error button Excel displays an arrow on the button’s right 
edge. Clicking the arrow displays a menu with options that provide information about 
the error and offer to help you fix it.
The following table lists the most common error codes and what they mean.
Error code
Description
#####
The column isn’t wide enough to display the value.
#VALUE!
The formula has the wrong type of argument (such as text in a cell 
where a numerical value is required).
#NAME?
The formula contains text that Excel doesn’t recognize (such as an 
unknown named range).
#REF!
The formula refers to a cell that doesn’t exist (which can happen 
whenever cells are deleted).
#DIV/0!
The formula attempts to divide by zero.
Another technique you can use to find the source of formula errors is to ensure that 
the appropriate cells are providing values for the formula. You can identify the source 
of an error by having Excel trace a cell’s precedents, which are the cells with values 
used in the active cell’s formula. You can also audit your worksheet by identifying cells 
101
Find and correct errors in calculations

with formulas that use a value from a particular cell. Cells that use another cell’s value 
in their calculations are known as dependents, meaning that they depend on the 
value in the other cell to derive their own value. 
A worksheet with a cell’s dependents indicated by tracer arrows
If the cells identified by the tracer arrows aren’t the correct cells, you can hide the 
arrows and correct the formula. 
If you prefer to have the elements of a formula error presented as text in a dialog box, 
you can use the Error Checking dialog box to move through the formula one step at a 
time, to choose to ignore the error, or to move to the next or the previous error. 
Identify and manage errors by using the Error Checking dialog box
102
Chapter 3: Perform calculations on data

3
TIP  You can have the Error Checking tool ignore formulas that don’t use every cell in a 
region (such as a row or column) by modifying this option in the Excel Options dialog 
box. To do so, on the Formulas tab of the dialog box, if you clear the Formulas Which Omit Cells 
In A Region check box, you can create formulas that don’t add up every value in a row or 
column (or rectangle) without Excel marking them as an error.
For times when you just want to display the results of each step of a formula and don’t 
need the full power of the Error Checking tool, you can use the Evaluate Formula dialog 
box to move through each element of the formula. The Evaluate Formula dialog box is 
much more useful for examining formulas that don’t produce an error but aren’t gener­
ating the result you expect.
Step through formulas by using the Evaluate Formula dialog box
Finally, you can monitor the value in a cell regardless of where in your workbook you 
are by opening a Watch Window that displays the value in the cell. For example, if one 
of your formulas uses values from cells in other worksheets or even other workbooks, 
you can set a watch on the cell that contains the formula and then change the values 
in the other cells. 
As soon as you enter the new value, the Watch Window displays the new result of the 
formula. When you’re done watching the formula, you can delete the watch and hide 
the Watch Window.

Entering data into a workbook efficiently saves you time, 
but you must also ensure that your data is easy to read. 
Microsoft Excel 2016 gives you a wide variety of ways 
to make your data easier to understand; for example, 
you can change the font, character size, or color used to 
present a cell’s contents. Changing how data appears on 
a worksheet helps set the contents of a cell apart from 
the contents of surrounding cells. To save time, you can 
define a number of custom formats and then apply them 
quickly to the cells you want to emphasize.
You might also want to specially format a cell’s contents 
to reflect the value in that cell. For example, you could 
create a worksheet that displays the percentage of 
improperly delivered packages from each regional dis­
tribution center. If that percentage exceeds a threshold, 
Excel could display a red traffic light icon, indicating that 
the center’s performance is out of tolerance and requires 
attention.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
changing the appearance of data, applying existing for­
mats to data, making numbers easier to read, changing 
data’s appearance based on its value, and adding images 
to worksheets.
111

Format cells
Excel worksheets can hold and process lots of data, but when you manage numerous 
worksheets, it can be hard to remember from a worksheet’s title exactly what data is 
kept in that worksheet. Data labels give you and your colleagues information about 
data in a worksheet, but it’s important to format the labels so that they stand out 
visually. To make your data labels or any other data stand out, you can change the 
format of the cells that hold your data.
Use formatting to set labels apart from worksheet data
TIP  Deleting a cell’s contents doesn’t delete the cell’s formatting. To delete a selected 
cell’s formatting, on the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the Clear button (which 
looks like an eraser), and then click Clear Formats. Clicking Clear All from the same list will 
remove the cell’s contents and formatting.
112

Many of the formatting-related buttons on the ribbon have arrows at their right 
edges. Clicking the arrow displays a list of options for that button, such as the fonts 
available on your system or the colors you can assign to a cell.
TIP  Clicking the body of the Border, Fill Color, or Font Color button applies the most 
recently applied formatting to the currently selected cells.
Change font color to help labels and values stand out
You can also make a cell stand apart from its neighbors by adding a border around 
the cell or changing the color or shading of the cell’s interior.
113
Format cells

Add borders to set cells apart from their neighbors
TIP  You can display the most commonly used formatting controls by right-clicking a 
selected range. When you do, a mini toolbar containing a subset of the Home tab 
formatting tools appears above the shortcut menu.
If you want to change the attributes of every cell in a row or column, you can click 
the header of the row or column you want to modify and then select the format 
you want.
One task you can’t perform by using the tools on the ribbon is to change the default 
font for a workbook, which is used in the formula bar. The default font when you 
install Excel is Calibri, a simple font that is easy to read on a computer screen and on 
the printed page. If you’d prefer to change the default font, you can do so, but only 
from the Excel Options dialog box, not from the ribbon.

Define styles
As you work with Excel, you will probably develop preferred formats for data labels, 
titles, and other worksheet elements. Instead of adding a format’s characteristics one 
element at a time to the target cells, you can format the cell in one action by using a 
cell style. Excel comes with many built-in styles, which you can apply by using the Cell 
118

Style gallery. You can also create your own styles by using the Style dialog box and 
apply them as needed. If you want to preview how the contents of your cell (or cells) 
will look when you apply the style, point to the style to get a live preview.
TIP  Depending on your screen’s resolution, cell style options might be accessed via an 
in-ribbon gallery instead of a Cell Styles button. If you see an in-ribbon gallery, click 
the More button that appears in the lower-right corner of the gallery (it looks like a small, 
downward-pointing black triangle) to display the full set of cell styles available.
It’s likely that any cell styles you create will be useful for more than one workbook. If 
you want to include cell styles from another workbook into your current workbook, 
you can merge the two workbooks’ style collections.

Apply workbook themes and 
Excel table styles
Microsoft Office 2016 includes powerful design tools that you can use to create 
attractive, professional documents quickly. The Excel product team implemented 
these capabilities by defining workbook themes and Excel table styles. A theme is a 
way to specify the fonts, colors, and graphic effects that appear in a workbook. Excel 
comes with many themes.

When you start to format a workbook element, Excel displays a palette of colors with 
two sections: standard colors, which remain constant regardless of the workbook’s 
theme, and colors that are available within the active theme. If you format workbook 
elements by using colors specific to a theme, applying a different theme changes the 
colors of those elements.
Select theme-specific or standard colors
You can change a theme’s colors, fonts, and graphic effects. If you like the combina­
tion you create, you can save your changes as a new theme that will appear at the top 
of the themes gallery.
TIP  When you save a theme, you save it as an Office theme file. You can also apply the 
theme to other Office 2016 documents.
Just as you can define and apply themes to entire workbooks, you can apply and 
define Excel table styles. After you give your style a descriptive name, you can set the 
appearance for each Excel table element, decide whether to make your new style the 
default for the current document, and save your work.

Make numbers easier to read
Changing the format of the cells in your worksheet can make your data much easier 
to read, both by setting data labels apart from the actual data and by adding borders 
to define the boundaries between labels and data even more clearly. Of course, using 
formatting options to change the font and appearance of a cell’s contents doesn’t 
help with idiosyncratic data types such as dates, phone numbers, or currency values.
As an example, consider US phone numbers. These numbers are 10 digits long and 
have a 3-digit area code, a 3-digit exchange, and a 4-digit line number written in the 
form (###) ###-####. Although it’s certainly possible to enter a phone number with 
the expected formatting in a cell, it’s much simpler to enter a sequence of 10 digits 
and have Excel change the data’s appearance.
Select built-in number formats from the Special category
You can watch this format in operation if you compare the contents of the active cell 
and the contents of the formula box for a cell with the Phone Number formatting.
127
Make numbers easier to read

Change the appearance of data without affecting the underlying data
IMPORTANT  If you enter a 9-digit number in a field that expects a phone number, you 
won’t get an error message; instead, you’ll get a 2-digit area code. For example, the 
number 425550012 would be displayed as (42) 555-0012. An 11-digit number would be 
displayed with a 4-digit area code. If the phone number doesn’t look right, you probably left 
out a digit or included an extra one, so you should make sure your entry is correct.
Just as you can instruct Excel to expect a phone number in a cell, you can also have it 
expect a date or a currency amount. You can pick from a wide variety of date, cur­
rency, and other formats to best reflect your worksheet’s contents, your company 
standards, and how you and your colleagues expect the data to appear.
TIP  In the Excel user interface you can make the most common format changes by 
displaying the Home tab and then, in the Number group, either clicking a button 
representing a built-in format or selecting a format from the Number Format list.
128
Chapter 4: Change workbook appearance

4
You can also create a custom numeric format to add a word or phrase to a number 
in a cell. For example, you can add the phrase per month to a cell with a formula that 
calculates average monthly sales for a year, to ensure that you and your colleagues 
will recognize the figure as a monthly average. If one of the built-in formats is close to 
the custom format you’d like to create, you can base your custom format on the one 
already included in Excel.
IMPORTANT  You need to enclose any text to be displayed as part of the format in 
quotation marks so that Excel recognizes the text as a string to be displayed in the cell.
To apply a special number format
1.	 Select the cells to which you want to apply the format.
2.	 On the Home tab, in the Number group, click the Number Format arrow, and 
then click More Number Formats.
3.	 In the Format Cells dialog box, in the Category list, click Special.
4.	 In the Type list, click the format you want to apply.
5.	 Click OK.
To create a custom number format
1.	 On the Number Format menu, click More Number Formats.
2.	 In the Format Cells dialog box, in the Category list, click Custom.
3.	 Click the format you want to use as the base for your new format.
4.	 Edit the format in the Type box.

Change the appearance of data 
based on its value
Recording information such as package volumes, vehicle miles, and other business 
data in a worksheet enables you to make important decisions about your operations. 
And as you saw earlier in this chapter, you can change the appearance of data labels 
and the worksheet itself to make interpreting your data easier.
Another way you can make your data easier to interpret is to have Excel change the 
appearance of your data based on its value. The formats that make this possible are 
called conditional formats, because the data must meet certain conditions, defined 
130
Chapter 4: Change workbook appearance

in conditional formatting rules, to have a format applied to it. In Excel, you can define 
conditional formats that change how the app displays data in cells that contain values 
above or below the average values of the related cells, that contain values near the 
top or bottom of the value range, or that contain values duplicated elsewhere in the 
selected range.
When you select which kind of condition to create, Excel displays a dialog box that 
contains fields and controls you can use to define your rule. If your cells already have 
conditional formats applied to them, you can display those formats.
Manage conditional formats by using the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager
You can control your conditional formats in the following ways:
■
■
Create a new rule.
■
■
Change a rule.
■
■
Remove a rule.
■
■
Move a rule up or down in the order.
■
■
Control whether Excel continues evaluating conditional formats after it finds 
a rule to apply.
■
■
Save any rule changes and stop editing rules.
■
■
Save any rule changes and continue editing.
■
■
Discard any unsaved changes.
131
Change the appearance of data based on its value 

Clicking the New Rule button in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager opens 
the New Formatting Rule dialog box. The commands in the New Formatting Rule 
dialog box duplicate the options displayed when you click the Conditional Format­
ting button in the Styles group on the Home tab. You can use those controls to define 
your new rule and the format to be displayed if the rule is true.
Create rules by using the New Formatting Rule dialog box
IMPORTANT  Excel doesn’t check to make sure that your conditions are logically 
consistent, so you need to be sure that you plan and enter your conditions correctly.
You can also create three other types of conditional formats in Excel: data bars, color 
scales, and icon sets. Data bars summarize the relative magnitude of values in a cell 
range by extending a band of color across the cell.
132
Chapter 4: Change workbook appearance

4
Apply data bars to view how values compare to one another
You can create two types of data bars in Excel 2016: solid fill and gradient fill. When 
data bars were introduced in Excel 2007, they filled cells with a color band that 
decreased in intensity as it moved across the cell. This gradient fill pattern made it a 
bit difficult to determine the relative length of two data bars because the end points 
weren’t as distinct as they would have been if the bars were a solid color. In Excel 2016 
you can choose between a solid fill pattern, which makes the right edge of the bars 
easier to discern, and a gradient fill, which you can use if you share your workbook 
with colleagues who use Excel 2007.
Excel 2016 also draws data bars differently than in Excel 2007. Excel 2007 drew a very 
short data bar for the lowest value in a range and a very long data bar for the highest 
value. The problem was that similar values could be represented by data bars of very 
different lengths if there wasn’t much variance among the values in the condition­
ally formatted range. In Excel 2016, data bars compare values based on their distance 
from zero, so similar values are summarized by using data bars of similar lengths.
TIP  Excel 2016 data bars summarize negative values by using bars that extend to the 
left of a baseline that the app draws in a cell. 
133
Change the appearance of data based on its value 

Color scales compare the relative magnitude of values in a cell range by applying 
colors from a two-color or three-color set to your cells. The intensity of a cell’s color 
reflects the value’s tendency toward the top or bottom of the values in the range.
Apply a color scale to emphasize the magnitude of values within a cell range
Icon sets are collections of three, four, or five images that Excel displays when certain 
rules are met.
Icon sets show how values compare to a standard
When icon sets were introduced in Excel 2007, you could apply an icon set as a whole, 
but you couldn’t create custom icon sets or choose to have Excel 2007 display no icon 
if the value in a cell met a criterion. In Excel 2016, you can display any icon from any 
set for any criterion or display no icon, plus you can edit your format in other ways so 
it summarizes your data exactly as you want it to.
134
Chapter 4: Change workbook appearance

When you click a color scale or icon set in the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager 
and then click the Edit Rule button, you can control when Excel applies a color or icon 
to your data.
IMPORTANT  Be sure to not include cells that contain summary formulas in your 
conditionally formatted ranges. The values, which could be much higher or lower than 
your regular cell data, could throw off your comparisons.

Add images to worksheets
Establishing a strong corporate identity helps you ensure that your customers 
remember your organization and the products and services you offer. Setting aside 
the obvious need for sound management, two important physical attributes of a 
strong retail business are a well-conceived shop space and an eye-catching, easy-to-
remember logo. After you or your graphic artist creates a logo, you should add the 
logo to all your documents, especially any that might be seen by your customers. Not 
only does the logo mark the documents as coming from your company, it also serves 
as an advertisement, encouraging anyone who sees your worksheets to call or visit 
your company.
One way to add a picture to a worksheet is to locate the picture you want to add from 
your hard disk, insert it, and then make any formatting changes you want. For exam­
ple, you can rotate, reposition, and resize the picture.
Insert images to enhance your data
With Excel 2016, you can remove the background of an image you insert into a 
workbook. When you indicate that you want to remove an image’s background, Excel 
guesses which aspects of the image are in the foreground and eliminates the rest.
138

You can drag the handles on the inner square of the background removal tool to 
change how the tool analyzes the image, and save your results when you’re done.
If you want to generate a repeating image in the background of a worksheet to form 
a tiled pattern or texture behind your worksheet’s data, or perhaps add a single image 
that serves as a watermark, you can do so. 
TIP  To remove a background image from a worksheet, display the Page Layout tab, and 
then in the Page Setup group, click Delete Background.
To add an image stored on your computer to a worksheet
1.	 On the Insert tab of the ribbon, in the Illustrations group, click Pictures.

folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
With Excel 2016, you can manage huge data collec­
tions, but storing more than 1 million rows of data 
doesn’t help you make business decisions unless you 
have the ability to focus on the most important data 
in a ­worksheet. Focusing on the most relevant data in 
a worksheet facilitates decision making. Excel includes 
many powerful and flexible tools with which you can 
limit the data displayed in your worksheet. When your 
worksheet displays the subset of data you need to make 
a decision, you can perform calculations on that data. 
You can discover what percentage of monthly revenue 
was earned in the 10 best days in the month, find your 
total revenue for particular days of the week, or locate 
the slowest business day of the month.
Just as you can limit the data displayed by your work­
sheets, you can also create validation rules that limit 
the data entered into them. When you set rules for 
data entered into cells, you can catch many of the most 
common data entry errors, such as entering values that 
are too small or too large, or attempting to enter a word 
in a cell that requires a number. If you add a validation rule 
after data has been entered, you can circle any invalid 
data so that you know what to correct.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
limiting the data that appears on your screen, manipulat­
ing list data, and creating validation rules that limit data 
entry to appropriate values.
147

Limit data that appears on your screen
Excel worksheets can hold as much data as you need them to, but you might not want 
to work with all the data in a worksheet at the same time. For example, you might 
want to look at the revenue figures for your company during the first third, second 
third, and final third of a month. You can limit the data shown on a worksheet by 
­creating a filter, which is a rule that selects rows to be shown in a worksheet.
IMPORTANT  When you turn on filtering, Excel treats the cells in the active cell’s column 
as a range. To ensure that the filtering works properly, you should always have a label at 
the top of the column you want to filter. If you don’t, Excel treats the first value in the list as the 
label and doesn’t include it in the list of values by which you can filter the data.
When you turn on filtering, a filter arrow appears to the right of each column label in 
the list of data. Clicking the filter arrow displays a menu of filtering options and a list 
of the unique values in the column. Each item has a check box next to it, which you 
can use to create a selection filter. Some of the commands vary depending on the 
type of data in the column. For example, if the column contains a set of dates, you will 
get a list of commands specific to that data type.
TIP  In Excel tables, filter arrows are turned on by default. 
TIP  When a column contains several types of data, the filter command for it is Number 
Filters.
Chapter 5: Manage worksheet data
148

5
Use filters to limit the data that appears in a worksheet
When you click a filtering option, Excel displays a dialog box in which you can define 
the filter’s criteria. As an example, you could create a filter that displays only dates 
after 3/31/2016.
Limit data that appears on your screen
149

Columns with a filter applied display a funnel icon on their filter arrows
If you want to display the highest or lowest values in a data column, you can create a 
Top 10 filter. You can choose whether to show values from the top or bottom of the 
list, define the number of items you want to display, and choose whether that number 
indicates the actual number of items or the percentage of items to be shown when 
the filter is applied. 
TIP  Top 10 filters can be applied only to columns that contain number values. 
Excel 2016 includes a capability called the search filter, which you can use to enter a 
search string that Excel uses to identify which items to display in an Excel table or a 
data list. Enter the character string you want to search for, and Excel limits your data 
to values that contain that string.
Chapter 5: Manage worksheet data
150

5
Applying a search filter limits the items that appear in the selection list
When you create a custom filter, you can define a rule that Excel uses to decide which 
rows to show after the filter is applied. For instance, you can create a rule that deter­
mines that only days with package volumes of less than 100,000 should be shown in 
your worksheet. With those results in front of you, you might be able to determine 
whether the weather or another factor resulted in slower business on those days.
Excel indicates that a column has a filter applied by changing the appearance of the 
column’s filter arrow to include an icon that looks like a funnel. After you finish exam­
ining your data by using a filter, you can clear the filter or turn off filtering entirely and 
hide the filter arrows.

Manipulate worksheet data
Excel includes a wide range of tools you can use to summarize worksheet data. This 
topic describes how to select rows at random by using the RAND and RANDBETWEEN 
functions, how to summarize worksheet data by using the SUBTOTAL and AGGREGATE 
functions, and how to display a list of unique values within a data set.
Manipulate worksheet data
153

Select list rows at random
In addition to filtering the data that is stored in your Excel worksheets, you can 
choose rows at random from a list. Selecting rows randomly is useful for 
choosing which customers will receive a special offer, deciding which days of 
the month to audit, or picking prize winners at an employee party.
To choose rows randomly, you can use the RAND function, which generates 
a random decimal value between 0 and 1, and compare the value it returns 
with a test value included in a formula. If you recalculate the RAND function 
10 times and check each time to find out whether the value is below 0.3, it’s 
very unlikely that you would get exactly three instances where the value is 
below 0.3. Just as flipping a coin can result in the same result 10 times in a row 
by chance, so can the RAND function’s results appear to be off if you only 
recalculate it a few times. However, if you were to recalculate the ­function 
10,000 times, it is extremely likely that the number of values less than 0.3 
would be very close to 30 percent.
TIP  Because the RAND function is a volatile function (that is, it recalculates 
its results every time you update the worksheet), you should copy the cells 
that contain the RAND function in a formula and paste the formulas’ values 
back into their original cells. To do so, select the cells that contain the RAND 
formulas and paste them back into the same cells as values.
The RANDBETWEEN function generates a random whole number within a 
defined range. For example, the formula =RANDBETWEEN(1,100) would gener-
ate a random integer value from 1 through 100, inclusive. The RANDBETWEEN 
function is very useful for creating sample data collections for presentations. 
Before the RANDBETWEEN ­function was introduced, you had to create for-
mulas that added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the results of the RAND 
function, which are always decimal values between 0 and 1, to create data.
To use RAND or RANDBETWEEN to select a row, create an IF formula that 
tests the random values. If you want to check 30 percent of the rows, a for-
mula such as =IF(cell_address<0.3, “TRUE”, “FALSE”) would display TRUE in 
the formula cells for any value of 0.3 or less and FALSE otherwise.

Summarize data in worksheets that have hidden and 
filtered rows
The ability to analyze the data that’s most vital to your current needs is important, 
but there are some limitations to how you can summarize your filtered data by using 
functions such as SUM and AVERAGE. One limitation is that any formulas you create 
that include the SUM and AVERAGE functions don’t change their calculations if some 
of the rows used in the formula are hidden by the filter.
Excel provides two ways to summarize just the visible cells in a filtered data list. The 
first method is to use AutoCalculate. To use AutoCalculate, you select the cells you 
want to summarize. When you do, Excel displays the average of the values in the 
cells, the sum of the values in the cells, and the number of visible cells (the count) in 
the selection. You’ll find the display on the status bar at the lower edge of the Excel 
window.
When you use AutoCalculate, you aren’t limited to finding the sum, average, and 
count of the selected cells. You can add or remove calculations to suit your needs; a 
check mark appears next to a function’s name if that function’s result appears on the 
status bar. 
The status bar displays summary values when you select more than one cell that contains numeric data
AutoCalculate is great for finding a quick total or average for filtered cells, but it doesn’t 
make the result available in the worksheet. Formulas such as =SUM(C3:C26) always 
consider every cell in the range, regardless of whether you hide a cell’s row manually 
or not, so you need to create a formula by using either the SUBTOTAL function or the 
AGGREGATE function to summarize just those values that are visible in your worksheet. 
The SUBTOTAL function lets you choose whether to summarize every value in a range 
Manipulate worksheet data
155

or summarize only those values in rows you haven’t manually hidden. The SUBTOTAL 
function has this syntax: =SUBTOTAL(function_num, ref1, ref2, ...). The function_num 
argument holds the number of the operation you want to use to summarize your data. 
(The operation numbers are summarized in a table later in this section.) The ref1, ref2, 
and further arguments represent up to 29 ranges to include in the calculation.
As an example, assume you have a worksheet where you hid rows 20-26 manually. In 
this case, the formula =SUBTOTAL(9, C3:C26, E3:E26, G3:G26) would find the sum of 
all values in the ranges C3:C26, E3:E26, and G3:G26, regardless of whether that range 
contained any hidden rows. The formula =SUBTOTAL(109, C3:C26, E3:E26, G3:G26) 
would find the sum of all values in cells C3:C19, E3:E19, and G3:G19, ignoring the values 
in the manually hidden rows.
IMPORTANT  Be sure to place your SUBTOTAL formula in a row that is even with or 
above the headers in the range you’re filtering. If you don’t, your filter might hide the 
formula’s result!
The following table lists the summary operations available for the SUBTOTAL formula. 
Excel displays the available summary operations as part of the Formula AutoComplete 
functionality, so you don’t need to remember the operation numbers or look them up 
in the Help system.

As the preceding table shows, the SUBTOTAL function has two sets of operations. 
The first set (operations 1–11) represents operations that include hidden values in 
their summary, and the second set (operations 101–111) represents operations that 
summarize only values visible in the worksheet. Operations 1–11 summarize all cells 
in a range, regardless of whether the range contains any manually hidden rows. By 
contrast, operations 101–111 ignore any values in manually hidden rows. What the 
SUBTOTAL function doesn’t do, however, is change its result to reflect rows hidden by 
using a filter.
IMPORTANT  Excel treats the first cell in the data range as a header cell, so it doesn’t 
consider the cell as it builds the list of unique values. Be sure to include the header cell in 
your data range!
The AGGREGATE function extends the capabilities of the SUBTOTAL function. With 
it, you can select from a broader range of functions and use another argument to 
determine which, if any, values to ignore in the calculation. AGGREGATE has two 
possible syntaxes, depending on the summary operation you select. The first syntax 
is =AGGREGATE(function_num, options, ref1...), which is similar to the syntax of the 
SUBTOTAL function. The other possible syntax, =AGGREGATE(function_num, options, 
array, [k]), is used to create AGGREGATE functions that use the LARGE, SMALL, 
­PERCENTILE.INC, QUARTILE.INC, PERCENTILE.EXC, and QUARTILE.EXC operations.
The following table summarizes the summary operations available for use in the 
AGGREGATE function.

Find unique values within a data set
Summarizing numerical values can provide valuable information that helps you run 
your business. It can also be helpful to know how many different values appear within 
a column. For example, you might want to display all of the countries and regions 
in which Consolidated Messenger has customers. If you want to display a list of the 
unique values in a column, you can do so by creating an advanced filter.

Define valid sets of values for ranges of cells
Part of creating efficient and easy-to-use worksheets is to do what you can to ensure 
that the data entered into your worksheets is as accurate as possible. Although it isn’t 
possible to catch every typographical or transcription error, you can set up a valida­
tion rule to make sure that the data entered into a cell meets certain standards. For 
example, you can specify the type of data you want, the range of acceptable values, 
and whether blank values are allowed. Setting accurate validation rules can help you 
and your colleagues avoid entering a customer’s name in the cell designated to hold 
the phone number or setting a credit limit above a certain level.
Create data validation rules to ensure that appropriate data is entered into worksheet cells
You can select the cells where you want to add a validation rule, even if those cells 
already contain data. Excel doesn’t tell you whether any of those cells contain data 
that violates your rule at the moment you create the rule, but you can find out by 
having Excel circle any worksheet cells that contain data that violates the cell’s valida­
tion rule. When you’re done, you can have Excel clear the validation circles or have 
Excel turn off data validation for those cells entirely.
Define valid sets of values for ranges of cells
163

Validation circles indicate data previously entered into a worksheet that violates data validation rules
To add a validation rule to a cell
1.	 On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation.
2.	 In the Data Validation dialog box, on the Settings tab, click the Allow arrow, 
and then click the type of values to allow.
3.	 Use the controls to define the rule.
4.	 Select the Ignore blank check box to allow blank values.
Or
Clear the Ignore blank check box to require a value be entered.
5.	 On the Input Message tab, enter an input message for the cell.
6.	 On the Error Alert tab, create an error alert message for values that violate 
the rule.
7.	 Click OK.
To edit a validation rule
1.	 Select one or more cells that contain the validation rule.
2.	 Click Data Validation.
3.	 On the Settings tab, select the Apply these changes to all other cells with the 
same settings check box to affect other cells with the same rule.

One of the most important uses of business information 
is to record when something happens. Whether you ship 
a package to a client or pay a supplier, tracking when you 
took those actions, and in what order, helps you analyze 
your performance. Sorting your information based on the 
values in one or more columns helps you discover useful 
trends, such as whether your sales are generally increasing 
or decreasing, whether you do more business on specific 
days of the week, or whether you sell products to lots of 
customers from certain regions of the world.
Microsoft Excel has capabilities you might expect to 
find only in a database program—the ability to organ­
ize your data into levels of detail you can show or hide, 
and formulas that let you look up values in a list of data. 
Organizing your data by detail level lets you focus on 
the values you need to make a decision, and looking 
up values in a worksheet helps you find specific data. If 
a customer calls to ask about an order, you can use the 
order number or customer number to discover the infor­
mation that customer needs.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
sorting your data by using one or more criteria, calculat­
ing subtotals, organizing your data into levels, and look­
ing up information in a worksheet.
169

Sort worksheet data
Although Excel makes it easy to enter your business data and to manage it after 
you’ve saved it in a worksheet, unsorted data will rarely answer every question you 
want to ask it. For example, you might want to discover which of your services gen­
erates the most profits, or which service costs the most for you to provide. You can 
discover that information by sorting your data.
When you sort data in a worksheet, you rearrange the worksheet rows based on the 
contents of cells in a particular column or set of columns. For instance, you can sort a 
worksheet to find your highest-revenue services.
You can sort a group of rows in a worksheet in a number of ways, but the first step 
is to identify the column that will provide the values by which the rows should be 
sorted. In the revenue example, you could find the highest revenue totals by sorting 
on the cells in the Revenue column. You can do this by using the commands available 
from the Sort & Filter button on the Home tab of the ribbon.
TIP  The exact set of values that appears in the Sort & Filter list changes to reflect the 
data in your column. If your column contains numerical values, you’ll get the options 
Sort Largest To Smallest, Sort Smallest To Largest, and Custom List. If your column contains text 
values, the options will be Sort A To Z (ascending order), Sort Z To A (descending order), and 
Custom List. And if your column contains dates, you’ll get Sort Newest To Oldest, Sort Oldest To 
Newest, and Custom List.
170
Chapter 6: Reorder and summarize data

Revenue sorted in descending order
The Sort Smallest To Largest and Sort Largest To Smallest options let you sort rows in 
a worksheet quickly, but you can use them only to sort the worksheet based on the 
contents of one column, even though you might want to sort by two columns. For 
example, you might want to order the worksheet rows by service category and then 
by total so that you can tell which service categories are used most frequently. 
171
Sort worksheet data

Sort a list of data by more than one column
You can sort rows in a worksheet by the contents of more than one column by using 
the Sort dialog box, in which you can pick any number of columns to use as sort 
criteria and choose whether to sort the rows in ascending or descending order. If you 
want to create two similar rules, perhaps changing just the field to which the rules 
are applied, you can create a rule for one field, copy it within the Sort dialog box, and 
change the field name.
If your data cells have fill colors applied to them, perhaps representing cells with 
values you want your colleagues to notice, you can sort your list of data by using 
those colors. In addition, you can create more detailed sorting rules, change the order

Sort data by using custom lists 
The default setting for Excel is to sort numbers according to their values and to sort 
words in alphabetical order, but that pattern doesn’t work for some sets of values. 
One example in which sorting a list of values in alphabetical order would yield incor­
rect results is the months of the year. In an “alphabetical” calendar, April is the first 
month and September is the last! Fortunately, Excel recognizes a number of special 
lists, such as days of the week and months of the year. You can have Excel sort the 
contents of a worksheet based on values in a known list; if needed, you can create 
your own list of values. For example, the default lists of weekdays in Excel start with 
Sunday. If you keep your business records based on a Monday–Sunday week, you can 
create a new list with Monday as the first day and Sunday as the last.
176
Chapter 6: Reorder and summarize data

You can create a new custom list by using controls that are reached through the Excel 
Options dialog box, which gives you the choice of entering the values yourself or 
importing them from a cell range in your workbook.
Manage your lists by using the Custom Lists dialog box
TIP  Another benefit of creating a custom list is that dragging the fill handle of a list cell 
that contains a value causes Excel to extend the series for you. For example, if you create 
the list Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and then enter Summer in a cell and drag the cell’s fill 
handle, Excel extends the series as Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, and so on.
To define a custom list by entering its values
1.	 On the File tab, click Options.
2.	 In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Advanced category.
3.	 Scroll down to the General area, and then click the Edit Custom Lists button.

Organize data into levels
After you have sorted the rows in an Excel worksheet or entered the data so that it 
doesn’t need to be sorted, you can have Excel calculate subtotals (totals for a portion 
of the data). In a worksheet with sales data for three different product categories, for 
example, you can sort the products by category, select all the cells that contain data, 
and then open the Subtotal dialog box. 
Apply subtotals to data by using the Subtotal dialog box
In the Subtotal dialog box, you can choose the column on which to base your sub­
totals (such as every change of value in the Week column), the summary calculation 
you want to perform, and the column or columns with values to be summarized. After 
you define your subtotals, they appear in your worksheet.
179
Organize data into levels

A list of data with Subtotal outlining applied
When you add subtotals to a worksheet, Excel also defines groups based on the rows 
used to calculate a subtotal. The groupings form an outline of your worksheet based 
on the criteria you used to create the subtotals. For example, all the rows representing 
months in the year 2014 could be in one group, rows representing months in 2015 in 
another, and so on. The outline area at the left of your worksheet holds controls you 
can use to hide or display groups of rows in your worksheet.

A list of data with details for the year 2014 hidden
When you hide a group of rows, the button displayed next to the group changes to 
a Show Detail button (the button with the plus sign). Clicking a group’s Show Detail 
button restores the rows in the group to the worksheet.
The level buttons are the other buttons in the outline area of a worksheet with sub­
totals. Each button represents a level of organization in a worksheet; clicking a level 
button hides all levels of detail below that of the button you clicked. The following 
table describes the data contained at each level of a worksheet with three levels of 
organization.
Level

1
Grand total
2
Subtotals for each group

Organize data into levels

A list of data with details hidden at level 2
If you want, you can add levels of detail to the outline that Excel creates. For example, 
you might want to be able to hide revenues from January and February, which you 
know are traditionally strong months. You can also delete any groupings you no 
longer need, or remove subtotals and outlining entirely.
TIP  If you want to remove all subtotals from a worksheet, open the Subtotal dialog box, 
and click the Remove All button.
To organize data into levels
1.	 Click a cell in the group of data you want to organize.
2.	 On the Data tab of the ribbon, in the Outline group, click the Subtotal button.
3.	 In the Subtotal dialog box, in the At each change in list, select the field that 
controls when subtotals appear.
4.	 In the Use function list, select the summary function you want to use for each 
subtotal.
5.	 In the Add subtotal to group, select the check box next to any field you want to 
summarize.

Look up information in a worksheet
Whenever you create a worksheet that holds information about a list of distinct items, 
such as products offered for sale by a company, you should ensure that at least one 
column in the list contains a unique value that distinguishes that row (and the item 
the row represents) from every other row in the list. Assigning each row a column 
that contains a unique value means that you can associate data in one list with data 
in another list. For example, if you assign every customer a unique identification 
number, you can store a customer’s contact information in one worksheet and all 
orders for that customer in another worksheet. You can then associate the customer’s 
orders and contact information without writing the contact information in a work­
sheet every time the customer places an order.
In technical terms, the column that contains a unique value for each row is known as 
the primary key column. When you look up information in an Excel worksheet, it is 
very useful to position the primary key column as the first column in your list of data.
If you know an item’s primary key value, it’s no trouble to look through a list of 20 or 
30 items to find it. If, however, you have a list of many thousands of items, looking 
through the list to find one would take quite a bit of time. Instead, you can use the 
VLOOKUP function to find the value you want.
An Excel table for use with VLOOKUP
The VLOOKUP function finds a value in the leftmost column of a named range, 
such as a table, and then returns the value from the specified cell to the right of 
the cell with the found value. A properly formed VLOOKUP function has four argu­
ments (data that is passed to the function), as shown in the following definition: 
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup).
184
Chapter 6: Reorder and summarize data

6
The following table summarizes the values Excel expects for each of these arguments.
Argument
Expected value
lookup_value
The value to be found in the first column of the named range 
specified by the table_array argument. The lookup_value 
argument can be a value, a cell reference, or a text string.
table_array
The multicolumn range or name of the range or data table to 
be searched.
col_index_num
The number of the column in the named range that has the 
value to be returned.
range_lookup
A TRUE or FALSE value, indicating whether the function 
should find an approximate match (TRUE) or an exact match 
(FALSE) for the lookup_value. If this argument is left blank, 
the default value for it is TRUE.
IMPORTANT   When range_lookup is left blank or set to TRUE, for VLOOKUP to work 
properly, the rows in the named range specified in the table_array argument must be 
sorted in ascending order based on the values in the leftmost column of the named range.
The VLOOKUP function works a bit differently depending on whether the range_lookup 
argument is set to TRUE or FALSE. The following list summarizes how the function works 
based on the value of range_lookup:
■
■
If the range_lookup argument is left blank or set to TRUE, and VLOOKUP 
doesn’t find an exact match for lookup_value, the function returns the largest 
value that is less than lookup_value.
■
■
If the range_lookup argument is left blank or set to TRUE, and lookup_value is 
smaller than the smallest value in the named range, an #N/A error is returned.
■
■
If the range_lookup argument is left blank or set to TRUE, and lookup_value is 
larger than all values in the named range, the largest value in the named range 
is returned.
■
■
If the range_lookup argument is set to FALSE, and VLOOKUP doesn’t find an 
exact match for lookup_value, the function returns an #N/A error.
185
Look up information in a worksheet

As an example of a VLOOKUP function, consider the following data, which shows 
an Excel table with its headers in row 2 and the first column in column B of the 
worksheet.
CustomerID
Customer
CU01
Fabrikam
CU02
Northwind Traders
CU03
Tailspin Toys
CU04
Contoso
If the =VLOOKUP (E3, B3:C6, 2, FALSE) formula is used, when you enter CU03 in cell E3 
and press Enter, the VLOOKUP function searches the first column of the table, finds an 
exact match, and returns the value Tailspin Toys to cell F3.
A VLOOKUP formula that looks up a customer name when a customer ID is provided
TIP   The related HLOOKUP function matches a value in a column of the first row of a 
table and returns the value in the specified row number of the same column. The letter 
H in the HLOOKUP function name refers to the horizontal layout of the data, just as the V in the 
VLOOKUP function name refers to the data’s vertical layout. For more information on using the 
HLOOKUP function, click the Excel Help button, enter HLOOKUP in the search terms box, and 
then click Search.
IMPORTANT   Be sure to give the cell in which you type the VLOOKUP formula the 
same format as the data you want the formula to display. For example, if you create a 
VLOOKUP formula in cell G14 that finds a date, you must apply a date cell format to cell G14 for 
the result of the formula to display properly.
186
Chapter 6: Reorder and summarize data

To look up worksheet values by using VLOOKUP
1.	 Ensure that the data list includes a unique value in each cell of the leftmost 
column and that the values are sorted in ascending order.
2.	 In the cell where you want to enter the VLOOKUP formula, enter a formula of 
the form =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup).
3.	 Enter TRUE for the range_lookup argument to allow an approximate match.
Or
Enter FALSE for the range_lookup argument to require an exact match.
4.	 Enter a lookup value in the cell named in the VLOOKUP formula’s first 
­argument, and press Enter.

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the Excel2016SBS\Ch07 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
Excel 2016 gives you a wide range of tools with which 
to format, summarize, and present your data. After you 
have created a workbook to hold data about a particular 
subject, you can create as many worksheets as you need 
to make that data easier to find within your workbook. To 
ensure that every year’s workbook has a similar appear­
ance, you can create a workbook with the characteristics 
you want, and save it as a pattern, or template, for similar 
workbooks you will create in the future. 
A consequence of organizing your data into different 
workbooks and worksheets is that you need ways to 
manage, combine, and summarize data from more than 
one Excel document. You can always copy data from one 
worksheet to another, but if the original value were to 
change, that change would not be reflected in the cell 
range to which you copied the data. Rather than remem­
bering which cells you need to update when a value 
changes, you can create a link to the original cell. That 
way, Excel will update the value for you whenever you 
open the workbook. If multiple worksheets hold related 
values, you can use links to summarize those values in a 
single worksheet.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
using a workbook as a template for other workbooks, 
linking to data in other workbooks, and consolidating 
multiple sets of data into a single workbook.
191

Use workbooks as templates for other 
workbooks
After you decide on the type of data you want to store in a workbook and what that 
workbook should look like, you probably want to be able to create similar workbooks 
without adding all of the formatting and formulas again. For example, you might have 
established a design for your monthly sales-tracking workbook.
When you have settled on a design for your workbooks, you can save one of the 
workbooks as a template for similar workbooks you will create in the future. You can 
leave the workbook’s labels to aid in data entry, but you should remove any existing 
data from a workbook that you save as a template, both to avoid data entry errors 
and to remove any confusion as to whether the workbook is a template. You can also 
remove any worksheets you and your colleagues won’t need by right-clicking the tab 
of an unneeded worksheet and, on the shortcut menu that appears, clicking Delete.
TIP  You can also save your Excel 2016 workbook either as an Excel 97–2003 template 
(.xlt) or as a macro-enabled Excel 2016 workbook template (.xltm). For information about 
using macros in Excel 2016 workbooks, see Chapter 12, “Automate repetitive tasks by using 
macros.”
After you save a workbook as a template, you can use it as a model for new 
workbooks. 
IMPORTANT  Be sure to save your Excel template file in the Custom Office Templates 
folder so it’s available for you to use later.

The Backstage view displays available Excel workbook templates
When you create a new workbook by using the tools found in the Backstage view, the 
New page displays the blank workbook template, built-in templates, a search box you 
can use to locate helpful templates on Office.com, and a set of sample search terms.
From the list of available templates, you can click the template you want to use as the 
model for your workbook. Excel creates a new workbook (an .xlsx workbook file, not 
an .xltx template file) with the template’s formatting and contents in place.
193
Use workbooks as templates for other workbooks

In addition to creating a workbook template, you can add a worksheet based on a 
worksheet template to your workbook by using the Insert dialog box.
Add specific worksheet types by using the Insert dialog box
The Insert dialog box splits its contents into two tabs. The General tab contains icons 
you can click to insert a blank worksheet, a chart sheet, and any worksheet templates 
available to you. 
TIP  The other two options on the General tab, MS Excel 4.0 Macro and MS Excel 5.0 
Dialog, are there to help users include solutions built in earlier versions of Excel into 
Excel 2016.
The Spreadsheet Solutions tab contains a set of useful templates for a variety of 
financial and personal tasks. If you want to create a worksheet template, as opposed 
to a workbook template, delete all but one worksheet from your file and save it as a 
template.

Chapter 7: Combine data from multiple sources

Link to data in other worksheets and 
workbooks
Copying and pasting data from one workbook to another is a quick and easy way to 
gather related data in one place, but there is a substantial limitation: If the data from 
the original cell changes, the change is not reflected in the cell to which the data was 
copied. In other words, copying and pasting a cell’s contents doesn’t create a relation­
ship between the original cell and the target cell.
You can ensure that the data in the target cell reflects any changes in the original cell 
by creating a link between the two cells. Instead of entering a value into the target 
cell by typing or pasting, you create a formula that identifies the source from which 
Excel derives the target cell’s value, and that updates the value when it changes in the 
source cell.
You can link to a cell in another workbook by starting to create your formula, display­
ing the worksheet that contains the value you want to use, and then selecting the cell 
or cell range you want to include in the calculation. When you press Enter and switch 
back to the workbook with the target cell, the value in the formula bar shows that 
Excel has filled in the formula with a reference to the cell you clicked.
A 3-D cell reference to another workbook
197
Link to data in other worksheets and workbooks

The reference =‘[FleetOperatingCosts.xlsx]Truck Fuel’!$C$15 gives three pieces of 
information: the workbook, the worksheet, and the cell you linked to in the work­
sheet. The first element of the reference, the name of the workbook, is enclosed in 
brackets; the end of the second element (the worksheet) is marked with an exclama­
tion point; and the third element, the cell reference, has a dollar sign before both the 
row and the column identifier. The single quotes around the workbook name and 
worksheet name are there to allow for the space in the Truck Fuel worksheet’s name. 
This type of reference is known as a 3-D reference, reflecting the three dimensions 
(workbook, worksheet, and cell range) that you need to point to a group of cells in 
another workbook.
TIP  For references to cells in the same workbook, the workbook information is omitted. 
Likewise, references to cells in the same worksheet don’t use a worksheet identifier.
You can also link to cells in an Excel table. Such links include the workbook name, 
worksheet name, the name of the Excel table, and row and column references of the 
cell to which you’ve linked. Creating a link to the Cost column’s cell in a table’s Totals 
row, for example, results in a reference such as =‘FleetOperatingCosts.xlsx’!Truck 
Maintenance[[#Totals],[Cost]].
Link to an Excel table value in another workbook
IMPORTANT  Hiding or displaying a table’s Totals row affects any links to a cell in that 
row. Hiding the Totals row causes references to that row to display a #REF! error message.
Whenever you open a workbook containing a link to another document, Excel tries 
to update the information in linked cells. If the app can’t find the source, as would 
happen if a workbook or worksheet is deleted or renamed, an alert box appears to 
indicate that there is a broken link. From within that alert box, you can access tools 
to fix the link reference.
198
Chapter 7: Combine data from multiple sources

7
A dialog box that indicates that the workbook just opened contains one or more broken links
If you enter a link into a cell and you make an error, a #REF! error message appears in 
the cell that contains the link. 
Cells that contain incorrect links display a #REF! error
To fix the link, click the cell, delete its contents, and then either retype the link or 
create it with the point-and-click method described in the procedures for this topic. 
Excel might also display errors if the cell values in the worksheet cells you link to 
change in value and cause errors such as DIV/0! (divide by zero).
TIP  Excel tracks workbook changes, such as when you change a workbook’s name, very 
well. Unless you delete a worksheet or workbook, or move a workbook to a new folder, 
odds are good that Excel can update your link references automatically to reflect the change.
To create a link to a cell or cell range on another worksheet
1.	 Start creating a formula that will include a value from a cell or cell range on 
another worksheet.
2.	 Click the sheet tab of the worksheet with the cell or cell range you want to 
include in the formula.
3.	 Select the cell or cells to include in the formula.
4.	 Press Enter.

TIP  If you can’t easily fix a link that returns an error, the best choice is often to delete 
the link from the formula and re-create it.
Consolidate multiple sets of data into a 
single workbook
When you create a series of worksheets that contain similar data, perhaps by using a 
template, you build a consistent set of workbooks in which data is stored in a predict­
able place. For example, consider a workbook template used to track the number of 
calls received from 9:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.
Consolidation targets should have labels but no data
Using links to bring data from one worksheet to another gives you a great deal of 
power to combine data from several sources into a single resource. For example, you 
can create a worksheet that lists the number of calls you receive during specific hours 
of the day, use links to draw the values from the worksheets in which the call counts 
were recorded, and then create a formula to perform calculations on the data. How­
ever, for large worksheets with hundreds of cells filled with data, creating links from 
every cell is a time-consuming process. Also, to calculate a sum or an average for the 
data, you would need to include links to cells in every workbook.
202
Chapter 7: Combine data from multiple sources

7
Fortunately, there is an easier way to combine data from multiple worksheets in a 
single worksheet. By using this process, called data consolidation, you can define 
ranges of cells from multiple worksheets and have Excel summarize the data. You 
define these ranges in the Consolidate dialog box.
IMPORTANT  To consolidate data, every range included in the consolidation must be of 
the same shape and size.
Summarize data sets of the same shape by using consolidation
Cells that are in the same relative position in the ranges have their contents summarized 
together. When you consolidate the ranges, the cell in the upper-left corner of one 
range is added to the cell in the upper-left corner of every other range, even if those 
ranges are in different areas of the worksheet. After you choose the ranges to be used 
in your summary, you can choose the calculation to perform on the data. Excel sums the 
data by default, but you can select other functions to summarize the data. 
IMPORTANT  You can define only one data consolidation summary per workbook. 
203
Consolidate multiple sets of data into a single workbook

To consolidate cell ranges from multiple worksheets or workbooks
1.	 Open the workbook into which you want to consolidate your data and the 
workbooks supplying the data for the consolidated range.
2.	 In the workbook into which you want to consolidate your data, on the Data tab, 
in the Data Tools group, click Consolidate.
3.	 In the Consolidate dialog box, click the Collapse Dialog button at the right 
edge of the Reference field to collapse the dialog box.
Clicking the Collapse Dialog button minimizes the Consolidate dialog box
4.	 On the View tab, in the Window group, click Switch Windows and then, in the 
list, click the first workbook that contains data you want to include.
5.	 Select the cell range, click the Expand Dialog button to restore the Consolidate 
dialog box to its full size, and click Add to add the selected range to the All 
references pane.

When you store data in an Excel 2016 workbook, you can 
use that data, either by itself or as part of a calculation, to 
discover important information about your organization. 
You can summarize your data quickly by using the Quick 
Analysis Lens to create charts, calculate totals, or apply 
conditional formatting.
The data in your worksheets is great for answering “what-if” 
questions, such as, “How much money would we save if we 
reduced our labor to 20 percent of our total costs?” You 
can always save an alternative version of a workbook and 
create formulas that calculate the effects of your changes, 
but you can do the same thing in your existing workbooks 
by defining one or more alternative data sets. You can also 
create a data table that calculates the effects of changing 
one or two variables in a formula, find the input values 
required to generate the result you want, and describe 
your data statistically.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
examining data by using the Quick Analysis Lens, defin­
ing an alternative data set, defining multiple alternative 
data sets, analyzing data by using data tables, varying 
data to get a specific result by using Goal Seek, finding 
optimal solutions by using Solver, and analyzing data by 
using descriptive statistics.

Examine data by using the Quick 
Analysis Lens
One useful tool in Excel 2016 is the Quick Analysis Lens, which brings the most com­
monly used formatting, charting, and summary tools into one convenient location. 
After you select the data you want to summarize, clicking the Quick Analysis action 
button displays the tools you can use to analyze your data.
Click the Quick Analysis action button to display analysis tools
TIP  To display the Quick Analysis toolbar by using a keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl+Q.

The Quick Analysis toolbar makes a wide range of tools available, including the ability 
to create an Excel table or PivotTable, insert a chart, or add conditional formatting. 
You can also add total columns and rows to your data range. 
Select from several categories of analysis tools
You can use the tools on the Totals tab of the Quick Analysis toolbar to add summary 
operations to your data. You can add one summary column and one summary row to 
each data range. If you select a new summary column or row when one exists, Excel 
displays a confirmation dialog box to verify that you want to replace the existing 
summary. 
To add formatting by using the Quick Analysis Lens
1.	 Select the cells you want to analyze.
2.	 Click the Quick Analysis action button.
3.	 If necessary, click the Formatting tab.
4.	 Click the button that represents the formatting you want to apply.

3.	 If necessary, click the Tables tab.
4.	 Click the button that represents the type of table you want to create.
Define an alternative data set
When you save data in an Excel worksheet, you create a record that reflects the charac­
teristics of an event or object. That data could represent the number of deliveries in an 
hour on a particular day, the price of a new delivery option, or the percentage of total 
revenue accounted for by a delivery option. After the data is in place, you can create 
formulas to generate totals, find averages, and sort the rows in a worksheet based 
on the contents of one or more columns. However, if you want to perform a what-if 
analysis or explore the impact that changes in your data would have on any of the 
calculations in your workbooks, you need to change your data.
The problem with manipulating data that reflects an event or item is that when you 
change any data to affect a calculation, you run the risk of destroying the original 
data if you accidentally save your changes. You can avoid ruining your original data by 
creating a duplicate workbook and making your changes to it, but you can also create 
an alternative data set, or scenario, within an existing workbook.
When you create a scenario, you give Excel alternative values for a list of cells in a 
worksheet. You can use the Scenario Manager to add, delete, and edit scenarios.
212
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

8
Track and change scenarios by using the Scenario Manager
When you’re ready to add a scenario, you start by providing its name and, if you want, 
a comment describing the scenario. 
TIP  Adding a comment gives you and your colleagues valuable information about the 
scenario and your purpose for creating it. Many Excel users create scenarios without 
comments, but comments are extremely useful when you work on a team or revisit a workbook 
after several months.
213
Define an alternative data set

Define a scenario in the Add Scenario dialog box
After you name your scenario, you can define its values.
Enter alternative data in the Scenario Values dialog box
After you have created your scenario, clicking the Show button in the Scenario 
Manager replaces the values in the original worksheet with the alternative values 
you just defined in the scenario. Any formulas that reference cells with changed 
values will recalculate their results. You can then remove the scenario by clicking the 
Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
214
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

8
IMPORTANT  If you save and close a workbook while a scenario is in effect, those 
values become the default values for the cells changed by the scenario! You should 
seriously consider creating a scenario that contains the original values of the cells you change 
or creating a scenario summary worksheet (a subject covered in the next topic).
The tools available in the Scenario Manager also let you edit your scenarios and delete 
the ones you no longer need.
To define an alternative data set by creating a scenario
1.	 On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click the What-If Analysis button to 
display a menu of the what-if choices, and then click Scenario Manager.
2.	 In the Scenario Manager dialog box, click Add.
3.	 In the Scenario name box, enter a name for the scenario.
4.	 Click in the Changing cells box, and then select the cells you want to change.
5.	 Click OK.
6.	 In the Scenario Values dialog box, enter new values for each of the 
changing cells.
7.	 Click OK.
8.	 Click Close to close the Scenario Manager dialog box.
To display an alternative data set
1.	 On the What-if Analysis menu, click Scenario Manager.
2.	 In the Scenario Manager dialog box, click the scenario you want to display.
3.	 Click Show.
4.	 If you want to close the Scenario Manager dialog box, click Close.
To edit an alternative data set
1.	 On the What-If Analysis menu, click Scenario Manager.
2.	 In the Scenario Manager dialog box, click the scenario you want to edit.
3.	 Click Edit.
215
Define an alternative data set

4.	 In the Edit Scenario dialog box, change the values in the Scenario name, 
Changing cells, or Comment box.
5.	 Click OK.
6.	 In the Scenario Values dialog box, enter new values for each of the 
changing cells.
7.	 Click OK.
8.	 Click Close to close the Scenario Manager dialog box.
To delete an alternative data set
1.	 On the What-if Analysis menu, click Scenario Manager.
2.	 In the Scenario Manager dialog box, click the scenario you want to delete.
3.	 Click Delete.
4.	 Click Close to close the Scenario Manager dialog box.
Define multiple alternative data sets
One great feature of Excel scenarios is that you’re not limited to creating one alterna­
tive data set—you can create as many scenarios as you want and apply them by using 
the Scenario Manager. 
TIP  If you apply a scenario to a worksheet and then apply another scenario to the same 
worksheet, both sets of changes appear. If multiple scenarios change the same cell, the 
cell will contain the value in the most recently applied scenario.
Applying multiple scenarios alters the values in your worksheets. You can see how 
those changes affect your formulas, but Excel also lets you create a record of your 
different scenarios by using the Scenario Summary dialog box. From within the dialog 
box, you can choose the type of summary worksheet you want to create and the cells 
you want to display in the summary worksheet.
216
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

8
Summarize scenarios by using the Scenario Summary dialog box
IMPORTANT  Make sure you don’t have any scenarios applied to your workbook when 
you create the summary worksheet. If you do have an active scenario, Excel will record 
the scenario’s changed values as the originals, and your summary will be inaccurate.
It’s a good idea to create an “undo” scenario named Normal that holds the original 
values of the cells you’re going to change before you change them in other scenarios. 
For example, if you create a scenario that changes the values in three cells, your 
Normal scenario restores those cells to their original values. That way, even if you 
accidentally modify your worksheet, you can apply the Normal scenario and not have 
to reconstruct the worksheet from scratch.
IMPORTANT  Each scenario can change a maximum of 32 cells, so you might need to 
create more than one scenario to ensure that you can restore a worksheet.
To apply multiple alternative data sets
1.	 On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click the What-If Analysis button to 
display a menu of the what-if choices, and then click Scenario Manager.
2.	 In the Scenario Manager dialog box, click the scenario you want to display.
3.	 Click Show.
4.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 for any additional scenarios you want to display.
5.	 Click Close.
217
Define multiple alternative data sets

To create a scenario summary worksheet
1.	 On the What-if Analysis menu, click Scenario Manager.
2.	 In the Scenario Manager dialog box, click Summary.
3.	 In the Scenario Summary dialog box, click Scenario summary.
4.	 Click OK.
Analyze data by using data tables
When you examine business data in Excel, you will often want to discover what the 
result of a formula would be with different input values. In Excel 2016, you can cal­
culate the results of those changes by using a data table. To create a data table with 
one variable, you create a worksheet that contains the data required to calculate the 
variations in the table.
Perform data analysis by changing one variable
IMPORTANT  You must lay out the data and formulas in a rectangle so the data table 
you create will appear in the lower-right corner of the cell range you select.
For example, you can put the formula used to summarize the base data in cell D2, the 
cells with the changing values in the range C3:C5, and the cells to contain the calcula­
tions based on those values in D3:D5. Given the layout of this specific worksheet, you 
would select cells C2:D5, which contain the summary formula, the changing values, 
and the cells where the new calculations should appear.
After you select the data and the formula, you can use the Data Table dialog box to 
perform your analysis.
218
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

8
Identify input cells for your data table
To change a single variable, you identify the cell that contains the summary formula’s 
value that will change in the data table’s cells. In this example, that cell is B3. Because 
the target cells D3:D5 are laid out as a column, you would identify that range as the 
column input cell.
TIP  If your target cells were laid out as a row, you would enter the address of the cell 
containing the value to be changed in the Row Input Cell box.
When you click OK, Excel fills in the results of the data table, using the replacement 
values in cells C3:C5 to provide the values for cells D3:D5.
A completed one-variable data table
To create a two-variable data table, you lay your data out with one set of replacement 
values as row headers and the other set as column headers. 
Two-variable data tables replace both row and column values
219
Analyze data by using data tables

In this example, you would select the cell range C2:E5 and create the data table. 
Because you’re creating a two-variable data table, you need to enter cell addresses 
for both the column input cell and row input cell. The column input cell is B3, which 
represents the rate increase, and the row input cell is B4, which contains the package 
count. When you’re done, Excel creates your data table.
Replacing both row and column values generates multiple outcomes
TIP  For a two-value data table, the summary formula should be the top-left cell in the 
range you select before creating the data table.
To create a one-variable data table
1.	 Create a worksheet with a summary formula, the input values that the summary 
formula uses to calculate its value, and a series of adjacent cells that contain 
alternative values for one of the summary formula’s input values.
2.	 Select the cells representing the summary formula and the changing values, 
and the cells where the alternative summary formula results should appear.
3.	 On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click the What-If Analysis button to 
display a menu of the what-if choices, and then click Data Table.
4.	 In the Data Table dialog box, do either of the following:
●
●
If the changing values appear in a row, in the Row input cell box, enter the 
cell address of the changing value.
●
●
If the changing values appear in a column, in the Column input cell box, 
enter the cell address of the changing value.
5.	 Click OK.
220
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

8
To create a two-variable data table
1.	 Create a worksheet with a summary formula, the input values that the sum­
mary formula uses to calculate its value, and two series of adjacent cells (one in 
a row, one in a column) that contain alternative values for two of the summary 
formula’s input values.
2.	 Select the cells representing the summary formula and the changing values, 
and the cells where the alternative summary formula results should appear.
3.	 On the What-If Analysis menu, click Data Table.
4.	 In the Data Table dialog box, in the Row input cell box, enter the cell address of 
the cell that has alternative values that appear in a worksheet row.
5.	 In the Column input cell box, enter the cell address of the cell that has alternative 
values that appear in a worksheet column.
6.	 Click OK.
Vary your data to get a specific result by 
using Goal Seek
When you run an organization, you must track how every element performs, both in 
absolute terms and in relation to other parts of the organization. There are many ways 
to measure your operations, but one useful technique is to limit the percentage of 
total costs contributed by a specific item.
As an example, consider a worksheet that contains the actual costs and percentage of 
total costs for several production input values.
A worksheet that calculates the percentage of total costs for each of four categories
221
Vary your data to get a specific result by using Goal Seek

Under the current pricing structure, Labor represents 22.79 percent of the total costs 
for the product. If you’d prefer that Labor represent no more than 20 percent of total 
costs, you can change the cost of Labor manually until you find the number you want. 
Rather than do it manually, though, you can use Goal Seek to have Excel find the solu­
tion for you.
When you use Goal Seek, you identify the cell that contains the formula you use to 
evaluate your data, the target value, and the cell you want to change to generate that 
target value. 
Identify the cell that contains the formula you want to use to generate a target value
Clicking OK tells Excel to find a solution for the goal you set. When Excel finishes its 
work, the new values appear in the designated cells, and the Goal Seek Status dialog 
box opens.
IMPORTANT  If you save a workbook with the results of a Goal Seek calculation in 
place, you will overwrite the values in your workbook.
A worksheet where Goal Seek found a solution to a problem
222
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

8
TIP  Goal Seek finds the closest solution it can without exceeding the target value.  
To find a target value by using Goal Seek
1.	 On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click the What-If Analysis button, and 
then click Goal Seek.
2.	 In the Goal Seek dialog box, in the Set cell box, enter the address of the cell 
that contains the formula you want to use to produce a specific value.
3.	 In the To value box, enter the target value for the formula you identified.
4.	 In the By changing cell box, enter the address of the cell that contains the value 
you want to vary to produce the result you want.
5.	 Click OK.
Find optimal solutions by using Solver
Goal Seek is a great tool for finding out how much you need to change a single input 
value to generate a specific result from a formula, but it’s of no help if you want to 
find the best mix of several input values. For more complex problems that seek to 
maximize or minimize results based on several input values and constraints, you need 
to use Solver.
Use Solver to select a product distribution to maximize revenue 
223
Find optimal solutions by using Solver

TIP  It helps to spell out every aspect of your problem so that you can identify the cells 
you want Solver to use in its calculations.
If you performed a complete installation when you installed Excel on your computer, 
the Solver button will appear on the Data tab in the Analyze group. If not, you can 
install the Solver add-in from the Add-Ins page of the Excel Options dialog box. After 
the installation is complete, Solver appears on the Data tab, in the Analyze group, and 
you can create your model.
Create a Solver model by using the Solver Parameters dialog box
The first step in setting up your Solver problem is to identify the cell that contains 
the summary formula you want to establish as your objective, followed by indicating 
whether you want to minimize the cell’s value, maximize the cell’s value, or make the 
224
Chapter 8: Analyze alternative data sets

cell take on a specific value. Next, you select the cells Solver should vary to change the 
value in the objective cell. You can, if you want, require Solver to find solutions that 
use only integer values (that is, values that are whole numbers and have no decimal 
component).
IMPORTANT  Finding integer-only solutions, or integer programming, is much harder 
than finding solutions that allow decimal values. It might take Solver several minutes to 
find a solution or to discover that a solution using just integer values isn’t possible.
Next, you create constraints that will set the limits for the values Solver can use. The 
best way to set your constraints is to specify them in your worksheet. Basing Solver 
constraints on worksheet cell values lets you add labels and explanatory text in 
neighboring cells and change the constraints quickly, without opening the Solver 
Parameters dialog box.
TIP  After you run Solver, you can use the commands in the Solver Results dialog box 
to save the results as changes to your worksheet or create a scenario based on the 
changed data.
Finally, you need to select the solving method that Solver will use to look for a solu­
tion to your problem. There are three options, each of which works best for a specific 
type of problem:
■
■
Simplex LP  Used to solve problems where all of the calculations are linear, 
meaning they don’t involve exponents or other non-linear elements.
■
■
GRG Nonlinear  Used to solve problems where the calculations involve 
­exponents or other non-linear mathematical elements.
■
■
Evolutionary  Uses genetic algorithms to find a solution. This method is quite 
complex and can take far longer to run than either of the other two engines, 
but if neither the Simplex LP or GRG Nonlinear engines can find a solution, the 
Evolutionary engine might be able to.
TIP  If you’re using the Simplex LP engine and Solver returns an error immediately, 
indicating that it can’t find a solution, try using the GRG Nonlinear engine.

Analyze data by using descriptive statistics
Experienced business people can tell a lot about numbers just by looking at them 
to determine if they “look right.” That is, the sales figures are approximately where 
they’re supposed to be for a particular hour, day, or month; the average seems about 
right; and sales have increased from year to year. When you need more than an infor­
mal assessment, however, you can use the tools in the Analysis ToolPak.

instructions, see the introduction.
When you enter data into an Excel 2016 worksheet, you 
create a record of important events, whether they are 
individual sales, sales for an hour of a day, or the price 
of a product. What a list of values in cells can’t commu­
nicate easily, however, is the overall trends in the data. 
The best way to communicate trends in a large collec­
tion of data is by creating a chart, which summarizes 
data visually. In addition to the standard charts, with 
Excel 2016 you can create compact charts called spark­
lines, which summarize a data series by using a graph 
contained within a single cell.
You have a great deal of control over the appearance of 
your chart—you can change the color of any chart ele­
ment, choose a different chart type to better summarize 
the underlying data, and change the display properties of 
text and numbers in a chart. If the data in the worksheet 
used to create a chart represents a progression through 
time, such as sales over several months, you can have 
Excel extrapolate future sales and add a trendline to the 
graph representing that prediction.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating a chart (including six chart types that are new in 
Excel 2016), customizing chart elements, finding trends 
in your data, summarizing data by using sparklines, and 
creating and formatting shapes, diagrams, and shapes 
containing mathematical equations.
237

Create charts
Excel 2016 lets you create charts quickly by using the Quick Analysis Lens, which dis­
plays recommended charts to summarize your data. When you select the entire data 
range you want to chart, clicking the Quick Analysis action button lets you display the 
types of charts Excel recommends.
Use the Quick Analysis Lens to add a chart to your worksheet
You can display a preview of each recommended chart by pointing to the icon 
representing that chart.
TIP  Press the F11 key to create a chart of the default type on a new chart sheet. Unless 
you or another user changed the default, Excel creates a column chart. For more 
information about keyboard shortcuts, see “Keyboard shortcuts” at the end of this book.

Display a live preview of a chart
Clicking the icon adds the chart to your worksheet. 
If the chart you want to create doesn’t appear in the list of charts recommended by 
the Quick Analysis Lens, you can select the chart type you want from a gallery on the 
Insert tab of the ribbon. When you point to a subtype in the gallery, Excel displays a 
preview of the chart you will create by clicking that subtype.
Create charts
239

Create charts by using tools on the Insert tab of the ribbon
When you click a chart subtype, Excel creates the chart by using the default layout 
and color scheme defined in your workbook’s theme.
If Excel doesn’t plot your data the way you want it to, you can change the axis on 
which Excel plots a data column. The most common reason for incorrect data plot­
ting is that the column to be plotted on the horizontal axis contains numerical data 
instead of textual data. For example, if your data includes a Year column and a Volume 
column, instead of plotting volume data for each consecutive year along the hori­
zontal axis, Excel plots both of those columns in the body of the chart and creates a 
sequential series to provide values for the horizontal axis.
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
240

9
A chart with horizontal axis labels plotted as data
You can change which data Excel applies to the vertical axis (also known as the y-axis) 
and the horizontal axis (also known as the x-axis). If Excel has swapped the values for 
the vertical and horizontal axes, you can switch the row and column data to update 
your chart. If the problem is a little more involved, you can edit how Excel interprets 
your source data.
Create charts
241

Change how Excel plots your data by using the Select Data Source dialog box
The Year column should appear on the horizontal axis as a data category, which Excel 
refers to as the axis labels. 
Identify horizontal (category) labels by using the Axis Labels dialog box
After you identify the cell range that provides the values for your axis labels, Excel will 
revise your chart.

A chart with horizontal and vertical axis values plotted correctly
After you create your chart, you can change its size to reflect whether the chart 
should dominate its worksheet or take on a role as another informative element on 
the worksheet. 
Just as you can control a chart’s size, you can also control its location. You can drag 
a chart to a new location on its current worksheet, move the chart to another work­
sheet, or move the chart to its own chart sheet.

Create new types of charts
Excel 2016 introduces six new types of charts: waterfall, histogram, Pareto, box-and-
whisker, treemap, and sunburst. Each of these new chart types enhances your ability 
to summarize your data and convey meaningful information about your business.
Waterfall charts summarize financial data by distinguishing increases from decreases 
and indicating whether a particular line item is an individual account, such as Direct 
Materials, or a broader measure, such as Starting Balance or Ending Balance.
Use waterfall charts to summarize financial data
Excel doesn’t automatically recognize which entries should be treated as totals, but 
you can double-click any columns that represent totals (or subtotals) and identify 
them so Excel knows how to handle them.
Histograms, which were previously available as part of the Data Analysis ToolPak, are 
now part of the standard Excel chart package. A histogram counts the number of occur­
rences of values within a set of ranges, where each range is called a bin. For example, a 
summary of daily package volumes for a delivery area could fall into several ranges.
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
248

9
Histograms summarize values by using groups called bins
A Pareto chart combines a histogram and a line chart to show both the contributions 
of categories of values, such as package delivery options (for example, overnight, 
priority overnight, and ground), and the cumulative contributions after each category 
is counted.
Pareto charts show category revenue and share of the total
A box-and-whisker chart combines several statistical measures, including the aver­
age (or mean), median, minimum, and maximum values for a data series, into a single 
chart. These charts provide a compact yet informative view of your data from a statis­
tical standpoint.
Create new types of charts
249

Box-and-whisker charts provide graphic statistical summaries
The treemap chart divides data into categories, which are represented by colors, and 
shows the hierarchy of values within each category by using the size of the rectangles 
within the category. For example, you could represent regional frequencies for each 
package delivery option available to customers.
Treemap charts display contributions from elements of each data category
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
250

A sunburst chart breaks down a data set’s hierarchy to an even deeper level, showing 
the details of how much each subcategory of data contributes to the whole.
Sunburst charts show category contributions in detail
To create a waterfall chart
1.	 Select the data you want to visualize.
2.	 On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the Insert Waterfall or Stock Chart 
button.
3.	 Click the Waterfall chart type.
4.	 If necessary, identify a column as a total by clicking the column once to select 
the series, clicking the column again to select it individually, right-clicking the 
column, and then clicking Set as Total.

Customize your chart by using the action buttons that appear beside the chart
The Chart Styles gallery has two tabs: Style and Color. The Style tab contains 14 styles 
from which to choose, and the Color tab displays a series of color schemes you can 
select to change your chart’s appearance.
TIP  If you prefer to work with the ribbon, these same styles appear in the Chart Styles 
gallery on the Design tab.
Select a color palette for your chart
Customize chart appearance
253

TIP  The colors and styles in the Chart Styles gallery are tied to your workbook’s theme. 
If you change your workbook’s theme, Excel changes your chart’s appearance to reflect 
the new theme’s colors.
When you create a chart, Excel creates a visualization that focuses on the data. In 
most cases, the chart has a title, a legend (a list of the data series displayed in the 
chart), horizontal lines in the body of the chart to make it easier to discern individual 
values, and axis labels. If you want to create a chart that has more or different ele­
ments, such as additional data labels for each data point plotted on your chart, you 
can do so by selecting a new layout. If it’s still not quite right, you can show or hide 
individual elements by using the Chart Elements action button.
Click the Chart Elements action button to display or hide elements in the active chart
After you select a chart element, you can change its size and appearance by using 
controls specifically created to work with that element type.

Selecting or clearing a check box displays or hides data related to a specific value 
within a series. You can also use the check boxes in the Series section of the panel to 
display or hide entire data series. 
If you think you want to apply the same set of changes to charts you’ll create in the 
future, you can save your chart as a chart template. When you select the data you 
want to summarize visually and apply the chart template, you’ll create consistently 
formatted charts in a minimum of steps.

Find trends in your data
You can use the data in Excel workbooks to discover how your business has performed 
in the past, but you can also have Excel 2016 make its best guess, for example, as to 
future shipping revenues if the current trend continues. As an example, consider a line 
chart that shows package volume data for the years 2009 through 2015.
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
260

9
Line chart that shows data over time
The total has increased from 2009 to 2015, but the growth hasn’t been uniform, so 
guessing how much package volume would increase if the overall trend continued 
would require detailed mathematical computations. Fortunately, Excel knows that 
math and can use it to add a trendline to your data.
Create a trendline to forecast future data values
You can choose the data distribution that Excel should expect when it makes its projec­
tion. The right choice for most business data is Linear—the other distributions (such 
as Exponential, Logarithmic, and Polynomial) are used for scientific and operations 
research applications. You can also tell how far ahead Excel should look—looking 
ahead by zero periods shows the best-fit line for the current data set, whereas looking 
ahead two periods would project two periods into the future, assuming current trends 
continued.
Find trends in your data
261

Change trendline characteristics by using the Format Trendline task pane
TIP  When you click the Trendline button in the Analysis group, one of the options Excel 
displays is Linear Forecast Trendline, which adds a trendline with a two-period forecast.
As with other chart elements, you can double-click the trendline to open a formatting 
dialog box and change the line’s appearance.
To add a trendline to a chart
1.	 Click the chart to which you want to add a trendline.
2.	 On the Design tool tab, in the Chart Layouts group, click the Add Chart 
Element button.
3.	 Point to Trendline and click the type of trendline you want to add.
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
262

9
To edit a trendline’s properties and appearance
1.	 Click the chart that contains the trendline.
2.	 On the Format tool tab, in the Current Selection group, click the Chart 
Elements arrow.
3.	 Click the element that ends with the word Trendline.
4.	 Click Format Selection.
5.	 Use the controls in the Format Trendline task pane to edit the trendline’s 
properties and appearance.
To delete a trendline
1.	 Click the trendline.
2.	 Press the Delete key.
Create dual-axis charts
The Excel 2016 charting engine is powerful, but it does have its quirks. Some data col­
lections you might want to summarize in Excel will have more than one value related 
to each category. For example, each regional center for a package delivery company 
could have both overall package volume and revenue for the year. You can restructure 
the data in your Excel table to create a dual-axis chart, or combo chart, which uses two 
vertical axes to show both value sets in the same chart.
TIP  A Pareto chart, discussed earlier in this chapter, is a specific type of dual-axis chart. 
To create a dual-axis chart
1.	 Select the data you want to visualize.
2.	 On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the Insert Combo Chart button.
3.	 Click the type of combo chart you want to create.
Or
Click Create Custom Combo Chart and use the settings in the Combo category 
of the All Charts tab to define your combo chart.
Create dual-axis charts
263

Summarize your data by using sparklines
You can create charts in Excel to summarize your data visually, by using legends, labels, 
and colors to highlight aspects of your data. It is possible to create very small charts 
to summarize your data in an overview worksheet, but you can also use a sparkline to 
create a compact, informative chart that provides valuable context for your data.
Edward Tufte introduced sparklines in his book Beautiful Evidence (Graphics Press, 
2006), with the goal of creating charts that imparted their information in approxi­
mately the same space as a word of printed text. In Excel, a sparkline occupies a single 
cell, which makes it ideal for use in summary worksheets. 
Data that Excel can summarize by using sparklines
You can create three types of sparklines: line, column, and win/loss. The line and column 
spark­lines are compact versions of the standard line and column charts. The win/loss 
spark­line indicates whether a cell value is positive (a win), negative (a loss), or zero (a tie). 
Examples of line, column, and win/loss sparklines
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
264

9
After you create a sparkline, you can change its appearance. Because a sparkline takes 
up the entire interior of a single cell, resizing that cell’s row or column resizes the 
sparkline. You can also change a sparkline’s formatting, modify its labels, or delete it 
entirely. 
Format sparklines by using tools on the Sparkline Tools Design tool tab of the ribbon
TIP  Remember that sparklines work best when displayed in compact form. If you find 
yourself adding markers and labels to a sparkline, you might consider using a regular 
chart to take advantage of its wider range of formatting and customization options.
To create a sparkline
1.	 Select the data you want to visualize.
2.	 On the Insert tab, in the Sparklines group, do one of the following:
●
●
Click the Line button.
●
●
Click the Column button.
●
●
Click the Win/Loss button.

Create diagrams by using SmartArt
Businesses define processes to manage product development, sales, and other essen­
tial functions. Excel 2016 comes with a selection of built-in diagram types, referred to 
as SmartArt, that you can use to illustrate processes, lists, and hierarchies within your 
organization.
Create SmartArt graphics by using the Choose A SmartArt Graphic dialog box
Chapter 9: Create charts and graphics
266

Clicking one of the buttons in the dialog box selects the type of diagram the button 
represents and causes a description of the diagram type to appear in the rightmost 
pane of the dialog box. The following table lists the nine categories of diagrams from 
which you can choose.

TIP  Some of the diagram types can be used to illustrate several types of relationships. 
Be sure to examine all your options before you decide on the type of diagram to use to 
illustrate your point.
After you click the button representing the type of diagram you want to create, click­
ing OK adds the diagram to your worksheet. As with other drawing objects and shapes, 
you can move, copy, and delete the SmartArt diagram as needed.

1.	 Right-click the diagram, and then click Cut.
Create shapes and mathematical equations
With Excel, you can analyze your worksheet data in many ways, including summariz­
ing your data and business processes visually by using charts and SmartArt. You can 
also augment your worksheets by adding objects such as geometric shapes, lines, 
flowchart symbols, and banners.
TIP  A SmartArt diagram is a collection of shapes that Excel treats as a collective 
unit. The shapes described in this topic are individual objects that Excel manages 
independently.
After you draw a shape on a worksheet, or select it after you’ve drawn it, you can use 
the controls on the Format tool tab of the ribbon to change its appearance.
Change shape formatting by using tools on the Drawing Tools Format tool tab
TIP  Holding down the Shift key while you draw a shape keeps the shape’s proportions 
constant. For example, clicking the Rectangle tool and then holding down the Shift key 
while you draw the shape causes you to draw a square.
You can resize a shape by clicking the shape and then dragging one of the resizing 
handles around the edge of the shape. You can drag a handle on a side of the shape to 
drag that side to a new position; if you drag a handle on the corner of the shape, you 
affect height and width simultaneously. If you hold down the Shift key while you drag a 
shape’s corner, Excel keeps the shape’s height and width in proportion as you drag the 
corner. You can also rotate a shape until it is in the orientation you want.
Create shapes and mathematical equations
271

TIP  You can assign your shape a specific height and width by clicking the shape and 
then, on the Format tool tab, in the Size group, entering the values you want in the 
Height and Width boxes.
After you create a shape, you can use the controls on the Format tool tab to change 
its formatting. You can apply predefined styles or use the Shape Fill, Shape ­Outline, and 
Shape Effects buttons’ options to change those aspects of the shape’s appearance.
TIP  When you point to a formatting option, such as a style or option displayed in the 
Shape Fill, Shape Outline, or Shape Effects lists, Excel displays a live preview of how your 
shape would appear if you applied that formatting option. You can preview as many options as 
you want before committing to a change.
If you want to use a shape as a label or header in a worksheet, you can add text to the 
shape’s interior by clicking the shape and typing. If you want to edit a shape’s text, 
point to the text. When the mouse pointer is in position, it will change from a white 
pointer with a four-pointed arrow to a black I-bar. You can then click the text to start 
editing it or change its formatting.
Add text to shapes to make your labels stand out
You can move a shape within your worksheet by dragging it to a new position. If your 
worksheet contains multiple shapes, you can align and distribute them within the 
worksheet. Aligning shapes horizontally means arranging them so they are lined up 
by their top edge, bottom edge, or horizontal center. Aligning them vertically means

lining them up so that they have the same right edge, left edge, or vertical center. 
Distributing shapes moves the shapes so they have a consistent horizontal or vertical 
distance between them. 
If you have multiple shapes on a worksheet, you will find that Excel arranges them 
from front to back, placing newer shapes in front of older shapes.
Align shapes to make more attractive worksheets
You can change the order of the shapes to create exactly the arrangement you want, 
whether by moving a shape one step forward or backward, or moving it all the way to 
the front or back of the stack. 
One other way to enhance your Excel files is to add mathematical equations to a 
worksheet. You can create a wide range of formulas by using built-in structures and 
symbols.
Build an equation by using the tools on the Equation Tools Design tool tab of the ribbon
TIP  Clicking the arrow next to the Equation button at the left end of the Equation Tools 
tab displays a list of common equations, such as the Pythagorean Theorem, that you can 
add with a single click.

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the Excel2016SBS\Ch10 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
When you create Excel 2016 worksheets, you must con­
sider how you want the data to appear when you show 
it to your colleagues. You can change the formatting of 
your data to emphasize the contents of specific cells, 
sort and filter your worksheets based on the contents of 
specific columns, or hide rows containing data that isn’t 
relevant to the point you’re trying to make.
One limitation of the standard Excel worksheet is that 
you can’t easily change how the data is organized on the 
page. There is an Excel tool with which you can create 
worksheets that can be sorted, filtered, and rearranged 
dynamically to emphasize different aspects of your data. 
That tool is the PivotTable.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating and editing PivotTables from an existing work­
sheet, focusing your PivotTable data by using filters and 
Slicers, formatting PivotTables, creating a PivotTable with 
data imported from a text file, and summarizing your 
data visually by using a PivotChart.
281

Analyze data dynamically by using 
PivotTables
In Excel worksheets, you can gather and present important data, but the standard 
worksheet can’t be changed from its original configuration easily. As an example, 
consider a worksheet that records monthly package volumes for each of nine distri­
bution centers in the United States.
Static worksheets summarize data one way
The data in the worksheet is organized so that each row represents a distribution 
center and each column represents a month of the year. 
Such a neutral presentation of your data is useful, but it has limitations. First, although 
you can use sorting and filtering to restrict the rows or columns shown, it’s difficult to 
change the worksheet’s organization. For example, in this worksheet, you can’t easily 
reorganize the contents of your worksheet so that the months are assigned to the 
rows and the distribution centers are assigned to the columns.
282
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
The Excel tool you can use to reorganize and redisplay your data dynamically is the 
PivotTable. In Excel 2016, you can quickly create a PivotTable from the Recommended 
PivotTables dialog box. 
Excel analyzes your data and recommends PivotTable layouts
Pointing to a recommended PivotTable shows a preview of what that PivotTable 
would look like if you clicked that option, so you can view several possibilities before 
deciding which one to create. 
TIP  If Excel 2016 has no recommended PivotTables for your data, it gives you the option 
to create a blank PivotTable.
283
Analyze data dynamically by using PivotTables

If none of the recommended PivotTables meet your needs, you can create a Pivot­
Table by adding individual fields. For instance, you can create a PivotTable with the 
same layout as the worksheet described previously, which emphasizes totals by 
month, and then change the PivotTable layout to have the rows represent the months 
of the year and the columns represent the distribution centers. The new layout 
emphasizes the totals by regional distribution center.
Reorganize your PivotTable by changing the order of fields
To create a PivotTable quickly, you must have your data collected in a list. Excel tables 
mesh perfectly with PivotTable dynamic views; Excel tables have a well-defined 
column and row structure, and the ability to refer to an Excel table by its name greatly 
simplifies PivotTable creation and management.
In an Excel table used to create a PivotTable, each row of the table should contain a 
value representing the attribute described by each column. Columns could include 
data on distribution centers, years, months, days, weekdays, and package volumes, for 
example. Excel needs that data when it creates the PivotTable so that it can maintain 
relationships among the data. 
IMPORTANT  It’s okay if some cells in the source data list or Excel table are blank, but 
the source shouldn’t contain any blank rows. If Excel encounters a blank row while 
creating a PivotTable, it stops looking for additional data.
284
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
Use an Excel table or list of data to create a PivotTable
After you identify the data you want to summarize, you can start creating your 
PivotTable.
Verify the data source and target location of your PivotTable
In most cases, the best choice is to place your new PivotTable on its own worksheet to 
avoid cluttering the display. If you do want to put it on an existing worksheet, perhaps 
as part of a summary worksheet with multiple visualizations, you can do so.
285
Analyze data dynamically by using PivotTables

Add a blank PivotTable to a worksheet, then add data and organization
PivotTables have four areas where you can place fields: Rows, Columns, Values, and 
Filters. To define your PivotTable’s data structure, drag field names from the Pivot­
Table field list to the four areas at the bottom of the PivotTable Fields task pane.  
Adding a data field to the Values area summarizes all values in that field
It’s important to note that the order in which you enter the fields in the Rows and 
Columns areas affects how Excel organizes the data in your PivotTable. As an example, 
consider a PivotTable that groups the PivotTable rows by distribution center and then 
by month.
286
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
A PivotTable with package volume data arranged by distribution center and then by month
The same PivotTable data could also be organized by month and then by distribution 
center.

287
Analyze data dynamically by using PivotTables

In the preceding examples, all the field headers are in the Rows area. If you drag 
the Distribution Center header from the Rows area to the Columns area in the 
­Pivot­Table Fields pane, the PivotTable reorganizes (pivots) its data to form a different 
configuration.
A PivotTable arranged in cross-tabular format
If your data set is large or if you based your PivotTable on a data collection on another 
computer, it might take some time for Excel to reorganize the PivotTable after a pivot. 
You can have Excel delay redrawing the PivotTable until you’re ready for Excel to 
­display the reorganized contents.
If you expect your PivotTable source data to change, such as when you link to an exter­
nal database, you should ensure that your PivotTable summarizes all the available data. 
To do that, you can refresh the PivotTable connection to its data source. If Excel detects 
new data in the source table, it updates the PivotTable contents accordingly. 
To organize your data for use in a PivotTable
1.	 Do either of the following:
●
●
Create an Excel table.
●
●
Create a data list that contains no blank rows or columns and has no 
extraneous data surrounding the list.
288

2.	 When you want to update your PivotTable, click Update.
3.	 To turn updating back on, clear the Defer Layout Update check box.
Filter, show, and hide PivotTable data
PivotTables often summarize huge data sets in a relatively small worksheet. The more 
details you can capture and write to a table, the more flexibility you have in analyzing 
the data. As an example, consider all the details captured in a table in which each row 
contains a value representing the distribution center, date, month, week, weekday, 
day, and volume for every day of the year. You could filter this data to only display 
values for Mondays.
Filter Excel tables to focus on relevant data
290
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
Each column, in turn, contains numerous values: there are nine distribution centers, 
data from two years, 12 months in a year, seven weekdays, and as many as five weeks 
and 31 days in a month. Just as you can filter the data that appears in an Excel table 
or other data collection, you can filter the data displayed in a PivotTable by selecting 
which values you want the PivotTable to include.
Filter a PivotTable by clicking a filter arrow
SEE ALSO  For more information about filtering an Excel table, see “Limit data that 
appears on your screen” in Chapter 5, “Manage worksheet data.”
Clicking the column header in the PivotTable displays several sorting options, commands 
for different categories of filters, and a list of items that appear in the field you want to 
filter. Every list item has a check box next to it. Items whose check boxes are selected 
are currently displayed in the PivotTable, and items whose check boxes are cleared 
are hidden.
The first entry at the top of the item list is the Select All check box. The Select All 
check box can have one of three states: displaying a check mark (selected), displaying 
291
Filter, show, and hide PivotTable data

a black square, or cleared. If the Select All check box contains a check mark, the Pivot­
Table displays every item in the list. If the Select All check box is cleared, no filter items 
are selected. Finally, if the Select All check box contains a black square, it means that 
some, but not all, of the items in the list are displayed. Selecting only the Northwest 
check box, for example, leads to a PivotTable configuration in which only the data for 
the Northwest center is displayed.
Limit data by using selection filters
If you’d rather display PivotTable data on the entire worksheet, you can hide the Pivot­
Table Fields pane and filter the PivotTable by using the filter arrows on the Row Labels 
and Column Labels headers within the body of the PivotTable. Excel indicates that a 
PivotTable has filters applied by placing a filter indicator next to the Column Labels or 
Row Labels header, as appropriate, and next to the filtered field name in the Pivot­
Table Fields task pane.
So far, all the fields by which we’ve talked about filtering the PivotTable will change 
the organization of the data in the PivotTable. Adding some fields to a PivotTable, 
however, might create unwanted complexity. For example, you might want to filter 
a PivotTable by month, but adding the Month field to the body of the PivotTable 
expands the table unnecessarily.
292
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
Adding multiple fields to an area expands PivotTables substantially
Instead of adding the Month field to the Rows or Columns area, adding the field to 
the Filters area leaves the body of the PivotTable unchanged, but adds a new filter 
control above the PivotTable in its worksheet. When you click the filter arrow of a field 
in the Filters area, Excel displays a list of the values in the field. You can choose to filter 
based on one or more values.
Add a field to the Filter area to filter a PivotTable without changing its organization
293
Filter, show, and hide PivotTable data

TIP  In Excel 2003 and earlier versions, the Filter area was called the Page Field area. 
If your PivotTable has more than one field in the Rows area of the PivotTable Fields 
pane, you can filter values in a PivotTable by hiding and collapsing levels of detail 
within the report. To do that, you click the Hide Detail control (which looks like a box 
with a minus sign in it) or the Show Detail control (which looks like a box with a plus 
sign in it) next to a header.
Summarize levels of data by using the Show Detail and Hide Detail controls
TIP  If a PivotTable area, such as Rows or Columns, contains more than one field, you 
can select the field by which to filter by clicking the Select Field arrow and clicking the 
field you want.
294
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
Excel 2016 provides two other ways for you to filter PivotTables: search filters and Slicers. 
By using a search filter, you can enter a series of characters for Excel to use to filter 
that field’s values. 
Filter a PivotTable field by using a search filter
TIP  Search filters look for the character string you specify anywhere within a field’s 
value, not just at the start of the value. In the previous example, the search filter string 
“cen” would return both Central and North Central.
295
Filter, show, and hide PivotTable data

In versions of Excel prior to Excel 2013, the only visual indication that you had applied 
a filter to a field was the indicator added to a field’s filter arrow. The indicator told 
users that there was an active filter applied to that field but provided no information 
on which values were displayed and which were hidden. In Excel 2016, Slicers provide 
a visual indication of which items are currently displayed or hidden in a PivotTable.
When you’re ready to create a Slicer, you display the Insert Slicers dialog box and 
select the data you want to filter.
Select fields for which you want to display a Slicer
296
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
After you make your selections, Excel displays a Slicer for each field you identified.
Slicers provide visually summarized values affected by filters
TIP  If you have already applied a filter to the field for which you display a Slicer, the 
Slicer reflects the filter’s result.
A Slicer displays the values within the PivotTable field you identified. Any value dis­
played in color (or gray if you have a gray-and-white color scheme) appears within the 
PivotTable. Values displayed in light gray or white do not appear in the PivotTable.
Clicking an item in a Slicer changes that item’s state—if a value is currently displayed 
in a PivotTable, clicking it hides it. If it’s hidden, clicking its value in the Slicer displays it 
in the PivotTable. As with other objects in an Excel 2016 workbook, you can use the Shift 
and Ctrl keys to help define your selections. 
Clicking a value creates a filter that limits the data displayed to only that value, and click­
ing a selected value removes it from the filter. If you want to display values related to 
multiple items in the Slicer, click the Multi-Select button on the Slicer’s title bar.
297
Filter, show, and hide PivotTable data

Select multiple items in a Slicer by using Multi-Select
Now when you click additional items, Excel adds them to the Slicer instead of replacing 
the original selection. You can also select multiple values by holding down the Ctrl key 
and clicking individual values, or by holding down the Shift key and clicking two values 
in sequence, which selects the two values you clicked and all values between them.
Slicers provide a visual reference for filtered fields
298
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
As with other drawing objects in Excel, you can move and resize the Slicer as needed. 
When you’re done filtering values, you can clear the Slicer filter and get rid of the 
Slicer entirely.
TIP  You can change a Slicer’s formatting by clicking the Slicer and then, on the Slicer 
Tools Options tool tab on the ribbon, clicking a style in the Slicer Styles gallery.

Edit PivotTables
After you create a PivotTable, you can rename it, edit it to control how it summarizes 
your data, and use the PivotTable cell data in a formula. As an example, consider a 
PivotTable named PivotTable1 that summarizes package volume data.
PivotTables summarize large data sets in a compact format
301
Edit PivotTables

Excel assigns the PivotTable a name, such as PivotTable1, when you create it. Of course, 
the name PivotTable1 doesn’t help you or your colleagues understand the data the 
PivotTable contains, particularly if you use the PivotTable data in a formula on another 
worksheet. You can provide more information about your PivotTable and the data it 
contains by changing its name to something more descriptive.
When you create a PivotTable with at least one field in the Rows area and one field 
in the Columns area of the PivotTable Fields pane, Excel adds a grand total row and 
column to summarize your data. You can control which totals and subtotals appear, 
and where they appear, to best suit your data and analysis goals.
After you create a PivotTable, Excel determines the best way to summarize the data in 
the column you assign to the Values area. For numeric data, for example, Excel uses 
the SUM function, but you can change the function used to summarize your data.
Control how your PivotTable summarizes your values
You can also change how the PivotTable displays the data in the Values area. Some of 
those methods include displaying each value as a percentage of the grand total, row 
total, or column total, or as a running total.

Format PivotTables
PivotTables are the ideal tools for summarizing and examining large data tables, 
even those containing more than 10,000 or even 100,000 rows. Although PivotTables 
often end up as compact summaries, you should do everything you can to make your 
data more comprehensible. One way to improve your data’s readability is to apply a 
number format to the PivotTable Values field. 
SEE ALSO  For more information about selecting and defining cell formats by using the 
Format Cells dialog box, see “Format cells” in Chapter 4, “Change workbook appearance.”
Analysts often use PivotTables to summarize and examine organizational data for 
the purpose of making important decisions about the company. Excel extends the 
capabilities of your PivotTables by enabling you to apply a conditional format to the 
PivotTable cells. Additionally, you can select whether to apply the conditional format 
to every cell in the Values area, to every cell at the same level as the selected cell (that 
is, a regular data cell, a subtotal cell, or a grand total cell), or to every cell that contains 
or draws its values from the selected cell’s field.
305
Format PivotTables

Summarize values visually by adding a conditional format
When you apply a conditional format to a PivotTable, Excel displays a Formatting 
Options action button, which offers three options for applying the conditional format:
■
■
Selected Cells  Applies the conditional format to the selected cells only
■
■
All Cells Showing Sum of field_name Values  Applies the conditional format 
to every cell in the body of the PivotTable that contains data, regardless of 
whether the cell is in the data area, a subtotal row or column, or a grand total 
row or column
■
■
All Cells Showing Sum of field_name Values for Fields  Applies the conditional 
format to every cell at the same level (for example, data cell, subtotal, or grand 
total) as the selected cells
SEE ALSO  For more information about creating conditional formats, see “Change the 
appearance of data based on its value” in Chapter 4, “Change workbook appearance.”
306
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
In Excel, you can take full advantage of the Microsoft Office system enhanced format­
ting capabilities to apply existing formats to your PivotTables. Just as you can create 
Excel table formats, you can also create your own PivotTable formats to match your 
organization’s preferred color scheme. After you give the new style a name, you can 
format each element of PivotTables to which you apply the style.
Define custom styles by using the New PivotTable Style dialog box
The Design tool tab contains many other tools you can use to format your PivotTable, 
but one of the most useful is the Banded Columns check box. If you select a Pivot­
Table style that offers banded rows as an option, selecting the Banded Rows check 
box turns banding on. If you prefer not to have Excel band the rows in your Pivot­
Table, clearing the check box turns banding off.
To apply a number format to PivotTable data
1.	 Click any data cell in the body of the PivotTable.
2.	 On the Analyze tool tab, in the Active Field group, click Field Settings.
3.	 In the Value Field Settings dialog box, click the Number Format button.
4.	 Use the tools on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box to define 
a number format for your PivotTable data field.

Create PivotTables from external data
Although most of the time you will create PivotTables from data stored in Excel 
worksheets, you can also bring data from outside sources into Excel. For example, 
you might need to work with data created in another spreadsheet program with a file 
format that Excel can’t read directly. Fortunately, you can export the data from the 
original program into a text file, which Excel then translates into a worksheet.
TIP  The data import technique shown here isn’t exclusive to PivotTables. You can use 
this procedure to bring data into your worksheets for any purpose.
Spreadsheet programs store data in cells, so the goal of representing spreadsheet 
data in a text file is to indicate where the contents of one cell end and those of the 
next cell begin. The character that marks the end of a cell is a delimiter, in that it 
marks the end (or “limit”) of a cell. The most common cell delimiter is the comma, so 
the delimited sequence 15, 18, 24, 28 represents data in four cells. The problem with 
using commas to delimit financial data is that larger values—such as 52,802—can be 
written by using commas as thousands markers. To avoid confusion when importing a 
text file, some financial data programs export their data by using the tab character as 
a delimiter.
TIP  You can open files in which the values are separated by commas, called comma-
separated value files, directly into Excel. These files often have .csv extensions.
To start importing data from a text file, you identify the file that contains the data you 
want to work with.
309
Create PivotTables from external data

Identify the file you want to import in the Import Text File dialog box
After you identify the file that holds the data you want to import, Excel launches the 
Text Import wizard.
Identify whether the data file has delimited or fixed-width fields
310
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
On the first page of the Text Import Wizard, you can indicate whether the data file 
you are importing is delimited or fixed-width; fixed-width means that each cell value 
will fall within a specific position in the file. After you choose the proper setting, which 
with contemporary data programs will almost always be Delimited, you can move to 
the next page of the wizard.
Identify the delimiter character and verify that your data appears to be separated correctly
On the second page, you can choose the delimiter for the file (for example, if Excel 
detected tabs in the file, it will select the Tab check box for you) and view a preview of 
what the text file will look like when imported. Clicking Next advances you to the final 
wizard page.
311
Create PivotTables from external data

You can identify the data types for your text file’s columns
On this page, you can change the data type and formatting of the columns in your 
data. Because you’ll assign formatting after you create the PivotTable, you can click 
Finish to import the data into your worksheet. After the data is in Excel, you can work 
with it normally.
To import data from a text file
1.	 Display the worksheet where you want the imported data to appear.
2.	 On the Data tab, in the Get External Data group, click From Text.
3.	 In the Import Text File dialog box, navigate to the folder that contains the file 
you want to import, click the file, and then click Import.
4.	 On the first page of the Text Import Wizard, verify that Delimited is selected, 
and then click Next.
312
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
5.	 On the second page of the Text Import Wizard, select the check box next to 
the file’s delimiter character, and then click Next.
6.	 If you want to identify data formats for individual columns, click the column in 
the Data preview area, and then use the options in the Column data format 
section of the wizard to set options for the column.
7.	 If necessary, repeat step 6 for additional columns.
8.	 Click Finish.
9.	 Using the tools in the Import Data dialog box, select a destination for the 
imported data, and then click OK.
To create a PivotTable from imported data
1.	 Click a cell in the imported data list.
2.	 On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, click PivotTable.
3.	 In the Create PivotTable dialog box, verify that Excel has correctly identified 
the data source you want to use.
4.	 Select the New Worksheet option button.
Or
Select the Existing Worksheet option button, click in the Location box, and 
click the cell where you want to the PivotTable to start.
5.	 Click OK.
Create dynamic charts by using PivotCharts
Just as you can create a PivotTable that you can reorganize whenever you want, to 
emphasize different aspects of the data in a list, you can also create a dynamic chart, 
or PivotChart, to reflect the contents and organization of a PivotTable.
313
Create dynamic charts by using PivotCharts

Define a PivotChart in the Create PivotChart dialog box
You can create a PivotTable and its associated PivotChart at the same time, or you can 
create a PivotChart from an existing PivotTable. If you create the PivotTable and Pivot­
Chart at the same time, blank outlines for each appear in your worksheet.
Creating a PivotChart also creates a PivotTable
314
Chapter 10: Create dynamic worksheets by using PivotTables

10
Any changes to the PivotTable on which the PivotChart is based are reflected in the 
PivotChart. For example, applying a PivotTable filter that limits the data displayed to 
values for the year 2014 focuses the chart on that data.
Summarize your data visually by using a PivotChart
You can also filter a PivotChart by using tools available in the body of the PivotChart, 
or change the PivotChart’s chart type to represent your data differently.
IMPORTANT  If your data is the wrong type to be represented by the chart type you 
select, Excel displays an error message.
To create a PivotTable and PivotChart at the same time
1.	 Click a cell in the Excel table or data list you want to summarize.
2.	 On the Insert tab, in the Charts group, click the PivotChart arrow.
3.	 In the PivotChart list, click PivotChart & PivotTable.
4.	 In the Create PivotTable dialog box, verify that Excel has correctly identified 
the data source you want to use.

instructions, see the introduction.
Microsoft Excel 2016 gives you a wide range of tools 
with which to create and manipulate your data. By using 
filters, by sorting, and by creating PivotTables and charts, 
you can change your worksheets so that they convey the 
greatest possible amount of information. After you con­
figure your worksheet so that it shows your data to best 
advantage, you can print your Excel documents to use in 
a presentation or include in a report. You can choose to 
print all or part of any of your worksheets, change how 
your data and charts appear on the printed page, and 
even suppress any error messages that might appear in 
your worksheets.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
preparing your worksheets for printing, printing all or 
part of a worksheet, printing charts, and adding headers 
and footers to your worksheets.
323

Add headers and footers to printed pages
If you want to ensure that the same information appears at the top or bottom of 
every printed page, you can do so by using headers or footers. A header is a section 
that appears at the top of every printed page; a footer is a section that appears at the 
bottom of every printed page. 
Headers and footers provide space to add information about your workbook
When you display your workbook’s headers and footers, Excel displays the workbook 
in Page Layout view. Page Layout view shows you exactly how your workbook will 
look when printed, while still enabling you to edit your file, a capability not provided 
by Print Preview. 
Excel divides its headers and footers into left, middle, and right sections. When you 
point to an editable header or footer section, Excel highlights the section to indicate 
that clicking will open that header or footer section for editing.
TIP  If you have a chart selected when you click the Header & Footer button on the 
Insert tab, Excel displays the Header/Footer page of the Page Setup dialog box instead 
of opening a header or footer section for editing.
324
Chapter 11: Print worksheets and charts

11
Excel generates headers based on your worksheet's properties
When you activate a header or footer section, you can add one of several standard 
headers and footers, such as page numbers by themselves or followed by the name of 
the workbook. The list of headers that appears will vary depending on the properties 
and contents of your worksheet and workbook.
You can also create custom headers by entering your own or adding a graphic, such 
as a company logo, to a worksheet. By adding graphics, you can identify the work­
sheet as referring to your company and help reinforce your company’s identity if you 
include the worksheet in a printed report distributed outside your company. After you 
insert a graphic into a header or footer, you can make it larger or smaller, change its 
appearance, or add borders.
When you print or display a worksheet, you might want to have different headers for 
odd and even pages, or perhaps just for the first page. After you indicate that you 
want separate headers, Excel indicates whether a header or footer applies to the first 
page or, if appropriate, an odd or even page.
325
Add headers and footers to printed pages

Your worksheet's header and footer will always be the same width as the printed 
worksheet, but you can adjust their vertical size.
Change header and footer heights in the Page Setup dialog box
To edit headers and footers
1.	 On the Insert tab of the ribbon, in the Text group, click Header & Footer.
2.	 Click in the header or footer section you want to edit.
To switch between the header and the footer

When you are ready to print your workbook, you can change the workbook’s proper­
ties to ensure that your worksheets display all your information and that printing is 
centered on the page. In Excel, all of these printing functions are gathered together in 
one place: the Backstage view. 
You can control most aspects of your printed worksheet
TIP  Press Ctrl+P to preview your worksheet in the Backstage view. 
You can change the number of copies to print, the printer to which you will send the 
file, whether Excel should print the page in landscape or portrait orientation, which 
paper size to use, which margin settings you want, and whether to scale the work­
sheet's contents so they fit on a specific number of printed pages.

Fit your worksheet contents to the printed page
Excel comes with three margin settings: Normal, Wide, and Narrow. Excel applies the 
Normal setting by default, but you can select any of the three options you want, or 
you can set your own custom margins.
You can control the white space, or margins, around your printed worksheet
A potential issue with printing worksheets is that the data in worksheets tends to be 
wider horizontally than a standard sheet of paper. If that’s the case, you can change 
the alignment of the rows and columns on the page. When the columns parallel the 
long edge of a piece of paper, the page is laid out in portrait mode; when the columns 
parallel the short edge of a piece of paper, it is in landscape mode. Changing between 
portrait and landscape mode might result in a better fit.
331
Prepare worksheets for printing

Select landscape or portrait mode for a better fit
If you can’t fit your worksheet contents on a single page by changing its orientation, 
you can change its scale. Scaling a worksheet for printing lets you specify the number 
of printed pages the worksheet will take up. You can scale your worksheet until 
every­thing fits on a specified number of printed pages, specify the number of printed 
pages the columns will appear on, or specify the number of printed pages the rows 
will appear on. If you have a list of data that’s 15 columns wide and 100 rows long, you 
could scale it so the columns all fit on each page of your printout.
When you look at your worksheet in the Backstage view, you can preview what it will 
look like when printed, including the number of pages it will be printed on.
TIP  When you display a workbook in the Backstage view, you can view the next printed 
page by pressing the Page Down key; to move to the previous page, press the Page Up 
key. You can also use the Previous and Next arrows at the bottom of the Backstage view, enter a 
page number in the Current Page box, or scroll through the pages by using the vertical scroll 
bar at the right edge of the Backstage view.

Prepare worksheets for printing

Change page breaks in a worksheet
Another way to affect how your worksheet will appear on the printed page is to 
change where Excel assigns its page breaks. A page break is the point at which Excel 
prints all subsequent data on a new sheet of paper. You can make these changes 
indirectly by modifying a worksheet’s margins, but you can also do so directly. You 
can view a worksheet in Page Break Preview mode by displaying the View tab of the 
ribbon and clicking the Page Break Preview button. In Page Break Preview mode, the 
blue lines in the window represent the page breaks. 
In Page Break Preview mode, page breaks appear in blue
IMPORTANT  If you want to insert a single page break (not both vertical and horizontal 
page breaks at the same point) in Page Break Preview mode, be sure to click a row 
header or column header. If you right-click a cell within the body of a worksheet in Page Break 
Preview mode and then click Insert Page Break, Excel creates both a vertical page break to the 
left of the selected cell and a horizontal page break above the selected cell.
334
Chapter 11: Print worksheets and charts

11
You can also move a page break by dragging it to its new position. Excel will change 
the worksheet’s properties so that the area you defined will be printed on a single 
page, if possible.
To add a page break to a worksheet
1.	 Click the row or column header where you want to add the page break.
2.	 On the Page Layout tab of the ribbon, in the Page Setup group, click the 
Breaks button, and then click Insert Page Break.
To remove a page break
1.	 Click the column header to the right of the page break.
Or
Click the row header below the page break.
2.	 In the Page Setup group, click the Breaks button, and then click Remove 
Page Break.
To reset all page breaks
1.	 Click the Breaks button, and then click Reset All Page Breaks.
Change the page printing order for worksheets
When you view a document in Page Break Preview mode, Excel indicates the order in 
which the pages will be printed with light gray words on the worksheet pages. (These 
indicators appear only in Page Break Preview mode; they don’t show up when the 
document is printed.) If you want, you can change the order in which the pages are 
printed. One reason to change the order in which Excel prints your worksheet pages 
would be to keep related information on consecutive pages.

Print worksheets
When you’re ready to print a worksheet, you can control how Excel prints it. For 
example, you can choose the printer to which you want to send this job, print multiple 
copies of the worksheet, and select whether the copies are collated (all pages of a 
document are printed together) or not (multiple copies of the same page are printed 
together). You can also print more than one worksheet at a time by selecting the 
worksheet tabs in the tab bar before you start printing, or you can have Excel print 
the entire workbook at once.
TIP  The worksheets you select for printing do not need to be next to one another in the 
workbook.
Control your print job from the Print page of the Backstage view
337
Print worksheets

Some worksheets you print might be works in progress, where some of the formulas 
might display errors due to missing values. You can select how Excel will print any 
errors in your worksheet: printing it as it normally appears in the worksheet, printing 
a blank cell in place of the error, or choosing one of two other indicators that are not 
standard error messages.
To print a worksheet in Excel
1.	 Display the worksheet you want to print.
2.	 In the left pane of the Backstage view, click Print.
Or
Press Ctrl+P.
3.	 Select the options you want to apply to the print job.

4.	 Click OK.
Print parts of worksheets
Excel gives you a great deal of control over what your worksheets look like when you 
print them, but you also have a lot of control over which parts of your worksheets will 
be printed. For example, you can choose which pages of a multipage worksheet you 
want to print. If you want to print a portion of a worksheet instead of the entire work­
sheet, you can define the area or areas you want to have printed and use the Center 
On Page controls on the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box to specify how 
Excel should position the area on the printed page.
TIP  You can include noncontiguous groups of cells in the area to be printed by holding 
down the Ctrl key as you select the cells.
339
Print parts of worksheets

Center printed items on the page horizontally and vertically
If the contents of a worksheet will take up more than one printed page, you can have 
Excel repeat one or more rows at the top of the page or columns at the left of the 
page. Repeating a row with headers makes the data easier to read throughout the 
printed document, because you and your colleagues won’t need to refer to the first 
page to know which data each row and column contains.
To print specific pages
1.	 Press Ctrl+P.
2.	 On the Print page of the Backstage view, in the first Pages box, enter the 
number of the first page you want to print.
3.	 In the second Pages box, enter the number of the last page you want to print.

Print charts
With charts, which are graphic representations of your Excel data, you can communi­
cate a lot of information with a single picture. Depending on your data and the type 
of chart you make, you can show trends across time, indicate the revenue share for 
various departments in a company for a month, or project future sales by using trend­
line analysis. After you create a chart, you can print it to include in a report or use in a 
presentation.
If you embed a chart in a worksheet, however, the chart will probably obscure some 
of your data unless you move the chart to a second page in the worksheet. That’s one 
way to handle printing a chart or the underlying worksheet, but there are other ways 
that don’t involve changing the layout of your worksheets.

a button

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the Excel2016SBS\Ch12 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
Many tasks you perform in Excel 2016, such as entering 
data or creating formulas, you do only once. However, 
there are probably one or two tasks you perform fre­
quently that require a lot of steps to accomplish. To save 
time, you can create a macro, which is a recorded series 
of actions, to perform the steps for you. After you have 
created a macro, you can run, edit, or delete it as needed.
You can make your macros easier to access by creating 
new buttons on the Quick Access Toolbar and assign­
ing your macros to them. If you run a macro to highlight 
specific cells in a worksheet every time you show that 
worksheet to a colleague, you can save time by adding a 
Quick Access Toolbar button that runs the macro to high­
light the cells for you. You can also create macros that run 
whenever you open the workbook that contains them, 
and you can add form controls, such as list boxes, to your 
worksheets to facilitate data entry.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to opening, running, creating, and modifying macros; 
creating Quick Access Toolbar buttons you can use to run 
macros with a single mouse click; defining macro security 
settings; running a macro when a workbook is opened; 
and inserting form controls into a worksheet.
349

Enable and examine macros
It’s possible for unscrupulous programmers to write viruses and other harmful programs 
by using the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language, so 
you need to be sure that you don’t run macros from unknown sources. In addition to 
running protective software such as Windows Defender, you can also change your Excel 
macro security settings to control when macros can be run. After you’re sure a macro is 
safe, you can open it in the Visual Basic Editor to examine its code.
Set macro security levels in Excel 2016
In versions of Excel prior to Excel 2007, you could define macro security levels to 
determine which macros, if any, your workbooks would be allowed to run, but there 
was no workbook type in which all macros were disallowed. Excel 2016 has several file 
types you can use to control whether a workbook will allow macros to run. The fol­
lowing table summarizes the macro-related file types.
Extension
Description
.xlsx
Regular Excel 2016 workbook; macros are disabled
.xlsm
Regular Excel 2016 workbook; macros are enabled
.xltx
Excel 2016 template workbook; macros are disabled
.xltm
Excel 2016 template workbook; macros are enabled
When you open a macro-enabled workbook, the Excel app-level security settings 
might prevent the workbook from running the macro code. When that happens, 
Excel displays a security warning on the message bar.
350
Chapter 12: Automate repetitive tasks by using macros

12
Macro security settings help reduce outside threats
Clicking the Enable Content button lets the workbook use its macros. Always take the 
time to verify the workbook’s source and consider whether you expected the work­
book to contain macros before you enable the content. If you decide not to enable 
the macros in a workbook, close the message bar without enabling the content. You 
will still be able to edit the workbook, but macros and other active content will not be 
available.
You can change your app-level security settings to make them more or less restrictive 
by using the Trust Center dialog box.
351
Enable and examine macros

Define macro security settings in the Trust Center
The Excel default macro security level is Disable All Macros With Notification, which 
means that Excel displays a warning on the message bar but allows you to enable 
the macros manually. Selecting the Disable All Macros Without Notification option 
does exactly what the label says. If you work in an environment where your work­
books contain macros verified with digital signatures, you could select the Disable All 
Macros Except Digitally Signed Macros option.
IMPORTANT  Because it is possible to write macros that act as viruses, potentially 
causing harm to your computer and spreading copies of themselves to other computers, 
you should never choose the Enable All Macros security setting, even if you have virus-checking 
software installed on your computer.
To change macro security settings
1.	 Display the Backstage view, and then click Options. 
2.	 In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Trust Center category.
3.	 Click Trust Center Settings.
4.	 Click Macro Settings.
352

5.	 Select one of the following security levels:
●
●
Disable all macros without notification
●
●
Disable all macros with notification
●
●
Disable all macros except digitally signed macros
●
●
Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)
6.	 Click OK twice.
Examine macros
One great way to get an idea of how macros work is to examine an existing macro. 
The Macro dialog box displays a list of macros in your workbook by default, but you 
can also choose to display the macros available in other workbooks. When you display 
a macro’s code, Excel opens it in the Visual Basic Editor.
View and edit macros in the Visual Basic Editor
353
Enable and examine macros

TIP  You can also open and close the Visual Basic Editor by pressing Alt+F11. 
Consider, for example, the code for a macro that selects the cell range C4:C9 and 
changes the cells’ formatting to bold. The first line of the macro identifies the cell 
range to be selected (in this case, cells C4:C9). After the macro selects the cells, the 
next line of the macro changes the formatting of the selected cells to bold, which has 
the same result as clicking a cell and then clicking the Bold button in the Font group 
on the Home tab.
You can move through a macro one step at a time to observe how the code executes, 
run the macro to a breakpoint, or run the macro the whole way through.
TIP  To execute an instruction, press F8. The highlight moves to the next instruction, 
and your worksheet then changes to reflect the action that resulted from executing 
the preceding instruction.
Step through a macro one instruction at a time
354

You can run a macro without stopping from within the Macro dialog box. You’ll 
usually run the macro this way; after all, the point of using macros is to save time.
TIP  To open the Macro dialog box by using a keyboard shortcut, press Alt+F8. 
To examine a macro
1.	 On the View tab of the ribbon, in the Macros group, click the Macros button.
2.	 In the Macro dialog box, click the macro you want to examine.
3.	 Click Edit.
4.	 Make any changes you want to the macro’s code.
5.	 In the Visual Basic Editor, click File, and then click Close and Return to 
Microsoft Excel.
To move through a macro one step at a time
1.	 Click the Macros button.
2.	 In the Macro dialog box, click the macro you want to step through.
3.	 Click Step Into.
4.	 In the Visual Basic Editor, press F8 to execute the highlighted step.
5.	 Do one of the following:
●
●
Repeat step 4 until you have moved through the entire macro.
●
●
Press F5 to run the remaining steps without stopping.
●
●
On the Visual Basic Editor toolbar, click the Reset button to stop stepping 
through the macro.
6.	 In the Visual Basic Editor, click File, and then click Close and Return to 
Microsoft Excel.
355
Enable and examine macros

Create and modify macros
The first step in creating a macro is to plan the process you want to automate. Com­
puters today are quite fast, so adding an extra step during recording doesn’t slow 
you down noticeably, but leaving out a step means that you will need to re-record 
your macro. After you plan your process, you can record your macro by using the 
tools in the Record Macro dialog box.
Automate repeatable processes by using the Record Macro dialog box to create a macro
After you give your macro a name and description, you can record your actions. To 
modify an existing macro, you can simply delete the macro and re-record it. Or, if you 
just need to make a quick change, you can open it in the Visual Basic Editor and add 
to or change the macro’s instructions. 
TIP  For more information about using the Visual Basic Editor, press Alt+F11 to display 
the Visual Basic Editor, press F1 to display the Context Help dialog box, click VBA, and 
then click Help to display the Visual Basic Help dialog box.

2.	 Click the macro you want to edit.
3.	 Click Edit.
4.	 Make the changes you want to make to your macro’s code.
5.	 Press Ctrl+S to save your changes.
6.	 In the Visual Basic Editor, click File, and then click Close and Return to 
Microsoft Excel.
To delete a macro
1.	 Click the Macros button.
2.	 Click the macro you want to delete.
3.	 Click Delete.
4.	 In the confirmation dialog box that appears, click Yes.
Run macros when you click a button
You can use the ribbon to quickly access the commands built into Excel. However, it 
can take a few seconds to open the Macro dialog box. When you’re in the middle of a 
presentation, taking even those few seconds can reduce your momentum and force 
you to regain your audience’s attention. 
357
Run macros when you click a button

If you want to run a macro without having to display the Macro dialog box, you can 
do so by adding a button representing the macro to the Quick Access Toolbar. Click­
ing that button runs the macro immediately, which is very handy when you create a 
macro for a task you perform frequently. 
If you want to add more than one macro button to the Quick Access Toolbar, or if you 
want to change the button that represents your macro on the Quick Access Toolbar, 
you can select a new button from more than 160 options. 
Change the appearance of buttons on your Quick Access Toolbar
Finally, you can have Excel run a macro when you click a shape in your workbook. By 
using this technique, you can create “buttons” that are graphically richer than those 
available on the Quick Access Toolbar. If you want, you can even create custom button 
layouts that represent other objects, such as a remote control. 
IMPORTANT  When you assign a macro to run when you click a shape, don’t change 
the name of the macro that appears in the Assign Macro dialog box. The name that 
appears refers to the object and what the object should do when it is clicked; changing the 
macro name breaks that connection and prevents Excel from running the macro.

Run a macro when you open a workbook 
One advantage of writing Excel macros in VBA is that you can have Excel run a macro 
whenever you open a workbook. For example, if you use a worksheet for presenta­
tions, you can create macros that render the contents of selected cells in bold type, 
italic, or different typefaces to set the data apart from data in neighboring cells. If you 
close a workbook without removing that formatting, however, the contents of your 
workbook will still have that formatting applied the next time you open it. Although 
this change might not be a catastrophe, returning the workbook to its original for­
matting might take some time to accomplish.
Instead of running a macro manually, or even from a toolbar button or a menu, you 
can have Excel run a macro whenever you open a workbook. The trick of making that 
happen is in the name you give the macro. When Excel finds a macro with the name 
Auto_Open, it runs the macro when the workbook to which it is attached is opened.
TIP  If you have your macro security set to the Disable All Macros With Notification 
level, you can click the Options button that appears on the message bar, select the 
Enable This Content option, and then click OK to allow the Auto_Open macro to run.
To run a macro when you open a workbook 
1.	 On the View tab, in the Macros group, click the Macros button.
2.	 Click the macro you want to run when the workbook is opened.
3.	 Click Edit.
4.	 Edit the Sub MacroName() line so it reads Sub Auto_Open().
5.	 Press Ctrl+S to save your changes.
6.	 In the Visual Basic Editor, click File, and then click Close and Return to 
Microsoft Excel.
Or
1.	 Click the Macros arrow (not the button), and then click Record Macro.
2.	 In the Macro name box, enter Auto_Open.
3.	 Click OK.
4.	 Record the steps you want Excel to execute when the workbook is opened.
5.	 Click the Macros arrow (not the button), and then click Stop Recording.

Insert form controls into a worksheet
When you summarize data in an Excel workbook, you can change the values used in 
your visualizations in many different ways. Some of those methods include creating 
filters, sorting your data, or entering new values into a cell to change the result of a 
formula or filter. You can enhance those capabilities by adding form controls to your 
worksheets, a process you start by displaying the Developer tab of the ribbon.
Manage macros and other advanced elements by using the options on the Developer tab
A form control provides additional interactivity that you can use to change your 
worksheet quickly and visually.
TIP  The form controls described in this chapter mimic controls such as list boxes, check 
boxes, and option buttons that are available in many Excel dialog boxes.
Two form controls, the list box and the combo box, display a list of values from a cell 
range you define. The difference between the list box and the combo box is that a list 
box displays all of its values at the same time, and a combo box has an arrow you can 
click to display the values from which you can choose.
Select values by using list boxes and combo boxes
After you add a combo box or list box to your worksheet, you can use the settings in 
the Format Control dialog box to identify the cells that provide values for the control, 
the cell that displays the control’s value, and many other properties on the other tabs 
of the dialog box.
362
Chapter 12: Automate repetitive tasks by using macros

12
Set form control parameters by using the Format Control dialog box
TIP  The cells that provide values for your list box or combo box don’t have to be on the 
same worksheet as the form control. Putting the values on another worksheet lets you 
reduce the clutter in the worksheet that contains the visualization. Hiding the worksheet that 
contains the source data also helps prevent users from changing those values.
Another form control, the spin button, lets you change numerical values in incre­
ments. For example, you could use spin buttons to increase or decrease the pounds 
and ounces representing a package’s weight.

363
Insert form controls into a worksheet

Spin buttons are effective presentation tools. With a series of mouse clicks, you can 
change a value up or down in increments you define, illustrating how your work­
sheet’s results change.
Spin buttons use slightly different parameters than combo boxes or list boxes. Rather 
than identifying the cell range that provides values for the control, you specify the 
maximum value, minimum value, increment (amount the value changes with each 
mouse click), and which worksheet cell displays the spin button’s value.
Change a spin button’s values in the Format Control dialog box
IMPORTANT  The maximum, minimum, and increment values must be whole numbers. 
If you want to use a spin button to change a percentage, for example, you’ll need to 
create a formula in another cell that divides the spin button’s value by 100.
The button form control, also referred to as a command button, runs a macro when 
it’s clicked. When you add a button to a worksheet, the Assign Macro dialog box 
appears so you can tell it which macro to run.
364
Chapter 12: Automate repetitive tasks by using macros

12
The Assign Macro dialog box for a newly created command button
The next two form controls, the check box and option button, both let users turn 
­particular options on or off. For example, a package delivery company could allow 
customers to waive a signature when a package is dropped off. If the Signature 
required option button (the first option button in the group) is selected, the cell 
­displaying the option button’s value would contain the number 1. If the Signature 
waived option button is selected, the cell would contain the number 2.
Option button groups let the user select one of several values
365
Insert form controls into a worksheet

TIP  Even though the check box and option button serve the same purpose, you should 
consider using both types of controls to distinguish among different sets of options. 
You can have a cell display whether a check box or option button is selected, or define 
a control group that contains the possible options. 
TIP  Control groups can contain either option buttons or check boxes, but you can’t mix 
them in the same group.
After you add your controls to your worksheet, you can move, align, edit, and delete 
them, just as you can with other shapes. One important element to edit is the con­
trol’s caption, or label, which indicates the type of value the control represents. For 
example, an option button could have the label Signature required, indicating that 
selecting that option requires the delivery person to have the recipient sign for the 
package.

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the Excel2016SBS\Ch13 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
By itself, Excel 2016 provides a broad range of tools so 
that you can store, present, and summarize your data. 
When you use other Microsoft Office 2016 apps, you can 
extend your capabilities even further. For example, you 
can include a file created with another Office app in an 
Excel workbook. If you use Microsoft Word 2016 to write 
a quick note about why a customer’s shipping expendi­
tures decreased significantly in January, you can include 
the report in your workbook. Similarly, you can include 
your Excel workbooks in documents created with other 
Office apps. If you want to copy only part of a workbook, 
such as a chart, to another Office document, you can also 
do that.
Excel integrates well with the web. If you know of a web-
based resource that would be useful to someone who is 
viewing a document, you can create a hyperlink, which is 
a connection from one place in a document to a place in 
the same file, or to another file anywhere on a network or 
on the Internet, as long as the user’s computer can reach 
that location.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to including an Office 2016 document in a workbook, 
­storing an Excel workbook as part of another Office 
document, creating hyperlinks, and pasting an Excel 
chart into another document.
373

Include Office documents in workbooks 
and other files
One benefit of working with Excel 2016 is that because it is part of Office 2016, you 
can combine data from Excel and other Office apps to create informative documents 
and presentations. Just as you do when you combine data from more than one Excel 
document, when you combine information from another Office file with an Excel 
workbook, you can either embed the other Office document into the Excel workbook 
or create a link between the workbook and the other document.
Embed an Excel workbook in another Office file
When you link to an Office file from within Excel, any changes made to the Office file 
will appear in your Excel workbook.
Chapter 13: Work with other Microsoft Office apps
374

13
Link to other Office documents from Excel
Link Office documents to Excel workbooks
There are two advantages to creating a link between your Excel workbook and the 
other file. The first benefit is that linking to the other file, as opposed to copying the 
entire file into your workbook, keeps your Excel workbook small. If the workbook is 
copied to another drive or computer, you can maintain the link by copying the linked 
file along with the Excel workbook or by re-creating the link if the linked file is on 
the same network as the Excel workbook. It is also possible to use the workbook if 
the linked file isn’t available. The second benefit of linking to another file is that any 
changes in the file to which you link are reflected in your Excel workbook.
You create a link between an Excel workbook and another Office document by iden­
tifying the file, specifying how to connect to it, and choosing how to display the file 
within your workbook. After you’ve defined this connection, you can still edit the file 
by opening it from within Excel or in the app used to create it.
Include Office documents in workbooks and other files
375

Identify the file to include in your workbook by using the Object dialog box
TIP  The upper-left corner of the linked or embedded file, or the icon that represents 
the file, appears in the worksheet’s active cell.
To create a link to an Office document
1.	 On the Insert tab of the ribbon, in the Text group, click Object to open the 
Object dialog box.
2.	 Click the Create from File tab to display the Create From File page.
3.	 Click Browse to open the Browse dialog box.
4.	 Browse to the directory that contains the file you want to insert, select it in the 
file list, and then click Insert. 
5.	 Select the Link to file check box, and then click OK to create a link from your 
workbook to the presentation.
Chapter 13: Work with other Microsoft Office apps
376

13
To edit a file from its link in an Excel workbook
1.	 Right-click the linked file in your Excel workbook, point to ObjectType, and 
click Edit.
2.	 Edit the file in the other Office app, then save and close the file.
Embed files in Excel and other Office apps
The preceding section described how to link to another file from within your Excel 
workbook. The advantages of linking to a second file are that the size of your work­
book is kept small, and any changes in the second document will be reflected in your 
workbook. The disadvantage is that the second document must be copied with the 
workbook—or it must at least be on a network-accessible computer. If Excel can’t find 
or access the second file where the link says it is located, Excel can’t display it. You can 
still open your workbook, but you won’t be able to view the linked file’s contents.
If file size isn’t an issue and you want to ensure that the second document is always 
available, you can embed the file in your workbook. Embedding another file in an 
Excel workbook means that the entirety of the other file is saved as part of your 
workbook. Wherever your workbook goes, the embedded file goes along with it. Of 
course, the embedded version of the file is no longer connected to the original file, so 
changes in one aren’t reflected in the other.
IMPORTANT  To view a linked or embedded file, you must have the app used to create 
it installed on the computer on which you open the workbook.
If you don’t want your workbook to take up much room in the file where you embed 
it, you can have the other app display the workbook as an icon to save space. As with 
a linked file, you can always edit your workbook in Excel.
Similarly, you can also embed an Excel workbook in another Office file. This is done 
from the Insert Object dialog box in the other Office file. In this dialog box, if the 
Link check box is cleared, the Excel workbook will be embedded. If that check box is 
selected, you will create a link to the Excel workbook instead of embedding it.

Embed Excel files in Microsoft PowerPoint and Word documents
Create hyperlinks
One of the characteristics of the web is that documents published on webpages can 
have references, or hyperlinks, that you can click to display them. In Excel, you can 
also create hyperlinks that connect to locations in the same document or to other 
web documents. A hyperlink functions much like a link between two cells or between 
two files, but hyperlinks can reach any computer on the Internet, not just those on a 
corporate network. Hyperlinks that haven’t been clicked usually appear as underlined 
blue text, and hyperlinks that have been followed appear as underlined purple text, 
but you can change those settings.
Create hyperlinks
379

Add resources to your workbook by using hyperlinks
You can choose exactly what kind of hyperlink you want to create and specify the text 
you want to represent it in your workbook.
Create a link to an existing file or webpage
You can choose one of four types of targets, or destinations, for your hyperlink: an 
existing file or webpage, a place in the current document, a new document you create 
on the spot, or an email address. Creating a mailto hyperlink, which is the technical 
term for a hyperlink that creates an email message, also lets you specify a subject 
for messages generated by clicking the link. Regardless of the type of hyperlink you 
create, you can change the text that appears in your worksheet, edit the hyperlink, or 
remove it at any time.

Paste charts into documents
One more way to include objects from a workbook in another Office document is 
to copy the object you want to share and then paste it into its new location. You can 
copy Excel charts to Word documents and PowerPoint presentations directly, which 
lets the chart update whenever the data in the source workbook changes. You can 
also copy the chart’s current appearance as an image. Doing so doesn’t create a link 
to the original data, but it does provide an accurate picture of the chart’s appearance 
when you captured the image.
IMPORTANT  If you create a link to an Excel chart, the Excel workbook must keep the 
same relationship with the file as when you linked the chart. If the workbook and other 
Office file are in the same folder, they must remain in the same folder. If the workbook is on a 
networked computer, it must remain in its original folder so the link path remains the same.
To paste a chart into an Office document, preserving a link to the original 
workbook 
1.	 In Excel, right-click the chart and click Copy.
2.	 Display the Office file in which you want to paste the chart, and press Ctrl+V.

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the Excel2016SBS\Ch14 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
Many individuals have input into business decisions. You 
and your colleagues can enhance the Excel 2016 work­
book data you share by adding comments that offer 
insight into the information the data represents. If the 
workbook in which those projections and comments are 
stored is available on a network or an intranet, you can 
allow more than one user to access the workbook at a 
time by turning on workbook sharing, and you can track 
changes.
If you prefer to limit the number of colleagues who can 
view and edit your workbooks, you can add password 
protection to a workbook, worksheet, cell range, or even 
an individual cell. You can also hide formulas used to cal­
culate values. If you work in an environment in which you 
exchange files frequently, you can use a digital signature 
to help verify that your workbooks and any macros they 
contain are from a trusted source. Finally, if you want to 
display information on a website, you can do so by saving 
a workbook as a webpage. 
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
sharing a workbook, saving workbooks for electronic 
distribution and for the web, managing comments in 
workbook cells, tracking and managing colleagues’ 
changes, adding protection to workbooks and work­
sheets, finalizing and authenticating workbooks, 
importing and exporting XML data, and working with 
OneDrive and Excel Online.

Share workbooks
If you want several users to be able to edit a workbook simultaneously, you must turn 
on workbook sharing. Workbook sharing works well for businesses where multiple 
users might require access to a file at the same time. When you share a workbook, you 
can set the sharing options to maintain a change history and manage which changes 
take priority.
Define how Excel should manage your shared workbook
IMPORTANT  You can’t share a workbook that contains an Excel table. If you do want 
to share a workbook that contains an Excel table, convert the Excel table to a regular 
cell range.
390
Chapter 14: Collaborate with colleagues

14
On the Advanced page of the Share Workbook dialog box, two settings are of partic­
ular interest. The first determines whether Excel should maintain a history of changes 
made to the workbook and, if so, for how many days it should keep the history. The 
default setting is for the app to retain a record of all changes made in the past 30 
days, but you can enter any number of days you want. If you revisit your workbook on 
a regular basis, maintaining a list of all changes for the past 180 days might be reason­
able. For a workbook that changes less frequently, a history reaching back 365 days 
(one year) could meet your tracking and auditing needs. Excel rejects and deletes the 
record of any changes made earlier than the time you set.
TIP  You should find out whether your organization has an information retention 
policy that would affect the amount of time you should keep your workbooks’ 
change histories.
The other important setting on this page deals with how Excel decides which of two 
conflicting changes in a cell should be applied. You can have the most recent changes 
win or have Excel let you review the changes to indicate which ones to keep.
When you share a workbook, you and your colleagues can turn off change tracking 
and have Excel stop noting changes to the file. You can, if you want, require a pass­
word to turn off change tracking in a shared workbook.
There are two main ways to share a workbook with your colleagues: you can make it 
available over your organization’s network, or you can send a copy of the file to your 
colleagues via email. Every organization’s network is different, so you should check 
with your network administrators to determine the best way to share a file. Although 
the specific command to attach a file to an email message is different in every email 
app, the most common method of attaching a file is to create a new email message 
and then click the Attach button, as in Microsoft Outlook 2016.
To share a workbook
1.	 On the Review tab of the ribbon, in the Changes group, click Share Workbook.
2.	 On the Editing tab of the Share Workbook dialog box, select the Allow

Save workbooks for electronic distribution
Even though most businesses use Excel, there might be times when you want to dis­
tribute a copy of your data in a file other than an Excel workbook. You can create a 
read-only copy of a workbook for electronic distribution by saving it as a PDF or XML 
Paper Specification (XPS) file. 
Export a workbook as a PDF or XPS file
Publishing your workbook as a PDF or XPS document gives your colleagues the infor­
mation they need to make decisions in an easily readable format that also preserves 
the integrity of your data.
TIP  You can also save a workbook as a PDF or XPS document by clicking Save As in the 
Backstage view. Then, in the Save As dialog box, in the Save As Type list, select either 
PDF or XPS to create a file of the type you want.
To export a workbook as a PDF or XPS file
1.	 Display the Backstage view, and then click Export.
2.	 If necessary, click Create PDF/XPS Document, and then click Create PDF/XPS.

to minimize file size for online-only publishing.
7.	 Click Publish.
Manage comments
Excel makes it easy for you and your colleagues to insert comments in workbook 
cells, adding insights that go beyond the cell data. When you add a comment to a 
cell, a flag appears in the upper-right corner of the cell. When you point to a cell that 
contains a comment, the comment appears in a box next to the cell, along with the 
user name of the user who was logged on to the computer on which the comment 
was created.
An Excel worksheet with a comment in cell D4
IMPORTANT  Note that the name attributed to a comment might not be the same as 
the name of the person who actually created it. Access controls, such as those that 
require users to enter account names and passwords when they access a computer, can help 
track the person who made a comment or change.
Normally, Excel only displays a cell’s comment when you point to the cell. You can 
change that behavior to display an individual comment or to show all comments 
within a worksheet. If you want to edit a comment, you can do so, or you can delete 
a comment from your workbook.
395
Manage comments

Manage comments by using the tools on the Review tab of the ribbon
IMPORTANT  When someone other than the original user edits a comment, that person’s 
input is marked with the new user’s name and is added to the original comment.
You can control whether a cell displays just the comment indicator or the indicator and 
the comment itself. Also, if you’ve just begun to review a worksheet, you can display 
all of the comments on the sheet or move through them one at a time.
To add a comment to a cell
1.	 Click the cell where you want to add a comment.
2.	 On the Review tab of the ribbon, in the Comments group, click New Comment.
Or
Right-click the cell, and then click Insert Comment.
3.	 In the comment box that appears, enter a comment.
4.	 Click away from the cell to close the comment box.

Track and manage colleagues’ changes
Whenever you collaborate with your colleagues to produce or edit a document, you 
should consider tracking the changes each user makes. When you turn on change 
tracking, any changes made to the workbook are highlighted in a color assigned to 
the user who made the changes. One benefit of tracking changes is that if you have a 
question about a change, you can quickly identify who made the change and verify 
that it is correct. 
Turn on change tracking in the Highlight Changes dialog box
398
Chapter 14: Collaborate with colleagues

14
TIP  Selecting the When check box and choosing the All option has the same effect as 
clearing the check box.
You can use the commands in the Highlight Changes dialog box to choose which 
changes to track. Most commonly you will have Excel track all changes, but you can 
also specify a time frame, users, or areas of the workbook to limit which changes are 
highlighted. Each user’s changes are displayed in a unique color. When you point to 
a cell that contains a change, the date and time when the change was made and the 
name of the user who made it appear as a ScreenTip.
Point to a cell with a tracked change to see a summary of the change
After you and your colleagues finish modifying a workbook, anyone with permission to 
open the workbook can decide which changes to accept and which changes to reject. 
You can select which changes to review and then accept or reject individual changes. 
Review individual changes in your workbook

Add protection to workbooks and 
worksheets
You can use Excel to share your workbooks on the web, on a corporate intranet, or by 
copying files for other users to take on business trips. An important part of sharing 
files, however, is ensuring that only those users you want to have access to the files 
can open or modify them. It doesn’t help a company to have unauthorized personnel, 
even those with good intentions, accessing critical workbooks.
You can limit access to your workbooks or elements within workbooks by setting 
passwords. When you set a password for an Excel workbook, any users who want to 
access the protected workbook must enter the workbook’s password in a dialog box 
that opens when they try to open the file. If users don’t know the password, they cannot 
open the workbook.
401
Add protection to workbooks and worksheets

Encrypt a workbook by setting a password to open the file
To remove the passwords from a workbook, repeat these steps, but delete the pass­
words rather than setting them.
TIP  The best passwords are long strings of random characters, but random charac-
ters are hard to remember. One reasonable method of creating hard-to-guess pass­
words is to string two or more words and a number together. For example, the password 
genuinestarcalibration302 is 24 characters long, combines letters and numbers, and is easy 
to remember. If you must create a shorter password to meet a system’s constraints, avoid 
dictionary words and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and any special 
symbols such as ! or # if they are allowed.
If you want to allow anyone to open a workbook but want to prevent unauthorized 
users from editing a worksheet, you can protect an individual worksheet. You can also 
set a password that a user must type in before protection can be turned off, and choose 
which elements of the worksheet a user can change while protection is turned on.
402
Chapter 14: Collaborate with colleagues

14
Limit the worksheet elements that a user can edit without a password
The check box at the top of the list of allowed actions in the Protect Sheet dialog 
box mentions locked cells. A locked cell is a cell that can’t be changed when work­
sheet protection is turned on. You can lock or unlock a cell by changing the cell’s 
formatting. When worksheet protection is turned on, selecting the Locked check box 
prevents unauthorized users from changing the contents or formatting of the locked 
cell, whereas selecting the Hidden check box hides the formulas in the cell. You might 
want to hide the formula in a cell if you draw sensitive data, such as customer contact 
information, from another workbook and don’t want casual users to see the name of 
the workbook in a formula.
Finally, you can password-protect a cell range. For example, you might want to let users 
enter values in most worksheet cells but also want to protect the cells with formulas that 
perform calculations based on those values.

Finalize workbooks
Distributing a workbook to other users carries many risks, not the least of which is the 
possibility that the workbook might contain private information you don’t want to 
share with users outside your organization. With Excel, you can inspect a workbook for 
information you might not want to distribute to other people, and create a read-only 
final version that prevents other people from making changes to the workbook content.
By using the Document Inspector, you can quickly locate comments and annotations, 
document properties and personal information, custom XML data, headers and footers, 
hidden rows and columns, hidden worksheets, and invisible content. You can then 
easily remove any hidden or personal information that the Document Inspector finds.
Check for personally identifiable information by using the Document Inspector
408
Chapter 14: Collaborate with colleagues

14
The Document Inspector checks your document for every category of information 
that is selected in the list. When the Document Inspector displays its results, you can 
select which pieces of personally identifiable information you want to remove.
When you’re done making changes to a workbook, you can mark it as final. Marking 
a workbook as final sets the status property to Final and turns off data entry and edit­
ing commands. If you later decide that you want to make more changes, you can do 
so, save your changes, and mark the worksheet final again.
To remove personally identifiable information from a workbook 
1.	 Press Ctrl+S to save the workbook.
2.	 Display the Backstage view and, if necessary, click Info.
3.	 Click Check for Issues, and then click Inspect Document.
4.	 Select the check box next to each category of information you want the 
Document Inspector to look for.
5.	 Click Inspect.
6.	 In the results list, click the Remove All button next to any category of 
information you want to remove.
7.	 If necessary, click Reinspect and then click Inspect to ensure that no personal 
information remains in the file.
8.	 Click Close.
To mark a workbook as final

Authenticate workbooks
The unfortunate reality of exchanging files over networks, especially over the Internet, is 
that you need to be sure you know the origin of the files you’re working with. One way 
an organization can guard against files with viruses or substitute data is to authenticate 
every workbook by using a digital signature. A digital signature is a character string cre­
ated by combining a user’s unique digital certificate mathematically with the contents 
of the workbook, which apps such as Excel can recognize and use to verify the identity 
of the user who signed the file. A good analogy for a digital signature is a wax seal, 
which was used for thousands of years to verify the integrity and origin of a document.
The technical details of and procedure for managing digital certificates are beyond 
the scope of this book, but your network administrator should be able to create or 
obtain a digital certificate for you. You can also directly purchase a digital signature 
from a third party; these signatures can usually be renewed annually for a small fee. 
For the purposes of this book, you can use the selfcert.exe Microsoft Office accessory 
app to generate a certificate with which to perform this topic’s practice task at the 
end of this chapter. This type of certificate is useful for certifying a document as part 
of a demonstration, but other users might not accept it as a valid certificate.
TIP  When you click Add A Digital Signature in the Protect Workbook list on the Info 
page of the Backstage view, Excel checks your computer for usable digital certificates. If 
it can’t find one, Excel displays a dialog box indicating that you can buy digital signatures from 
third-party providers. You won’t be able to add a digital signature to a file until you acquire a 
digital certificate, either by generating a test certificate using the included selfcert.exe app or 
by purchasing one through a third-party vendor.
If you have several certificates from which to choose, and the certificate you want 
doesn’t appear when you attempt to sign your file, you can change the chosen certifi­
cate and start the signing process again.
IMPORTANT  Editing a workbook that has a digital signature invalidates the signature. 
To verify the file, you must sign it again.

Save workbooks for the web
You can use Excel to save your workbooks as web documents so that you and your 
colleagues can view workbooks over the Internet or on an organization’s intranet. 
For a document to be viewable on the web, it must be saved as an HTML file. HTML 
files, which end with either the .htm or the .html extension, include tags that tell a web 
browser such as Microsoft Edge how to display the contents of the file.
For example, you might want to set the data labels in a workbook apart from the rest of 
the data by having the labels displayed with bold text. The coding in an HTML file that 
indicates text to be displayed as bold text is <b>...</b>, where the ellipsis between the 
tags is replaced by the text to be displayed. So the following HTML fragment would be 
displayed as Excel in a webpage.
<b>Excel</b>
TIP  If the only sheet in your workbook that contains data is the one displayed when you 
save the workbook as a webpage, Excel only saves that worksheet as a webpage.
412
Chapter 14: Collaborate with colleagues

14
After you save an Excel workbook as a set of HTML documents, you can open it in 
your web browser. It’s also possible to save a workbook as a web file that retains a link 
to the original workbook. Whenever someone updates the workbook, Excel updates 
the web files to reflect the new content.
Select which elements of a workbook to publish to the web
You can select which elements of your workbook to publish to the web in the Pub­
lish As Web Page dialog box. Clicking the Choose arrow displays a list of publishable 
items, including the option to publish the entire workbook, items on specific sheets, 
or a range of cells. You can also specify which text appears on the webpage’s title bar. 
To save a workbook as a web file
1.	 Display the Backstage view, and then click Save As.
2.	 Click Browse.
3.	 In the Save As dialog box, click the Save as type arrow, and then click Web Page.
4.	 If necessary, in the File name box, edit the name of the file.
5.	 Click Save.
6.	 If necessary, in the dialog box that appears, click Yes to acknowledge that some 
features might be lost when you save the workbook as a webpage.

Import and export XML data
HTML lets you determine how a document will be displayed in a web browser—for 
example, by telling Internet Explorer to display certain text in bold type or to start a 
new paragraph. However, HTML doesn’t tell you anything about the meaning of data 
in a document. Internet Explorer might “know” it should display a set of data in a table, 
but it wouldn’t “know” that the data represented an Excel worksheet.
You can add metadata, or data about data, to web documents by using Extensible 
Markup Language (XML). Though a full discussion of XML is beyond the scope of this 
book, the following bit of XML code shows how you might identify two sets of three 
values (Month, Category, and Exceptions) by using XML.
414
Chapter 14: Collaborate with colleagues

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:exceptions xmlns:ns2="http://www.w3schools.com">
<exception>
  <Month>January</Month>
  <Category>2Day</Category>
  <Exceptions>14</Exceptions>
</exception>
<exception>
  <Month>January</Month>
  <Category>3Day</Category>
  <Exceptions>3</Exceptions>
</exception>
</ns2:exceptions>
XML is meant to be a universal language, allowing data to move freely from one app 
to another. Excel might display those two sets of exceptions data as rows of data in an 
Excel worksheet.
Data imported from an XML file can be displayed in an Excel worksheet
Other apps could display or process the XML file’s contents in other ways, but you 
wouldn’t have to change the underlying XML file. All of the work is done by the other 
apps’ programmers. To work with XML data in Excel, you must use the controls on the 
Developer ribbon tab, which you can display by using the ribbon customization com­
mands available in the Excel Options dialog box.
415
Import and export XML data

Display the Developer tab on the ribbon from the Excel Options dialog box
You can bring XML data into Excel, either by opening a workbook saved in a compatible 
XML format or by importing the data from a text file. XML data is organized according 
to a specified schema, or structure. If the schema file isn’t available, you can have Excel 
look at the structure of the imported data and create one for you. If you export a work­
sheet to an XML file, you can have Excel create a schema for that operation, too.
TIP  If you have imported an XML file but believe that the original XML data file has 
changed, click the Refresh Data button in the XML group on the Developer tab to 
update your worksheet.

folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
Organizations of all kinds generate and collect data from 
operations, sales, and customers. As the volume of data 
grows, so does the importance of generating useful 
insights into your operations from that data. Excel sup­
ports business intelligence analysis, which is the practice 
of examining data to improve business performance. 
Analytical tools such as formulas, data tables, and Pivot­
Tables all provide valuable insights into your data, but 
their applications can be limited in size and scope.
Excel 2016 includes many advanced data analysis capabili­
ties that were previously exclusive to enterprise customers. 
One technology underlying the new tools is the Excel Data 
Model, which you can use to create relationships among 
Excel tables in your workbooks. Add to this the ability to 
import and analyze large data sets by using Power Query 
and Power Pivot, and Excel 2016 puts significant data 
analysis capabilities at your fingertips.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
enabling the Data Analysis add-ins and adding tables 
to the Data Model, defining relationships between 
tables, analyzing data by using Power Pivot, viewing 
data by using timelines, and bringing in external data 
by using Power Query.
IMPORTANT  The tools and techniques described in 
this chapter will only be available to you after you 
enable the Data Analysis add-ins.
431

Enable the Data Analysis add-ins
One of the great new additions to Excel 2016 is the collection of Data Analysis add-ins 
you can use to perform advanced analysis on your data. These tools build on the Excel 
Data Model, which manages Excel tables, Query tables, and other data sources, as 
part of a coherent whole, rather than individual tables.
After you enable the Data Analysis add-ins, you can add data sources to the Data 
Model, display the Data Model, and return to your main Excel workbook.
To enable the Data Analysis add-ins
1.	 Display the Backstage view, and then click Options.
2.	 In the Excel Options dialog box, click Advanced.
Scroll down to the Data group to enable the Data Analysis add-ins
3.	 In the Data group, select the Enable Data Analysis add-ins: Power Pivot, 
Power View, and Power Map check box.
4.	 Click OK.

Define relationships between tables
One of the fundamental principles of good database design is to store data about 
specific business objects, such as customers, products, or orders, in a table by itself, 
separate from the other tables in the database. For example, you might store data 
about customers in one table and data about shipments in another.
Display relationships between tables by using Diagram View
Each table has one column, or field, that contains a unique value for each row. This 
type of column, called a key, makes it possible to distinguish a row from every other 
row. For example, a table listing customers could have a CustomerID field as its key, 
with the same field appearing in a table named Orders, which tracks the date, time, 
value, and identity of the customer who placed each order.
TIP  The best keys are arbitrary numerical values. If you try to store information in a key 
field, you will likely run into issues of duplication that make processing your data harder, 
not easier.
434
Chapter 15: Perform business intelligence analysis

15
You can create connections between tables by identifying fields they have in common. 
For example, consider a Customers table that has two fields—CustomerID and 
­CustomerName—and an Orders table that has three fields—OrderID, CustomerID, 
and OrderPrice. The CustomerID field appears in both tables, so it can be used to 
establish a link, or relationship.
IMPORTANT  You must add Excel tables to the Data Model to define relationships 
between them.
In the Customers table, each CustomerID field value occurs exactly once, so that 
column is called a primary key. The CustomerID field also occurs in the Orders table, 
but because it’s possible for a customer to place more than one order, the CustomerID 
field’s values can repeat. When a key field appears in another table in which it doesn’t 
distinguish each row from every other row, it’s called a foreign key.
When you create a relationship, you link the primary key field from one table to the 
corresponding foreign key field in another table. Although it’s easier to spot the fields 
if they have the same name, such as CustomerID, they don’t have to have the same 
name—they just need to contain the same data.
Diagram View of a Data Model with a relationship between two tables
After you define a relationship in the Data Model, you can create PivotTables that use 
data from both Excel tables. You can also edit or delete relationships if necessary.

Define relationships between tables

Analyze data by using Power Pivot
When the Excel product team changed the underlying file format of Excel 2007 from 
.xls to .xlsx, they let users store much more data on each worksheet. Rather than limit­
ing each worksheet to 65,536 rows, you can now store up to 1,048,576 rows of data. 
In 2007, that larger number of rows seemed more than adequate for most Excel users. 
It still is, but the powerful business intelligence analysis tools built into Excel led users 
to import large data sets and to find ways to combine data collections that spanned 
multiple worksheets.
Originally introduced as an add-in for Excel 2010, Power Pivot is a tool you can use to 
work with any amount of data, as long as the total file size is less than 2 gigabytes (GB) 
and takes up less than 4 GB of memory. For such large data collections, you’ll usually 
work with summaries of your data, though you can focus on specific aspects of the 
data by sorting and filtering.
SEE ALSO  For more information about creating filters, see “Limit data that appears on 
your screen” in Chapter 5, “Manage worksheet data.”
When you bring a data collection into Power Pivot, Excel attempts to identify the 
data type of each column. The app is usually accurate, but some data types can be 
confused. For example, Excel will occasionally identify currency or accounting data 
columns as containing regular numbers that include decimal values. If this type of 
mistake happens, you can always change the column’s data type.
Power Pivot identifies some currency and accounting data as decimal numbers
438
Chapter 15: Perform business intelligence analysis

15
IMPORTANT  When you change the data type of a column, it might affect the column 
values’ precision and the results of calculations that are performed using the data.
Most large data sets contain raw data, such as sales amounts, and rely on the visual­
ization or summary software program to calculate values such as sales tax, commis­
sions, or profit. To add this type of summary to your Power Pivot data, you can define 
a calculated column. The formula syntax for creating a calculated column is very similar 
to creating a formula that refers to an Excel table column, so you already have the 
skills to create them.
As with columns in Excel tables, you can rename and delete Power Pivot columns, but 
the real analytical power of Power Pivot comes from creating PivotTables from the 
large Power Pivot data sets. Creating a PivotTable from 10,000 rows of data is useful, 
but creating a PivotTable from 10,000,000 rows can provide incredible insight.
To sort values in a column in ascending or descending order
1.	 In Power Pivot, while viewing a table in Data View, click a cell in the column by 
which you want to sort the table.
2.	 On the Home tab, in the Sort and Filter group, do either of the following:
●
●
Click Sort Ascending to sort the column’s values in ascending order.
●
●
Click Sort Descending to sort the column’s values in descending order.
TIP  The Sort Ascending and Sort Descending buttons will have different labels 
depending on the values in the column. For example, a number field will have 
the label Sort Smallest To Largest, whereas a text field will have the label Sort A To Z.
To clear a sort from a sorted column
1.	 In Power Pivot, while viewing a table in Data View, click a cell in the column by 
which you have sorted the table.
2.	 In the Sort and Filter group, click Clear Sort.
439

TIP  Excel creates a PivotTable by using all available data in the Data Model, not just the 
table that was displayed when you created the PivotTable.
View data by using timelines
Business data often records events at a specific point in time, whether a sale to an 
individual customer on a specific day or net profit for a quarter or a year. If your data 
contains a time-based value, such as the day of a sale, you can analyze that data by 
creating a timeline. 
Use timelines to filter PivotTable data based on time increments
442
Chapter 15: Perform business intelligence analysis

15
TIP  Timelines and Slicers are built on the same design philosophy: providing a visual 
indication of the elements included and excluded by a filter. What Slicers do for 
category data, timelines do for chronological data.
A timeline provides a graphical interface you can use to filter a PivotTable. For table 
columns that contain individual date values, such as 8/2/2015, the timeline box will 
recognize those dates and let you filter by year, quarter, month, or day.
Change the time increment by which you filter data by using a timeline
You can use the elements within a timeline to select individual increments, such as 
days or months, or ranges of those same values. As with other objects, such as charts, 
you can change the appearance of your timeline, resize it, change its appearance, hide 
or display elements, and delete it when it’s no longer required.
To create a timeline
1.	 Click a cell in an Excel table that is based on a connection to an external data 
source or that is part of the workbook’s Data Model.
2.	 On the Insert tab, in the Filters group, click Timeline.
3.	 In the Existing Connections dialog box, do either of the following:
●
●
Use the tools on the Connections tab to identify the connection you want 
to filter by using a timeline.
●
●
Use the tools on the Data Model tab to identify the Excel table you want to 
filter by using a timeline.
4.	 Click Open.

Bring in external data by using 
Power Query
Excel includes a wide range of analytical tools you can use to generate useful 
insights from your data. Excel 2016 includes Power Query, a versatile tool you can 
use to manage external data sources effectively. Unlike in previous versions of 
Excel, in which you needed to install Power Query as a separate add-in, Power 
Query is built into Excel 2016.
TIP  You don’t need to enable the Data Analysis add-ins to use Power Query, but they 
work best together.
You can create data connections to many different sources:
■
■
Files  These sources include Excel workbooks, CSV files, XML files, and text files.
■
■
Databases  These sources include Microsoft SQL Server, Access, SQL Server 
Analysis Services, Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, and Teradata 
databases.
■
■
Microsoft Azure  These sources include Azure SQL Database, Azure Market­
place, Azure HDInsight, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Table Storage.
■
■
Other sources  These sources include the web, Microsoft SharePoint lists, 
Hadoop files (HDFS), Facebook, Salesforce, and other sources with available 
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers.
446
Chapter 15: Perform business intelligence analysis

15
Creating a query involves identifying the type of data source to which you want to 
connect, selecting the software from among that type’s choices, and providing any 
necessary credentials to access the data source. Some systems require you to log on 
to an account to access your data, for example.
After you define your data connection, you can specify which elements of the data 
source you want to bring in. Many Excel files and databases contain multiple tables, 
so  you can select which of them to bring in.
Select the file element you want to use as your query data source
After your query data appears in an Excel table, you can work with it as you would 
any other data. You can unlock more powerful tools by turning on the Data Analysis 
add-ins and adding the Excel table to the Data Model. When the Excel table is part of 
the Data Model, you can define relationships between it and other tables to enhance 
your analysis.
Some data sources are poorly designed and don’t include an index field, which con­
tains a unique value for each row. If that’s the case, you can add an index, starting at 
the value of your choice and increasing in the increment you want, to provide the tool 
you need to create relationships between tables.
447

folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the introduction.
The new business intelligence tools built into Excel 2016 
greatly extend the app’s analytical and visualization 
capabilities. For example, though you have always been 
able to forecast future data based on current trends, you 
can now use an advanced technique called exponen­
tial smoothing to give greater weight to recent values 
instead of considering all historical data in the same light.
You can also use the Excel Data Model to create Fore­
cast Worksheets, measures, Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs), and 3D maps to visualize your data. Forecast 
Worksheets use exponential smoothing formulas to 
project future values in a visual display; measures and 
KPIs summarize and evaluate business data against 
goals you set; and 3D maps represent your data geo­
graphically, using maps to show static values and how 
your data changes through time.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating Forecast Worksheets, forecasting data by using 
formulas that define and manage measures, defining 
and displaying Key Performance Indicators, and creat­
ing 3D maps.
455

Create Forecast Worksheets
Excel 2016 extends your ability to analyze business data by creating forecasts. Analyzing 
trends in Excel isn’t new—you’ve been able to guess at future values based on historical 
data for quite some time. For example, you can create a linear forecast by using the 
FORECAST.LINEAR() function, which has the syntax FORECAST.LINEAR(x, known_ys, 
known_xs). The known_xs argument contains a range of independent variables, such as 
years, and the known_ys describe dependent variables, such as package volumes for a 
specified year. The FORECAST.LINEAR() function takes those historical values and 
projects the package volume for future year x if current trends continue.
A quick way to extend a data series is to select the cells that contain your historical 
data and then drag the fill handle down to extend the series. Excel analyzes the pat­
tern of the available values and adds new values based on that analysis.
IMPORTANT  The values used to create your Forecast Worksheet must be evenly 
spaced, such as every day, every seven days, or the first day of each month or year.
The standard exponential smoothing function, FORECAST.ETS(), returns the forecasted 
value for a specific future target date by using an exponential smoothing algorithm. 
This function has the syntax FORECAST.ETS(target_date, values, timeline, [seasonality], 
[data_completion], [aggregation]). The arguments used by this function are:
■
■
target_date (required)  The date for which you want to predict a value, expressed 
as either a date/time value or a number. The target_date value must come after 
the last data point in the timeline.
■
■
values (required)  Refers to the historical values Excel uses to create a forecast.
■
■
timeline (required)  Refers to the dates or times Excel uses to establish the order 
of the values data. The dates in the timeline range must have a consistent step 
between them, which can’t be zero.
456
Chapter 16: Create forecasts and visualizations

16
■
■
seasonality (optional)  A number value indicating the presence, absence, or 
length of a season in the data set. A value of 1 has Excel detect seasonality auto­
matically, 0 indicates no seasonality, and positive whole numbers up to 8,760 
(the number of hours in a year) indicate to the algorithm to use patterns of this 
length as the seasonality period.
■
■
data_completion (optional)  FORECAST.ETS() allows, and can adjust for, up to 
30 percent of missing data in a time series. A value of 0 directs the algorithm to 
account for missing points as zeros, whereas the default value of 1 accounts for 
missing points by computing them as the average of the neighboring points.
■
■
aggregation (optional)  This argument tells FORECAST.ETS() how to aggregate 
multiple points that have the same time stamp. The default value of 0 directs 
the algorithm to use AVERAGE, whereas other options available in the Auto­
Complete list are SUM, COUNT, COUNTA, MIN, MAX, and MEDIAN.
FORECAST.ETS.SEASONALITY() follows exactly the same syntax as FORECAST.ETS(), 
but it returns the length of the seasonal period the algorithm detects. As with 
­FORECAST.ETS(), the maximum seasonal period is 8,760 units.
You will often use FORECAST.ETS.SEASONALITY() and FORECAST.ETS() together, or 
FORECAST.ETS() by itself. The output of FORECAST.ETS.SEASONALITY() isn’t very 
useful without a forecast.
The final function, FORECAST.ETS.CONFINT(), returns a confidence interval for the 
forecast value at the specified target date. The confidence interval is the value that 
the actual value will differ from the forecast, plus or minus a certain value that Excel 
calculates, a specified percentage of the time. The function has the following syntax: 
FORECAST.ETS.CONFINT(target_date, values, timeline, [confidence_level], [seasonality], 
[data_completion], [aggregation]).
TIP  Smaller confidence_level values allow for smaller confidence intervals because the 
actual result doesn’t have to be within the confidence interval as often. Larger confidence_
level values require a larger interval to account for the greater probability of unlikely results.
457
Create Forecast Worksheets

The new argument, confidence_level, is an optional argument that lets you specify 
how certain you want the estimate to be. For example, a confidence_level value of 80 
percent would require the actual value to be within the confidence interval (plus or 
minus a certain value that Excel calculates) 80 percent of the time.
TIP  The default confidence_level value is 95 percent. 
Excel 2016 includes a new capability to create a Forecast Worksheet, which uses the 
FORECAST.ETS() function to create a line or column chart showing a forecast when 
given historical data. The Forecast Worksheet provides a striking visual summary of the 
exponential smoothing forecast. In addition to creating the forecast, you can control 
the start date, set seasonality, and determine how to handle missing or duplicate values.

Define and manage measures
You can use Power Pivot to analyze huge data collections that include millions or even 
hundreds of millions of rows of values. Although the details are important, it’s also 
valuable to examine your data in aggregate. This type of aggregate summary, such as 
the average of values in a column, is called a measure. 
461
Define and manage measures

Measures summarize columns of data in Power Pivot
SEE ALSO  For more information about using Power Pivot to analyze data, see “Analyze 
data by using Power Pivot” in Chapter 15, “Perform business intelligence analysis.” 
There are two main ways to define a measure in Power Pivot. The first is to use a 
version of AutoSum, which calculates a sum, average, median, or other summary of 
a Power Pivot column. The other method is to create a calculated column manually. 
Regardless of the technique you use to create your measure, you can always edit it or 
delete it if necessary.
To create a measure by using AutoSum
1.	 Open a workbook in which you have added at least one Excel table to the Excel 
Data Model.
2.	 On the Power Pivot tab of the ribbon, in the Data Model group, click Manage 
to display the Power Pivot for Excel window.
3.	 If necessary, in Power Pivot, on the Home tab of the ribbon, in the View group, 
click the Calculation Area button to display the Calculation Area of the grid.
4.	 In the Calculation Area, click the first cell below the column on which you want 
to base your measure.
462
Chapter 16: Create forecasts and visualizations

5.	 On the Home tab, in the Calculations group, do either of the following:
●
●
Click the AutoSum button to create a measure by using the SUM function.
●
●
Click the AutoSum arrow, and then click the function you want in the list.
To create a calculated column
1.	 In the Power Pivot for Excel window, display an Excel table that is part of the 
Data Model.
2.	 Click the first blank cell in the Add Column column.
3.	 Enter =, followed by the formula. 
TIP  To refer to fields in the Excel table, enclose the name in square brackets; for 
example, [Exceptions].
To edit a measure
1.	 Open a workbook in which you have added at least one measure to the Data 
Model.
2.	 If necessary, in Power Pivot, click the Calculation Area button to display the 
Calculation Area of the grid.
3.	 Click the cell that contains the measure, and then, in the formula bar, change 
the text of the measure’s formula.
4.	 Press Enter.
To delete a measure
1.	 Open a workbook in which you have added at least one measure to the Data 
Model.
2.	 If necessary, in Power Pivot, click the Calculation Area button to display the

Define and manage measures

Define and display Key Performance 
Indicators
Businesses of all sizes can evaluate their results by using measures, which summa­
rize overall business performance by summarizing operations data. The next step in 
this analysis is to compare results from a specific part of the business, whether for a 
department or for the entire company’s overall performance for a month, to deter­
mine whether the company is meeting its goals.
One popular way to measure business performance is by using Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs). A KPI is a measure that the company’s officials have determined 
reflects the underlying health and efficiency of the organization. A shipping company 
might set goals for maintaining a low level of package handling errors, or a charitable 
organization could set a goal for returning as much of its donation income as possible 
to their clients through service and direct support.
KPIs are most often implemented through a dashboard that summarizes organizational 
performance. In Excel 2016, you add KPIs to your workbooks by creating PivotTables 
based on data stored in the Data Model. 
A PivotTable that includes a Key Performance Indicator created in Power Pivot

Chapter 16: Create forecasts and visualizations

16
In some cases, high values are good, whereas in other cases low values are preferred. 
Both reducing package handling errors and maximizing operating profit would rep­
resent success for a shipping company, for example. A manufacturing firm might want 
to reduce variance in the items they fabricate for their customers. In that case, vari­

Create 3D maps
Much of the business data you collect will refer to geographic entities such as 
countries/regions, cities, or states. In Excel 2016, you can plot your data on 3D 
maps by using the built-in Power Map facilities. 
Summarize data by using a 3D map
After you add an Excel table to the Data Model, you can summarize its data geographi­
cally. All you need to do is click a cell in the Excel table and indicate that you want to 
create a 3D map. Excel examines your data source and, if it recognizes geographic enti­
ties such as cities or countries/regions, it adds the field to the map’s layout.
468
Chapter 16: Create forecasts and visualizations

16
TIP  If you haven’t clicked a cell in an Excel table that contains data you can use to create a 
map, Excel doesn’t add a geographic data field to the Location area of the Layers task pane.
With the 3D map in place, you can add data fields to its layout, supplement the display 
by adding a 2D line or column chart of the data, or change the fields used in the visu­
alization. If you have multiple geographic data levels available, such as country/region, 
state, and city, you can change the level of analysis before closing your map and return­
ing to the main Excel workbook.
Summarize data by geographical entity by using a 3D map
TIP  After you close the 3D Maps window, Excel adds a text box to the worksheet from 
which the 3D map draws its data, indicating that the workbook has 3D Maps tours 
available.
469
Create 3D maps

One real strength of 3D maps in Excel 2016 is the ability to create tours, which are ani­
mations of the data summarized in your map. If your data has a date or time compo­
nent, such as years, months, and days (or specific dates), you can create an animation 
that shows how the data changes over time.
IMPORTANT  The field you add to the Time box must be formatted by using a Date or 
Time data type.
After you create your map, you can copy an image of the screen to the Clipboard, 
save the animation as a video, edit the map, or delete the map entirely.
To create a 3D map
1.	 Click a cell in the Excel table that contains the data you want to map.
2.	 On the Insert tab of the ribbon, in the Tours group, click 3D Map.
3.	 If necessary, in the 3D Maps window, on the Home tab of the ribbon, in the 
View group, click Field List to display the Field List pane.
4.	 If necessary, drag the field that contains geographic information, such as states, 
from the Field List to the Location box.
5.	 Drag the field that contains the summary data from the Field List to the 
Height box.
6.	 If your data contains a third component, such as a company, drag the field that 
contains this category data from the Field List to the Category box.
To return to the main Excel workbook
1.	 Perform either of these steps:
●
●
In the 3D Maps window, display the Backstage view, and then click Close.
